I’m lvl 52 and would be happy to help / do what I can.
---
---
---
Platform?
---
How do you tag? Do you mean just get shots in?
---
That's fine. Any chance of a consistent legendary spawn is great. Watoga EMS was like that before gimp so this is it's replacement.

Sorry, PS4
---
Sounds like a plan...thanks!
---
Are you having freezes every 10 seconds or every now and then ?
---
PC. Good luck.
---
Forgot to mention it’s for the PS4
---
I'm still playing RDR2, I hope they don't go the way they did with gta5 and we get some single player dlc
---
It’s not for the faint of heart, but we know what we’re getting into before we log on.
---
Thanks.
---
Don't forget all pre-made mods are currently broken, just so you don't get any nasty surprises.
---
Lmao! My exact thought!
---
Welcome to the "beta male" generation...
---
It's very sad and disheartening...
---
Which system
---
Too bad they don't have tall sizes, you'd have just sold one for them.
---
I'm super scary, my dreams tell me this is gonna work.
---
On building there are 2 modes, camp and workshops. 
---
Camp building, there are limitations to where you can place them. Ultimately you can build a detailed cozy house or a large empty warehouse, allocated memory is limited but they have done some tricks to expand it. 
---
Workshops are dedicated areas with resources you can extract. The areas can be large and build memory a bit larger too. However workshops can be contended, aka stolen, when it is, you are open to pvp, even if you're not in the workshop. This can be used to grief. 
---
Currently camps can be attacked by other players but they are removing that in the future. Additionally resource nodes exist in the greater map itself, building your camp on it allows you to extract it as well.
---
Well i do have a lot of frame drops but actual freezes are a bit more rare but they do happen more than i wished they did,especially when i'm doing stuff on my pip boy
---
Old ps4 here that sound like a jet engine .. work fine for me
---
I started with 2 but ended with 3 … yeah, this means it's gonna work.
---
Tell me about it. That good old ps4 has worked many years and i haven't cleaned it once. But i usually don't have problems.
---
Yeah, on one character I got sturdy chest and legs on another I got heavy chest and arms ... but only cause I threatened team mates into giving em to me, but threatened the universe has yet to net me better luck, I'm gonna win this though I can taste it!
---
I saw a Robobrain War Mind the other day.  Can't help feeling they are up to something.
---
Store right behind super duper mart in watoga has 2 mags that spawn there got the last 4 I needed there
---
doom berserk mode!
---
I DONT NEED TO FILL IN THE DETAILS BE SCURRED!
---
What’s your tag?
---
Im going to get some serums from you but I only have one question. If I don't use a serum for a while, will it decompose (like is there a condition bar for it?)
---
What's your tolerance for bugs, glitches &amp; crashes like?
---
My favorite survival experience was attacking a guy in power armor who was sorting through his stash in a train station.  I shot him about 4 times with a hunting rifle and scraped him a bit before he noticed.  He half-heartedly returned fire a few times before he gave me a thumbs down emote and went back to sorting through his stash.
---
The sheer disinterest convinced me to just leave him alone.  It was an oddly positive experience.
---
Psn
---
The new one is when players spawn in and show up red and when shot they receive no damage when walking around.
---
Mmm...yes...looking forward to getting my bloodied explosive weight reduced handmade rifle.
---
pls
---
As long as it doesn’t drip progress or permanently stop my gameplay I tend to find ten funny more than annoying like on the division 2 a whole bunch of stuff just didn’t load so it looked like I was floating in the void but it didn’t stop me from playing it and actually made me laugh because I thought it was so funny, but that’s just me.
---
Well understand ya not using/doin this to make money but you are providing your time and providing a service but also helping those either unable to or like me sometimes to lazy to wanna run a silo i have no issues compensating someone like you for your time. 
---
I was more or less curious if youd be willing to sink the time involved in running 3 different silos, 3 different queens and a sheep all in on session.
---
Most people ive met seem to be an hour here or there type, not im here to play for next 4 hours types, and willing to do this repeatedly..
---
What are your normal play times? Im eastern and usually on from 7pm to 3am, if your time aligns with mine i may take you up on your offer from time to time since i am sitting on around 40 keycards at the moment.
---
You had to convince your wife to let you purchase something you already knew you wanted and would enjoy? Damn, man.
---
Savio0rtega
---
That's basically what I'm doing.
---
How much for the baton?
---
They tried to make every weapon class unique by having each one missing a perk type. But they didn't think very hard about it so some are vastly bigger deals
---
Since it’s ‘reroll’, we have to have the weapon first. We can’t roll something out of thin air. I’m guessing we can exchange unwanted legendaries for tokens, then pay tokens to gamble (re-roll). So my stalkers rolling pins will be turned into tokens first, I then pay the purveyor tokens so he will re-roll my three star junkies pipe gun, maybe after a few tries (pay each time) he will re-roll it into a bloodied pipe gun. I think that’s how it will work.
---
I have 7 out of 8 games and they most of them besides Nukatapper was basically random or   Just don’t pick up magazines at magazine spawn locations and jump servers but the probability is low.
---
I’m not on pc but I started getting that problem again. I reformatted the PS4 hard drive and reinstalled. You being on pc, you can probably just uninstall, scan for old files and reinstall. It fixed it for the most part for me.
---
Typically I reinstall the game fully after each patch or when I notice that I’m getting a lot more crashes. With those crashes and improper patches go through, it can corrupt files or make conflicting files that can lead to more crashes.
---
Again, I’m on PS4 but it could help your case.
---
Yep. PS4.  I nuked a fissure prime site and my server gave a message saying it would be shutting down for maintenance after on and off "connecting to server" messages or whatever it says.
---
I have more free time than I’d like to admit.  I totally get where you’re coming from.  It gives me satisfaction knowing I helped out even if it’s on a game lol. To sum it up, yeah I am always willing to grind. The only limitation is the IP timer.
---
Hopefully I don't get stuck with a bunch of shitty 3 star lead pipes. Lol
---
Engine wasn't built for multiplayer. I can only imagine how tricky jury rigging such a system in would be.
---
Though I'd certainly be impressed if they pulled it off.
---
What platform are you playing on?
---
I’m glad that turn out well for you, but what you experienced isn’t the norm. Survival mode wasn’t meant to be a place where when you engage in pvp with someone they’re mad at you as if what you’re doing isn’t how the mode should be played. It’s frustrating that people behave this way and even downvote this post as if what I’m saying is wrong.
---
I started attaching them to the outside, with a warehouse half wall on top and one of the "defense" lower walls, the one made up of vertical planks, so that i could run power through the gap. It also works really well as a turret defense/makeshift bunker. They can shoot out just fine, but melee enemies have to smash through the wall first.
---
Definitely. People acquire legendary at all levels and should be able to grow with their weapons, even if it cost some tokens.
---
OK, that's a pretty good example. Do that kind of thing every few minutes. If you think you can tolerate it, I say go for it!
---
You said bitch though?
---
I've never seen a legendary pipe revolver and don't know if they exist, but if they did that's all I would ever use.
---
I have a high tolerance, very high.
---
I recently started playing again I’m currently level 82 . I’ll join you ?
---
Nice, thanks for the tip! I’ll give it a try next time I rebuild :)
---
Im on xbox but ty.. idk if I wanna bother doing it yet until they fix it anyway
---
Shit xbox. I'm looking for help too😞
---
No way I'd be buying mods with this in mind. Though im pretty sure I have x01 calibrated shocks on ny bank character. It would be difficult to get to at this current time, as in away from my home xbox for the holidays. 
---
If you havnt found them by tonight I could see what I can do op.
---
protip: easier to beg forgiveness than ask permission.
---
Then I suspect you'll be alright. As a Fallout fan, I'd say it's the worst / on par with 4 for worst.
---
But as a Fallout themed survival spin off, it's thoroughly enjoyable. You just have to go in the the right mindset.
---
Correct it’s not going away
---
Uranium fever usually gives me something good compared to white springs. I'm sure it's just coincidence but its still my second favorite event next to one violent night
---
That's f'ing awesome,lol.
---
If she let him buy Fallout 76, she probably doesn't love him *at all*
---
Greedy tisk tisk
---
There is some truth to this. One of the few times I PvP'd early after the full launch, the person I killed had thousands of rare components in his inventory,lile nuclear material, ammo, and health items like radx and rad away. Being a new, low level character, you can bet your ass I grabbed ALL OF IT. Shared a bunch with my buddies too. Hadn't heard of, "duping" at that point, just thought I got lucky and harpooned me a whale.
---
I personally use T-60 because I like the way it looks and because of the BOS paints.
---
I could see it being Vault-Tec staff or an Enclave survivor.
---
It's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.. I just got it!!
---
Idk why, this made me chuckle..thx
---
hope you had a nice funeral bro
---
XBO
---
[removed]
---
im unsure of t45 and raider.
---
T60 is stupidly cheap to repair, i mean stupid cheap
---
Ultracite is a health balance of T51b and x-01. more "general purpose" between the 3
---
I’m level 55 and have no idea why excavator armour is no good for nuke zones 😭 is that why I used up so many radaways when I enter?
---
Did you learn anything from the experience?
---
Dont worry, watching people scatter as I chuck nuka grenades at them makes me chuckle too....well its more maniacal laughter than a chuckle, but same thing.
---
F
---
Doesn't exactly sound like a troll
---
In my ten times running sheepsquash,  she always chases me down if I’m the first conduit or if I run nearby as a conduit and closer than another. 
---
And since most people don’t do the conduit it means I spend most of the fight running in circles.
---
So funny
---
I'm on ps4 might be able to help you out
---
I’m sure it’s been said a dozen times. I just want Nuclear Winter to be a continuation of the current story. A mode where we have to deal with the repercussions of nuking Appalachia a million times to greedily farm for flux.
---
There is a craft able reward if you get all of them.
---
I had a pet lvl 5 radtoad, it was really cool (I knew i was home when i heard the ribbbbbbbbbet) but was killed by the molerats at my camp. Then I got a lvl 21 deathclaw as a pet that hangs out mostly inside my building, it keeps blocking the doors to in or out of my camp building but at least it kills the molerats.
---
If my deathclaw was traveling with me everyone would try to kill it, and it would be worse in the confusion of a nuke zone. If the pet cannot help you (ie: dogmeat), then i do not want it traveling with me as another thing to babysit and deal with it's issues.
---
As for rad resist, i know each armor has a different stat, which one has the highest though
---
What is it that I was supposed to learn? People are dicks and dont want to fight people there level? I have over 700 hours in game at this point and the only time I ever run into this is when I'm on a low level character
---
Awesome. What’s your psn?
---
x01 iirc wins in rad
---
Victornotcare
---
It gets even better when you see my character, pastors vestments, smiley surgical mask, welding goggles, all the face tats, throat stitch paint, and a mohawk, welding a shishkebab as he sprints at you full speed.
---
My T-60 is extremely easy to repair. Bit of a work horse. Ol' reliable.
---
One more thing.. I found the thread about biased legendary drops based on what in your stash or on your person. This seems to be true. I have a *** legendary revolutionary sword I use regularly for clearing out mobs and since I've been using it regularly I keep getting *** revolutionary swords (crappy effects tho). Same with my mg42. Got a nice ** mg42 use it as a high level mob clearing weapon.  After I got that and stated using it, I had three More drop (* and varying effects). If you are fishing for a specific weapon/effect keeping that kind of weapon and weapons with the desired effect(s) in inventory can help nudge the RNG in your favor. This could be cicumstancial, but it really seems like there is a bias on drops.
---
Did they increase after the lying Lowe quest line was added ?
---
Lol..holy crap. Yeah I would scream and run!
---
Cool I'm on XB
---
Gonna try those perks.. Thanks for the tip!
---
It broke in the last patch.  I haven’t seen any word yet on when it will be fixed, but it extends to weapons and regular armor too.
---
Hm not sure but that's possible
---
Well, they mentioned Morgantown so Vault-Tec isn't out of the picture.
---
:) thanks. This is gonna be fun.
---
How many friends do you have on psn because someone else on this sub said he had a lot of people on his friends and after he got rid of around 300 it began to work better
---
You tried a shredding minigun?
---
[link](https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/rtrnofdmax/video/68555963)
---
i got a spare white Russian recipe i can give you, my gt is sgtmajfoiey
---
I clear west tek a few times, take every assault rifle and laser rifle, use the mentat that gives you better deals and sell everything to the closest vendor. Doesn’t take long plus I get a few levels out of it
---
Uhm i have 59
---
I’m actually on PS4
---
Instigating lever action and furious 50cal are both very nice weapons, get a good value for them ;)
---
Well it’s probably not that then
---
Yessir
---
Ah, oh well
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Cool not to flex but I got a full set of ultracite and excavator power armor I’m alkali level 57
---
I’ll send ya an invite in just a sec. I’ll wait outside the whitesprings
---
Wow... just wow, I have a bloodied faster firerate minigun. I need the mod 😮
---
Snap the metal pillar to the middle of the stairs. Place a second pole on top of the first. Remove the first pole leaving the second pole floating in mid air. Then you can snap a stair set to the bottom of the floating pole so they sit on top of each other. Build stairs how high you want before adding floors or walls. It’s tricky but doable.
---
I've been doing runs of West-tek the last couple days - doesn't take all that long but you get decent exp, a 3 star enemy or two and if you pick up all the weapons you should pretty much have the 1.4k caps covered if you use hard bargain 3. It's also not TOO far from the nearest vendor - I usually just point myself in the right direction, start walking and browse Twitter on my phone.
---
Right now, Apex Legends and WoW.
---
All we really know is that Todd Howard said (at PAX) it will be a token system of some kind. Trade in legendaries, get more tokens based on the number of stars, use those tokens to reroll effects. 
---
I’m saving everything lightweight; armor limbs, melee weapons, pistols etc. If it’s all about the stars, then a 3* Gatling laser is worth less than 20 3* knuckles. Don’t know if I’m right, but that’s the hand I’m playing.
---
What the build? And just regular chainsaw?
---
If you're trying to make caps, as other people have said, make sure you're using hard bargain and grape mentats; they increase the amount of money you get from vendors a great deal. Also, bulk and sell junk regularly. Pick up all the weapons that drop, scrap them, and then bulk out the steel and sell that. Drugs you don't use? Sell them. I keep a stock of 50 stimpaks and 50 radaway on me at all times, and whatever I have over that amount, I sell. I sell all but 6 super stimpaks. I sell all the radx I pick up. Glowing blood sells well, as does purified water.
---
Once you get the hang of it, 1400 caps is generally pretty easy to max out. Most days, I'll buy a plan that I don't have, just to refill the vendor a little so that I can get rid of more garbage I'm carrying around. If you get to that point, remember that you want to exhaust the vendor as far as you can before buying anything, because no matter what you buy, the vendor will only max out at 1400 caps, so buying a 1000 cap plan when the vendor still has 1200 caps on them is a waste.
---
I don't know about pipe since I don't have that card, but Gunslinger and Rifleman definitely stack for both pipe revolvers and pipe bolt-action with a rifle stock.
---
Hm i don't know maybe i've just been playing too much
---
Its kind of interesting, but it seems like most of the folks in survival are mainly playing for the xp boost instead of pvp now.  Back at the beginning, if you saw a yellow dot, it would turn red and they would inevitably engage you.  Now there's a better chance they'll just run away and keep playing the game.
---
So I wonder if it -was- a pvp mode and now its more of an adventure with friendly fire.  If that's the case then I can understand why people might get salty.  Though being whiney and messaging seems a bit much.  It'll be interesting to see what defacto standards of engagement start to form... and how those break down when the developers mess with the rewards in adventure and survival.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
I got smacked by a big ugly thing once and decided to not go back for my body lol.
---
Personally I think adventure mode is far more grief filled as people can easily find you on the map and pester you. This idea that being killed by other players in a game is griefing so misguided in my view. I do agree however that the implementation of events is survival mode is off and needs work, forced co op that is abruptly switched off upon completion is a very problematic and does invite griefing. Saying it's a griefing server what do you expect is pretty stupid when it's a problem of a specific botched mechanic.
---
Love it! Many nice little design choices... and "eat people" made me laugh
---
There is no build with this i think... I think as long as you have adrenal reaction and a lot of strength at low health it’s good
---
On XB1 it still sucks. I mostly bought a new console for this game. 
---
Maybe the more player  demand... the more it crashes. Wednesday last week the server dropped 4 times.
---
Yes this has been happening when I try to put recon on my XO1 helm
---
Happened to me the other day but instead of bloodied laser it was a 2* bloodied handmade with extra bash damage :( I was so excited when I saw the name
---
The thing is that I have a LOT of unbeaten games. So I’m supposed to start clearing some of my list before I get a new one.
---
I dunno can you undilute your crack?
---
That’s why you go heavy weapons- Unyielding doesn’t do much for HW. Just sit there and spray lead. And E Protocol torso is sexy.
---
Makes sense. Thanks for the input!
---
A level 50 should be able to pimp slap anything in Forrest, Toxic Valley, and Ash Heap, saving all ammo. By then, only multiple scorchbeasts should cause a problem.
---
I've just come across a two-shot plasma gun. This sounds like it'll be fun.
---
Yeah I had to do like 100 personally but that was a couple months back.
---
I don’t know. I’ll have to check when I get off work
---
Raider is the only early game power armour, so I guess it has that going for it. Think it's repair is fairly cheap too.
---
I still use it occasionally just because I love all that rebar and the helmet is my favourite. 😅
---
... do you even read, brah?
---
Why’s that worse? At least that benefits from having armor reduction mag. Poor energy weapons :-(
---
I am 99% you can learn it from scrapping miniguns. Grind out some Muties. 
---
Bash damage is a better secondary. Only gun you want it on.  
---
The chainsaw wins on weapon durability. That thing never breaks while a minigun will break much faster than you want. Fun while it lasts.
---
I like it.  Classic.  Can I use it?
---
Could tinman be a code name? This person could be some sort of pre war fbi type or someone who knew about the enclave or vault tech. Tinman coukd be a handler name.
---
Just my 2 caps.
---
But if I recall, the scrap ingredients are cork and leather.
---
But, glad I didn't quickly hit yes, scrap all....
---
And your view is, in my view, absolute garbage. This isn't a first person shooter. It isn't rust. 
---
When you _exploit_ game mechanics to kill people, you're a _griefer_.  Murdering people at events? That's a fucking griefer move. Having a friend in a group in adventure poke at a owned workshop so you can murder someone at their camp? You're a griefer.
---
"it's just pvp" is bullshit, because every single example I can think of that isn't someone walking up to someone _on the PVP server_ or _at a workshop_ is a griefer.
---
I believe a patch to fix it is coming out next week
---
Wait so the bashing damage legendary effect would help the damage for minigun shedder
---
actually it still using N&amp;D, but changes links automatically
---
Why do you need permission?
---
I just counted out the perks (I did non-explosive heavy weapons vs semi-automatic rifles, I'm sure if you add in explosives and automatic rifles it's still pretty similar) and heavy weapons has one more perk that modifies it, along with better armor armor penetration (heavy weapons gets 45% vs rifle's 36%). I would say that heavy weapons are objectively better.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I still use a sneaky sniper build because it's doable, but between weight reduction, easier ammo production for .50 and 5mm, and better armor shredding, I think heavy weapons is in a better place right now.
---
All pre-made mods are currently broken. A Bethesda staff member commented on a few of these threads and said it was being sorted in the next patch.
---
Fingers crossed.
---
🤞
---
I believe they are over all the most powerful guns in the game. So they have to give some type of drawback to useing them.
---
The developers never meant for survival to be more of an adventure mode. That’s why we get the warning before we log on. The stakes are higher. Pvp restrictions have been lifted. It’s meant to keep you on your toes.  XP is just an incentive. The issue that I take with people who do these things is their mindset. I always wonder what they expect. The problem is that these kind of players think that they can log on to survival and play like they’re in adventure. Nothing can be further from the truth.
---
I hope so,  picked up a few mods and been waiting to install them to be more competitive in pvp.
---
Odd right? It’s a holdover from FO4. The basher perk also helps. None of the heavy weapon perks help. Nor the melee perks.
---
How many radroaches for a stable server?
---
I’m fairly certain I can come up with a build to solo the event with... key components being a vampire heavy weapon (I’ve got a 50cal and a LMG) and all the right perks, plus power armor. I’m still debating if trying to live at low health and maintain high damage and Emergency Protocols, or using an autostim chest, will be better. I can already tank the sheepsquatch pretty damn well with my quick and dirty sheepsquatch tank setup only partially there. Swapping in faster HW reload perks, adding speed demon, and getting a Vampire 25% fire rate 15% reload rate would basically make me self healing indefinitely. Pop a stim before reloading, and reload would take like 1-2 seconds with all the buffs. Stack up some health buffs from chems, food, and alcohol and you could push 500 max health while still putting out solid DPS.
---
Recall keycards circuit board. Used to summon the sheepsquatch imposter.
---
Fallout 76 bad amirite guys
---
Wait lemme get this straight, if I want to use the shredder on the minigun, I would have to perk in to bashing damage and get a bloodied mini gun with bashing damage
---
Enough to buy a few plates of tendies and 20 mountain dews
---
those sweet lvl 40 legendaries
---
I think the eggs will be better than the reward ( from what I have seen ).
---
Nope.
---
I'd agree with you for the most part, do I do think the developers are trying to change it into a full adventure style more than pvp.  The fact that the weapon challenges all require you to do adventure-like tasks and the cap rewards aren't that great mean there's more incentive to play adventure-y than to engage other players.
---
I personally like how it plays now.  Others generally leave me alone to play, but I still have to be smart about my build so I can run away when needed.  The added risk adds a good bit of fun to it.
---
Hey, Dirty....baby I got your money.
---
I never got the first one, sad times.
---
Thanks you for your help!
---
Yesss!
---
I use x01 for everything but use excavator to farm ore and carry it with me at all times in case I get over encumbered.
---
Oh my Lord I am buying this.
---
I would just keep collection it. There might be a way to obtain missing eggs. We won’t know for sure till later.
---
To get maximum DPS, yes. You can put the shredder mod on and take it off without restriction.
---
I feel bad for rifle builds. My .50 Cal HMG weighs less than two sodas.
---
I do agree with you, just saying that a user is not invincible. People should be ready with a vats headshot on these guys. It's all it takes.
---
Ok so I’m gonna get a bashing damage minigun... wow
---
What are you on about? Obviously exploiting game mechanics to kill people is griefing that's what this post is about. It's the characterisation of the whole survival mode as grief mode that is stupid. If you don't think fallout should have open PVP then stick to adventure but trying to say what this game is supposed to be based on your preference for co op PVE is just wrong. Fallout 76 isn't supposed to be a non rust non PVP game, adventure mode is and a lot of people think that is lame and boring, thankfully Bethesda is catering to both audiences.
---
LubricatedSnake I'm on alot during the night because of my job.
---
Been suggested every day since the beta. Theres a mod for it on the nexus. One day...
---
I like this.
---
I don't know if it's cannon, but I like to imagine that the states survived the war with minimal nuclear damage... but then 76 dwellers (and otheres across the country like them) just completely leveled everything for poos and giggles.
---
O really?
---
Yep the thrill of the hunt, and finally securing the sweet sweet broadsider kill
---
I'm not down voting you or criticising you so please don't accuse me of such. I merely asked for proof to back it up so we can all be aware of what's happening. Anecdotal evidence is so hard to go on though. Like I said previously, by submitting bug reports it goes straight to Bethesda, that really is the best route.
---
Mine wont load 😶
---
That looks like an unreleased responders suit we only got the black and the red one
---
I had to power my console down and reload everything.
---
Is this game still relevant too?
---
Live loud and free, bro.  I'm sure some lvl 200 guy in power armor would have helped you you out.  The 76 community is great.
---
A homie wants his eggos
---
Lol reminds me of Buddy vs. Mirelurk Queen
---
L'eggo my eggo
---
Limb damage prefered to bash damage. Wasnt thinking about the mods on energy weapons.
---
I’d start slow until you understand how quickly these things break. 
---
You on Xbox? I’ll loan you a Furious 1* with a shredder so you can test it out.
---
go to the southern belle motel, find a note on a table near boomer, and read it to start a misc quest. complete it for the wendigo plans.
---
Just wanna crack an egg open and get that deathclaw omelette
---
2nd one never appeared for me
---
So miffed
---
Thats hilarious though. Salt right up!
---
Use the Perk Loadout Manager at nexusmods.com. I’ve used it for a few weeks and it really simplifies things.
---
Nope PS4, but I was offered a bloodied bashing minigun today so I’m gonna try to get it
---
No 45k is right if you stack everything right
---
Mmm, tasty!
---
yes
---
yeah can't do it that way either. Thanks
---
I just quit the game app and reload. That's what gets it to show for me.
---
Hey, I got the game on PC a few days ago and wouldn't mind having some help with the more difficult quests. Only thing is that I'm level 20ish right now.
---
This is definitely a big problem and feels really off. Im tempted to prefer no forced co op at all as that feels far more organic but maybe that would mean tweaking events a bit to make them more completable without help. Also I believe you should not be able to fast travel directly to events and as the player triggering it you should be able to decide if you want to make it broadcasted to the whole server or not. As a player who exclusively plays survival I've had big issues with events from the start, I think they were clearly designed with adventure mode in mind and don't translate well at all to survival.
---
We can only wish, tbh they make so much money from online that I don’t see it happening, but I’m optimistic so hopefully lol
---
Thanks for the info.
---
5 as of today
---
A fissure in street claimed me early on as well, long before I actually knew what the hell they were.
---
You will have six if you collect the one tomorrow.
---
No, the route I described is for when you fast travel to top of the world. It's in a makeshift store front outside.
---
My pleasure. Spread the word!
---
So last one is black,and why people saying something will happen like I don't want to summon some boss in my camp so if u know tell me pls
---
There are a lot of theories right now but nothing is confirmed. We will have to wait and see.
---
So if I have traded in three 1-star lead pipes, maybe I get three tokens. Then, I trade in a Handmade Rifle and re-roll the RNG on a 3-star handmade? That seems too logical for Bethesda to implement properly and glitch-free so I'm not gonna hold my breath.
---
Haha! :)
---
It's a bunny mascot head
---
Thanks!
---
Any time my friend! Mind you I haven't played 76 in a couple months so I sincerely apologize if this doesn't work anymore.
---
Well if so glad I did not collect all them.
---
Yep, PC. We can work something out. I’ll be on again tomorrow morning. About 12 hours from now
---
I'm going to the store, when I get back do you want to coop? I am level 11 or 12 now. Not sure how useful i can be.
---
Truth, but RDR2 really doesn't have the flashy show off luxuries GTA5 used to keep people coming back, I mean really how many horses could you bring in that I would want to grind for
---
Not sure. Sorry
---
still need help?
---
I’m on consoles
---
Sure. I’ll be on again tomorrow morning. About 12 hours from now
---
No, serums don’t spoil.
---
As much as Im benefitting from it, they need to remove the XP boost.
---
Imagine the frame rate during the SBQ fight or a nuke with potentially up to 24 ghoul imps running around with alpha effects.
---
I have a long list of unbeaten games that she said I have to beat before I get new games.
---
Someone did try to help me. I thought I accepted their invite but apparently I didn’t. Then I died
---
Yeah but if I wanted to move my camp, I would've selected that option when the prompt first appeared. But if I choose to move to a new server, the space should be free in the new server. Jumping from server to server 8 times is just ridiculous and I end up moving my camp for free out of pure frustration, not because I want to
---
I've been looking for this forever. Better than the three wolf shirt on Amazon.
---
No, but _everything_ I hear about survival mode PVP involves people exploiting game mechanics to force people into fighting.  Every change I see to survival is to make it somewhat playable, provide access to basic shit like vendors without being auto-murdered.
---
That's an amazing find! It costs you less than what it would have cost you for a item from the  Atomic Shop. Lol!
---
Tomorrow is a holiday for me so I do not know what time I will be on but I did send you a friend request.
---
Selling unscrapped weapons and chems. Bulk junk too.
---
I’m having the same problem with jetpack. I also can not put mods on my gun now. This is game breaking.
---
Well I only play survival and that's not my experience at all. It is pretty easy to avoid people if you play cautiously, especially as you aren't always visible on the map and the players per server is pretty low for the size of the map.
---
Well it was pretty boring and I only got 2 masks after running it several times. But according to Beth the 'feedback was great', so more boring stuff I guess.
---
I just like building stuff.
---
Might try it later.   This was with my second character.  When frustrating stuff happens with an alt I just go back to playing my main lol.
---
This thread started 11 days ago and it hasn’t been fixed yet? Come in Devs, this is hurting your loyal players.
---
Nah, maybe to you but definitely not the majority
---
Absolutely.
---
I still get crashes fairly often. Maybe like once every 4 hours of play. Most commonly in the form of a blue screen. I'm on PS4 Pro.
---
Everything everyone said. Plus i always hav excess purified water so ill sell a bunch of that every other day.
---
I hear you. My main knows damn near all plans to make everything, including mods. I started a new character that’s 77 now and it’s frustrating when I get something new that I want to try out but can’t modify it until I transfer lol. It’s not a big deal but I’ll admit that I’m spoiled by my 380ish.
---
Your tears and this sweet salty post makes it all the while.
---
Is your friend higher level than you?
---
Yeah it's true this surfaced pretty early last week. I don't know why the hell Bethesda didn't do a hot fix. It's the kind of thing they have addressed quickly in the past. It's infuriating.
---
I’m level 17something and I still need to do this mission to lol. I just can’t bring myself to go find all those key cards
---
But the beauty of online interactions is that you are nowhere near as vunerable IRL.
---
Need!
---
I kind of want to buy a new one as well but then again the ps5 probably releases fairly soon and ps4 will be playable on it so i gotta be patient
---
I’ve had 9 at one time. I was doing nearly 1000 damage with a junkies explosive double barrel.  The biggest problem i had was maintaining all the addictions as they are not permanent.
---
We just don’t know, but I’m sure it’s not going to be a 1 for 1 system like that. 
---
I imagine something like: 
---
Get 1 token per star you trade in. Save up those tokens, then spend them on rerolls. 
---
Reroll a single star on an item, 10 tokens, 2 stars 50 tokens, 3 stars, 100 tokens—though those numbers are probably low. 
---
It’s still going to be RNG, so there will be plenty of opportunity for disappointment no matter how it turns out.
---
Yeah well i have crashes as well but sometimes it literally just freezes for like 30 seconds or a minute, sometimes it goes back to normal, sometimes it crashes
---
I did it with Bufftats. I waited until we were dropping in the fluid before using mine to make sure it didn't run out.
---
Did they just spawn and have no guns out? If so that is PvP spawn protection. You can be taken to 1 but until you pull a gun out you cant die to pvp damage.
---
Wait. I hate the XB 1. I have had every Xbox and this is the worst.
---
You should buy a ps4 then :)
---
I definitely agree. When Beth first talked about Survival mode, it was never a free-for-all mentality. Sure, people made it that way at first, but now I think it’s a lot closer to what they were going for. It isn’t full of people actively seeking to kill other players. Rather, running into a random player is a rarer experience, and far more tense. If you aren’t automatically hunting for players to kill, there is always a question of whether they will try to kill you. And if they do, will you be able to respond?
---
Wow arent you original rofl
---
Vampires explosive makes you virtually invincible while running a low health adrenal reaction build.  As long as you have something to shoot, that is.
---
I'm sorry, he's from Robco. It would be easier training a molerat.
---
Free junk and laughs.
---
We gotta put disclaimers in our feedback now? Wild Appalachia ain't wild. It's pretty damn tame.
---
If thousands of people say " thats boring" that's effective feedback Id say.
---
You are a saint but I think I missed out on one
---
Cool, sounds like a good time. 🙂
---
Rub it in... :p
---
;)
---
You’ve gotta be Built perfectly and then drink a nukashine w the level 3 alcohol perk for 300% unarmed dmg then use a glowing meat steak and physcotats w whatever the drug perk is you can only do 45k for a abt a min tho
---
Don't worry, I'm 100% they're not going to hatch or anything. The tamed creatures have such bad pathing, a spawn inside a camp would probably get stuck in the walls or foundation.
---
Haha sorry, i actually don't think there's much of a difference. Except the exclusives that's why i own a ps4
---
Were u on it when u completeded the quest?
---
It may be a bull, or she may have a restraining order against you, what have you done with other farm animals in other games?
---
Not a good weapon. a Bloodied weapon which requires close range?  
---
Yeah, nty.
---
Congratulations haha!, I personally have really enjoyed the game in the beginning but after finishing the quests and not having anything to do it becomes rather tedious and boring, especially when the game crashes or some other glitch happens and it just puts you right off, I'm sure once they've done all the updates n stuff they need to do that it will be an amazing game. If you just take a look at fallout 4 it wasn't amazing in the beginning and now through dlc and patches etc it's a pretty good contribution to the fallout series, won't ever compare to NV or FO3 though but those were the golden days.
---
My wife loved watching me play FO4. I bought her very own Xbox and we travel the wasteland together. She is handicapped due to an accident and it gives us the ability to roam together. I made level 124 and she is level 24. She's a much better crafter and scrounger than me. She's good with a .44 tho. 😁
---
I prefer mole miners to people and robots and terminals.
---
Ok  yeah, that makes more sense.
---
I have a level 40 quad assault rifle with 50% limb damage and 1 agility.
---
Lol
---
Is the only way to get these recipes from Biv quests?
---
Yeah, I tried verifying the game files, didn't help. Uninstalling and re-installing now, hopefully, that will fix this issue. It's only in Blackwater Mine which is weird.
---
My guess is the next fallout will be out within 4 years, and FO76 will have servers for 8 or so. It will change drastically in content, and fixed where broken.
---
It's a daily called Ecological Balance. Go investigate the trailer near Tygart Water Treatment.
---
you have shattered their psyche or maybe self importance?  
---
ever watch ready player one? remember the moms boyfriend, he lost had to blame something/someone cause ya know he bought all this gear he was gonna win.   
---
some think the gear they have, doesnt matter where they got it either, found or bought and then running through a storyline killing npcs with no deaths makes them believe they are awesome and godlike in the game, then they run into a better player and that image they have of themselves gets completely shattered. they lash out. usually its either the young or very arrogant.  
---
im decently geared for pve anyways and im old, i avoid survival cause i know id get waxed by most everyone cause im not very good at pvp especially against some of the more high end maxed out gear, so those like me that would expect to get wasted and wouldnt really have an issue other than "well shit, i got killed" wont usually be on there.  
---
most of those you run into that will blow up like that honestly believe there is no one else in the game better than they are, and there isnt much you can really do about it. more than likely after they lash out at you through messages and so on id say likely they reported you for cheating because well you had to have since you beat them..   
---
doesnt make any sense but usually the way it goes down.
---
sorry ya had to deal with that. seems to be alot more prevalent nowadays than it used to be years ago.. but thats what happens when everyone gets a trophy..   
---
now im gonna take my cane, go back to my porch, and yell at these bastards stepping on my grass.. have a good night.
---
It’s part of a quest, and daily quest.  Called ecological balance.
---
Good stuff!!! Very cool.
---
If you want to hit me up add me GT is BigBangTheory73 
---
I am most likely on daily playing and doing something in fallout.
---
I bought my husband the game for his birthday.
---
Bought my copy the same day.
---
Well, think of it this way: Internal combustion engines power cars, airplanes and houses too, but can they be turned into a mech?  Wheels are incredibly efficient for moving across open ground, because you never have to overcome the weight of the vehicle, only the friction caused by moving sideways, With legs you have to constantly lift the leg as well.
---
There's also usually 2-3 under the power pylon next to Hemlock Holes Maintenance.
---
Quad explosive reduced weight hunting rifle
---
I hit up everywhere I know that has ticks, then make all the stimpacks I can carry with Chemist and Super Duper to increase the amount I get. They sell pretty well with Hard Bargain.
---
This was by far the best comment I’ve seen on reddit, lol.
---
I've got an interesting issue with my rifleman build where I have an armor piece that reduces weapon weights by 20%, but that means I lose that when I hop in power armor. What this means is that if I don't have a decent buffer of weight, I'll be overencumbered if I get in anything but my Excavator armor, lmao. It's great!
---
The wife got me it for xmas! She knows it that one series of games that I will have as soon as it drops
---
Jesus that escalated quickly 😂, rather rude to call a complete stranger's other half that when you don't know them what so ever and it's over a game, most people in relationships don't like gaming, more so women more than guys but not being sexist as I've seen guys getting pissed at their girlfriends for gaming alot but tends to be predominantly women, but none the less very harsh, just shows how much respect you have for females in general.., on a side note, try not to let it interfere with like spending time with your other half, make sure you take her out and make a big fuss, dinner out etc, then when you want to relax and game it up you have all right to and if she gets annoyed then just kindly remind her of that night etc and in my case she usually gets all sentimental and is like aw okay I suppose so but ends up forgetting so I end up playing away for ages 😂
---
I dunno, i picked up 200 pounds of junk the other day from a level 14
---
Congrats. I have a TSE Handmade as a sniper rifle and its great.
---
I'm abandoning the game. How to compete?
---
Yep, shoot it when its vulnerable. I shot it when it was invulnerable before grabbing all pylons and got no rewards. (First time I did the event. I was young and stupid.)
---
That’s exactly why I originally wanted to wait a while before starting. Hopefully by the time I get that point they have some bugs fixed.
---
made a separate comment about this but I'm gonna retype some of it anyway, I have the problem that with a piece of that, sometimes getting in my non-excavator power armor overencumbers me if I don't have a low enough weight on me, it's fuckin neato
---
They can smell fear?
---
Mods that affect item weight work by a function called "MUL+ADD", where it adds up all of the weight modifiers, then multiplies it against the base weight. If you have a weapon that's normally 10 lbs and a few mods that together push it up to 20, then the Weightless legendary modifier will only knock off 9 lbs (i.e. (1-0.9+1)=1.1, 1.1\*10=11).
---
If I could get my wife to play that would be us too. She loves building
---
My hubby doesn't play video games but that sounds awesome.
---
I'm shaking in my boots.
---
I agree completely. I've been using an unarmed build lately and the instigating power fist can one shot damn near everything that isn't a level 90 deathclaw. There are very few essential perks outside of strength. Compared to that, my friend with a rifles build is constantly strained for perk allotment.
---
Psn epicduck00, ill be on in 30 min, I have tons nuclear keycards
---
and change the challenges from doing adventure stuff to killing players stuff..  
---
kill XX amount of people.  
---
take over and hold a workshop for XX minutes  
---
or even multiple workshops..  
---
needs to be the incentive there to make people fight if they want that to work better.  
---
i went after the sole survivor because well its a lever and my main is a rifle build.. i didnt run into any pvp things until like my last two events, last one its like damnit i am finishing this event i dont care how many times i have to die to this guy.. (had two trying to ruin the event killing the players doing the event.. i just fought them and the event mobs at same time i wasnt givin up). but there was a serious lack of danger through out my whole survival experience.
---
Yeah that was my hope and was all good until the most recent patch now work benches mess up and my game crashes and I lose frames so badly it's barely playable, I'm currently focusing on fo4 and getting all achievements :)
---
Sweet, do I have to get em? I’m so ready for that mission to be cleared, I’m like a 170 something haha, just been avoiding it because of the last requirement
---
I wish I could get the flamer mod on my chainsaw, cause right now its sitting at 2 damage.
---
They added in Sanctuary houses? Got a link?
---
PM. I have a vampiric lever action I believe but I’m not sure if it’s 3*. I’ll be back at my computer in a few days and I can check then
---
I have bought them but not placed them...lack of time not that I think anything will happen
---
I got a legendary drop that was a stalkers security baton. It adds accuracy and such when out of combat and is completely useless.
---
I prefer terminals rather than humans
---
Why on earth would he have that much on him? What is wrong with people?
---
Who ever puts the code in need the card, and u still get the question done
---
I'm just talking about the reduction of gameplay to an arbitrary single sentence of a feature. People can be bored and they can share that.
---
It's my wild speculation, but with the reuse of models and assets, I think they will monetize or add in anything they can from FO4. I think they will do more premade assets in the future, as they already exist and should be easy to utilize.
---
The sad thing is even rifles made during WW2 weighed 8 to 9 pounds and was considered heavy when some Armalite rifles weigh 7-8  pounds which is pretty standard now a days but 6 pounds is also considered light too. What's really stupid that semi/Auto receiver weighs roughly 2 pounds to switch around just so they can shoot in full auto and do a little bit more damage. The only way rifles have reasonable weight is if you keep the rifles standard all around which then they weigh 9 to 10 pounds which isn't terrible but definitely not realistic. My handmade weighs 16.4 pounds with a powerful auto receiver, reflex, suppressor and quick mag which only holds 20 rounds not even the standard 30rds and a long barrel because for some reason the short barrels weigh more.
---
Really? Im about to hop on and get my things together and shoot you an invite 
---
I’ll be IProject IPat
---
I’m hardly ever in power armor. I like to whip it out for just special occasions.
---
I'll be on in 20-ish min
---
Yes, they do reuse assets. I don't think they will be adding the houses from Sanctuary however. Your post made it sound like they were revamped and going to be sold somehow. I don't really think so.
---
I demand a pet rock!
---
I think plan drops are based on how many mods exist, and each roll is a random roll based off of that. So since there is just one mod for the BP, it's a very very slim chance.
---
I love the music. Just discovered this now!
---
They do but I’ve only seen 1 stars.
---
Tactical Marine Helmet. 1 glass 1 plastic 3 rubber. At 4 base charisma it sells for 30 caps each with hard bargain and grape mentats. Craft 35-40 once per day and done.
---
God yes PLEASE. I dont even need a full fledged companion pet like in standard Fallouts, I will GLADLY take vanity pets
---
I have a be lever, aae lever, be pump  and a tse handmade. The lever has way higher damage per shot in my build but I often switch to the handmade. The rate of fire is like 5 times faster and with the drum I have 85 rounds on deck. So I snipe with my levers and switch to the tse when enemies start closing the gap and get closer. I really want a be handmade tho. The shotgun wrecks as far as dps but I take so much damage from it! And I’m not specked for a shotgunner build so I’ve been keeping it put up for trade purposes (hopefully towards that be handmade! Lol)
---
Ohh fffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu
---
When they remove camp damage, it should in theory not allow players to kill your tamed pet.
---
No problem! :)   
---
I suggest getting Rank 3 in "Super Duper", and then crafting a bunch of the lowest-level Gauss, just to scrap to learn the mods. It'll result in getting a couple of free guns. *(Out of about 20 I probably had gotten 4 or 5 extra for free that way.)*
---
Just gave some lvl 6s and 14 some PA frames too lol Came across 3 piece of Raider lvl 15, and didn't want his teammates to feel left out, so I scrounged up two extra frames for them :P  
---
Same thing happened to me when I first started. A lvl 90-something rolled into my little shack and displayed some 15 PA frames, and gave me one. I was so blown away by that *(even though I now know it's easy to find them)*. Since then I've made it a point to gift stuff to folk even since! I leave tons and tons of scrap, ammo, and plans/recipes in the suitcases at the train stations for that very same reason. 
---
Plus, I had made 500 caps just making my rounds through Watoga, collecting weapons laying around, mods, and chems. So I wouldn't want to take all your money!
---
Add me, cl88t
---
Get a mule and store everything
---
No idea
---
As far as I’m aware, yes. I don’t think you can find the drink recipes anywhere else in the world
---
Yeah it was just a quad, faster reload, +1 perception so its was kinda crappy, but still stings. Also thnx for the offer, but my character already know most of the mods thnx tho.
---
Definitely, a friend recently came over and had a go at it on my Xbox and he was one that was very against it because of the press. Needless to say 3 hours later he’s convinced and is gonna buy the game. I’m just glad I finally have someone to play with
---

90 seconds solo
---
This is the reason I dont use PA.
---
Fo76 doesn't crash. Must be something you are doing. /s
---
Are they supposed to be put in our camp? I can't find them in my inventory to put them down.
---
There isn't much Bethesda can do to stop people from doing it, but i doubt they're going to facilitate server hoping.  Clearing one area of the map's valuable loot, leaving it empty for anyone else exploring the map, and then hoping to a new server to do it again probably isn't their intended playstyle for the game.
---
Once had a girl in Chico give me a lap dance to the song Fade Into You, I thought it was gonna be awesome but I was wrong.
---
Xo1 can also get carry weight making the excavator pretty useless
---
I was told grenadier doesn’t effect explosive weapons? Is there any confirmation that it improves blast radius for sure?
---
I’m pretty pissed about some of my ancient games that are lost to time. I don’t mind saying F-Xbox at this point. 
---
Anyway, enjoy my [campfire](https://imgur.com/gallery/W4Olc08)

Why do you have to talk your wife into letting you play Fallout? Does she ask your permission to do trivial activities too?
---
I just cut my losses. Lol.
---
Saw Boyz 2 Men live in Vegas, pretty dope show even though it ain’t really my cup o’ tea
---
Hope its still going. Been riding the world full screen for a while.
---
I played a lot at launch, got disheartened, then came back. I’m balancing RDR2 and FO76 and having fun. I’m a filthy casual so your mileage may vary.
---
Isn’t that why loot spawns are character based? Taking a plan on one server bars you from seeing it generate in another.     The whole point of server hopping is retooling the loot till it works.
---
Quad Explosive Double Barrel with reduced vats cost. She's permanently crippled and you deal shit loads of damage.
---
If u end up selling one....ive got 2 extra i can sell u
---
How much? I'll buy right now
---
How much?
---
This Nukashine is for hobo\_greef. You where a true hero.
---
Awesome job, take the gold and go quickly back to work :-)

---
Floor decor, same row as the mini deathclaw statue
---
Don't,'t forget lucky hole mine. If you get radroaches spawning outside (3)you get ALOT in the mine (7-10) Total about 13 or so. Just head down the mine - keep right (don't go through door on left tunnel branch).  If you get glowing ants or rad rats jump servers till roaches spawn.
---
The trading UI is why I got banned. Instead of using the trade UI, I was drop trading all my shit to mules because holy hell trying to "sell" 30 different things to a mule is horrible.
---
It'll be a chocolate deathclaw or something equally lame.
---
It takes a continuas rounds of hopping. Ill get on and find out that my spot is taken and I just move to a differant world.
---
Got anything interesting to trade
---
Some mods can never be learned by scrapping, and others can never be learned at all and you have to buy the loose mod at a vendor. I think the Black Powder Rifle bayonet is like that.
---
To me it makes a difference in the area damage.  I'll have to take videos to see for sure
---
There seem to be a good amount in lewisberg too.   I went there to finally unlock the station for FT, and found 3 in a building by the taxidermists.
---
Looks cozy
---
I love survival. I had a back and forth killing spree with another player. Took it to the next level once I found his base. One of the best nights. No stupid messages, no known bitterness just death and camp destruction.
---
Holy crap how much of you had to drink! Sorry it’s 420 I much have you had to smoke?￼
---
They were more than just bad reviews, the game was practically unplayable and still has a lot of problems, at least for me it does
---
Please. A mirelurk king to perch on my shoulder would be legendary
---
Yeah. My GT is knucklessyrup. Meet up with me
---
I put a beam focuser on my TS gatling laser and it helped soo much keeping the spread down to maximize hits.
---
400 sound fair?
---
could be agility and sneak as well.. is his agility higher? sneak perks? sneak on armor? if they notice you before they notice him youll get alot more attacking you first cause they dont see/hear him.
---
That’s what I’m thinking. I’m trying to figure out what the benefit would be. If it split the beam and each beam did that DpS that would be brutal but if not then what the benefit
---
I want a baby mole miner harvesting my acid when I'm away. That would be awesome.
---
I don't need more weighing my conscious fam

has anyone proved that?

As a 40 something the hottest stripper song of the early and mid 90s was Lives ‘I alone’.  Starts off slow then rocks.   “It’s easier not to be wise.....”
---
Yup! GT is knucklessyrup. Message me
---
You probably don’t want to use an L-ion battery pack in any scenario where you could be taking fire.
---
Then level up before you take a workshop
---
So random question. I'm a level 48 so I will soon hit 50. I've been playing since launch just dont have a lot of time to play. I see your intelligence and luck ranks, after 50 do you stop getting points to allocate towards s.p.e.c.i.a.l. categories or can you keep increasing each category after level 50?
---
Although it would be handy for loot purposes I mainly server hop to find a time of day I enjoy or if I get stuck somewhere weird while using the marsupial mutation. I jump around a lot like a weirdo and sometimes I get stuck in between a trash can and a wall etc...I know I can fast travel in those situations but sometimes I’m over encumbered and it’d be easier to just reload.
---
It would be awesome for uniques like perfect storm... make that puppy lvl 50
---
Oh yes sir mister I sure will because I definitely should be level fucking 400 befor I capture a fucking workshop in the forest where the low levels live
---
This is how I do it too. Vender bot resin and I are bros.
---
Especially with the SBQ, get close enough and you can't miss a single shot
---
It'll go quicker for 500 caps.
---
I've scrapped many more than 20, and I haven't got the plan. But i have found the mod for the large bayonet at Emmett mountain disposal a few times
---
I'd just like to reroll the one good pipe rifle I found, at lvl5. It's not even great, but I still like it.
---
I just picked up the plans for something called “marine helmet” or something.   Thing sells for 25 caps and needs rubber I rarely seem to use. So that basically maxed it out fine.
---
I’d reckon 150 rubber =1.4k with that plan
---
Oh right I know what you are speaking of
---
Wow. What a coincidence. I'm lvl 120ish, had the same desire to check that one of the list. Just finished the queen fight as you were posting this. Good luck.
---
That would go against the continuity
---
And don’t strip me naked either because I want to find another world !
---
The best way I’ve found is a heavy gun like a .50 or a Gatling plasma/laser to knock the engines out then you can shoot it with something else to reduce ammo waste just a tip
---
Shut up and fix my damn tire boy !  ;)
---
Easter deathclaw statue.  It’s big like the moth man, and has big ol bun ears, a basket in its claw, and a very sharp smile.    Maybe it’s pink too
---
That's fair, however, my comment was amazement at already owning and playing a game, then stopping based off of reviews rather than finding bugs and problems that would make you stop playing for a while, but they cleared that up
---
Stopped using that perk.. I seem to not need air underwater in my power armor (glitch?). Plus it PA protects me from water born disease for SOE reason (but I still get rads building up). FO4 you die underwater in power armor without Aquaboy. I collect dirty water from the sulphur fountain in Whitesprings - no rads and I'm there anyway for the disease cure.
---
I have 3rd character but how do I easily and safely transfer items?
---
Hell. No. It's not stealing. You died, there should be negative effects.
---
What's ur psn?
---
I think his stats are so high is just from buffs. You cap out special point at lvl 50.
---
Loads of it at harpers ferry ..
---
^this
---
Happened to me at Whitesprings as well. Tore a dude up Just to have him stop taking dmg next to no life (bloodied .50 cal). While I was shooting him he turns, steps towards me and then blast me down. Worthless PvP glitch
---
Ever since they changed the leaderboard... it went from “Oh god everyone on the server might be hunting me” to “Oh look maybe 3 people are fighting and the rest don’t care.”
---
Might wish to check "black powder" insude whitesprings. Pretty sure they sell mods for all black powder weapons.
---
No one wants it because you get like a billion of those while turning in tech data
---
This is also the reason that DLC locations such as Biv's place, may appear boarded up and the map marker won't appear on initial loading.
---
I've never had the game crash that much.  Shitty internet maybe?
---
Freezing frequency along with blue screens increased dramatically for me after this last patch. Ps4 pro user.
---
Yep, was wanting to put a purchased puncturing mod on a pole hook which requires rank 3 of the perk.  Loaded the card and still wouldn't attach.
---
This is a week old so your a little late here.
---
What time you starting
---
Yeah it's not stealing if you die bro.  Stop dying!
---
It's already in progress
---
I got milk from every single one the first time I tried, and now I've run through three more times and never gotten milk again. So there that...
---
Will send request in 30 min mojo265
---
Fuck yes
---
Ok thanks, I'll check again
---
I just got the fifth one
---
5th
---
5th. If it isn’t there then restart your game.
---
Why are you even on this sub
---
Thank you! I’ve got a few perk points available and wanted to find out before I invest all my points in it!
---
I think I remember that happening with a mole rat before, but I'm pretty sure that was before the damage bug was originally patched
---
I hope I didn't just miss mine.
---
5th.
---
That many crashes isn't true.
---
I prefer chocolate milk to broccoli.
---
Realistically it should only take the same amount of time it takes for things to "settle down" AFTER you load in. Imagine an option from in the game world to load into a different server. It should take like 5-15 seconds instead of 30, and it would guarantee you won't get placed in the same server again
---
Amazing, looks really fun, considering this seriously...
---
Pets would be fine. Just expand the current taming system and let players have a creature or robot follow them around.
---
Animal friend for creature taming, robotics expert for robot hacking.
---
Either make them help in combat or not. Make them essential and go unconscious during a fight and require a stimpak, or make them have way more health than usual but do less damage so they barely ever die but if they do they're gone.
---
But don't add a mini scorch beast queen to the atom shop or as a drop from the queen like we're playing some MMORPG with tiny little pets.
---
yep, i was on both chems.
---
Pulse grenades are awesome.
---
Good news, those are all over the area.
---
If it’s on fire,... don’t stomp it out
---
Furious takes ~10 shots on the same target to reach a 50-60% buff. I dont have exact numbers but both myself and another player did independent testing and got similar results
---
Is this started right now?
---
No but this game isn't like WoW where having tiny little miniatures of creatures in the game following you around as vanity would fit.
---
I want pets as in full size creatures in the game with no "silliness" on it. It just wouldn't fit the game.
---
I think if Bethesda really wants to do a good online game they should send it out to a developer that already has a record of good online games.
---
But I want to be able to name them, and display them in my home :)
---
If somebody didn't kill you they shouldn't even be able to see the bag, it should be instanced to you only. If they kill you then they should be able to take and loot.
---
I don't get to loot a npc if someone else kills it so why should someone be able to loot mine without killing me, it's total BS
---
Hahahaha

I don't know. I've got a scorched blade and a ghoul blade - never leave camp without them!
---
I was on both and it didn't run out &gt;.&gt;
---
I don't want to get dookie in my hat. &lt;scowl&gt;
---
You keep getting perk cards and u can respect one point if u want too after lvl 50.
---
The datamined perk is obviously leftover code from the attack dog perk in Fallout 4.
---
If they're so common why do they sell for thousands a pop? You're thinking of Field Scribe
---
Never seen those either, where are they gotten?
---
Actually they go for 200-300 normally 250. Now that players can sell them to vendors for 450c, there is no incentive to sell to players unless they want to.
---
Serious Sam? Is that you?
---
Not real yet thats from the fallout 76 launch trailer so its prob a scrapped item or a soon to be released item
---
Why'd you have to ask your wife for permission to buy it?
---
How is it not stealing? You are taking something that isn't yours. 
---
I agree there should be negative effects but you taking it should also be negative.
---
You can't just go to a dead persons house and take all their stuff with no repercussion.
---
Hate to break it to you but they are crafted from concrete. Make sure you have lots of Brahmin milk.
---
Yeah they respawn whenever someone new comes in but I dont think alot of people know about it yet
---
I actually never launched a nuke and only did the barrows twice
---
C R O M C H
---
Alright, next time I see a dead person I'm gonna steal there wallet and be like "stop dying bro!".
---
That is very true. I like that idea. If they did no damage to me they do not get to reap the benefits.
---
This is a game about apocalyptic survival. Lmao dude. C'mon. Very different rules and situations.
---
If you’re on XB and need some assistance, send me a PM
---
I've got my default loadout, one for lockpicking, one for terminal hacking, one for selling, and one for around the CAMP that has the crafting perks and whatnot. So glad in-game saving has been restored.
---
Its a mutual respect thing
---
Hey,
---
First of all... how come you play at 60hz with your 2080 Ti? Seems like a waste of a 2080 Ti.  Each to their own though, it just stood out to me :)
---
Anyway, I didn't find any solution unfortunately.  You will have to forgive me, it has been a while since I made threads on here about the problem and I made 2 or 3 each centered around the same problem I believe; but I am not 100% certain which thread had which information. 
---
Anyway, I spent a couple of weeks speaking with Bethesda support.   They had me try loads of things and I even tried my own ideas, none of which worked. 
---
Installing fresh copies of Windows (different builds of Win 10) and only installing the essentials to get the game running (drivers etc) and it still did it.  They asked me to try the CPU affinity thing but it made no impact.  They asked me to download the game again, no different. 
---
In the end I just turned all the FPS counters and frametime graphs that I was using to check when it was going all wonky and tried playing the game.  Once I did that, because I wasn't constantly checking the metrics all the time I found myself not being as bothered by the stuttering and frame drops.  They are still there without a doubt and certain areas of the game are waaaaayyyyy worse, but I can now play it without getting triggered all the time. 
---
My opinion, and I am no game developer, but I know enough about computers and networking and all that good stuff to make a logical guess... is that it is a server issue, probably related to how the game is calculating and pushing out updates for NPC's in the game.  
---
In Watoga, I would be able to stand at a certain point and it would be fine, I would walk 10 feet forward and stop, and then I would start getting frame drops at regular intervals.  I take a step back 10 feet and the problem goes away.  So it would seem there is some sort of radius around something that when you enter it, the server pushes something to you that causes the client to have a frame drop.
---
That being said, I also noticed that when experiencing the frame drops at regular intervals, opening the map would stop them.  
---
I would say with some certainty though that the problems I was having/are having are server side issues rather than my end.  I tried too many things and ruled too many things out.
---
If you have FPS and frametime metrics on your screen all the time and you are checking it constantly, I would disable those and try and just play the game.  As I said, there are still times in the game where I feel the game hitch and stutter, but overall, not concentrating on every little drop in performance made the game much more enjoyable.
---
You of course may be experiecning something totally different and it may be 10 times worse that what I experience/experienced. Guess it's one of those "your mileage may vary" situations.
---
Admitting you preorder is a black mark on reddit. Welcome to the club.
---
Maybe they didnt lie. What was their karma? The last few people ive added have been displaying in main menu or they are offline when they are not. I was in same lobby trading with a person and the game still said they were at main menu. They cant take your caps without you approving the sale. Its free to look at someones inventory only way to scam is lie about you have since we cant inspect the items.
---
This is also a game where you respawn seconds after dying. If it were permanent, I could agree with a free for all for the bag...but it isn't. Now if I go into survival I know what I'm getting into.
---
Do you have copies for sale?
---
Other things to add to the list.
---
\-Armor penetration perks for shotguns since other weapons have them
---
\-Movement speed perks for all weapons because pistols have them
---
\-Damage resistance while firing perks for all weapons, since heavy weapons have it.
---
Or, we could appreciate that different weapons have different build needs. Rifles are generally low strength, and have carry weight issues. Heavy weapons use HEAVY ammo that mandates more perks, or hindering ammo capacity. They also are best optimized for power armor, and non-vats. Pistols have a bad cripple perk, and mediocre weight reduction. I believe they're superior in vats, but I don't have a pistol build to verify that. Then there's the no ammo needs melee builds who can rack up +3-400% bonus damage just by cheesing strength and mutations and such. 
---
Looking at it as a design intent to understand rather than some ridiculous and miraculous oversight (I know, I know, it's Bethesda), it makes perfectly good sense as the shortcoming of rifle builds, complimentary to inherent shortcoming of other weapon families.
---
Pc?
---
my guess the act was to get the price jacked up thinking you were in like a bidding war, friend acting like hes bought buying it trying to get you to shell out tons of caps kinda thing. possibly, but im not up on the whole inv and hack thing since ps4 and i usually ignore random inv and so on
---
Ditch the 1 stars and keep some free space. I stockpiled for player vending and this vendor and really fkd up my storage since they delayed player vending.
---
Keep them is what I’d say but if you start running low on space don’t be afraid to get ride of the one stars or low lvl ones
---
Sure, if someone gives you the drinks.
---
Yeah cuz this video game is exactly like real life right?  If you don't want to lose stuff, don't carry it.  It's not stealing, especially in a game where you can kill each other... You're my enemy, so therefore it's not stealing, it's looting.  Is it stealing when you take loot from dead enemies?  Shit, is it stealing when you STEAL everything out of these dead people's houses?  Their corpses?  You seen really entitled dude!  I'll stop taking junk off dead players, when players stop taking junk and items from dead people in the wasteland.  Jackass...
---
Thx both of ya
---
You remind me of the people whining for Sekiro to have "easy mode". It's a necessary mechanic.
---
lord knows if Bethesda will actually get it up and running 
---
what platform? I'd be interested in possibly buying some from you. I'm on PS4
---
I guess I’m more wondering if they can all be found at least once in world
---
Can you respec one point each level after level 50?
---
Same but I don't have many good ones
---
Right but say we figured out the amount of power needed, like in watts... if it were something like only 3Kw, that'd be pretty manageable. I mean yeah, a consumer 3Kw "put-put" generator is heavy. But you could make it lighter. You could make your mech suit out of carbon fiber, and put a weight limit on the operators.
---
Would a pneumatic air compressor be more or less efficient than electric motors?
---
Yes
---
Just keep looking, usually pops up randomly for me.  There's I think 3-4 different spots, just keep checking.  Or ask on the lfg for what you need.
---
Insects - Forest (anywhere)
---
Mirelurks - Toxic Valley (anywhere)
---
Canines - Flatwoods by the river bridge (Forest)
---
This is lovely! I want to do something like this now! Lol
---
Other thing for some reason most of my equipped legendarys are bloodied and I don't even use that build
---
Word, thanks for the heads-up! Would hate to short change any dwellers and get left in a ditch somewhere.
---
Insects - Fireflys count so you can do that event at the lighthouse.
---
Mirelurks - North of the map in the water at grafton there is tonnes of them, there is also an event up there that spawns them.
---
Canines - flatwoods, house beside 76. Around the ferris wheel, fairground area. There is a wolf event also.
---
I hope it isn't like this, 50 or 100 tokens per roll would be silly imo
---
Every time I control more than two power plants, or control most the work shops.  I used to love doing the power plants, note I refuse, cuz every single time I've gotten all three, the game has crashed.
---
I like it, but it’s very grindy
---
It affects all mods if you have the boxed versions, but not if you’ve learned the plan.
---
This is why I like my bloodied ripper
---
I've never seen any of the mixed drinks or new beers out in the world.
---
Did u own a "settlement" cuz apparently u can be killed if so
---
Yea I never knew about the in game multiplayer menu that I guess was made so people could team up but is mostly used for trading So there’s no karma unfortunately. And I’m not up to the whole hacking thing either tbh. But I’ve never seen 1 person with either of those masks and have only even heard of a few people having them so how would someone have 2!? That would be crazy!!
---
No not yet it may have to be postponed to tomorrow as my internet is giving me problems
---
A workshop? I did but I wasn't anywhere near it. They can just kill you anywhere?
---
Are you still selling one?
---
From what I've heard yea
---
I want bars, I’ve been collecting food, booze, and chems for weeks now in anticipation, I turned a bus into a makeshift brewery.
---
Alright well thanks for telling me, I'm definitely not gonna own any for a while.
---
Collection / Ingredient Run
---
Green thumb, woodchuck, hunter's bounty, super duper, chemist, pharma farma, cap collector, scrapper, pack rat, etc
---
Well I tried to join his game immediately and it wouldn’t give me the option. I mean those are the rarest items in the game. Like I said to the other person, I’ve only heard of a few people across all platforms that had one of the masks not to mention both! So I feel like they wanted to get someone’s attention. Idk I just wasn’t sure if anyone else had came across anything like this or knew what the deal was. Strange none the less!
---
Have you become Mayor of Watoga? You get an All Rise from that quest
---
You're a hero.
---
Oh shit. Ok then I’m going to try to join tomorrow for sure!!!
---
That would be amazing 😁
---
My dearest apologies
---
I hope it fixes it for you. It didn’t make me uncrashable but it lowered the amount of crashes dramatically. Let me know how it works for you. If it works, it might be worth bringing it up to Bethesda’s team and maybe they can change how they patch things so we don’t have to wait 2 hours for the game to download.
---
Yes and yes.  Both thoughts I have had during the game too.
---
Nah, I got it for Xbox so that I could enjoy our new lovesac
---
If theyre 3 stars, explosive or have faster swing speed sell them on the market.
---
I’ve never made those.  Thanks for the heads up!
---
I don't know how it started but there was a lot of mixing and some powders of some sort it's all blurry, but I still think this is an effective strategy I've thought this through, I think it's gonna work, I'm confident in my douche abilities it's great
---
They literally warn you when taking it that other players can engage in PvP.
---
no ..no one is buying those for thousands
---
Yes but I thought it was only within the bounds of the workshop, all my time playing this has never happened to me lol
---
Yeah it is like real life...every time I die all my junk appears in a small paper bag.
---
This, and I also promised her I would beat more of my other games that I have sitting around.
---
Workforce’s aren’t fluid like that. Steering a company is like steering an oil tanker, not a jet ski man.
---
I’m as big of a critic of BGS as their is after this clusterfuck of a game - but I really can’t blame them for not firing their art department to spin up some more coders, get them familiar with the engine, etc... so maybe in 6 months it has a yield.
---
Even bringing in contractors to beef up is hard when using a proprietary engine. 
---
I’ld Love to believe they pulled in people from the new ES and Starfield to clean up this mess, but we all know they’re not.
---
That wouldn't work very well. Take a workshop, run off in invincible passive mode.
---
Fair enough but if you aren't there they could take the workshop and you'd have to come back if you wanted to defend it, no matter I just didn't realize that was a thing and I'm
---
Just gonna avoid workshops from now on until I get better guns lol
---
I hope to Godd I'm wrong but I think Nuclear Winter is gonna be battle royale.
---
Lfg on Xbox? And thanks for clearing up that there’s more than one spot for me
---
Like you say, it's mostly a sentimental thing.  My Lv. 10 Bolstering Metal Chest Piece is nothing compared to what I have now, but that thing lasted me for a good 30-40 levels and still lives in my stash.
---
I will indefinitely after I take what I want cuz my legendary suck
---
This is probably a dumb question, but why is the pump action shotgun so valuable?
---
Whitesprings, if you really want to cheese it up, you can stand outside of the bay windows and the ghouls cannot attack you, but you can shoot through just fine.
---
It's not that it's so valuable, it's that it can be a very difficult plan to find
---
The game is glitchy still but as a lvl 125 I find great joy in helping the new people :)
---
ok...
---
Well the majority of players will just let you keep it peacefully and won't engage but some people are just greifing or trying to farm you for caps
---
It wouldn't work because you could avoid the zone and be invincible to PvP out of it. Take two steps back, boom, tank a mini nuke, hop back in and engage again.
---
This has happened to me few times recently! I will be chilling while the fusion cores are brewing and some sick weed will claim the work shop and sneak shot me. The bad part is when I return fire it doesn’t do anything because I have pacifist mode on! So they can kill me but I can’t do shit! The last guy stored my fusion generator and crafting tables and left the server! Like what? Are you taking those with you asshole? Lol. They will literally fast travel across the map and pay 40 caps to claim the workshop just to have a little fight. And other dude is right, they can’t contend in survival so they prey on the people that obviously don’t like to pvp! I’m level 130 btw but I just don’t like pvp, I don’t see a need for it in adventure.
---
One suggestion or place I would slightly disagree is with using a Discord channel for trading. I’ve tried looking at them and it’s a freak show. No details, no history of comments, very vague titles. Maybe I just don’t know how to use it.
---
I suggest using /r/Market76, or less so, /r/fo76bazaar
---
Ah true
---
No worries I was hopping off for the night so it works out good. I’m getting a headache from staring at that screen for 8 hours! Lol
---
Previous ones have been showing up in camp section of the atom shop. Not sure if that is because I already have them, but they were listed there.
---
Hey I’m a way it works out for me too The Godfather is on tv
---
Sorry, I was doing something. Do you have any flux to offer? 😃
---
I have 760 hours played. Today I have ran into more toxic people then I have the rest of my time playing.  I hope this isnt the start of something.
---
I think the trick is to try to get on top of the cabin and hope that, in the process of doing so, some other player draws her ire.  But when I do the event, I kit myself out in Action Girl and Marathoner, because I expect to run like crazy.  And I give myself Field Surgeon too, because I need my healing to outpace the constant damage from the pylons and the numerous Colonel Gutsys, let alone the Imposter's obnoxious laser.
---
Adds a challenge Get a friend to find your eggs. 10 atoms.........suprise
---
i have 5 pieces of -20% chems and food. Overencumbered even in excavator with shocks
---
It's the best thing to go with those fancy Faschnacht Berets. Throw on some sunglasses and woooow
---
Oh shit, yea that’s one of the small things that could over ride FO76 time! That and game of thrones lol
---
I was avoiding claiming workshops for that reason, but I figured out a kind of work around.
---
I've started going ahead and claiming unowned workshops, then once I have the rewards for claiming it I server hop and am workshop-claim free again. No worries about PvP when I wander off after
---
Unfortunately too many items in a stash puts strain on a server.  If you raise the stash space, you lower server stability.  It sucks having to choose after fallout 4 saving EVERYTHING...but it is what it is.  Beth says too many items in stash cause server issues.
---
I would strongly suggest you don't trade items like that. I've heard multiple people say their servers crashed at the worst possible time and they lost weapons, armor, power armor, you name it. Unlikely but safer to just trade with said friend.
---
I had no idea Fireproof negated explosive damage! Finally I can stop blowing myself up.
---
Update: 
---
Logging out and logging back in did not fix it.
---
Removing clothing did not fix it.
---
Upon closer inspection, my skeleton is outside my body.
---
Now testing to see if dying will resolve it as others have suggested.
---
Joining in!
---
I just got a level 50 quad assault rifle. Only one star.
---
I play Fallout 76 daily for hours when I'm not at work it's fallout 76 eat sleep and yeah you get the gist 😆 fallout 76 is LIFE
---
Me too. I really was thinking people that want to do that type of shit would stay in survival! It separates outlets priorities pretty well I think. That and fix the fact that pacifist should turn off at work shops!!! People are just so weird dude it’s like if you want fusion cores or junk or whatever, you can have it! I’ll gladly share it! There is no need to spend a bunch of caps to kill one person. It’s pretty lame if you ask me.
---
Yeah that'll probably be what I do from
---
Now on, I just claimed red rocket for the challenge
---
You had to ask your wife, hahahaha. So glad Im not married, I answer to no one.
---
Thanks man for all the suggestions. Love this community!
---
Yeah do a looking for group and ask for whatchu need bro
---
My bad thought you were saying I was asking on removing bags from survival mode and now see you stated to ask for a 3rd mode and thats not an option since I doubt Fallout 76 team has resources to do so and outside of pvp what purpose does making me drop my junk to help make this game better? It failed to make death important and makes me think twice in playing in an area with other players I don't know, I would rather request they destroy random junk in my inventory then drop it so I can come back and get it back. I'm not asking to make adventure mode easy but I don't want Fallout 76 to give incentives to promote negative behaviors because Bethesda couldn't be bothered to create real content, heck I've seen few times players going to sheepsquash event to farm bag drops from players and theres no way for me to force that player to give it back, I wouldn't mind if they added an option to contest it like if I die and someone grabs it I have option to force them to pvp and if they run away by leaving server they forfeit my junk.
---
If ppl would use their mic more trades would be easier
---
Not to mention everyone wearing imposter outfits that look exactly like the bot!!!
---
And if you even mention your options on it people turn around and say your just a bitch or salty. I dont mind pvp once in a while but 212 vs 24 isnt pvp. Workshops are pvp areas but when they only use them to freely kill you just for the sake of killing you with no gain what so ever its obvious they are only doing it to be dicks. I fear that if this keeps up it will discourage new players and in the long run hurt the game more.
---
That is the greatest wife 😊
---
Do mean resistance values like these?

Wouldn't be too bad actually with this kind of setting, but it's bethesda making it so yeah.
---
Apex Legends showed that Battle Royales can be really fun.
---
I saw a guy build his camp next to the event, half way down the hill. He put up a shit load of middle turrets and laser turrets and it really worked. The sheepsquatch got pissed and turned his attention to the camp. While he tried to take out the turrets we just hammered down on him and we probably killed him in half the time as usual. Good idea!
---
You can give up your workshop by logging out or server hopping. 
---
I figured out I could do that right after receiving the Claim A Workshop quest rewards, and not need to worry about PVP after I go on my merry way
---
:(
---
I miss Human NPCs.
---
Heard a rumor that crouching takes your leaderboard flag off the map. Can anyone confirm?
---
I just got ganked at a workshop too. They’re so broken. The aggressor totally controls when pvp will begin and there’s nothing you can do (except run) until he initiates and then shoots you dead half a second later. 
---
If contesting workshops is really about the workshop, then we need to stop losing caps from this dynamic. No caps lost in a contested workshop. That way someone will actually want it if they fight or not bother. 
---
There’s also no point building in them because they get cleared every server. We should be able to keep our last build or start fresh. Otherwise these areas are pointless.
---
Xbox
---
World full
---
Depends. Do you have any flux, or caps? I'm fair as long as I know what you'll give first 😄
---
Also on xbox
---
Happens at WS occasionally just server hop.
---
Yea I stay away from them on my alt. He’s only level 15 and he is super easy pickings!!! Yea anyone under level 50 cannot do anything to someone 200+! Yea I did go back and killed the guy a couple times while it was still claiming :p He had to get his friends to come save him the third time he seemed revenge. Lol
---
Okay Vampire War Drum is two star. Two effects. It just changed which one effect was displayed on the main inventory screen. Thank you for teaching me more avout legendaries lol.

Technically data mined recently shows they added a perk for a canine companion to have bonus damage so we might get companions soon, but of coarse thats companions not vanity pets. But still might have cosmetics to pay for new breds and etc.
---
If you have any flux or caps, tell me what you're willing to give 😄
---
I just use the defense missions for exp I dont care about the workshops for anything else
---
Yeah no clue what it is worth, but I'll pay for both AND add any flux i have.
---
I rather have them fix mods first.
---
I've done and there where still there. I was hoping they changed (done a lot this dungeon for get xp and never happened and at WS too)
---
As I said, the mod is for Fallout 4 and I do own that game. I already released it on [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/38089) and [Bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net/en/mods/fallout4?author_username=DankRafft&amp;number_results=20&amp;order=desc&amp;page=1&amp;product=fallout4) but I want to create an expansion which adds some of the new effects present in FO76 to FO4.
---
Yeah dude, if you wanna make a quick few hundred, go to Billings with green thumb, grab ALL the corn and ALL the razor grain, grab the mothman eggs and turn all that in.  I just made like 600. Literally right now.  There was 204 razor grain, and like 136 corn, sells for 1c each, and I got I think 28 mothman omelettes @ I think 8-9 a piece with the bargaining perk and grape tats.  You could also make a corn, grain, black berry, carrots, melons etc at your base, and use green thumb to gain and sell all that for 1c each.  Hope that helps!  And if not, go to a place heavy in either mutants or scortched, and take all weapons and sell them lol!
---
Yea I’m going to have to find a way to get some more XP on my little guy.
---
Wish I could find anyone wanting to run it, use to be everyone on server went and now no one runs events unless its a daily.
---
I believe it's a bug related to nukes. Eyebots or liberators or protectron guardians will spawn instead of the regular mobs right after a nuke if the game can't properly adjust the mobs back to what they are supposed to be from their glowing variants
---
Exactly what I was looking for, thank you so much!
---
There should be a timer. Most of the time players will have a team mate fast travel to you. They'll engage PvP and thier buddy one-shots you before you know what's going on. This is currently within the rule set so I'm ok with it but a change would be nice.
---
I'd love to see an abandon workshop option or a go defend your workshop prompt with PvP only at said workshop.
---
GT is knucklessyrup. Message me
---
Yeah, honestly. Can’t get metal armor either.
---
I love the pipe rifles because I feel like the whole "gun made out of spare parts" thing is what post apocalypse is about, I just wish I could upgrade their ammo or receiver to be on par with other guns...or find a legendary one.
---
Yeah same. I just want to know what's so fun about one hit killing someone so much weaker. It's like how it isnt fun fighting level 1 scorched after to get high enough in level
---
I have had it happen to me multiple times with an automatic tesla gun when chaining to multiple enemies, and others have said it happened with a tesla to them too. I use an explosive (nocturnal) gatling plasma quite a lot though and never have any issues with that. 
---
But when you say "The health of anything level 60ish, the health jumps back up, resulting to having to use twice as much ammo to kill it.", do they actually die after you hit them again? That sounds different from the damage bug, it might potentially even be lag related
---
its risky yes! but its an option. Definitely use with caution. Safer option would be to give it to your friend like you said. But a friend who is willing to help you out is not always available. Another method is to have two bethesda accounts, buy two games, and sign them in at the same time on your computer. This is more expensive but lots of people do this.
---
Currently the burrows is a hot spot for nukes this "bug" usually happens when a nuke zone is clearing. You could've easily got another nuked server.
---
I'd love an abandon option too. I'm high level and the caps I lose on death are insane. I just don't even take workshops anymore because there's still so many plans and recipes I need.
---
I recently made a “heavyweight” loadout with all of the weight reductions at full power, it lets you get out of places.
---
Hang in there until backpacks are released.
---
My god I can’t wait till this issue has been resolved.
---
Yeah, it's an exploit. They can challenge your settlement and immediately stop. This triggers the pvp aspect of contesting your workshop, but you're obviously not engaging them, which just gives them unlimited reign to do what they please
---
Awesome, amazing. 
---
I’m planning the same with Massachusetts and Fo4
---
*WHOS IDEA WAS THIS*
---
You had to talk your wife into letting you get a game? Is this a uhh.. normal occurrence?
---
Thank you for this. Sheepsquatch and queen both dead within 20 mins
---
I suppose it could be lag even though up getting 68 up and 92 down. To me it feels like the server is trying to keep up with calculations. They don’t randomly die, nor does the health go where it should. It just goes back up as if the previous shot was considered a trial shot and the second is a verification shot. It only happens to me on auto rifles with explosive damage or my tse gauss. My tse lever that I sold did it to me but I stopped using it.
---
I'm not going to lie, but it's 4AM for me right now and I'm in bed, if you're up for it later on I don't mind.
---
GT as in gamer tag? 😕
---
Word, preaching to the choir It seems cheaper to just buy the plans than to mess with a work shop. I'm not built for PvP and I'm not super good at it I'm ok but not great...... well TBH I lose more than I win so maybe I do suck at it lol
---
I don't normally coment on peoples picture projects and such I normally coment on help and answers topics  but holy crap man good work on these pics some of them i had to look twice to figure out which one was which lol
---
It was definitely a blast!  I would love to see your Massachusetts pics when they're done!
---
In the past it was much riskier. The servers seem to be more stable than they used to. I've done this with friends and even just using random GTs to join off probably 50-75 times and haven't had a single issue in probably a month and a half. Your method is definitely safer but depending on what you're moving it can get tedious. Props to BGS i guess for allowing me to somewhat reliably let me move things between characters :/ With that said I have friends who try to do it on unstable servers and lost a ton of stuff. Just check to make sure there's no nukes or a ton of activity on the server. These tend to be safest.
---
If they're not headed to the atom shop, put plans for the Cappy/Nuka statues and such down there as a reward at the end
---
Will do.
---
Did this event today and all 30 were empty still. Feelsbad Bethesda.
---
Nah.
---
I've done the event at least 20 times, never succeded. Maybe it's because I'm gaming mornings but I noticed I'm usually top 3 highest ranking player at the event and I'm only lvl 67.
---
I can get on tomorrow then. 😁
---
I did something similar when I first moved to Vegas a few years ago for New Vegas, but this is much better.
---
.....ok
---
Yes papi.
---
It would be really weird if you were on a PlayStation.
---
idk then. The only tse I have is a dragon, and I rarely use that. It pretty much always one shots though, and I don't experience that issue
---
I put all mine on an alt and kept what I use on my character
---
Nicely done.
---
If you take a workshop you're open to PvP, no bug or exploit.
---
“Several” is essentially another way of saying a “couple or few.” How many times did you did the Fasnacht? Because if you did it less than 5 times of course you didn’t get it all the masks. Most people did it more than 20 times per Reddit sampling.
---
I'll trade you my berserker's tire iron.... if the servers don't continue to crash every 20-30 minutes ...
---
Thanks!!
---
Ad victoriam!
---
I didnt know this! Going to check it out tonight! Oh wait. I dont have any pistol perks. Fuck.
---
Can you share the link? Would love to see them!
---
Save the ones with more than one star or that have low weight and sell the rest. Like everyone else, I blew up my stash hoarding them initially. 
---
I now just vendor all my one stars.
---
Finally! TYVM
---
"show me"
---
You're very welcome, the credit goes to skscalf though
---
Same happened to me. I got all the way up till making the Nukashine, but then the quest disappeared after I disconnected.
---
Here here. Contesting workshops should be about the workshop. No caps lost on death. They whole contesting mechanic is deeply flawed. As soon as you own one, you’re an extremely vulnerable mark.
---
I'd have to hunt them down; I never uploaded them anywhere at the time and my phone went swimming last July. Though I have an old backup I've never fully checked to see when it was I last backed up my photos. I'll see what I can dig up.
---
It's an exploit if you're on the other side of the map and your death will contribute nothing to the workshop being taken
---
I just scrolled past it tbh
---
Thank you both! 
---
Now, how to +karma two people in one post ...
---
Right, but it would be nice to not have to do that if you're already busy doing things on that server. Really, just being able to hand it over to someone is the biggest thing for me.
---
(yes - Peek at the information on the imgur post )
---
Were you able to actually find the plan?
---
Its a rewarding project for sure
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_actuator
---
Not sure what's the best, there is a table on that page that describes the pros and cons of various types of linear actuators.
---
No, it was designed to make you open to PvP.
---
“Don’t mention the war...” ;)
---
I just hope one miss doesn't sabotage the whole thing like a makeup day should be involved.
---
You should!
---
Never had it crash at loading screen but crash after a ciuple hours a gameplay a lot
---
Ouch. What a story, real or not.
---
found the manly man who thinks men who aint manly are weak. someone has insecurity issues.
---
As far as I can tell from the ESM, Core Assembly has the same effect as a single Kinetic Servo, and five times less effect than a single AP regen legendary armor piece. So not much. Implausibly low, if anything.
---
I can't tell you anything about Kinetic Dynamo except that it has a factor of 0.2 in there. Best to test and see if the AP jumps up when you get hit.
---
2nd account. Extra characters dont help unless you have friends to help you mule
---
Uninstalling and reinstalling has seemed to work, I will put in a ticket with Bethesda to bring their attention to this
---
lol wow. relationships should always discuss spending habits. thats a healthy relationship.
---
What a conundrum.... Trust a raider for better connectivity..... Or continue to dc
---
found the mgtow dude.
---
Excavator has a built-in carry weight increase of 100 AND can have calibrated shocks. Not to mention mining four ore per click, which is great for lead and steel collecting.
---
Everyone who has a problem with trading is doing sketchy shit. No offense.
---
wow you people are horrible hope you never get into a relationship people like you are abusive.
---
I'm getting ready to quit myself. Not enough content. It was fun but I find myself really bored lately doing the same grind.
---
I need more info on the "Fireproof 2" thingy. I have Fireproof 3 but i keep getting OS if i shoot my explosive shotgun. Is Fireproof 2 bugged or somthing to negate the damage ?
---
That was good
---
Wow, I had no idea it was so milquetoast of an effect. That really is pretty shocking. Super helpful to know, though!
---
I've had them crawl though the window and attack me before.
---
ty!
---
I'm running that same setup with a AMD cpu instead and getting crashes. Although lately I've been getting less, so I wonder if there was some server maint. done that's resolved some of the issues.
---
Imagine not using nukes to kill the big bad though.
---
They usually go for the higher level player
---
I'm sorry for your personal troubles, but I still think you cheated. Maybe you didn't, but of course everyone who did claims they're innocent. Given the sheer amount of false claims made on this sub like the fake trade stealing glitch I just treat anyone who was banned with major skepticism. I hope things get better for you.
---
There is seldom so special a relationship one can have as the one between grandparents and their grandchildren. Grandparents can provide unique perspectives on the world that not even one's parents and aunts/uncles have. 
---
Losing all four of mine as a young adult was excruciating. You have my deepest sympathies for the loss of your beloved grandmother. 
---
Remember her well. Be assured that she is forever a part of you. She won't want you to give up on the life she so clearly encouraged to strive for happiness.
---
I don’t think there is, but for me because I’m on ps4 I’ll use the remote play app and just start up the game and check the shop from my tablet
---
That's a solid approach I've started sticking to myself. Keeps my tiny 500gig HD a bit happier.
---
Love it man, I wanted to do something similar to this
---
Always glad to see another mountaineer on this sub, great pictures
---
They just failed everywhere else because of their own idiotic beliefs and utter stupidity.
---
beam slitter is just as bad in 76 as it was in 4. Don't bother.
---
Nice to see Bethesda kept things a lot more realistic compared to previous games.
---
I'd be willing to accept load zones for different areas or just much higher GB games to get one this large every time.
---
Clearing the bunker is NV reminded me if the Burrows too. Easy af and underground.
---
?? Watoga EMS still is a consistent legendary spawn, what are you talking about? It sometimes even spawns three legendary muties all at once. Watoga streets have been nerfed to death, though.
---
Oh cool ill check it out. Would still be cool if they actually just could be stacked without having to do some weird building trick. Thank you for the tip! :)
---
Ok but I can walk around by myself and kill 13 scorchbeast in an hour. So can most other players.
---
Been playing server disco fever for the past week or so, hitting its stride throughout the day today at 6+ random dances. I gave up for the day shortly before hopping onto reddit.
---
Sorry It's midnight where I live 😅
---
Become more well rounded, sounds like you are escaping from reality instead of dealing with your issues head on. Putting that much time into a game isn't healthy.
---
Fuuuuuuuuuuck that sucks
---
Thanks you so much. When i rebuild my camp next I'm definitely doing that.
---
Good to know. Thanks!
---
Did you find the plan though?
---
I had trouble talking my wife into the divorce too :D
---
I believe i lost an x01 left arm that was attached to a frame.
---
That's the capital wasteland BoS too bud. And they took out the remnant of the high tech US govt. So Appalachia BoS is just weak.
---
You seen overencubered in real life.
---
i have to remove ghoulish from my build. just in case
---
I don't pick a side. All factions are worthless under the light of the Moth.
---
I once came back to my camp completely destroyed and the two guys there told me someone had paid them 2k caps to do it, but if I paid more they would stop. *You already destroyed everything you fucking idiots.* It wasn't a WS turret base and all I do is help noobs so fat chance. Some people just think everyone is as stupid as they are.
---
Not that rare. I get one consistently every 10th time at Camp Venture, so that's what they are worth: ten TD. ;-)
---
Same thought.
---
I can never get that damn pickle jar open. Thank you scribe.
---
i have a feeling it will :(
---
Character videos?
---
There is a lot of cobalt flux if you nuke Morgantown
---
Worlds full lol. Good luck
---
some guys at r/market76 will sell it for 150
---
It's even better when people ignore the on screen instructions to activate the pylons, won't revive you when you go down, use their cannibal perk to actually finish you off when you go down (rather than stimpak you), then steal your meager loot bag after the event fails. The loot bag you deliberately left alone during the event because you were trying to beat the event.
---
Ah, fun times, 76.
---
Yes. YouTube search Fudgemuppet. They made character build videos. How to build, what to use, the armour, the weapons so on.
---
Yeah, it's a busted up Easter bunny mask. Not a big deal, I like the eggs more.
---
it’s a daily quest called ecological balance and it triggers automatically for me at least once a day
---
Derp on me with not answering the actual question. 
---
I found your lovely tip after the last server disco fever I was willing to endure today. 
---
I will begin the quest anew starting tomorrow night sometime after grilling and beer to celebrate Easter Sunday.
---
I agree.
---
I'd rather they were regenerating deathclaw egg food items than a mask ...
---
Awesome!  Definitely let us know when you find it.  Because you will. 😁
---
feels bad man :( im hoping some level 7 will hop off but im guessing not
---
Pipe pistols can be modded to be full auto as well.
---
So buy the game again? Seems like there should be a better solution.
---
If you mean create a 2nd account on Bethesd net, I wouldn't think they would allow you to link it to the same copy of the game.
---
Oh, those. 
---
I liked most the one I saw mapping out the Silver Shroud by \~50th level. That was well done.
---
I do a loop through Camden Park cuz I'm already there painstakingly working my way towards the psychotic cat costume. Vendor is right there although sometimes requires server hopping
---
Awesome!
---
There is a new one. Close and check again
---
Have to fully quit out and restart the application, thwn it should show up.
---
No worries. I've got it three times tonight. Have to make more ammo eventually
---
Close game &amp; try again
---
&gt;- When making chems or ammo apply the Ammosmith 2 (80% more ammo) / Chemist (double quantity) along with Super Duper 3 (30% chance to double whatever you make). Instead of making 10 ammo you have chance to make 36 with same material!
---
Incorrect. Super Duper doubles the BASE quantity, not the modified quantity. Example: I make 5mm ammo. Base is 100, Ammosmith ups it to 180. If Super Duper procs, I get 280 (180+100), not 360. Same with Chemist; if Super Duper procs when making stimpaks, I get 3 (2+1), not 4.
---
It's still a ridiculously great perk, but it's not completely bananas.
---
Walk the freedom trail
---
The world's smallest erection?
---
Heard this. Played about 800 hours. Haven't lost anything. Unfortunately with all the BS that gets claimed on here I'll wait to see some video of this happening.
---
How did people react to your choice of... Headwear.
---
My wife and I solve this by having separate accounts. Mutual bill money goes into a joint account, and we have our own separate accounts for spending money. Done, no babysitting of the others finances required.
---
I have two Hunter Longcoats, will gladly sell one for 4000 caps. PS4. Price is like that because it simply took an awfully long time to get the second one. ;-)
---
This is  an issue and my way to solve it was to paint everything so it can't disapear been working fibe so far. But ur saying it disapeared anyway even if its painted. Ugh that's not good. Bethesda needs to get on it. People put so many hours into a build that one peice missing can ruin the build. Fix asasp plz
---
I will. The pump action shotgun is one of my favorite weapons in-game. There's something viscerally satisfying with each chi-clack after each semi-deafening blast. 
---
Boom shaka-lakka, baby!
---
hmu if you do it sometime tomorrow
---
This is impressive. Looks like you really enjoy fallout.
---
GT is SteelBiscuit174
---
It's a bit hard to get a video of it happening, unless you happen to record every minute you play.
---
Just look at the common weapon class perks (pistols, rifles, shotguns, melee, heavies) and try to find the elements each is missing. Pistols are reload speed, shotguns are missing armor penetration, melee has no stagger perk, etc. The weapon classes are meant to be done in such a way there are asymmetries. You just need to find other ways to cut weight, like carry less rifles, use legendary armor, legendary weapons with reduced weight, reduced weight perks you might not take normally (IE sturdy frame), armor mods like deep pockets, etc.
---
The only one that's really disadvantaged that needs more attention IMO is pistols. Gun runner is useless because of speed demon, there's too few guerilla (auto) class pistols in comparison to other weapon classes, the best gunslinger pistol (the salvaged assualtron pistol) still suffers from the damage bug, and it's generally only viable to use pistol perks if you're running some sort of bug (like double dipping pistol and rifle perks on some types of rifle/pistol weapons).
---
\#BabyDeathclawHereWeCome
---
Same boat here, I'm a massive hoarder and have 36 weapons on me. I have not yet lost anything. Gonna have to treat this like the "trade stealing" fiasco until I see one single shred of proof behind all the stories
---
They could of made the game you lose inventory junk at death.   Now at least there’s a chance you may get it back.   Duh.
---
No problem!
---
Yeah all the lost pieces, me and my friends, the power armor went missing while we were wearing them.
---
Need more upvotes
---
actually no you are incorrect here. pipe pistols also are considered rifles when you add a stock as are laser guns, plasma guns, enclave plasma gun, and ultracite laser gun. ALL of these guns get bonus damage from both perks if given a grip.
---

Thanks for clarifying. Ill change that

Not really, I'm on PS4 and I just hit a button to record the last 15 minutes. All you'd need to do is have looked in your pipboy sometime before it disappeared.
---
yes, it was even painted. it's pretty disappointing. I would be even more upset if it was a legendary piece that can't be recrafted. 
---
(and I should not have to recraft my power armor because it bugs out and disappears.)
---
this bug makes me want to stop playing.
---
Awww. There is that quote which goes around Facebook periodically which is something along the lines of " Before you diagnose yourself with depression or low self-esteem, first make sure you are not surrounded by idiots." An overgeneralization, of course, as most things in life are more complex than heroes &amp; villains. But I've experienced the extent to which the environment that you happen to be in can result in feeling completely ostracized or completely adored while still being the exact same person. If the people around you are not willing or able to provide the support that you need, are there any local gamer groups you could meet up with? Some people would love to have a Fallout expert hang out and mentor them &amp; feed them tasty snacks / beverages...
---
You're not kidding about the realism. Prior to this, I'd never been to The Greenbrier Hotel before, but having spent so much time in Whitesprings I knew exactly how to find my way around the resort...so much so that I was giving other people directions on how to get to the main entrance. It was the most surreal experience of my life.  haha
---
Flooded train yard near Watoga. I've found that one twice there.
---
If there’s no chance for loss why even remove from inventory.   It’s a consequence of death.
---
this is not true. see my comment here

Yeah i got stop  so i wouldn't have even been able to
---
About 90% of all current legendary drops are 1\* and shitty, no matter if you use Burrows or Whitesprings.
---
Yesterday got 9 Legendary items from single pass and 8 were 1\* and 1 was 3\*
---
I have a few Fallout Funkos of various types and sizes. Including a bobble head vault boy.
---
It's a pretty great deal at $4 but it's the only style of Funko I don't like. 
---
Good snag though.
---
You're not kidding!  We actually took a day off from driving/photos because we just couldn't stand the thought of being in that car another moment.
---
Lmao! I haven’t heard that one yet! What a bunch of dick weeds! Were they wanted then!? Or did you just leave the server!?
---
That's so cool, that was some really good photography
---
 Montani Semper Liberi !
---
Awesome!  Any more help we can get up on this post is great.
---
They were, I just left. What a couple of tools. I'm embarrassed to be on the same platform.
---
If that's true.. Take care of yourself. Most of us can relate and know how hard it can be to lose someone. I would let it go. They obviously found something and that's it. It maybe the drop trading or whatever.
---
I remember when I lost everything in runescape. Some guy figured out the pass to my account. I logged in and was naked in lumbridge, everything on my character was gone including my blue phat, disc, easter eggs (all legit farmed or bought in game). I reached out to support but they didn't give a shet. They reinstated the email to my account and that was it. I haven't logged in or thought about the game since. Well I did do a rough estimate, it was around 2.5k cash lost if each item was sold for real money. Nothing traded in this game has that one of a kind value except maybe the faschnaught masks, and even those maybe farmed every year.
---
My latest annoying griefer decided to murder me while I was in the middle of building a bunch of stuff at a workshop. If I enjoyed murdering random lower level players, I'd at least wait until they were done building everything before taking them out :P  
---
I think in theory survival mode was supposed to lure these players elsewhere... but I'd assume they might already be bored of it by now ;)
---
I added you
---
Very interesting. Thanks for sharing. Presumably that means this was intentional and not a bug.
---
I’ll take a pic next time I’m there.
---
+karma
---
Alright, so lets start with the basic line.
---
Raider -&gt; T-45 -&gt;T60
---
All three have the same basic statistics, good damage resist, mediocre rad and energy resist, with each being incrementally better, they all share the trait of being cheap as dirt to repair. The difference is that they are available at different levels. 15 - 25 - 35 respectively. Noob friendly, and low maintenance.
---
Next you have the big three
---
T-51 - X0-1 -U
---
 These are the top tier armors that each are best in their environment, T-51 is the best combat armor there is, best ballistic and energy protection, but weak rad resistance meaning it is less preferably in nuke zones. X0-1 by contrast has top end radiation and energy resistance, making it ideal for nuke zones. Ultracite is a hybrid armor, it has top end damage resistance, and good radiation resistance, meaning it is a great hybrid that has ideal stats for doing everything without having to change around. 
---
And lastly excavator
---
Excavator is the ultimate utility armor, having trash resistances across the board, but comes with an innate set bonus of 100 carry weight, and the arms combined give 4 times ore yield. Making it useful and utilitarian.
---
All four of these armors share the cost of being the most difficult and resource intensive to repair, Ultracite and X0-1 also share the downside of being incredibly difficult to upgrade, with no consistent source for plans you might be looking for. 
---
Finally T-45/51/60 have the problem of being only available randomly in the world (rose gives a full raider set as a quest reward), and along with raider are not easily craftable, meaning to get the best possible suits of them you need to hunt random world spawns, or farm treasure maps for the plans, which can be extremely time consuming.
---
Play it with the sidechick
---
I should probably do the same.  We'll get them in the post once we have em.
---
I still take dmg as well. Think he's mistaken, i actually logged into the game to check
---
I want a damn frog.  That is all.
---
The most populated areas were Weston where the real life Fort Defiance is and Point Pleasant.  We were in Weston in the middle of the afternoon on a day the asylum didn't give tours so there wasn't really anyone there. Point Pleasant is used to so much weirdness in the town that no one looked twice.  However... when taking the Sutton pic a guy drove by in a pickup and gave me that Vault Boy thumb's up which was pretty cool.
---
Not saying you shouldn't lose your bag when you die, I am saying other players shouldn't be able to loot it if they didn't work for it. If they kill you, then yes, if no, then they shouldn't even see. Else I should be able to loot every body someone else kills because I put no effort into it, so why do players get loot for being lazy ?
---
PC. At least a half-dozen server disco dances today alone. No mods or ini faffery. When I first started up \~3 weeks or so ago the game was quite stable. Since then it has become increasingly unstable. 
---
It's approaching a threshold of near-unplayability with distressing haste ...
---
My friend's gone and I'm done with this. Thank you for your effort.
---
“900 hours guy”, dude,who,cares...That’s your claim to fame I guess.Why anyone would find a need or a want to “follow” you is beyond me.While I agree it’s sad that some people lost their accounts and are innocent,I don’t see anyone of them but you trying to make yourself an Internet personality due to their misfortune.When you deleted your original farming post,you should have deleted your reddit account to go with it imo.Get over yourself,move on.
---
My wife gets the credit for that. We printed reference pictures for each location to help get the poses and framing right.  They were still a little off, but close enough for me :)
---
Exactly what i wanted to know, thank you for your time and effort
---
Wonderful. We can all learn something from that.
---
No effects just vanity pet. Little holographic non combat monsters
---
Also, It's not wise to put a turret camp behind Whitesprings golf club.  People tend to get really, really, really, really upset when their ghouls and their loot are stolen.
---
To the stealth players who spawn camp in the golf club (downstairs mainly) you are not fooling anyone.  I don't like spawn campers, but don't do anything about it.. be careful you don't do it to the wrong player. People tend to get really, really, really, really upset when their ghouls and their loot are stolen.
---
Played the emotional card one last time. Here’s an idea, Bethesda gives you the ability to play one character at a time, not several. I heard sticking to that doesn’t result in a ban.
---
Fireproof 2 is only a 30% explosive damage reduction. Should be pretty good together with a Dense torso mod, but I don't think it makes you immune. Shotgun explosive damage may be 160% of base damage.
---
I dunno man, check the date, it was ADDED to Fallout 76's database on "2019-03-22" Why would they add old code to the game again if it wasn't there before and they had no intention on using it?
---
I'm on PS4 as well. It's ok. It might not have happened to you yet. But it will happen.  
---
The thing is you don't immediately notice a piece of missing gear. I didn't notice the piece of power armor, until it told me I couldn't fast travel. Then I noticed one of my calibrated legs was missing.  
---
I didn't notice the piece of missing cosmetic wear, till I went into third person.  
---
As someone else has mentioned in this thread, it has happened to them.  
---
I'm just wondering how common the problem is.
---
No it's great with explosive.
---
I lost a  gun once though it happened during a scorchbeast Queen fight with a lot of lag so I just assumed I accidentally dropped it somehow it seemed likely
---
Right? It pretty easy to tell when they use the word "cuck" as an insult unironically. I can only think of one subreddit where that's commonplace...
---
Really! That’s great news!
---
Tell ur friends to upvote so we get attention
---
This is epic!! I can’t wait to make it there!
---
Easiest place for Mirelirks is the creak bed next to Summersville are 8 level 5 crabs that spawn here consistently, also at New River Gorge Resort next to Flatwoods are a bunch of mirelirks.
---
Canines can be found at the Isolated Cabin just  east of the Gilman Lumbermill near Vault 76
---
They brainstormin
---
Can you not just buy your own things? Or does your wife control your entire cash flow? 😂😂
---
Little baby versions of creatures following us around would not be bad.
---
And I'm not going to keep hitting my pipboy to record 15 minute chunks of my game play.
---
I play every day for quite a bit and I think it's more likely you dropped it or sold it accidentally. I've seen people do it without realizing it. It's just not as easy to admit fault as it is cast blame.
---
Can you specify what you want?
---
Point taken.   So many ways to rationalize stuff.   What about people on teams, blah blah blah.   I’m lucky enough to not have lost much or had very many bags taken, either by PVP or by environment.   I did lose a sweet 3* due to the login bug.  Now that was the heartbreaker.
---
I'm a hoarder and have been used to just walking around the wasteland, but any increase would be appreciated. Now that there are some decent rewards for going into survival mode, I'd like to be able to stash my junk and aid before going in
---
I guess the bottom line is we have to prioritize and bite the bullet.  In other words, keep the essentials and dump the rest. I've had to do it!  Do it and move on my friend! It's only a game.
---
Yeah this is inaccurate, I use fireproof 3 and if I attack anything close in nearly instantly die.
---
Actually nvm, just realized I have next to no flux/caps within the probable price range of the baton, sorry for wasting your time.
---
Cuz people are Pussies and pick on people that are easy targets. They never go into survival mode either.
---
Still the same bullshit. 5 months and no 4-5 stars found yet
---
I can't help you without some proof, sorry.
---
Well your lucky, I'm away from my Xbox console and I can't get today's deathclaw Easter egg :&lt;
---
I have 50 power armor sets and I'm doing fine. It's just all about how you manage it and keeping what you need rather than want. Once you get that down, then you know how much space you have to play with
---
Well, the fact that it's a mascot head and probably means there's a set, so there could very well be a suit as well (but it'd didn't show up in the armor crafting bench like the head did, assuming it does exist).
---
"Sniper" does, for what it's worth. I can't think of anything non-obvious that would actually be useful.
---
It’s sad to say that it doesn’t surprise me at all! People do the lamest shit to get a couple caps! It’s like really dude? Your that thirsty for a couple caps that you would scam people or rip off people that don’t know better? It’s really not hard at all to make caps in this game if you just try. Whether it’s hunting cap stashed or hitting up the vendors or just taking 20 minutes to put up a trade post on reddit! Lazy weirdos.
---
That's too bad cause I was hoping y wanted my 5 bomber jacket;)
---
my nigga really a cuck out here smh. kick the bitch out and spend money on what ya like
---
This will be good for that "Take a pic while player is in PVP"
---
Then you need to put in the work yourself. It sucks that people are lazy or incompetent cunts, but sometimes you need to haul your best heavy weapon there and gun that assaultron down yourself. At least try
---
You merely adopted the stash limit. I was born on it (400 lbs) molded by it (600 lbs) I didn't see the light until I was already a man (800 lbs).
---
I always request a bit of ammo when I’ve finished checking the rest of their inventory. So they know I’m on the last tab
---
This guy right here..
---
Actually lost a piece of non-power armor. Was a leg piece. I logged back into play and it was just gone. Only happened once bit definitely happened...
---
You will love it. WV is such a beautiful state.
---
IGN MadTurin. On EST most evenings/nights. Have been delaying the main quests until 50th for the best loot. Love wandering aimlessly taking in the sights and trying not to get eaten by horribly mutated ... things ... 
---
Tomorrow being Easter Sunday my plan is to grill some chow and have a few beers while doing so before settling in for (hopefully stable) FO76 for several hours. 
---
I should probably put some effort into clearing out my stash ... hovering at 780-800 out of 800 is becoming irksome. 
---
If I don't see you in-game have fun! There's a wide, wild Appalachia out there!
---
This is amazing!
---
Yup, my first time dying in the event I get the ‘another player has taken your loot’ message. At least it’ll teach me to bank my junk before trying that again
---
Cannot believe they thought 400 was doable.
---
I feel like getting interesting legendary items use to be much better and now it feel like I only get garbage all the time. I was very excited for the legendary vender, but with the way things are going I think it’s more likely that you will just walk away with shit and disappointment most of the time. This game feels like it’s being nerft into oblivion? Will the legendary vendor fix this? I wouldn’t trust a reroll system with this game. I could see it turning my lvl45 1* TS stuff into lvl1 1* Hunters garbage. This game is beginning to suck and is just a crapy mask collecting simulator ATP?
---
Explosive weapons and downed sbs are a bad combination.
---
I wasn't expecting your help. I'm just letting people know about this bug.
---
I just signed in and I still take damage. It is less with Fireproof but it is still there. I noticed I didn't take damage yesterday with my explosive weapons. It must have been a bug. I will try to replicate it. Sorry guys
---
You could be right if it’s lag. Tomorrow I’ll change my geo filtering to a different location. I’m not sure where their servers are based, so prioritizing the connection might not be to easy. But worth a try. If you’re right, I’ll be extremely happy.
---
Well I can only do it if I’m on the same wifi network and I’m the same situation today, not at home and can’t get the egg
---
Enough to last about 25 min shooting almost the whole time.
---
When I was a child I lived on 200.
---
When I was a teenager I was raised on 600.
---
Now that I'm older I live with 800.
---
I want to live beyond the stars on anything beyond.
---
2k should be safe, but you'll probably use less than half of that unless it's a really bad group.
---
You may need to repair your rifle along the way if it's a long fight: There's a shed with a weapons workbench a short distance west of Dropsite V9.
---
LOL I don't sell stuff from my attire inventory to vendors. So it certainly wasn't sold.  
---
I'm trying to be helpful here. And as you can see by reading this thread, it has happened to other people.
---
Ok to start off. Dobt use one weapon. Use at least 1 rifle and 2 heavy weapons. For a gatling laser/plasma, bring about 5 cores each before they break. And for a handmade, is say to bring about 800 rounds if you're with other people.
---
Must be a nightmare to repair all of them if your using them concurrently.
---
I guess it all works out then
---
It just works.
---
Look for a trade instead. I've wasted 7 hours total looking for this bot. 17 different spawns and reloaded inventories and nothing so far.
---
Yeah, so did the trade stealing glitch that doesn't exist. When did someone claiming something become fact?
---
Haha. That's a lot different than I expected.
---
Any of the flip lighters works. Didn't even know this was today's challenge until I scrapped all of my junk and popped the challenge.
---
If your stash is full, get a friend to help you move some to a new character for a new 800 cap.
---
Keep posting about this so that it gets nerfed.
---
Some types of armor make more noise than others &amp; thus are less stealthy...
---
Back then was a bit different, they were chasing server stability over quality of life. Now that servers are a lot more stable than they used to be I'm hoping to ask for an increase.
---
I only use 2 or 3 of them. It's just to keep as a collection
---
Thought that was just me. This game will die the minute The Outer worlds or Cyberpunk 2077 comes out.
---
I’m going to try that, thanks!
---
How so?
---
I've seen the Morgantown one, but also one further south, I think somewhere between Arktos Pharma and the Overseer's Camp.
---
With the chems and ammo crafting, it’s 18 instead of 10 and a chance for 36, not 28.
---
Two shot weapons on their own aren’t very good now but two shot explosives are still some of the best and don’t require a low health build. Both bullets explode for extra explosive damage. That said, bloodied or bloodied explosive builds are insanely op if done right.
---
My own tips -
---
When firing a heavy gun at a fair distance, start firing just before you aim down the sights. This will cause the crosshairs to stay instead of disappearing like it usually does, which is helpful because some heavy guns don’t have real “sights”, like the .50 and the bugged gatling.
---
If you want to use a flamer despite it being a bit lacklustre, don’t craft the fuel for it. It uses fuel about as fast as a .50 if not faster and you get exactly 20x less. It’s extremely expensive to craft enough ammo to use the flamer consistently. Instead, go up to a flamer trap with the perk Home Defence 3 equipped and spam disarm. This works much better using a macro on pc. Disarming it yourself should work between a few and 30-40 times, using a macro could work up to a hundred or more times. It’s random. There used to be a bug where you could do it indefinitely, this was patched but it still lets you do it a bit.
---
For daily caps, I grab all the kickballs and basketballs at the Grafton school for rubber (in big metal bins), all the cue balls at the Bolton Green golf course as well as all the cat bowls at the house next to the farm directly north (unmarked location) for plastic, and all the beer bottles, glass cups etc from whitesprings golf centre to mass craft marine tactical helmets. 4 charisma + Hard Bargain 3 = 27 Caps each, of more with grape mentats/perks and alcohol/teammates. I do it in between adventures and have a few hundred ready to sell.
---
Don’t knock heavy leather armor. As a low level you can buy the plans fairly cheap and craft them from scratch. They have great damage resistance and power armor-level energy resistance.
---
Take your time when applying level ups. Use all the different types of weapons or watch videos before deciding on a build. If you put your first 50 levels into a rifle build and decide after that you want heavy weapons, you’re going to have to level up once for every special point you want to swap to another category as well as for almost every perk card you’ll need. Ouch.
---
Have your camp on the right side of the map to cut costs for fast travelling to areas on that side of the map.
---
For those who want to craft huge amounts of ammo, set up camp near an acid extractor and claim the workshop in the north of the map that allows three acid extractors. Remember to harvest the acid directly from the ground as well as from the extractors themselves, and lock them with a level 0 lock.
---
For lead, go to Lucky Hole mine, just to the West of the red zone. Bring excavator armor for the 4x ore boost and harvest all the lead ore. There are a few rooms off to the side of the main walk that have 4 deposits each and a bit more past those rooms. You should come out with around 260 ore, which is 650 lead smelted without super duper. Make sure to have super duper on.
---
For steel, go to Blackwater mine and kill all the mole miners. There’s about 6 outside and 12 or so inside. There are two at the end of the tunnel before the water in a room off to the left and most of them are in the area past the red doors on the left side halfway down the tunnel. Loot their rifles, shotguns and mini guns then scrap them with the perk scrapper equipped. 8 intelligence and scrapper gives 20 steel for assault rifles and missile launchers, 14 for pump and combat shotguns and 10 for double barrels.
---
You could also sell these for daily caps if you want, there’s a train station right by the mine.
---
Sometimes enemies will drop their weapon on the ground (you’ll see the actual weapon model, take it) and it will be in their inventory as well. I believe this happens when you shoot the actual weapon. I haven’t confirmed this, but it happens more frequently when shooting the weapon the npc is holding. It’s easier with an explosive weapon. More weapons = more caps or steel.
---
Sorry for the long post.
---
This is like the "trade stealing" thing. Claims, but absolutely zero proof and hostility when called a liar. Likely you sold/dropped/scrapped the item.
---
They have been adding some new quests and stuff in the Wild Appalachia update. I like them so far!
---
I forgot about that. That would make sense  lol
---
Character with a theme and some style. Sounds like it's fun to play even when you're not chopping down doors and planting explosives all over Appalachia!
---
I'm thinking of doing a New Vegas tour this summer....
---
I have a second character who's near that level &amp; it would be fun to team up! xa0t1ca (middle o is a zero)
---
Does anyone know where the plans for the chainsaw can be found? I have yet to see them at the vendors ( maybe I’m just unlucky...).
---
I got robots and snipers. I was sniped by another player while hunting mirelurks, and Im about to give up. Spent around 10 hours wandering empty Appalachia spaces. Ah, got trolled on an event while trying to get wolves too.
---
Haven't seen this. Where did you witness it?
---
Really me and my friends each have done it 10-15x we've failed 6x intotal We all have the sheep squatch outfit and mask only one of us has the imposter outfit. I'm usally the one turing on the pylons no one either seems to  understand the event or want to do that. I find it helpful to turn on 2 or 3 is the best run into the cabin and get down into revive mode were you have 35 seconds till you die in that time the pylons are still activated. Then repeat are new  thing is spending our daily caps for keycards and getting stable flourscent flux when we can
---
That mod (block powder rifle bayonet) is broken. It is supposed to be leaned from scrapping the black powder rifle but the OMOD record is setup incorrectly to have it leaned from scrapping the mod, not the weapon. It is the only learnable by scrapping mod setup that way, so nobody knows if it would even work. I have never seen the mod in the world, so I've not been able to test. It's not a guaranteed learn chance either, so you'd probably have to scrap a few mods to have a good chance at learning it.
---
If anyone has actually found this mod in the world, or if anyone has ever scrapped one and learned to craft them, please post and let us know.
---
I know man it’s like none of the developers have ever played a proper mmo,with real dungeons and raid bosses.The whole game is nothing but a looter/shooting gallery,with literally no need for coordinated gameplay whatsoever.
---
 It ruined a scorched earth run we a immortal scorched hermit crab
---
I found the plan somewhere when i was lvl 20
---
Just give me your gamer tag. I'm sure we can work something out
---
Thanks for the gold anonymous redditor!!!
---
Wait, are you straight up calling me a liar? Because if you are I will knock your teeth out.
---
Hey. I have a furious Gauss for sale. Selling for 800c. Hit me up on pc. IGN is ibnome.
---
LOL this hasn't just happened to me dude. It has happened to friends, and other people in this thread. Try and keep up.
---
And no I don't go just randomly dropping/selling or scrapping pieces or power armor that I am wearing.
---
Looking at the ESM, you don't learn this one by scrapping Black Powder Rifles, or from a plan, but by scrapping the bayonet mod. Not sure if it's automatic or a 15% roll.
---
Believe it or not I got it on the 4th server hop. Got it for 800 caps.
---
lmaoo this has nothing to do with men being manly or not this guy is just a bitch.
---
There are alot of cars in Whitesprings that blowup
---
And here's the obvious trolling
---
I’m getting excited now, would’ve never known if this post wasn’t up lmao, glad I commented
---
Okay, I'm p3ngu1n_assault. I'll add you.
---
What do you play on? I'm always looking for more PC friends!
---
I play on a gen 1 ps4. Almost every play session, I try to fast travel to a friend and I get stuck in an infinite loading screen and must close application. I have steadily had one blue screen error once per 4 hour gameplay session.
---
Today I stumbled upon 3 people in survival who had just murdered someone and were pilfering their loot when I came up. I was able to kill the 3 of them, but then bluescreened before I could even see what they dropped. Made me super sad because it was a tense few minutes.
---
On a positive note, I have only had an actual "server disconnect" like twice since the last 2 patches.
---
It's pretty simple at charleston station. From where you spawn, the vendor spawns just in front of the red shed to the left of the station (along with other kinds of mobs). All you have to do is as soon as you spawn in, run to the red bridge that's further down the tracks. Stop once you've gotten to the bridge and wait for something to spawn. Some people say you have to run further down the bridge, and etc. You don't. Just get a couple feet down the bridge and wait.
---
Good point lol, I feel like online would be more story driven quests/factions and what not plus hopefully the single player dlc, that’d be awesome. Don’t see another rockstar game coming out for a while anyways!
---
I live very, very close to Pt. Pleasant, so it's cool to see people coming by just because of Fallout 76! I dig it! Did you happen to go into the Mothman Museum? They have Mothman Pop figures there now Haha!
---
Why do you have to ask her?
---
I've had whole stacks of junk go missing. Sometimes it's important shit like steel or gunpowder, but I generally don't sweat it because of how easy that stuff is to obtain. If I lost PA, I'd be pissed.
---
The problem is, sometimes a player gets completely server locked for upwards of 40 minutes. I’ve spent that much time trying to find a different server before because it couldn’t place my fucking camp. It didn’t even work when I used the option that comes up when you join in, find a new world. Just dumped me right back in the same world. THAT shit needs fixing.
---
Doesn't sound like a troll camp but a filthy casual one😂 
---
Still I'd be pissed if one of my meticulously built camps was replaced with some dudes easter decorations.
---
I’ll check what the recommended specs are and see if I can play it! I usually just game on my Xbox, but I do have a pretty decent laptop, I’ll let you know when I get home!
---
4 serums? Each sell for 500 caps with grape mentat, sweet roll and max hard bargain perk card.
---
Nice! Those sell for a pretty penny.
---
Hmmm, if that's the case, I hope more people start farming it so there is a constant supply of ghouls.
---
We did!  Walked out of there with a lot of cool mothman swag.  I wanted the FO76 Mothman poster because it was so bad ass, but figured it wouldn't travel well on a plane.
---
If I remember right, Camden Park in the bathrooms also.
---
Yeah, obvious trolling. Calling people a liar, when they are trying to help the community. Trolling 101
---
Just so you know, you could get a lot of caps for that. Not from me, but from the right buyer.
---
There are sometimes two deathclaws there. If other players show up that can spawn in the 2nd one. No idea if more will spawn with enough staggered arrivals. 
---
I think of this place as the lair of a mated pair (since you can find 1 or occasionally 2 eggs in the nest) that know their sightlines to the eastern shore. Now and then you can draw a bead on one from across the water and snipe it/them to your heart's content. Just have to dodge a boulder or few.
---
Do you have the perk card that says it does this played?
---
I believe they go after the guy who’s doing the most damage, so it’s a complement! Your usefull!
---
This is so awesome, that had to have been so much fun! Ive never been to west Virginia, but thats the only place ive wanted to go since i started playing fallout 76. 
---
Awesome pics man!
---
Because I'm not there. :)
---
Really, I have the same problem. My main is level 310, uses a simple level 50 1* TS Gatling Gun, and is always the target of the boss, 75% of the adds, and almost every creature that spawns in the game even if someone else is around.  I often wear weak PA (Excavator). I attribute it to some combination of either being high level, relatively high damage output, or low defense. Not sure what the algorithm for default aggro is, but whatever it is my main seems to have what the algorithm wants. I suspect the main component of aggro is character level, but have no evidence to prove that
---
With fireproof and a dense mod on my chest armor I survive cars exploding with no damage and even mini nukes with negligible damage.
---
I mean if you have proof that I am making this up, I'm all ears.
---
Its SevenFurball439
---
Very rarely instead of ghouls you can have protectrons spawn at the whitesprings golf club. if someone nukes the area, for God knows what reason, they will be replaced by glowing ones but still be tagged as robots and any legendaries will explode.
---
Meh. The trade ui is crap. My wife and I constantly have issues passing stuff back and forth, and our screens are side by side.
---
Wife has this problem too, but for top of the world, top level. Can't progress in quest.
---
 Hopeful for a fix. I'm guessing a specific file is corrupt or mishandled somehow, and it would be fixed with fresh install. That takes ages though, so she is just waiting for a fix and playing the odd sidequest in the meantime.
---
I guess you can also call everyone else, who has had this happen. A liar as well.
---
Thanks! That's really good to know.
---
"letting you"
---
Awesome man! I think you can order them on the museum's website! I know it's not the same thing as getting it there, but it's an option!
---
Do a hard reboot on the console. Had that issue with big bend tunnel, and this fixed it.
---
I have had enough technicians pool sticks drop to build a house.
---
Its 20/4/2019 here
---
Here https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b6g53g/black_powder_rifle_bayonet/
---
Its a beta.  They're already going to go new-character-only with regular resets when the thing goes official.  
---
I didn't even bother reading your dissertation but I'm assuming that covers most of the whining.
---
Yeah man. Weak content.
---
Maybe money is tight, and they have to communicate and compromise on what they spend money on. Like in a marriage.
---
It'll be interesting to see if they offer future expansions -- whether they sell full expansions ESO-style with micro updates inbetween or cover costs by further incentivizing the Atom Shop.
---
Sorry all I forgot I made this post but i sold it for 10000 bullets and 3000 caps so thank you for your response but this is closed
---
This happens to me often. I shoot them, their health goes down, and then regenerates if I don't hit them fast enough.
---
If i hit one ghoul with one shot and then wait, it's life goes down, then back up (takes 4 total shots to kill). If i hit it with 3 quick shots, it goes down immediately. I wonder if enemies have health regeneration of some kind.
---
But they aren't. Attacker dictates when they are vulnerable, and you as the workshop owner are fucked if they decide to exploit that. The whole system needs a rework.
---
OK I’ll try it thanks.
---
Definitely bookmarked for when I have money again to buy it!
---
Bad wording, I meant they condone them, as in they don’t punish us for using them.
---
Looks awesome!!
---
Wait!!!
---
The green monster and the mothman are real!!!???
---
PC but that’s really nice of you man I appreciate it. On the bright side I can help people out myself once I have the plans.
---
This is pretty cool!
---
thanks for sharing
---
I've contacted Bethesda support, I did everything that they recommended me to do.   
---
It's no use.
---
Hot diggity damn. Nice. Maybe I’ll try that spot. I don’t really farm legendaries except the odd Blackwater mine event. I got a few decent weapons there, including a furious explosive combat rifle a couple days ago. I’ve gotten a few explosive weapons (.50, gatling, laser gatling, 10mm pistol, shotgun) with furious or aa but no two shot explosives.
---
I’m on pc and would buy it. How much you looking for, or are you looking for trades?
---
Honestly that sounds like an amazing idea!
---
They said DLC would be free, and I hope it always is, but I don't believe that will happen. That's a big promise for a video game.
---
They're not on the leggie loot table... Sucks it does 😕
---
No problem, One thing I forgot/ glossed over is that some armor are missing certain mods, Excavator and raider have no jet packs, and excavator lacks tesla coils, Although I am not as certain about certain mods/armors.
---
i guess so
---
I don't think spending your own money needs to be linked to those cunts.
---
Excuse Me?
---
It used to be the best, or at least most sort after weapon (maybe on par with shotguns) but now the most dps weapon is a bloodied explosive or maybe bloodied +25% fire rate .50 I believe.
---
Damn
---
Does it work with the anti-armor rifle mods as well? If so pistols could actually be a viable build
---
That's pretty dope man
---
Yeah, but Bethesda's sister company Zenimax Online already changed the nature of what DLC is  though. In Elder Scrolls Online they claimed all DLC would be free, too. They changed the definition of what DLC was later and introduced a full expansion (called a "chapter"), claiming DLC and expansion  are completely different beasts, and that technically most of the updates would be free, but the chapters/expansions would cost.
---
I could see Bethesda pulling the same card on 76 since they already did it in ESO.

We bought a paper map of WV and divided the state into quadrants, then planned the route so that we hit locations sequentially. It really cuts down on backtracking. Also make sure to have plenty of snacks and drinks because you are traveling in a car for hours and only out of the vehicle for a few minutes at a time to take the pics.  Since there's so much in-car time, make sure you're traveling with someone you like.  'Cuz it's not easy.  lol
---
Preach!!!!
---
I can build some bad ass stuff well fortified and once when playing my new character in survival and totaly walled up Hemlock Homes Lined it with Missle turrets ......the works just in case. My level 35. 
---
And i think a person Loaded in and proceded to get destroyed by my Workshop. I felt so proud of my Workshop but i wasnt happy about how i found out. thats not what i hope for peoples experiences tobe on the other end. Im sorry. Wastelands a bit@h right.
---
Well the second bullet does 25% of the original. So say your gun does 100 damage, two shot makes it 125. I think the explosive effect is 20% of the guns regular damage, so add 20 for the first bullet and add either 5 or 20 for the second (not sure which it is). That’s either 150 or 165. By default, no perks that’s a 50-65% increase.
---
You just have to be crafty bud.  If on Xbox, I'll help.  Go to places where others aren't.  Know which areas have which creature types.  I had a great time with this one.  I server hopped a few times, but just be vigilant in the future.
---
I’ve had the game crash on me twice and I’ve played since beta. My roommate as well.
---
Out of curiosity, if I have any amount of rads does that negate the instigating effect? Or do I just need to be at max “available” health?
---
Yes, they are as real as you are willing to let them be :) If you have Amazon Prime there's a couple of decent documentaries on them: "The Mothman of Point Pleasant" and "The Flatwoods Monster"
---
I've heard that there are sheep screams bear Brahmin deaths
---
Well it was supposed to be apap focused game mode from what they said about it before the survival beta release. I love it still tho even tho it got nerfed right away. I miss the cap farming and constant pvp
---
i wish i could upvote more than once
---
Yeah, we made sure to grab a business card. Probably spent too much money in the gift shop as it was, but I'm all for supporting local businesses...especially when they involve Fallout and/or cryptozoology.
---
Looks dope and has good damage. Not everyone likes sniping, some like to be up close and rain hellfire. Shotguns have a higher chance of mincing their owners if they don’t have Fireproof equipped and they don’t seem as good as they were before, I have a primed quad explosive pump shotgun that’s decent with all relevant perks equipped but it’s definitely not godly. I use my .50 instead.
---
I carry around a bolt action pipe rifle that does 120 damage per shot. I renamed it P.O.S. But I love it.
---
Grenadier doesn’t affect the legendary explosive effect, just so you know. It’s unfortunate. It only applies to actual explosives.
---
I’d love to do something like this, but for FO1. I’ve never played it all the way through. Does FO1 have any specific California locations? Anyone know?
---
For some reason, I do tons of extra damage there. Look at your weapon in the pip. The whole place just.... wants my knife inside. It's like a slutty girlfriend. Disclaimer: No girlfriends were stabbed in the making of this analogy.
---
I do very similar things in this game...
---
I hate that. Been wanting to put my calibrated shocks on my excavator power armor but it wont let me.
---
I use a primed ultracite Gatling laser so about 5 cores with power user. That's 5000 rounds.
---
I will play both those games.   But will keep playing this one as well.
---
I said "why not just play with us?"
---
Lol dammit I read your name in the voice.
---
Seriously my Xbox screen name, and you're welcome!
---
Have my upvote. Too bad you didn’t at least get a drill :)
---
2000 is a lot of caps, though. Sorry it didn’t work out.
---
This is great! You did an excellent job matching the specific locations, it's crazy how detailed they got!
---
I mean, they are planning to rotate through the leader boards, so we will see.
---
The leaderboard I am most looking towards is the kill stuff one, as it blends a nice balance of being able to avoid fighting and being forced to fight at some point. 
---
The time one was misery, you just got hunted at random, no matter what you did, could only avoid it by regularly suiciding, which with respawns is not a fun way to go about things.
---
This one is very passive, you can just not kill people, and you will never be found unless you want to be, and dramatically restricts pvp to a tiny handful of people endlessly cycling kills among each other, or one god tier pvp player who you can't take on sitting there waiting for other god tiers to fight him as no one else would be dumb enough to do it.
---
With generic kill you will have to deal with it at some point, but you have control over when, and how quickly you climb that board. Unless you go total pacifist mode, which is an option.
---
Initially, I was really drawn to the game because it was my home away from home. I loved seeing all these places I grew up around and spent most of the first few weeks running around to visit all the places in-game that I had visited in real life, not carrying about leveling up and shit.
---
I believe it was going to be infinite originally, but it had to be limited due to server issues. Unfortunately it’s a very severe limit. 800 is nothing. I really hope they don’t keep it limited, because this isn’t a hardcore survival like DayZ, it’s a Bethesda game. You’re supposed to collect stuff and hoarse things.
---
Then you, sir or madam, do awesome things. Or, at least, things that are similar to awesome. You should be proud, or something similar, maybe. Cool stuff might happen, possibly, notwithstanding your similarly maybe awesome stuff-doing.
---
It really is!  The Greenbrier was the one which really threw me for a loop because I'd never been there before but knew my way around perfectly.
---
Upvote, then downvote, then upvote again  haha  ;)
---
Yeah PA is horrible in comparison to most armor legendary effects. I hope they make some legendary PA effects or a subset of mods to help it a little.
---
Thanks for going through all this shit. I didnt do anything wrong and only did things on the game with a friend I know IRL. He wasnt banned but I was- if that helps prove my innocence. So i’m eagerly waiting an apology or at the very least an “unban”. I cant find answers anywhere and I literally miss the game.
---
Makes me so angry that I spent so much money and time and get suspended for over a month for something other people did. I talked so much shit on dupers then get treated like one lol. I dont even have two characters much less multiple accounts.
---
Best one yet.  Great job.
---
I like to consider myself a master bass player. Self taught. I can build a stage or I have a nice camp with all the instruments. I'll send you a FR.
---
I just found and extra one tonight.
---
Where you can get every Camp Plan, Workshops
---
I'm not sure where I got it, but if you're on Xbox, I can put your name on one of my extras.
---
Thanks but I’m on pc really appreciate it though
---
Alright I’ll try that
---
What platform are you on?
---
Are you on pc?
---
PC
---
I started the quest by picking up a note in point pleasant
---
But dont forest the Plans you get are always random
---
I love to carry a daisy cutter to effe ppl in the A when I am drunk, stoned or bored.  Last night, random 41 and 14 at my base, so I mounted my attack!  Slaughtered both with my meat claw.  They attacked my base.  Killed them both a couple times.  Found them on the map at their base.  Multiple mini nukes later, and killed them both over and over.  Much much fun.
---
Yah I know I’ll just hope for it
---
I have a 2* executioners+ limb damage Buzzblade that I use similarly except I'm not running a low health build. I run mostly 2h melee with some pints in rifles.
---
But like your chainsaw that buzz blade just eats people.
---
So I renamed it ~hungry hungry Mr. Handy...it works for me.
---
I like the part where 3 guys jump you right as their friend initiated the claim. I wouldn't mind if the workshop had a lock out timer for failed claims. Because until you leave the server they just keep doing failed claims just to force you into PvP so their buddy's can jump you again. It's a horrible broken system. Also when they do a quick claim attempt sometimes it is to quick to alert the owner of the workshop attack so you don't even know you're in PvP.
---
Shit, sorry. I'm on PS4. I know I got mine from a basic workshop defense event. I think it's one of many random ones but AFAIK it was the crummy junkyard by the vault.
---
Why on earth do some people and places put the month before the day? That makes no sense.
---
This map might help  https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?hl=en_US&amp;mid=1DuilfvNcMvhMosMjyZBL6Vgvjp4&amp;ll=40.391148339928186%2C-118.60673543892733&amp;z=7
---
Alright I’ve been afk at dabney homestead if I don’t get it in a hour or two I’ll move to the junkyard thanks though
---
Is it true that to get a legendary you want (in my case a 50CAL HMG) you need to be using weapons that are not similar for an increased drop chance? If so that's fucking bullshit.
---
Bloody mess
---
You made an excellent recreation of your character...or an excellent recreation of yourself in-game. Not sure which, LoL.
---
Well done. 😎👍
---
Just found out that they don't auto-scrap. Interesting.
---
I spent two hours total farming rubber from Grafton, glass from whitesprings and plastic from Bolton greens and the house near it to craft mass amounts of marine tactical helmet with super duper. Made enough for a couple weeks straight worth of instant 1400 caps from vendors every day. Sure beats having to farm and sell weapons daily.
---
I've got less than 600 in my stash rn, and less than 120 on me.  Just figure it out.  Quit hoarding chems, they weigh too much in your stash.  Also, stick to 2-3 types of ammo.  Also, my stash is where it is with 9 mini nukes in it... So... Figure it the fuck out guys.  Making mules is bullshit, figure it out with out having to find some fake way through!  You don't HAVE to have everything on your dude.
---
Grape*!
---
I checked the datamined spreadsheet, looks like Grahm or random drops (workshop defenses, etc) are the only ways to obtain that.
---
Damn I’ve recently found gram on two different occasions (literally 3 hours ago) and at the time I wasn’t refurbishing my bbq dang guess ima just go grinding at workshops
---
It doesn't make any sense that we can't make our homes inside of hardy, brick and steel prewar structures.
---
I made my first real camp out of the bunker on the skirts of Charleston. But Scorched kept respawning inside.
---
Owning a workshop flags you for PVP no matter what, because you are considered "defending" it. Even when not actually there. It's kind of an oversight i feel.
---
In adventure mode, you should only be flagged for pvp while in or near the workshop area. If someone wants the workshop, you'd naturally have to go back to defend it if you want to keep it. And if you dont want it anymore, then they get it when you dont show uo to defend it.
---
No one is currently updating this, but here is the link to the spreadsheet, in case it ever becomes useful. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174gcko5FeO-RLLwvAXB55v-3up_hXCrjCp5EGqOefzM/htmlview#gid=1273174772
---
Thank you
---
I dont know about you but i've been taking dead people's shit since i step out of the vault in every fallout game.
---
Yes. Every couple hours I crash or if I server hop a few times. Also since the second last update I haven’t been able to close it properly, if I choose quit to desktop it freezes for ten seconds before it says it stopped working.
---
I don't like you for some reason. Drunk stab stab. Caps! Life is awesome.
---
Might be a yearly thing who knows
---
The maintenance was scheduled so that’s not a crash. The connection issues could’ve been the extra strain on the server from the SBQ fight but I haven’t had that for a long time. I do randomly get the “server has stopped responding” though.
---
You won’t see video because it happens between logging into servers as far as I can tell. My excavator calibrated leg disappeared so now I have to save for the plans. I didn’t drop it, didn’t sell it and I didn’t scrap it. It just got deleted.
---
Ash trays oddly don't work, just FYI for anyone coming across this.
---
It’s all random, and as you learn more mods your chance of learning others becomes less. But yes, you can. I do it for an armor mod I’m trying to get.
---
Lmgs doesn't have any mods besides automatic...but most weapons can be scrapped to learn a mod since most of them aren't sold at vendors
---
Can't remember the quest name but look up pyrolyzer. That's one of em! :)
---
Do you have maxed stats for CND? Looking for a maxed ultracite set.
---
:p
---
somebody else can comment to specific weapons. yes, and you only have to craft the low level weapon and scrap. some weapons take a lot of scrapping to obtain mods.
---
You magnificent bastard, now I know what I'm doing next time my CAMP spot is taken
---
Cosmetic wear bought from the atom shop cannot be dropped and he said he doesn’t sell from his apparel. I started selling marine tactical helmets for caps after losing my calibrated leg, and when I lost it I was only selling aid and bulk junk. I couldn’t have scrapped it because I don’t scrap armor, only weapons and junk. I couldn’t have dropped it because it had paint on it that I’d bought from the atomic shop.
---
I've been hoping for a mail system for a while. I have one character who knows just about all the plans and all the mods. It's sucks waiting for my friend to get on to pass a weapon it armor to my crafter for him to spruce it up and pass it back.
---
I'm seeing ghouls and also super mutants tonight burst into flames as i pummel them.  this is new!  It's not bloody mess b/c i don't have that perk and also it reduces my health when it happens.
---
Ok thanks just wanted to be sure before I tried
---
I can agree to this.
---
However I have had some situations where a report could be useful. I've had bugs with pacifist mode that's caused me to be killed on multiple occasions. That's just a glitch though. 
---
You're right though, if it's an actual fight in survival or PVP is initiated and you get killed it's your fault. No need for a griefing or cheating report.
---
Westtek and WS and cranberry bog.  I'm not using PA anymore... not sure why that makes a difference...
---
Ack, don't do that!  Great... now Fissure Prime's going to respawn in a completely random place.
---
Enforcer in agility works wonders for crippling legs.
---
What are they? Junk? and if so what do they provide?
---
Heavy weapons belong with PA like a fat kid belongs with cake
---
Why does it make no sense?
---
They are indeed junk. They scrap for 2 bone a piece. I picked up three from the brahmin.
---
Lol your a dork 🤣😋
---
I'm on the Xbox and had to actually restart the entire system in order for the egg to show up.
---
You're such a dork! :D I mean that with utmost respect! This is so great, I love it. Also so cool to see how well they recreated WV in the game!! good job!
---
It would be awesome, yes. Unfortunately, the backend coding that it would require in the game, plus the excessive amount of dedicated server storage it would take to render custom images on each players camp walls doesn’t seem feasible.
---
We can’t even display decorative junk.
---
Yea I couldn't find him on reddit
---
Can you show us your build.....
---
I was in the mire and I encountered said scream
---
I just thought of something else. Check all vendors you go to, possibly at Whitespring. You might be able to buy a cheapo one from a vendor to scrap. For some things this is easier than using a ton of materials to craft the item. I sometimes find the armor piece I need for ~50 caps and it’s a lot better/easier than grinding for the materials to craft it.
---
Yup. I knew I forgot it.
---
Simple: acquire legendary armor with 20% weight reduction perks and you'll never have to worry about weapon weight again.
---
There you go. Lol.
---
I an become...ummm...me??
---
Meh. Sounds like a good time in survival but in adventure mode, unless the people you’re messing with are high levels with a good chance at defending themselves, you’re a cunt.
---
PS4
---
Thank you! I try hard. ;)
---
Because it’s like counting 1, 3, 2. It’s day, month, year in most countries because it’s from low to high. Month day year is awkward and the few countries that use do it that way just confuse everyone else.
---
I understand your pain. Gave up on doing this mission myself.  Thought I would give it one more try when it popped up yesterday. Couldn’t find the body after it was done to get any loot , and revived my seventh white wolf hat in a row.  Never have got anything else. Just the hats from it. Lol
---
In GTA V you could add mp3 files to a specific folder that the game would then play if you chose the custom radio in a vehicle. Other players couldn’t hear it because it was client side, pretty cool though. Something like that would be awesome, with a client side radio option.
---
I've been doing that with some weapons while I was stock piling springs screws etc thank you again though for the tip
---
I have so many of those freaking hats. I drop them at the overseers camp for noobs
---
Omw
---
I feel like bandolier is just waste to me like ammo will only stack up to maybe 10 pounds and really you can an extra 20 pounds of carry weight with strong back
---
Crimson and violet galore
---
This is my boomstick!
---
Since when is t-51 superior to t-60 in ballistic?
---
Ribbons... yeah right.  I know intestines when I see them.  *Paper* intestines.
---
Amazing!
---
Watoga is a bust now not had anything good and no more legendary robots.
---
There’s also a bug that gives 100 carry weight on top when you log in. Dying or getting out of your power armor resets it. So say you have 260 regular weight and 460 with a calibrated excavator set, you’d have 560 when you log in. Like me :).
---
I just looked up the ammo weights. Has no idea is was THAT low. Strong back is better. What would be good for that last single point?
---
Unstable Isotope mutation. You are the one exploding.
---
I found one too.
---
Incase someone from another counsel needs one. Xbox
---
Excavator gives up to 200 weight more when calibrated and using the log in bug, compared to x-01. Its much, much better for weight.
---
Send in a ticket or email Bethesda I’m sure they’ll understand
---
Baseballs are not scrapped as junk because they can be turned into baseball grenades if you want to get rid of them you have to scrap them yourself.
---
There are actually a number of other pop-up trailers like that around the map but they are out in the woods pretty far from most landmarks unsurprisingly. I think I remember one near Tygart water treatment to the east up the hill, could be buildable. If you are looking for buses to build in there are two with a little roof inbetween them just barely South East of Sunday Brothers Cabin.
---
Yeah, I had bought the skin just for it.
---
Man I got the plans from Formula350, sorry bro.
---
Tank killer just one level I mean if you where doing a rifle build then yes full tank killer but your not so just one should make rifles more useful
---
I find month, day, year to be much easier when it comes to scheduling. Making doctor's appointment that are months in advance? Putting the month first tells you when it is so you can reach that page and then schedule the day.
---
You think it's better because you grew up with it. I think it's better because I grew up with it. Doesn't matter what other countries do. It's like 24 vs 12 hour clocks, Fahrenheit vs Celsius, etc
---
Goodness, this feature is coming to 76 in the near future. :)
---
There are times that the mod doesn't work. I actually accidentally scrapped my Hunter's Long Coat which was favorited while having the mod installed due to what I think was UI lag.
---
The lag that happens when you scrap multiple items in succession was the cause I believe.
---
Tbh I wasn’t going for the rifleman stuff I just went with it to go with the ranger theme. And to have a little extra if the damage department. 
---
I just didn’t see anything else that screamed for pistol use. I was thing on a small vats back up but the Single Action Revolver doesn’t have the ammo imo for that.
---
thank you... i did see this mutation show up today.
---
I’d rather pay $10-20 for a dlc like anything from NV or FO4 than keep getting things like the sheep squatch event or one forgettable interior for free. I’m waiting for them to say they haven’t made enough money to create something like far harbor, but that’s crazy with $10 PA skins for sale.
---
I love how you even have the right outfit. :p
---
Soon^(TM)  Too lazy to find the ITV or Interview but it was mentioned at some point recently.
---
Have you tried aiming instead?
---
They're all in the atom shop, but I don't know if they're still free as I already own them. They're not all together, you gotta scroll.
---
Or 25k caps for 1k atoms for those who have bought everything else caps can buy.
---
At launch console, launching in a few mins
---
This game must be even radder if you live in wv.
---
Fallout Edinburgh next please.
---
Well lever action fits western theme but takes forever to get but it’s worth the wait
---
I've had it crash at literally every step lol. Ah well, at least when I get to play it's fun.
---
r/MurderedByWords
---
Wait...West Virginia's a real place?
---
I know this person are they the ones who spent several wasted hours grinding fasnacht from start to finish in the hope of getting a stupid mask. Each time saying to themselves this time will be different with less and less excitement. Still to this day they can hear the faint echos of that marching band music perminintally etched in their memories. They have now moved on and continue to farm for legendary items, but can see that life in the wasteland is starting to suck... and the only way to find cool legendary items anymore is to create 20 mule accounts to hold 25000 caps each hoping to find someone online who excepts caps (are they totally worthless btw?) for an item that will be nerfed next week. They will soon discover this game is broken, but despite this will continue to play in hope that things will change. They would really like to see better drop rates on items hoping that might return balance back to the wasteland.
---
I mean honestly put the point where ever you want it’s just tank killer even lvl one makes rifles decent and pistols are not the best so having a rifle as a backup is a good idea
---
They’re getting grumpy because they’re just on survival for the experience boost, not the pvp. Which kinda makes sense but they shouldn’t be walking around with things they’re willing to lose if that’s their only reason for being there.
---
I probably will regardless. I just wasn’t sure there was better.
---
😂
---
I hear ya, I have similar concerns. This legendary vendor will likely keep people playing the game more but we will still need more quests and endgame contest to whet our appetites.
---
Currently we have the SBQ fight, the ISP fight, and (nuked) burrows. I like the challenge the ISP fight has created. With the constant drain on health, much of the time it is just a matter of having plenty of stimpaks.
---
I can't prove this thing happened.
---
You prove I'm wrong instead.
---
???
---
That's not how the burden of proof works.
---
I'm hoping there is a stash increase with the player vending update, since everything in your vending machine will be taking up stash space.
---
If you charge your shot before entering VATS it will miss.
---
Enter VATS then charge and it should work.
---
I mean once your past 50 you can start experimenting with other cards
---
Yeah. I might have too. The roadmap feature on the bottom doesn’t seem to link up with perk cards correctly.
---
I really like some of the rarer energy weapons like Tesla Rifles and the Cryolator, this was the only way I could find more than a few mods for them.
---
I love your dedication! Absolutely awesome!
---
I miss a lot at 95% chance with a melee, or sometimes my character just sits there and doesn't attack despite them being in my face.
---
It literally says “ your shotguns” on the perk card.
---
This.
---
Same as with the player being able to display items in their camp. It's going to exist and still take up valuable stash space.
---
Are the recreations the top of bottom pics is each set?
---
Never happened before last patch, gonna try  thx for info.
---
I wonder what triggers it. This never happens to me and I always use my quick slots. I don’t think it’s having lots of weapons because I farm Blackwater mines for weapons to scrap into steel and it doesn’t happen.
---
Someone datamined a bunch of stuff and said they could be for a new throwing weapon
---
My drunk stab stabs are probably more deadly.  Mine are more like.. drunk... Stab... Laugh... Vomit on dead body.  Destroy base with stabs.
---
Go to youtube and make a playlist
---
Surely 1 Stars won't be worth anything because you can farm these pretty easily.
---
It has been like that since launch.
---
Protip: Install F2P games on your wife's phone until she gets into them. Wait until she spends 50 bucks on micro-transactions, then use that excuse to buy a game. That's actually how I got Fallout 76, wife spent a bunch on Final Fantasy: BE.
---
Just launched
---
Vanity, mostly. I've got about a dozen suits to utilize. I usually make another suit when a cool paint is released as well. I made another suit of 01 for the quantum and another Exca for Bone Daddy. I've had an extra suit of 45 ready to go ever since War Rider was datamined ages back.
---
Just a note though, Ultracite is comparable to 51 statwise iirc. However, it's mod selection is more restrictive.
---
Have anything in mind for armour set, and or legendary effects?
---
I am a cunt. I spend most nights hunting the 150-200 range, but when I sense a mule with potential piles of junk, I pounce. Fallout is the only place where you can completely fuck someone and not get an std.
---
Not sure if it's possible due to copyright laws and stuff like that. I'm pretty sure that when bethesda bought the rights to use a song in a game it was only for that specific game not for all fallout games.
---
Making all fallout songs available in Fo76 might be way too costly.
---
Well, today just sucks for multiple people
---
It’s one egg per day
---
Since beta u had to wait atleast 2sec or you would miss, but that has been fixed.
---
And yeah, i have to charge it in vats, not before. So thx one mere time
---
Guess you're not that good at surviving
---
Same with the charging mod on a Tesla rifle. Seems charging weapons will fire at the point where you started charging even if the enemy moves, at least for the first shot.
---
I swear to god I should apply to become a bug tester for Bethesda. These kinds of things are exactly what I would test and it would take me less than ten minutes to come with every bug that could possibly occur from an update.
---
I still have that "Journal 3" from Gravity Falls... Your work gives such a familiar and warm vibe!
---
I can only imagine how amazing it feels to actually hold this in your hands... I need it... I want it!
---
Wow stfu
---
Here's how it works now:
---
* Engine connects to server
---
* Engine sits at loading screen while loading world
---
* Engine loads world
---
* Engine notifies you CAMP location is taken
---
Here's how what you're asking would work:
---
* Engine sits at loading screen while it loads world
---
* Engine sits at loading screen while it loads in player CAMPs and borders
---
* Engine sits at loading screen while it attempts to place your CAMP
---
* Engine sits at loading screen when it detects your camp is taken
---
* Engine connects to different server if CAMP can not be placed
---
* Engine attempts above steps again
---
* Several players with CAMPs in commonly used location flood fo76 Subreddit with posts about how last patch causes really long load time.
---
I farm weapons too. Only does it with legendaries for some reason and it only changes my shotguns too.
---
Agreed. I had someone tell me "they know someone"  at Bethesda and are reporting me to make sure I'm banned for cheating because they ran up on me in their excavator armor (groan) twice to kill me to take the bounty (placed on me in pvp server and brought back to the adventure server) and lost. Right off the bat its obviously not their fault they lost must be cheating involved. Not the fact that they tried pvp someone in excavator armor or anything......or that someone is better than them. There are people better than me and I dont run around yelling cheaters and dupers everytime they win.
---
You sort of mentioned the concern of people running off, and it can happen. But if you don't want to wait to find plans for yourself, Baronik is legit. He's got major karma on all of the trading subs and from personal experience, my interaction with him was great. +Rep
---
Def not fixed. Been doing it for a couple weeks now...
---
I take this and raise you a vampire's shredder.  Walk through whitesprings, kill anything in a fraction of a second and never lose any health.  (Bloodied build like you.)  For more fun, I pull out my bloodied shredder and kill almost anything instantly, but don't get the constant health regen.
---
I'm actually one of those that enjoyed it. But it wasn't the event per se. It was the community coming together for a fun time. High and low levels, everyone had a chance to score some really nice loot. And I only got two masks outta the deal. I'm happy with it.
---
Better than all tips articles on the first 10 pages of Google combine.
---
I just wish so badly you used a bit bigger character model. It would have been perfect and more represented of your actual beautiful self!!
---
8/10 amazing!
---
I could join you. What time do you usually play, and how long?
---
Yeah man be specific. I have some good rolls on pc, bloodied + power damage etc. worthless if you’re not a bloodied build though, or on pc.
---
Add KEAZAR. Stop by anytime. Power leveling services available as well.
---
I heard it’s going to be a 1* metal leg, so just think of it as any other 3* Legendary mob.
---
Currently on right now for a few hours. Typically I'll play sometime after 11pm EST on weekdays and whenever on weekends.
---
I love this. WV has a special place in my heart and I love seeing it represented so positively.
---
I hope so. I did as you said at the same time of writing this post, and received a reply recently. Unfortunately, it was extremely generic and just asked for the explicit name of the item, as if the person sending the response didn't even read it, or perhaps that it wasn't even shown to a person at all at that point in the process.
---
With just max fireproof you can survive car explosions, mini nukes, and sonic screams. If you also equip Ghoulish you will gain life from blowing up cars you're standing on and Super Mutant Suiciders; no dense mod needed, you can safely replace it with something better.
---
I'm level 206 and still never gotten a TSE anything.  :(  I've gotten TS and I've gotten E, but never together.  Of course I've bought some, but it's just not the same.
---
My son actually found a 3\* TSE gatling gun with 90% reduced weight at the white springs train vendor a few days ago.  Bought it for a few hundred caps.  I'm absolutely floored someone sold that to a vendor, and more floored my son found it to buy.
---
“I mentioned it once, but I think I got away with it alright.”!?
---
I remember when my wife asked to transfer 70 euros to her account, cuz she was all out this month... I didn't mind, but still was curious to know where these hard-earned money units will go. I was definitely NOT ready to find out, that 70 euros will be spent SOLELY on her hair. I've never been the same ever since.........
---
That says 421.
---
You never have a 4/20? :(
---
Fantastic!
---
I read these when you first posted them and showed a couple folks I know IRL who are into Fallout. I might have to get one for my wife, she'd squee for sure.
---
Upgrade it
---
MY Whitesprings camp is just a generator and couple of concrete foundations with "Fuck Turret Camps" written in Neon letters.
---
&gt;next fallout will be out within 4 years
---
Not even close.
---
Todd Howard said the next Bethesda game is Starfield, then Elder Scrolls. The main Bethesda studio won't even be starting a new Fallout game for years. Then it will take several years to finish it.
---
Thanks to all who came out 🙏
---
Thanks everyone who came out 🙏
---
You have to completely quit the game in order for the atomic shop to refresh?!?  I logged in last night to collect my egg and didn’t see it.  I collected the first three no issues, and didn’t have to force quit my game from the Xbox dashboard.  After 2 nights in a row with no new egg, I start hunting around and find this thread.
---
Wow Bethesda.  Bravo.  Good job on this daily login to claim a limited item, because you can’t figure out how to refresh the atomic shop on clients.
---
I didn’t know that was possible, I assumed this was already a feature
---
Get VATS crib damage card
---
Welp it’s been fun guys
---
You know that crouching removes your icon from the map right?
---
How u get it so strong?
---
Well I’m offline now, but tomorrow I might be on all day. My IGN: Ranger_Rancor. Do you use a mic?
---
Edit: and if you have zero kills you can never be on the map even though it can say you are in the top three.
---
Go to your armour crafting bench, select headwear, then select “toggle unlockables” scroll down to the greyed out yet to be unlocked items and you’ll see in the list  the bunny head with the word free next to it
---
I'll give you 2 nuke cards to drop another on her once for me?
---
As have I. But are these people going to come back in a matter of seconds 
---
? Yes.
---
Happened to me too. 
---
Had 2 BoS science scribe armor. Wanted to sell 1 and noticed, that there was only 1 left.
---
Don't know, if more stuff is gone
---
I do. I'll probably be on later in the day.
---
Just go own one. Don’t be a coward. It’s free rewards and plans. The risk is worth it. Experience and gear.
---
And 250 caps.
---
Hold on there, sensei. I didn't know you were a prospector of data. This is slightly off topic, but looking at your link there shows some data on the old Enclave Plasma Gun. Please share your wisdom on the matter! Is it true that it's identical to regular Plasma guns, no extra tagged damage modifiers outside pistol/rifle?
---
Please elaborate.
---
So, basically I have to server hop and check out the Whitespring until I notice a significant increase in legendary drops / quality and then stay in that world and hit the usual spawn locations for 3\* legendary enemies (like West-Tek)...?
---
I've seen pictures of datsmined items and pretty sure this is happening.
---
I like to look at sea of thieves for a games as a service example, when sea of thieves first came out it had 3 fetch quest factions a raid and 2 ships now it has 4 factions weekly events roaming bosses like the kraken, megaladon and skeleton ships, a new dangerous area, an arena and  improved ship combat like harpoons and breaking someone’s mast and that’s only a year later 
---
Imagine what fallout 76 will be like even in just a year, right now we are in the middle of the first of three dlc this year and look how much has changed already
---
I'm about to go to bed but I'll check this out first thing tomorrow
---
It will help you survive a few extra rounds against casual players and maybe one or two extra rounds against hardcore players. Every little bit helps but your better off maximising dps and trying to find legendary armor that works best. The absolute best roll is sentinel/assassin’s/increased AP refresh. It’s incredibly unlikely you’ll one of those on your own and they’re worth potentially hundreds of thousands of caps on the market, but you can find just 3* sentinel armor on the market for reasonable prices. Maybe 20k caps for a full set, probably less from the right people. Not much for most players unless you’re suuuper casual.
---
In case you don’t know, sentinel lowers all incoming damage by 15% when standing still per piece. 5 pieces = -75% of all incoming damage. Then assassins lowers damage from players by 8% each, so -40% total. They don’t stack, they’re multiplicative. So first remove 40%, then 75. 100 vase damage would be first lowered to 60 damage (-40%) and then -75% of 60, so 15 damage. A total of 85% damage reduction.
---
Sorry for going on like that I just wanted you to have the most information I could give. Also, here’s a link to a post with a spreadsheet that shows not only all the possible legendary effects, but also what possible combinations there are for two and three star legendaries for weapons and armor. Really helpful.
---
https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a2n39c/this_spreadsheet_shows_which_legendary_effects/
---
Sounds good, I’ll see you then.
---
Thanks for the info. I found all five around that area.
---
I’m hoarding too but any armour I really don’t want to ditch I convert to ultra light build reducing its weight so I can keep hoarding lol
---
I proved this thing happened. I saw it, and others have seen it.
---
I'm a level 5 and new to the game and this makes *me* feel bad for them. JK who would
---
Nice, creekside water looks more irradiated irl.
---
Add me, I gotta get off for tonight. I will launch more tomorrow. I can solo silo in like 15-20 mins. EasyE HD
---
I was there when this happened. Somebody killed the SBQ with a plasma gatling, she turned to goo... never landed. I then immediately killed *another* scorchbeast flying around, though low to the ground, and this one also turned to goo, and there was no loot on the ground (neither plasma nor meat pile).
---
Plasma goo animation + flying scorchbeast = no loot.
---
No offense to you but I doubt they'll do it for a single person that missed one egg. They would, however, more than likely bring it back for next year so atleast theres that.
---
👍
---
Cool stuff now only if they’d do a fallout game in Canada so I could recreate it
---
Pft, that's got nothing on my Assassin's rolling pin.
---
Sure, establishing proper spending habits is a portion of a healthy, mature relationship. On the other hand, having to regularly ATTEMPT his wife to spend $23 for a video game is absurd.
---
&gt; Finally talked my wife 
---
He's been trying for a little while.
---
&gt; into letting me buy this.
---
He is buying it. He has the money. It's his money, he had to go to his wife and convince her to ALLOW HIM TO SPEND TWENTY-THREE DOLLARS TO GET IT.
---
Still not getting what mysterious means, just because you personally have done something doesn't mean it's not mysterious to another person
---
You didn't get a screen at 420? Were you high or something?
---
I have 2 characters level 95 and 88 and I’ve never played with anyone.. it’s plenty fun enough on my own :)
---
Why would you post if you didn't get the pic at exactly 420? Are you high?
---
Were you on PC? You were probably in my server haha
---
Sorry, unless you have this on video, I'm calling BS.
---
Additionally, you can farm the Distant Thunder Event, which gives a random T-60 or T-51 plan; either mods for it or actual Armor pieces.
---
"RTX On"
---
I remember when back when I first started playing; following the Responders quest line, learning all the lore regarding these new additions to the wastelands of post-apocalyptic America . “The disease is vicious - don’t let these things near you” was the overwhelming message.
---
“Ok” I think to myself, “these things are like zombies. If one deals me melee damage - I’m going to suffer some disease related negative effect. Better keep my distance,”
---
That lasted all of a day. By level 12 or so, I’m fighting these things with a rolling pin, walking pin, or whatever blunt edged object I can equip. Now, at level 62, I fight these jokers with bare fists if I’m bored and looking for a fair fight
---
It should negate
---
Its the player vendor update. The one that'll add vending machines that players can build to sell stuff.
---
I should have made it more obvious by saying "player vendor update"
---
Is that just straight,inning to the end or exploring all the different areas?
---
That's what I'm thinking. 3 different tokens. 3*s pay one, 2*s another, 1*s a third. Rerolling a second tier stat costs 2* star tokens, a third stat costs 3* tokens. It would stop you from turning in very common 1* junk to eventually perfect your main weapon. 1* trash would only let you reroll primaries,
---
I would say Beam Splitter if you happen to have a TS/AA/B Explosive Laser Rifle but, more often than not, the Beam Focuser is your best option.
---
Unless you have a video of you calling BS, I don't believe you.
---
Yeah but I suffer from loneliness (if you can call it that... I am more depressed when I am on my own than with others soo yeah) so I want to play with people as there are no NPC's to keep me company
---
Unless you have a video, of you saying you don't believe me, saying that I was calling BS. I don't believe you.
---
i dont know if you throw the summon grenade if one will come, i think its only workshop areas that got it, but if you have a base near enough artillery can hit it
---
3 as of right now, I avoided this game for the first 5 months since I heard and saw nothing but terrible things, finally I cracked and bought it since fallout 4 wasn't doing much for me anymore
---
The game plays fine, although I have seen way more bugs in this game than any other fallout, and there are still huge flaws both in gameplay and in its mechanics. 
---
I haven't even been able to play co-op, the sole reason to play this game, until 3 days ago when the bug that kept me from teaming up with other players fixed itself after countless hours of me ramming my head into a wall of broken code.
---
And this possible incoming lootbox bullshit has me on the edge of lowering my score even more...
---
But otherwise, it's ok... But sometimes ok is just not enough
---
Do you happen to record every minute of every play session *just in case* something goes wrong?
---
When the flying bodies turned to atomized goo they never hit the ground. They just vanished after the animation as they fell to the ground. There was no green puddle, no meat pile. It just vanished. So it's a PSA to alert people. Use plasma gatlings on the queens all you want, but stop firing before you get the killing shot. We all lost loot because of this bug.
---
I've been scraping combat armor for mods and it is taking forever to unlock the shadowed paint mod.
---
Oh you mean the overtly cliche characters?
---
Wow. This Android thinks he's an old school Private Eye....
---
Maybe we can get Piper .... The sassy, determined reporter with a sassy little sister..... In this post apocalyptic world they've only been able to rely on each other....
---
Or Boone..... The quiet, brooding, sniper of few words....
---
Or maybe what's his face sheriff of Megaton.... A no nonsense, protective leader, mistrustful of outsiders .... 
---
Most human(oid) NPCs in the Fallout games aren't nearly as interesting or full of personality as people think. They're just common tropes
---
Well you are already bug tester, we all are, but not paid. We pay them.... :D
---
Also the weird. Think Wild Wasteland perk. 
---
The new content features weird.
---
I mean I don't doubt you. But I made a claim about a bug earlier on this page. And that was the answer I got "Unless they see video proof of it, they call BS."
---
Finally left my wife to play with this
---
Repair Kits aren't pay to win. 
---
Not even close. It's pay for non impactful convenience.
---
Because somebody called your bug report BS you instantly also became the kind of person who calls BS on other people? Because they doubted you now you doubt us? Uhm...
---
okay, cheers man! i'll add ye
---
No I have seen it also, marsupial only and super mutants and ghouls have been detonating like a mini nuke
---
This is what it feels like to be a married man trying to sleep in on the weekend.
---
Very interesting info. I just bought from a vendor a 2\* anti armor-explosive pipe gun and I'm going to turn it into an automatic rifle.

Reddit Post: "Game stopped working after update!"
---
First reply: "Uninstall your mods."
---
Hope you fast traveled everywhere those hills suck
---
Why not. It seem to be the way this community works.
---
I mean maybe, but given that explosive doesn't even spawn on energy weapons any more, that's a very niche market.
---
Can you provide video evidence of your claim?
---
I'm level 120 and carry a walking stick with no mods. I wear a full tuxedo and bowler hat while sauntering around the forest. I get so many thumbs up from low level players when I run around killing scorched and ghouls with a cane dressed as the Fancy Man of the wastes.
---
Hay do you mean god knows what reason? Everyone knows what reason silly.
---
Tens times better than Raider RP.

I did look it up myself in the data files:

I just want a normal dog who chills by the fireplace and is always happy to see me when I come home. The ability to interact and say good boy like fo4 would be a bonus.
---
Regular robots have been exploding for me at random. Not legendaries, and all types of robots - me.gutsies, protections, assaultrons. Very annoying. Maybe it’s not just robots. There was a change to legendary and sentry robots death explosions in the last patch...
---
I thought that the scorched would turn me into a zombie hybrid or some shit like that cuz i read it on a note.
---
Floor decor.
---
Thanks! Just server hopped about five times.
---
First two had nothing there.
---
The next one had the wood axe plan
---
Then the baton plan
---
Then the [pump action shotgun](https://imgur.com/a/lVaPdkJ)
---
So thanks for the info
---
Haha wonderful, glad to hear it. 👍
---
As someone that doesn't live near the places where most games take place, it would probably be a too surreal feeling for me. "This is where I like to put up my camp" would just make chaos with my mind. :P
---
[How talking to the manager would probably look like](https://youtu.be/2j-dbpcVSm0?t=143)
---
Is this picture some kind of scam to get people to read the post? Or is this armor available?
---
Sorry to hear that happens to you, hope you at least got some good loot from quest award itself.
---
What’s power leveling?
---
Between daily runs of Whitesprings, Wes-Tek, Urianium Fever, and now Harper's Ferry, I think I sell about 500 pounds of legendary items every day or two. I wouldn't worry too much about saving them for the trader.
---
Dude this is amazing! Would you mind sharing the post processing methods/settings used to create the fallout effect in the pictures? It looks spot on.
---
To see the costume, you have to have 300 tokens. By buying the mask first, it dropped you below 300 tokens. You should have bought the costume, then the mask.
---
**Bugs**   
---
\- Moonshiner's shack south of Vault 76 (4x) ticks  
---
\- Gilman Lumber Mill (4-5x) just south of above  
---
\- Path to Enlightenment (infinite)  
---
\- Glowing jug structure north of Clancy Manor in the woods (\~10x)  
---
\- Aaronholt Homestead north building has 3x roaches, the field to the south has a lot of bugs roaming (\~7x) , north part of the field is a shack with bee hives which you can loot to spawn bee swarms (\~6x)  
---
\- Mosstown usually has a few ticks  
---
**Mirelurks**  
---
\- Tygart Water Treatment (2x) - need to be quick before liberators bully them  
---
\- Follow the river south from there by Summerville (7x) - good for low levels  
---
\- New River Gorge Resort (4x) - one or two in the hard to get in cabin and two in the pool  
---
\- Wendigo Cave (??? like 10x or something) - TBH screw Mirelurk kings  
---
\- Swarm of Suitors Event (12-16x) - 50/50 if people are just gonna shoot you or not  
---
\- Pass the Buck Daily (9x) same location as SoS event but lower spawn levels   
---
\- South Mountain Outlook (5x+) out in the lake, may take some swimming to aggro them over to the shore...  
---
\- Mac's Farm (3-10x) - Hit or miss since you have to fight a Queen but her spawn count for easy kills  
---
\- Quarry X3  (3-10x) - Another guarantee Queen spawn with random spawn at the building which could be scorched/ferals/ or more mirelurks   
---
\- Sunrise Field (7-15x) - Kind of a shitshow but worth it if you want this task done fast on a high level/geared character  
---
**Wild Dogs**  
---
\- AaronHolt Homestead (6x) 2 in the courtyard, 1 in the nice house, 1 in barn, 2 by the small shack down the hill a little by the hay

\- Darling Sister's Lab (4-5x) short run SW from above, one dogo likes to get lost sometimes  
---
\- Between Overseer's Camp and Green Country Lodge (4x) on the road   
---
**Robots**  
---
\- Fertile Soil   
---
\- Mama Dolce's   
---
**Scorched**  
---
\- Sorry cant find them anywhere  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯   
---
\---------  
---
\* All but 3 of these are static spawns meaning they will always be there, Aint nobody got time for RNG  
---
\* Supermutant hounds have counted in the past for other challenges so they likely will count here  
---
\* I didn't try wolves because they have been 50/50 in the past for "dogs" for some reason. If wolves do count, then do Leader of the Pack Event for pretty easy 13x with bonus of a couple legendaries. Though I usually get attacked trying to do the event in survival so be aware of your surroundings.  
---
\* If you are desperate for Dogos: Lakeside cabins defense is fairly often a horde of mongrels and Appalachain Antiques has a chance of spawning like 7x in.   
---
\* Some quantities may vary due to human error
---
Unless you have a video of actual BS and you calling it I dont believe you 💩📞
---
It's part of the Easter egg hunt. HAHHAA
---
Anyone ever tell you that you got a name similar to that furry guy,
---
She's really not that hard
---
Would love me some combat support in those fights and would be a great way tie into factions where Brotherhood get vertibots and enclave we get some robots from the bots on parade mode.
---
Same here, annoying as hell.
---
We didn't get anything at all, no XP, no caps, no rewards. Killing the SBQ with a plasma weapon totally glitches her dying. First time I've experienced it and it really sucked.
---
This is even worse with survival mode. Like, i think, there is exactly one running at a time in my region at this time, after awhile i given up and raised my camp to be able to at least play at it.
---
(and standing naked in middle of pvp sever looking at this options feels so insecure)
---
Yes, for very good reasons.
---
AAE = just E. AA does nothing for E weapons.
---
Super duper doesn't stack with ammosmith
---
Personally I just take 1k 5mm ultracite. On average I go through 500 per fight, if I get players helping that have really good weapons and don’t slack off I might only use 250-300 firing the whole time. I don’t need much because the primed gatling fires slowly, but makes up for it in damage per shot. That’s why I chose it as my SBQ weapon.
---
For anyone else I recommend firing a full clip and timing it and the reload time, then dividing 30 minutes by the time it took. Multiply by the rounds you fired and round up to the nearest hundred for most weapons, round up to the nearest thousand for fast firing weapons like the minigun.
---
They’re not going to let people choose prefixes. That’s going to make it super easy to make god tier weapons. It’s going to be x amount for random weapon or armor.
---
I agree lots of whiners recently, been farming people that own workshop and a few of them report me and message me how I had my friend claim workshop and went to the location where they were at on map and killed them on the spots was mean, love farming easy targets.
---
Power user doubles your gatling laser clip?!
---
Yes, lvl 100 and I died quickly.  I purposely didn't read anything online to spoil the missions.  Didn't have a clue I was starting a raid boss for people to come join.  Power armor is like god mode in this game so I wander around without a care in the world.
---
Anyways others showed up and rezzed me.  So I just spent the time melee tanking it.  I had no clue what I was supposed to do and thought tanking it would save people from getting killed.
---
It worked I just spammed my stimpacks and we killed it after a bit.
---
I’ll help you transfer in exchange for caps and karma
---
Are you that furry guy?
---
Wow thats really messed up.
---
Goo pile never landed?
---
Sounds like a great way to keep the loot all to myself.
---
*flies to goo pile with jetpack*
---
Yes.
---
No problem!👍
---
Meanwhile I'm going to end up being a lone wanderer or chosen out of pity
---
"I saw it, and others have seen it" isn't proof, even if you believe it. That's not how this works.
---
If they followed that philosophy, Fallout 76 would've been sold through Steam. They want to cut out the middleman and gain more profit from their products
---
I believe in some cases you can still loot it.
---
If I’m not mistaken, the goo pile is missing a bottom texture. If you jetpack into the air it may be floating roughly near where it died.
---
Neat.
---
Super duper makes 200% of unmodified value. So from crafting 10 ammo you get 10+10+8=28.
---
if you control the ammo factory and have the smoke granades you can call them but don't know what the range is or how many would turn up
---
I never had decent drop from ghoul. Super mutants on the other hand....
---
I would fuck a gibus right now...
---
Unfortunately this is one of the events that  spawn randomly acrosse the Forest ( at random Spawn Points, like The Messenger events).
---
And _most_ unfortunately, If you need the stamen to craft super stimpacks, it's no use to do it  yourself, because  while _everybody else on your server_ has a chance to get this as a reward for you completing this event, you don't. 
---
I know, last point was not your concern, Just Had to vent, since I don't like this.
---
I never understood the origins of the word “incel” until I read your post.
---
Wait, so even if you saw it yourself, you wouldn't consider that proof.

\- Nuka Dark - Whitesprings Resort Soda Bar  
---
\- Hard Lemonade - Drink and Recipes can be bought from [Mr. Squeeze](https://youtu.be/FXSwR8FFBf0)  
---
Anything else must be either crafted yourself or obtained through other players. =/
---
They could implement account stash inventory. Shared to all characters, but not present in-game. Like, separate collection of raw hoarded stuff, accessed from main menu.
---
this solves a lot
---
- allows you to transfer things between characters without intermediaries, 
---
- things from the bank do not appear on the server and thus do not harm stability
---
- can use mobile application to manage stuff
---
Would be nice.
---
That covers the outfits.  How long have you been playing.
---
I feel your pain! Had two health glitched queens this week. Had to tell a low level random I invited to a team to help out that this just kind of happens sometimes, it was his first try at Scorched Earth too, poor lad!
---
Level 35, I wanted to experience all the Shear terror stuff before it was taken away, so I braved myself through overleveled territory to get to these sewers, annnnd it was nothing
---
40 ghouls, with like two instances of some higher leveled ones that tried to gang up on me, like 5 gutsy's and an easy boss battle of 2 gutsy's one robobrain and an assaultron... I got zero plans, some shrooms that I ate during the raid, 7 legendaries I couldn't use and an empty generator &amp; power armor chasis...
---
good guide
---
not like it matters much anymore
---
For ps4 Player its the same (L1)
---
Since launch, but just started getting in to it. I've had 3 characters but havent got to 50 yet on any and havent done many main quests.
---
300 is my base default for my 6 Charisma character. and if im only on long enough to sell, and short on grape mentats.
---
ive brewed up so many of them in attempts to sell them to players that i do not care so long as they are gone (5 of each leftover for player vending, no more 30 speed demon)
---
I get it sometimes, just gets stuck on the black screen with the little symbol at the bottom right
---
Explosive bullet turrets tickle.
---
Is it a three star because I also have one I use in my firefighter build
---
In X01? How do you stupidly regen your AP?
---
Yup this would be a good idea, the best legendary drop I've had is a lvl 35 Bloodied handmade rifle, and I weep for it's level. Still kicks ass, though.

My partner in crime and I both run bloody builds and so far, we've seen the most damage shaved off her using my 3* bloody minigun and, don't laugh, a 2* anti armor buzzblade with faster swing speed and a bloody buzzblade with faster swing speed. Standing at her head, we kept her stun locked for most of the fight and finished with 23 minutes left.
---
^I see what you did there XD
---
Thats really helpfull and confusing, thank you though. Im just curious about what other players want thats tradeable. Im just after base plans and helping people.
---
Thanks! I'll take you up on that one of these days when I have a bit more time to focus on the game.
---
Every drop of fuel you can find, then a backup weapon for when those 3 minutes are up.
---
Ordered two, because of the pure amount of awesomeness.
---
Ah it's honestly fine, my comment was about it's suitability for combat, it has less physical/energy resist than the military power armors
---
So we could ride bike but not take a screw or a gear off to repair our guns? 
---
Don't think that going to happen any time soon tbh
---
Except it won't purified for long once exposed to post-apocalyptic air.  Bethesda: my 2c worth is stop pandering, the game needs to be harder.
---
Or a lamb that chills in your bedroom with the New Zealand flag hanging over the bed.
---
You must work on your hand eye coordination
---
That mask wasn't part of the Fashnacht event. It's been in game since the Beta.
---
I can see the daily challenges for this already. “Take a photo, while intoxicated, of another person riding a bike through a radstorm 3 times”
---
Sometimes I run into mole rats that will *not* pop up for more than a split second. It's so aggravating trying to VATS them as quick as possible. Makes workshop attacks with them a pain in the ass and literally a game of whack-a-mole.
---
I'll take that iver what we have any day of the week.
---
is your comment relevant too?
---
Her health scales and if you dont have the damage output to match, you're dead in the water. I tried the event with a level 50 Gattling Plasma, a Bloodied Sledge Hammer, and about 8 other people. Apparently, we weren't trying hard enough because we only did 80% of her 150% health bar.
---
With the proper legendary prefix of furious they are OK. Otherwise they are hot garbage, as they cost more to make ammunition for than laser gear and the damage is underwhelming because of the split damage properties of doing ballistic and energy, with energy being a crutch.
---
They are better than they were at launch, but not really in a great spot. My Enclave Plasma Rifle does 33 ballistic and 30 energy damage, where as my Handmade does 95, neither are legendary.
---
some relationships 23 dollars can be the difference between getting to work or not asshole. sometimes people live in situtations and debts piling up. and entertainment is hard to justify. a good chunk of this countries population in relationships cant fucking justify spending 20 bucks cause they might not be able to fucking eat.
---
Bug has been around forever. Just carry a melee weapon so you can finish whatever you were doing before server hopping to clear it.
---
Never say never though. To be fair you cant get gears almost anywhere nowadays in 76, so stripping a bike for parts is just an option. Yes you could strip it for parts, but I would rather travel around on it than waste it
---
Can confirm
---
Perks: Lone wanderer, Action Boy
---
X-01 mods: Core Assembly for torso, Kinetic servos for legs.
---
Other perks: Grim Reaper's Sprint, Rejuvenated.
---
Most of the time i'm over the weight limit but that set-up allows me to keep on fighting without suffering. I can't sprint or fast travel, but considering that i spend most of my time in whitesprings i have no need for that. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2PQrqbthn4
---
There's a bit of my gameplay. All done while being 200 pounds over the weight limit. Just pay attention to my AP bar.
---
My loot loop is whitesprings, West tek, harpers ferry, general steak House, robco research centre, apalchia antiques, r&amp;g processing services. Then back to whitesprings by which time the mobs have respawned. Depnding on how many legendaries have spawned I either hop or repeat.
---
Yeah you 100% aren't stacking right,m. 30 minutes is more than enough time when groups including mine are able to kill her within 10 minutes.
---
Anti-armour perks. Damage perks. Drugs, Alcohol, bloodied/furious builds.
---
All you need to do is stand there an fight the mobs until she lands and then open her up.
---
Honestly don't know what to tell you at this point when hundreds are killing her within 10, heck our groups fastest run was 4:54. 
---
Learn to stack, stop inviting level 50's who if they're not on alt's they're clearly unprepared
---
Unfortunately  humans have a bias towards seeing patterns where no patterns exits.  It is bullshit, it's astrology level bullshit.
---
We need a mole rat mutation.
---
thats fucking awesome man!
---
I'm guessing the quest line will go something like this:
---
●find the frame - the overseer made it, so you have to go to her camp to get it.
---
●find the gears - the gears forth bike arent like normal gears, as they are gears similar to that a sentry bot uses. You need to find and kill a certain sentry bot to get the bike gears.
---
●find the wheels - again relatively straightforward. These could be found in a shed somewhere
---
●assemble the bike
---
Done, and if you want a tandem bike, you have to kill two sentry bots to get the gears
---
Still looking? I got a spare Junkie's explosive assault rifle and well loads of tier 2 weapons really.
---
I, too, am wondering about the difference in overall damage/effect of plasma vs pulse grenades on robots. You'd think the plasma grenade would be better since it lists more total energy damage, over pulse. But, I swear pulse seems to be the more deadly of the two when you just watch the effect it has on robots. Could be my imagination.
---
I also wonder, given how easily you find plasma nades, and how rare it is to find pulse, does this mean the game is trying to tell us pulse may be more valuable? Although, you can craft pulse nades, whereas you cannot plasma. I don't know if this means anything, in terms of hints within the game's loot design.
---
That’s what I thought too! Haha
---
Hell if you supplied me enough violet flux i could solo her for you when she lands, take upwards of 10 minutes but 100% can do it
---
I suppose this helps folks who haven’t gotten that mask yet, though it has been there since the game came out
---
They really need to upgrade trade UI. Like, there should be implicit indication of items given and what emote you should be given back.
---
Awesome man, should make a youtube channel around it, where you visit and recreate Fallout poses an locations IRL. I reckon you could garner a following doing that
---
I still don’t have the plans for anything other than the excavator! How do I get any of the others?
---
(music plays), 
---
Hi I'm Johnny Knoxville and this is rocket bike, basically my friend is in the silo ready to launch the nuke and I'm sitting on the silo lid on my bicycle to see if I can ride it into space.
---
 (Explosion) bicycle and rider hanging mangled from a tree, everyone else jumping round laughing their ass off.
---
The Mothman and the Flatwoods Monster are very real "cryptids"/folklore in West Virginia. Same with the Grafton Monster and the Sheepsquatch.
---
***Doomguy wants to know your location***
---
Dun dadun dun dun, dadadada
---
It struck me too that the time was wrong considering we actually got to midnight. But you know, Bethesda has to have something (anything) to do to procrastinate from fixing bugs. Technically inaccurate doomsday clocks and shiny skins are just that.
---
*walks off humming Iron Maiden*
---
You're not far off. Coal mine pollution is still a serious problem.
---
I bought mine from a vendor which I assume was sold by another player or something
---
The possibilities are endless! We could make BMX parks in our camps and have races around Appalachia. We could use melee weapons whilst on our bike so that we can hit enemies.
---
You know for a fact if it was bright pink with shiny tassles on the handlebars and a little shopping basket at the front - but increased carry weight by 20- you'd see the biggest baddest players on the server riding around on them
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:_Assault_Rifle
---
Does it make you go through the rigamarole of finding the password to the terminal every time? Does that for me and it’s super annoying so I just gave up.
---
For real. The bike basket could act as a mini portable stash
---
That looks like a blast (pun intended)!  Seriously, nice job on the photography and appearing "in character."  I enjoyed looking at the pics.
---
Awwwwwwwwww. Now I want it.
---
This has been an issue since launch. I thankfully have not encountered it personally.
---
I haven't invited a single person, and my hammers both broke upon beating her face in for a solid 10 minutes. No, I was not attacking her while invincible, and no, I wasn't running a bad build. I went full bloodied build, and she just wouldn't die. 
---
A full plasma core drained about 5% of her health and considering how I went through about 10, that means that I did about 50-60% of the 80% damage dealt.
---
That means that between the about 8 other players present, they dealt 30% of the damage. 
---
I dont need to learn how to fight the SBQ better, I'm already running a build that can one shot death claws and about three shot scorch beasts, I need more gunpower, even then.
---
What do you use violet flux for anyway? I collected a bunch of it and dont know what to use it for.
---
How would the mechanics of a vehicle work though? Would you have added armour? 
---
Could you be wearing power armour and be riding a little pink bike? 
---
Could monsters knock you off the bike? Would that cause damage? 
---
Can I shoot out your tyres? Would you need to repair them with rubber and glue? 
---
I'm just spitballing ideas here dude, let's hash this out and get it concepted
---
Ultracite .50 ammo. Ultracite destroys scorched beasts and the SBQ. It's what Ultracite rounds exist for, though they're a pain to make
---
This must be the post-apocalyptic version of those ladies with the purse pooches.  "Can you give my little Foo Foo a trim, too?"
---
Awesome! Nice job with the poses and the outfit too.
---
thanks man
---
I’d buy that for a dollar!
---
Ill buy the decontamination plans? Dm me or on xbox live: niceguytall
---
Got em
---
To put it into perspective with my build fully done, without drugs etc just my perks my 50 cal machine gun can scale to 600 damage per shot, cater that in with penetration perks and ultracite ammo the SBQ doesn't last long. Have 3 of us doing that an we 3 can kill her in 8 minutes despite low levels being present
---
Power armour cannot be used on the bike as it's too heavy. (Maybe motorbikes could do that? Idk).
---
Monsters have a small chance to knock you off the bike, but only if they are melee enemies. Enemies with guns can still shoot you.
---
Enemies can also shoot the tyres, but they are more likely to shoot you instead.
---
The tyres will wear down after prolonged use. Riding on grass and paths is ok, but riding along gravel surfaces will wear the tyres down faster (they already have sounds for certain textures when we walk on them, so they could incorporate this into the bikes but base it on durability instead)
---
This one's was amazing :) good job!
---
Don’t forget the snallygaster!
---
&gt; I'd wager Bethesda wanted this.
---
Yep. They explicitly said so in a  recent interview. It's a recent panel discussion on Beth's youtube channel. He said their entire reason for letting people use existing characters in survival was to see how badly they could break the game with extreme builds and legendary armor, so that it could be fixed.
---
This is one of the most awesome things I’ve seen on here!
---
Level 209, damn Calibrated left leg on my excavator ran off on me again 3 days ago. Same piece as last time I lost an item randomly two months ago. While it is a mild inconvenience for me now, I remember how much it sucked for lower level me in the past. If anyone has any footage or details surrounding their case please either post here or send in a ticket.   
---
Details:  
---
\- Died at Encryptid event, someone took my bag  
---
\- Event failed  
---
\- Noticed carry weight was wrong and had to Radant lager to fast travel away because of weight, figured it was my right leg broke and I had lost my bonus  
---
\- Fast travel to camp  
---
\- Realize my left leg is just straight up missing, not the near broken one.  
---
\- Tried to hit -5Min record for Shadowplay, as usual it errors out so no footage to try and figure this bug out... ;-;
---
Not a single one but thanks
---
No idea why people are down voting this but it's a real thing that needs to be addressed. I guess they are hoping to find out the hard way sadly. Oh well.
---
nice, i have never seen one at a vendor before
---
thats all i am trying to do, i know a few people who dont have a mask yet, plus there are many new people to the game who missed the parade so this will give them the opportunity to have one
---
my bad i did not realise, nevermind, hopefully still helps some people
---
Can you disable getting messages from random players? I would hate that.
---
There’s some at grafton steel , wade airport and the ammo factory
---
&gt;Wait...West Virginia's a real place?
---
Bethesda had it built as part of the ARG for the marketing push.
---
How will we tell the ghouls from the locals?
---
Yeah I have a vampire explosive Gatling gun and the effects are exactly how I want them but it's level 40.
---
This is awesome!  You really did a wonderful job...and so talented 😁
---
Your dedication to the pics is much appreciated.
---
Fake. The trading UI is simply trash and I too would drop trade as it was easier
---
I hope it doesn’t slow the server more or crash more ect
---
We need Moira and her repellent!
---
I had a melee/shotgun build but then I found a max lvl bloodied explosive handmade from a ghoul and switched to that. I'm now lvl 121\[PC\] and it's gonna be another 18 levels until I finish my build but I am really loving my build with this beastly weapon.
---
I pretty much 1 hit every normal high level enemy and I deal most of the damage during the SBQ and sheepsquatch events and I haven't even nearly maxed out my damage dealing and damage resistance perks.
---
Addmy Bloodied pump action and bloodied powerfist I also picked up in the same hour I got the handmade... and I get tons of fun. Especially with the powerfist.
---
  Currently my perks and armour aren't the best too so being so low health at the same time adds a certain amount of difficulty, too. I find it very fun. Although, I can't say how it is in PvP since I don't PvP.
---
Yes, those who make for good stories and interesting universe. I would take them anytime instead of just robots and tapes.  
---
The old school Private Eye was probably the best one imo.
---
I've got 5 if it's not showing restart the game and look again
---
Um... it’s a suspension maybe you should look up the difference
---
Fake. The trading UI is trash and buggy
---
Hopefully we have the Fasnacht event again next year so people can get their hands on the other masks
---
What a narrow minded asshat. You must be fun at parties😂you can literally make multiple characters... if he wants to play them on separate Xbox’s at once he can. *Communism detected* from you sir
---
Punctuation is a thing.
---
Please find. Want see. Thank.
---
I’m pretty sure I have a single mod, will message you tomorrow if you like.
---
Yeah yeah yeah
---
The t-xx versions can't be unlocked, however if you continue with the main story, completing the Brotherhood of Steel quests and onto the next faction, you will find yourself unlocking plans for the ultracite and x-01 armors.
---
The downside to the mutation would just be how annoying you are to friends and teammates.
---
Yeah, they're unarmed.
---
Technically, theoretically, anything you build in a workshop stays for, I believe it was 10 days, I can't remember where that info comes from, so salt.
---
This does assume the server stays running, and doesn't shut down for maintenance, which they do regularly, more regularly than the limit on how long things last, and the fact there are a lot of servers, one for every 24 players at a minimum, meaning for 960 players you are looking at well over 40 servers, and more likely something like 60 given worlds aren't always going to be full. So the odds of seeing anything you built again after a day are slim, if it doesn't get bulldozed by world maintenance.
---
never drop, always deploy
---
Impressive!
---
I thought it was common knowledge that punching weapons are listed as "Unarmed" melee weapons
---
What of the dodge perks that save you at low health.
---
I always deploy but I was trying to get rid of a extra frame
---
It does not do so consistently - I've done testing with off-team friends. It's bugged beyond just people crouching.
---
Bloody fantastic, I love people taking the time to recreate these excellent scenes.
---
I’m also laughing at the self important misery guts commenting on IMGUR wondering if they are not playing Fallout 76,  or have never played Fallout 76 why they even bother to hunt out such posts to sh*t on. What can they possibly gain more than just moving on to something they actually enjoy?
---
I’m literally LOL 😂
---
See. I thought "unarmed" meant unarmed. All this time I could've used the Bear arms perk that came in a pack I earned a while back.
---
Your missing the purple ish one
---
Sadly i think mods have been broken
---
Buying tomorrow, thank you for printing these up, and all the art and time invested!
---
The rule of thumb for fallout is, if your character punches (or swipes) with the weapon, its unarmed. if they swing its one or two handed
---
&gt;Currently right now the Burrows is the best for the amount of legendary drops, although they are all 1 star  
---
  
---
This is wrong as Ive had a 3 star spawn in there the 1 time ive been through there
---
I've been holding onto them, because I thought they fit my build. I have a Tambo and a Death Claw Gauntlet that are Mutant Slayer. I got bear arms in a card pack a while back, and I've never used it, because I thought it literally meant unarmed.
---
I ended up tearing the whole thing down. I really liked the structure I made, but it was just too big. I used up way too much of building budget on the building and couldn't afford to build all the cool stuff inside I wanted. Too much empty space.
---
Have the Heavy Sharp Rocket and Searing Heavy Sharp Rocket mods. Latter is the best mod in my view. Any use?
---
It worked flawlessly for me and the two people I showed how to do later.
---
Can someone else tell him.
---
seeing how it takes your blip of the normal mode map too, id def say this is it.
---
Yes! Those rad rats are fucking nuts
---
The first time I did it everything worked fine except for the part “scoot” comes out. I read the last note and nothing happened.
---
Agree! 
---
Grasshoppers are insane damage!
---
im willing to try them but im pretty sure mods have been broken for a while :(
---
Well how much would a VE or an AAE be worth then?
---
if i have a spare Chassis i scrap it. last time i did each PA piece was dumped into my inventory.
---
As a Washington DC resident, I should do Fallout 3 like this.
---
Can you redo the quest or are you doing it on another character?
---
that would be brilliant, i would see no problem with them doing it again
---
225 ok for them?
---
the meat hook is affected by both unarmed and one handed perks
---
The quest doesn’t start over for me. It just says look inside the sunken church for scoot
---
I love when people do this so much! Thank you for sharing
---
if they work ill gladly pay for them.
---
Iron fist is the perk for unarmed melees
---
Raider traders sell them I’m almost positive, I don’t use the raider so I don’t look but I’m sure they do
---
Yes PSN austin1300gt
---
mines the same as here. ill pay you 500 if they work but are you ok with a refund policy since mods are kind of broken? like most mods you cant apply.. at all.
---
I was just at Pleasant Valley Ski Resort and the vendor not has them there, they're pricey as fuck though!
---
dunno if you got my FR since it seems your psn is on private
---
They will work. I’ve used them. Bethesda will fix this issue so you will be able to use. I’m not sure there are plans out there so may be the only way to do. My price is fair I think.
---
They're fucking tanks! And the noises they make along with the molerats are hella annoying. Not as bad as the spammy Mirelurk Kings though. Fuck them and whoever did the sound design for them at Beth.
---
Do you scrap them at a power armor station, and I just wish they stayed on the frame
---
thats true, yeah ill buy em.
---
and there are plans, i know that the one im looking for has a chance to drop from some daily events, but them being daily i cant farm them reliably.
---
Alright thank you, I'm a building a smithing character so I'm trying to learn how to build everything I can in the game
---
So how exactly does it hurt you if they increase the stash size or make it easier to transfer between characters?  If you don’t want to use a feature that’s fine, we’re just asking for improvements to the game that a lot of players would like.
---
I actually talked her into buying a bunch of stuff from the Blizzard sale lol.
---
I lost some stuff a couple of days ago doing that lol. The guy I was using as anchor switch chars about the same time as I did. I probably should have messaged though to be fair. I normally use my brother's account to do it which is a little less risky.
---
Just logging in now
---
Your overall stash size effects the fucking server.  For all you people that don't seem to understand this extremely simple fact, it IS true!  The more items people hold or have in stashes effects the overall server! If you're too STUPID to get this, it's understandable, since people KEEP asking for this, even though there are explanations for it ALL OVER THE NET!  Dude, seriously, just figure out your fucking item management, Jesus, you must be a fucking hoarder irl!  Fuck!!
---
The game won't be around or at least officially supported in 5 years
---
That’s a fair point
---
ESAD
---
Make sure you're not over encumbered.
---
I’m sure they’ll budget the items you can place accordingly. :)
---
Nah, have an Easter egg.
---
I would be very surprised if it wasn't a harder mode. Not a simple easy/normal/hard mode difficulty selection thing of course, but whatever it entails I'd put money on it being more difficult.
---
The vault Tec agricultural research center is good for robots
---
As fair as I can tell, they never made any comment on it after the backlash.
---
If they did, can someone chuck me a source.
---
In Big Freds BBQ Shack is a olotape and also a hidden quest for one of these mounted heads for wall decoration. The Holotape is about some crazy guy who stalks some people near his shack. When you go down to said campers there are corpses of people who got killed by these quills. Could be the guy who became a cryptid? Or just some random serial killer. But that doesnt explain the fresh dead brahmin.
---
Build camp with stairs, but anyway this is fucking bug like milion others that make this game anoying......
---
That explains the massive increase in the marine tacticals I've seen in shops since the update.
---
Not  sure if you can craft mutation serum, but now they can be sold to vendors for over 400 caps each, there not a bad option
---
Oh now i want to see this
---
What do you win by repairing your weapons or armor?
---
Intra-Mail on Terminals would also be a good idea for leaving a message for players who are offline.
---
Happens because there are like 100 players per every system, no servers to chose from, enjoy.

Be happy when they teleport. So many times i had danger for few minutes till i found her. U can't lose those bastards. Thank god, there is so low numbers of radscorpions, they are creatures from hell.
---
When looking at a written date, for me it's more logical to see day-month-year. As for saying the date, that depends on your language. English usually has month-day ("April 20th" ), as it's shorter than "20th of April" and puts stuff into perspective immediately when you say month first. But that's very English-specific. There are plenty of languages where even spoken date has day-month format (like my native language) and trying to say month first sounds weird and unnatural or there isn't even a structure that can allow you to say it correctly with month first.
---
The Lord’s work.

Stealth, I'm not sure why that happens either. Seems to happen each time I do it after an initial minute or so of it draining me. I have healing factor (mutation), ghoulish, radsponge, sunkissed... not sure if the game gets confused and activates healing
---
Sweet
---
Absolutely fantastic, great work capturing all that
---
Fallout math will never cease to amaze me
---
Cool, i invited guy, because i came to his camp and he has missing walls. After he accepted i build 3 of them and before i switched on roof he leaved. Like why? If i wanted to destroy that place i would be already done.
---
Do you know what also works the best? A bloodied ripper! It have maxed out at 150 damage for me once and it’s insane
---
Damn that is insane! I'll keep that in mind if I ever come across one.
---
If you put on weapon artisan in the intelligence, and repair it to 200, the damage goes up significantly.
---
Awesome, yeah it sucks when people don't know whats going on
---
Yeah thats just normal though eh, lol
---
"Don't use your preferred weapon because the game is a buggy mess."

that sucks

Is this a reference to something. I’m sorry. (Please don’t r/woooosh me 😂
---
Im sure this was patched out quite early on, must have gotten re-added at some point
---
They are really missing the mark in the atomic shop. Even worse now that they have taken some of the coolest items out.  I doubt that many Fallout players want Easter dresses. We want cool looking mad max shit. We want more weapon skins like the Lever action got. not lame ass golden "call of duty" skins, and tuxedos. what a shame.
---
The damage bug usually happens when there are creatures of different factions around. The easiest way to reproduce this is by going to the Generals Steakhouse and kiting a Scorchbeast from one of the nearby fissure sites there. Sometimes, not all the time, mind you, when the Mutants engage the Scorchbeast you are seeing their damage go down only to go back up the moment you hit them. Same for the Scorchbeast. Heck, sometimes it's enough to have ants spawn in the small garden at the Steakhouse. Mutants fight them, you try to pick off everything that's around, health of whatever you hit goes down and right back up.
---
This works with most enemies in pretty much all locations but it's more noticable with creatures that have a high health pool and as such need multiple hits to go down. I've yet to figure out why this only happens sometimes and not all the time, though. It's entirely possible that the engine has issues tracking and calculating the damage done to different creatures at the same time and, quite frankly, it wouldn't surprise me one bit.
---
Legendaries regenerate health, so that might be what you are encountering. The damage bug is different from this as the health of your victim ain't going back up all the way.
---
I only attack lower level players if they start attacking me first. Unless they’re below level 40. If they’re below level 40 I just fast travel away.
---
Yes please. I feel like looking cute and snazzy would NOT offer me the kind of advantages I'd want in the post apocalypse...

Mid to late May is when they were supposedly going to implement them.
---
Is a handmade without a stock with an auto receiver an auto pistol?
---
You win by the fact it can put you far ahead of everyone else who need to grind for mats to repair and leave to go repair they can just repair on the go keep farming nuke zones or defend junkyards
---
I never understood why so much of fallout is so old school. The bombs fell in our future. That means they’d have been more advanced than us. Only the odd collector would have the radios they use or televisions that look the way they do. The cars are meh. The clothes make no sense. It’s weird.
---
What about looking funky
---
I can appreciate the "snazzy" stuff too, our characters are new to the apocalypse and is still trying to bring back the old world after all. But to be honest my favourite thing from the Atom Store so far have been the Bone Raider skin for the Excavator. That felt very wasteland. My character might try to build his home to look like the old world, but I am not going into the world looking like a some rich boy punk. When I walk among the wasteland I want to look intimidating!
---
Awesomeness 😍
---
I've just had another look (trying to find a different plan) but it seems they're actually raider armour mods, not actual frame plans bud, sorry!
---
Happened to me too. Lost a power armour helmet
---
If you have the means to acquire flux and at least 1 serum recipe, you easily clean out the vendors because of the shared cap pool. One trip into a nuke zone with green thumb and you can easily get 10+ stable flux. Craft serum with super duper and it's plenty to clean out the vendors for 3-4 days. Or if you have alts you can give them the serum as well and get multiple times the daily cap limit. Conveniently, if you have 1 Charisma and no perks, you can take a grape mentats and sell serum for 350 caps, which is exactly 1/4 the vendor limit. Even if you buy the materials in bulk on discord channels you can make easy profit.
---
If you have rare costume plans you can do a similar thing, but I've never found any so I can't speak to the amount of material farming required.
---
It's cool, thanks alot
---
You aren't incorrect, but maybe try not being an asshole about it.
---
It's pretty amazing how they're still managing to piss the fans off like this huh, lol
---
How do these things get missed? All bug testers had to do was use an insta kill cheat with a plasma or laser weapon and kill some scorchbeasts. Just incompetent.
---
AnD that sucks but I bet it looked cool as it disintegrated in mid air. If you’ve been through the silo a few times before and have a competed build with a good weapon to complement it you can solo the silos in 10 minutes or so, do it on a server where there’s a good 10-12 players over level 120 and just do them back to back. It’s what I did to farm all the prime receiver plans. Just don’t do it for legendaries, that’s a waste of time.
---
They’re very irritating. I usually just ignore them and let them die to my mutations but getting pushed around by a wimpy rat is pretty annoying too. If I got rid of my mutations and put a medic pump on my PA torso they’d push me from Wavy Willard’s to Watoga.
---
Whack-a-mole. Now I get it.
---
Foolie! I like oatmeal! Haha.
---
Yes. It happens either with weightless armor or without.
---
The thing is, it's your word vs bethesda.
---
We have people who did the same thing, crafted over 100k ultracite ammo in under 4 weeks. They didn't get banned.
---
Meanwhile you did... 
---
I know that people love to throw shit at bethesda but when they ban someone isn't because they want to be mean, it's because they have enough proof to do so. 
---
Hearsay is usually useless even in a court. The judge only cares about real evidence. They had enough evidence to ban you. Get over it.
---
Wow these are amazing, thank you for them and sharing them, very cool!!
---
i'm at 1600 hours and yet to witness it either
---
I ignore the weak ones until they die to my mutations. The high levels that take too long to die to my mutations get gun bashed to death. Both worth the bullets.
---
I've been server hopping all day and nothing but t60 and raider armor. It's like the system knows what I want and is making me work hard for it! Fml
---
Seriously, mole rats are just a minor annoyance. Radscorpsions are pure evil in comparison.
---
*Cries in Mirelurk King*
---
Exactly. You don’t just post about your emotional and life issues on the internet without expecting some kind of validation from people.
---
Its not a bug, the atom just doesn't refresh until you restart your game
---
Awesome work! You should check out Dolly Sods, it’s one of my absolute favorite places in West Virginia. I’m not high enough level to try to go there in game so I don’t know how accurate it is, but in real life it is stunning.
---
I have a microphone, so even if the other person doesn't I can just have em yes/no for a good enough solution.
---
I can't for the life of me find what I need. It's t51 and I have been farming server hopping several locations since 5 pm yesterday. Officially been on 25 hours straight and no luck. Sucks..
---
Pacifist mode only makes it so you don't do damage to other players, and subsequently don't accidentally start PvP if someone jumps infront of your gun. Plain and simple you don't do damage to other players, but other players can damage you if you engage in PvP knowingly or unknowingly. 
---
If you or anyone else in your group claims a workshop then you are submitting to PvP even though you will do no damage to other players with pacifist mode on. A player or group of players can contest the workshop and kill you anywhere on the map.
---
This must have been some inside internet buff reference that my grey bearded ass didn't understand.
---
I'm not well enough to play games every day. Most people who have jobs and families probably can't either. All of these kinds of ploys and limited time items piss me off.
---
What kind of junk and ammo are you selling
---
That’s exactly what I was thinking. Now he’s gonna try to once again to convince people to pressure Bethesda to unban him.
---
Repair it beyond 100 percent with weapon artisan and the damage will jump
---
Basically everything, I don’t have plasma cores though.
---
It’s an alternate universe . They prioritized atomic research , we prioritized flat screen TVs.
---
I’m sorry I don’t know this joke, r/woooosh
---
He already received a lot of attention, I've seen community managers asking him to pm them with the ticket number, there were even articles and youtube videos about it. 
---
I'm convinced that Bethesda checked and rechecked his case and they still decided that the ban must stay...
---
Eh, depends. My mind always goes to whether outfits would actually be practical/functional (yes, I'm one of those - sorry!), so I wish they'd make some cool ones that don't look like something only an idiot or suicidal maniac would wear out in the wasteland. I'd get wanting to look nice if we had something like an established settlement to hang out in though, that would be pretty cool.
---
Quad explosives are going for 12-20 so somewhere in that range
---
Do you have 556 shotgun 5mm? Acid, lead, plastic, or coal?
---
i couldnt see the egg after starting the game yesterday. i was not ingame when the new egg arrived. i was ingame later and couldnt see an egg.
---
They've been making forward progress since the catastrophic launch. The free content has been nice. The bugs that have been introduced / reintroduced knock them back a bit.
---
So two steps forward, one step back. At this rate, the game may be in a good position for your average consumer by Christmas. Not just those of us immunised to Bethesda's particular brand of sloppy sewage run off.
---
I’m sorry, but I still don’t believe you. It’s your word against Bethesda’s. After all the attention your previous posts got; don’t you think Bethesda would’ve unbanned you if this truly was one big misunderstanding?
---
Yeah, me too!
---
You can, the recipes are about 28,000 caps with no perks though. However all serums need stable flux so not part of this challenge.
---
It also happens if someone on your team attacks someone
---
Ugh you lost my respect when admitting you committed suicide. I’d say any game mode that scares you into “I CANT HANDLE THIS. MUST KILL MYSELF” is working on some level. 
---
The leaderboards should look like we’re all chasing each other or raving to the top and with longest life it did that much better across the board than what’s happening now with most kills.
---
I agree that most enemy kills leaderboards should be a fun variant. I’m glad they are trying out different things.
---
Now that I believe.
---
Yes sir, thank you for catching that.
---
Ok I've not realised this, so iron fist and Bear hands? Are they the only two? That's 9 level up points I've wasted on gladiator perks then haha.
---
Yes it’s much more stable and enjoyable
---
Buy them off other players for200caps then resell to vendor - still make over 200caps serum.
---
Congrats! Yeah, that's the vendor price. Remember that that vendor bot sells other unique outfits as well, like the Winter Jacket, a few Fisherman's and the Longshoreman outfits, plus the Clean Spacesuit and Helmet.
---
Yeah, for us it's the same, it's since the last patch ( who introduce Lowe quests serie ) , absolutly sure about it.
---
I’m going to sound like a broken record. But that’s exactly what I think as well. With how much attention he got, Bethesda had to have looked into this. If they banned him unfairly, I’m pretty sure they would’ve lifted the ban by now.
---
Yes. It’s not perfect but it’s good.
---
I love this idea! 😃👍
---
It's better. It's still bug / glitch central. You'll be encounting them every few minutes. But it is slowly moving in the right direction.
---
Some of the launch issues have definitely been addressed.
---
So this is why people like them? Because you bump up the attack even more?
---
Like deleted phenomenon.
---
You can't lump Explosive damage with Two-Shot, as they are two separate legendary effects. You can have Blooded Explosive or Furious Explosive or Anti-Armour Explosive. All will outperform Two-Shot Explosive.
---
source?
---
West Tek is also good for caps. I did two runs got 9 legendaries  and about 200 caps from just looting the supermutents. Than I sold all the weapons that I looted from them and got about 1200 caps. 10 minutes per run. So about 1500 caps in 20 minutes if you sell the legendaries. 
---
If you are running an very good and fast killing build than you would be even faster.
---
good job man!
---
I really hope they increase the camp budget when this get implemented. Even if only a little bit.
---
Well i'm either assuming you re the same guy who posted the idea on the Bethesda Fallout 76 forum or a guy who carried the idea here after seeing it. That aside, it still would be a nice feature. Would probably get carried away and send magazines to my buddies and burnt comics just to mess with them.
---
Who's winning though. We get to play a game about their universe on our flat screens, doubt they can play a game about our universe now.
---
Tranquillity Lane disagrees.
---
I fucking knew it had to be you when I saw "Preyfar" in the Mire a while back.
---
if youre missing more than 25% or so of your health bloodied makes your melee weapon do more damage than it would normally.
---
meaning since youre always in the fight taking some damage, most of the time youll be getting a massive damage boost. i run a bloodied power fist and it one hits every non boss mob.
---
From what I've heard, only the first shot gains any damage bonuses. 
---
The second shot just does 25% of the weapons base damage.
---
Can't confirm personally though.
---
Me too, every so often i use barbed BB bat with a red bandana with greaser jeans an jacket and follow people for a lil bit.
---
Other times i'll play Survival an poke someone constantly with a weak silent weapon an watch them panic. One dude was a level 173, and ran into a room in whitesprings and logged off lol.
---
I bumped into 2 camps yesterday on survival near each other but not enough to be aware, i shit the turrets of on one, the dude came out and was looking for me so i came out if chameleon so he would see me, i run to the other dudes base, i crouch - he thinks it was his base an they fought lol.
---
I know, i'm a fiend.
---
What about broccolate milk?
---
Phew, almost thought you nuked the virginia area
---
Have not noticed this, but if you want to mutate, there is a nuclear waste dump between West-tek and Whitesprings, that has some barrels and a rad shower right beside them, just inside the dungeon area - saves you having to use radaway at the pylon. Just be careful with perk card swapping : )
---
Love when people do this. World be cool to have a fallout in my area, a game.
---
Well I mean I am in Chicago area so...
---
So basically you can farm those...
---
I have 500 5.56, I have 2238 5mm, 3000 shotgun, 14 bulk acid, no coal, 300 plastic, and 100 lead. 
---
No much, but I have been selling so of them. Let me know if you want any
---
yep. This would be a Major design feature. not something that they could add on the fly. I would settle for a way to save them independent of the games save file. This way you could view your pics outside of the game, and not lose them if you uninstall the game.
---
Oh! Like tired of hearing this should be in the game like "hey they should put your face in the game dummy." I'm still playing the old man card for being slow. Haha!
---
Cause offense is the best defense. First star, as you call it, can have the most powerful effect, but is wasted on Suppressor's.
---
Awesome writing
---
And flat screen tvs didn’t lead to nuclear fallout but we are more than capable of that
---
I've seen this LOADS of times! It happens every now an again for me when an enemy has an incorrect name/skin. One time in whitesprings we had eyebots that were ghouls as they were doing rad damage when they "shot" us but they would only "shoot" us when they got a point blank range (ghoul melee)
---
Another time we had Ghouls that were dropping lead/steel/aluminum an were exploding on death
---
It's called branding. For example, you can buy $300 branded bag when you can buy 5 @ $60 at comparable quality. Depending on the person, they may not have comparable value. So branding is important because this is fallout game with lots of fans.
---
I'll give 2500 for all of it
---
Yea sure, I’m on right now.
---
Add me: The_Pete_Jones
---
My psn is gofukyurslf326 I can buy from you now
---
What bugs or glitches do you encounter? I’ve had this game since it launched and I never encounter bugs or glitches
---
This is awesome.   I went to Camden Park last year so I could go there in game and say I had actually been there.   I live in WV and been to most of the other places irl and also in game.   Great job with the recreations.
---
I'm fairly certain in the plasma/laser weapons case it's either one or the other. The reason why it works this way on some pipe weapons is because the `WeaponTypePistol` keyword is embedded in the weapon [directly](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/488962727293747210/569486102331654154/unknown.png) *as well* as the [standard pistol grip](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/488962727293747210/569486414278950932/unknown.png).
---
Laser/Plasma weapons don't have the keyword embedded directly on them ([laser for example](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/488962727293747210/569475644644392960/unknown.png)), instead it is [added via the grip](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/488962727293747210/569475762818777098/unknown.png), which is removed when the [rifle grip](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/488962727293747210/569475964371861504/unknown.png) is applied.
---
Joining you now
---
It's at least a Nod to it.
---
I've discovered that if you need caps, don't break items down before selling them to the vendors.  I will loot EVERYTHING from an area (a la #trashtag) and drag my butt to the nearest vendor.  Yesterday I cleaned up with more than 400 caps just from cleaning out a town.
---
(Previous to this, I was always breaking stuff down but was only able to sell certain junk materials and having to drop the rest.)
---
I mean everyone can live their life how they choose, but "Talked my **Partner** into **letting**  spend money for my hobby" doesnt seem like a good relationship to me.
---
Its not like the game would be super expensive or that gaming in general would be super expensive, so why would have you to talk your partner into **letting** you buy something you like?
---
Atleast in my book, you should be able to spend your money how you like as long as you arent unreasonable and can pay your fixed and variable living costs.
---
Ayyyy
---
I have a full set of unyielding sentinel so no one can say I'm to poor to afford good armor . fact of the matter is sentinel and cavalier need to be reduced from 15 down to at least 10 percent, all of the arguments against it are from people who were lucky enough to buy their sets off dupers . they say things like " oh well there's a Small handful of counters to it like vats crits and staggering git gud scrub" that's not the point most players who don't have that gear will still lose against it 80 percent of the time even while trying to employ this tactics .it needs to be toned down, normal armor shouldn't be much stronger than power armor it makes no sense
---
I was also kinda surprised that so far everything was low effort stuff. Maybe they should name it Automatro.... oh wait, even that dlc had a human character.
---
Their initial 'story'-design really just ruined any chance of delivering something else than robots unless the vault raids finally have human characters.
---
Why would u actually down rl money in the atom shop? Just get what you REALLY like and you will have plenty left over FREE ATOMS
---
&gt;I wouldn't want to spend £50 without my partners say-so.
---
I mean everyone should live their live how they like, but what the fuck?
---
Its a hobby and €/$50 is not that much if you get dont games for that price like twice a week or something. Its good if you talk about money, but everyone should be able to spend their money, or their share of the money if you have a shared account, for their hobbies of their choosing...
---
It sounds awfully complicated to ask for permission to anything and not really like a loving relationship.
---
I'm playing currently. In the last five minutes I've had liberators, but their over head name tags are 'mole rats', distance textures with bugged out lighting, I'm currently in the Savage Divide and the ground in the distance is a super light green. (Though in the past few days I've had them not load at all and the ground is bright placeholder textures.) Multiple V.A.T.S hits in a row not registering and of course the hilariously broken animation for leaving power armour, that often leaves your power armour floating in the air.
---
This was literally just the last 5 minutes of game time.
---
Truth
---
In the infamous words of Salt N Peppa, "the moral of the story is, there's only one true judge and that's god.  So chill and let my father do his job."
---
 I've noticed the groupthink, but I like to think for myself.  And while I'm not religious, those 90's queens knew what was up.
---
Mwuahahahahaha
---
Every single day this is posted. Every day it is explained why this can not be.
---
Exactly!  We don't eat out a lot, and we have a good budget so it is what it is.  Wasteland dates every night vs a movie once a month?  I pick fallout!
---
Nope, I'm talking about the newest update that uses SFE, it works just like the old mod where you can save any perk loudout you've got equipped by pressing shift+ a number to save that loadout. 
---
Here check the updated info at the bottom of the main page:  https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124
---
I enjoyed your story - very good written :]
---
&gt;My wife and I solve this by having separate accounts.
---
Personally, i think that is the best option, it gives each party indipendence over their money and if you in addition have a shared account for your living costs and stuff its like the ideal situation for all.
---
I could never live with just one blob of money for me and my fiance, i love her and i trust her, but financial indipendence and non-reliance on "permission" to use money for hobbies or small stuff i like is integral to happiness in my opinion. Otherwise it would feel like an allowance and why would one party be the deciding factor for what is allowed and what isnt?
---
Doesnt seem that nice to me :/
---
i do this, then when i get a giant pile i sneak around inside and collect. One time so far after patch 7? i had one come through the window but i think it was only because too many were there.
---
Yeah i was thinking about it aswell. It would be nice to create vehicels and mod them, adding Paints and weapons.
---
Theres alot of things i would add in the game like dual wielding,  robot workbenches, the ability to merge your camp with other players camps,... 
---
  I am not hoping for it though because stuff  requires alot of programming i guess.
---
Many people can't and dont want to use mics.
---
There must definitely be something wrong with you if you think wanting financial indipendence and wanting to use the funds you earned is "abusive" ô,0
---
That’s among one of the more logical answers breaking it down, even if the logic doesn’t make sense from a gameplay viewpoint. It usually seems to happen around super mutants and such. Rarely do you ever see them not around a different faction. I think you’re right on point with this.
---
The more that I think about it, I recall the situations and it mainly happens, if not all the time where multiple factions would be available.
---
This sounds fun :)
---
I'll stop by and see what ya got
---
This guy only came after me when the defense missions popped up. He would show up contest and kill me while I was trying to kill the mobs. I think since they cut the caps people drop in survival but not adventure the ass holes would rather try and farm caps from level 20s because its easier and gets them the same as say a level 100 in survival
---
Then don't fast travel ...
---
I’d rather they add something to do.
---
Yes you mentioned it, I'm not denying that.  But it wasn't your main gripe. Which is my point that you keep avoiding. 
---
Before you watched his response video you harped about him being a neck beard and homophobic. After you watched the video all of a sudden your biggest issue was the abuse of the report system.
---
And if you say differently, the world can see what you've typed and that you're lying so please save your breath.
---
As far as linking comments, you know what you said, everyone can see for themselves what you said and how hateful you were being over a few clearly biased videos from the same few people.
---
I'm sure in life you're impossible to please and no matter how good or hard someone tries for you there's just no winning.
---
Like I've said you're just determined to be combative over someone you've admitted you don't watch much.
---
Good luck with all that hateful vitriol you put forth in the world without knowing anything for sure.
---
If someone attacks first it's always fair game. I was on my new character building a base near 76 and was level 6 at the time and a level 12 started hitting me. My friend was level 120 and looked at me like wtf is he doing so we waited to see if he would go away. He didn't so we killed him. He came back like 5 times to try and kill me. It was weird
---
Thanks for the info. Has someone tried getting radiated there? In that Case it could maybe be Bug or something like a change from Bethesda
---
The only part that gets me is that it happens with explosive shots. If I use my bloodied lever, it seems to do fine majority of the time. Explosive damage is near a guarantee.
---
because a relationship usually pools its money together ?
---
Bethesda cut the rewards they can get now from survival so I guess they would rather just pick on low levels in adventure now
---
Not every marriage is equal and asking for permission to spend your own money is rather archaic to say the least.
---
My fiance and i have our own bank accounts and a shared one for bills, no one has to ask for permission or inform anyone about what you spend your money on, as long as you pay your part of the bills everything is fine.
---
Most of my married friends handle it similarly, the only people i know that have only one single blob of finances are generally a lot older than me and my friend in our late 20s and early 30s.
---
Whata your psn?
---
Ok, don’t really have anything good but I’d rather someone else buy them super cheap that wants them over me just selling them to a vendor
---
Username: The_Pete_Jones
---
Use protest signs
---
So you are trying to say, having separate bank accounts means you wont be happy or last, but having a shared one does?
---
Thats not only ridiculous thats also a rather childish thought process... have fun with your controlled life my dude :)
---
Retarded mechanic. Just dump players of a specific level range into separate servers so this idiocy of not being able to do a quest because of enemy level scaling in the area becomes a non-issue, which it should be.
---
Sigh.
---
I love the game, but I do end up infuriated a lot of the time with the bugs...
---
They "can" come through. I've had maybe two pop through but that was a long time ago. Also you can Use the chair near the window to teleport in, avoiding sneaking around.
---
Try to buy whatever you want in the atom store and see how long you can keep up.
---
I can promise you that they want you to spend a lot more atoms than you can earn, but they aren't offering enough items, and the pricing makes people reticent to spend.
---
I haven't used my free atoms, but the point is that I might spend a dollar or two on something, but not 5, 10, or 15, when I can just buy another entire game for that much.
---
&gt;and rolled it over yo 421 for easter
---
Thanks a lot! Helped me out a lot today.
---
I'm in Vegas.
---
This topic couldn't get more fallout 76. It's current a.f.
---
Watch out, Bethesda might ban you too like the 900 hours guy
---
&gt;relationships should always discuss spending habits. thats a healthy relationship.
---
Only if these spending habits pertain to you not being able to pay your share...
---
I dont need to know what my fiance spends her money on as long as the bills get paid. I dont care if she spend all of her money for her hobbies, she earned it. The same goes for me. Neither of us really is that easy going with money and we always pay our share, so everything is fine.
---
Why shouldnt you be able to spend the money you earned however you want?
---
\#GetThisGuyAPip-Boy2000
---
I've had a few come through, but it's such a low number I consider it an anomaly. I've had ghouls teleport through my locked houses when they do that tackle/jump attack.
---
Pretty good idea
---
You're not linking because you know you are wrong, the reporting issue has been the main issue from the get go, and if you linked any of my previous comments you'd be proven wrong about that claim. I made a point to bring up the report issues because that is the biggest thing wrong he is currently doing.
---
It is like you think you can only care about one thing. You can take issue with many actions of people. He didn't address the report abuse and he won't because he knows he is in the wrong.
---
She no longer scales with the number of players but has a flat 0.3 multiplier for incoming damage:
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/UchNpQM](https://imgur.com/a/UchNpQM) 
---
If your weapon deals 100 damage, she gets 30 damage and her DR reduces it to 6.5 damage per shot. You'll need to shoot her 5.2x more if you solo'd her.
---
We already bought the $300 bag. It doesn't get better buy burning money we could use to buy another $300 bag. I love Fallout, but I don't get any more play from the atom store. Not one minute.
---
why not read my other comments instead of picking up at the begining.
---
Yet, it’s coming.
---
Had a 2 star legendary mire queen help me kill a bunch of scorchbeast last night. That was really nice for a change. She was nasty man. Couldn’t kill her she’d melt me so fast I was mashing stims
---
Couldn't agree more. Just had a quick return, tried to do some quests at level 32 but couldn't because level 100 players are running around and all the mobs in the area get auto-scaled to match them. This shit game is uninstalled for good on my system. What a fucking idiotic design. They should manage their servers so that players within a certain level range do not fuck up gameplay for other players of another level range.
---
Well there is a camera coming and it requires film as ammo to shoot. It’s not impossible.
---
Aaaaah Iam jealous right now 😊, Vegas is in the top 3 of my Todo List...
---
For the love of all fallout, no more perks. At least until they sort the current ones and lower the amount needed for QoL gaming.
---
I wouldn’t like this.
---
Sadly I think the game is too fundamentally flawed to ever be patched into a state where it'd worth coming back too. I doubt the suits at Bethesda will be willing enough to spend money overhauling this game out of the pit of failure it's currently stuck in :(
---
It’s labeled a suspension so you can’t do a chargeback
---
I was so sad when I discovered this, it happened like 2 or 3 patches ago, it was my favorite mutation farming place
---
Scroll down to the C.A.M.P section and then look near the bottom all the available ones should be there
---
This is so great!
---
Lol. You will get your account back same as OP. Put away the tin foil hat and stop coming up with conspiracies
---
I saw a camp yesterday. They had somehow parked it literally right behind the back door of the golf club. WTF is the point of that, to be a shithead?
---
And if we destroy their base, we’re the ones that get a huge Wanted status. Turret base owners are the ones who should be outlawed.
---
Conspiracies? Damn you’re stupid. Whelp you have a good day there chum.
---
I think they do need to sort out the current perk cars however I would like to see one for the automatic melee weapons. Even if it only boost their damage the tiniest bit.
---
Thanks for your help. Found it my first try. Appreciate you.
---
I do buy what I like and I have 3500 atoms to spare
---
Problem with mole rats is, if you are sneak and you get danger from them, every mob around sees you too.
---
Which is not much problem anymore when escape artistan don't work at all.
---
I bought handmade plan, been making and scrapping, learning mods in the process.   Works on handmade.
---
&gt; not to flex
---
Proceeds to flex
---
I’ll give it to you though since OPs wife clearly calls the shots
---
Well, a lotbof the tine you have to wait a minute or so before the legendary item appears in a legendary corpse, so you probably had 2 legendary items spawn after you gave up
---
At this point, six months in .. The pricing must be working for their revenue goals because it hasn't changed much.
---
Basically yeah it's not for you but they just may be making plenty from others if they are still doing it. 
---
I broke down and bought $40 worth of atoms because I wanted a few things, I wanted to support the game and I realized and understood that atom shop items are not a value based proposition at all but simply a function of desire.
---
No, but it will happen that you want to have a 1\* or a 2\* or a 3\* of a perk when you tweek your loadout.
---
Sweet, just as long as I have nothing to worry about. The lockpick one popped last night after 54 locks.
---
12k ultracite 50 cal for my fe .50. Usually use between 750-2500 rounds depending on how bad/ good the lobby is.
---
I replied to this specific comment, in this single comment chain... why would i search your comment history just to reply to a comment you made here... if it needs backstory, either provide it in this comment or accept how people react to your words.
---
Derp. I missed the 4 part.  Failed to comprehend!
---
&gt;usually 
---
Not as far as i know, it seems a lot more common in the US than here in germany and also a lot more common in older couples than young ones.
---
Still, thats no explanation for why this would in any way be abusive...
---
Think they also need more clothing for female characters apart from dresses... My woman looks like a pissed off housewife that's just found out who the mistress is
---
Bruh.
---
Look up Crossout... then look at the pack prices, then the game gold... the player run market has items going for about 50x the price of the highest gold pack. 
---
Don’t complain about FO76... it’s vastly more reasonable then most
---
I already have Thru Hiker3*
---
Can I place a turret atop a column?
---
yes him and grahms inventory both change when you relog
---
OK thx so Bethesda changed it. This helped to solve this thread
---
Damage buffs are applied before armor ignore.
---
What we could infer about two shot is that buffs also apply to that second bullet except receiver changes.
---
(Still inference) Two shot works similarly to shotgun pellets, the game tallies all projectiles that hit and adds up their buffed damages. I think each bullet gets a proportion of the total listed damage, so if one shot is 100, two shot is 125, each projectile has 62.5 damage and then if only one projectile hits, that is pitted against armor.
---
No worries, gkad it helped.
---
Ok thanks for the info and does Graham sell good apparel/plans
---
For fucks sake it’s not pay to win... you can receive RKs as rewards for events, quests, and daily or weekly achievements. The shop ones are for those who feel like supporting the game or have atoms left over after getting a skin or outfit because “hey free weapon fix? Cool why not!”
---
This is my favourite place for it.
---
Love this!! We live in Kentucky right on the WV border. I’ve loved how realistic they’ve kept locations in the game. The only disappointment I had was Hillbilly Hotdogs lol We finally visited the “restaurant” last year and when I found it in the game, “Really? That’s it’s??” Lol ah well. I love this game, and all the fans. Maybe I can talk my husband into doing something like this!
---
Same here man. It gets lonely out there. Not on ps4 by chance are you?
---
Bethesda games had always one of the best ragdolls.
---
There is a bunch of kids in here that don't understand relationships i see.
---
Why not?
---
Wrongo!
---
you were blessed by godd howard
---
the only real unique things he sells is the starburst clock and the mirror ball (disco ball)
---
I didn't buy the bag...
---
I don't want to move my camp for free damnit!
---
U could sell it on market for 2k maybe
---
Steam sales are a good example of how when prices are lowered, let's say by half, sales increase exponentially. They have said so many times. There is a very good reason that low priced items are also crowding the check out lanes at stores. It is because low cost items will be bought as impulse purchases as long as they are a couple of dollars at the most.
---
No atom shop item should be more than $3, imo, and they would be making now profit by lowering prices.
---
Wasn't any bad press...everything that was said about the game was true.
---
Aaaaand it changes link to n&amp;d after you press save button. I tested it with new build and created new char. Link to n&amp;d appeared in config file after i pressed save button
---
ha! thats awsome thanks!
---
I know that crickets have a one use negate all incoming damage “perk” for the first or second strike inflicted on them.
---
I’ve been doing some investigation on enemy “perks”, concluding it is a thing and some can be IDed as ones we have access to and others are weird species specific. Radants have full white knight and barbarian going...
---
It's been said time and time again buy they just won't listen. Bethesda I've never gone below 2k Atoms on my balance and it's not because challenge rewards are too generous. It's because 90% of your Atoms store is...just bad. Most of the stuff i got from the store is not even because i like it but because it's somewhat better than average, i didn't have to pay for it and it prolly was on sale at some point. As a matter of fact there were only 2 things that i would pay real money for if i didn't have any atoms: blood stained combat armor and raider excavator skin. The only reason i didn't get excavator skin is because i don't like PA in general. Hire people who worked on armor and outfits for Fallout 3. They knew what they were doing. Or i dunno show Mad Max, Waterworld, The Postman, The 100 or some photos from Wasteland Weekend at least to the person responsible for Atom store content. Maybe he or she just don't know what post-abocalypse should look like.
---
They're also bullet sponges. Wild mongrels die to one shot whereas those dang rats take 6-7 each. And they're fast, and on the small side. Radrats were the tutorial enemy in FO1 lol, not anymore
---
fuck right off mate
---
Was playing yesterday and my compass bugged out and wasn't aligned with my character.
---
I also tried to remove some stairs from my camp for 10 minutes, they eventually disappeared but it counted as they were still there ( it wouldn't let me place them again in the same spot )
---
Yikes, I already more than supported the game with $250 of per armor edition. I'm not spending another $40 unless I get many hours of gameplay for that money. The content that has been added so far doesn't equal a $10 dlc.
---
Blackwater mine is the best place for mutation farming. Has a decon arch inside and the little bridge above the radiated water in the beginning and dish out up to 60 rads a sec
---
In 500hours i am currently on 14000 atoms.
---
So yeah why would they give you 8$ per item and then let you buy most of them free.
---
Also who would invest in game that is slowly dying?
---
Lol Sorry PS4
---
300$ was for helmet and game, bag was only addition.
---
What? No.
---
Then they aren't offering enough things that you want to buy. 
---
Their goal is to make money, and both the high prices and small inventory in the atom shop are preventing that.
---
You and I having spare atoms is not what they want, and proves there is a problem.
---
To you, to me it was worth it. 
---
Also the power armor edition is just a physical atom shop item :)
---
I have that too. I've kept it for now because I know there weren't any mods for the cultist dagger before but I could be mistaken.
---
Oh on one piece of armor. Yeah I get that, think we misunderstood each other before my bad.
---
Well not anymore lmao
---
The bag was a metaphor for buying the Fallout branded game, so I assume you did buy the game.
---
Is that the stats at low health?
---
Welcome to Appalachia Vault dweller.  
---
May your kills be swift,  
---
May your junk be useful,  
---
And may your time in Appalachia be enjoyable.
---
I disagree, everything outside the Atom shop is post apocalypse, the Atom shop is the only real way to get clean, real cloths. I think people forget to take off their over cloths and really look at what armor they are wearing. Don't put on a over suit and you'll look mad max all day.
---
I didn't pay 300 for it unless you add up the cost of every fallout game I played since I was 12 and add it together.
---
He doesn't want sympathy.
---
&gt;In the past few years through my own actions/choices I lost all my friends, lost over 55kg (120+ pounds), injured my scapula at work, lost my first/only girlfriend, lost my career aspirations, struggled to find reason to live, got suspended from fallout and my grandma just died. Because of that that injury and the emotional losses accompanying it, I live in chronic pain. My grandma was the person I would turn to as my emotional rock.
---
This was just for dramatic effect.
---
Someone was using the concept of a $300 designer bag as an example, like Coach or Gucci or something, not in relation to the Fallout special editions.
---
During one queen fight several days ago, [those air command escort vertibots flew by](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/399713408867500032/566449837243891716/unknown.png). They weren't really able to do all too much, but it was still really neat to witness them and the queen duke it out.
---
Thank you!
---
There is absolutely no way you have not run into something unintended. Just stop.
---
My wife keeps telling me I need to buy an external. But I’m stubborn
---
That’s awesome thank you! I do play on Xbox.
---
Of course I do, but it’s very rare. That’s why I said I never run into them and not I have never experienced a single bug
---
I went in just after the new one was supposed to show up in the shop and didn't see, had to exit out completely and then go back in.
---
Not all situations demands a 3\* tru hiker perk.
---
Sometimes, I swap in the Guerilla perks and have only 1 slot for the tru hiker, so I put in a 1\* card.
---
Later in the game, you will find that hoarding is not that necessary and you can start using lower level card like tru hiker, traveling pharmacy and use other perks instead.
---
This is hilarious bug, and doesn't happen often anyways considering that no one uses energy weapons.  
---
But yes the Ash Piles and Goo Piles don't have textures underneath them, and likely wont get any ever.
---
Same, i completed mine on accident just by scrapping loot as I played yesterday.
---
Ah you're right, thanks!
---
No , I’m a 30 year old casual gamer . They want little kids with no self control and have access to mommy/daddy’s cc . We call those people “whales” and we thank them for funding our games 
---
I think they have put some cool skins in so far but need more emotes(but should be free), more dark/raider skins/clothing, and the gun armor skins should be able to be applied to a larger pool of armor/weapons
---
Jealous lol
---
It’s too good
---
Yup with full unyielding
---
Wow!
---
I'd really like some gas mask skins and some love for the unloved armors (trapper / raider / robot / marine) I don't use them really (waiting for backpacks) but I'd love some options 
---
also I think it would be cool if we could make a armor outfit like I could craft a light combat armor skin that I wear as a outfit that has no armor boost just looks like that and wear whatever armor I want under it so I could snap skins and such to it I purchase - I often want to use the leather and metal skins I got but I never find any good late game versions of it yet and not a full set so I never can use them and they sit in my atom shop taunting me.....
---
Can mole rats be extinct in a future expansion? I'd very much like that.
---
I bet the dmg is even crazier with chem and meat buffs
---
Yeah watch the channel I linked he goes more in depth
---
He also say that trick where one of your teammates exits game and rejoins to you will respawn them still works for that place
---
Well, yes - I can have the physical power armor helmet on my shelf 5 or 10 years from now and it can still be appreciated and is worth something. The playtime power armor skin or whatever, in five years, means nothing and has no value to anyone who bought it. Even buying a different game for $8 that gives me 20 hours of play time is more valuable than a sofa for my CAMP.
---
The only value in microtransaction items, is in the now.
---
Fireproof has to he bugged, right? I can shoot my feet with the auto grenade launcher and not take any damage.
---
“I never run into them” literally means never... also yes you do. Idk if maybe you’re entirely oblivious to them but yes you do.
---
I carry a premade 2x3 foundation prefab hut I give to new people when I see them - made of warehouse metal walls has place above door for a turret or 4 even has working lights inside and 1 of each of the work benches (minus power armor) a bed and a tuba because hey why not a tuba 
---
I get them to team me jump over tot he camp drop it and they get so excited I wave and walk off as they explore it
---
I got to the end of that quest and couldnt beat it cause I kept getting wrecked. I was with a lvl 150 guy as well.
---
A level 50ish legendary super sledge. Not sure what kind is best just need decent damage.
---
If this actually happened, that's awesome! I don't get many random encounters like this, a 95 Behemoth found his way into Whitesprings the other day but other than that, haven't had a good clusterfuck for months
---
Is that really what drives microtransactions? That's terrifying.
---
I'm older and would have thought it was those like us who have the most disposable income, but they are doing nothing to get it. I want content and dlcs. If they released a new Fallout and Elder Scrolls every year I would but them. Not going to buy hats though.
---
I’ve been playing since day two and have 700hrs in the game, it’s way better than it was. So much so that I bought three of my friends the game for us four to play last night. We played for like 6 hrs straight without and major issues at all (other that my game freezing up once). That’s insane compared to at launch. The stability is way better and it’s just a smoother experience. Is it perfect? No. But it’s worth the low price you can find it at. I bought them three copies on amazon (all tricentennial editions) for $45 after tax and shipping. Codes for bonus gear had been used, but that’s still the base game for $15 each which ain’t bad.
---
I've been wanting to do same on Mt. Desert Island./Far Harbor.
---
Finding corpses has always been a pain in fallout
---
Lmao dude why is it so hard to believe I rarely run into bugs? 
---
I have had the weird lighting/texture bug twice since buying the game
---
Power armour glitch I have noticed a few times
---
Invisible objects in camp I’ve had twice but I very rarely change up my camp 
---
My compass has never bugged
---
I’ve never seen an enemy with an incorrect name 
---
Sorry dude but my game isn’t fucked like yours is
---
Hillybilly Hotgdogs was one of the locations we originally planned on visiting but had to skip.
---
Yes it’s actually way better then most of the reviews say. Most of the reviews are probably just people bitching about the game cuz they wanna fit in with the crowd. I bet u some people who wrote bad reviews don’t even own the game! Just buy a cheap version of the game and u decide for urself how good it is because the community can’t be trusted with this one...
---
Not sure if it’s maxed? What is the max?
---
What do you mean invincibility? She’s never invincible, she just regenerates at half health.
---
Anyway when you fire a nuke, make sure there’s a good 10-12 players over level 100 and you should be fine. You’d have to be very unlucky to fail.
---
Not sure what max is?
---
This happens to me with the Watoga robots every once in a while. It usually means that someone has been farming there before you, and the server is late in telling your client that, nope, that one is already dead.
---
And with the daily challenges, everybody is just farming the same spots to finish them, so running into dead critters is just that more likely. Just keep server hopping and that should do the trick, but it might take a few tries.
---
As for the radroaches, their health melts away before my eyes and they drop dead, too, but that's because I have the Plague Walker mutation, and those count towards my kills. The funny thing about it is that it's usually radworms that I'm afflicted with, so radworms killing radroaches is a bit of an ironic twist. :-p
---
hahaha... when we were at the Greenbrier I kept telling my wife I'd feel better if I had some power armor with me :)
---
I get the weirdest crap happens ingame. I think it’s cuz this one toon has little to no luck.
---
It literally was like some weird party, large groups of people stumble in and all the while I’m trying to get them to only fight each other, instead of me. 
---
Note I’m a tanking stealth rifleman, but that behemoth wasn’t taking NO, so while running Id toggle big guns and all rise, PA.
---
His corpse was the one I really wanted but couldn’t find.
---
I see what u did their...
---
A blast.
---
Nuclear bombs for all I guess! Now aim for white-springs!
---
Lies, lies, lies... until you've ate dog food and killed a 13 year old kid for stealing your tato you have not recreated anything...
---
It’s hard as hell in cranberry or the mire.
---
The enemy needs to be at full health, not you.
---
Currently hovering about 700 in my stash, I bulk regularly and sell all but 6 of each bulk component.  
---
I have too many known plans, but I'm saving them for player vending.  
---
I should clear out ammo I don't use or have too much of, also chems and food.  
---
I don't hoard clothing, armour or weapons, don't see the point.  
---
But in the end, it's each to their own. Whatever works for you.
---
It might help if there was a well known location where things like coming changes and known bugs/issues were published.
---
I can't even find the current Fallout inside the vault article without 10 minutes of searching, since they are apparently not hosted on a single index page, and googling returns a December posting.
---
With a Nuka fountain as a possible reward, think chocolate fountain but with Nuka Cola.
---
A link to the katest one if on the bethesda luancher i believe before you click to play the game
---
Thanks!!  
---
I just gave up on reading the imgur comments.  haha
---
There’s this other shitty thing that you can do... pacify the scorchbeast queen with the animal friends perk. (For me at least), it brings her back to full health
---
To add to what others said, PvP more or less ignores DR and HP so automatic weapons are extremely easy to kill with, especially ones that do splash damage so you can hit people behind objects
---
Have the same thing on PC.  Did you play in the BETA?
---
Same here. I have this problem commonly, and I’m not moving my camp because I’ve put over 12 hours of work into it, and I love it (not like it) where it is now
---
If it's not gone already I would love to buy it as well
---
I’m in the same boat, I just find this game bland compared to other fallouts
---
Yes I did.
---
Similar thing happened to me. Lost a t 51 stealth chest and a calibrated leg. Also a travel coat. That said I suspect mine was probably scrapped by mistake due to quick scrapping and somehow the input was delayed and scrapped my stuff instead.
---
I no longer scrap stuff in power armour due to this
---
The value is for you. For me, that skin or that sofa brings me not value than that $8 game that may have a steep learning curve and probably isn't my style.
---
I'm simply saying value is different for each and you clearly are not who they want to market to right now.
---
There aren't ANY approved mods yet. Before launch BGS said they were aiming to allow mods at some point in the future. Don't hold your breath. 
---
I tried an inventory management mod but every patch release it broke, so I deleted it.
---
Mountaineer here too!
---
I think it may be due to that, but I could be wrong.  Neither character I started during BETA has been able to complete certain items.  I’m trying a third I just started to see if that works.
---
Howdy neighbor
---
Thats pretty sick tbh
---
If anyone knows of a trade discord, let me know, haha
---
Yes it's the western part of Virginia.
---
Start A new character and choose the most unintuitive bud possible, like pipe pistol tank. It's a different game than typical melee build everyone uses
---
They are with the deathclaw statue, i had to scroll left to find them, under floor decorations
---
Fr😂 my bad though I though it was the death claw gauntlet but it’s actually the meat hook. One handed is bugged rn and works for the meathook along with unarmed perks. The meathook is what gets you to 45k but it’s a bug they need to fix I’ve got a friend that runs it and there’s pretty much nothing I can do to survive one shot in full assassins sentinel specked out to where I avoid almost all dmg.
---
If its 40 or lower and you havent played it at all, adventure mode is fun. They just released a survival pvp mode with, like, different rules of engagement.. but overall worth it for that price imo
---
Buy it back.  Close out of the vendor menu and go back in.  It will cost you, but it will show up for purchase.
---
Besides what OP said I would also recommend doing it in the winter so that your photos are similar to the game since a lot of the trees and plants will be brown/leafless.
---
I regularly play with a 12 year old kid I met from my country in-game. He is actually pretty smart for his age and very nice so I don't mind playing with him at all, although you can tell how young he is by the things he talks about haha.  
---
It's pretty cute too how when he asks me to play he types "Hello, do you want to play? Just wondering..." like I'm going to get mad haha. He also said I was like the pope and I asked hi mwhat he meant and he said "because you're so cool", haha.
---
It is and it's much better now compared to when it was launched
---
Prove it. 
---
Because Bethesda says it isn't.
---
His ban happened in Feb., well after this "golden age"  of ammo production you claim, without any supporting evidence beyond your "feelz", he was so fortunate to be in.
---
I guess that I read such content when I'm away from the game computer, so that would explain it. When I run the Bethesda launcher, it is to get in game asap.
---
There is no Bethesda launcher on my phone or other devices.
---
I have deleted the beta and as i say i have cleared the data files and deleted and reinstalled the game. You may want to try this as it cured some things but no this.
---
Also, your wording was perfect. Grammatically and logically. My GT is what made it hilarious.
---
My goto caps maker is Fort Defiance, kill ann the ghouls, take all the chems and pick up all the straight jackets, they sell for 43 caps each with lvl 3 hard bargain. Plus it's a fun place to clear out
---
I did this.
---
One of the Freedom Trail discs is at a Chipotle. If I remember correctly, it's the Old Corner Bookstore one. I just thought it was hilarious that I was following a slice of American history and looked up at the direction of the arrow to see.. a Mexican restaurant. Old North Church was great too.
---
I was over there to get married (no not in Old North Church. Got married up in Salem). Back in UK now, though.
---
Yeah this sub should have the latest ITV stickied each week really
---
They can and should be marketing for everyone, not for one group or the other.
---
I'm really surprised Camden Park didn't take advantage of the free press and do more. There was a fan Meetup there but it was organized by a fan, not Camden Park.
---
Active? What? do you think we all come on here to talk about a game that nobody plays anymore?
---
yeah, it's 39 AUD (which is about 27.91 usd), and it's usually about 50 AUD ( 35.78 usd).
---
Are you able to start a character on one gamemode, but also be able to play with that character on a different gamemode? (is that makes sense)
---
Yep, character restrictions are just that. You can hop between modes whenever!
---
Are there still issues with the stash and server problems, such as server lag when there's too many people, etc?
---
There's no need to link what everyone can see in your comment history. It's all right there.
---
I don't believe you can only care about one thing. I'm saying the abuse of the report system was at the bottom of your list so to speak. 
---
I feel you're attempting to distract, once again, from my main point that your focus was on being hateful based on the same few hateful videos. I know they're hateful because I've watched them. You were calling him a neck beard and homophobic....Throughout the entire thread.
---
After you watched his response video all of a sudden your main focus is the abuse of the reporting system without the name calling.
---
You can paint it in whatever light you like.
---
WOW those pics were awesome. I remember to tip/gift the wife.. Lol
---
Yes, and no.
---
The suppressor can be learned through scrapping rifles.
---
It's the Easter weekend. The bots all spent their caps at the Whitesprings Bar on booze after Biv showed up to the party.
---
As much as I don't understand why anyone would pay real money for anything on the Atom shop, I am glad they do.
---
I personally would never spend a dime of real money on the atom shop (still have ~2000 free ingame atoms).
---
The fact that prices aren't dropping means people are buying stuff. That is good for the future of the game.
---
Yes you start a character and can switch between adventure and survival mode (PvP) at your own free will
---
So, is now the 21st and I'm still experiencing this bug... Has anyone had this resolved as yet?
---
Apparently not, patch 9 it "might" be.
---
They should be marketing to whoever brings them the most money which is probably people like me and less people like you. 
---
My opinion is that they have identified people like me ato their core atom market already - the coming repair kit hints at that. Casuals like myself who enjoy the game but don't have the time to play to earn atoms or the higher end repair kit that you get from playing are the ones who will be buying the kits in the atom store.
---
I play once or twice a week for an hour or so. I have no problem dropping a few dollars on a repair kit so I can play more how I want in my limited time vs hunting earnable repair kit.
---
Honestly if they’re so against adding mounts or vehicles of some kind, I’d say what they ought to do is make a set of power armor that fulfills this purpose. Like, some kind of prototype Power Armor built with less of a focus on armor and more on increased speed. Maybe on par or weaker than the Excavator set, just makes you run really fast and depletes your stamina slowly.
---
I've seen the mod sold, maybe at Watoga? I'm not sure how the new vendors work, but check whitesprings first they seem to have almost everything. But with mods being messed up right now that might be futile as well.
---
What I meant was if there was a large amount of people still playing it. I knew there were still people playing, I was just wondering if numbers had dwindled or gone down after the whole launch fiasco and then problems with the game during the past couple months.
---
weird, right? I agree.
---
Okay, that actually sounds pretty good then! 
---
Thanks :)
---
Console or PC?   
---
I’m genuinely curious.  I rarely have most of the issues others report on textures, etc.  I do have the major ones like unable to use boxed mods, etc.
---
Okay, thanks for telling me :)
---
Np, enjoy getting wasted!
---
Youre welcome. Definitely a game worth buying.
---
Thanks I’ll check tonight after Easter Brunch.
---
welp, can't wait to buy it then! :D
---
Can't wait to play it then :)
---
Hmmm.  I’ve had to reinstall due to crashes.  If anything changes with this new toon, I’ll let you know.
---
Yeah in the past, any service desk tickets I sent to Bethesda always asked if I was running 3rd party mods.
---
[The Guarantee](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Guarantee)
---
I don't.  Sorry.
---
If your going to pick a mutation I would definitely say marsupial. Most beneficial as a melee build. You can jump over enemy’s and get onto roofs if need time to heal
---
I see it mainly with my Bloodied Handmade, never with my Bloodied PF. Neither of those are explosive, so, who really knows. :)
---
Adrenal reaction combos really well with radicool, nerd rage, and a bloodied weapon.
---
But, if you don’t have any of those, I’d go with twisted muscles. Or marsupial, because that’s really fun :).
---
Best and most annoying way I ever came up with is to just hunker down and wait till their bodies become meet piles and look for flies. You can toss grenades to ragdoll the smaller bodies so they flop around. There's isn't a good way though, i wish it was like FO4 where objects we're highlighted if you were searching for something, with whatever perk that was.
---
:)
---
They've not been released yet. There's only 5 available from quests just now which are Yao Guai, Wendigo, Rad stag, wolf and Owlet.
---
I sold it to a player
---
There’s still room for improvement, but the game is infinitely better than at launch.
---
When I first started playing Fallout 76, my 1st character build stank, so I would use grenades a lot.
---
Wait, where did they say they're actually going to fix it?
---
She is definitely a saint among women.  Luckily, she is very supportive of my Fallout obsession (which sounds better than "addiction" haha).
---
Wtf.
---
You just look at them and they fall dead.
---
You should see it in action
---
That's quite devious when you think about it!
---
Although, I think most people show up in Power Armor for this particular event.
---
What was nice is I already had a lot of it. My mom gave me the hat for Christmas a couple years ago, the combat boots are my old hiking boots, and my wife collects gas masks. I got the PIP Boy from Spirit Halloween store and ordered the shirt.  I'm just glad I don't RP as someone running around in the clown outfit...would have been WAY more self conscious ;)
---
"the fancy man of the wastes" is a great moniker. You should get cards printed
---
How do you get the Yao Guai and owlet? I haven’t seen any videos or posts about how to get those.
---
Been looking for that plan for months. I have almost every other weapon plan. 
---
Why can't a vendor sell it?
---
awesome album!
---
From doing the Sheepsquatch quest line
---
If every post on the front page of reddit, and I don't mean just r/fo76, but actually the whole reddit, was all posts complaining about non-cosmetic $$$ items "in game purchases" - well, that would be just *awesome*.
---
Not fade away...
---
Marsupial is probably the best all around mutation
---
Ah
---
Assault rifle plans just dropped for me on Distant Thunder down near Watoga.
---
Do you mean the event because I did the quest and didn’t get those
---
Considering how horrifying radiation mutations are in Fallout, oh god please no.
---
Nope the quests, did you do the side missions? There's 3 I think that you can start inside the taxerdermy place on the guys wall map board.
---
People like me bought Fallout 1, 2, Tactics, 3, NV, 4 and 76 when each of these came out, whenever possible as special editions such as the Pip-boy and Power Armor editions, along with every DLC offered along the way. If they aren't marketing to consumers like me, then they hate money.
---
You could also buy the pre-made serums instead of the recipes.  They don't cost nearly as much (and if you do the aftermarket, they are cheaper still).
---
I'd agree that Marsupial is the most useful overall, so it's the first of the recipes I bought.  Thinking about player vending, everyone can benefit from that one.  I'd say that Adrenal Reaction would be second because, again, it's something everyone can benefit from.  We'll all be at low health at some point and the extra survivability is nice.  Also, we've seen that mutation break in a previous patch, and if there's a need to re-apply it, it would be nice to having crafting as an option.
---
Twisted Muscles and Talons are both great for melee players, Twisted Muscles being the more general one of the two.
---
Some junk is only sellable after it's bulked at a tinker's bench, but that stuff is some of the highest value scrap too. There's no scrap items that are unsellable though.
---
If you don't have to run around scavaging stuff, that breaks, as you're running around to fix the stuff that broke earlier, well - there wouldn't be much point left to play the game, would there?  
---
Yes, the SBQ is obnoxiously hard - but other than her, and perhaps solo fighting regular SBs (while your main weapon is broken), there isn't much repeat content that's challenging enough to be fun.
---
Defending workshops against mole rat hordes is just BS. So many times they just get stuck in walls or underground and go "I ain't ever coming out!" no matter what you do.
---
I'm concerned that the glacial development pace is an indication that they are not earning at the atom store. The game industry is littered with examples of companies shooting themselves in the foot for stupid reasons.
---
Or when you have the "danger" warning and cant fast travel and you spend 5 mins searching for an insignificant mole rat that you don't even need to attack because your electrically charged mutation does it for you... lots of danger there.
---
Lucky guy!
---
I got three levels on my 40 by joining a SB event. It was a heavy weapons build, and I just indiscriminately shot everything that moved. As long as you tag it, you get XP, so tagging level 60 scorched deathclaws and sloths and whatnot before they day is easy XP. When not tagging, I focused on killing the hordes of normal scorched to be useful.
---
I also bought all those except the power armor edition which I just didn't care about so much. 
---
76 isn't those games, it's created and marketed to a different audience than you and since it hasn't deviated since launch I suspect that means it's making them enough money to keep them satisfied. 
---
We will just have to disagree,I suppose.
---
I failed an event because a mole rat teleported/tunneled from one end of the event to the other back and forth without stopping for 5 minutes, running out the clock. I just watched him in VATS, unable to do anything.
---
Do you really think they are doing ok financially with this game?
---
What about the chameleon trapper right leg? 😄
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
I never called him a pedo, wtf are you even talking about? Now I know you're just making shit up to defend him. Too bad public opinion has already been decided, its why he is losing subs, pateron donors, and can't even get more than 30k views on his videos in the last 3 months.
---
If you want to keep defending him, that is your own choice, that is up to you. Just realize the majority of people aren't falling for his lies.
---
Very well done, I enjoyed those pics more than I would have thought.
---
My point exactly. I've bought from the shop ($40 in atoms), I wanted things and have more money than time to earn in game atoms so I did it.  
---
I'm certain others spend much more than I have and I'm glad that I don't HAVE to pay if I didn't want to, to play.
---
They increased stash space from 400 to 800 now, server still lags when you spawn in at the Encrypted or Scorched Earth event but that's mainly because almost the whole server is there when it starts
---
Sure thing. It was at NAR Repair Yard, if that matters.
---
I always hated/liked when an enemy would just fly away on top of a mountain or roof, unable to be looted. At least with bloody mess you could explode their bodies and loot their giblets.
---
Very cool!!
---
People already have, aten_ra already even came and explained it to you, you could easily farm all of those numbers in nuked whitespring by relogging to reset all the flora and ghouls.
---
You could leave nuked whitespring with over 100k pounds of crafting mats in one day.
---
There's one simple workaround:
---
Stand still, don't move and end the fight in one shot. 
---
It has a 100% success rate for me.
---
I don’t think limb damage weapons are good for pvp. Anyone with a good build for pvp is most likely running adamant skeleton 3, which you take no limb damage. 
---
Not sure how they are in pve though.
---
Yes. It's likely making a small profit, at least. 
---
It shouldnt have cost much to develop compared to a regular fallout game and ongoing costs should be easily managed. 
---
I've no idea how many units they sold up front but I bet it wasn't shabby and at $30-40+ per unit they should have a decent nest egg to keep the lights on even if things weren't going to plan.
---
Well then they could put some more under Armor in the store as well. So u can see the Armor over the top of it.
---
Only problem is it won’t offer S.P.E.C.I.A.L boosts or defence like the modded BOS under Armor or modded vault suit.
---
Oh ok thanks for letting me know
---
Yeah but in the months since they made those design decisions they've realized that a sizeable portion of the players don't want to PvP and want their own servers where they can pretend everyone is actually from the same vault and are working together to rebuild. That perk card is fine on the PvP servers where it's obvious that everyone from the vault decided they really resented having to wait in line to do their laundry behind those other people for the past 25 years.
---
What I mean by not needing nukes and dragons is you don't need to go to their site. Whatever they do in the background doesn't really matter to most. They just want to be able to make loadout in game like they used to. Which is exactly what the newest update allows again like it was prior to patch 5.
---
This is really all you can do.
---
It's also why random Mole Rat encounters are so irritating.  They basically *make you* stop and fight, because otherwise they'll follow you all across the map, burrowing and unburrowing.
---
I'm waiting for the bilco doors in Huntersville to open - fev anyone,
---
It would make more sense of they let you craft your own legendary prefixes or at least roll for additional ones with tokens you exchange or whatever system they decide. 
---
The “insta win” weapon doesn’t exist anymore, no doubt the TSE pre patch was this weapon, especially with a dense torso and fire proof (no more suicide), but now you have people actually making builds, yeah obviously some of the builds are crazy good but people put work into it and grind for it. I don’t see how rolling for the effects you desire is bad when legendary enemies aren’t dropping the right loot for their rating, it’s still going to be a grind for tokens and I doubt it will be cheap, the ratio will probably be skewed to a disgusting amount anyway. Not to mention that PVE builds are not the same as PVP builds and people require different needs. 
---
But if people are tossing away multiple legendaries you don’t like for 1 random perk you don’t it makes no sense, you’d be better off selling them to a vendor and hopping on Reddit to buy whatever you’re looking for. 
---
I suppose we don’t have enough info yet but hopefully Bethesda is going to release more information on the mechanics before launch, right now the only things anyone knows for certain is:
---
1) Location 
---
2) Tokens
---
So it’s probably better to not start making assumptions
---
Just ignore him. It happened to me too, a crappy 1* pipe rifle on my second character. some people refuse to believe anything until it suddenly hits them. Then they will trumpet to the heavens.
---
I have moments like this. The occasional level 22 feral that’ll hit me once with a running power attack even though they’re a decaying corpse that can somehow muster up enough strength and speed to hit me at Mach 8 does enough damage to cripple a limb
---
I like to go to Silvia Homestead every day and pick all the corn and razorgrain with green thumb. You get ~140 corn and ~200 razorgrain. Each sells for 1 cap (not sure if you can oush it to 2) but that's another 400 caps each day.
---
I'm fine with weapons being different, but I find it odd how many "new" weapons have almost no mods. The sickle, Bowie knife, even the fire axe/hatchet really. They're cool weapons, but except for the axe are basically junk.
---
Very cool!
---
For years to come!
---
How about the 3 * chameleon Trapper right leg?
---
Took me forever to learn. So many screws.
---
So much negativity... 
---
I think they're going to be okay. They delayed this feature for a reason....
---
This is awesome man, great work from both you and your wife 👍
---
This is cool. I meant to do something like this myself but haven't got around to it. Perhaps this summer I will do that. I do have a comparison shot of the Green Bank Telescope though.
---
Had this issue earlier on ps4 after someone nuked Harper's and it lasted for 3 hours after nuke zone ended I wound up jumping servers
---
I’ve heard renaming is bugged. I’ve been very nervous to use it
---
Exactly
---
nope, sounds rage inducing and like a mode i would never touch
---
also go look up survival mode, we have full pvp with added aid dropping now (on top of junk/caps)
---
Honestly, I'm more confused by the two VERY different sides of the Sunday Brother's story that also includes Brianna...
---
You get a fairly decent number of Atoms just for playing the game.  The challenges are more tedious now, yes, but you'll still stay afloat if you wait for sales and don't bother with the expensive skins.
---
I have no problem chipping in if there's something I *really* like.  I paid $35 for the game.  It's given me something like 450 hours of entertainment.  It's worth it.  Besides, it's not like I'm paying a monthly subscription.  The servers are a constant drain for Bethesda - they have to make it up somewhere.
---
I imagine it could run into the NV problem, where you buy a crappier gun for a lower price but it gives you the better one as well. I'm sure there will be a host of glitches and bugs for a while. Hopefully it irons out smoothly
---
Put a mine on 1 of the locations they tunnel up to then go to the other, when he pops up its pop goes the molerat
---
Console.
---
I don’t know if I would compare the Grafton Monster with them though, because although it’s a cryptid in the game I think the guy who made the story in real life admitted to having made up the story. I’m not entirely sure though.
---
No.  None of these things are in my possession anymore, and this thread is a month old.  Sorry.
---
I wonder what it looked like to someone who was driving by. 
---
Still a good photo nonetheless.
---
If you need a suppressor and you're on PS4, I can do it for you.
---
Based on the slow introduction of even new atom shop content, I fear that things are much worse.
---
I could never track where it was ending up, just see it pop from one extreme end to the other, almost immediately. I tired running after it for a bit, then throwing grenades whiles standing still. It probably spawned in two weird spots and just got stuck in a loop.
---
Also sometimes i dont have the stuff i want to trade on me so there should be a "hang on - let me grab my stuff" emote

You should have titled the post "Mild Appalachia" smh

Only just the PC version, it came from people glitching into the Dev room, which can't be done on Xbox/Ps4

Shame, ive had them a few times just soazzing between 2 locations (which ever one i wasnt at) so i left a mine at 1 and he killed himself

My gripes about it are as follows.

*Finding people's camps. Hopefully some hub for this.

No you're just supposed to claim them from the shop.

Oh wait, isn't she the one tried turning Jesus Sundays' brother against him if i remember right? I guess the note would make sense in terms of her trying to lure some unsuspecting people to their doom for their belongings if she was pretty much a raider.

Hi there! I was able to learn all of the Mods for the Lever Action in 4ish hours of crafting. I took over a Workshop with a Junk Extractor and then visited a lot of Satellite buildings and made sure I remembered Super Duper - 2 lever actions for the price of one - pop a cheap mod on it and scrap scrap scrap - done in no time!
---
So...I made one and it still won't start the event. My son also has one and is the same.
---
Once community modding is a "supported" thing it will keep this game alive for a very long time, unless they get too greedy.

Over powered little fucks for sure

Bethesda is still deleting duping items with every patch.
---
If you drop/sell stuff really quickly you may drop one of your precious items too. Never had it happen but i remember seeing people talking about it.
---
&gt;then managed to find a new one 
---
That's a lie. You can't **find** x-01 parts. You can only craft them.

I renamed all my valuables and didn't lose any.

One guy driving by at Sutton knew exactly what was happening. He gave me the Vault Boy thumbs up which was pretty cool.

I've definitely had a few too many real life Fancy Lad Snack Cakes.  Can't deny that.

great will look for this

(150k subscribed to the sub+non-redditors)/3 platforms = packed servers
---
Well done!
---
I feel like the biggest problem will be not knowing where they are. The very best version of player vending would be a centralized player vending terminal at whitesprings and all stations that displays every player inventory on the server. Maybe it also displays the physical location if you want to visit and haggle but if the point is for people to buy and sell their stuff it should be made as easy as possible to do. Or maybe there is just a "player inventory" tab at the vendor bots. If its just a stumble upon system where i have come across your vending machine in the wild, i dont think it will be sucfessful and people will continue to buy/sell through out of game channels.
---
Anti armor or bloodied are usually the best for a melee. It depends on your build.
---
I forget where the hiddin room is. Can anyone let me know? I had the same problem had to log out quick
---
That is true. You do get more from killing in adventure.
---
Funny thing is, I renamed my stuff about a day or so before it happened.
---
Nobody'll want it at this price; I'm not criticizing, simply observing 😄
---
The sub did just gain 4k+ followers in the last week :)

Nope.  They shut down the servers a month ago.  This Subreddit is actually closed due to low traffic.  Not sure how this thread is up.

I expected people to be freaked out seeing a guy in a gas mask.

Why do you think that? ESO is still supported and going strong, and that’s probably the closest game to Fallout 76 in terms of similarity

I'm buying it at this price so thanks for observing xP

Of course it would happen on the expensive hard to find stuff. Not the mutie auto assault rifle you pick up every day.

There are so many ppl playing  its annoying.  :)

Hmm, it's always possible her personality change after the war or some other event, perhaps before the war she was always putting on a kind act, but took the post-apocalypse as the time to show her true colours?

The note, Biranna Hawke's Diary in Hawke's Refuge kinda shows this, as she talks about she once dated Juan, but over time, her and her family began resenting the Sundays because they felt the Sunday had a 'snobbish' attitude, and were jealous of their farm and supplies.

If it's not fun and you can't get into it I suggest trying to play another game. Not every game is for everybody.

Happens to me too, I assumed it’s because my floors are from the atom shop so they have some texture glitch (for some reason not all floor decor works on atom shop floors so I just assume all issues are because the floors aren’t properly implemented)
---
There's plenty of apolyptic items in game if you know how to combine item sets right. But I do agree Bethesda should add more.
---
[](/kcelestianod)Player camps are going to completely litter the most popular areas(Rip Whitesprings farming) so that people see their shops, but since they'll all be near each other people will have to server hop looking for a server where they can use the spot, and there will be a flood of complaints that camps need to lock out less space around them(Which might be cool if that means that we get the ability to place camps closer together to make neighborhoods, or big bases).  
---
Then after that everyone will use the highest auction prices from the market sub for their prices, and bogard the farming spots trying to get product, and stifle competition.  
---
Then just when we think things are going to improve someone will find a way to exploit the system to make infinite caps, carry weight, duping, and the such. We'll lose a ton of people to the ensuing ban wave, and be flooded with the usual ban wave posts.

So, it's going to be a capitalist utopia, and I can't wait. (I honestly hope it doesn't go *quite* this way, but I'm keeping my expectations prepped just in case.)

You are correct, it is the corner bookstore! I’ve done the freedom trail twice in the past few years, one of my favorite things to do while up in the Boston/Cape Cod area. Another really fun thing to see was the Kennedy Museum, a great way to spend a few hours (especially in the winter)!

I'm hopeful that survival will turn into something to pull the pvp crowd in but I dont think the people killing low levels want pvp

Also the way Bethesda is getting rid of duped items is if you have a stack of like 5 or more of the same item they reduce it down to one.

&gt;Bought a nice AA combat rifle off a guy today. Used it and liked it a lot. Went farming a while. Got jumped a few times by a hoard of randoms. When you get right into it, sometimes there’s a bit of button mashing. Especially using the Xbox elite and the bottom triggers. 20 minutes later the AA I just bought was missing. FML. Spent another hour retracing my steps 3 times. Found the bag on a fluke. Goddamn, why can’t we lock what we want to keep. Like, just give us a prompt.
---
&gt;“Are you sure you want to drop your favourite weapons”?
---
&gt;That’s a simple request.
---
If you dropped stuff by mistake once you probably did it multiple times but you prefer blaming bethesda. Here's your cached post if you don't remember posting that.

About the same as purified water? 5 caps pet.

People have this idea of junk decorations around their camp like they can just place any kickball or coffee mug anywhere they like. Hate to break it to you but I can guarantee that’s not how it’s going to work. The only items your going to be able to decorate from your stash is going to be weapons that’s will probably be on those cork board weapon displays from Fallout 4 and a shitty bobblehead display. You think Bethesda is going to add a model of each junk, aid or misc item to the CAMP building screen? Come on I hate to burst your bubbles but please wake up, I never seen them confirm “junk” just “items from stash” bobblehead stand and weapons”

Interesting comments regarding permissions and relationships.  A couple points.

1) getting permission means communicating.  When one has a joint bank accounts, bills, etc. One needs to ask if it's OK.  Priorities.

2) I've been gaming since 1976, PnP, computer, console.  My wife doesn't enjoy it at all, but she knows I like it and it's a part of me.   We respect each others' time.  I only spend about 4 hours of family time gaming per week. The rest is on my time after hours.  Its respectful to mind ones time and resources when in a partnership.

There are issues where the eggs won't show up after claiming.

No not looking for any excuse. I asked what you meant not go at you like it was hard core truth.

And believe it or not that dude isn't wrong. It's disgustingly sad but true. Age of consent varies by state but is between 16 and 18. Ohio allows a marriage at 14 or 15 with a court order. Idk if there's an age difference limit like no more than 4 years difference but It's not okay. I'm not sure about other states.

It's definitely not a legendary enemy. I shoot them, reload, and by the time I have reloaded, they get back like 20 percent life

That's fair. If you don't stabilize flux (flowers) you pick in a nuke zone it turns to inert flux-- slightly irradiated but clean water.

Bethesda if you are reading this please know we loved your work but you can never justify what you gave us. Do this again for elder scrolls and you will successfully have gone from triple A to no one will buy anything you push out.
---
Yeah it’s a known bug after patch 8
---
Or running into an invincible mole rat that keeps chasing you around at a location because you can't hide from their teleports.
---
Yes! Exactly, buncha angry sad people in here.
---
Read age of marriage in the United States on wikipedia. It's not a pretty picture. 
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_marriage_in_the_United_States
---
You have a history of dropping items by mistake and yet, in your mind it's still more likely that Bethesda is responsible for "missing items"...
---
Especially considering ESO's rather crummy start and negative reactions back then.
---
My advice is to buy the serums or serum recipes from other players. When I was getting started I just did it the old fashion way at black water mine standing next to nuclear waste barrels rolling the dice.
---
Are u sure it’s not just for the revolver rifle/pistol? Cuz a Revolver itself is normally a pistol so a revolver rifle would probably be a pistol rifle??
---
He is wrong, he was claiming 14 was the age of consent, which isn't true, the AoC in america across the country is 16, and the age for marriage is 18. Not 14 for both like he claimed.
---
You need to look into the federal laws which override the state laws.
---
Lots of inconsistencies - like Brianna says there are traps all over the Sunday place and that there was this big Gun fight there but no evidence - I even tried looking for JD's corpse but no luck
---
Simply one the coolest posts I've seen for fallout on Reddit. Absolutely amazing!
---
That’s what it is? Didn’t rlly have a use for it bc I didn’t know what it was, which was why I sold it
---
If you're on xbox, can I buy it? I'll show you my trading thread: even if you don't wish to sell it you might want some of my weapons on offer 😄 
---
If you want armor, we can talk about that too, but my armor isn't up in the post https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bfipqp/i_have_some_fantastic_firearms_to_flare_your_fancy/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Yes, all 18, except one that is 19 and one at 21.
---
Same here...
---
Yeah I can see what you mean, I tried searching for JD's corpse too since Jesus said he pushed him of the cliff, but he must have meant somewhere else, that was not the farm. As for the gun fight, they could've made the farm look a lot more in disrepair especially since it was supposed to be one fire too.
---
Now if we can just get player vending...
---
And you can clearly see just because there is federal law doesn't mean people don't slip through the cracks.
---
Even worse is:  
---
Bethesda: We're putting a new item in the game in the future. More details in four months!  
---
Everyone (three seconds later): With the new item coming, it would be great if the drop rate for that item was increased. Also if we could mod it to be legendary it would be awesome. Now what we'd really like to see is a new dungeon in which the new item would spawn, filled with scorchbeasts and a brand new six star end game boss that is half rad scorpion, half giraffe with two tails. With the new boss, we'll need an adjustment to perks and a buff to shotguns, and an increased stash limit for us to store the new item. Or better yet, an entirely new stash just for the new item. I think this new item is really going to make the game better. What kind of build should we use for this?
---
Unless it's for financial reasons, needing your wife's permission to buy something you want seems like a horrible situation.
---
Jeez you waited on one server for 3 hours to get into the burrows before switching?
---
You got me. That’s some serious logic there. 
---
ATTENTION EVERYONE
---
u/Fibblezz has dictated that if you have ever dropped an item accidentally, if it happens again it is DEFINITELY ALWAYS, going to be your fault. There are NO glitches/bugs in this game. move along, nothing to see. Those patches Besthesda pushes out every few weeks are aesthetic only.
---
Sorry I'm on PC and I do use it but thanks for the offer.
---
Could use radio channels for optional participation too. Kinda like hunt/hunted. But for pve
---
Yea. Luckily it doesn’t seem to be affected with melee. I’m a primary melee build but I use ranged  when I want to be lazy lol.
---
This! Some people on r/76market sell them for 250-300 caps :)
---
I have had that for ages.  Literally every Feral Ghoul encounter gives me Rad Worms, almost all Radrats give me Bone Worms.
---
Dont think so, make sure to clear out stored items as well.
---
Do all of them.
---
What? You don't just "slip through the cracks" with a marriage licenses. Why are you also trying to defend pedophilia? This has nothing to do with what we are talking about.
---
Do you really have to try to change the subject because you literally have no viable argument against what I've said?
---
Grog axe has never worked☹️
---
Yooo my mom bought this for me for Easter! It’s pretty awesome
---
I've been drinking this stuff only for a while now
---
amazingly helpful! You are my hero man
---
Bethesda has already said that turning on your vending machine will mark your ~settlement~ CAMP on everyone's map.
---
My pleasure! Stop by anytime!
---
If it makes you feel better, I've seen what the prize is, and it isn't impressive.
---
From what I can tell things that produce light and turrets take up a lot of space. Other than that leveling up I’ve been told helps give you more budget
---
Are they just not in the atomic shop it Should be under the camp tab in the shop and you should be able to to get whatever eggs your missing.
---
This basically an sos thing I want to exist....
---
After someone ask me to join them, only to find they wanted me to deal as a bait for 3 Radioactive bats.... While they run away.
---
Most people want weapons. The weapons should have an explosive, bloodied, anti armor or two shot legendary effect, and the most desirable of these weapons are a handmade, shotgun, gatling gun, and super sledge.
---
I just got back from a visit to Harper's Ferry
---
I can't find any good images, but [this boi right here](http://cdn.knowledgehi.com/1594x1066/20121027/storm%20chainsaw%20grand%20serious%20sam%201594x1066%20wallpaper_www.knowledgehi.com_15.jpg)
---
Vats isn't broken. A Gauss rifle is a projectile weapon, meaning the bullet has travel time.
---
I see... I’ve never seen that before sorry
---
You only seem to be concerned with being right. You acknowledge things and then dismiss quickly if it doesn't feed into what you believe.
---
Its commented on in other threads from devs that the bot picked up here.  Not going digging.
---
Not fixing this isn't an option.  Even for these clowns.
---
I’m still happy with my Tricentennial preorder. I might not be if I went for the fanciest edition, but I don’t want stuff.  The digital download was plenty for me.
---
Why though? Is this a feature or a bug
---
Can't blame you, I remember growing up with the earlier games. The latest one came out in 2011 and people were already saying it was going downhill by then. It was also mostly popular in eastern Europe
---
I’m too young for that 😂
---
Learn something new every day it seems!
---
Howdy! :D
---
What? Because I know the laws? I took law classes in college, so I know how the laws work. Pointing out someone is wrong about their claims that you can consent to sex at 14 in america or consent to marriage at that age is completely WRONG.
---
I want to know what happened to Martinsburg.
---
This is actually pretty cool and it looks like you had a lot of fun! Great job :) fyi: your wife deserves an award lol
---
Horde bosses have a tendency to get killed by random mobs during your fast travel loadscreen, i've had it happen on multiple occassions where i travel to the event, by the time i've finished loading, its over. mainly due to said boss being at the lowest level of the area and the mobs they fight are at level cap.
---
Lvl 85 here, haven't got even 1 2* drop. Every single one has been 1*
---
The page literally says in 24 states you can get married under the age of 16.
---
Horde events generally reveal circles on the map to clear, once triggered. 
---
After some time of no one going to it, it will eventually just mark the master horde. This is why the event marker will start moving. Because its following the horde master. 
---
I dont really understand why everyone rushes for the master horde. As the non master horde locations give 300xp per clearing.(i think)
---
Sure, but there are plenty of incels here.
---
I remember seeing it almost immediately after the latest update dropped, I was using an explosive gatling plasma on some bloodbugs and the goo pile was midair. It was indeed missing a bottom texture too, only showed up when I jumped or when I backed away far enough
---
I'd think it's a bug. Not sure why the developers would want it to not repair up to 200%
---
I dont know if this would be used. How would you hide from a creature long enough for another player, who's not doing anything at the time, and willing to do this, to arrive, which could take from a minute to 20. I also doubt this system would be used at all, as most new players would rather run from an SB than call a bounty on it, and hide, wasting caps and stims. And I highly believe no player above level 40 would need help with a Deathclaw or SB.
---
ooh do you have one?
---
Fancy pants of the wastes
---
If you know the laws like you say then you know underage marriage is possible and it happens
---
I personally think it's the King's poison attack that makes it so deadly. I watched one just shred my friend's life bar a while back.
---
Careful, the unarmed ones actually deal damage. As opposed to the ones with hammers and guns
---
I dont know what level you are or what the cap is if there is one but last time i verified the budget increased when you level up.
---
&gt; How do these things get missed?
---
Most of the time they don't. Testers find bugs, but you need the actual developers to go in and fix them - and given the state the game launched in, flying enemies turning into goo sometimes is *waaaay* down the list in terms of priority order for being fixed.
---
That's pretty full. Do you use the barn much, because the best possible option would be to delete it. Wait, if you have lettering and text on your walls, delete those, they take up huge amounts of space.
---
Platform? I just learned it last night. I can make it for you for free if you are on Xbox.
---
Wouldn't it be cool if we got backpacks?
---
Meanwhile, I want less post-apocalyptic stuff and more clean stuff. We're trying to rebuild, here! Let me have good, solid walls, actual glass in the windows, wallpaper, more paintings, clean kitchen stuff, and, for the love of all that is holy, clean toilets/tubs/showers.  
---
Too much grit and grime and cobbled-up stuff. We're the best of teh best. Let's show that off.
---
But literally everytime?? I don't think the boss dies everytime i wanna join a horde event?
---
Finally! Someone not complaining about bugs or trashy legendary drops and stuff! I mean those bugs and stuff are still bad. But I like being able too see people not telling everyone the game sucks! I still really enjoy the game and people should stop saying it’s so bad. It dissuades other people from playing. 2 of my friends don’t play anymore because of it... ;-;
---
I'm not saying it's not wrong, it is extremely wrong. Pretending like it doesn't happen isn't being honest though
---
I have sold three for around this price, js
---
Currently level 81 and still avoiding bats
---
Thanks for sharing this
---
The mine trick works well, if the rats are just picking 2 spots (happens frequently at ammo factory for me). It's very hard if they are using more than 2.
---
It’s rough out there in the wastelands.
---
And that pulls out quite a bit of Legendaries eh?
---
Def make sure u check ur stored shit out. I was having this prob as well cuz I had a lot of blueprints and stored stuff. It takes up a lot of buget space.
---
I was molested as a child so don't even fucking go there saying I'm defending it. I'm saying the shit happens and ignoring it doesn't help anyone.
---
I think this is a misunderstanding. It's not just the horde events that show up on the wrong place. For example uranium fever sometimes shows up somehwere in the forest area. And what is the master horde you're talking about?
---
I have one. Random drop and I can't remember how long ago or where I got. I think I picked it in February/early March.
---
Not without judical and parental consent. If you look up the numbers that the amount of people married under 18 to people over 21 is absolutely miniscule, like .0001%. Not to mention the main point I was talking about was the age of consent to sex at 14, which isn't true ANYWHERE in america. 
---
It is interesting you completely dropped that part and are only talking about the marriage part now. Kind of like how you accused me of not caring about the report system that oxhorn abuses and only caring about the homophobia.
---
So why is it cool for you to dial in to a more specific issue and ignore others you mentioned, but I can't do the same pointing out why oxhorn is scummy trying to censor others?
---
Not every game is for everyone. If you find yourself not enjoying this game as much, try something new! If you don't like the game, play a new one.
---
This is true I just dont get the mind set of some of these people.  If you want pvp go find pvp. Dont have a temper tantrum because I dont want to trade with some random that runs up to me lol. I never trade with random people because they always just annoy me and try and request my main gear
---
We are planning to do this in just a few weeks! Been scribbling a route on a map and booking lodging. Any recommendations? And do you know a place to get really good scrapple? My guy and I were just talking about how no one around here even knows what scrapple is, much less makes it.
---
People are everywhere with weird entitlements... I'm sorry that happened.
---
Yea since you can’t sell to vendors anymore it’s whatever you can get for it really.
---
With judical and parental consent. Judges aren't going to be helping pedos marry kids.
---
You're the only one avoiding me. My only point throughout all this is you're being extremely hateful based on a few hateful videos. You keep jumping around. I'm just following along and asking questions.
---
Also the SBQ has the highest energy resistance in the game IIRC so it's also wasteful of ammo and not so effective.
---
It was annoying but profitable.  I just wish once you have no caps that revenge isnt an option.  We had to server hop once they stopped dropping caps
---
You got Raider Excavator, the diamond eyes face paint and Blood Stained combat armor geeez Bethesda was basically Santa Claus for your post apocalyptic needs, now leave me alone so I can run around in my summer shorts, pineapple fruit headdress, my pink pipboy with my 2076 glasses and matching pink armor on while I make home with my new red stove in my house with my the pink castle bed, floral floors, flower patterned door, and my pink rug. If anyone dares to attack my camp while I’m watering my succulents I’m hopping into my Playtime power armor and beating the holy living crap out of them with my pink whiffle ball bat skin so they better not mess up my megaton hairdo becuase I’ll go back and cry about it to my Beta fish in my lamp.
---
I'd say 50 cal, though the ammo is a bit more rare.
---
Gatling gun is nice because it's a bit slower so you're not just spraying everywhere, and the ammo is stupid cheap.
---
How do you claim it?
---
The 50 Cal Machine Gun has literally one mod, which is the heavy barrel.
---
Do you mean legendary effects or armor type?
---
How come it can’t tell me like “warning, group recommended!” like other MMOs? I was all gung ho to wrap up that questline myself and was promptly flattened
---
Both in a sense, more so what legendary effects
---
You can get it from Target for 29AUD. Definitely worth it.
---
Also the charred ghouls seem to take less damage from my first bayonets strike then more from the following hits. The weapon is an instigating Combat  shotty with extra bash damage.
---
Check out the washers and the note on it
---
I think the 50cal is higher dps(?) but I love my gatling gun. My 50cal chews through ammo really fast, the gatling has great ammo conservation and zero recoil. Personal preference though.
---
Yeah, but I'm looking for raw damage output, I'm going to run bandolier and ammosmith anyway, so ammo shouldn't be as big a issue
---
That's quite interesting, I've noticed my attacks not connecting but it's hard to tell if that's lag, a bug or something else. Luckily I don't run into these too often, cheers
---
thats cool af
---
same here...always fun when you raid a silo and after all stimpak bullets and time spending for blast a nuclear bomb you get a freeze and it close.....after you need to wait 24h to relunch a blast....so nice...
---
Only they know for sure, I suppose.
---
I don't normally comment on posts, I'm more of a big time lurker but this has to be one of my favourite comparison posts! Being from Australia and not having the travel bug I won't ever see WV so to see these photos and to see just how much work Bethesda put into making FO76 so bloody realistic is truly amazing
---
Props to your wife for the great photography and for you getting all the poses down! My favourite part of this post is reading how you knew your way around Greenbrier without ever being there, just from (what I assume to be) farming Whitesprings!
---
Thank you for sharing this with us!
---
They dropped a lot of effects from fo4 including irradiated
---
Well base armor BOS combat armor has the highest DR. If you want to have maxed damage then get a bloodied weapon with a combination of unyielding and bolstering to really up your melee damage if you run radicool and nerd rage as well with the adrenal reaction mutation you will have crazy high damage and with the perk in luck that gives you 45% chance to avoid damage at low hp you will actually be pretty tanky.  If you're on ps4 I might have some stuff for sale that might help you out depending on what you want to go with
---
The guy who was mad needs to improve on his social skills..we're not in first grade anymore
---
I mean if they keep making 20lb reward weapons for the weekly survival challenges that I collect becuase I’m OCD in collecting everything rare that they are going to really have to, because more heavy guns are coming next month too :(
---
50 cal hands down
---
Scorched event is still fun tho
---
You must gather your Wendigos before venturing forth
---
I am paranoid from back when people would try and trade with you to see if they think they can beat you in pvp so I just say no to random trades unless it's like a level 2 trying to sell me beer bottles for a few caps lol
---
I still can't relate to this. I rename all of the legendary armor I keep (20+ pieces) to keep track of effects, along with a set of every power armor in the game. I have 36 legendary weapons on me at all times because I'm a hoarder. I keep *ONE OF EVERY SINGLE COSMETIC OUTFIT I HAVE EVER FOUND* in my stash box.
---
Despite all this, to this date I have not noticed a single item go missing
---
I have one
---
Yeah, but wouldn't it be better to get a TSE Handmade then with a prime automatic mod?
---
Remember pvp ensues only if u fight back..there is a vulnerability at your base tho..I'm happy mine is hidden and not really in the open..im not a fan of random trading anymore
---
that sucks, which other effects did they drop?
---
Yeah, it didn't carry over. Neverending also became quad and double. Many effects are still in the game files as tier 4 or tier 5 though, it's just that those are not currently obtainable
---
Thanks for checking it out.👍
---
What? You were the one that tried to claim me calling out a possible pedo that was trying to claim 14 was the age of consent in america, was calling oxhorn a pedo. Then after I pointed out that no, I was talking about a commenter in that thread, you still are hung up on this age of consent shit.
---
They offer to trade so they can check out what gear you are using. It's a way to size up someone before you fight them. I'm sure the Dousche nozzle was gonna start pvp no matter what.
---
There’s this ridiculous glitch that makes the base of my barn irremovable. So it’s kinda stuck there forever. I have my power armor station in there though
---
This is a fantastic idea. WoW has been doing it forever.
---
I doubt it would happen to everyone, otherwise people would never play at all. That said, it does happen. Out of curiosity, what platform you play on ?
---
Me too! I see it in other camps I visit also. Not sure there's anything we can do, it's up t9 Bethesda. Xbox one.
---
I asked if you were calling oxhorn a pedophile. I asked if I had it wrong. I was making sure i didn't misunderstand you. All I said was that dude who said that crap wasn't entirely wrong sadly. That doesn't mean I agree with him. Then you go off on me asking if I'm defending that shit. Are you kidding me??
---
Just because I try and see something from all sides doesn't mean I'm condoning shit. This world has its imperfections. It does no good to ignore them
---
I'm saying no it doesn't slip through the cracks, you legally can not get a marriage licenses if you are under 18 unless a JUDGE signs off on it.
---
Once again, this has nothing to do with oxhorn being a scumbag that tries to censor others. So why not get back on topic?
---
This. You will see notably better results with hitscan weapons, like The Brotherhood Rifle &amp; Handmade. Stopped using Gauss alltogether.
---
I applaud you in that case
---
Dude buy it from market subs they are like 200 caps
---
Well we fought back because we knew we could beat them and all our bases where close by lol. Cant wait till the base immunity is added
---
So I failed everyone. Got a little distracted with the wife. I’ll be in tonight around 530pm to start. I apologize
---
Not particularly valuable, but it is the most well rounded shotgun if you're doing a shotguns build
---
Cant remember but a lot, they might still bring them back since theres 5 slots for legendary effects
---
What does that have to do with oxhorn being a scumbag that censors others?
---
Amazing
---
That's what I assumed. Guy was running a standard cav assassin set with an aa DC gauntlet.  Easy pickings for our guys and his buddy was a bloodied rifle build even easier.  Killed them like 20 times to then killing me twice. But they wouldn't go away.
---
Hey man I’m also on Xbox and looking for this... I’d feel bad if you did it for free so can I give you... 100 caps?
---
Oh yeah that was a no-brainer..especially with your friends..im saying ..if you are chilling alone at your base..and a douche shows up..immunity? Nice..I didn't kno that was forthcoming..thanks
---
Bloodied is better than TS afaik. But yeah Handmade is a great choice.
---
They just need a nice mix of both tbh.
---
Adventure or Survival?
---
I like the Fire Axe, been playing as the Fire breathers and i’ve been hitting the Burrows when I was level 35 and I already hit level 45.
---
Ah thx
---
A quick counter to that. If you have skins on your weapons and armor, they do not show up in the trade menu. I just keep my goodies painted up so no one knows:)
---
Kk
---
Never seen the mod for sale anywhere in game.
---
So it took scrapping about 50+ level actions before I actually got the suppressor mod to unlock. Just got about 2 days ago....
---
This is so dope..I'm on the East Coast and I honestly considered heading out to WV
---
Adventure I dont even think revenge is a thing in survival.  Basically if they take revenge in adventure you are automatically hostile for them so your flagged for pvp with them even if you keep killing them
---
Me too.
---
And I said no I was talking about the idiot that thought 14 was the age of consent in america for sex. IT ISN'T the age of consent in america is 16, across the country. NOWHERE is it under 16 in america. 
---
The marriage age might be younger, BUT that is only with a judge signing off and the parents signing off. It isn't just some, "oh a pedo wants to marry a 10 year old. Just has to go get a marriage liscense and he can." The only way to get married under the age of 18 requires a parental sign off, AND a judical one, and no judge is going to sign off on a pedo marrying a child.
---
This looks like it was very fun. Well done on your wife's part lining up the shots too!
---
Also gives disease resistance
---
Same I get a disease from a ghoul almost every time it’s very annoying
---
Gatling Plasma
---
I legit cannot find the eggs in build mode at all. I've looked in every tab. I've searched all the floor decor and cannot find it can anyone help 😁
---
The event location isn’t usually 1 of the possible hours locations . Open your map and you will see 5(it’s supposed to be 4) yellow circles that are the possible locations
---
I think the solution here is to just have a Spotify playlist. There are tons of Fallout themed playlists out there, and every platform supports Spotify.
---
It likely reduces damage before it compares it to damage resistance meaning, it might just be that effective at minimizing damage.
---
Not sure why people are hating, its like another whitesprings in my opinion. I get like 2 or 3 legendary weapons every run.
---
Why do you PvP in Adventure and then complain about the mechanics then?
---
We have a recruitment compound set up near vault 76 for our discord server so our bases arent hidden.  We are trying to help out new players
---
I like the spikes and it's a great weapon, but one mod seems excessively small. Be cool of it could have rocket/powered/flaming heads like the sledgehammer.
---
Alas, the fool is very well aware of this and camped near the corpse for a few minutes, repeatedly checking for loot that never came
---
100% looks like a mr gutsy, but acts/talks like robobrain.
---
We dont loon for pvp. This is people attacking our bases while they can still be attacked and such. We where just chilling building stuff and they started shooting our shit.
---
Oh cool, I’m level 56
---
I’m on Xbox, maybe there’s a correlation.
---
Yeah. I've had run ins like that before. What sucks is when you get the guys that are glitching and no matter what you do you cant hurt them.
---
Or a GTA style changing room where you could view the clothes. I like that you can view most atomic shop items in the camp build menu now, although you still can't see them without the "unbuildable" hue on them.
---
Didn't r have a crits grant Ap one?
---
One time I got rad worms just from a diseased ghoul breathing on me. The infection rate is ridiculous.
---
Except it's the same guy who did the voice of Biv which makes Marcus ..... Biv Negan
---
I have had stuff like this happen a few times. I just feel like they shouldnt be able to keep coming back. I am not usaly looking for pvp. I would be in survival if I was but sometimes you get pulled in and win but they wont stop lol
---
This. If we are lucky there will be a few items to put on normal shelves. But probably not. 
---
I'm guessing we'll get bobblehead stand, weapon and armor racks, and maybe a display for teddy  bears. And that's it.
---
Wearing a Combat Helmet with a Gas Mask (the non-goggles variant) gives you a headpiece similar to it - other than that the only way to get it was from beta and PC Dev room
---
Yeah request someone to add it for u..I'm a rifle build the lever is so loud lol..my favorite gun in the game
---
It’s their fault for all the RNG stuff. If I have too check multiple Power Armor chassis’ for a full set of t-51b then I’ll be taking from the same amount of areas anyway. Whether it’s different spots on the same server or the same spots on different servers. Maybe someone could make a mod that adds this too the pip-boy though?
---
Noticed something: Repairing an item through the new “Workbench/Repair” option causes the info box to stop displaying stats for items until you exit and return to the workbench. Anyone else?
---
I think I'm late to the party, what's junk decorating?
---
Can the bases still be damaged if the owner has PvP switched off?
---
I mean the location of it. But i found it now. Thanks for help?
---
I'm confused what do you mean exactly?
---
Currently yes but the next update that changes
---
Just wanted to note that talons applied to the power fist, which is already one of the strongest melee weapons in the game.
---
Using junk from your stash to decorate your camp
---
I don't really think that just imo people should be more grateful for things they get for free
---
Changing the UI won't help with people being rude
---
I'm on PC unfortunately, thank you for the info though, I'm in the middle of re doing all my perks again, I got all my strength ones sorted but was running a mix of melee and rifles but wanting to switch to full melee
---
I still remember how useless the Vaporization Mozzle in Flamer. Basically it made the flamer more... melee than ever and many was bothered in FO4 for how useless the Flamer Range is until someone pointed out that the Vaporization Nozzle made the Flamer range too short that it worth meeleing an enemy than to set them ablaze. If you only have the standard nozzle installed though it can reach far when fully upgraded.
---
I don’t know if it applies in FO76 since I only have the large Fuel Barrel mod.
---
Worst part is you can’t collect your brown paper bag goodies when you die In there :(
---
Seems to be. I've noticed some people get really irritated if you dont accept their trade offer. While I haven't had my camp actually destroyed completely they are noticeably aggro.
---
Not sure why. If I offered a trade and someone refused so be it. But I guess it's just the way of the wasteland.
---
Although I do wonder if it is simply the remotes that have some bearing. The one for no is a bit off - thumbs up then turning down. I feel that a bit rude. The angry one is closer to polite but we all know its angry so could be taken wrongly. And just ignoring is kind of rude too. Perhaps this may be alleviated somewhat if there was a more polite emote for saying sorry I dont want to trade.
---
Hey I'll send you a pic of the Welcome to Welch sign, I live maybe 5 minutes from it
---
Well bloodied is definitely the current go too for crazy melee damage
---
&gt; We want cool looking mad max shit. 
---
I want the cool looking Mad Max one-arm leather jacket.  I wore it in Fallout 1.
---
Nice..yeah the forest is an amazing area for a camp..most of the time tho..the idiots aren't around
---
Sounds good, I'll try and work around that then :) 
---
Just gotta hope for those decent rolls now
---
I feel like this is 300% a requirement for legendaries if we are too keep the crap drop chances for 3 stars and stuff. And 99.9999999999999% if they get fixed but if the tokens allow me too move legendary effects from weapons then I’m OK too keep just finding new weapons and giving them all the affects.
---
Yeah need more emmots
---
Good luck
---
I was teamed up with friends farming events
---
Yeah cant wait till people cant destroy them. I have never had a problem with that till yesterday lol
---
I play on xb1, and this was happening to me on the second egg. Every time I check it was never there. However I found I had it quit out of the game, (normally I would hold down xb button on controller and shutdown from fo76 main menu when finished for the day) and back to the home, to load up the game again, and it would show. I have done this everyday with no problems, shown every time.
---
Was on a team once and these idiots destroyed my friends base at WS..that was only once..in my base nothing is locked so I hope that prevents ppl from messing with it
---
Muzzle brake makes the value go up so i
---
I assume it is better than the compensator. The suppressor makes the weapon silent with reduced range and durability.
---
But how do they know that they are “their” ghouls and not ghouls that spawned because another new player entered the area?  It’s hard to actually own enemies in a high traffic and public area.  Turret vamps do suck though.
---
People are weird. Can never guess what they will do lol
---
U got one star anti armor or bloodied weapons
---
Server stability. Can't have 20 giant camps stuffed with stuff.
---
Have you guys heard they’re releasing a new egg every day, and if you get them all, you win a prize? 
---
Competitive people might class getting that prize as winning. Whilst the eggs are technically free, there is an old adage that says "time is money", it takes time to log in and buy these eggs, ergo: eggs is money. 
---
PAY2WIN!!!! Oh my god Bethesda why you liiieeeeeee!
---
didn't know this. I have a newfound love for my plasma Gatling. good thing my heavys weight less than every other weapon so I'm carrying all my heavy weapons to spare space in my stash. I'll keep the Gatling and .50 with ammo on standby for the end!
---
When was the last time you picked up and replaced your C. A. M. P.  The level up budget increases are only applied when you re-set down your C. A. M. P.  So if you have not picked up your camp in 20+ levels you could be missing a lot of budget increases showing up.
---
This is the best one of these I’ve seen
---
I am not home but I have a level 40 anti armor power fist, and a level 50 (I think) anti armor lead pipe. 
---
My bloodied weapon is a level 35 lever action rifle.
---
I'm on PC, but how is it double xp? I thought that was next weekend?
---
Oh it’s been some time since I last picked my camp up
---
Horde events also have a path they follow so by the time you fast travel there they are most likey farther on down their set path
---
I remember a player wanting to trade - he had a camp setup near the Green Lodge and I bumped into him as I was passing by the motel.  I figured I’d play along and see if he had anything useful.  I give him points for effort - he was in full RP mode and had built a lovely counter into his camp for trades.
---
Except despite my telling him what I was interested in, he kept loading the trade window with garbage, and ridiculous prices, to boot.  Shotgun shells for higher than what I could get at a vendor, never mind crafting them myself.  I complimented him on his camp and wished him well, but declined any further trading.
---
He launched into a full-on tantrum.  Why did I waste his time, he cried?  He was devoting precious time to me when others were waiting on him, he bemoaned.  I looked around and confirmed we were the only ones within miles.  I suppose someone may have been hiding as they waited to buy this guy’s junk.
---
He took a few swings at me, and I accepted his challenge.  He closed up his shop (shutters) and then taunted me from inside his camp.  I made short work of his two turrets, then proceeded to knock a hole in his camp.  I chased him into Flatwoods before I lost him and he logged out.
---
He proceeded to send me several messages, calling me a griefer.  I reminded him he attacked me and he was the one perpetuating the interactions.
---
So you’re right - trading with random players can definitely have its drawbacks!
---
Got turrets?
---
Or basically get rid of some stuff 
---
I have/had (rebuilding) a 3 story camp built against a dam so only 3 sides for walls and lots of decorations and lights ect and have never had an issue with space
---
But I don't try and shove one of every possible thing into it
---
If you have that small of a camp and running out of space (not to sound mean) it's gotta look like a cluttered mess
---
Very much sooooo!
---
I've been sitting on top of the hut for 45min no one shows up, still have the activation key from the questline...
---
This is already a thing that is coming....
---
I think this is a great idea.  Even if the vending itself  is problematic, it will provide a way to showcase your architectural design.
---
Same issue, PC.
---
Broccolate milk to chicken milk
---
I have a trader character and definitely dont get mad if people dont buy. That's life lol.
---
I planned out a shotguns build to level up during the 2xp weekend coming up and there were a lot of leftover perks. Luck is definitely the way to go with shotguns to make up for the power dps
---
West tek isn't very secret anymore.  It's always got people there in my experience.  Great place to farm. It has lots of good stuff.
---
False tested this out, no damage increase on laser pistol to laser rifle.
---
They will hopefully implement no damage to player based prior to this.  They just mentioned that in the last Inside the Vault so I'm guessing you won't have to get about your second concern
---
Oh hell naw. I don’t take offense, but it’s by no means a cluttered mess. I’ve put over 12 hours carefully perfecting it. It’s just got a lot of stuff in it. Also, I only have one turret
---
I was playing off the fact that a lot of people say that this game is just a money grab...perhaps if they realize the camp limit is making them loose money they will increase it sooner rather than later.
---
This could probably do without telling players how to cheese it up at the Whitespring or server hop West Tek. I remember a few weeks back when these write ups were telling players to cheese it up and server hop at Watoga and then you saw players on every server you went to cheesing it up at Watoga until they nerfed Watoga to death.
---
Survival tips = Good
---
Cheesing tips = Bad
---
It's used for many power armor mods, prime receivers (which take more flux for the ammo), the decontamination arch, and a few other end game things. Personally, I don't bother with the prime receivers any more, normal weapons seem to pack as much punch as I need and I don't care to farm nuke zones for ammo to farm nuke zones, and it's generally easier to farm for the mods from vendors than buy the plans and then craft them, so if you're not a hardcore min/max player, they're not used for much.
---
UGH are you kidding me? This is BETHESDA we're talking about here. They can't even code their own game right lol. Remember, modders and Redditors are better at scripting than they are lol. If you think Bethesda can actually make something work, you're out to lunch man. UGH I hate Bethesda ugh. UGh why can't reddit just make fallout? Why can't they just give us why they want?! I mean we ARE The consumers, they should do exactly as we say or we will start a revolution and FUCK bethesda in the ass. UGH. 
---
\- Reddit.
---
Yeah, I was going to say, you *can* preview them in the build mode at your CAMP.  You just can't place them unless you buy them.
---
Lmao go play rust, trust me there is no game like it.
---
I know you didn't ask but, Yes I did get around to making that hat
---
[tinfoil hat](https://imgur.com/8ZU7uHs)
---
I'm on PC. My game has been crashing as often as it was during the beta, and for a solid month or two crashes were rare. Gonna try a fresh game install, haven't tried this yet.
---
The person who posted about it didn't mention how that process works. I've only gotten 3 myself. I can look and see if anyone has posted about how to actually claim it.
---
Xbox unfortunately
---
Mod: Spikes + With real Fire
---
Although I know Energy and Melee damage doesn’t work well together
---
Yeah but its good at base level.
---
I sell you any serum you want. Justet me know. They are cheap.
---
The people around were surprisingly cool with it; however my better judgement told me not to wear it at the Greenbrier.
---
Mirrors are doorways to parallel dimensions! This is nothing new!
---
Try picking your C. A. M. P. up (not stirring everything in building mode) and resetting it. You should be able to do that in the same location and see some budget increases from your level. It is a common reminder on many of the C.A. M. P. Building videos, but not common knowledge throughout the wasteland. 
---
Hope that helps you out. 👍
---
It is an amazing place and highly recommended
---
Oh man, hit the right server and you can be swimming in 1*Wood legs. 
---
 West Tek is far and away my most successful place for good stuff
---
. Whitesprings has more but the ghoul loot table is terrible. 
---
 Apalachia Antiques, R&amp;G and Generals steakhouse rarely has any, but it only takes a minute or so to clear out. 
---
 Harpers and Robco is so so, and is usually the tipping point, if they have legendaries I'll probably stop on the server for another loop. 
---
 Keep an eye out on map for Horde events, always a legendary, and AWOL at Robco has also been kind to me.
---
I can add it for you. GT BLUBLZRedeux
---
Yeah, that's the damage bug. Welcome to the club. :)
---
I'll buy the lever
---
I have one but won’t be on for another 3 hours, if you can’t find one let me know.
---
But a place to see them fully built and to walk up to the clothes and see all the way around them is the feel I’m wanting
---
Sounds good to me. Ill be on in 15-20 minutes my GT is : SCVMcormick
---
I’m so paranoid of a trade being a setup to a trap or something. When I first started off I was maybe level 14 or 15 and a level 60+ in power armor came up to me near Grafton and asked to trade, said he had some stuff he didn’t need anymore.
---
True to his word he had a lvl 15 legendary laser rifle he didn’t need anymore and we bartered a bit over the cost, settled on 250 caps for the rifle plus ammo. Everything was cordial and we parted ways. Was a pretty cool experience, much more interesting than the vendor bot
---
We were actually visiting family near the Virginia/West Virginia border and had rented a cabin for the week, which served as our base of operations. Off the top of my head I don't know where to get good scrapple, but if I think of anywhere I'll let you know.
---
Instead of more damage make it even faster!
---
Yaay! Haven't found one yet. Add me when you can log later: Fynchie
---
My "best" Whitesprings nuke haul was 83 legendaries. One 3* weapon and all others were junk that I sold to vendor.
---
Sometimes the RNG just hates you.
---
2* items seem to me be even rarer than 3*,go figure that.
---
It's not just the horde events that are bugged. Stationary events as well but not all.
---
I won’t spoil it for you, but a little hint. It’s in the armor workbench, just toggle the non-craftable items.
---
Yeah, the Whitesprings portion was very unreal. I half expected to see a Mr Handy at every turn.
---
Or the tesla rifle which turns it in to a endless loading type of dust. This is the sole reason I don't use my tesla.
---
The person who posted it doesn't know for certain that's actually what it is.
---
Anytime I trade people just always immediately request my AAE lever action and I immediately back out and say good bye
---
I sent u a DM with my psn
---
Wish I was on ps4
---
We got a good discord server with planty of people if your interested
---
I'm actually gonna be frustrated if it IS something cool, because I didn't get the game until after the free Easter egg event started, so I haven't been able to get all 6.
---
What I meant was that if you have to actually stumble upon people's camps to access their vending machines.
---
If they actually create a dedicated hub for this it's going to help a lot.
---
I don't think it's the same thing but FWIW I have a Marine Tactical Helmet. Makes my toon look like a bug.
---
I mean, cryptids as a whole are pretty out there. There's nothing to back them up but witness reports. Just on that alone, they're all valid to be in the game.
---
So many incels can't even grasp the concept of talking to your partner about how you spend your budget. It would be sad if it weren't so gad dern funny.
---
You act like all the world is moral and just. Some people do slip through the cracks with shitty parents and not all judges are just. You're hung up on the world moving along in a just way when it doesn't always. 
---
I asked for clarification. I wanted to be sure i was reading it right. I wasn't reading it right. You're the one saying I was absolutely accusing you of calling ox a pedo.
---
I'm not hung up on the age of consent (I did say it was between 16 and 18, you can see that yourself). It was the age of marriage which is waaay to low.  I'm saying what that man is claiming does happen whether you like to think it does or not.
---
All that was because you asked why I was defending pedophilia. Acknowledging shitty young ages for marriage does NOT mean I condone pedophilia. Spreading awareness of this horrible shit helps to keep people aware of the not okay things that do happen.
---
This all started because I gave you my view of the situation with ox and how hateful you were being about the situation. 
---
You completely ignore the hateful part and then go on a crusade to show me how wrong I am. With circumstantial evidence at best, the videos are clearly from biased people. Someone doesn't agree with you so you just argue until they do? The world is full of differences of opinion. It's okay to agree to disagree. 
---
I've tried, was it once or twice, to end this convo and agree to disagree but doesn't seem enough for you since I don't agree with you.
---
I think I made a discord account, but being old and feeble minded I was unable to make use of it.
---
From what I heard, Gatling Plasma is horrible
---
I'd really like to see a better solution for this too.  I didn't even realize until recently that it was over-encumbrance which limited where you could respawn, because I wasn't over-encumbered when I died.  I just thought it was a bug that sometimes, my *only* option was Vault 76.  But you're right, because certain weight reduction perks wear off when you die, the game decides you are over-encumbered.
---
Supposedly, this is something that came up several months ago and Bethesda declared it was fixed in one of the early patches.
---
One thing I'd like to see is a reformatting of the weight counter on the Pip-Boy so it displayed your normal weight + bonus carry weight.  When you use things like Radicool and Adrenal Reaction, your carry weight fluctuates a *lot*.  And it doesn't help that there's often some lag in recomputing that from time to time.
---
i think they’d have to increase the server size first, because with only 24 people or less per server a trading hub like that could end up being pretty empty. or maybe have a trading hub as a dedicated server, then everyone who wants to trade can trade there without having to worry if other people on the server show up or not
---
Isn't Gatling Plasma bad?
---
I went to a weird scorched earth event where there were no players and the queen was fighting a col. Gutsy. The gutsy was winning.
---
Nothing worse than her getting 'gooified'
---
I see this working out, for sure. You know they don't actually go to "get their nails done" right? Lol. It's probably the Uber cost to get to her real man's house.
---
Nope, they're rifles even without the stock. Only stuff that *starts* as a pistol can work like this.
---
Yeah it's ok though, I still 1 shot every mob with my BoS rifle and my Bloodied handmade makes short work of anything bigger. Not really needing the power, would just be neat to get something else for a change.
---
I have stopped clicking these on for precisely this reason. No circles. No markers. No mobs.
---
The handmade has a nice rof. It doesn't bounce much when shooting. It's just a quality gun. People also mod it for auto and it shreds.
---
Got a smart phone it's real easy. It's just a chat room basically we use to form groups and set up events. We have over 100 members between ps4 xbox and PC
---
This is awesome. Thanks so much for sharing this!!!
---
I'm concerned about the vending machine being too tall for one floor. At least it looks that way in the intro video.
---
Hahaha
---
Yes, make deathclaws great again, am I right?
---
This would be really cool.
---
Nice, indeed I do.
---
Complete opposite for me. By level 45 I was hunting bats.
---
All you need is the app and I can send you an invite link once your in our members can help ya out with the rest
---
You're the reason why ppl crouch all the time
---
Yeah I am surprised this has never been fixed, it has been around since launch and I agree they can teleport across lakes, jump canyons and just do whatever their AI wants. I have seen them spawn through concrete as well. While I guess its not a high priority fix, they are one of the most annoying things in the game!
---
That’s really.
---
A week ago I leveled up from 32 to 33. On my 33rd birthday. And while I was having a birthday bash at my WS Station party CAMP!
---
I didn't plan it and didn't realise until someone asked me how old I was and then saw my level!
---
Fortunately he quit and turned on me instead else we'd be dealing with a gutsy with anti armor and explosive vents.
---
Make it like the flaming pitchfork.
---
This is fantastic!!!
---
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. I've tried that trick before and it had the same outfits both times. Wouldn't have minded if they'd been good outfits.
---
It's a rifle
---
If you want to maximize your damage, then you'll want Unyielding as each piece of Unyielding armor increases your Strength as your health decreases past 50% or so and Strength adds a damage bonus to melee.  Consequently, this can make you into a glass cannon - at its peak, you can gain an extra 15 points of Strength, which is twice what you normally have, but you'll be running around at very low health.
---
There are certain pieces of armor that go by Sentinel and Cavalier.  Sometimes it's part of the name, often it's not.  These are secondary effects - the "Reduce incoming damage by 15% when standing still/sprinting."  You won't see them unless you Inspect the armor.  In some ways, the presence of those trumps whatever the main prefix is, because who can say no to armor that offers flat, guaranteed damage reduction?
---
Installed it.
---
So do the Enclave events too. Uranium fever shows up in the mountains up near top of the world when it is in the black water mines...When I am down south east over by site C I still get quest invites for the amusement park.
---
I’m level 200 and have seen the jet pack twice. And have seen calibrated shocks only once. I have entered the bunker nearly every single session I’ve ever been in.
---
Imagine if it comes with the update on 23rd.
---
Here here
---
Im waiting to see. Have avoided any info as I can. Of course I have an idea what it is but I still like surprises so Ill wait to see exactly :D
---
Wait- is this it l the random responder eye bot? I'm not familiar with a vendor selling unique apparel.  Now I'm sad I missed out!
---
Yes, it's a thing, helped a player out defending his workshop site today, and soon after emotes "trade" to me, to which I emoted "no", cue 10 seconds or so of him punching me with his power-fist, I just kept emoting "help" because he can't hurt me, it's pretty hilarious, and screams impatient child to me.  
---
Oh and I also have had it happen at my CAMP, more than once, now I just log-off and back in.  
---
What is wrong with people, not just in games, that can't accept no, when you have a choice of how to answer them. Childish.
---
I always seem to attract them when I open up my pip boy for an extended period of time
---
Alright TheIrishOctopus will invite you in a few minutes... coffee first
---
Do you suppose they've tweaked the RNG for disease? I swear it's happening way more than a few weeks ago.
---
I feel like its getting worse since the survival changes.  They are crawling back to adventure
---
What seems to work is server hop 10-15 times then wait 30-60 minutes. If you server hop lots of times you'll get placed in one of the servers you've already been into.
---
To make the server hopping a bit more bearable combine it with the technical data quest.
---
Lastly, you should know that the jetpack isn't actually that good, it's more of a status/bragging rights kind of item. Don't be too sad about it.
---
I've seen it once or twice but have never been able to afford it. What platform are you on? If you ask around you can probably find someone that'll craft it for you if you provide the materials
---
Had a guy that wanted my tse lever. Wouldn't stop following trying to start a trade than came the area chat with him threatening to to blow up my camp
---
Well, it's not the dog food.  More likely than not, you're getting it from Ghouls or Mole Rats, which have a very high chance of infecting you and are almost unavoidable sometimes.  There is a Vaccinated perk in Endurance that can reduce this, but I tend to just live with it.
---
You can't sell Disease Cures to vendors for whatever reason, so you might as well use them if the disease annoys you.
---
Yeah, that's coming in the next patch, might help to dissuade grouchy players who come knocking, "Trade?" - "No. Away with you child!"
---
I genuinely started a second account to try as many builds as possible. I mostly steer away from obvious builds too. Less combat orientated one's are quit fun.
---
I got one egg on the first day this started...no more eggs appear in my atomic shop now..
---
I don’t blame you. I have an AA VATS hit% + reduced VATS cost radium rifle, it’s my pride and joy. I’d never part with it
---
You ought to grab a mining suit and helmet to go along with it.
---
how childish can people be lol
---
This is the counter issue to the people that keep saying, "get legendary armor with weight reduction effects". They don't work when wearing power armor. Those people think everybody is supposed to play a bloodied unyielding no power armor build and run around with TSE shotguns. I ignore those people.
---
anything set in stone for the trader by the way? for example i have a couple of weapons that are lower level and three star and i dont have a mule or much space left :(  am i best off saving them or am i best off loading them and going for higher level three stars to turn in?
---
Yeah, descriptions for unarmed are a bit vague. I made the same mistake.
---
Lol. They should just make a new game mode called greifer where they can all just go play how they want there
---
Sorry, this is a naive and extraneous 'suggestion'. It's not 'this or that'.
---
Pc
---
This is probably the best answer I've seen.
---
I just want to have a look at the artillery on the roof of Defiance, haha
---
Godd  Howard  had already done too much for me by putting that glow in the dark map int the atomic shop.    And now this? It is simply an  embarrassment of riches.
---
I'd recommend messaging your anchor friend. I've done this a few times without messaging, mostly with success but that one time they server hop the same time as you switch is annoying.
---
I always take a look at their karma points and only trade with people who replies on the post
---
The master horde I was referring to was the horde the event is for. As the other locations sometimes have different types of enemies.
---
Next stop, Vegas!
---
Or how about Bethesda change the shit so that ash/goo piles won't f****n float in air. That's so infuriating bug.
---
Its stuff like this ruins it. I got killed with a Mr handy buzzblade in under a second and I can only guess it was bloodied.
---
But either way I was in full power armour and full health, guy stands right near me and claims my workshop. I have no time to respond and die. 
---
 All damage boost leg effects should not count in pvp.
---
I could really do with a  "Learn the definition of No, here's a dictionary, assuming you can read that is" (That's way too long for an emote, but it's how I feel with some people in FO76.)  
---
Maybe a few more signs for the CAMP,  "No Trading" "No children" or a "No hoomans!" audio clip from Grahm.
---
* They won't give you complete freedom to set your own price.
---
* They limit what you can sell, not just the quantity, but *what*.
---
* An early exploit that lets users drain your vending machine and pay nothing.
---
Easier said than done. But honestly, auction houses are less immersive and boring. If they do player stores well, they will be far more rewarding gameplay wise.
---
Got a buddy who always puts is stuff up for max caps when they request something not for sale. I'm waiting for the day someone actually buys it lol
---
It's the only weapon I carry no idea why they think I would be selling it lol
---
Targeting a limb using VATS in PVP is somewhat difficult, I don't think it's the strategy you want to use. Limb damage will help a lot in Scorchbeast Queen fights. Target the wings to get her to land, if you cripple the wing she will stay down on the ground.
---
Yup I try to avoid item trading outside reddit too many shady people
---
Yeah exactly
---
That's Survival surely?
---
Could you send me a link as well?  I’m running in to the same issues and would love to run more endgame stuff
---
Thx buddy
---
I agree it’s op and I don’t think it should go up to this amount of damage but if someone abuses it, it gets too far
---
Trueeee
---
They dont want a game mode where people can kill them freely.  They have to only be able to fight people they can one hit so survival isnt for them
---
&gt;You act like all the world is moral and just. Some people do slip through the cracks with shitty parents and not all judges are just. You're hung up on the world moving along in a just way when it doesn't always.
---
&gt;I asked for clarification. I wanted to be sure i was reading it right. I wasn't reading it right. You're the one saying I was absolutely accusing you of calling ox a pedo.
---
You are the one that twisted the conversation I was having with someone to twist it into a way you could assume it was about scumboxhorn, that is your problem not mine.
---
&gt;All that was because you asked why I was defending pedophilia. Acknowledging shitty young ages for marriage does NOT mean I condone pedophilia. Spreading awareness of this horrible shit helps to keep people aware of the not okay things that do happen.
---
When you are spreading misinformation and incorrect things? Yeah I'm going to be suspect on why you keep trying to make it sound like it is something that happens commonly, because that is exactly what pedos do. They literally try to make it seem common and normal and happens all the time. IT DOESN'T. There is no "falling through the cracks" like you say. Sure maybe that happend 30 years ago. But times have changed, and so have the laws.
---
&gt;This all started because I gave you my view of the situation with ox and how hateful you were being about the situation. 
---
Hating a bigot isn't being hateful, especially a bigot who tries to censor people that call him out. If you are cool with him being a homophobe, that is on you. His "response" video was garbage because he claims "oh I don't feel that way anymore" yet less than 8 months ago he was still making those comments. 
---
What actually is the case is, oxhorn knows that if he continues to show his bigotry he will be rightfully destroyed, so he made a response "oh I don't think like that anymore." Sure he doesn't, that's why he still compared homosexuals to pedophiles.
---
The reason I'm not even talking about that anymore is because he did make a response about it. If you want to believe him that is up to you, I'm not going to believe him because it is literally the exact same response you hear every time someone gets caught being a shitty person.
---
I am not mentioning that anymore because he did make a response to those issues, he still didn't respond to the biggest issue most people have with him though, which is still the report abuse. Which he won't address because he is in the wrong and there is no way for him to respond in a way that will save his reputation, which is fully on him. His actions is what is causing this backlash. 
---
There are tons of great fallout creators much bigger than oxhorn that didn't pull the garbage he has, such as shoddycast, rangerdave, MaTN, etc. So I'm not expecting oxhorn to be perfect or anyone to be perfect. I DO expect people I support to not be abusing the report system and not being bigots. That isn't expecting someone to be perfect, just to not be a terrible person.
---
Sure
---
Is a protectron but yeah, that one.
---
I'm not going to speculate, best to wait until it's implemented and we can see how it is.
---
It makes perfect sense to me. It's more common to say April 4th than the 4th of April. So it seems to make sense to write it the same way.
---
I saw it three times in the same week months ago an haven't seen it since.   The RNG is really awful.   Having said, that, I'd just skip the X01 jet pack and use T51 as go  to power armor.    Inferior to X01 in rad resistance and that's it.  You can buy a jet pack for that from brotherhood vendor and it has also been dropping from the Scorched Beast queen lately.
---
It costs 5800 caps wit hard bargain and requires stable flux, which makes it headache to get but  still doable to anyone willing to grind.
---
It will allow people full control over your stash instead of just the items you marked for sale (with all non-sale items at 0 caps or vendor price or something)
---
It will only allow you to charge per item, so you still can't sell most kinds of ammo reasonably (this will most likely actually be the case)
---
Bought items will have a 50/50 chance of either disappearing or being duped
---
I was waiting to hear how you nuked WV.
---
If I remember correctly, I scrapped them at a weapons workbench. I scrapped and ultracite power armor and each of the pieces of the power armor itself appeared in my inventory after scrapping its chassis. However this was before the renaming update
---
You need to completely close the game or else the atomic shop doesn’t reset and show new items.
---
"Well yes, but actually no" ?
---
I can craft a couple for you at 200% durability so they will have 18 DR. You can scrap one to learn to make them, and keep the other to use. IGN: jchamlin
---
I've actually done something similar with FO:NV.  I live in Vegas and have joked about finding raiders or Deathclaws when I go hiking up in Red Rock.
---
Fuck the ants! I can four hit high level enemies but takes me a dozen to best the ants.
---
Honestly I really wanted the onyx one for a GoT reference, but I missed out on one unfortunately. I had 4 eggs last night, going to log on to grab my 5th, but I was looking at the list and noticed I was missing a paint splattered one. I was taking early finals that day and realized I studied the whole day instead of jumping on to grab an egg. 
---
What did my responsibilities have to be correct that day? ='/
---
Ghul: Glances at me
---
Game: You now have aids
---
More perks is fine if we get more perk points.
---
I am hoping for 1 extra point every 10-30 levels up to a max of 10 extra
---
I'm not in the "PVP crowd" but I don't think caps should be required. If you attack someone they have the right to annoy the hell out of you for as long as they want.
---
Whine, whine, whine. If you hate Bethesda Game Studios so much, why play their games? Why even comment here. Probably because you like to whine.  
---
Oh, and can you code a game, part of a game, anything?  
---
Did you want a refund? I don't.
---
I would love to play Fallout as a multi-player game.  And it'd be cool if there were collection boxes where you could drop off your stuff and those boxes would be linked together so you could drop your stuff off all over the map and not have to travel back to your base.  And, Bethesda, please give us guns and swords and all kinds of cool weapons so we can kill aggressive creatures in the world.  And also allow us to harvest flowers and plants like we can in Skyrim.
---
lol
---
Keyboard warriors who don't have the "balls" to step up and fight others on equal grounds.
---
I just want a teddy bear shelf.  Collect all of the teddy bears, plus wood, glass, and steel, and voila! teddy bear shelf.
---
The title seems like an Oxhorn video lmao
---
id still like to take a look, i have caps 
---
jimnvalerie on ps4
---
What if they attack you? That's my problem.  They attack me I kill them and now am stuck in a never ending loop of them taking revenge
---
A level 212 kept coming to my workshops while I was on my level 26 and would wait till I was in a defense event then contest it and one hit me preventing me from finishing the event
---
Same here, my boyfriend (who’s hella casual) just had his camp leveled by twat with an explosive sub machine gun for refusing trade. Fucking assholes
---
I'm with you, rebuilt my camp and would like to fill more stuff but at Max budget. It's only two rooms, isn't a massive base like a lot of people I see.
---
Anyone can get those plans easily now.
---
You can just buy them from the Free States vendor they recently put in the Whitesprings, and even before that, you could find them guaranteed at the Harper's Ferry Vendor for months now.
---
Sad thing is if I'm not on my merchant I have nothing worth trading lol
---
I mean yeah, if we could burrow, you know it would already be nerfed
---
It’s the worst😭 I use to see the mods like jet pack and calibrated shocks all the time but now I can never find them when I have the xo1 armour and want them.
---
Yes it does I have the mod learned along with ultra light and a few others
---
Oh I’ve just hopped on the game after about 3 months of now playing and I saw them and I though holy shit but thanks for that ahaha :)
---
It's a plan.
---
I did notice that, thought it was just bad rolls.
---
If you want to slowly build up something more reliable, consider The Couriers ( they have a FB group).
---
They move stuff around, deliver etc.
---
Members are trustworthy - but you have to look for yourself if you want to be convinced ;)
---
I fucking called it, here it goes, people whining about the stash limit again. Never enough for you people, you’re always just gimme gimme gimme.
---
Found one of these a couple nights ago, gave it to a buddy. It tears enemies up
---
yes, it exists. Are u on PS? I have a spare plan.
---
If make caps are a  requirement though,  it would apply to both attacking and being attacked.
---
I Love Lucy
---
I'm fine with that. I dont keep up a fight if I'm lossing like these people do and once they run out of caps it's just a waste of bullets for me
---
Usually if you hover over the pins, it’ll unlock a new location on your map if you haven’t been there already.  Also make sure to go to the top of all the fire towers and survey the area
---
I have full unyielding, adrenaline reaction, and radicool perk card, with full slugger. My bloodied super sledge does over 1000 damage at 20-30% health. It’s amazing. I kill a level 80 scorchbeast in like 2-3 hits.
---
Thx!
---
Neither did we haha, I told him all my good stuff was on my mule and that the camp wasn’t mine.
---
Found a Jetpack at Modus, was thrilled and bought ( of course) and yes....
---
It's nice to have, but MUCH more as a Gimmick or status thing then being a game changer.
---
That ist what Marsupial is for :)
---
Post needs Bondulance
---
My super sledge has gone up to 2k but my Bloodied swingspeed meat hook goes to 5k with full everything with phycobuff and wiskey
---
This turned out great! :)
---
Welp looks like i just did this
---
Yeah they are I had this exact same problem, I was losing my mind. Make sure you click left instead of right on the Deathclaw statue
---
Ah I didn't realize that, thank you.
---
Still having this issue on Xbox.
---
Lol this is not the camp your looking for.
---
Yeah right... No one. *Shifty eyes*
---
Thank you, and thanks with your help on the intro!
---
Lmao
---
I've been trying to find the calibrated shocks for months now. I've seen the jetpack once or twice in that time, and only after I had gotten the torso mod I really wanted. It's to the point now where I'm about to give up on the X-01 and put together a set of T-60 instead. The sad reality is that even if I did find the calibrated shocks, I wouldn't be able to install them anyway until Bethesda fixes the mod bug, and there's no telling when that'll be.
---
Rifleman perks work on gauss rifles.
---
Already confirmed patch 8.5
---
It shows the locations of other associated relay towers.  Select the pins to add the relays to your map.
---
The same type of maps are available in train stations for other stations, military sites for other military points or targets of interest and power plants for the associated power substations for that particular plant
---
Online gaming has the same concerns of every day life, the good, the bad, and the nasty.
---
Not familiar with console points, are there non - card methods for buying points?
---
Awesome! Thank you guys for helping :)
---
People have already data mined it and it seems we will just mark things in our inventory for sale
---
That's what I thought too but I went to the locations and couldn't find radio towers. I might have looked poorly though, this was last night at 2 AM.
---
True. Just dont see the fun in one hitting someone who has no chance to fight back lol
---
This has to be some of the coolest Fallout fan photos I've ever seen. Nicely done!
---
A misnamed plan. It's actually called Pocketed, not Deep Pocketed. Pocketed is a scrap mod so at least there's no ambiguity. If you find the plan called "Pocketed Marine Armor Chest" then it's the right one.
---
They don't buy wood or steel.  There are others too, but I've forgotten what always used to be left in my inventory when I was still automatically breaking everything down.
---
You build them. Floor decorations, same category as the deathclaw statue. Costs a few concrete to build i think.
---
Username checks out.
---
Did you select the pins?
---
I don't think I did.
---
If you want to satisfy your real life fallout kick, just search goodsprings in google maps and then look at reviews for fallout locations
---
I like when people down vote posts about a massive battle. It makes me wonder if I've killed those people before or if they're simply still trying to live in a Wasteland full of rainbows and unicorns. FYI: My avatar rides his unicorn into battle. His name is Uberhoof.
---
Do it.  Adds the location to your map if it's not already on it
---
i get the same thing, i have a TSE handmade, it's the only gun i carry, people always want me to trade for it
---
Whenever we have the "craft umpteen alcoholic beverages" challenges, I always head right over there (if I'm thinking of the same place on the western edge of the map just north of the soda factory), pick everything clean, take over the workshop, and then build a stash box so I don't have to creep all the way across the map to get home.
---
Can I have some
---
That’s totally okay with me mannn, though it will suck raiders gotta raid.
---
Cool thanks.
---
You're on timeout.
---
Which is why I have my house and extractors set so, you can't even get to my house without fast travelling or having a jetpack and cans of coffee. LOL
---
Lol they must not know about reddit
---
But did it come with a canvas bag or garbage bag?
---
*starts praying for pistol armor pen cards, preferably in perception. Or just add armor pen to the one pistol perk in perception.
---
Haha good luck getting those teddy bears I doubt that too. Maybe a magazine rack that actual works for your trouble but that’s streching out a bit
---
Yeah, it's hard to stand up straight when I'm done with them.
---
I've found mole rats that get "stuck" burrowing between one place and another, constantly going back and forth instead of attacking.  I just started standing at one of the holes and VATSing them as soon as they pop up again to kill them that way.
---
What?
---
U can't see them on the map
---
Xbox. Where did you find yours?
---
Or need the resources themselves. 
---
I've taken over workshops that were not (fully) used by their owner. I'm also stealing workshops when the owner decided to lock all resources because I hate people that don't want to share while they are killing mobs on the other side of the map.
---
Some people are just petty idiots.
---
Before survival mode was a thing, a guy came to my camp (i built a public rest stop, pretty obviously not a "private" place) and he stabbed me a few times. I told him i stashed all my junk and didnt care about the caps, and wasnt interested in pvp at the moment, so if he was gonna kill me to go ahead and do it.
---
Apparently he wanted to goad me into legit pvp and kill me without getting wanted, cuz he didnt like that. He proceeded to level mt whole base as i watched in amazement at the level of childishness he stooped to. It was like watching an infant break another kid's toy cuz they didnt want to play with him.
---
I "went afk" and just stood and watched. He would occasionally stab me again, then go back to wrecking shit. When he destroyed everything, he shot me and left.
---
I changed severs and repaired everything using my stockpiled junk. Took two seconds. Guy got wanted anyway cuz he destroyed my stuff, so. I have no idea what his logic was.
---
What
---
I think in some of the pre-release talk they mentioned that having a card system makes it easier for them to add new perks to the game in the future (compared to adding new perks to the fixed charts in Fallout 4 or Skyrim) so it could happen.
---
I'd like to buy marsupial serum, I'm on PC.
---
Misanthrope can teach you all sorts of things. Maybe you should stick to the urban dictionary, though.
---
I luv pills
---
You already drop
---
Lol what a baby
---
Yes all done now sorry :(
---
i would like to set up shops in a settlement where I can sell my shit load of excess pure water and adhesive in bulk
---
AH hell screw it get rid of the turret does it really help that much?
---
And not sure if it matters but try using more basic lights
---
That's what I love about this game. You can role play as a character from "Warriors" and have an absolutely awesome time while the rest of the server pines at their own agendas and holds hands while launching nuclear ordinance. It really is just like the release commercials. "Wouldn't it be nice?" *unabashed akimbo machine gun fire*
---
That’s our plan, rent a cabin near Seneca Rocks or so and spend four days exploring Monongahela and the area then moving on to Morgantown, visiting points down to Charleston and ending at the Greenbrier on the last night, planning on actually staying at the resort(ouch$)
---
Can i have a gander?
---
Or just do it like d3 did it and have the auction house be for all servers. Meaning you can buy from someone who is selling stuff on the AH from a different server.
---
Energy weapon kills turn targets into ash pile / green goo. Sometime this makes corpse entirely disappear. Sometimes it gets stuck in the worst place you could imagine. Scorchbeast kills are the worst, since you could end up with the invisible ash pile / goo stuck in midair.
---
And there's this rumor that gooified / disintegrated kills *permenantly* kill an enemy and prevent it from respawning in that server.
---
You can still blow yourself up with fireproof 3, but the odds of getting one shotted drop significantly.  Fireproof also helps against scorchbeast or grenade attacks.
---
Why is puking on people so gratifying? I don't understand it, but I sure love doing it. It makes people instantly seek revenge. Sometimes I go PG and simply hit them with a strange-smelling thumbs up.
---
I have 6. Def found one with a treasure map and I think one vendor has them.
---
It doesn't hit very hard and mostly you're just spamming bullets into its face while it's stunned. The fake sheepsquatch has the opposite problem where it hits hard, but goes down fast.
---
It's not easy balancing encounters in a game that allows so much damage and damage reduction stacking.
---
I once fast traveled to uranium fever and spawned in a locked animal cage in glassed caverns... So yeah, bugged is correct lol
---
He put next weekends date. I was confused as well. Lol
---
That depends on how they do it. If the AH is all the servers at the same time, then it would be far better than player vendors. This game has almost no immersion as it is, so that really isn't a very good reason to not have an AH.
---
The main issue with the AH would be the fact that most traders don't want caps as we are all maxed out on caps with the max you can have being only 25k per character.
---
Lol this happened to me last night. I run a shop and was afk eating at it when someone ran up trying to trade. I un-muted my mic and told him I appreciate the offer but unfortunately im not trading. He decided to whip out a bloodied LMG, luckily I’m a V.A.T.S. crit build so I 1 shot him. The nerve of some people
---
Bethesda should add more places to build stuff like interior cells  (bunkers, houses)
---
I'll see if I have one if not I can mod it for you I'm on x1 GT same as name here
---
“For the love of god” needs to go away, also. Really? You want a feature not for your gain but for the love of god? Okay lol. Seriously, do a search for this and limit it to just this sub.
---
No, it's awesome
---
I got over 10 mods 4 the x01 n I can't install a fucking thing 
---
I even deleted my power station n tryed it white springs still couldn't attach the mods 
---
Is any else having the problem????
---
Alright hombre. Reality check time. The queen doesn't have an "invincible" cycle to speak of. You clearly don't understand this fights mechanics.
---
Your build may not be bad, but your mechanics sure are.  Using both hammers and gattling plasma means 1 of 2 things. 1: you're splitting perks for them, which is a bad build for the queen, or 2: one of them has no perks, deals drastically inferior damage, and is a waste of time.
---
Unless you were fighting her alone, your plasma core didn't deal "5%" of her health, and you're just assuming you did all the damage the whole time you were blasting her, and that no one else was hurting her. If that's how it went down then the other 8 people combined should do that much damage without a bloodied build and basic perks. This is either delusions of grandeur, or you didn't tell this story very well.
---
One shotting a deathclaw is like bragging you punched the chess club president and he cried. My non-bloodied shotgun perked medic can one shot a deathclaw in the right circumstances. If you're one shotting mirelurk queens you're getting closer. There's also the fact that fist weapons are the most powerful, with a bloodied rad rage unyielding build. The hammers tell me you're probably using power armor. Power armor is crippling to your AP, limiting your power attacks. 
---
It's much more likely that a serious contributor or two gave up and left, DCed, or something else.
---
Either your build is bad, or your mechanics are bad. You straight up can't tell fact from fiction, and should learn to take other people's advice.
---
Also, the vertibots are useless against anything bigger than a super mutant. 
---
Screenshot and post your build here if you wanna prove me wrong.
---
Ohhh lol... I need to work on my reading comprehension
---
I hope so. My main reason I don't invest in my camp is cause it can get wrecked and too expensive to repair. I keep it simple for now
---
having the same issue with my x01
---
 LOL. I have a zero lock on my Fusion Generator, I have Scroched near by and its only prudent.
---
 Everything else is wide open. Take my Purified it generates pretty quick and sleep in my 4 poster. We all know each other, we were in the Vault together.
---
What kind of build are you using that you can't kill the scorch beasts fully leveled?
---
Thank god the negative perception glitch didn’t carry over from fo4. Radscorpions are already the devil. Compound that with the fact they could literally make a high level character useless when they sucked your perception permanently to -1 and holy hell I still just run from them.
---
Yep seen that loads, especially the last week or so, so for the love of all that is fallout please stop saying for the love of ....
---
Fear makes people do the strangest things.
---
It's only a mod, not a plan you can learn.
---
Also randomly being more squishy to major guts bullets
---
No ammo or aid items can be sold.
---
Or that. Total automatic atomic annihilation!
---
Learned from scrapping. Farming materials to make rifles, then scrap them, is the solution. It takes so freaking long. Get super duper 3 before you start and it'll save you a lot of time.
---
It has a very low chance to learn, so you might be at it for a while.
---
Yup, keeps flickering...
---
Yeah my merchant is a level 5 so I'd be screwed lol
---
Do you have 6 cobalt flux to exchange then i can do it
---
I didn't twist or assume anything. I asked you about the pedophile comment and you clarified. You're the one dealing in absolutes and putting extra meaning where there is none. That's your problem and not mine.
---
 You never denied the neck beard and homophobic stuff. Fighting bigotry with more bigotry gets no one anywhere anytime soon. And if you're even a little bit implying I'm a pedophile that's sorry as hell and shows what kind of hateful poison you are. You are very toxic and no better than the one you hate. 
---
It also shows you haven't seen the uglier side of our world if you think that crap doesn't happen anymore. You are fortunate. 
---
Also, people don't generally like talking about being molested. It's nothing good to remember. Unless you've had a similar experience I doubt you know what that's like or you wouldn't have even gone to that sorry place. 
---
Hating a bigot for being hateful is hypocrisy. If you don't like his perceived hate why would you put more in the world. There are other ways without doing what you claim to hate.
---
The thing is if he does feel that way he isn't on his channel spouting hateful rhetoric like you're doing here. If he's actively supporting hate groups I could understand. But attacking him and his channel for personal beliefs that are no one's business but his is ridiculous. 
---
I'm sure youre already working toward "you're a hateful person like him too!" But I'm not. I separate his past views from his stuff now. I've watched his channel for a few years at least and I never had any idea he was religious or held those horrible views at any point. Horrible but personal beliefs.
---
Someone's opinion about who others sleep with is just that an opinion and not based on fact.
---
The videos I saw weren't just critical they were hateful and full of name calling. How is anyone supposed to take that seriously?
---
I have over 760 hours in and only yesterday started seeing an influx in people being real dicks
---
This 100 pct
---
I have a ultra light chest and limbs deep pockets combat chest but no plan for marine chest
---
You might be able to buy it from a vendor
---
Always thought it would of been cool to have a personal room in vault 76 as a interior cell
---
I had to google up a video to figure it out this morning. It just works!
---
That would be terrifying
---
You can also find them in the train station there. Two bites hanging off the bottom of the poster board start the quests. They are super fun and some of the best quests in Wild Appalachia so far!
---
Thanks, both of you! My boyfriend uses shotguns a lot and I don't think he has it, so I'll keep an eye out.
---
Just get rid of it for scorched beats and the queen. Everything else is fine. Also there are lots of us that enjoy gooifying things :)
---
I see at least 2 or 3 every time I run it! And I sure as shit end up shooting at them! Lol. I put on pa myself tho. Seems like I’m the permanent conduit!!!
---
Vault raids would be cool too
---
GG, you will make a nice cap farm for one shot builds
---
I did this quest yesterday, stand by the ritual thing and look at it and scoot should come soon. If not try making noise, it may just be bugged for you but I finished that quest yesterday and he came out fine lol
---
This topic is a fucking mess lmaoooooo
---
How many caps?
---
No sadness bro, it’s all love. Send nukes ❤️
---
Up to you. Id do 10 apiece
---
Yeah i know it's not easy but i don't really have an amazing build, or armor or weapons but literally anything than the sheepsquatch is a piece of cake and i'm playing solo. When i launched my first nuke i went in that silo armed to the teath with 50 stim packs and chems and all that. I think i maybe used one stim pack.
---
Yeah stuff like that happens all the time
---
Lovestopuck, team up?
---
You can get plans and mods that are considered rare from treasure maps, and some hard to find out in the wild type weapons like handmades and stuff like that.
---
They can make caps off me even when I don't have any?  That's an interesting method of infinite cap generation.
---
What are you on about?
---
Agreed. Loot should be tiered:
---
Tier 1: Legendary Weapon/Armour (minimum 2 star); Rare Recipe; Valuable Junk; Caps (100-300)
---
Tier 2: Legendary Weapon/Armour; Valuable Junk (ballistic fibre and such); Caps (50-100); Aid Item
---
Tier 3: Caps(20-50); Aid Item; Regular Weapon/Armour; Regular Recipe
---
Bosses, such as SBQ should drop from all 3 tiers.
---
Legendary enemies should drop from Tier 2 and Tier 3.
---
Crowned enemies only drop from Tier 3.
---
I did that. I reread the notes and I mini nuked the altar lol. The dagger was never on the altar either:
---
Nowhere, it's all RNG.
---
I’ll be on in about 2 hours. I’ll send you a message when I get on.
---
One if the advantages shotguns have is that there aren't a lot of strength perks that benefit them, so you can actually take all nine ranks of shotgunner instead of the usual three. This couples well with shotguns' already high base damage.
---
I'm actually super excited to start my shotguns character, because it seems like a fun alternative to the boring rifle and melee builds.
---
Typical keyboard warrior mentality, until some one hands them their ass, then they ask for a rematch or run away crying!
---
Exploring around. I'm sure if i ran to the end it could be finished inside 5 minutes
---
I've been looking for ages. I'm trying Biv and workshops but so far no luck
---
I play every day on PC playing now in fact servers are full off people from L1 to L300+
---
Awesome, thank you for doing this and sharing it with fellow fans!
---
Game needs a final boss
---
The one that caused a massive backslash across various websites for the shit bag and shit helmet?
---
Nah I'm good haha.
---
I have a problem with people starting pvp with me. Me killing them then they keep seeking revenge until I get annoyed enough to hop servers
---
From last night it was instantly respawning in the watoga station as well. My buddy bought it and it immediately reappeared.
---
You should try to use your camp to recreate your cabin. Great photos!
---
Hmm, idk then, I had to like look around the room for a little and then he came out of literally no where like spawned in, so that’s kinda weird. Sorry man!
---
I never sell bobbleheads.  I noticed a few missing the other day.  Thought i was.imagining things.
---
I can see from your comment history you're not the nicest person. You seem to live for telling people how stupid they are.
---
I keep getting same plans like T-60 motion assist servos other and over. Done well over 200 maps. Just curious because I see same people buying bulk maps all the time for around 40 Caps apiece.
---
But the coolest would be a Legendary Vendor!
---
Sounds like fake news
---
I use pretty basic lights, I could get rid of some though since some corners are pretty bright at night. But the turret doesn’t really do anything. It’s more decorative sitting in my barn-garage type building
---
It definitely would make loot drops more consistent
---
I did the same, easy!
---
And I was sure glad I've been saving gum drops since that was a daily awhile back, got that one done easy too.
---
Don't worry, they're getting ready to sell it to you as a microtransaction soon enough.
---
Yup, got mine for £13 from amazon in the UK. Only reason I bought it.
---
got hunter's long coat the other day and the clean/shiny spacesuit for friend
---
I got The Dragon from a treasure map, I was pretty happy with that find.
---
This is amazing
---
I thought the same thing. Really wish the devs would give us a cabin building set
---
No one knows any of these people
---
Sounds like me I’m a major ammo hoarder
---
I have a 3* lv45 gauss rifle. I hope I can reroll the buffs though
---
 But I love useing the plasma easy ammo to make and you get allot
---
It's nice to see new people buy the game. How do you enjoy it so far? By the way, the atom store was filled mostly with crap since launch. Doubt we'll ever see good stuff in there.
---
On my mule I had 20k caps 30 of each tse 6000 nuka grape and other stuff but after the weight cap update I had only 3 of each tse and 2000 nuka grape so I think they stopped banning players and just take away the duped items. That's just a theory tho
---
Bethesda approved? No. As far as I know, no mods are approved.
---
There is a [mod that makes meat piles glow](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/144), and while I cannot say they approve or disapprove, I suspect something that lets you find your kills would not result in a ban without warning, as it offers no real advantage against other players. Keep in mind, however, I have no authority, I just surmise as much.
---
Yes it does, I have lots of price daily making my 5mm ammo for nuked zone
---
Ah Thanks. I couldn't think of anywhere apart from Deathclaws that had eggs.
---
doesnt armor effects not work inside PA?
---
In several circles both are feared or avoided. Welcome to the club
---
I actually think the magazine racks will be a sure thing, but that's about it. Bobblehead stand, magazines, and *maybe* teddy bears.  think it'll work like the fermenter does with the stash and you'll just be opening a stash that lets you select what to "equip."
---
Some areas give different plans, I've found cranberry bog gives me the motion assist servos most of the time, but I haven't tried out the other areas yet.
---
The guy that was banned was doing some dubious stuff. Also moving ammo back and forth between multiple characters. They didn't ban him for time played in game.
---
Get over yourself. What platform are they?
---
Any energy weapon shouldn't be your preferred weapon vs a SB anyway.
---
I run a TSE Gatling Laser for anything else but them.
---
No ty
---
So you aren't just "kind of a dick", you are actually a douche canoe coated in the grease of a thousand unwashed neckbeards
---
I would actually laugh my ass off if I saw that, that's trolling on the next level :P
---
And then I'd report him!
---
This is literally you idiot. You’re so pompous. And scamming people on the market is really low
---
I don't have that much stuff on my mule really. Nothing was a double that disappeared. Just single items I've picked up along the way. Obviously the weapons and armor that disappeared were not really any good just random 3* items I was saving. What caught my attention was a backwoodsman 9 that someone wanted. I only had one. So why would they remove it. It's obviously not duped
---
Wowza..... TIL.
---
Good thing I don’t run energy weapons.
---
like 700 hours i never even picked up a mini gun what the hell is wrong with me
---
I had a guy just like you take over Hemlock Holes for the same reason. He thought I was some pushover that could have been beaten with Lvl 1 turrets when I spawned in. I killed him about 4 times before he gave up. Heavy weapons+ explosives ftw.
---
Quit looking for it and then you'll find it lol. I stopped looking and gave up on trying to find one. Now I have one but don't have an X01 to put it on now. Went with the T60 instead since shocks and jetpack was easier. 
---
Now I'm just hoarding this X01 mod for the highest bidder.
---
RadToads should have eggs aswell
---
So unsure if the eggs in Helvetia are still there, but someone should probably check ;)
---
Well man. Come pvp and kick my ass to put me in my place. Surely that's no problem right? (Pc)
---
Or a personal faction themed room/home. I want to live in a Free States bunker.
---
Im sorry wut. You can pacify the queen?? Thats ridiculous lol
---
They've already discussed making a way for your camp to appear for everyone on the map, specifically for vending (although it may not be directly tied to the vending machine itself, but another object instead). Eliminates the absolute need of a player hub (still would be fun, but would a lot more effort than public camps), stops people from placing and cluttering their camps in high traffic areas that would prevent others from selling items on a far too regular basis, and also makes it so your camp could be in the middle of nowhere yet still viable to sell items as everyone can see where it is. It would also be nice to be able to fast travel to these public camps (would be horribly annoying if you couldn't), but for balancing purposes, they should still cost caps to travel too, as they're not teammates camps.
---
There's the fallout 76 market Reddit sub. I've got some good things there
---
Actually this is a really good idea
---
To be fair, it's low odds to get any specific prefix/weapon combo. You might just be having no luck.
---
If you ever get a decent one I recommend it. They are ammo bigs, but a lot of fun to use.
---
My wife and I did the same thing in DC about a year after we played fallout 3. It's fun to recognize those weird details and designs then go back to find them in the game when you get home.
---
Anyone know if signs &amp; letters plan along with BOS plans, power armor paints can be found when doing maps?
---
Well, start at the beginning: What did you enjoy about other Fallout games?
---
YAYYYY ANTI ARMOR ROLLING PIN AFTER USING ALL MY STIMPAKS MEDX USING MY NERD RAGE PSYCHOBUFF
---
Limb damage seems to be separate to normal HP. You can see in the pip-boy that each limb has its own bar. If you hit an enemy, it deals both normal damage and limb damage, and the +50% legendary only applies to the limb damage part.
---
The cripple perks (Enforcer, Tormentor etc) roll randomly on each hit. On a success, they multiply limb damage dealt by 9999.
---
Actually, I had a friend talking about this just last night.
---
Dont know if this is a missed connection or something, but the person had yoinked their SBQ fluxes off their body at the fight.
---
They tried to trade back for it, even dropping a bunch of lead in exchange, before resorting to leveling the camp.
---
Unknown if this was the same situation, but sometimes, people have decent reasoning. (Whitesprings turret farms, etc.)
---
Ok
---
Dang, you're lucky. My wife's boyfriend won't even let me play the Nintendo switch.
---
Ammo ain’t a problem for him though remember
---
This would be pretty cool
---
BOS plans yes. That’s where I found mine. In the cranberry bog
---
You're missing the point where the game was a financial success, despite its buggy launch.
---
I doubt the CEO's will care much, but the devs really do. You can easily conclude that from some of the updates on the road map they give us.
---
I fully appreciate this.
---
I got my pocketed arms from the SBQ battle
---
👆he’s right. All u can do is farm heavy leageadary spots like white spring and westek. Wataga used be good too till the legendary bots just disappeared.
---
Let the player shit into the burrows with such vigour we have a chance of gassing the fucker.
---
Give me 5 minutes and I’ll help you.
---
Yep. Used to use my gatling plasma on scorchbeasts until I realized they would disintegrate midair and I couldn't loot them.
---
Another dumb thing that Bethesda hasn't patched.
---
Sorry, "Reroll the buffs"?
---
Okay you pompous jackass, it wouldn’t be problem except we play on different platforms. 
---
This problem even adds to the point of your arrogance. Thinking you come close to qualifying as a main boss. You’re probably just another trash handmade stealthboy player. You’re not original at all
---
Nah was happening month or so ago for me
---
Such a awesome thing your doing, will you be on today by chance? I have 2 characters i would like to get a few serums for. I have all the mats needed and will gladly share anything i have you may need. Thank you for your kindness.   friend request sent
---
Wow I never thought of it like that. That would actually be a really awesome addition. Maybe somewhere in Morgantown or Flatwoods so all players can easily get to it.
---
You won't be able to set the sound of you taking a glorious explosive shit as the effect when someone activates your machine.
---
You cannot have the machine linked to a trap which drops a massive SBQ turd on players who do not buy an item.
---
dope Dope DOPE!
---
So strange that I only get ballistic or melee off whitesprings or uranium fever. I thought I saw a post a while back that those enemies don't drop energy weapons very often, while others do.
---
Against standard scorchbeasts why not? They still go down so easy, and you literally get gifted plasma cores from enemies at times.
---
Turrent farms in whitesprings are like the one exception for me but if you have flux in a nuke zone and loss it it's fair game once the events over. Me personally I wont pick anything up but junks about the only thing we loss on death so I dont expect to get back anything I drop if I die
---
It's because PS makes you put money on your account in specific chunks, and you can't just buy directly buy the Atoms. You need to give Sony your money first for some reason, and they dictate the amount.
---
Are they bloodied? Because I learned today the bloodied effect only shows when you equip it.
---
Agreed. I also think the mezzanine level at top of the world would be a great trading hub.
---
Well, they've made using Gatling Plasma's even more annoying since the last patch anyway
---
The damage in your pip boy is the base damage, and if it has any legendary modifiers it will adjust after you equip it. For example, my nocturnal explosive gatling plasma sits at like 59 or something without perks. If it is night time, it will jump up to around 78, but go down to 39 or so if it's day. I believe damage perks should automatically show up in the pip boy, but if you have a stacking effect like adrenaline or adrenal reaction I think that will update once you equip it too
---
I am afraid it would be a very big problem for you to kill me. I will let others comment and testify to this
---
You’re most likely; entirely trash
---
Now that you mention it,  it does seem like it's mostly my bloodied weapons that do it.
---
I have a two shot rapid gatling gun, but the problem is the gatling gun is ammo efficient. I had like 15000 last week, still at 12500 after using it extensively. Best of luck getting rid of it
---
Ah ok.  That makes sense
---
You mad bro?
---
Dah f***
---
You can find rare plans like deep pocketed armor, heavy/sturdy armor, power armor crafting stuff, power armor mods, etc.
---
Not just Bloodied but anything that effects damage sometimes won't calculate until it's equipped.
---
Clever. You should change your post to “I think I should be the main boss” and see how people respond to your lack of sense.
---
I acquired a 10mm legendary SMG and with weapon-smith level 5, it gave me the option to craft the prime receiver with normal crafting mats and I believe two types of nuked material.
---
I'll make exceptions depending on the base.  I just stopped at one with a locked junk extractor, but they had everything else wide open and available for use.  They even had a radiation arch and purified water available.  I left it alone.
---
You incel bro?
---
Ok I’ve only seen it with bloodied
---
You insecure bro? Fallout all you got? I’m sorry you’re not as good as you think you are
---
Well threatening to take hard earned resources that's on lockdown and destroy said objects is similar to a child on a temper tantrum.
---
I finally worked now. I had to server hop a few times. It only worked once the dagger showed up on the little altar
---
I just have a lvl 57 melee build.
---
Incel?
---
These are great!  I am amazed at how close to the real scenery bethesda made it. Thanks for sharing!!
---
deathclaw statue in the menus
---
Wouldn't it be cool if mutations had visual changes to your character? Like how they announced it at E3?
---
Jump servers until you get monsters closer to your level.
---
Yeah right that isnt real there's no way your not encumbered after that much steel.
---
Nice job reaching out to use your resources in a team format!
---
Now, in the future, try a map recon before you get to your destination to see if there any high level characters in tha AO.  They tend to Jack up the.monster level, and.it works both ways.
---
Also, I just finished that quest line at level 30 as a solo.  Felt.lilenit.could be done a bit earlier, but I'm surprised you tried it at level 10.  Beth games are designed to leave to MQ for a bit of leveling then coming back..stronger..leaner..tougher.. a lean mean fighting machine!!!
---
Bruh, just looked at your history, you don’t even have a sent assassin set and you’re saying someone can’t kill you in pvp?
---
Get a grip lol.
---
Yes. I almost did it too by accident cuz the button to reload (on xbox) is the same as to pacify
---
Accidentally drink dirty water and gets parasits....
---
It wasnt financially successful considering the next titles they launch will be met with such scrutiny they will never live it down. 
---
Many fans wont preorder a bethesda title, buy their shoddy falsely advertised products or believe their promises at face value ever again. 
---
So it depends what you measure success by. 
---
Because for them to be truly successful they would need to stop lying to our faces and acting like we should praise anything they give us. Todd your company is going into the shitter...
---
I think they said new perks are being added with the prestige system.
---
I'd be happy to take it off your hands. Ign is Purplentaclez
---
Or someone trying to survive in the wasteland and others have gotten in the way of that.
---
By the way, this is a game.  Your personal insult from a couple posts back shows a lot less decorum than anything I've done so far.
---
Technically (sadly only with the camp items), you can view the camp items in the atomic shop if you select them while editing the camp. It will let you look at the 3d model of them, and ask you to buy them if you wanna place them
---
Come at me bro
---
That would be good, but now after playing it I feel like these "visible" changes are when you explode or give off sparks and different auras ect...  
---
So not what people were expecting
---
Also not on PC, but you couldn’t damage me if you tried bud
---
Yes please
---
Aaaaah cheers dude
---
Why not....Deathclaw Ants?
---
I still want weapon renaming tho
---
Full stagger perks for tse combat shotgun. After 8 hits you stagger and thats its.
---
You think you’re gonna hit me 8 times before I hit you two times? Lol
---
I personally use a mixture of TSE 50 Cal and BE Gatling, just because that's what I have available. 
---
Prime receivers would theoretically be better but then they aren't useful for everyday life and the bullet upkeep is a drag.
---
You naturally earn stuff in game very easily the fact you would stoop so low to grief others resources instead of properly asking for a 'quick' drop of needed X resources. Realize other people can make the choice of saying no and accept it otherwise don't be surprised of being disliked.
---
You assumed i am not full sentinel with anti stagger perks
---
This is because some enemies seems to be buffed with a disease aura. I'm getting infected without getting hit, just have to be close enough.
---
Where's the link to the "proof"? That's right, do don't have either.
---
Well considering you were looking to buy a set and no one respondedddddd
---
There are no “anti-stagger” perks. 
---
Adamantium skeleton does not protect against stagger 
---
Even if there were anti-stagger perks, then that would mean you assumed I don’t have them as well 😂
---
I wholeheartedly agree.
---
I really think the Bone Raider Excavator Power Armor was perfect!  The jaded appearance with the bones was just so good.  I hope they do the same thing with the other suits of Power Armor, like T-51b.
---
As for actual clothes, they should bring back stuff from the past games.  The Raider Painspike Armor and Merc Troublemaker outfit were pretty cool.
---
They’re probably hoping you aren’t on reddit or a FB group,
---
I just got a 3* bloodied Tesla Rifle for 900 caps.
---
I requested it, he put the price, I snapped it up.
---
Can’t hurt to try 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Wow that's so amazing.
---
I have been wondering what was real or computer-generated
---
Or they do, and they’re hoping he doesn’t lol
---
Yeah I get your disclaimer. No worries. 👍
---
Guess but maybe act like an adult if they refuse lol
---
How to do remove rads?
---
 Do the Events, The Robot one is easy. Kill any Legendary enemy's and you'll be done in no time.
---
 Scorchbeasts require some preparation to fight well. Their screaming attack is Explosive, does nothing to me as I have Armor that ignores Explosions. A gun to bring em' down, or at least keep them around is needed, I use a Lever Action myself and hip fire it at her horribleness. ;) I finish them with a Combat Knife but that is a bit specialized for low levels. ;)
---
bloodied or anti-armor, two-shot if you got nothing better. explosive is the go-to secondary but there are more specific ones depending on your build. this is true for anything, not just the queen.
---
.50 cal is the overall best heavy. gatling has higher single-shot damage but fires a lot slower, people like it for the ammo consumption. the new and improved LMG has the highest DPS for long battles such as the queen, but crafting .308 is still hell. minigun is meh and energy ones are still bad. a flechette harpoon + one gun army might be good for crippling her.
---
Come kick my ass then
---
So are wendigo's and snallygasters.
---
Well, "real" in as much as they're based on real-life folklore.
---
i cant wait to see these base destruction attempts when beth makes camps indestructible...
---
That would be interesting for sure!  I would how that would look in practicality?  What kind of builds it would generate?
---
Bramin takes up hella space.
---
As far as I can tell there's no reason not to use the silencer on everything you can put it on.  You can unload on someone right in front of you and get constant sneak attacks.
---
What was it
---
And then what? Have a tamed Scorchbeast Queen circling above your camp? That's crazy.
---
That would be cool!
---
Yeah. The event should not give the same thing over and over
---
The sub machine pistols would rule for sure!
---
I’m crossing my fingers
---
2.5 caps round it up to 3 if you want due to the fact of 25% water levels goes up but doesn't heal you.
---
Yea they don’t drop often. I got like 400 + hrs and I’ve gotten a hand full , nothing good either. It’s funny u posted this too cuz I actual got an AA Gatling laser this morning at westek.
---
You can get rare plans and a whole lot of gear.
---
It's a bug related to the last update, effectively all of us have it now. You'll just have to wait for it to be fixed.
---
*Sits on Calibrated X-01 mod and waiting for Reactive Plates*
---
That would be perfect timing
---
Ya, I don't take many photos because of the annoying menus. Definitely pumped for it. Hopefully we can store more than 50 as well.
---
Which system. No a lot to go on here.
---
There is something currently wrong with mods, they won't attach and stay... it's been like this since the last patch
---
Oh sorry 
---
All mod kits on all weapons, armour and power armour are currently broken.
---
I pre ordered too the helmet edition. I have easily got 200-250hrs playtime already and plan to spend a lot more in game too, I can safely say I have got more than my money's worth already.
---
Yes, definitely. I like to stock pile then hit em all at once. Kind of expensive cap wise unless you walk but yeah, tons of plans yesterday including Marine armor
---
Maybe he got a crash to desktop like me lol but good on you for helpin him out!
---
just did!
---
Rule 6 is?
---
The Wolf Pack Horde event in the forest is another good one. Very low levels, guaranteed 3 Iirc.
---
Ah, shame I went offline an hour ago. The server I was on was dropping back to back nukes. Might be worth server hopping a bit.
---
Okay cool. I’ll probably go looking for them. Thank you!
---
Okay cool thank you
---
Seconded
---
I think they are targeting females. What guy wants an Easter bonnet? Just one of the many negative aspects of this game.
---
There was a seeded drop theory about a week ago.  Basically seems rng gives you items similar to what you have stashed and in your inventory.  It seems to me it might be true. Just try to get your hands on some laser guns and stash them. Then hit your farming area.
---
I use lever guns mostly and seem to find a lot of them when I farm. Worth a try!
---
Mine has been doing it on and off for awhile. Some patches seem to reduce it, others increase it. Incredibly spotty, haven't put any effort into figuring out why (probably out my hands anyways)
---
r/fo76filthycasuals
---
Radstag and wolf comes with the sheepsquatch quest end, Thomsan farm doesn't provide any head.
---
Thanks for the info folks.  Much appreciated.
---
How do you know it was a TSE? 😂 Hardly anyone runs those anyway, also.
---
Yup, every once in a while the game freezes when quitting to desktop.
---
Seeing an irradiated mole rat pop out of a mirror is the stuff of nightmares
---
Can you link that for me? I can’t find Fo76 online for $10, and i wanna buy it for my friend
---
It's an actual bug, I hope they fix it soon
---
One of the best sources for caps are golf outfits and golf skirts.  Worth 27 caps each with hard bargain 3 and a grape mentat.  Along with farming ghouls at Whitespring Golf Club you’ve got to grab some of those.
---
Our conversation has concluded because of your previous insult.  Have a happy easter.
---
Old habits lol all I know is it was explosive
---
Couldn’t tame it since it’s not a random spawn enemy
---
Don’t have any pets sadly
---
Vampires gattling laser would disagree with you. Pretty much unkillable.
---
Would love the link also!
---
Ya, I found the neon letters twice with maps. Lots of small letter plans too.
---
Oh, definitely lol
---
Eh.. In most cases in my experience it's a wasted perk. Most encounters end in split seconds. For me, I'm a ranged VATS Crit user but even up close with my AAE Handmade most enemies are only a few shots.
---
Shooting limbs in PVP is too cumbersome, and expecting that from a melee user.. I'd rather just keep Blocker 3.
---
Assassins, Blocker, Fireproof are primarily a key. Assassins Sentinels is nuts. But otherwise though, if you're going to get crippled by a melee user there is generally no point in trying to kite. You can't backstep fast enough, plus they get a leap if they VATS primary attack.
---
As it stands now, I'd say limb damage is basically moot in PVP.
---
Even when I was running melee in PVP.. Limb damage was never a focus. Raw DPS output will always be better. Bloodied or not. Limb is just too.. Situational. Especially when better perk options and point allocations are more beneficial overall.
---
Just my two cents.
---
As someone who is not easily offended I would love this. :)
---
They did delete duped items a couple of months ago.
---
I see.. I thought my system was at fault. Thanks!
---
I rather have a dog/cat over a bramin imo I would give up turrets for those.
---
That might be a great idea. It's a shame  the questline with rose ruins it though. As it's supposed to be sealed up. But we do need another player hub.
---
There is a fifth you pick up from the ranger HQ, north of Watoga. In the room with beaver cages. It's called 'Sinking Feeling'
---
I'm pretty sure that was sarcasm.
---
Yep this.  Some idiots don’t want to trade but want to check out your armor and weapons to see if it’s an easy gank.  Or see if you have a lot of junk on your to make it a profitable gank.
---
Not an edit, glitch/bug. I had no steel scrap in inventory, came from the two mods on the right side. 
---
I was not able to use it for crafting.
---
When the legendary vendor comes out, the buffs aren’t great I can’t remember what they are, I’m banned from posting on fo76 or I’d post a picture when I get home (I got into the train station and posted pictures)
---
I agree with you, except for the teddy bears I just don’t see them caring to make a self for them. I’m just tired of the assumption from so many people that they can place down their scraps of gold anywhere or their package of cigarettes with their empty bottles of booze. Not going to happen. Not going to be able to place your gun up against your bed or on your nightstand. It’s going to be on a rack on the wall and when you add it, like the fermenting station, I’ll bet money that it won’t proper center some guns like FO4 did and drive my OCD up a wall.
---
Spoiler alert there may be a dungeon underneath it
---
I have one turret which doesn’t even do anything since it’s a centerpiece in my industrial garage
---
They can't patch shit I tell ya. Lol
---
Cant find it under floor deco
---
What is that?
---
You can with camp items, or at least some. Not sure if it works with all, maybe just skins? Anyway go to build mode and even though you can’t build it, you can turn it, move it around etc like you’re about to build it. Gives you a good idea.
---
That said I still like your idea, or at least one where we get to see clothing and weapon skins on our characters. Someone said changing room style would be a good idea and I agree. At least.
---
So what is the overloaded steel origin? You saying it can't be used? Is this a visual bug?
---
Or syringers. I may as well fight normal enemies.
---
Lemonade vendor
---
I think some of it stems from how people say the date. In good ol' Blighty, where in between drinking tea and eating black pudding we speak the Queen's English, we would say "Today is the 21st of April," hence why we format written dates as 21/04/2019. 
---
It's all moot anyway, as anyone with an inkling of sense knows the only truly correct date format is ISO 8601 🧐
---
You want a set of unyielding cavalier for melee.
---
Don’t let someone sell you on sentinel.
---
When you’re melee you’re sprinting toward enemies while they’re shooting at you,
---
Happy hunting!
---
Waiting for them to pop here as well, hadn't considered it as an addition. Genius!
---
Or the classic “IT’LL BE IN THE ATOM STORE AND COST 2000 ATOMS HURR DURR”.
---
Yeah this is gonna be the best Beyond Good andEvil game yet.
---
yeah the most serious 'normal' female clothing i founds so far is the miner cloth
---
A location that’s not often used would be great. If they just added a door to a new cell like nukashine quests and you go into the shop I would love it. I think a great place would be like Valley galleria, it’s already a shopping mall, just add a new exterior door to the Atomic Shop, walk around and spend your Atoms right there.
---
Link below when they gave fallout 76 for free with any purchase of controller.
---
[https://gamerant.com/fallout-76-free-with-ps4-controller-purchase-at-gamestop-germany/](https://gamerant.com/fallout-76-free-with-ps4-controller-purchase-at-gamestop-germany/) 
---
This occurred in 3-4 months after release and its never a good sign and if you want to check when this went on sale during December look on Trueachievements site as its posts every sale that occurs.
---
This was was asking to get trolled lol. But yeah it’s irritating. Expected though, not everyone as read the roadmap.
---
I like it though. It’s pretty satisfying tbh
---
Try missile turrets it obliterates invader pve. 2ndly I think your budget lvl scales. 3rdly food upper floors cost a lot also.
---
You should post this on the trading subs, it'll be way more popular there.
---
That'd be awesome! Mycology is interesting I  the first place, then imagine what a Morel would be like in the Wasteland! It's also the only mushroom that actually tastes good to me...
---
You do realize this is a game where the characters are in a wasteland competing for resources, correct?
---
* Only allows you to sell Civil War Era Top Hats and Marine Tactical Helmets
---
I ignore them and they suicide on my mutations. The tiny shits pushing me around in power armor is annoying and weird, though.
---
I remember leaving the vault and traveling to some little farm then having no idea what to do next except repeating the same even over and over lol
---
Really great idea, two thumbs up
---
One of my best friends from college is going to law school in West Virginia and his grandparents were from Sutton. He claims that FO76 Sutton looks better than the real one and I figured I would get confirmation from others
---
If you can earn stuff easily in the game, why not leave the extractors unlocked and share?  And as for asking, that generally doesn't work because people are more likely going to shoot first and ask questions later.
---
Do you know where the deathclaw statue is? Pretty sure you go to that one and move to the left.
---
To be fair, they are a MAJOR annoyance but just a very minor danger. They add little to the game other than increasing the grind.
---
He got plans?
---
I agree. Running out of stash space too. All these new named legendaries and such. Increase camp budget and stash size!!
---
Yeah i found out about 2 others besides the 4 the day after i posted this
---
YES !  Been struggling with this crap for weeks now. Second floor as well. Looks like it will take a while until they fix it.
---
Yeah, and Chad does her nails after they're done so her husband falls for it, right?
---
Scorchbeast attacks are worse. At least one person has to have had an epilepsy attack.
---
Usually using that logic people would be more hostile 0 restrictions needed looting stash boxes. That's the kind of world your talking about.
---
It's always fun hanging around the wasteland in :) . I have two characters, my main is level 25 and my new second char is nearing 10. Feel free to add me- XPixieSoulX
---
If you read what I actually posted, you'd realize that I broke two of my hammers on her face. If she doesn't have an unreasonable amount of health, or doesn't have an invincibility phase, I really can't understand how she didn't die to two of my most powerful weapons.
---
I carried the gattling plasma strictly for backup, and highly doubted that I needed to use it, but when my hammers broke it was my last resort. I have a full bloodied build. I've told you.
---
The only perk that is in a traditional build and not in mine is blocker, because I dont feel like I need more defense with both Lone Wanderer and Nerd Rage. I have Incisor at max, and luck perks to boost my damage, and I've obviously picked up the two handed perks. 
---
You're right though, I dont have any perks for my gattling plasma, because I thought that it was highly unlikely that I was going to have to use it.
---
If one plasma core didn't do a solid 5% of the damage, and my hammers weren't able to kill her, that's proof enough that she has too much health. There should be no reasonable way that I can break two sledgehammers with over 300 damage over her head without her dying, and still have to fire about 10 or so of my plasma cores into her face.
---
Additionally, that's why you should be able to equip the final vertibots (if they were added) with donated weapons. Endangerol would be extremely helpful in the fight, and while you can do it yourself, it's a hassle. You could also equip them with legendary weapons that dont fit your build. 
---
But God, what I would give to hear Modus angrily taunting the scorchbeasts from a vertibot. The battle wasn't the most boring because of the gunplay, it was boring because there was no interaction. Yes, other players came along, but they brought penalties and a few of them spent their time emoting instead of fighting.
---
In conclusion, either the queen does have an invincibility phase, or there's an underlying problem with the health, both which could honestly be countered with more damage, which we don't currently have. It really doesn't matter if they only output 20 dps if there are 10 of them which constantly attack the SBQ. That's 200 dps, almost as good as a half decent build.
---
A rad giraffe would be cool, to be honest.
---
A giraffe, if you will.
---
T51 has the highest ballistic resistance and 2nd highest energy. It suffers in the rad resist department. 
---
If your worried about rads use x01 otherwise t51 is the best

The balance of strength in creatures is severely lacking. Scorchbeast might stagger me but their attacks don’t push me around. Mole rats will push me around like crazy even in power armor, especially if there’s more than one. Cure or suppress your mutations and turn on the auto atom perk and they’ll push you from one side of the map to the other.
---
Considering my rads are high and I don’t want to die from that, obviously as well as from damage itself, proto x01 then?
---
PVP servers on PS4 are full for me.
---
Why buy it? Dogfood can be found almost everywhere.
---
The Diablo 3 mail system and shared stash between characters works really well. I would love if F76 did something similar.
---
Awesome! Back at the beginning of March, I went to Ohio with my mom and my best friend. I asked her if we could stop somewhere that is on the state line of Ohio and west Virginia. This place is point pleasant. We waited a whole week to see this beautiful town. I ended up looking at the mothman museum, and even got a hoodie and a bracelet. Any time I leave the house, hot or cold, I wear my hoodie. I haven't even taken my bracelet off.
---
Then the Vertibots could be buffed. Most vertibots are level 20, why not make level 50 or higher Vertibots for the most important event in the game? I also suggested that you could equip the vertibots with other weapons. This would be great for equipping them with Endangerol syringers or unused legendary weapons.
---
You mean you bought one? TS energy weapons don't exist anymore.
---
Because I want to

They aren't on xbox...  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/beoy33/new\_survival\_challenge\_rewards\_and\_more\_april\_18/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/beoy33/new_survival_challenge_rewards_and_more_april_18/)
---
Why don't you sell it on a trading sub? 😂
---
I have a spare if you want to buy it.
---
Glowing super scorched radioactive weathered rat ant dogs.
---
That's strange then because I was able to break 2 of my hammers on her face with a bloodied build. I thought there was invincibility because there were times where her health bar didn't even change while I was either shooting at her or beating her with her hammer.
---
What if the junk pile has the needed screws/springs they needed in that pile. The lock button was made for a reason. If your playing survival sure there's others who do the shoot 1st thing but in adventure mode people are more looser. If stealing is your thing well that's disappointing.
---
I'm actually planning on doing that today. I've got something like 15'ish maps and after I finish some house work, I'm going treasure hunting!
---
Or you could marry someone who respects you.
---
In on PC and all the vendors in my game have 0 caps. It’s been this way for three days
---
[Here's a write-up someone made a couple weeks ago that should help you](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7oyri/comprehensive_power_armor_and_mods_guide/).
---
Ive had it happen where the ghouls are stuck "sleeping in the ceiling in the clubhouse at whitesprings.  If you have marsupial mutation you can jump into the hole and shoot them.
---
Count me in. GT BassByBlaine
---
How do you start them
---
That's a great sight. It really makes the fight look more balanced, almost as if your party is more balanced with the SBQ.
---
You might be looking for the Elegant Tables sold by Pendleton at Whitesprings. The cheaper plan anyway. The more expensive one gives tables in the stash catagory.
---
But how many servers are full. I’m with OP. Survival is dying.
---
Rifle weight reduction. Pistol penetration. Other cards that even things out a bit or at least give some weapon classes similar things the others do.
---
Brand new ones would be cool too but first I’d like those.
---
A build with dmg boosting perks?
---
What a loser lol
---
pretty sure t51b is tied for best energy resist. and ballistic. so it's a no-brainer.
---
Nah chief, gotta get 2k+ damage Super Sledge.
---
Yea this is correct. I missed it in my initial searching.
---
It was actually a visual glitch for me. If you sell anything to them you’ll get caps and their cap stash amount corrects itself
---
Still too been cold up here in Northern Michigan I could go for picking some ingame until the pop here.
---
Same here, and it just started happening about 2-3 days ago, was fine before that.
---
What’s the point In playing the game if you don’t have to work to get the best stuff? Literally by your logic there would be no point in killing the queen and trying to earn better gear. Totally defeats the game
---
I am on mx way
---
Interestingly enough, most of the rivers in WV (or at least in the area I grew up in) are naturally green. I'm not exactly sure why but suspect it's something to do with sediments. However, there is unfortunately a lot of pollution from coal mines and chemical plants
---
Just hitting a diseased creature with melee is enough to be infected, even if they don’t attack back.
---
For all around the X01 is best, unless you're haulling a bunch of crap then you'll need the Excavator.
---
I've tried both (I also run a bloodied PA build) and the practical difference in rad res inside a mushroom cloud between t51b and x01 is negligible. you'll be eating through diluted rad-x, radshield and radaway all the same.
---
hazmat had a hidden modifier and is the only way to resist rads.
---
Wow thats amazing!
---
I do a no(thumbs down) then quickly do the heart to show it’s not meant as a nasty no.
---
Increased likb damage just cripples limbs faster. Completely separate.
---
this is awesome
---
Tks for sharing this. Cheers.
---
So would the rad resist really only work towards enemy hits? Meaning that really, I should aim for a T-51b?
---
bottom
---
They said if you connect power to it, it will show on the map.
---
There might be a bug allowing people to get stuff for free. Or like you said, a disappearing bug. That’s what I’m most worried about, but I don’t know if I’ll be able to stop myself from risking it. I just wanna plop myself down near vault 76 and set up shop, come home to some good earnings. Maybe I’ll move it to the cryptid event or SBQ fight right after and put down all my vending machines for the high levels to browse. I’ll probably regret it.
---
Unfortunately i don't have much money to spend,  but I'll put it on my list.
---
Ye it's active. 
---
So much so that sometimes you need to find a different server if you want to play with friends, since the server you're on might fill up.
---
It always seems though like people dont request these things *until* bethesda announce them
---
I’m from MA!
---
It’s dying because there’s no point in pvp anymore on survival. You get 25% of their level in caps for each kill. They hardly drop any aid items now, and people have op builds. Most people that did pvp are now back on adventure mode and along with them are the griefers again.
---
Or drills
---
My wife has an app on her phone called Candy Cam and she simply selected the Vintage filter from it when taking the pics.
---
I’ve found explosive, two shot and almost god roll sentinel armor at traders in the past, usually at least one cool thing per day even. I’m going to miss that.
---
If survival is dying the game is dying because adventure mode is a ghost town
---
Maybe buy something from them :/
---
crazy cool!
---
That sounds like a killer plan. It is so beautiful around the Seneca Rocks area, but those hills up there can be killer.
---
How about plasma cores. I’ll take a trade.
---
Not a PVE topic... read it again.  Saving PVP is the hope.  And it's not going to happen by "working" for better items that allow a player to be competitive in that environment when they are nearly impossible to source.  That's the point.
---
Visual bug I guess. I had a gatling plasma beam splitter and marine armor mods on me that should have scrapped into like 4 steel, I had not scrapped them.
---
I had switched to the components view to track other scrap and saw the 4.294 Billion steel scrap listed but I had none available for crafting. 
---
Just found it funny personally
---
glowing ones hit me with rad just as hard in x01. maybe not as hard, but the difference is not worth it imo, specially with a bloodied build.
---
I tried, tried selling a one cap item and the game tells me the vendor does not have enough caps
---
Well alright
---
When I sell things I usually do it at 80% of the average price so they sell quick. Even doing that I think I’d easily hit 100k caps after selling everything I have to sell.
---
Player: *exists*
---
Mole Rat: "I'll chase you to the ends of the earth! Do you hear me?! To the ends of the earth!!
---
The reason I ask is because today I picked up a 3* auto grenade launcher with the +50% limb damage modifier, and I was curious if that makes it any more effective in terms of DPS, or if it's just beneficial for slowing enemies down.  I knew that explosives add damage separately to any limb inside the blast radius, but wasn't sure if that legendary modifier would actually affect HP at all.
---
Thanks! I’ll check it out
---
I’ve already gotten the screws but I’d be happy to team up on some other PVE
---
Could probably still just pull mobs to it
---
That's such an epic idea!! An Atom Store Showroom! 🙏😊❤😲
---
We got a couple of sweet Mothman tee-shirts, a couple books as gifts, and I can't remember what else. The gift shop in the museum is da bomb.
---
This can get 2k damage in about 2 seconds and it’s FAST
---
No, because internationally the month is the second number in the sequence, and there are only 12 months.
---
I don’t have enough to buy what I need and that doesn’t fix my issue. Bought some plans from a bot but that only have it 50 caps after buying a 250 cap plan
---
So you're saying that if I broke my both of my hammers on her face, with about 200 hits each and about 300 damage that she should have died, as she only has 32767 health, and that should have done 36000 damage. Disappointingly, she didn't die. 
---
Obviously I had to have done something wrong as both of my hammers broke, and there were other players sitting around. This really shouldn't be a problem, especially for a build with incisor and as many damage perks as possible.
---
just disable legendaries in pvp. problem solved. no need to nerf everything to the ground, which would greatly affect pve and the overall enjoyment people get out of the game, and everyone is automatically on the save level.
---
Yeah! I loved the whole town. My siblings got shirts, and a pin.
---
A ramp event would also be awesome. Or at least a robot selling them alongside the road  haha
---
Low endurance means you get diseases way more. And most players run low endurance because it’s universally considered to have the worst perks. I only have 3 for fireproof and I get diseases all the damn time.
---
There is definitely a thing where players freak if you refuse a trade. I don’t get it. I was trading with someone just yesterday (after some dialog) and this one player just kept spamming the trade emote and trying to jump in between us. All in all odd behavior. Finished my trade and left the server. I didn’t want the guy following all over spamming trade. I’ve had that happen too.
---
I found them but I only have 4 of them at the moment so I think I missed one. :(
---
I have been collecting all 1400 caps daily. There is a glitch sometimes that shows the vendor has no caps. If you just sell them something it will show that they do have caps. There could be another problem I am not aware of that is stopping you from selling. I am on PC.
---
mods have been broken since the last patch  there are hundreds of topics about it
---
Okay, was just making sure you knew that because it's not uncommon for no one to be visible on the map through lack of kills (a lot of the time no one on the server even has a kill) and crouching, a lot of people in the top three obviously spend more time crouched than standing up.
---
Through your testing have you even seen a top three non team mate visible on the map while they are crouched?
---
Wish you had offered a few weeks ago! I threw out all of mine because i ran out of storage. What are they used for anyways?
---
Good to know.  My legacy TSE Gatling Plasma is one of my fav guns.  I’ll be sure to be careful.
---
Of course! I don’t want things ruined for me, so I refuse to do to one another. I hope you enjoy the surprise as much as I did!
---
Get yourself plague walker. Diseases aren’t so much a bother when they can take care of trash mobs for you.
---
Now that's a constructive thought, good on ya h-to the t.
---
Gatling plasma
---
At some point in the past, people complained about only being able to respawn at vault 76 or their camp if they died whilst overencumbered. Bethesda said they fixed that in an update, but that was a flat out lie - it still happened. Not sure if it happens now because I’ve not died whilst overencumbered for a long time, but it could still be broken.
---
Oh, that gives so much sense tyx m8
---
It’s a visual glitch, happens to me too. You can still sell for 1400, try it.
---
No difference
---
Alright. I have added you. I am on now.
---
I’ve got a vampires gatling plasma so I can basically stand right in front of the queen and face fuck her with it and never lose health.
---
Ah, ok. I've always been a melee build with a shotgun as a secondary, so I never used gatling guns. I just started using a combat rifle a week ago
---
The second time I fought the Imposter I only got a Syringe, right after I found and killed a 3* Gutsy,  and got a drill.
---
Am I a joke to you, Bethesda?
---
And 90% of the time these people dont have a mic so it's more annoying
---
Yeah shouldn't be able to destroy camps or initiate pvp with 0 caps IMO
---
I wish they’d come out with a DLC about nuclear winter.
---
What’s your tag. I’ll send you a friend request
---
I think PiercePotato
---
Weight reduction perks don't stack with armor that has weight reduction legendary effects, but Strong Back maxxed out will still work with Pockets and Deep Pockets just fine.
---
Bethesda charges an Atom tax on all purchases. And you have to pay tax after a year of selling or the lock your account.
---
I’ll check out the market sub. I tried buying from there once before but just couldn’t connect with the seller.
---
I make this comment rather often when playing the game with my buddies, I believe the “power fantasy” in 76 is fucked. 
---
An enemy that is 30 levels below me should not be able to do more damage to me than I can do it.
---
Those little ants are insane and shouldn’t be able to hurt me as much as they can when they’re 30 levels lower than me. My original comment about ghouls hurting me that badly shouldn’t be a thing either.
---
They have nothing to loss and the people they are attacking have nothing to gain so it's all in there favor regardless of the outcome. If they die oh well but if they kill you they get caps without ever having to risk lossing anything
---
Bruh which serums I'll send them to u
---
What's the effect on the Ripper? FYI repair it to 200% :)
---
Oh good! I’m not the only one that can’t find them.
---
It hasn’t and is still not working.
---
Was on the Sheepsquatch quest, and a guy offered trade. I thumbs-downed, and *then* he got on voice and complained, "If you don't want free stuff, it's your loss."
---
Dude, I didn't need it. If you'd said that in the first place, I'd have got on voice and declined politely, but don't be a dick.
---
Some folks seem to take it personally if you don't trade with them.
---
Not working.
---
Don’t rely on the SBQ for legendary farming until it’s fixed. Currently only drops 2* for me and the effects are so crap it makes me wanna die.
---
They do get a 50% pvp damage reduction but that's its
---
PS4?
---
UM u forgot the nukes
---
Okay, that sounds good. I'll go ahead and add you. My PSN is p3ngu1n_assault.
---
Yeah. I’ve also had moments where at level 100, I’ve gotten attacked by very low level players. I just stand there like “what?”. It makes no sense. You could literally one shot them if you really wanted to grief them.
---
Sent. So hopefully that’s correct lol
---
I have too much flux and nothing really to use it on and with player vending coming I thought I would buy the recipe and be able to make it for op as well.
---
Ok nice story
---
Well depending on what build the 50% doesnt do much. My character has low base hp so a guy hitting over 1k with a DC gauntlet will still one hit me with a 50% debuff
---
its exucutioners i think\\
---
That’s definitely odd
---
No need to downvote me btw, was only trying to help.
---
I get 0 caps listed for vendors all the time. Oddly some say 1400 and some say 0 but without fail after 20 hours it still lets me sell
---
Try spamming the buttons before proceeding through each part. I remember the agility part being finicky for me as well. Also on ps4
---
Ok, but as a warning i rarely play outside of friday and Saturday
---
Sometimes it says they have 0 caps and then i leave the trading menu and go back a few time until it shows the correct amount of caps
---
Yeah I always see people trying to trade everyone immediately after that event and requesting all the event drops
---
Xbox one
---
Same I keep myself at 49 hp because that's what I have to do to feel like the high level that I am
---
Then there needs to be hundreds more topics about it. Seems Bethesda employees cannot program or read. A shakeup of the ranks is needed.
---
How about this then. I’ll trade it to you and when you get some hold them for me since you don’t use them.
---
Aight that's ok with me
---
Leveling up doesn’t help. You have the same budget at level 2 straight out of the vault as a level 400 with all the cards.
---
I can mod your rifle. I have all of them unlocked.
---
Are you on xbox one?
---
Nice. As I said repair it to 200%. It is effected by one handed weapon perks. Take it to Whitesprings to test it out.
---
Understandable.
---
I remember that it was so annoying. Just run around like a maniac and hit those buttons a few times and listen to what the robot says
---
Had a level 12 pistol wipe me when I was on my level 10. I killed him then he seeks revenge and must have put on cav or sent gear because then I couldn't deal any damage to him so I just ran away lol
---
Ive gotten quite a few 2 and 3 * items but their like the worst items you could possibly get.  For example 3* wood left arm lvl 10...im level 144😶
---
This is the correct answer, sometimes you have to check 2-3 times or wait 30 seconds for the lag to by pass.
---
Oh wow- I think I read of someone Here who hast the same problem ( unless it was you Posting about it before).
---
Since it's not the usual  glitch you should definitely contact the Beth Support - If you haven't already.
---
Sorry to be of  no real help and I hope it gets resolved soon.
---
Me?  Just depends on where I am.  Usually use an arch unless I’m in a nuke zone then some rad away.
---
i mean without any one handed melee perks would it still be good?
---
Totally agreed. The few renderings of the products hardly tell anything. I was trying to figure out whether the bone raider skin’s shoulder lights are silver or red, because the renderings aren’t consistent. Before i could find out the sale was over. If they had a real set on display i could have easily appreciated the design.
---
It doesn’t, it stays the same from leaving the vault to level 400 or whatever. There was a rumour that it went up by leveling but it was confirmed false pretty quickly.
---
I only have 3 endurance so even at full health most pvp builds can one hit me if they get the drop on my but I'm a stealth sniper so finding me isnt always easy
---
This wasn't even the event! I was still doing the questline, picking up clues, nowhere near the spawn.
---
Is that event still available? I forgot all about it since Burrows arrived
---
Use X-01 in nuke zones, otherwise 51b
---
There aren’t any level up budget increases. This was a rumour that was proven wrong not log after it started.
---
Cool. And just a warning. You won’t be able to put it on till they fix the bug. I’m waiting for the same thing and trying to get the second calibrated shock for the other leg.
---
Do you know if they have any plans on patching it soon? There have been so many updates lately, it's crazy to think they just don't care to fix this tiny issue.
---
I did read it, and you said pvp needs to be leveled because players have better gear. And how do you get better gear rn? Pve. Being able to buy those kinds of items would destroy adventure mode. Yeah if everyone had the same gear pvp would be better, and more people would be enticed into doing it. But if we can all just buy the best gear there would be no point in doing events, no point in killing legendaries. I’ve done events and have gotten Cav sentinel gear. I’ve also traded for top of the line gear on here in which I got most of my stuff. Now with the cap pool it’s easier to get 1400 caps every 20 hours. You can use Reddit and buy tse weapons for 4-6k sometimes cheaper, can also buy armor or trade.
---
Yeah people are weird.  I'm not your person vendor or trash can. Dont want it drop it someone will pick your shit up lol
---
Well, one person posted that it was a bunny mask, and another had theorized that it would be some sort of bunny suit. I'm hoping that both of those are inaccurate, because that would be disappointing for the people who ARE able to get all 6 eggs.
---
Yeah ik, i also have a red headlamp I'm waiting to attach
---
Im PS4 but I'll make a post for u and send someone ur way
---
Had same happen when messing with a berserker weapon. Looks good, equip it, damage goes down if you have higher damage resist. Same with mutated. It shows base damage  but goes up when equipped if you're mutated
---
Why isnt there a good bone club? What is that, a scorched beast femur? Too bad it’s just as is.
---
No I agree you can look at my past post history I havnt said one bad word about this game but to let this slide unfixed (will be over a month) is unacceptable. What about new poeple just getting this game they have no idea why that basic part of the game doesnt work.
---
Ty. Sure I will :D
---
Yeah that one as well. The just red or red tactical?
---
Happened to me as well to two of my camps, floors are glitched something to do with foundations, tried everything. I had to move my camp as it was bothering me so much unfortunately, so you either need to live with it, move or hope they fix it and you can eventually move it .. to me happened with the metal stairs which were an eye sore ..
---
&gt;and people have op builds
---
Exactly as you indicated, which is what the post is all about... it was fun when the OP build was the recipient of the full cap level XP, but not so much now that those people grew weary of the unbalance, leaving PVP behind.
---
Tactical. There's a difference?
---
I think they thought everyone would want to look as funny or goofy/wacky as possible so that is the stuff that would sell the best. Maybe they were looking at GTAO for inspiration on how people would want to dress, but it fits GTAO more to look like a weirdo. In Fallout I want to look like a survivor in the wasteland but literally none of the armor in game or on the Atomic Shop is appealing to me and most players I come across look just as dumb as my character. 
---
Even the devs at Rockstar went away from offering too many silly options for RDRO and tried to keep things appropriate to the Western theme of the game. Which makes it actually funny when you come across a group dressed as Mario/Luigi/The Princess because they created that themselves to give other people a laugh.
---
I think? Maybe not. Lol
---
You can’t judge by how many people are on your server. You have to know how many servers there are and how full each is.
---
I play mostly survival, however unless I'm mistaken the extractors have a max storage that fills up fairly quickly so most of their generation actually goes unused if you don't empty it often.  That's the logic behind why mine are open.  As a roleplayer, it's open because I want to share with others who might stop by while my turrets protect the place from non-humans who might destroy it.  As a player, I'm aware that if I really need something there's a better way to get lots of it while also realizing that much of the time I'm not bothering to constantly empty the extractors by fast traveling back all the time while away.
---
I can’t really blame people for destroying camps in white springs if it has turrets
---
There’s a law for this but I forget the name. Basically you need to stop looking for it and you’ll find it.
---
I haven’t spent that much time looking but I have spent some and it’s utterly ridiculous. The few that exist are bought by people who already have it so they can get some easy free caps on the marketplace, it sucks.
---
Something we agree on
---
Works with character appearance additions too, don’t forget! But not clothes or skins. Which sucks.
---
Yes quite a few people have reported killing the SBQ after failing the event and still getting the rewards. So don’t give up if you’re close!
---
Passive?  I play survival much of the time, so I'm guessing that won't change anything.
---
Good effort sir!
---
Not sure but in tha camp section in atomic shop scroll down and you can see them, not sure if it's the ones you got only or all, worth a try to check
---
Now that survival is dying I see an increase in adventure mode player hunting. You take a workshop and minutes-hours eventually you’ll be hunted down. Let alone I’ve seen groups of people leveling player camps to get wanted and bait people into pvp. Survival mode is still in beta, it’ll be fixed
---
Yeah I'm a vats stealth sniper as well with 4 endurance. Fireproof 3 and radicool. I too die in one shot
---
Oh yeah that's an exception lolol..but most the time the ppl that own those camps don't care if anyone chills there
---
This will get nerfed quick but in the meantime I think you should sell it for a small fortune. Unless you’re already rich.
---
I have a vampiric one. Crap damage but I don’t need to hit enemies to activate the effect so it’s like having the healing factor mutation work in combat.
---
I think that if they were to do that, which honestly sounds cool, we may run into them having to do server maintenance every time that they updated the shop, due to it being physically in the game server space. Maybe they wouldn't need to, I don't know how their stuff works, I just think that's what they would have to do. But I would think that, at least some people, would have a problem with server maintenance like that.
---
My sent/assassin armor helps but I learned recently that sent doesnt work while sneaking soooo yeah lol
---
Haha i love it
---
I know but that's what I see everyday when I play adventure. I see more full servers on survival.
---
Well, keep in mind this is a Bloodied ripper, but here's what I've been able to do with it.
---
http://imgur.com/yypnZmZ
---
IMO yours is worth keeping because it's light, and at 200% repair it gets a massive damage boost. Again I would suggest taking it for a test drive before you make any decisions.
---
I can live with it. I built a garage on the 2x2. It’s a little close to my porch, but it works just fine https://imgur.com/gallery/8ZpsCd6
---
I had a similar thing happen when trading my friend for some Stimpaks (because they're the first thing he drops when overnecumbered for some reason, along with RadAway), he was trading me about 30, and suddenly there were over two million, but it was purely visual, once he traded them to me it was back to normal and we couldn't repeat it. He also gave me some Snallygaster Spit Explosion that's under Misc and worth -1 caps.
---
Check the wording. Increased recoil is on the low end, superior is in between and exceptional is the best. Not sure if there’re more words.
---
I have actually noticed the opposite. Anytime I get near it people will spam message me through XBL to get away. Happens A LOT
---
I still contend the continual nerfing of the legendary spawn rate and the inability to manage the loot tables will eventually end this game. Bethesda needs to realize that the legendary mechanic is akin to playing a slot machine. As long as we think we have a chance, we will keep playing and plugging in quarters. The more you diminish that opportunity, the less incentive there is to continue to play. I don’t expect a jackpot every time, but I would like more opportunities to try. Also, at least give me something legendary for killing a legendary.
---
That's really awesome.  A friend of mine had a base that you could only reach by falling off a cliff, which isn't as good but it was safe from spawns so he liked the quiet.
---
I'll help bro
---
I like the gatling laser. 50 cal would be my second choice. 
---
Bloodied is best. Furious and anti armor is second best. Explosive is the cherry on top.
---
no that is just animation it doesnt change which perk you use , you could test this by just removing the perk while in the power armor and looking at your damage
---
Murphy's Law
---
Where can the ones you found be picked up?
---
I just equip my pole hook, pitchfork or baseball bat and swing on it - essentially the same thing
---
You’d just crash constantly. The engine is far too weak and limited for anything faster than what we have, at least by much.
---
The horses sprint speed in Skyrim was what it was because anything faster would have made the game unstable. Well... more unstable. Unfortunately Bethesda refuses to get with the times and stop using their crappy engine.
---
I’ve noticed that it tells you you have fail something like 10 seconds before the timer actually finishes if it isn’t dead.
---
I have always hated how cheery they try to make the  atomic shop and to a lesser extent the game. It seriously annoys me, I don't play this game for the happiness and shit I play for how fucking depressing the game is
---
Thanks for the quick reply and for clearing my doubt as well!
---
Nope, stays two- handed :)
---
Imagine you have Just that more strength in the Armor you are able to use it with one hand.
---
I’m hoping they some ideas from Aion. In there you could just plop down and set up shop. Sell whatever you wanted for whatever you wanted. 
---
Obviously with a fallout twist, McVending machines and what not etc etc.
---
Instead of being constructive and doing those annoying things that I should have been doing this morning / early afternoon I made 25 server hops in an attempt to scoop this plan up. 
---
Resulting in finding (but not grabbing) the plans for tire iron, pipe wrench, baton, golf club, walking stick/cane and single-action revolver. The remaining attempts were all empty spots on that shelf. 
---
Will try again tonight, although I'm less optimistic about the results at that time.
---
Haha this !
---
I cant remember specifically which ones, but train stations. The'res missing persons notes on the bulliten boards.
---
I got a code from an online reseller for £8 a couple weeks ago. It was a second copy for me (Already had for xbox), so I wasn't going to pay full price.
---
This is absolutely the most awesome thing I've ever seen within Fallout. Kudos and congrats on this amazing reenactment.
---
Ah rip. But thanks for taking your time dude!
---
I think $40 is worth it.
---
Unless you live on the console, finding items in PVE to be competitive in PVP are beyond scarce.  180+ xp and I've not come close to a loadout for PVP balance.  My point is to try and salvage PVP, which by your reply, you do understand the need for balance.  Market prices online make it less likely the casual gamer who enjoys FO76 will likely stay long in a PVP server with the balance of power as it is today.  That will hurt PVP in the long run and eventually PVE as well.  Don't believe me, just survey the satisfaction of loot drops in the game on reddit alone.  Facts are facts.  Try a poll for the latest and greatest... I'd bet more nay's than yays.  Unless the developers continue to release new DLC, it will eventually have a negative effect on the playing audience.
---
Yep. Literally just got the key following the secret mini quest and found the X-01 Nuka Cola Quantum Paint Plans first try. The key is server instanced now though (so if someone else got it, server hop).
---
It's worth full price, so yeah definitely pick it up for $40.
---
Instead of being constructive and doing those annoying things that I should have been doing this morning / early afternoon I made 25 server hops in an attempt to scoop this plan up.

---
Wow awesome
---
I agree. They have been barren since Thursday. No one in Watoga, rarely anyone at Whitespring and the Burrows aren’t lining people up to try their hand. I server hop frequently and the number of nukes has dropped dramatically, sheepsquatch hasn’t alerted in days, and the pooled vendors don’t have much sold loot. It’s actually sad to watch the decay.
---
Whitesprings turret camps are the only reason why I have orbital strike grenades
---
I started the event today and only 2 people came. We lost because they were low levels. The map had like 14 players online because i counted them. People don't like doing event anymore even if it's free...
---
Unless you hide in some groundless spot they will come out and attack you, that’s how it’s supposed to work. But if you hide in a spot where they can’t come out from, the program will think you’re not in the area and thus won’t let the last radrat attack you, and you’ll fail the event. Just walk around in the open and they will come out from a spot right behind you.
---
Is there any plans to actually fix this or do we have to just let them expire?
---
Wasted a lot of time trying to do these in regular photo-mode thinking it would maybe apply given that the challenge was there. 
---
It’s really annoying that at least 3/5 of the last two batches of daily and weekly challenges have been tied to unreleased content
---
 Think the ants being quite powerful are a reference to how strong they are, proportionately, in real life. Which is cool. But the rest makes no sense. And ghouls are pretty heavy hitters, I know they have to do damage but hitting that hard is pretty crazy.
---
No worries. Sorry for the delay
---
What I get from this post: Why is "I'm Tickled Pink" not on the radio?
---
Storing any kind of inventory client side creates a host of issues, the main one being players being able to modify their inventories (duping is nothing compared to this). Even if they do try to prevent players from doing that, chances are people will get around their methods anyway.
---
Every time I encounter a feral ghoul I get some sort of disease didn’t used to be this way
---
Well that gives me some solace knowing I’m not the only one with this problem. Thank you!
---
First, what do you like about the fallout games
---
What’s the difference in spacesuits? I just found two and the one I wore was clean and shiny.
---
Would be cool if i didn't encounter a bug every 10 minutes
---
What did you use to get the code?
---
This also does not work for me.. :/
---
Ghouls do this too, it’s fun to watch the glowing ones do this in WS
---
&gt; jchamlin
---
that is great ill be on in a few
---
Yes I had it happen earlier
---
But as it is if you just run normal speed between locations, the location you arrive at is only half loaded in. Anything faster would involve you getting to a place with floating objects and missing floors for 30 seconds while the engine catches up.
---
Or the flying stingy boys
---
I’m not downvoting.. everyone is downvoting me for a problem they do not have.
---
also if want ammo outfits and ledg stuff more then welcome to it
---
Hmm. Back in the early days, enemies could bug out and not take damage. They would look like they’re taking damage, but it would just heal. This was mostly explosive and a fast firing weapons like the minigun. But that was patched completely and as far as I know has never happened again. I can’t think of why else you’d have been unable to damage her.
---
Currently the only enemy to have invincibility is the imposter sheepsquatch when the pylons aren’t all activated at once. The queen only has health regen like all legendaries, and is ridiculous bullet sponge.
---
You really need to do it maybe 5 times, does it still not work then?
---
You can tell when people only come here for tech support when they make posts that have been made 20+ times in the last few days.
---
I already have 103k caps right now I don’t think I need caps😅
---
I love my Roadster Capri Pants ensemble. The favorite so far.
---
Kkj7 yuh j
---
My absolute favorite thing is the exploration of the environments, especially when you can go off the beaten path and find secrets or things that further immerse you in the world.
---
If I could buy the Waterworld Kevin Costner outfit I would pay 2k atoms lol
---
I would say 20th of April, 2019. Everyone you know would use the first because that’s what your country uses, and you do it that way I’m with xx/xx/xxxx. It just baffles me, I hope you don’t think I’m trying to be derogatory I just think it’s odd.
---
I got a furious ripper the other day. Thing works great for mowing thru mid level mobs.
---
Well your gonna absolutely love 76 then, i think the game Excel in that area. If your unaware about the roadmap which is bringing more content this year. Here's a link
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
No it does not lol. Also vats crits destroy sent ass so does my mr handy buzz blade
---
How cool would that be, they should also have a questline forcuswd on the pioneer scouts
---
Marine helmets. I hope they don’t nerf the price, they use rubber and plastic, much more useful junk than cloth and leather. And you only get around 25-30 caps so it takes a lot to max a vendor. 
---
I rarely need to, tho, I scrapped weapons to sell are plentiful.
---
Oh I know all about that lol
---
It’s no problem at all! It’s very nice of you to use your own time to answer another persons porblem.
---
Happens to me in whitespring....ill be taking a ton of damage and BANG 20 ghouls pop up in front of me
---
&gt;We call those people “whales” and we thank them for funding our games
---
Upvote!
---
I purchased it for more than $40 back before Christmas and also as my first Fallout experience.  I'd say it is very much worth $40.
---
I run full unyielding and my 2000 damage melee weapons also do a number on sent ass but I never get that close lmao
---
I was just thinking this today. Seems like I’ve been contracting illnesses more often. Guess it makes plague walker and disease reducing endurance perks more useful.
---
Bethesda set up this thread to hear players problems and suggestions. Expect to see a lot of it. Comments like yours do not help. They do nothing. If you know a solution give it or move on.
---
Well ok then just go around murdering shit. Do you know if it’s really good against the SBQ? I know it would be good because it only costs you the repair materials to use it but is it much better than a super sledge?
---
Also, sometimes, ghouls are stuck in the roof. This prevents the usual respond every 15 minutes if new players are not coming into the area. I've jumped up into the roof and seen others do it easier with mutations. You can easily stay up in the roof and kill them below and up there.
---
Melee builds dont usaly give me trouble they cant get to me lol
---
Plenty of moth man eggs in point Pleasant
---
I’m pretty sure the data for these items is loading into everyones game every time they do an update, it’s just locked behind atoms so you already have it downloaded. That’s why there is no download time when you purchase an item. Displaying items like this shouldn’t be a problem, just like FO4/Skyrim creation club, all the data is already downloaded with the game on updates, it’s in the files already taking up data it just has to be unlocked.
---
I finished it yesterday. Pay attention to when the test actually starts. Also, in addition to pushing each button, running the course in correct order, your character needs to cross the yellow flags. I failed a few times because my marsupial character didn't trigger some of the yellow flags.
---
Idk it could be good but it would take a while
---
Mine has only been doing it since last patch. I just alt f4 at the main menu now.
---
I remember my friend did that once  towards the beginning . He had the trade glitch where we couldn’t trade with each other until he opened the menu with someone else. He proceeded to level the place while we just stared in disturbed awe. I’ll never forget his quote though. 
---
“All he had to do was hold E. Now he has to press space.”
---
They don’t.
---
Absolutely it’s like buying a car. It’s a lot easier to purchase it when you can sit in it, walk around it, look at it and imagine yourself in it. PA shopping should be just like a new car buying experience
---
They have made scorchbeasts and especially when the fissure site is nuked it can get really glitchy, but not everyones gonna be riding their bike at the same time so I doubt it would be that bad
---
Yeah it's just a situation where it be like that.
---
That's my roleplay. Loved the book, loved the movie. Got the atom shop postman outfit and love it.
---
I don't even mind molerats... they at least dont' feel cheaty in how easy they kill me and how hard it is to kill them like rad scorpions. Who I can't even run from when I decide I can't handle them. And I can't sneak by them cause as soon as they go caution they burrow straight to you and then instantly find you (as some one who loves sneaking and built a sneak build this is what really really pisses me off. Any other creature I get a chance with caution to back off and not be found but with radscorpions it's either not see at all or know exactly where you are. I know Deathclaws can burrow (least in 4) but even in 4 they weren't near as cheaty about it as rad scorpions (this was the same problem in 4 honestly). Hell, even if htey did burrow they would come up near you and you still had a chance of sneaking away. Rad scorps go straight to you. It's fucking ridiculous).
---
I get 2 handed but I always wondered why you couldn’t equip two single handed weapons...
---
That was fun I did a drive in the area and started looking for familiar landmarks like the solar array, the dam, parts of Vegas. It made me appreciate the game more. I plan on dc and Boston sometime. The drive included parts of the Zion I recommend taking the time to hike around there too.
---
Then you will probably like it. I spent most of fallout 4 ignoring the main quest and exploring locations, and fallout 76 is exactly what I wanted from 4. Game is still very buggy and has some gameplay issues, but it's getting fixed up and receiving new content every few weeks
---
You mean a full suit right? Yeah that would be a QOL thing I could get behind, but it would have to just be a shortcut to the placement of the suit and not instantly place you in it.
---
Also, it would help define my t-60/x-01 mix battle gear from my excavator. Both have atom skins on so I have to place both sometimes to get the right one. Grr.
---
I know you're being sarcastic, but I have a bunch of the stuff you listed. :)  I adore my Jackie Kennedy green linen ensemble, red stove, Ikea-easque flower pattern door, flower rug and red (not actually pink on my screen) whiffle bat skin. :D 
---
I do wish they'd add more post apocalyptic stuff for others though. It would make for a happier player base.
---
That is why we ask now brother!
---
I have been. This has been a trial all morning into the afternoon
---
If they did, it’s now a perk card.
---
i'v always been able to see the whole prize list no matter how many tokens i had. i made a redeem and then poof! gone never to return.
---
Just picked it up for $30 Canadian.  Enjoying it.
---
Yes!! My mom has two ramp patches she planted on a flat on the hill. This year you can really tell how much they’ve grown - they’ve started to roll down hill so her ramp patch is getting out of hand haha. She uses them in a lot of her cooking.
---
Yes but server stability is a major factor.
---
Hm i can't help you then sorry
---
They are already fixing it in a patch next week.  Keep up.
---
most radtoads have eggs on them when u kill them
---
I did see this and people seem to have had positive experiences with it, but it seems unlikely to me and I think there’s been a fair number of false rumours in the past. I hope someone does a full on test. I’ll probably do one myself but I don’t think I could be bothered to record it all.
---
And have the game crash even more frequently and shirty laggy servers as a result.
---
that bug happened to me except with fusion cores. it told me I had the same number of cores as the number in your picture lol
---
I bought the tricentennial edition at launch for 120 Canadian. I was pretty burnt at it going on sale right after but I have about 650 hours logged into it either way. I would say it’s 100% worth the 40$
---
Rng. I’ve almost always gotten ballistic and melee weapons, but I have found an AA explosive gatling (before the nerf) a two shot and bloodied laser pistol(two different pistols). I still have the pistols, but I sold the Gatling for 2k like an idiot.
---
With 20 something perception and berry mentats I'll find you, but I dont really melee players much I just keep those for pve
---
Mind you it’s still got its bugs. But it’s doing it’s best given its creators ;)
---
anything that is in your stash (that is sellable)
---
yeah, go up to Grafton and there are radtoads all over the place. easier than dealing with mirelurks and no way in hell am I going to deal with the annoyances of farming radscorps for eggs
---
Lol you can find me but so long as you cant vats me I'm usaly ok xD
---
Thanksgiving! Are there already information on that?
---
We visited family in WV last week and did some ramp picking and added them to fried potatoes that evening... I was in heaven. I've lived in Minnesota for the last few years and, as far as I know, we don't have them up here :(
---
it will work like the fermentor you will toggle which items you want to sell and set a price
---
This is disheartening and I'm sorry to hear it.  😟
---
I bought all those at launch as well, in fact I go back to Wasteland on my C64
---
I also feel like they should be marketing the Atom Store at me but are NOT
---
I have to diverge from you on this Atom Points cost, though. I see above the term WHALE is new to you. A few years ago I took the mobile gaming plunge and started some Marvel and Star Wars collector games.
---
The microtransactions in these new form of gaming are insane. The whale phenomenon is very real. 98% of a mobile game's revenue comes from 2% of the population. In Marvel Strike Force, You can buy outright 1/10th of a fully developed Doctor Strange for 90$ Canadian in their shop... different toons on different days, all earnable in game very slowly, but purchasable for anyone crazy enough to plop down 90$ for a fraction of one toon, of which the game has about 90. There's no logical explanation for old folk like us, cos it never existed in gaming like this before.
---
If you are still reading, these Atom prices are trivial compared to the billions being brought in elsewhere, and yes I said BILLIONS. This is all google-able, hit up youtube and search for WHALE MICROTRANSACTION and settle in for a real eye opener. kanid who you are chatting with sounds very reasonable in his/her posts - if you played 2 hours a week, and you could spend 5$ to avoid (intentionally placed there) grind, you might decide it is worth it as well.
---
Yeah it’s rare but good stuff can drop, that’s why those people buy in bulk. I’ve seen people buying constantly for over a week, probably going through hundreds.
---
no but we can tell just from how the fermentor works the vending and the diplaying items on shelves ect will all have the same system
---
Commonwealth repping!
---
Thank you for the ideas, bud. I guess I’m stuck for a while
---
You mean the cave crickets? cause those guys were always scary, even in 4. I think tehy were supposed to be scary seeing as they were introduced in the last DLC (which was meant for high levels) to 4.
---
Did you buy it yet? If not I’ll craft it for you and use my own materials for 400 caps. Let me know.
---
Well i think we all have problems with the bugs
---
I totally forgot about that...
---
Uh... What? It's a perk card. Select it when you level up.
---
SICKK..Nice work!
---
It isn’t about server load like most problems are. There are probably videos on YouTube that explain better but basically the engine isn’t capable of loading the world at high speeds. You be running the servers and client on god like PCs, be the only guy in the world and it would still be unstable. This is a hard-limitation unfortunately. The only solution is an engine upgrade, which is possible (DayZ did it) but it would be crazy time consuming and people would NOT be happy.
---
Joining
---
lol, I first read ”need to nerf burrows”...
---
Honestly my aim is shit now that I'm used to vats so you're right
---
Yeah it hasn’t come in a perk pack yet I just don’t have it to select
---
I'm all for it. I really think Deathclaws should always stay one of the scariest mobs in the game. I think Bethesda is falling to in each game we need to introduce an even scarier mob than the last. And I'm wondering what is wrong with having at least a few traditional Fallout mobs stay one of the baddest things in the wasteland.
---
I think you’re right. Girls love Skyrim, but do as many play fallout? I don’t think so. They hope to change that with an entirely female driven story and silly cutesy crap.
---
I feel like the aiming is a little off anyways hit boxes can be weird for some enemies but in pvp with everyone hopping around like a kangaroo vats is a life saver
---
Point Pleasant! Always so weird seeing my hometown in these galleries haha
---
First time I did the event, I got the imposter helmet. Loved the hell out of it. Later lost it thanks to a UI glitch dropping it on a corpse, and someone else taking it and not giving it back. (douchebag!)  
---
I've spent a ton of caps since then, buying the circuit board to kick off the event, basically bankrupting myself to simply get more of that dang fedora. 
---
However, my bankruptcy has come to an end! A very kind fellow player gave me theirs last night. (awesome person!)
---
My desire to play the encryptid event has dropped to near-zero. I don't need no more stinkin' fedoras!
---
? It's in luck, you should've gotten the option to get it a long time ago.
---
Use Q to zoom. On PC that is as you may have guessed. LB on XB1, L1 on PS4.
---
Exactly. I'm a kangaroo king so I can't be mad
---
There's a museum and a huge festival for Mothman in Point Pleasant. The festival brings in roughly 80k people each year. Iirc it's the first or second weekend of September.
---
I can head shot a kangaroo from 500 yards lol
---
I'm honestly betting on the vending machines only holding 10 items at a time (I am actually assuming that is going to be the limit). And I'm not sure they will stack.
---
It’s not there don’t know what to do
---
I went through all of my maps yesterday (using a guide online) and it gave me A LOT of stuff... unfortunately it was all useless except for a few random plans I didn't have (or really need).  On the other hand... it did show me a couple of random new places I'd never been to.  So I would say... worth doing, but keeps your expectations low.
---
I’m with him on this.  Server hop for days and most are like 10-12 people or not an active server for actual PVP.
---
Tf you using
---
No kidding
---
Depends on the server you're on. A loose collection of a small bunch of us who semi regularly do queens and this event together, did three cryptid events yesterday, while mixing in several queen fights. With that core of people server hopping together, we always had enough people to win the cryptid event.
---
Do you still have the bloodied .44?
---
Bad math mostly but I use a AAE lever action and can usaly get vats head shots constantly
---
I found a video example my dude.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh5i9QcKsEA
---
That’s in Fallout 4 which uses the same engine as 76. 76 even has copy pasted assets.
---
Um...you get perk cards outside level ups as well. All cards are unlocked at level 50. Just select luck when you level up and go to the end of the list to select Starched Genes. This may sound rude but how did you get to level 120 and still not manage to learn one of the most basic things in the game? I suggest you kindly remove this post; it's stupid and it conveys a wrong message to the already plentiful idiots who go around shitting on the game just because they want to.
---
I'm not going to lie. I would be spending way more on this game.
---
I don't think I put my point out very well as I was tired (I work Nightshift). 
---
We're both young and can be impulsive with our money, I used to blow anywhere between £200 and £300 a month on games and it meant I didn't have any savings. This works for us, we wouldn't stop each other buying things; we would just talk about if it's worth it right now (like if I buy a game now, when would I start playing it? Would it be as soon as it arrives or would I want to finish my current game which would take several weeks, and by that point the game is half price.)  
---
My partner has always been very good with money and has saving and I don't want all the financial responsibility's to be on her when we are both working and roughly make the same amount each month, so we talk about if it's working buying said products before we buy them and this works for us. In our years together we've never said "no" to each other but talking about purchases is a good way to chat impulse buying, which I something I used to struggle with. We each have our own bank accounts and a job account for bills ect, which also includes our emergency fund.
---
But the emote has a “c’mon,  do something” feel to is.
---
I think the items cost less in your budget tho. I could be wrong however
---
Oooh, so this camp being visible to everyone might be optional? Cause i originally wanted my camp to be a "good prices for stuff but you have to luck into finding it" kinda deal (it's not super hidden but I don't have it on a roadway or right next to a popular spot either).
---
Wtf just scroll to the end of the cards list when you level up.
---
Not much. Anyone can get tonnes by spending 5 minutes grabbing all the flux in sight with green thumb on. You’re better off keeping 20 or so on you for hydration. Raw flux works the same as inert flux, safe to drink.
---
Wouldn't know my game crashed during my fight with the sheepsquatch......
---
I have also had the same issue while running the Burrows. Using the auto tesla rifle (non legendary) and will start fine for first 5 minutes then all of a sudden enemies will get to 99% dead and then full heal back up. 
---
Switching to any other gun will also have the same effect and VAT will not even register the hits. 
---
like others the only way to cause damage after the bug occurs is to use a melee weapon. 
---
Up until the burrows was released i had not experienced it anywhere else in the game.
---
I preordered, and I'll preorder det next Fallout game as well, though I think it'll be a while before FO76 has run it's course.
---
I wasn't expecting a faultfree experience, either. It's a Bethesda game, after all, and their first online game at that.
---
Compared to for instance the launch of WoW back then, I'd even say it's been pretty easy going.
---
Not everyone wants to be a marsupial.  If anything, that mutation seems like a Gimmick/Status thing.  In the rare event that you absolutely need to get over a wall or up on a roof, the Jetpack is amazing (in spite of it's crazy fusion core drain).
---
Worth ! Ingame one of the best communities you will find.
---
The fact that areas load slower than you can run to them means anything faster than sprint isn’t gonna happen.
---
Haha....cool idea.
---
I think you missed the last part of his comment ;).   
---
Though I think some times people also go overboard on people daring to criticize Bethesda. I mean I can say what I think they do wrong and also admit what I think they do right. I'm totally worried and angered about them putting non cosmetics in the atom store but at the same time I have also recently defended them to some one who claimed seriously they don't listen at all (I do think they listen. WHich is why I bother complaining here and honestly encourage people to. I am cynical we'll get them to back off on the non cosmetic stuff even if I'm also hopeful because I know it's just too tempting when they see stuff like GTA get so much  money that way. And EA games as well).
---
You can have a alt with no caps and junk that you swap to and just blow up the camp.
---
XD Too true ken, only so many mutant pipe wenches i can stash. i just find it weird that its only nearly a month away but no indicator of how its going work.
---
Speak for yourself.
---
They very well could do monthly "purges" where they delete suspected duped items. Or the servers could restart and roll back your inventory.
---
Nice I'm using a level 35 bloodied calibrated handmade and an executioner's less vats cost +50% limb damage handmade. That less vats one one shots any low health builds
---
Apart from a melee or shotty, any other ranged weapon will do better vs a flying SB.
---
Oof
---
its all good! found someone that installed it (even though i now have the mod too)
---
Nice.
---
Moving weapons and armor is risky. If you’re moving aid, ammo or junk for more storage space do it like 20% at a time if you have a lot that you don’t want to lose. It’ll take a while but if you have a tv show to watch or reddit to browse it’s not so bad. Less risk.
---
I'm just glad it hasn't been anything good so far. Would be really upset if it was something useful.
---
Duper scum.
---
I don't know which is better but i run a sneak heavy build and it has made for some good stream clips
---
Good luck to you. Hope your headshots land on everyone who isn't me
---
Where are you getting these awesome legendaries! All I've been finding are hunter sickles and auto stim leather left legs all week 😂
---
That would be awesome, big Morrowind like mushrooms start growing slowly around.
---
Remove your mods and ini edits.
---
Thanks. Currently messing around with a gunslinger build so pvp isnt exactly my focus lol
---

I mean, they already made it but it's only a background video in the current Atomic shop.
---
Not sure why it's not a location we can visit in the game world yet. If it was, they would have to expand it whenever they add new items.
---
I was just playing along with the seemingly joking nature of the post. I’m all for more emotes
---
I could argue that many of the items I’ve purchased I wouldn’t have bought had I seen it in-game beforehand. 
---
Lots of it is pretty lackluster when in use.
---
I want my vending machine to be something you luck out on rather than easily found. I want people to feel lucky they found it (though I don't tend to play in a way that gets lots of good legendary drops but I'll be offering stuff I can for cheap prices depending on what I got an abundance of or if I found something neat but I can't use for my build).
---
Make it some sort of fungal creatures that pop up this time of year for us to fight. Loot your kills to get steak sized slices of morels.
---
i wish we could turn that off and still vend. Some one else said that may be an option?
---
Does mods and ini edits always ruin this? Or do I just need to remove it and then add again later?
---
Friend of mine has multiple mods and no issues
---
Marsupial is the one I bought. Next is healing factor, then maybe bird bones or speed demon. For selling, most people seem to be buying those, and a couple others that are good for melee builds. Marsupial in my experience was the most popular because when mutation farming with rads it’s fairly rare, and getting only the mutations you want and curing the others is a huge pain. I cured marsupial 3-4 times before being ok with the mutations I had.
---
We don't know yet.
---
This is literally me.
---
And never ending :(
---
Your mods are not updated. Update your mods and adjust your ini accordingly. A game that gets updates once a week cannot be expected to be running on old mods after a "long break".
---
Vendor loot lists are now leveled.
---
Coming you way bro.
---
Lotus? In her bin? WTF?
---
You will get at least 40 hours out of it so dollar to hour ratio is solid
---
Only happens when I'm farming the golf club, I run to the billards table and wait and 50% of the time after 10 seconds I start receiving damage and that's last for 10 secondes then the ghouls appear and I can start killing them.
---
I think it's just server/pc lagging on different things and between them they don't what's loaded/ready on the other end.
---
Buzz blade is better.  But I’d suggest a sledge of some sort tbh
---
I never get tired of these.  Great shots!!
---
Those are power armor mod plans, not power armor piece plans.
---
i'm not trying to sell it If no1 wants it i'll throw it on the ground
---
I'm currently level 120. Did I outlevel it?
---
Happened to me a few months ago with a regular scorchbeast, so I always put away my energy weapons when the Queen is at low health.
---
What platform are you on?  I have a spare set of small letters plans.
---
Happens when I load into a new area before everything else. I managed to run past the first part of the burrows  store they spawned in. Quite frustrating
---
Ah I thought you meant mods, I think you can get them from treasure maps? I could be wrong but that’s how you get t51 and t45, maybe that’s how you get that also
---
I had a weird invisible mole rat glitch a while ago where I couldn’t fast travel, I was in danger, but I couldn’t see or hear anything. Every time I stopped I would take damage. Eventually the fucker popped up and I punched him in his stupid face but I had to run far away from where I was trying to go.
---
Go to Whitesprings, all of the factions have vendors there now (except Enclave). I am not sure which bot has them.
---
My concern is people will be looting key spots and items just to sell. Lead, springs,m and screws will be impossible to find. Ticks will be hunted to extinction for their blood. However there might be an uptick in SBs for that sweet sweet ultracite
---
You CAN still loot it.....it's just nearly impossible to find.  As an AAE Gatling plasma user, I switch to my regular Gatling when she gets low just to avoid the stupid hunt for the ash pile
---
I keep my camp in a very remote location that almost never sees travelers for this very reason. Though I no longer face camp destruction for declining a trade, I’ve been attacked more than a few times for declining the trade. If I’m not on mic, I give a no and then a heart to try and soften the harsh nature of the no in that instance, but it hasn’t helped. 
---
Thankfully in each instance, I was more than capable of smashing my attacker, but it is still sad this happens
---
Also if you don’t use them. 5mm would be awesome as well.
---
the small ones hold 2 maybe 2 4 8
---
Good for bloodied builds.
---
I would imagine our whole inventory
---
Green toxic crystals aren't exactly a unique idea.
---
Anyone Else Fell Like Tiberium is Based off of Kryptonite?
---
Noice i might do this sometime. Any chance you can tell me where you git that sweet gas mask
---
It must have just been crazy bullet sponging giving the illusion of invincibility, combined with the white aura that she gives off being a bit confusing.
---
You and I both my friend. But we get pink pajamas instead.
---
Yeah, I've seen that the minute I just kill a radroach the whole of China knows where I am XD
---
And legendaires? God almighty, over a span of 500 hours the RNG God started being a kind God, and I just travel a lot to many locations and just do hoard events, also West Tek's (I saw a 3\* Suicider just blow up before I could hit him \*screams in not getting a drop except two mini nuke\*) not that bad, but I've had more success with the Sheepsquatch and Watoga Emergency Centre and Civic centre, plus Harpers Ferry. Oh and believe me, the amount of robot and metal 1\* star armour I get I to 25000 caps in not time if I didn't have a Caps spending probelm XD.
---
But chin up!, I think you'll eventually be graced by the RNG Gods soon enough, it;s just a matter of time Todd just says "eh why not"
---
Setting aside the moral implications of whether or not to loot the bag of a temporarily dead player... I think the real reason here would be that sometimes in the heat of battle it's hard to tell in a moment's notice whether the bag is: A dead player's junk (that they will come to claim), A dead player's junk (that they have abandoned), or A bag that a player intentionally dropped (of stuff they don't want and you can totally have if you need it).  Maybe a small symbol?  Skull and crossbones that lasts 3-5 min after player death and goes away if they don't claim it?
---
The game has specific affixes on legendary weapons. Bloodied and taking advantage of bloodied weapons in your skill tree may be the highest dps to answer your question.
---
As for advice, do what is fun to you. Its hard to be completely useless in the wastes unless you really try. So try everything and have fun
---
sweet
---
I would nuke it to me oblivion
---
Why would you throw something away when people will give you thousands of caps for it?
---
I understand that when the small ones are full they only hold 2, then the medium size ones hold 3 when full, and the large ones hold 5 when full.
---
But I had 3 large ones that would fill up.
---
Then I added 3 more but my camp didn’t seem to fill them up, it just sort of spread out what it would usually produce amongst the 6.
---
good job!!1!
---
OOo I did not know this. My Endurance is so low that I think sweeping my floors would put me into a good sweat. Thanks!
---
What perks, mutations, and STR?
---
All builds are fine the legendarys you get kinda keep ya in cheek more often than not there are build that take you over the one shot standard enemys for most melee builds ammo is a issue for some gun builds for people and power armor vs not also changes your build
---
That's really cool... Now nuke West Virginia so that it looks even more accurate. /s
---
You must find your own purpose, my son.
---
I wont be able to get on until later tonight shoot me a msg GT: KingManondorf ill hyu when im on
---
In the white spring there’s a green assaultron in like a laundry bin inside of a maintenance area, the bot has a name and a healthbar.
---
Across from it is a terminal stating something to the effect of “lotus remains in standby pending further investigation.  I told them assaultrons can’t give proper massages.”
---
LOL just today I thought I was safe on top of the dump truck at the service entrance but nope, a glowie decided it could also jump up there
---
Already morel season in full swing here in the Freestate.
---
I have used some heavy in sneak, so with covert operative it does pretty damn well for a start, but for sneaking I feel rifle does better since it can also use Mr Sandman perk cards which is an extra sneak attack bonus.
---
Would like to see incremental increases to our CAMP budget as they did with Stash boxes. Even if it's 5% at a time so test server stability it's worth it.
---
I probably won't even use the vending machine since I've been at max caps for awhile now. I would much rather be able to trade item for item.
---
Twisted muscles, adrenal reaction, [perks](https://imgur.com/gallery/zvj9bUz) , 34 strength
---
Yes a full suit. I agree youre able to place it down first. It would be great to switch between 2 suits quickly too. Thank god theyre letting us label them now.
---
If you've done all of the events and side quests and discovered all of the locations and built your camp and farmed everything you want...I don't know, go outside?  
---
At some point there is no more content.  Once you've seen/done it all, it might be time to move on to something else in life.  Or if you still feel addicted to the game (like my lame ass), you can always help out lower levels, try your luck in Survival mode, or make your own fun by acting like an idiot to confuse other players.
---
Excellent!  Carry on.
---
Thank you for your work.
---
no
---
Well one did train the teenage mutant ninja turtles
---
I had to restart my game twice for it to show up last time was strange
---
I know the person who's dad wrote the Grafton monster story. They did post a retraction in the paper but she's says she's not sure if he saw something. He doesn't talk about it much. It's still an awesome monster though.
---
You didn't actually describe the glitch.
---
Really? I've gotten more imposter pieces than than fedoras. Must just be bad luck (or good on my part).
---
I havent gotten 1 for a couple days
---
The Atomic Shop only checks the server and refreshes new items and new sales when the game starts.
---
So if you were playing the game and then checking the shop at 12 midnight GMT / 5 pm Pacific / 8 pm Eastern, you won't see it until you fully quit to desktop and restart the game.
---
5 is still available.
---
Hey I got a heavy build and was thinking of tuning him to a sneak. Any tips?
---
Did you try putting totally out of the game and restart your system? It won't show up if you leave your console on rest mode it won't update
---
I saw that too, my wife fixed it apparently by switching back and forth between our profiles and it showed up with 39 min left on one of them.
---
No. It's cumulative. It may have been moved to some other vendor then.
---
That’s my favorite thing to do with them!!
---
Maybe....not play the game so much?  I was really lazy yesterday and played for maybe nine hours, I accomplished maybe two things. I joined the BoS as a new recruit and worked more on the Top of the World quest (friended a Deathclaw). I spent the other hours just bs'ing and if you've accomplished EVERYthing in the game already. Put the controller down and go out side.
---
I use heavies. I feel like that class had the best variety and is just fun. If you don’t use any of those heavies or go to rifles lemme know
---
Get the highest score in all pip boy games.
---
Next day from what I understand. The reward was datamined a few days back if you wanna go look it up.
---
Well idk it's kind of frustrating. I'd like to use my new weapons, perks etc. for new quests or enemies. Throughout the main story i used trash weapons i didn't even like that much because good legendaries are rare and weapon mods etc for good weapons are hard to obtain. Now i'm starting to get the good stuff but now i don't have anything left to use it on. That sucks.
---
Haha never played one
---
Hopefully the award isn’t crappy. I hope it to be the nukashine X-01 or the atom cats paint.
---
no, but perhaps 5 to 10% more, or even allowing others to pay extra would be fine
---
I was playing at the time between egg 3 and 4. Dang!
---
Well, I keep hitting up all the Whitesprings robots and hopefully it’ll show up... maybe I’ve been somehow overlooking one of the bots. Thanks for helping.
---
If she regens, you have to deal with 48k health. Not sure what is your weapon's and character's spec and conditions are, but assuming a Sledgehammer propped up to 308 listed damage and Incisor 3, each strike does only 28 damage. You should have successfully hit her 1700 times with that damage amount.
---
It's not their first online game (facepalm) zenimax (part of bethesda. Elder scrolls online has been operating smoothly for years. Asset ripping fallout 4 into a half baked mess and lying to us about all the dynamic weather features and 16x the detail. Some fanboys can never see the unforgivable faults and lies we've been force fed...
---
Bugs that are almost a decade old ported I to a new game. Ones fixed by the modding community years ago.
---
The trash bag masquerading as a canvas bag and only after the community forced them to make it right to those unfortunate enough to waste 200+ USD on a "collectors edition" game still in a beta state with no proper QA testing.
---
Nuka rum in a plastic nuka plastic shell.
---
The vault leather jacket lmao... I wont even go there. (Basically made from a tarp) which the vehemently call "premium leather"
---
Todd doesnt want to spend money to make a new engine and it's not going to fly next time. Neither will the false advertised products.
---
Me too.  A highlight of daily play is checking the different vendors to see what other players have dropped off.
---
Link?
---
Do you have any info on the Scorched Killer's receiver from the Responders Questline? I've seen conflicting anecdotes here on whether it does or does not work on Scorchbeasts.
---
I bought mine from the R&amp;G station in the South of the Divide 2 days before player vending was supposed to hit. But with central vending I imagine one of the faction vendors at The Whitespring carries it.
---
I missed the first few days, is there a way to get the other eggs?
---
Handmade two shot explosive assault rifle. Thing is beautiful and takes out chunks of health at a time.
---
Same concept for it to say steal vs take. Like when you walk up to someones water purifier. It's still there out in the open but you'll know.
---
What in the fresh hell is that?
---
Yeah. If I wasn’t so overencumbered because of all the legendary things I’d spend my time going back and forth to that event.  For now I’m stuck near the Burrows lol
---
I do enjoy using heavies a lot, I feel a lot stronger just holding a 50 cal than a Bolt-action, for now I think I'm gonna keep all of them, but I'll see if any other help/tips may sway my decision on hording them or not.
---
I second this if there's a huge, overblown quest to kill a giant one that's rampaging across the countryside.
---
Wait till Tuesday’s patch 8.5 before you hunt it down, if you get it now you cannot attach it, which is itself a very annoying state to be in, ask me how I know!
---
You can still get the eggs that are  being released. But unfortunately I don’t think there’s another way. Maybe if people complain enough to Bethesda, bethesda will probably do something extra or something.
---
Even if I don't use Demo Expert?
---
I'm lvl 108 is this such an insane high lvl? I mean i regularly see lvl 200+ players. How do you even get there?
---
Ah okay thanks!
---
Same.  Especially since the serums go for 500 apiece at vendors normally, you'll have plenty of ways to clean them out everyday.
---
I think I have a good 70-90 pounds in my Stash wrapped up in flux I have no use for.
---
Finally someone did something like this. I’ve known it but it’s always good to have a guide and the one thing I didn’t know is they aren’t animals or bugs when they are scorched.
---
And here I was thinking of going to Helvetia and hoping those frog eggs were still in the river.
---
*release the complaints*
---
I do not have demo expert and it’s still great.
---
I’ve found a shotgun to the temple works.  Eh...I needed leather for a pocketed mod I was working on, and those Brahmin steaks are to die for.  A Brahmin steak and a cold Red Ant Lager will really take the weight off your shoulders...
---
Will dm it cuz I’m new and bad at /r and dunno how to find the link to copy. Plz post it here for the rest
---
 Look for them on the map. There are places where the Robot Escort Events and where the Wolf Pack Events occur. You will have to pay to Fast Travel to them but that's life. ;)
---
Radrats were the original Asylum demon.  Those little bastards killed me at least twice before I made it out of there.
---
 Stabby stabby my brother. ;)
---
Theres a static amount it can produce per 10 minutes (I think). Each type of purifier has it's own static amount. 
---
So if that amount is 2 per 10 minutes for the small purifiers (not 100% sure), you get 2 per 10 minutes until that purifier types storage is full. So the only benefit of having more is that if you are away for an hour you get more when you come back.
---
Ok dis-regarding legendaries for now, as far as I can see ( based on my stealthy sniper build)  the best rifles are the lever action and the handmade... The lever action has a slower rate if fire but with the right perks it can deal a lot of damage per shot - but the small magazine size with a slow reload can be problematic - I'm lucky enough a found one with a quad magazine, so 20 rounds per reload. The handmade does a lot less damage per shot, but even on semi-automatic it's rate of fire and accuracy lets you throw a lot if lead on a target in a short time, with a 80 round drum mag that is a lot of damage... I tend to have one of each maxed out and alternate between the two depending on how much ammo I have .... Hope that helps...
---
Looks like robolamb😂.
---
"I still love you Baaaalex."
---
I've got a spare one lay around somewhere.
---
I think I saw an article saying how some of those high level players, got there when the game first came out and they did nothing but farm somehow. I agree, I have no idea how they get that high other than playing non-stop. I JUST hit level 50 yesterday and I've encountered a max point on my SPECIAL.
---
fixxed the post. sorry
---
A lever action really does work wonders on them. The hitscan can hit them accurately from seemingly 300 feet away.
---
Not the same thing but I saw someone in the burrows and I waved to them i quickly realized I had inadvertently used the team-ip emote. This guy followed me around like a puppy dog for a minute before I had to bust out the 'No' emote and leave the sewer.
---
So my furious handmade IS better than my two shot combat?  Well al-fucking-right.
---
Chipotle is as American as baseball and apple pie.  10% ingredients, 90% marketing.  100% something King George would want to tax
---
Bos combat armor plans can be gotten from maps in the savage divide,mire and cranberry bog but there rare. I wait until i have at least 10 of one map before i dig it up.
---
It's an edible mushroom that usually pops up between Easter weekend and the first, maybe second, week of May here in WV.  Especially abundant when there's rainy weather during this time followed by warm, sunny days.  They can be yellow, white, black or brown.
---
We bread them with flour, corn meal, salt and pepper then fry them until they're a little on the crunchy side.
---
They're actually used by a lot of gourmet cooks (and expensive to get, too).  If  you look up Morels you will see more info.
---
Yeah like they either had the idea for it already and it didn’t work or they just created a fictional place for background promotion. I would like to go there and walk around everyday
---
A very tasty fungi
---
How to mothman did you get that?
---
this has been happening since i bought the game in november.
---
Yeah, the only reason I didn’t grab it prior to the update was because I was still saving up at the time. I can’t seem to find it at any Whitesprings vendor which is what’s causing me grief 😢. I’m hoping I’ve just been accidentally skipping the right vendor or something, but I’ve totally checked the Raider and Watoga factions multiple times...
---
Highland marsh has several catches of mirelurk eggs.
---
Look i'd just like some events or quests that are actually challenging. Otherwise i don't see the point of mutations or legendary weapons or power armor. Like what's the point of all thar when you can beat the game with the worst power armor and the worst weapons
---
It does stay the same regardless of the level. I suspect when camps use to have less to work with and the turrets took more space some people thought it was level dependent or something, not reading the patch notes.
---
U buy one from somebody or start a new character
---
I would love to see how these freaky (and equally tasty) mushrooms would mutate in radiation.
---
They should also allow conversion between atoms and caps. Maybe only one way, like atoms to caps but not caps to atoms. This will benefit those who earned atoms by completing challenges but spent all their caps when doing that.
---
Z 8xXddw
---
lol okay.
---
Just gotta wait for them to add new shit.
---
Keep it down!
---
I’m also running bloodied PA heavy gunner and I don’t die thay often. Rarely from rads as well. Just make sure you have your emergency protocols on lol
---
It enables the same versus as the Zealot's legendary so yes. Note though that it adds 50% to the versus boost, so if you have a Zealot's Scorch Killer's weapon, you get 30% + 50% = 80% damage boost to the reduced base damage, not 1.3 x 1.5 =&gt; 95%.
---
Melee is best for npcs imo or shotguns but it’s all preference
---
Yep. I recently swapped point out of Endurance. Thanks. That explains it!
---
the tip about muling stuff via boxes is VERY risky. Not because someone else might take it but because server do die from time to time. Not only that but if you pick up something from a box or bag It can vaniish up to 10 min (or even more) after picking it up. I have even modded stuff I picked up only for it to be unmodded after or just completely gone. Trust me it isn't fun losing multiple ass sent pieces or your fav aae stuff.
---
The grass seems to grow higher on certain servers  for me making it protrude over my floors
---
No idea. They're a pretty powerful throwing weapon, and also cool as crap to use. Maybe the relative scarcity?
---
Yeah, say what you will about the graphical fidelity of Bethesda's engine, it holds up surprisingly well placed alongside the real thing.
---
Found a nice mess of them today. Southern Indiana.
---
When can you play
---
24/7 nuke zone.
---
As a PlayStation player I’ve been saying we need a perk loadout for the reason that you don’t always use the same perk cards. I avoid certain perks just because I don’t want to be constantly switching out cards. We really need this on console because I use way different builds for silos and nukes
---
I live near Roanoke, va and a few friends of mine have already found some morels!
---
Oh nice good luck. I've got a bloodied pipe bolt action with extra vats chance if your looking for something on xbox. You can use both pistol and rifle perks with them apparently
---
I have a feeling we just have to wait until the Wastelanders content comes out.
---
I've always been confused why science was three - two level cards. Why not a single 5 level like every other crafting card
---
I'm on ps4 but thanks
---
 Yeah. I don't use VATS and I figure I get about 70% or so into her. ;)
---
Yeah I'm looking forward to it too, if only so we can complete all these danged photography challenges we can't do now.  The alcohol quests were one thing, but at least you could do those if you were determined.
---
Really, really great stuff.  I hope you work in illustration or some kind of artistic profession.  You're quite talented.
---
You mean another Dungeon that takes 5 min to clear out?
---
Very nice! We’ve only found a handful but it’s been rainy and about to be warm and sunny so we are trying again in a few days!
---
What's your psn? Maybe we can play sometimes! :)
---
From what I understand is they don’t want to trade, but want to see if you have the ability to kill them.
---
Lots of fun to use definitely waste like 1000 rounds dicking around with it on scorched
---
Gauss is not to be underestimated either. Pretty sure it's got the highest base damage for semi-auto outside the black powders.
---
I run both a TSE Lever &amp; a Furious Gauss, either will drop mass majority in one shot but I still think gauss has the upper hand (and a better legendary roll would help in my case). Reloading one round &amp; firing with the lever is extremely useful at times though.
---
See also: cave crickets. Ugh.
---
Bear arms is for heavy weapons
---
I used to team up, and while people were occupied with workbenches I would build brick walls around them and seal them in. Dump a bunch of wine at their feet. Wait for them to turn around and say Wtf? And shout " yes montressor for the love of God!". They can always tear the walls down immediately in build mode, but it's still fun.
---
Additionally, it counts as both an energy weapon and a ballistic weapon somehow.  Ballistic bock and highvoltage hefe both affect it
---
Yeah I mean lore wise it would be pretty easy to implement into the game. 
---
Just say that the vendorbots found some pretty cool stuff while exploring the map and because they are programmed to be greedy as hell they want to get some mad $$$ for those things. That's why the only sell them for a few day only to make them more valuable.
---
Give me your Psn you can have mine :)
---
I’m not sure. I usually just block them.
---
what am I going too do with thousands of caps? fast travel
---
I'm not disagreeing with what you want. I'm just saying to give the game a break. I've been playing on and off since the game came out, I'm only level 50, and I only really play for a few hours during the weekend.  I have something like 20 quests open right now that I have no idea when/if I'll be able to complete them.  The dev's will continue to release more content that we'll be able to play.
---
Maybe do a re-play and build a different character.  If you're so all-powerful, it's not challenging because you ARE too high up for normal quests.  It's like playing on GOD mode, what's the point? Start the game over.
---
Awesome cool!
---
I think it's the bunny mascot head, right?
---
There are and this would get around the issue.
---
I'm a big proponent of pipe revolvers. They benefit from both commando and rifleman perks, are cheap and easy to build/maintain and have plentiful ammo. Still just 6 rounds but it's a solid backup and got me through almost my entire Pistol build playthrough by itself.
---
Also 6-7 radtoads north of Grafton (very easy kills) and piles of mirelurk eggs at Highland Marsh in the Mire.
---
Fancy Lads, Cotton Candy, Gum Drops and Bubble Gum count for the candy challenge.  Very easy to collect by looking in kitchen/dining areas and porches around the Whitespring, as well at the toy store on Artisan's Row.
---
Thanks, I will send a request from alliekat85 in a few hours
---
Just adding my support and upvote
---
It can do some really damage to people like stupid damage
---
Buy legendaries, PA mods, stimpaks, radaways, water, keycards, ammo, and more from the market subs.
---
Does a gauss rifle count as an energy weapon? I would use it, but I've been afraid to because I have the Grounded mutation.
---
You might be the best of the best. Im an alchoholic pyromaniac that enjoys setting my friends on fire and sacrificing rabid mongrels to Mr. Pebbles. I want heads on spikes and a burn pile for the bodies.
---
Happens to me with specific floors. Sucks cause I dont know what to do about it.
---
Not commando! PISTOL and rifleman perks.
---
My wife collects gas masks and we're not sure where exactly she got this one. It is, however, pretty similar to the Hungarian model on the following page. The nice thing about these old surplus masks is that you can usually find them pretty cheaply

Please remember that while apocalyptic cosmetics should be more common, there is still a chunk of the playerbase that likes to look fashionable and well kempt. Like myself.
---
Start doing all the side quests. I just got to level 50 yesterday and still have SO much content to run through.  Hell, I powered up Posiedon for the first time this last week. Still haven't been able to launch a nuke.  I dont even know what the main quest is!  Fallow the Overseer? Kill the Scorchbeast? Cure the Scorched?
---
I just checked because I thought there was actually an Easter dress... You lied to me.

At least they don't breath fire this time.

With the way leveling cards works, once a card is unlocked, you can upgrade it every level after until it’s fully upgraded. So if a 5-level card is unlocked at level 10, then you can upgrade it at 11, 12, 13, and have it fully leveled by 14. Spreading it out between multiple cards lets them set multiple level requirements for each level. So instead of having it maxed by 14, they can have the basic be level 10, then have expert available at level 20, and master at level 30.

I was a sneaky sniper through level 50. Got an instigating death claw then and respec’d to melee. Recently at level 150 something, I got a 3 star bloodied explosive shotgun (my first explosive gun) and am now using a bunch of those saved perks for a shotgun build.
---
TLDR; change builds around to add variety.
---
Maybe! However, modders from the previous Fallout and Elder Scrolls games have shown that it’s possible to create a build mode that allows you to place items from your inventory as static objects. 
---
The speculative hope is that they’ll have weapon and bobble head stands alongside something like that. :)
---
When I reached level 60, I started a new character (two, actually). I’m having more fun in the second play-through than I did originally, because I’m playing smarter this time.
---
Does that mean anti-armor legendary prefix works with it, even though it is technically a energy weapon?
---
Sounds cool but that would completely ruin of what I actually wanted :(
---
Yeah the cave cricket also doesn't count towards insect dailys, tried doing the weekly survival mission and they did not count for it.
---
I will say that was the same for me. After I saw Lewisburg and The Cranberry Glades I had to get it.
---
I just want it because i can't find it and that irritates me.😜
---
I’m online now to if you still want to team
---
Dont speak too soon. The bombs didnt drop in their universe for another 58 years.
---
Any bolstering gear or non auto 
---
pistols?
---
Ich can nicht sprechen deustch
---
It seems to.  It is a ballistic weapon that fires energy rounds, but still does ballistic damage.  So AA works for gauss as far as I know
---
Ah yes. My family goes nuts over these things. "Shroom pickin'".
---
Side note, if u r on PC I have a 1* AA gauss I would sell u for cheap
---
Yes, they're worthwhile, but you need a high luck stat, whether by points, food, chems, unyeilding gear, etc...
---
Garbage bag. Me personally I didn’t care about a bag I’d never use and I consider 75% off a good deal. But to each their own.
---
The Responder vendor at Camden Park. Some of the plans can get pretty pricey, though. The co suckable mods are broke right now so I wouldn't put too much time I to them.
---
I figured it out.

I can picture June Cleaver with a........hatchet
---
After the main and side quests there isn't really much left to do. Do daily tasks and events that you find fun to do. Help new players. Mess around with CAMP system. Roleplay.
---
Just drawing for fun unfortunately, should probably go to college for it so I can find a profession
---
Oh ok, I have ever only seen the prize list according to how many tokens I have had. But its a known thing, to see the costume, you have to have 300 tokens.
---
Oh and thank you!
---
That's a good point with Starched Genes.  They should have made it a single rank that costs two SPECIAL points to use (like Lone Wanderer).  I can't think of a good reason why Starched Genes 1 is an option.
---
I don't know what the best answer is for the lockpick/hacker thing though.  Because, while it is inconvenient, it would also be inconvenient to swap out 3 cards just to equip your "mega lockpick" card when you want to pick a Lv. 1 lock.
---
Vendor Bot Greg on the north side of Grafton. Follow the stream west of the train station, and look for the trading post w a Responders sign.
---
Only if the players price the market and its balanced after. But most mmo’s gate the AH’s behind fees and don’t fluctuate pricing. Because its too hard to manage. Player vending makes more sense for this reason and encourages exploration, which is why theyre doing that.
---
Plans for the mods can be found in the same cave/area as the quest took you to get it. 
---
Aside from that, you can buy the plans from responder vendor at white springs or the train station in ash heap, also at the amusement park vendor. 
---
I've slowly been getting all the plans in the game. Have about 80% of the weapon plans learned, mebbe 75% of the armor but my power armor plan knowledge is at like 40%.  Its a fun little personal challenge for me.
---
I found they have the glowing keyword by default thus Glow Sight perk should work on them.
---
Are you sure about this? Some reduction just caps out. Like ammo can't be more than 90%. That's why bandolier 2 makes ammo reduce armor not really amazing. Because if this wasn't the case wouldn't bear arms and the shotgun weight card would become useless when equipping a weapon reduction piece.
---
Problem is you have to see the message first, that's the part you should be blocking so you don't have to be exposed to idiots in the first place.
---
I got a 1* AA gauss last week, they still drop.  If u r on PC u can have it for 1k caps
---
It should be run by the children of atom.
---
Bethesda, make it so.
---
I'm not that powerful, it's just the game is that easy. Ever since i got the excavator armor (lvl 25) the game is too easy. And i don't want to start over because the first 25 lvls kind of sucked. I could only use a hunting rifle and some other trash weapons. I really like playing with different weapons but i never got the chance because most weapons hardly ever drop and you can't get any mods for them. I STILL don't have the powerful auto receiver for the handmade and i crafted and scrapped about 30 handmades. By the time i somehow finally have the guns i want and like i already beat the game. Now i'm ready to do some quests but nothing is left to do. They said they're gonna support this game for a long time. But why? There's nothing to do. I want something like far harbor from fallout 4. That dlc was amazing. But in fallout 76 there's no such thing. They said nukes spawn high lvl enemies. Where? You mean the ghouls in whitespring i could take on when i was lvl 25? Idk it's ridiculous in my opinion.
---
Four leaf clover is much more effective with a shotgun, since each pellet has a chance to proc.. u can pretty much critical every other shot with rank 3 and a shotgun even lacking any other vats perks
---
Jukeboxes arent radios. They dont pick up broadcasts, they play whatever is installed.
---
That said i wouldnt mind collecting new song holotapes and putting them in my jukebox. Much like i dont mind seeking out the game holotapes for my pip boy.
---
Take the hint, Bethesda.
---
It's Easter Sunday - expected it to be pretty busy. 
---
Got on early and nearly max'd out the vendors' caps limit after buying \~2k caps' worth of CAMP plans. Remembered this and gave it 25 .38 rounds - danged thing has damage threshold so they bounced off its scaly hide. 
---
\*grin\*
---
I'm not expecting it to be a quick acquisition. I am grateful that there is a spot to get it for nothing more than the caps to fast travel (if I don't walk there) and the ammunition/repairs necessary to mop up some more xp from the assortment of scorched, zombies / ghouls and big green caps machines.
---
It's from personal experience but there's always the chance I'm wrong, I've never noticed weight reduction legendary armor to be worth while, it does stack if your weapons have the legendary though.
---
Because well right now 76 is kinda boring pvp wise
---
I know what you mean. I’m not sure there’s a way unless you set your profile as offline through the Xbox. Then again, it still probably won’t stop people from viewing you on their social recent players. I wish the was a way that you could set your profile in Fallout 76 as do not disturb.
---
You can get the mods from Welch station,  seen them at Lewis station and harpers ferry also. Probably other vendors as well. They will have no prefix, calibrated shocks will be named just that.
---
Yeah I've noticed events spawning inthe wrong place. Luckily I know where they are suppose to be so it helps.
---
You don't have to defeat sheepsquatch to earn those items. They're quest rewards from those other side quest added with this pass update.
---
I just feel bad, definitely only took me about 5 hops and had someone last night post that they got it in 5 as well.
---
I found a bug where the fire effect was permanent but not doing damage to me and persisted until I relogged
---
ok
---
You usually find the legendary enemies at nuke zones. I usually server hop(yes I know, I should be crucified) and find servers with nuke zones(usually on Whitespring). But Whitespring often has legendary spawns so I recommend that.
---
Yep, that's my account.
---
Why not craft a radio? They were added in one of the last few patches. I have both playing in my CAMP, and it seems to work well.
---
FUDGE! I wanted to get the nukahshine X01 for free or atoms cat paint....
---
Today was the first good sunny day in awhile and the nightly temps have been pretty low. Didn’t think I’d find any and was surprised. I’ll be putting in a good amount of time this week looking. Good luck to you dweller!
---
I'll have to try that then.
---
Im saying....why cant we have a jukebox option LIKE THE RADIOS to place jukeboxes playing something other than piano music so I can build bars and still have a jukebox...
---
Should be a capacitor issue. Both of my vampires and furious laser rifles have 36 rounds and my two Ultracite laser rifle has 30 shots.
---
I try not to carry just one weapon, I also keep a Tesla rifle a Gatling plasma and a Furious DCG on me. But the security in having an Arsenal of weapons that you can rely on and reliably get ammo for is extremely comforting
---
Yeah 40 is a cool price but I can’t wait for 20
---
Its also really helpful for perk sharing at low charisma, if I have friends with low lockpicking, I can share master lock picking and they get the benefit if they only have the first or second variant
---
I ran into insult bot for the first time yesterday, he said “vault dwellers are known for their awards, which one did you get, most likely to scare because your face is horrible, you got burned.
---
Only carry the one on my main because rifels weigh so much and I recently tried survival and it's the only gun I have that's useful for pvp
---
So freaking happy to hear fungiphobia hasn't taken over.
---
Bounty of the earth. We have a huge chantrelle picking crew out here on the west coast. Its a great family activity (great chance to teach about why eating LBM/unknowns is dangerous) and littles are perfect height to spot em.
---
Right now it has a standard capacitor on it. So if I switch it to gamma wave will it drop to 9?
---
Still online? I sell power leveling services.
---
thanks. thats good news
---
Ah shoot yup, that's the reason.
---
Regardless, they've still got to make some improvements to the system.
---
More management such as hiding cards from your deck, separating ranked cards, and ultimately loadouts would be a huge help.
---
It's hard to imagine a system where the entire system is based on swapping (and lots of it)... and it doesn't have loadouts.
---
Seeing these makes me want to vist the family. Grew up in Greenbrier County.  The place not many people (that visit for FO76)÷ goto but I highly recomend is Cranberry Glades. It's not the bog that is in game but still an amazing place. Loved camping there every spring. They stock the river with trout so the fishing is pretty good.
---
After the first initial quest, it only spawn one as a daily challenge.
---
I have an executioner Laser. Had standard, put on vicious, dropped to 9.  I just put a standard back on and it's still 9. Dont think it's that.
---
Right, I see. It should be an easy toggle I guessed but I actually have no idea.
---
Wish I could draw anything like this. 
---
Such vivid pictures in my head. But as soon as my pen hits paper, in afflicted with full blown Parkinson's.
---
I hoped the reward was gonna be the pink bunny suit the Vault Boy wears in this weeks theme art. Has a nice A Christmas Story vibe to it I thought. 
---
Plus I’d like a stupid hot pink bunny costume for when I’m always out here bunny hopping around. 🐇 🐇🐇
---
Have you seen the gut-shroom in the burrows? I think they already did.
---
Are you using a sniper barrel? That’s the only thing I can think of that would lower your shots by that much.
---
Wow. I love this. Baa!
---
Weapon weight reduction armor stacks with weapon weight reduction perks for sure, like bear arms and martial artist.
---
If you have the original you can craft a lvl 50 replacement
---
It caps at roughly 50% bonus damage and accumulates at a rate of about 5% per hit.
---
Have you seen the Gut-shroom in the Burrows? Maybe they already have.
---
it's a known bug and will be fixed...um...
---
You aren't but he might be. It's an online game, age differ wildly sometimes.
---
It's baffling how a room(s) that are supposed to be secured, will have enemies in them.  This is a TOP SECRET military bunker, follow this (hour long) quest line to obtain the only key to get entry. Get in. Have to fight several enemies.
---
Okay thanks bro
---
Holy shnikeys that's it!  Thanks!
---
I haven’t messed with the options. I play the Appalachia radio station on my Pip-Boy, and that’s what’s plays on the radio in the camp. I guess I haven’t tried to change what’s on the Pip-Boy to see if it changes what’s on the radio. I just have the easy listening stuff on the jukebox on one floor and the radio on another floor. I imagine it might be expensive to license a ton of different music for the radios and jukeboxes.
---
Yes, been happening on PC for me as well.
---
The cap limit will work the same as selling to vendors now (you get no caps but still lose the item). So your vending machine ends up selling 30-40 god roll items but you get no caps because you forgot you were already near max caps.
---
Eh, for that deal I’d say it’s worth it. Helmet and bag are pretty neat but I definitely wouldn’t pay $200.
---
Hmm why not, not every ghoul is bad :)
---
I really really love using the crossbow....but it has no mods and is vastly underpowered for having 1 shot.
---
I actually didn't know there was armor that reduced the weight of weapons, I meant chems, food/drink, ammo and junk.
---
Always go for the stabilized barrels. For semi or auto for auto. The tuner gamma capacitor is top for dps and burn. Also should give 36 shots.
---
never seen this post before...
---
This is fantastic. I love the mothman pic!
---
I just want to roleplay as Hitchcock tbh
---
Automatic handmade rifle and hardened handmade rifle
---
only a half-joke, it's hilarious how much this gun outclasses everything else unless you have some kind of a specific build. I would suggest an automatic tesla rifle (quad or double if you can get it) but that's known for currently still causing the damage bug
---
I've got random ones and I dunno where I got them. I know vendors sell them but is there a way to get them for free?
---
It's called survival. No objective just be the biggest douche you can be with all these no skill and broken setups.
---
I don't get it, none of my weekly challenges match what's discussed here..
---
Yea but maybe they were rad roaches! Roaches can get anywhere!!! Also what’s the deal with the damn scorched aimlessly shooting at the roof outside!? What’s the deal with that?
---
I dont play survival. Tried it once wasnt fun to me
---
Yes    I cannot stop my lower inside walls from blinking through the upper floor. 
---
I thought it was just me and I removed and replaced with no changes
---
I don’t think so
---
That tip about lead and the lucky hole mine, just did a brief run with a friend and ended up with over 450 lead scrap. Thank you!
---
Nice post, it's mostly intuitive but knowing the weird exceptions is really useful.
---
fwiw I don't think Snallygasters would count as animals, based on their lore they seem to be the 76 equivalent of Centaurs. It seems like most cryptids are above the regular enemy categories - the Flatwoods Monster, Grafton Monster, and Wendigo aren't in any of these categories either. (other than the scorched variants anyway)
---
Horde events require you to search for the leader sometimes.
---
Another reason I look forward to this time of year, great idea!
---
Can we buy stuff with pre-war $$$?
---
So ass cav/sent is an easy kill for you guys? It's pretty much the strongest defense in pvp. What do you consider strong then? I am aware of crits, stumbles rads etc vs those setups but still.
---
Noticed that with uranium fever. No way did it change locations I thought.
---
Hmm. So time to get a Zealot 'scorched' weapon for SBQ time.
---
If this is known bug sorry I just haven't heard about it.
---
I have a 1* lvl 50 Anti armor super sledge for sale for 500 caps. Also have an identical one but Bloodied instead if that suits.
---
Yes but this bug occurs not only with horde events
---
If you mean after the mistaken identity quest, yes, those dailies are singled out as the most difficult to trigger. I used to be able to get them to trigger regularly just south of the widows watch on the other side of the ash heap but not anymore. There are other areas that seem to get them to trigger but nothing reliably.
---
I have no real data to go on, but believe with a BE harpoon, the PA build is the way to go.
---
With the PA armor pen I believe you will be able to one shot better after the first shot is done, where as with the sneak sent/assassin you will have more shots but they are less likely to finish the opponent off. I think the standing still with the slightly less long reload will hurt you more than being mobile while reloading.
---
Are we completely certain there is a reward?
---
Thanks, but... I have one I have not been using, just saving it to turn into tokens for the Legendary Vendor since I assumed the AA stat was useless for it. Thanks for the offer though. Gonna try my bad boy out a bit then.
---
My build is all vats crits and anti armor weapons seem to hit through then and I have one of those. Personally I get murdered in survival somehow. Guys with full auto handmades somehow one tapping me with one bullet.  No clue how but I dont play survival anymore
---
Fighting off a psychic sentient mushroom hive mind invasion would be great. 
---
Bonus points if there’s a talking NPC that isn’t a robot even for three lines.
---
Yes. Bethesda even teased about getting a reward.
---
Oh okay, thank you!
---
It's definitely 5% per hit. Measured that in a test and confirmed in the ESM.
---
I'm less sure about the cap. There's a value of 9 in the parameter which could well be a maximum. I couldn't get it above +30% damage in practice, but there may also be a duration limit (10 seconds?) which could explain that.
---
Should be fixed Tuesday. A quick google search pulls up a lot of threads about this.
---
Seasonal forageables would be awesome! What do you think they's be in a nuke zone? Like sickly stinkhorn? Or luminous dryland fish?
---
Super sledges suck, fist weapons are where it’s at.
---
My fiddy cal has come in very handy down in the Burrows, haha. Nice tight hallways, they all just line up!
---
I hate them.
---
Lvl 3 is unlocked at the certain lvl. You can't get it before
---
Can someone in charge of such things put a giant banner on the front page of the site that says "mods are broken".
---
Someone else said it best: Radscorpions are mole rats in Power Armor.
---
They meatpiled before I could screenshot. They were Charred Feral Ghouls.
---
he definitely needs done kind of buff, he shouldn't one shot a deathclaw, but I feel remorse for spending the perk points on a level 10 buddy while I'm now at level 50...
---
Do you mean Hancock
---
Leave the server is probably your best option.
---
My problem with the time one was it was totally out of your control, you could be tooling around in your camp, \*blam\*, hunted. Walking to a vender, \*blam\* hunted, clearing a dungeon \*blam\*. hunting a person \*blam\* they saw you coming, it was just so random when you would end up at the top of the leader board, and there was only that one way to control it, which was not a fun way of doing things, because it meant you would get visits every hour, unless you died on your own, or cheesed the hell out of it.
---
With kills at least you have to be doing something active, do I want to clear ghoul hordes knowing I will get hunted, or will I kill scorchbeasts, mirelurk queens, and other big beasts to avoid drawing attention to myself. Ok I want to make a shop run un harassed, maybe I'll try not fighting things and clearing every enemy on the way. There is a choice there, even if you eventually have to kill things and will have to deal with it.
---
The problem with this one, is that finding a player who hasn't killed is almost impossible, and killing the top three means fighting players who are in the best position to win that fight. So 90% of people avoid the leaderboards altogether. Which I will agree is a problem.
---
Oh the guy wasn't aware how to counter vats. I wanted to say people with those setups can easily rack up 40 kills if they have more than 1 braincell. I've seen it and been there myself. Always feels cheap and not really enjoyable.
---
The red asylum Outfit with a golf club or shotgun depending on my mood 😂
---
That was my original line of thinking honestly. My only concern at that point is them killing me first if I’m not getting the jump on them, which in PA seems difficult lol.
---
When to a event today and only 4 of us turned up and everytime I became the pylon I died as I'm running a bloodied build,but we did try and lost in the end seems this event is dead already.
---
Ope. I have been watching a little to much Brooklyn 99 lol
---
How about this - after you earn them, you can optionally combine all 3 into one card?
---
What do you mean?
---
West tech is also a good legendary farm location.
---
The amount per hour doesn't change based on how many purifiers you have. It only determines how much total storage space you have available.
---
How a major feature like this can go unfixed for so long is beyond me.   Should of been a hot fix.   This bug never should of been released.
---
What? 😂 They have the highest melee damage, excluding Deathclaw Gauntlet and Power Fist, which makes it the strongest for nukes.
---
Damn. I missed the first one because I hadn't played in a while and didn't realize this was going on. Guess I'll just make do with my 5 eggs. :/
---
I guess so, I've just never had that situation... if I'm on a team and we need to lockpick something, and another member doesn't have the top perk (or doesn't want to equip it), I'll just do the lockpicking.
---
WWW - Whitesprings, West Tek and Watago
---
This could be away around intense server stability issues. 
---
Give players a fallout 4esque vault cave to hole up in. Allow for multiple entry exits so people can attempt a raid but it can still be defensible by those in the base should they have the right gear
---
🤔
---
Unfortunately, it seems like some players will use any excuse to start griefing.  I don't know why they seem to be coming back to adventure mode.  They have their entire separate world to teabag each other.  Maybe they think all the adventure players are low hanging fruit with little in the way of defense.
---
I made a somewhat similiar post the other day. A commenter told me unarmed and 2h are pretty balanced and 1h is slightly behind. No one has really done the leg work to figure out what is mathematically best.
---
That was so frustrating.  Why is blowing up random player's camps even an option??
---
Have the same problem
---
Mothman eggs are definitely the easiest outside the statue. Frog eggs off the frogs at the whitesprings golf club.
---
90% of the time happens to me.   Two different PC with different hardware.
---
It's pretty niche, but its helpful at times. I think last time I played it worked long distance too, but it's been a while.
---
Well you kill a guy in survival you get like half the caps of his level I think while in adventure it's full level so they go to adventure to pick on people. I also think that they dont want people able to fight them befor they decide to attack
---
Really?
---
Could I please get the link also?
---
Do you lose the plan when you complete it and do you need a shovel.
---
There are 3 different pickpocket cards, as each one of them only requires 1 skill point to unlock but only give you +1 picklock point each. The first picklock perk, being “picklock” gives you +1 picklock point and is unlocked at level 5. The second one is “expert picklock” which is unlocked at level 19 and gives you +1 picklock point, and the final one, “Master picklock” adds another 1 picklock point and is unlocked at level 40. You have to use all 3 of these perk cards at the same time to get a level 3 picklock skill. Hope this helped and good luck!
---
Personally named weapons and anything with atom shop cosmetics are hidden, so they'd never know if you have a really ferocious gun.
---
Yes and no
---
it should be re-entering the vault to get to the atom shop
---
Don't feel bad, please. It's a Sunday holiday. Once the churchgoers return home and messily dispatch dinner/supper odds are not in my favor. I'm okay with it. Maybe tomorrow or Tuesday it'll only take me 5 hops. 
---
I'm an EvE Online veteran (10 years' and change played time), so the long game is an old, comfortable hat. 
---
76 is a different beast than its predecessor despite the nominal similarities. It's taking a while to adjust. \*grin\*
---
Get all the high level loot mod out pa camp weapons
---
Yeah, find it ridiculous that PA has a sneak option when the mechanical stomps can be heard for miles. It would be more of a running up, "I'm here to fight the ~~four~~ three of you!" style than the ambush.
---
Holy steel
---
What’s the deal with the 200% repair = more damage? Is this just the ripper?
---
* watoga
---
Nine NIIINE
---
High lvl heavy Leather armor limbs are actually pretty good. Fully Repaired to 200% they have very high Energy Resistance and only a few less Physical Resistance Points then Combat Armor.
---
So no matter how much you fire, after ten seconds it resets? That value of nine, would that be nine hits and then it resets or would it reach max cap then wait the rest of the time maybe eight seconds, if it were on a minigun, and then reset back to zero percent? Also one last question, was the five percent base damage or the damage total including any extra Legendaries like explosive or any perk card bonuses?
---
Sorry yes
---
Great thanks I've got a lot of maps in my stay so I'm going tresure hunting.
---
I’m on PS4 and play usually with just one other friend irl, I’m 27 years old and would love to play with another regular player lol currently level 34*ish
---
Found a few maybe 25 in the vendor not chad at the fairground, can’t remember the name of it😂
---
Is this from personal testing or datamining or anything? I've seen these types of numbers thrown around a lot but I can't find any evidence to support it
---
Sneak card, agility, armor weight and the sneak legendary effect(not chameleon) determine how long or fast they can target you. Stealthboy removes you from vats completely even after the chameleon effect is gone. Plus you can use the covert op mags if you really need to.
---
crits negate legendary effect but you can still bump up your ballistic defense. Full combat and marine armor is kind of bad in comparison to some options you have.
---
Sounds good. Happy Easter!
---
Oh, we have very similar builds! I'm kinda interested now. Would you be willing to sell for a few thousand caps?
---
I can get on now if that works
---
Pay caps
---
Same with me I’ve been running around getting my treasure maps done, nuking a few thing here and there,  fighting scorched beast trolling people with explosives by blowing bodies of enemies away, and just enjoying the game
---
Well, at least now I know why I remain in inexplicable \[danger\] even inside the hotel or fast traveling from Watoga to Vault 76.  I shouldn't be able to fast travel while in \[danger\], but I can when it's one of those random perma-danger times that requires a server hop to get rid of.
---
Well all pvp builds are broken in ways. I can counter stealth people easy all I have to do is tag them once and I can vats them. Kind of hard to manually shoot them when they are jumping around like a kangaroo
---
Add me, PettySweaty, I’m level 34 and down to adventure anytime
---
I saw it a couple of times in the station at the north end of the Savage Divide.  If you have the perk for cheaper prices and some grape mentats you can get it for 9200.
---
Yeah sometimes if u use the Elevator and Enemys are nearby, theyll spawn inside the Elevator when u are about to load in in the next floor. Happens pretty often to me and its annoying since u are not able to move during the Loading Screen.
---
Don't I know it! 😁
---
Yeah happens when I enter an area before everything has had a chance to load.
---
Haha that's a nice story
---
Bethesda would consider that OP.  
---
Radscorpions immediately spotting you after you shoot one and swarming you in a pack with excessive poison damage and stagger effects, totally legit.
---
No....when you hover the radio in build mode you can swap left and right to select if you want a "Appalachia Radio" or Classical Radio...it has never once been effected by whats on your pipboy
---
Ok. What do you have in mind that we could do
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
True the pvp feels really cheap and without other objectives/motivation survival is a mess. You still can't target a stealthboy user after you hit him once. Yeah kangaroo sentinels are lame. Add a tesla to that and it's pvp in a nutshell atm.
---
You gotta turn it off, but you can keep it off now - you can’t damage other players in Adv anyway.
---
Sometimes they go for the one with lower health.
---
I got a plan for a T51b torso from one.
---
Is that true? I'm sure I had my named items show up in the requested items when someone was trading with me.
---
I could tell it was children -- they always hop around like they're playing fortnite.  :/
---
After 50 its a find your own adventure game.
---
Figure out what is fun to you and do it. I like building CAMPs and move once a week (I also party with lowbies to help with events and build a little in their camps... shhh). I farm legendaries. I've made 2 new characters because I found a shiny and wanted to build a character around it, but didn't want to lose the bliss I get from big guns. I do SBQ whenever ammo permits because I enjoy the big boss fight, even though its not really threatening anymore. Occasionally I mess around in survival (and often lose) because its thrilling.
---
Played since beta. The games had a few issues but I’ve enjoyed it from the first time I started my character. In all honesty it’s up to you. If your looking for a stable online game with in-depth multiplayer content such as GTA V’s businesses or Rust’s team based survival then the game may not be for you. However if you have the time to explore Appalachia, create a home from your camp and learn some of the local lore then  you will fall in love with the game. Besides it’s usually on sale in a few places ;)
---
Thank you. I am a casual player, so my level is just not high enough yet. I appreciate the info.
---
I hate the pvp is so unbalanced right now. And yeah stealboys are a oain
---
Nope you can use campfires though
---
Yes, you get a huge damage boost at 200% repair. It works for the Ripper, Mr. Handy Buzzsaw and the Chainsaw.
---
Zealot's Prime! I've also updated [the weapon damage calculator](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) to properly handle a Zealot's Scorch Killer's weapon in case you want to experiment with setups.
---
Can found mods/plan around Ash Heap region.
---
Camden park, Grafton and white spring resort have plan to purchase.
---
Except that radscorpions share the same properties.  If you get 2-3 high level ones swarming you, there's no escape.  The stagger effects and poison damage are outrageous, and there's no meds to take to mitigate poison, aside from getting lucky with a couple 2-3\* legendary armors with poison resistance.  You literally can't stimpak fast enough if you don't wear power armor.  Taking one hit from a stinger is fine, but the effects seem to stack and get insane when you're getting gangbanged.
---
When i started the game i was going for rifles. I still use them but i think if you don't own good legendary rifles then they're useless. You don't find enough ammo and the dmg is not enough. A normal fire axe is better than i fully modded whatever rifle, cause it has high dmg, doesn't need ammo and is extremely cheap to repair.
---
Maybe the ghouls are former military or BoS
---
Well, the good news is they won't be able to do it much longer. In the meantime if you move camp a couple of inches it should blueprint your existing buildings so you can put them back in one piece without having to repair.

Or they could make it so that you can "inspect" them,like how you can with every other item in fallout.
---
Totally. I've got a bloodied one shot exploding lever action that's a lv 20 weapon, and it's fine, but holy shit do I kill myself CONSTANTLY with it, lmao. It's almost not worth the low durability and constant threat of self-crit to carry it, but it is good at long range surprise crits, so that's nice at least, lol.
---
No problem at all, let me know if you need anything else
---
It would make more sense if they marked Mutant Hounds as super mutants because they only ever spawn alongside Super Mutants. Great post though u/akarnokd
---
Doing the Lord's work on Easter, thank u
---
It may not be a role-playing game anymore but the architecture is still there. Game mechanics are in place for you to play however you want. Sure there are memes out there as op builds, if that's what you want there is plenty of information out there but I play for myself. How would you survive in the aftermath of an apocalypse? Answer that and give it a go.
---
YES YES YES SO MUCH YES. I am a workshop whore and absolutely resent mole rats because of this.
---
Dude...like 500 hours in and I'm like TIL.
---
Just go to your nearest supermarket. You can get a variety of dog food from there 😂
---
Rumor has it Bethesda reduced the number of 3 star legendary being dropped. I have one in almost 700 hours of play. You just have to hit the right events enough to hit one. Not exactly easy to do. Also check Nuke Zones after they end and the vendors for dropped or sold legendary items. I have a 2 star machete which I modded into a three star with the sacrificial blade mod.
---
I think its in way better shape now than it was at launch. It is more stable. There are less performance issues. The community is great! I have been playing in short intervals since launch(level 66 now), I love how everyone in this game is helpful. You mind find it frustrating at younger levels though. There is that occasional server disconnect. Also, the most frustrating thing I experienced was how an entire area was leveled wrt the highest leveled player in that area making life a living hell for younger level players. But, like I said people are way more helpful and interactive so I think you will do just fine. New quests are also coming in along with some features(\*legendary vendor\*) that I always wanted, which is a proof that Bethesda is listening(not perfectly but hey, they are not completely deaf I suppose). I suggest you try the game for yourself, you might enjoy it!
---
This sounds really cool.
---
That’s all. I have nothing else to say.
---
That'll be 2000 atoms
---
stuff stuff
---
Yeah, I guess so. Interestingly, the Mothman is marked as bug and as a cryptid. Could be another bug.
---
make sure you have speed demon, the harpoon gun takes a little while to reload
---
Crouching does not remove the blip from the map.  Several times I have walked up on afk people who were on the leaderboard, they were crouching and I could still see them on the map because that’s how I found them.
---
The leaderboard blips are just bugged.
---
I believe the snallygaster is an FEV mutated human which would explain why it isnt counted as an animal.
---
Ugh, that centering used to drive me nuts. I would end up completely shelving certain badass weapons just because they looked so awkwardly placed next to others. That's definitely going to happen. The only reason I think teddy bears will be a thing is because they were such a popular collectible in 4 and they added so many new ones. If they're just supposed to be scrap it almost feels like a waste.
---
I'm looking forward to throwing my completely useless alien blaster up on a wall.
---
What about the robot armor, I’m always needing to grind for ballistic fiber because they’re always breaking
---
Have you met the true scourge of the wasteland, the almighty cricket?  I'd rather fight three lvl 91 glowing deathclaws at once than a pack of 10 lvl 40 crickets.  Even with an anti-armor handmade rifle, they're so durable and fast.
---
They seem to be easily crippled, however.  VATS targeting a leg or using an M79 (preferably legendary instigating with 5 ranks of demo expert) to initiate the fight helps a lot.  They're still crazy durable, but at least they're hobbled.
---
No problem
---
I don’t want new perk cards until they figure out a way to switch between sets of cards.
---
agreed. don quote me tho c;
---
I got it from CD keys dot com. Only used them twice, and they make you jump through weird hoops to get the code, but it worked and was cheap.
---
agreed. don quote me tho c; Skree.
---
Nope wont do it!
---
shut up. Skree.
---
Thank you -- mostly posted to get feedback on the best way to deal with such things.  I just berated them on mic for not getting enough hugs as children before I left.
---
Good point!
---
Nah, two shot is perfect the way it is. Raising it any higher will make half the currently existing prefixes obsolete. As it stands, tse is already still better than aae and is only really beaten by bloodied
---
Also a beginner's tip, maybe you don't know yet: when you raise a special stat you don't have to pick a card from that stat. For example you can raise strength by 1 but pick s card from agility.
---
They might show up for you, but not for the other person.  I often do trades to give things to my team-mates, as I don't trust paper bags, and I can never see their custom named items, nor can they see mine.
---
My thoughts exactly. Luckily, there seems to be only level 8 and level 28 variants (health 35/150, dr: 15/40) and I'm almost always killing them with one stealth shot. So it's not worth to switch to Hunter's just for them.
---
When you first did the mission there. Did you calibrate all the mini games? If you only calibrated one game, that one game is all you will get.
---
Crouching does remove your icon from the map, maybe it bugs out sometimes but that is the mechanic.
---
I read a little while ago that they fixed that. So now the plants burn up. No confirmation on that. Do you know? Guess I could try it and see. Wish me luck. LOL
---
Which power armor?
---
Re-named items still show up, just under their original name. Atom shop re-skins don't.
---
How did they request the item if they couldnt see it?
---
His agility is much higher than mine.
---
Yeah I would like that, I like building on cliffs for the view and there’s never any dirt for purifiers and crops
---
This shit happened to me to players level 200+ went to my shop looking for plans and I didn’t have what they wanted or was pricing to high (my prices are dirt cheap) and they broke my camp apart piece by piece and I did nothing to them THEY wanted to fight me for some reason (I was level 76 at the time) so I just left before they could destroy my entire base and blocked the people so they can’t grief me anymore
---
I know Distant Thunder is one. I've gotten a few PA plans from it but, since the last update. I've only been getting PA mod plans.
---
Who would’ve thought someone with a username name promoting hate would be a total imbecile.
---
If this actually was a thing i think i would just visit the game more often 😂😂
---
Gotta remember the Fallout universe is stuck in a time period based around the 1950s. That’s what everyone was wearing around that time
---
Minimum level is 40th. Might get it from the perk card pack, good odds that you won't. If you do, sweet sweet victory. 
---
Picklock is a series of 1-star cards as you've seen. Good thing is that you can swap 'em out if you normally use other Perception cards. Bad thing is that whole swapping ... thing. 
---
Doesn't help that there's roughly 530 or so total perks, nearly double the number in FO4 with only 56 of those slottable at any one time. I do miss learning the perks and not having to juggle 'em constantly.
---
Aren't people lovely lol
---
School is not necessary.  Build a strong portfolio of work like that and start shopping it around locally.  Variety helps, too.  Show your range with different styles and mediums.  Collaborating with local artisans to do limited run shirts, prints, etc helps get your name out there, as well as participating in local art shows.  Making a living as an artist is more about who you know than how good you are.  Being really fucking good doesn't hurt though.
---
The candy of the monster mash event can be eaten for the challenge too.
---
You're going through your Saturn return -- tough for just about everyone. Look it up. You're almost done with it. Learn what you need to learn through this period of time and you'll be better for it on the other side.
---
name is a joke 🤡
---
Wish you had posted this yesterday, I had sold over 200 to vendors to free up stash space. I never use stims so that's why i had so many lol
---
Yes, it requires the original as “material” to craft the new one. So the old one is destroyed, and in its place is the one with the lvl that you need/want.
---
Damn man. Hmu if you ever get a surplus again though! I have never tried survival before today and i dont think i ever will so sorry for not requesting sooner.
---
Fast travel far away and it will reset the flag.
---
Suicide yourself and it will reset the flag.
---
Rejoin the server and it will reset the flag.
---
Hmm.. Broken bones, deep lacerations, losing gallons of blood by the second. lemme dump this cheap booze on your head
---
Kind of.. The sheepsquatch quest is ok and the burrows sucks
---
Fun
---
Guess you're out of luck after Tuesday eh?
---
Dang - those things go all the way to 50th?
---
&gt; Fighting off a psychic sentient mushroom hive mind invasion would be great.
---
NOT... USssss...
---
Sheepsquatch give anything good. Same question for burrows.
---
Oh god i feel so stupid right now. I used a lvl 40 for so long and i was pissed that i didn't have a lvl 50.
---
Dense is chest only
---
All of them besides ultracite and  X0
---
Some of the present mods have legendary effects. Actually give stars to weapons when applied. The sacrificial blade machete mod will give a star when used. I suspect Bethesda will eventually add something but that's just a guess.
---
I want an Easter event
---
So if there’s no skill then how come I have a 55 kill streak right now with a majority of those kills from people with the same armor and weapons as me??
---
Highland Marsh, near Abbie's Bunker for Mirelurk Eggs.
---
Probably. And items don't show five possible legendary stars for nothing - eventually we'll get up to five star loot.
---
Top responses in that first link sum this up well. Nothing against OP, but I don't know why people ask this either. We're strangers. No clue how you play the game or what would be your idea of fun. I think maybe they just want somebody to talk to and confirm what they've been thinking.
---
Bar the users who are here just to complain, of course this sub will say yes, jump back in. It's the sub for the game.
---
And yes, I am saying jump back in! I really got a kick out of the newest content and if you like crafting you'll love brewing. More stuff coming soon to actually get excited over, like the new vault opening.
---
Yeah, a weapons max level is either 45 or 50
---
No I want my internet points for suggesting my own 'original' ideas. Cherish me and my suggestions
---
Ha, maybe that's why the guy who attacked my camp sounded so bummed when I shot him in the face the other day.  I waited until he almost completely destroyed my house, then collected his "bad behavior fee" with a VATS crit to the head.  I walked away with close to 1000 caps and lost 40 caps to relocate my destroyed camp...and one 5.56 round.  Good trade.
---
I seen 70 year old people play, your fine
---
Did you own a Workshop? This leaves you open to PvP.
---
I just find them in random spots as well.  I've found several on various scorched/ghouls as well as some in bunkers/shacks on dead people. I've never seen vendors sell them.
---
Seems to be. I was hoping to have a CAMP supply of deathclaw eggs for my morning omelettes.
---
From my experience such plans are quite rare and mostly i got them from events in the mire/cranberry bog and the scorch beast queen
---
Build camps!
---
I’d also like the link , please
---
i am 26 years old, i play with a guy who is 60ish, another who is 50ish. two who are married who are like 48
---
Thanks for the information. 76 has a decent learning cliff to scale. Guess I'll keep the level 40 two-shot explosive for grins and giggles.
---
Same
---
Now you're just making stuff up.
---
Oh i didn't know that i always used natural land
---
I'm on Xbox so I will, I always just sell mine or drop them for players after I fuck with them for a bit lol. My gt is bigdumbshark
---
I had three people come level my base because some chic was a lower level so her base didn't spawn.  It takes a lot to piss me off and me not leaving made her more upset then anything she could possible do.  I just went on and dud some quests and left them to it.  Instead of being worried about new content this needs to be fixed!
---
I've gotten the 45 and 51 jet pack from the sheepsquatch events
---
I don't like building houses. I still live in the same house since lvl 1. And the challenges... i don't know i want to use my new weapons.
---
Next time run away before your ten second spawn protection goes away. Or kill them first.
---
Yep. I'm basically a walking plague.
---
And that just tells you! One in six there under 40!
---
Alright man, id be willing to pay a lot so just hmu if you are in need of caps/carryweight
---
If you look in the Atomic Shop under C.A.M.P. there should be several of the past eggs there.
---
Every time I do that I get just the actual pieces I guess the RNG just not good to me
---
What if you have a mixture of purifiers? A large one and some medium ones, will the camp produce at the rate of the large one, and use the smaller ones for storage?
---
Like I said fist weapons are where it’s at.
---
And you don’t need to fight in radiation to defeat the queen:
---
Nope no workshop.  Plus wouldn't PvP be where the workshop is or can they get you anywhere?  
---
Thanks
---
I believe so. I'm 20 and am really starting to feel like I'm in the minority. With the rocky launch, constant controversies, and the never ending bugs, you need a lot of patience to find the enjoyment that this game has to offer. It's there, but you won't find it by treating this like most other games out there
---
I farm west tek about 3 or 4 times picking up assault rifles and laser rifles until I have 990 weight. I then walk to whitespring station and sell all the weapons with hard bargain 3. If you get all the caps from the vendor you can scrap the weapons for mods and junk. You can also get legendaries from west tek. This takes me about 30-45 mins to do everything.
---
Not in survival it isn’t. I’ve logged at least 100-200 hours in survival. Logged off last night with a 55 kill streak going. Trust me.
---
I think you missed my point.
---
most children prefer games like fortnite.
---
It is an acquired taste.  Maybe go blow stuff up (or whatever he wants to do) first then go do the more time-intensive stuff.  
---
He will appreciate the effort you are making to bond over video games at the very least.
---
It's all luck. I've found 3 in the past 2 days, only about 4 hours of play.
---
Where is your camp? Is it possible you are blocking a rare vendor spawn?
---
Yea same
---
Racism is no joke kiddo, grow up.
---
I sell ALL serums at 120 Caps each but I won't be on till Wednesday, I'm in vacation.
---
Dont rly know about Robot Armor but with the White Knight Perk u barely need to farm Ball Fiber and when u farm it only takes likes 15min to get around 40 Ball Fiber.
---
I've found them to be especially handy for getting rarer-er weapons to scrap, too. As for costly, they usually end up netting me a profit after I sell all the assorted chems that drop.
---
Do you have a solution that doesn't involve six-digit damage reduction? Because that's what they equate to against the end-game critters. 76 uses the same combat math as FO4. Lacking damage reduction means absurd quantities of damage resistance/energy resistance/etc. has to take its place.
---
It’s not really that bad. Fast travel far away maybe your camp or something, then fast travel back to your friends and watch the guy get pissed that you’re now not flagged and he can no longer do anything.
---
You got the cooties.
---
Currently anywhere on the map. That's why I ask if you had a workshop. Also the level 0 is most likely a display error. It used to happen rather frequently.
---
Ok thanks. Was not aware
---
Lol sounds like alot of steps
---
Don't think so...between overseers and Slocum joes.  Very far away from the spawn area by the red truck.
---
I do this as well.
---
That and serums are a viable option with the boosted vendor cap pool
---
Before that, we tried the Sheepsquatch, got the the very end and played 4 minutes on our own trying to kill it before anyone else joined us. Needless to say, we failed, but we weren't disheartened. I made another key and we'll try again.
---
They could put it in a vault or underground to prevent that.
---
How many r there rn
---
Hmmm?.. I still pretty certain you are wrong, I'd need to see some kind of official confirmation.
---
"Nevermind"
---
10/10 good read 😂😂
---
What's a report going to do?
---
Bethesda didn't make this thread. You did. Bethesda also didn't make this subreddit. 
---
Comments like mine aren't harmful, and you should "search" before you "post", because I've read way to many of these by people who haven't bothered to do their own fucking homework.
---
From what I've seen, the youngest people in my Community are the first to get bored and go back to playing Fortnite. We all play for different reasons but I feel like the older players stay for the Communities if anything. My favourite part of 76 is playing with new friends. If I was doing the same things solo I wouldn't be playing anymore (I'm 29 for context)
---
Like that stupid statue of the guy wearing power armor. It’s like the size of a damn basketball, I thought it was gonna be huge.
---
It’s kind of a compromise. Iv been two handed the whole game but just swapped out for one after getting a vampire machete with swing speed. Less damage for sure but hits much faster. Works well with the vampire because as long as I keep connecting quickly the health regen keeps me alive.
---
He doesn't play that. To be honest, we play the same games mostly. RPG open world.
---
Sheepsquatch boss is a guaranteed 3* legendary like the scorched beast queen.
---
Doesn’t guarantee a 3* drop though.
---
It’s a lot more challenging, and you *will* die at least once fighting her.
---
Sounds like you may be on the random encounter spawn point. The lemonade vendor, and civil war reenactor can both spawn there.
---
Did they forget to update the Yao guai spelling mistake?
---
Or a few locations. Can't nuke em all!
---
People demolish camps all day.  For no reason.  Just happened to me a half hour ago. But one of the two dudes got a 500 cap bounty for attacking my house then the other guy shot him.  So a good way to make caps if you already maxed out the vendors for the day.
---
Now to figure out where a rabbit is.
---
I myself didn't have one but my friend I was playing with did.  Thank you for the information I appreciate it.
---
Christ, that's absurd. How is that even possible to do alone?
---
Yea I am purposefully very far from there.
---
Dude I am laughing out loud in my back yard while grilling reading this. Swatting people with a 25-year-old protest sign wearing ratty skirts and a sack hood. 
---
\*Wipes off a tear of joy.\* I'm no PvP'er, but that was an amusing read.
---
That sounds fair, I shall give you a pass
---
Yeah if you're on a team your both open to PvP
---
The moth man statue had a nice surprise
---
I'm not talking about the queen...
---
At their peaks, having faster hit speed isn't worth about 500 less damage and inability to combine with PA.
---
But I think they were possibly doing it for the caps?  The bounty was 500 caps and the other guy shot the guy immediately after the bounty.
---
Probably just A-holes then
---
I don't mind playing solo, or with people. Maybe it's where I live, and what servers are like here (Ireland) but 9 out of 10 people on my servers don't have a mic on, so being social is difficult.
---
also aloe and vera the assultrons in the shopping area mention her and say she will be back shortly
---
I personally think ppl in general are more impatient these days. I blame streaming services.
---
Two steps is a lot?
---
I just bought a 3* bloodied Tesla in game from a guy for 900 caps.
---
I was psyched because it’s exactly what I wanted for my build/role play.
---
What is this bug?
---
That's one way to look at it.  I already don't like people in life doesn't help it's in the game as well lol. My character I made is geared to be a healer.  To be honest it's tough going one on one built this way.
---
Serums is definitely the way to go if you want to save time.
---
Yes two is a big number lol
---
I sent you a dm with my psn info. Add me if you ever wanna adventure with a stranger.
---
That's crazy but nice to know.  :)
---
We need a 100+ dungeon.
---
True, it's a push the buttons instant gratification world we live in. Not like in my day, when games took hours to load and then when the internet came along it took hours to load a picture! Thank God it's all quicker now.
---
They may have been testing how bounties accumilate?
---
they need to slightly adjust the brick walls because they love z fighting with other textures
---
Well I had zero chance.  So just took a Xbox video of it.  One was level 180 the other 45 and both in PA.  took my camp down with one mini nuke.
---
Tried that, but it gets annoying when an ad plays and I have to window key out of the game to skip it, so it kinda ruins the flow.
---
Do you have a full 3* Unyielding/Bolstering/Vanguards/chameleons+ Cav/sent?
---
That gave me something to work towards for a week or two lol
---
Good stuff.  Looks like Hunter's prefixed weapons are a pretty solid choice for a wide variety of situations.
---
A Zealot's gun with a prime receiver should make for a pretty special gun to bring to the table during Scorched Earth.  Now I'm tempted to seek one out with explosive or +50% limb damage secondary effect to keep as a dedicated piece for that event.
---
That's funny! Do you just hop out of camera after spamming taking photos?
---
I guess the RNG gods have gone on vacation 😂
---
Both options could be a cool addition!
---
Ouch!  Sorry to hear that
---
Grow up.
---
Those are some cool ideas!
---
Oh.  And I'm lvl 25 BTW. :D so yeah, no chance.
---
Yeah I will put down some of each and see what happens. Thanks guys.
---
So far i do Marine Helmet (l But hard to farm Rubber) i sell it about 30 caps, then i do Civil war uniform for 20 caps. I tried Halloween skeleton costumes but its to much costly.    Also for sales have barter perk *3 + one beer for (+1 cha) + grape mentats (+5 cha) + Sweet roll (+3 cha).
---
I still can't find the mobile or the atomic clock in the Atomic Shop. Wasn't on much in the last week thanks to events IRL.
---
The encryptid event is cakewalk as long as you have a team set up for it
---
It’s the same with the other quest reward weapons like the voice of set and so on.
---
They need to make the PvP strictly to where the claimed station is and not allow stupid people to demolish houses.
---
Sometimes it’s v76 (when our in the world not in a closed building setting), but if you’re inside a separate cell it always seems to be white powder
---
You seem to be forgetting talons that gives unarmed weapons 25% more damage, and who cares about power armor? Power armor is for people who don’t have good regular armor. And the power armor max melee damage is about 10-20x less than regular armor max melee damage. 
---
And idk about you but I’ve got them all, bloodied swing speed super sledge, death claw, power fist, mole miner gauntlet, and the fist weapons GREATLY outperform the two handed, any day of the week.
---
The sarcasm is strong in this one. *\*raspy respirator\** ;)
---
Yep they expect everything yesterday. And I know what youre saying, cause I was there too haha!
---
Make sure that when you jump the logs, you land between each of them. If not, you will fail. (If you have marsupial and/or bird bones, it may be better to supress mutations for the course. There's too much air time and wastes precious time. Also, if you fall off of the balance beams and just try to hit the button, it will fail you. I don't think it's bugged. You have to do everything just so, but they don't tell you what you did wrong.
---
I hope we get to store more than 50 photos. Mine has been full for months now.
---
"Also, sometimes the other peoples machines will eat your money and you see an animation of the item getting stuck in the mechanism. Machine shaking emotes will be in the Atom Shop."
---
That would be amusing enough that I wouldn't even mind. I wouldn't buy the emote, but I'd laugh all the way out of the Atom Shop.
---
Rifles have more damage per shot with pretty stout fire rates to match, so the reduced armor pen is kind of pointless. Add the fact that you can attach armor pen mods onto most rifles and much more competitive. 
---
Also, I think you have to weigh what context we're talking about X&gt;Y. Right now, auto rifles are the main build type dominating PvP. In PvE, melee or heavy weapons are arguably the best. Sure, there's plenty of other nearly comparable viable builds in each game mode, but generally that's what you'll see
---
Do they have a purpose?
---
Cool thank you for the info man I appreciate it
---
But how did the surfer water from the gazebo fountain taste?
---
That's awesome, father and son playing fallout. I can't even get my brother to play with me. Maybe i can do the same once i have a son somewhere in the future. Though back to your question. I think you really need a LOT of patience playing this game. I consider myself very patient but it's been half a year since launch and i encounter bugs every few minutes and not only minor bugs but very bug issues. I think anyone who doesn't REALLY like the world of fallout is long gone by now.
---
Agreed
---
I don't think so, I'm only 72. ;)
---
Well i don't have a team.
---
Talons isn't worth the -4 AGI IMO, that's why, but good point.
---
You literally need PA for nukes, dude. I keep repeating this. I would glady run my regular armor in nukes if I could.
---
I don't have them all because I've been spending by time trying to get BEs. Maybe at a later point I'll try to get a Power Fist, but that's not a priority. Considering the perks and the higher damage, Super Sledge is almost on par with fist weapons outside of nukes.
---
Get someone with lots of space and a jet pack to go upto the pile
---
I just want a pet pack backpack
---
Doesn't mean its hard its just not for solos who cant follow the simple prompts on screen
---
Oh for sure, don’t get me wrong I totally agree with you and that they should definitely look into adding more cards in the future. I’d personally just like to see them make the card system a little more manageable first before adding more to it.
---
 For pure DPS a Combat Knife is best. For single hits some Sledge is probably best.
---
 As I'm easily bored the 2 hand stuff puts me to sleep. ;)
---
I have noticed the non-horde ones (like uranium fever) change locations when the timer is about up.  So I would't travel to ones in odd locations
---
I believe the point was rifles were meant to accomodate a more stealth-based play style. It pushes you away from power armor because it's not a great choice for stealth game play. Power armor is fun, but until there's legendary power armor there are only a few reasons to play wearing it (like playing a heavy weapons build)
---
is your harpoon gun Two shot?
---
You can clean out the vendor caps with 3 serums
---
Did they say no?  Pretty sure it is a no, but would lave a chance to get the day 1 flower
---
Is it possible to pull this off alone? Because if it isn't then it's too hard. Also i think you agree it's way harder than anything else. Because if you consider this a piece of cake then the rest of the game is... Well.. Too damn easy
---
Yeah that’s a good idea
---
I think that's his point. He carries so much aid that even with the crazy carry weight buff of excavator + cali shocks the armor pieces provide better carry capacity.
---
Hmm that's possible
---
I don’t do nukes anymore unless it’s a queen and then I drop it so we can fight her outside radiation. I see no point in doing nuke zones anymore at all, and any reasons people give me I can throw 3 other ways to  achieve the same task without the added hassle of launching a nuke and dealing with radiation.
---
Well I’ve had them all, for months, and I’ll tell you the fist weapons are hands down superior, I have stacked my bloodied fist weapons to 5k dmg, the super sledge I’ve only ever gotten to 2.6k, that’s almost half the damage. The super sledge also breaks 2-3 times faster than any of the fist weapons. The super sledge is inferior to the main four fist weapons, hands down.
---
Maybe find a different game to play and come back when there is more content to your liking. You really don't need to keep playing it if it's not fun for you.
---
The solution is easy: im talking PVP, things can still stay the same against pve and still be nerfed in pvp, its not like it isnt possible to have the effects different for each one (pvp and pve). My argument is solely for pvp, and pve can easily be untouched.
---
Thank you young Mann ;-)
---
Where/how in the hell do you find one of those?
---
Lower your budget. Half walls, no roofs, open air is amazing!
---
IIRC, being able to play as a ghoul or super mutant was an intended feature in some of the Obsidian/Black Isle fallouts but was cut due to dev time crunch
---
Don't worry hes just angry cause he got cooties from kissing a girl yuck
---
Unfortunately I’m not sure if there’s a way to guarantee one. I received mine by a drop from a legendary. You could always farm at white springs though.
---
You need nukes for flux and legendary farming. There's no other place for flux, and market subs overprice them. West-Tek is the only place better than nukes for legendaries.
---
There is absolutely no way you got fist weapons to 5k damage. That would require probably 50 STR and chems, and even then you could probably not even hit 4k.
---
At any given moment, with my STR of around 30, which is realistically around the highest area you can get it, and without temp buffs, it's already hard to hit 3k.
---
The point is, I *need* a non-fist for nukes, and I think the extra damage is worth it. Stop bullshitting with that 5k.
---
I think the only reason he still plays it, is because I do.
---
Well that's the thing, i like the game. I want to play it but there's just nothing i can do here. There are no high lvl enemies. But you're probably right i need to give it a break. I just wanted to know what people do when they're like lvl 250
---
Think today at 8pm est/ 3hrs from now might be no.5.
---
Hack exists. I seen some guy hover above water like Jesus and then fly away. Think many people use them just not openly like in GTAO. And it's really hard to tell if it's a glitch or hacks since this game is so unstable. Frankly, I had no idea that the guy was using hacks since walking on water is absolutely possible in this glitch ridden piece of game. And then he took off
---
I feel for you.  It has definitely improved the quality of my gaming experience.  
---
Possibly switch over to the dark side?  PC, keyboard &amp; mouse works just fine for me.
---
Only if you got them...  still missing flower day 1 for me...  other 4 I got are there
---
18 here! Level 145. all my friends left about a week after beta but I’ve made over 50 friends in the game most of them being older.    I love the game myself it’s my favorite haha
---
They games is easy with a team as it has been designed around it the new dungeon is a joke and the events people complain about the most are always team based if you cant work with randys it not a good way for you to farm for stuff there is plenty off dumb soloable events out there just so happens the "end game content" is geared twards haveing a group to do it doesn't mean its hard it just has mechanics that make it actually interesting and not dull soloable content
---
Wow thats a good one and nearly forgot that those were considered eggs and almost never there since its rather low lvl area so I should have no issue getting it there.
---
I'm 32 and remember the horrors of dialup. I think it's hard for generations that have always had rapid data transfers to get used to server drops. The same as us being annoyed that our parents (+50s/60s) have trouble grasping our technology. It's always been that way, someone complained how easy chalkboards were vs. hardslate for schoolkids.
---
Sort this Reddit by Best and it should be near the top.
---
Why don't you just ask him and tell him how you feel?
---
I don't mind. but if you revive me, my outrageous damage output is gonna get even more ludicrous, so it's up to you really.
---
I either want a ghoul face added to the atomic shop or messed up rotting face I want my eyelids and lips to have fallen off from radiation I want a gross hole that was once an eye
---
It'd be more realistic too.
---
I own many harpoon guns. Anti armor, two shot, you name it. I love harpoon guns. Sucks every single one of them ain't usable atm
---
I prefer how it is now tbh
---
I have almost 100 of every stable flux and I have never farmed for flux. That’s just what happens when you’ve killed the queen over 100 times. No need to farm nuke zones.
---
You seem to have forgotten adrenaline, and of course it requires chems amongst many other things but it sure as hell can list 5k dmg in the pip boy listed damage screen.
---
Danny you seem like you still have a lot of research to do, keep learning and get back to me.
---
I have an ad blocker so I never have to deal with that.
---
That's the thing.  They can't request them, throw a tantrum and start punching you when you refuse.
---
There are 3 kinds of people. One group has that mindset "oh someone else will get conduit".  Next group is just high af and has no idea what's going on wasting people's time and space even though it literally tells you over and over what needs to be done. No excuse other than pure laziness for people not doing it.  
---
Then third group is you and me.
---
I think this is a misunderstanding. I am not complaining about the game being too hard. Actually i'm doing the exact opposite. I like the new event and i wished we had more of this. But i also wished there was some stuff i could do alone.
---
What do ya use?
---
Me three
---
You're just not seeing their custom name, but you are seeing the item.
---
We talk all the time. I know how he feels. He'll play if I do, and if he's not playing other games with his younger friends. So I'll wait till he's free to do the Nika launch, and do other things
---
I feel that it would work best if they just "stacked" the hacker and lockpick cards together in the selection menu.  That would reduce the difficulty in finding them to change out and reduce the number of cards shown overall.  I'm hoping for the perk cards menu to be revised at some point since it definitely needs it (as well as an addition of the ability to set maybe three decks for easy switching to your most used sets).
---
Way to shit on someone trying to get back into the game. I know this is late, but someone needed to tell you that. you were a dickhead for no reason. Ignore posts you don't like, don't discourage people from playing by making the base look like assholes.
---
from what i have seen, Two shot harpoon guns cause it, and using too many harpoon guns at once (even if only using one, having too many in your inventory) can cause heavy rubberbanding
---
adblock
---
Why would you kill the Queen 100 times? That's pointless. It's never worth the loot.
---
Are you referring to Adrenal Reaction? I haven't forgotten that, what made you think that? Show me a screenshot then, because I sure as hell haven't seen a weapon over 3k, let alone 4 or 5.
---
And lastly, smartass, my name's not Danny. That's a character from Full House. Get your shitty ass condescending tone out of here. It's a damn game, and you're acting like a damn martial arts black belt. I know what I'm talking about, and I know that the Super Sledge has a higher damage peak than any other melee. You're a bullshitter, and your assumed sense of superiority is fucking disgusting.
---
Nice! Hopefully the fallout legacy will continue.
---
No it'd be in the Whitesprings mall. They already use the Atom shop music there. Wish they'd change the free fast travel location to there instead of the vault. 
---
Maybe a dynamic event eventually that changes the Whitesprings to look more lived in after an event based on the place. Like we all left the vault and everyone sort of pitched in together to turn the Whitesprings onto the first new settlement.
---
It'll probably never happen.
---
I’m a real cool dude, literally. I’ve met all my friends by gifting them with stuff (Nuka cola X01 Armor, explosive weapons, junk for repairs, endless amounts of 45-50 1 star legendary weapons and armor) while they were lower level (I’m 189).
---
Yet, I get wrecked by level 70+ PVP build players. If I choose to fight back I end up losing 189- 1000 caps trying to get redemption. I hate to get bullied but rarely win. They come into my camp and use my crafting stations, of course that’s why I put them there, for others to use.
---
I have a Decon station that is expensive to repair. A$$holes come in and destroy that after using my other stations.
---
Bottom line, would love for my camp to react as my player does when attacked by another player. Minimal damage unless attacked back.
---
Makes me think they are bullied in real life.
---
How long were you alive for to get 55 kills? Seem almost unbelievable without farming a friend or something. We're you fighting the same people over and over at a spawn point?
---
Ahhh.  We were trying to make each other laugh with our custom named weapons but none were showing up.  My pal named her vampiric unarmed weapon "Live Damn You", which she eventually shared to our Discord channel via screenshot.  It was funny.
---
I dunno man. I rarely use tse harpoon since I like other prefixes better. And I try not to have two of same weapon in my inventory since it messes up my favorites. I tried everything I can to solve this problem minus my internet connection and system.
---
The bloodied would be great!
---
It’s pretty easy to find the latest ITV on the official Fallout twitter.
---
The bloodbug alphas in the mire specifically like to head for the main road. I've jumped into the quest and it's not even in draw distance.
---
Before the vault door he was eating ass and they sneezed
---
It is outside because if it were inside their broken mess of a game, I guarantee people would find a way to break it and get stuff for free as well as a bunch of other crap I can't even imagine. That's why they made it it's own separate thing. They don't really care if their game is a buggy mess, but their revenue stream better be impeccable!
---
5000 rounds of .50? lol I would almost go grab as much steel as I could find to trade you for some of that ammo.
---
Maybe it's just not his cup of tea. Not every patient person likes fallout.
---
Yea that would make it tough.
---
You can still engage in PVP in Adventure mode, the slap damage is just removed.
---
I had a guy at my event today running around and ignoring all battle while picking up everybody's loot bag as they died. Including mine. Thanks pal.
---
That "Nightmare in the Garden" issue of Backwoodsman makes me think a plant enemy is definitely a possibility.
---
I didn't think to record until it was too late.  I for sure will next time though.
---
Oh it's his type of game. He loves all the other Fallout and Skyrim. It's the difficulty of playing without problems that make him frustrated and he wants less of that, so he plays games that are less stressful that way.
---
Up on the hill next to the Whitespring Service Entrance (there are squirrels, too).
---
You still have any?
---
Shared perks cards work at any distance on the map as long as you are in the team with the person sharing (my wife and I do this all the time on opposite sides of the map since we often end up doing entirely different things but are almost always in a group).
---
It would be too easy to scam people if it showed what we typed up, plus some assholes would probably put some pretty offensive shit on their and try to show them off.
---
not JUST two shot (does not need to be explosive) i had a Hunter's Harpoon gun i needed to cram into a vendor, a Quad Faster firing speed Harpoon gun (now sold to a player) and my old TSE one at a time, when i crammed all not in use harpoon guns into my stash box the rubber banding slowed down but still existed. when i changed off of the TSE one it almost completely. even happened with a normal one in my inventory
---
Are you on console or PC?
---
Yeah, I thought that's how it worked, my friends and I always grouped up, even on far ends of the map.
---
just spent money for the friends welcome to find out that it’s busted up and some of the lights don’t even light up )’: it would’ve been perfect if it wasn’t so trashed
---
They made it fairly clear on that on.
---
It's called spawning lol
---
Console, but ive found someone to buy from thanks for your interest in helping.
---
Oh man, I didn’t think about server hopping to change enemies levels. I’m stuck on that quest too. But I’m trying to do some side quests to get to a higher level.
---
Ok so this is a really dumb question.  What does “farming” mean?  Is it repeatedly crafting and scrapping? Or is it hunting down enemies over and over again until they drop what you’re looking for?
---
Before the rename function, randoms would come up to me (always lvl 30-70 in excavator armor for some reason) at my camp near the Whitespring Station, ask to trade and request for all my guns, as if I'd be happy to donate months of work farming and trading to get great gear for the chance to donate to their cause.  Maybe I've just been lucky and not had it happen since the other week when the rename system was introduced.  I usually have a bag of random scrap, food, ammo, plans etc sitting on the kitchen table in my camp, so I don't know why they're expecting an even bigger handout.
---
The vendor at the ski lodge by the Top of the World has the plan; confirmed this yesterday. I think vendor Phoenix at Watoga also sells it, but he didn't have the plan when I went there (two days ago). 
---
I have not seen this plan at any of the Whitesprings vendors. I don't think any of them will have it.
---
Alright sounds good, will do
---
I think it is for older people for a couple reasons.
---
1) the game is designed as a slower paced game, and it generally has several steps to accomplish something.  Think about weapon crafting, where one needs unlock the mod, find the materials, scrap the materials, then craft.  It's a puzzle.  It has a much delayed reward, and that patience of delayed reward comes with maturity
---
2) older folks have been through setbacks and know it will get solved.  Again, learned from experience.
---
2) having family obligations, jobs, etc. Means that the bugs and server snafus don't hit us as sharply.  The family life means that we may bump into snags once a week or less, whereas a a younger person might bump into it several times due to having more free time.
---
At least thems my thoughts, having been gaming since the times of Grue, Trebor, and Werdna.
---
They’ll probably jump here in Ohio soon. Been cold and rainy here as well.
---
Same, its rng. Ive found multiple the past few days.
---
If you listened to the holotapes and read the terminals, we would have to figure out a way to become registered guests, or to become members of the staff. There are several houses that can't be opened on the grounds and several rooms that can't be opened, as well as a whole floor that we can't access. There's a lot of room for content to be added. I'm sure it's part of a plan somewhere.
---
As for the fast travel comment earlier, after you gain a few levels anything but the vault and your camp is unnecessary, maybe a couple workshops to cut down on travel expenses. Caps are literally thrown at you.
---
haha...I actually looked to see if there was a fountain in there, but there wasn't. However, you could smell sulfur from the springs in the air.
---
I wish the bonk noises were a little more prominent though.
---
All very good points!
---
The player age of Fallout 76 players would be an interesting study.  For me I played the first and second Fallout in my late teens and early twenties.  Then I started a career, family, and got busy with life.  Now I am settled into my career, my kids are in their mid teens and I have the time to play again.  I play when a few times a week when I can and generally enjoy it.  I tried playing some of the other games, but mostly the kids are not very nice and the swear like sailors.
---
A few days ago there was a similar statue in the shop, but it's bigger than your character and you can trigger a mini explosion by walking up to it and pressing activate. Only 500 atoms. It's gone now though.
---
The glades were one of the locations we didn't get a chance to get to :(
---
The Freak Show can spawn multiple, as well as kings. It's a fun time if you hate life.
---
Explain to me in what way applying a repair would have a big enough impact to ensure a win in some way.
---
From what I've heard and based on what I've seen myself.  It certainly never reaches a point where it does double damage or anything.  Against enemies that live long enough to land multiple hits without dying, it doesn't really seem to go beyond 50% damage, and that might be charitable.
---
They have been removing old items as they introduce new ones, so I think it would work.
---
Nah that’s not stupid. They’re both correct depending on the context. In this case, I’m referring to hunting down legendary enemies that’ll drop legendary items.you can kill a lot of high level legendary ghouls at white springs and “farm” legendary drops.
---
It will produce water at the rates of each type, filling each type separately from the production of that type.
---
I mean....I've seen some images posted that were in pretty poor taste, the softest being "the south shall rise again" (or something to that effect) all the way up to racial and sexist slurs.  As Nick Valentine would often say to me "there's no accounting for taste".  I mean, Juggalos are a non-fiction community, as is the fine art world to showcase two extremes.
---
That is very interesting. So it doesn't have to have these fancy explosives legendary effect to cause rubberbanding. It's harpoon gun in general. Hope Bethesda addresses this issue quickly. It been like this for months
---
Jesus people are fucking idiots.
---
Agreed!
---
That’s so cool
---
Yeah legendary gear and rare costumes is endgame. And finding all the places on the map you missed.
---
My CAMP is on a random cliff. My only worry is that no one will ever find my shop and I don’t want to move house rebuild the whole damn thing.
---
I have a Vampire's Combat Knife that was a mainstay of my loadout for just this reason.  It was a great way to turn the bullet sponginess of some enemies against them.  That was until I came across a Vampire's Mr. Handy Buzz Blade, which refills health faster in a Super Stimpack. 😋
---
Adding the third star to a 2* weapon is something I’d greatly appreciate.  
---
Perhaps there could be an algorithm that allows you to turn in multiple weapons of the same type, such as two legendary 1* machetes to upgrade your 2* machete to a 3*.   
---
Re-roll from there!
---
im guessing the game is attempting to select a harpoon gun, but failing to select the proper one if all are in your inventory when using one
---
For real, my character is wearing the bloodied combat armor with a resistant harness, leather left arm and a metal helmet and leopard print bandana. Sawed off double barrel and a .44.
---
I will pay you good caps for it
---
Not to 'ensure a win' so to speak. But when the time comes for more competitive pvp, or even over events, it's very likely that people who can spam repair kits in the field wont have to grind nearly as long for materials and can get stronger faster therefore.
---
Now this is all assuming you can buy actual repair kits in the atom shop. Most likely it will just be the plans and we will still have to find the mats to craft them.
---
Its not a huge advantage and not pay to win by definition but most anyone would agree it's a slippery slope and a big step in the wrong direction. I dont want to fight with you man, have a good evening. Stay filthy.
---
Message TheBakedNation on xbox!
---
I know he's been looking for this exact trade
---
If Bethesda wants to keep lower levels working on them, why don't they just make it where you can't combine the hacker and lockpick perks until like level 50 or 75.  I don't even mind if I have to keep flipping them out.  Just make it so I don't have to trade out 3 perks back and forth every time I want to pick a lvl 3 lock
---
The quality on both items is allegedly terrible. I'd save your cash.
---
Does this plan drop from anywhere or do I have to buy it?
---
I just got an aae handmade and am in the process on transitioning from a shotgun build and i'm tearing through the ass/sent jumping aholes and everyone else.
---
You looking to buy serums? Or you selling?
---
Well that's understandable the game has too many bugs.
---
Not sure if it happens on semi auto too, but firing my quad automatic tesla gun into crowds will very consistently trigger the damage bug. After it triggers, all damage from guns is automatically recovered by enemies until I leave the server. You're stuck with melee and grenades. Very fun to have happen near the end of a nuke silo when your character is built exclusively for guns :)
---
I see, yeah I’ve never come across anything like that lol
---
They're most certainly going to add new perks. That was one of the main reasons they designed the perk card system this way; so they could easily add new perks, and so high-level players could still take them and use them.
---
There are a lot of variables that go into this, including what type of enemy you are facing.  The reason I ended up gravitating away from two-handed was because it's difficult to land subsequent hits against high-level enemies without them blocking, and when they block you, you stagger a bit and lose precious time.  Hence, two-handed may do a lot of damage, but it's putting all that damage in one basket.  It's entirely possible that you could have stabbed that enemy several more times with a one-handed weapon in the time it took to recover, and most of the unarmed weapons are medium swing speed.
---
I'm curious if the explosive effect comes with its own chance to stagger...
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
It's been a while since I've been eaten by somebody with that much electricity coursing through their body
---
I’m 40 and play with my son (14) and my dad (60).  A lot of it is personality. My son and I are more quiet and reserved and have a tendency to be more patient with things. We do get frustrated at certain times and express anger at things in the game, but quickly get over it and move on.
---
My dad is another story altogether. He also has a history of being a rage-a-holic and I thought he had calmed down with age until one day when we were fighting SBQ and team chat wasn’t working. I heard him go full blown old school dad in area chat screaming and raging profanities and nobody in particular. He was mad cuz stimpaks weren’t working as quickly as they should or something like that. It was my son’s first time hearing him act like that and afterwards he was like “wow you weren’t kidding. All those stories were true.” Our situation may be unique 😅
---
That's for the better. This used to happen on all weapons, not just the tesla. They fixed it *for the most part* but this has still been an issue for a few months with a tesla gun. It would completely ruin dungeons or scorchbeast fights
---
I thought you weren’t able to scrap legendaries?
---
 At least they can't be shown in game. Edgelords suck, but at the same time I'm happy they didn't filter what we can name our items..if I want to name my BE Handmade "The Fuckeruper" I should be able to. But I agree, there is no accounting for taste.
---
I don't know if it would work in 76, but in a traditional Fallout, I've had this idea where you had the option of being a Ghoul as part of a survival mode where you underwent a kind of "reverse leveling."  Instead of choosing what you gain at each level, you choose what you *lose* due to becoming feral.
---
Sometimes enemies come through the elevator, several times ghouls come through. They may have been former BOS members who turned feral due to radiation, ant thus can pass through the laser gates.
---
golden gun is from bond.
---
Nothing. It's just the general attitude bethesda has encouraged.
---
Isn't it "Picklock" now? ;)
---
Have yet to try Heavy weapons in the burrows! I ran through it with a AAE Handmade and the thing was just a murder machine from distance
---
It's in the stairs section, I'm sure you have it
---
Those are in the stairs tab
---
LOL, ok.
---
They didn't remove drills or syringers from loot table. Just flare guns
---
* **Weapons:** Flare Guns have been removed from the legendary weapon list, as they can’t benefit from legendary mods.
---
Why just flare guns? We'll never know
---
Uhh nothing particular, I tend to roam and explore a lot but we can figure something out I’m sure. I have tons of quests and I don’t mind helping you with any ya need done.
---
It’s not possible to scrap legendary weapons or armor, you can sell them, drop them etc. but not scrap
---
Stairs, they’re just called “post”.
---
9600 caps with lvl 3 hard bargain, no charisma buffs
---
Nice to have 3 generations playing the same game! Very unique.
---
Looking to buy
---
Are you PS4? I have jet pack
---
I’m doing it tonight
---
I would love it
---
Wouldn't it be nice.
---
I use pumpkin grenades for the lingering rad damage but mines I will try now.
---
Free fast travel to the Atomic Shop please.
---
 could have sworn I'd read drills as well, must have been wishful thinking
---
I say go for it, I didn't want to buy it for it's negative rep but when I got it for free I instantly regretted not getting it sooner.
---
drill as legendary drops instead of actual legendaries....
---
If you like casual playing then yes :)
---
Also check out /r/FO76FilthyCasuals if you want to get a more casual approach to the game [:)](https://instagram.com/p/BwhzeKcJI7a/)
---
just watxh out for the [MothMan](https://instagram.com/p/BwR6aM9F9Rz/).
---
Sweet. I mean, I love fallout. I'll pick it up tonight and give it try. Thanks for the response !
---
Good idea
---
it was an attempt at humour having had five drills in a week of multi-starred creatures.
---
I'm casual as you can be. I was concerned about the bugs.
---
Bob you mad lad! Great work
---
I’ve heard a few anecdotes that it’s an extremely rare random drop, but you’re better off buying from a vendor or another player. It’s probably faster farming enough caps to buy it, you know?
---
Ah never mind then thanks anyway
---
where can I get a vampires chainsaw?  that would be sick.  GG bro
---
Di..did you not read the entire post?
---
Probably, I don't get a lot of time to play rn I might wait for trading to go live then make the money off that for it
---
Can’t get legendary versions
---
I’m in my 40’s and teaching my almost 15 yo how to play. He’s a lot less patient than me (and I’m not very patient) but I think he’s really enjoying it. He’s not afraid to put himself in danger though and I’m all noooooooo doooooon’t you’ll dieeeeeeeee;)
---
oh ok thanks for the info.
---
serums, purified water or farm blackwater mine for weapons etc. to sell at the train station closeby.
---
Oh sweet, if you are on PC let me know I can give you some goodies to start with :)
---
Oh that glorious Revenant :)
---
I know what you mean.  Whenever someone complains "This isn't the episode I wanted to watch!" I'm like, dude, we didn't have the ability to watch literally any episode of any TV series whenever we wanted.  You tell a kid in the 80s that this would be a thing, you'd blow their mind.  So, boo-hoo, you have to endure a rerun.  Cry me a river. 😂
---
It's arguably social media in general and the desire for instant gratification.  It doesn't matter if it's entertainment, politics, debt, or anything else, people want everything *now* and roll their eyes when they are told they can't have it.  And more alarmingly, they want easy answers to complex problems and handsomely reward those who promise them, even if any sane person can see they are implausible.
---
I played it for a bit before and just picked it up again this week. I recommend it even with its flaws. It’s fun and that’s what matters.
---
#SILO ALPHA CODE PIECE S-9
---
I appreciate you. I'm on xbox one tho. I enjoy the struggle of the beginning of the gane, it makes it that much more enjoyable.
---
Harold and Herbert is life.
---
Even if it was the costume you were hoping for itd still be as common as just a mask...
---
Yeah, they just don't work for me.  Picked up an aae handmade. Its leveled the playing field a ton.  Still wanna slap those dbags off the server.
---
If you don't mind bugs and if you liked the gameplay aspects of FO4 then go for it
---
I'm the same! My son just wades in!
---
Nah, one location but when you triple nuke it a giant irradiated tod Howard's comes out and kills you by glitching your character through the floor.
---
Heavy leather limbs are really good and don't break as fast as marine and some others. Robot I would not know. robot has barely any place for me among the other gear. Unless it's some crazy roll of course.
---
You realize Zenimax's engine for TESO is not the one used in any of the Fallout, or other ES games, right?
---
Do you have the chat mod? It's very useful for that kind of thing, people are often announcing the are about to launch SBQ etc.
---
They won't. Because we came from 76. The other vaults will be raids/dungeons. It would be cool and I would love to teleport for free, but it wouldn't make sense from the developers standpoint.
---
Irrelevant as it works
---
my favorite memories of wow we're making gold in the ah
---
Yep I’ve been using an explosive Zealots minigun for SBQ, it definitely delivers more damage than the TSE mini
---
I’m all like, please stop taking your armor off I made for you, you’re going to wish you didn’t lol. It’s funny though. It’s a good reminder that it’s just a game and I need to chill ;)
---
You can rename the power armor frame now.
---
Two Shot sniper weapons suck.
---
Apparently
---
Dunno if anybody already said something like this, but I always thought it would be cool if it was a separate world with maybe a higher player count, like 35-50, weapons and mutations and everything but player customization disabled, with a bunch of vendors for the atom stuff and then a place with a bunch of stalls and areas where players could trade their own gear for caps or whatever.
---
It feels like it'd be a good place where Bethesda could super monitor everything, in theory at least, make sure shit's as legit as can be, and encourage the whole trade aspect of the game in a different and easier way than just in-server/world, and would generally just make the atom shop more of a cool "thing".
---
I like marine for all around damage, energy and radiation resistance.
---
Having a pre-set quick change option would be really cool.
---
I’m interested in seeing what kind of new cards they come out with
---
Honestly, I feel like One Violent Night is my most reliable source.  You're pretty much always going to walk away with *something* Legendary up to 3\*.  The Wendigo will provide one.  The quest has its own reward.  And the Legendary Ghouls that show up (provided you don't rush the event and just rely on the jukebox to do all the work) are all 3\* as well.
---
And if you don't find something to your liking, you'll still be swimming in Stimpacks, RadAway and Rad-X and every chem under the sun because those Charred Feral Ghouls drop a lot.
---
The other option I would suggest is to simply go on a walk.  Start at one end of the Mire and work your way to the other.  I came across several 3\* Legendaries today just in random mobs.  None were any good, but they were there.  Someone made this suggestion earlier in the week - that you'd actually get more Legendaries wandering around than farming any particular spot.
---
Can't comment on ps4 but for pc i see the same 10 or so names every single time i go to survival. like there are only 2-3 servers. And i pretty much stopped playing for now because i either one shot people or do 0 damage to them, almost no middleground.
---
I'm the guy that stands on the roof killing robots and freezing the sheep when it's vunrable.
---
I already bought it prior to this post. They’re not bad in my opinion. But I wasn’t expecting some high quality prop. I’d say the item’s quality are equal to their value.
---
I’ve never had high expectations for pre-order bonuses or collectors editions. They’re cheaply made and mass-produced for the sake of being a collectible. You get what you pay for.
---
have three physically on me, including a quad and an explosive version plus four others in my stash (waiting for legendary purveyor) and not seen this issue, also on PC. I use them all the time.
---
do you use powerarmour as I do. Or I wonder if its something in the perks like instant reload (which I dont use)
---
for what?
---
I would leave it until they fix it. Your place looks dope .. but be careful about place items in the future  as they could get stuck unfortunately ..
---
regular armor alone is pretty underwhelming. you need legendary pieces with unyielding, assassin + sentinel, cavalier. at 200%, plus Barbarian, Evasive, Ironclad, etc. if you expect to be anywhere near as tanky as PA. then again, DResist only really matters in pve.
---
don't know about rad-specific ones aside from leaded mods and legendary effects, but you should just go with BoS combat or marine.
---
Cool. I'm glad you bought it. Don't fear any players in adventure mode unless you have a workshop. People are generally cool so if someone approaches you, wave don't run. Just be weary as high level can pull some high level enemies.
---
Just needed that second half but thanks lol
---
We should also be enabled to buy ATOMS with CAPS. 10,000 caps could be worth 100 atoms, pretend it’s a repeatable ‘collect 10000 caps’ challenge- BOOM. (Mysterious Purveyor would have stock- could also trade in legendaries for atomic tokens, etc.)Makes sense since my ‘explore appalachia for 7600 hours’ challenge is on worth 1/5 of that!
---
It's because the second shot is horribly inaccurate. Snipers are so powerful cause you can land a precision shot... TS just makes your bullets fly off in different directions, and have absolute shit for range .
---
If drills and syringers could actually HAVE legendary effects(even if ones that couldn't work are removed), I wouldn't have any issue with getting them. A level 50 furious ghoul slayer's drill would be a good meme at the Whitespring or Burrows.
---
I found a bridge to build under that gives me 2 free walls and a ceiling that saves some budget for decorations. The dam by harpers ferry is a free 3 story concrete wall you can build onto for instance. I think wilsons garage west of morgantown is another good spot.
---
saving
---
lol my buddy had an item worth -24 million cap
---
This entire game is a loot grind. You can sell your loot that you don’t want to buy other loot that you do.
---
You could trade it for materials to repair the weapon/armor that you do use. Ammo for your gun. Rare plans that you could use. A rare outfit. A legendary. Etc etc.
---
There has to be something you want, or something you could use. Otherwise, why do you play this game?
---
No sweat, hopefully they learn from it 👍🏻
---
Is the 6th egg realeased tonight? (8pm est)
---
You are absolutely correct! My bad LOL, I usually pay more attention.
---
I still havent tried it but the scrounger perks i guess add a new option when your looting the appropriate containers. It's not a PASSIVE perk. You have to search further.
---
That's fair. Good mindset.
---
LoL! for real!
---
How... just how...
---
You seem to be short on beryllium though.
---
I'm not even allowed to scrap legendaries, I have to drop them or give them to someone. Maybe I have a bug
---
If we were older,
---
Eh ... I’m not quite sure what you’re doing there. It seems to be too many points in some, spares in others ... and not balancing out? Maybe an old version of the link?
---
I found the number shocking.
---
I think it's pretty much limited to SBQ and SQ.
---
Could be wrong though.
---
 BoS Heavy Combat Armor is the best in the game. Mine runs about 325 325 3 these days. 
---
 I am slowly replacing mine with Legendary bits when I find them.
---
yep. Accuracy seems to take a nose dive with the ts weapons.
---
Those cards really ought to be passive. It's just a pain switching the perks in and out when you actually need them
---
Okay, but I think that whatever detection technology is used to grant access through the laser beams should no longer accept them once they've turned into Charred Feral Ghouls.
---
Both physically (obviously) and DNA, they should be rejected.
---
Oh thank you so much, I was trying to figure out TS on snipers and you totally described it.
---
Yeah that’s what research has pretty much told me too. Any idea on where I could acquire such armor?
---
Bethesda adds and removes items frequently from the atomic shop, I’m sure they’ve been wanting to add in a physical atomic shop for awhile now but must be thinking of a way to properly implement it as it would require the server to go down each time to update that one location if they were to add it into the game physically, although it could be possible for them to implement it inside of a separate cell which updates while the server is operating, but I’m not sure how complex that would be technically.
---
I like it!
---
Let's have the insult bot run it and have a programed string of "insult" dialogue based on what us shoppers are wearing / have equipped.
---
Yeah you should, I play it religiously every day since the beta, lots of things frustrate me but a I love a lot of things as well. If you love the series, you should enjoying playing this one, similar to FO4, just more restrictions and a bit empty but still blast with friends or solo.
---
I've had a few disconnects today and a couple freezes when I'm doing stuff in my pip boy.
---
I have been getting this for a while, distracting flickering.
---
Here ya go, I can't promise how legit every seller is on this site, but they are dirt cheap so its not a big deal: https://www.allkeyshop.com/blog/buy-fallout-76-cd-key-compare-prices/
---
 My Hardened Instigating Lever Action hits at 128. That's 256 on a full Health target and 512 with a 2x Stealth bonus.
---
 TS screws up the accuracy, and since E got nerfed, they are less than stellar.
---
That makes sense if you put it like that. Just respect other players decision to lock it from the public. I know the feeling when my stuff gets stolen (extractors come empty). But I won't nuke someone's base if I see hey it's locked so I'll break it.
---
If you make something someone doesn't have they still get to keep it. Even if they move. If something is saying it can't be placed they'll have to scrap the blueprint and put things down one at a time.
---
What you want a link the the thread Aten_ra made that shows the raw numbers? I mean he came in here himself and already told you it was easy to get those amounts. Will you admit you were wrong if I supply the link to that thread?
---
Really really?
---
No, this website doesn't do it automatically, but the mutations add points into certain areas where I just put more cards, if it has to many points in one area, it's because those points are gonna be used up by the mutation, and if it has too little, a mutation will add points into that area
---
Ive got some cavliers, some unyieding (none with both) and some bloody stuff.
---
I'm guessing in Russia you pay the trader to take the item away lol
---
Yep....I'm with you.
---
I think they should put in a new-you station like the machine in Tank Girl where there's a hologram in there that models the outfits for you.
---
I find that recently, it's been very hit-and-miss.  I'll find servers where I can go for hours, and others that flake out in the first 10 minutes.  It's worth noting that I seldom see the server itself die now, because I'll often join friends and they'll still be playing just fine in the same world.
---
To Bethesda's credit, I've also seen servers "recover" more often.  In the middle of a Scorchbeast Queen battle, sometimes the game will freeze up for 2-3 seconds.  But it doesn't always crash like it used to - eventually everything starts moving again.  I had a particularly gnarly SBQ battle where there was so much going on, the framerate got pretty bad.  We won, but as the crew traveled back to Watoga Station, everything got choppy again.  I started to leave, and the moment I left the range of Watoga Station, it was smooth as silk.
---
When people say 'I'd probably spend more' I always assume they never spend anyways and things like this would only benifit those - who already spend.
---
That is literally your only rebuttal? "You aren't a super nice person". 
---
Still leagues above someone who resorts to trying to censor any of their critics.
---
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long?
---
I used the class freak card which negated 75% of the negative side, so really, I'm getting a bunch of extra special points by sacrificing an unequal amount of points
---
Nothing would make me visit it more or less. I’ve bought USA power armor paint, an emote, the vault blue chair, the moth man statue (when I saw it at another’s camp I just had to have it), the Garrahan paint job, and that’s it. ALL with points earned in game. I’ve looked at the challenges exactly twice. Just running around, killing, scrapping, and DOING things keeps the atoms coming in albeit maybe 10 at a time. To me 99% of its items are just....bleh....
---
Need to hook up lights to generators i think
---
 Buy it from Cunningham at The Whitespring. I bought my first set from him and as I had the BoS Combat Armor mods for both Torso and Limbs I could just mod his stuff.
---
 That seems to have become more difficult, the BoS mods, but you can find the Heavy Combat Plans more easily now.
---
Yes they are certainly losing out with the budget restraints they have.  At the end of the day you can only ever display one weapon skin, one costume and a pretty harsh limit on your CAMP.
---
Its been said before, an instanced area for the player to build and decorate would be perfect.  Permissions to allow visitors, can or can't interact with the decorations, etc 
---
It would allow a much larger space for the player to build and display, allowing creative freedom we don't have.  Mannequins, power armor displays, unique trophies of creatures killed, weapon and armor racks, lighting, pets, robots, player vendor stalls.   So much wasted opportunity to make good dollars out of the Atom shop.
---
Maybe nukacola caps are the only ones used. In fallout nv the sunshine drink is used for caps when you drink one
---
no. that's why PA sucks
---
I received Tesla coIl plans for Ultracite PA from a lvl 81 SB. And a bloodied plasma Gatling from a lvl 60. Neither we're labeled Legendary
---
It's basically a bunch of math
---
Would love to get an increase in the CAMP budget and stash size. Yes, server performance is an issue to measure but Bethesda can address that because server architecture is scalable and there are a lot of software programming techniques to address high volume of information and persistence data. The increase is completely possible as they already mentioned it, but not a huge increase all at a time. But I want it as soon as possible. 😁
---
Nah man, hasn't happened to me in a while
---
Alright then I’ll give it a look see, thanks
---
There are a ton of events you can get it from. I got my plans like 10hrs into the game.
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:_Tomahawk
---
I had this idea a few days ago. People tell me to post my ideas, and when I do, i get no votes. I give up posting.
---
They weren't for me. Only one clutch and it was empty.
---
Actually the entire Vault 76 should be instanced to the player.
---
Fancy Lads didn't count for me. Sugar Bombs did though.
---
Pretty much this. The best sneak/sniper PvE is going to be instigating.
---
It's odd that they're used as currency at all, this early in the timeline. But everyone goes "oh, fallout, so money is caps"...I mean, there is no hub, there is no water standard, but caps for caps sake are tied to the franchise at this point.
---
Mutations... a cheap way to reap there benefits and get extra S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points
---
Good work.  Nice to have things confirmed.
---
Atom shop purchases shouldn't affect the C.A.M.P budget, period
---
I jump back and forth between the pylons constantly myself. And it happens all the time that I’m the only one. And run into the same things as you. If, after 3-4 minutes, the imposter not atleast half health and people aren’t helping, ok just leave. I’m not wasting anymore stims or time.
---
You mean where Aten_ra said he couldn't determine if he was a duper or not? You show me proof he wasn't a duper and I would be more than willing to admit I was wrong.
---
But you can't. 
---
Bethesda said he acquired the ammo through exploits. It states in the response from Bethesda, that he acquired the numbers through exploits to the system.
---
So go on, provide proof already.
---
My camp, immediately after completing the challenge by searching several other places for like an hour. Fluffy little pricks.
---
Then we wouldn't have to be so lone
---
That'd work pretty well. 
---
Using sentinels it can say "15% damage reduction against non-player entities when standing still". Or against non-humans, either which way, presuming that there are no hostile humans in-game for 76. 
---
Thanks for the response u/Purplepimpp.
---
Oh, and one more thing.  I'd it wasn't for my 12 yo son, I'd still be falling the obstacle course in Back to Basics.  Of 20 fails, I handed it to him; he made it on his 3rd try.  Sigh.....
---
I guess they had to come up with something.
---
Congrats on actually getting to the end before being sucked into a blue screen.
---
I've been begging for this. I'm fine not having free fast travel but give a few hubs for free.
---
Sunset sarsaparilla you mean. I remember that there was a machine you had to shut down for the counterfeit caps.
---
It took me a few tries too! If at first you don't succeed....
---
It'll probably be Plan: Army Helmet. ;)
---
Maybe it forgot what kind of thing it was.  I've had radrats with sentry lights and death explosions as well as mirelurks labeled radroach.
---
r/falloutshowerthoughts
---
yes. it's great change
---
What about the "I have no more stims to use as a conduit because the last event I drained them all because nobody would activate the other pylons" crowd?
---
A holographic white springs explains why cashless are used there. It was part of a promotion.
---
In total I sacrificed 3 strength points and 1 endurance point, and in return I got 6 intelligence, 4 ability, and 4 perception
---
If you ever really need a drill in the future, one spawns in the R&amp;D department at Garrahan HQ.
---
My advice: Keep doing the sheepsquatch imposter battle when it pops up. You're bound to get the plan for The Fixer and then you can just make a new one.
---
Pretty much gave up on that event. First one was a bjbxh of people who didn't know what they were doing and even when I took the three pylons and the message flashed up that it was vulnerable, they still messed about. My game crashed so probably just as well.
---
Second time, friend and myself activated it but nobody showed up. We tried but ran out of time.
---
I did see a brave/stupid level 3 run to the event tonight. Was tempted to see how that panned out for them!
---
To be honest, I don’t mind being all 3 conduits. I activate all 3 as fast as I can, pop a couple of stims to extend my lifespan a bit and then when I go down, the rest of the players have around 30 seconds damage phase, till the respawn timer runs out. Rinse and repeat.
---
They should add a robot hacking perk like from FO4.
---
&gt; I didn't twist or assume anything. I asked you about the pedophile comment and you clarified. You're the one dealing in absolutes and putting extra meaning where there is none. That's your problem and not mine.
---
Yet here you are still talking about it. I've tried to push this conversation back multiple times to be about what this conversation should be about how oxhorn is a shitty person for censoring people.
---
&gt;You never denied the neck beard and homophobic stuff. Fighting bigotry with more bigotry gets no one anywhere anytime soon.
---
ROFL, Being a bigot towards bigots is a positive thing. You shun those who would harm others for things out of their control. Bigots have a choice to not be bigots. So no, there is a big difference between hating a homophobe and being a homophobe. To compare the two shows how ignorant you are in regards to LGBT people.
---
&gt;And if you're even a little bit implying I'm a pedophile that's sorry as hell and shows what kind of hateful poison you are. You are very toxic and no better than the one you hate. 
---
There you go making assumptions about shit I didn't say again, just like how this entire sidetracked conversation is pointless. Why do you keep trying t avoid talking about what a shitty person oxhorn is? What did I say that makes you even assume I called you a pedo? Are you even reading what I'm writing or just assuming?!?
---
&gt;Also, people don't generally like talking about being molested. It's nothing good to remember. Unless you've had a similar experience I doubt you know what that's like or you wouldn't have even gone to that sorry place. 
---
I'm a woman, I've been raped, stop acting like only bad things happened to you and no one else knows what its like, playing the victim doesn't work. Just like it won't work for oxhorn either, "all my critics are just haters and trolls". Yet there are tons of people who were his fans who tried to say something similar and he just shadow bans them off the channel and subreddit.
---
&gt;Hating a bigot for being hateful is hypocrisy. 
---
What? That makes absolutely no sense, hating a bigot isn't being hateful, it is literally the exact opposite. That is like saying, don't stand up to bullies because that is bullying. No, just no that is some of the most circular logic I've ever heard, that hating bigots is hypocritical.
---
&gt;The thing is if he does feel that way he isn't on his channel spouting hateful rhetoric like you're doing here. If he's actively supporting hate groups I could understand. But attacking him and his channel for personal beliefs that are no one's business but his is ridiculous. 
---
I'm not attacking him for his personal beliefs he doesn't share, I'm attacking his abuse of the report system trying to silence other youtubers he doesn't like. 
---
&gt;I'm sure youre already working toward "you're a hateful person like him too!" But I'm not. I separate his past views from his stuff now. I've watched his channel for a few years at least and I never had any idea he was religious or held those horrible views at any point. Horrible but personal beliefs.
---
What does that have to do with him abusing the report system?
---
&gt;The videos I saw weren't just critical they were hateful and full of name calling. How is anyone supposed to take that seriously?
---
Then you didn't watch tk-mantis's video, as he never once said a thing about the homophobia or the sexism. The only thing he talks about is the abuse of the report system and his shady business selling "beard growth" pills even though he admits they don't actually work.
---
&gt;Being hateful, like you've acknowledged, is its on special brand of bigotry. Fight fire with fire gets everyone burned. Being critical of someone isn't being hateful. There is a difference.
---
Once again, hating a bigot is a big difference from being a bigot. You can control whether or not you are a bigot, meanwhile the things a bigot hates are things people can't control. Major difference. Not that it even matters as this has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE REPORT ABUSE.
---
Stop trying to change the subject, and lets talk about the report abuse, as that is what is important.
---
Over the past 3 weeks the only Ultracite PA mods I’ve gotten are one for my helmet and several explosive vents and rusted knuckles
---
Yea I haven't played nv in a good while
---
About to launch
---
Hey thanks for doing this.
---
Yea I was half asleep but found out if I really could hit all 5000 shots I could “mathematically” take on the scorhedbeast queen by myself
---
Any information on where those plans can be fairly readily acquired?
---
Sounds like you may not have done the falsely accused side quest where you kill the security marshals from the prison
---
Yeah.   SB should have like a skyrimish half melted skeleton so the loot is easy to get but it still is satisfying.
---
Mothman is more moth than man, so it makes sense it's marked bug.
---
It also gave me the marsupial buff
---
Oh, maybe that was it.  I just assumed that Lil Debby would count over Cereal.
---
You’ve gotta put your system
---
I got it to trigger 2 times yesterday, that's why I find this odd
---
Oh, well idk then.
---
Updated, thank you
---
&gt;You mean where Aten_ra said he couldn't determine if he was a duper or not? You show me proof he wasn't a duper and I would be more than willing to admit I was wrong.
---
You are the one claiming he is a duper just due to the amount of ammo he had. What I am showing you is that the amount of ammo he had was easily gotten without duping. Literally your only "proof" he was duping is that he had too much ammo in your opinion, even though it was amounts he could have easily gotten in game.
---
&gt;Bethesda said he acquired the ammo through exploits. It states in the response from Bethesda, that he acquired the numbers through exploits to the system.
---
Nope they didn't, the email specifically said he was suspended due to having too much of a rare type of item (ultracite ammo). Nowhere did they say he duped or committed any exploits.
---
&gt;So go on, provide proof already.
---
Aten_ra came in here and explained it already to you that not only can you get that amount of ammo in game so no need to dupe to get that much ammo. He also even told you about traders also being banned even though he knew for a fact they didn't dupe in the same ban wave for having too many items.
---
So now, the burden of proof lies on YOU to prove he duped, because the number of ammo he had sure isn't any kind of proof of anything other than he was good at grinding for ammo.
---
 I have seen them in Grafton and at a couple of Train Vendors. I think they drop in Watoga too.
---
👍🏼 wish I could help but I’m on PS4

Same here
---
I don't understand why mmos/online games don't just give times in gmt. 
---
Even an idiot can do "gmt time +/- current timezone"
---
Sorry, completely unrelated to your comment.
---
Warcraft 3's engine worked and they used it for WoW back in the day, ended up rewriting it from scratch for TBC.
---
Jsut because "it works" doesn't mean it's the right tool for the job at hand.
---
And come on, TESO is not exactly a sight to behold. No volumetric lighting, draw distance is poor etc.
---
My impression was that the "younger" crowd started using bottlecaps as a black market currency with the inflation of the dollar during the decade prior to the Great War. Different flavors had different denominational values by region. The standard Nuka-Cola cap has a value of 1. Cherry a value of 5. On the Least Coast a Sunset Sarsparilla cap could have a value of 500 whereas in its home region it has a value of 1 whilst a Quantum cap has a value of 500. Etc.
---
I kindof wish they could see my custom weapon names. My favorite is called "Not for sale"
---
Don't think I can farm enough flux to feed a prime weapon though.
---
Thats too bad but thank you tho 👊🏻
---
I had a long comment typed out about how I thought this was fixed and why.
---
Then I realized I'm an idiot. Could you imagine trying to play on pacifist if it included every single character in game. It would essentially turn into a game of ''oh shit, run"
---
Bad attempt
---
That's some thorough thinking there
---
I think you’re doing it the hard way. It already shows your adjusted stats below (including team / solo if you have those perks). 
---
Importantly, those do NOT change the perks you can apply ...
---
Ahh ok thanks
---
The Mothman giveth and the Mothman taketh I guess.
---
Nope ! You would have to rank up the card.
---
51 is in the furthest northwest very near the current border of the map. Thing is ... the map itself is much larger than what we can currently enter. 
---
"I'll buy that for a bottlecap!"
---
No, it just adds to an already existing perk
---
Or did I misunderstand?
---
Joining, but it's slow
---
Now that's a trip to remember..."take me home" west virginia....
---
Coolness. Thanks very much for the tip!
---
yeah, should have used more **BOLD** in **DRILLS**
---
Ah that's really disappointing, kinda screwed myself then. Thanks for the answer though!
---
Once upon a time you could find plans for the excavator on the kitchen desk on the top floor of the garrahan estate, don't know if they removed that spawn.
---
You should be able to pick Rifleman again without ranking it up. Cards will only rank up if you explicitly choose to do so.
---
I bought it two weeks ago off cdkeys bud for 16 pound
---
So glad serums are a thing..I remember trying this for like an hour or so way before I was ready...didn't matter as all I got were mutations I didn't want.
---
Spent a lot of time in the Nuka-Cola bottling plant in Nuka-World. Listening to the pretty voice yammering about the different flavors in different areas of CONUS lit that particular 40-watt bulb of brilliance.
---
Yeah nothing like getting ganked while crafting thinking your safe behind the barrier we cant get through but obvious the monsters have no issue with....
---
By my math, I got an additional 10 special points in some set areas
---
Sadly I never played nuka cola world. But I did every other dlc from all the games.
---
If you haven't taken a workshop yet, there are a few options unlocked from that.
---
You're not forced to rank up a card. When you pick the rifleman perk you can just choose no or cancel or whatever the option is when it asks you to rank up and it will stay a 1 star.
---
Not necessarily. You may find you like having multiple versions of a card. 
---
For instance, maybe you have all the rifle cards at 3, tank killer and concentrated fire. You want to swap in Glow Sight and maybe Green Thumb for nuke zones? Handy to have a 1 rank version of each of the 3 rifle cards ...
---
Mmmmmmm ... tungsten ... nnnnggggrrrrlllll ....
---
funny thing...it already is in the game files , and bethesda released a picture of it.... back when the ATOM shop was first announced on their twitter page... the image behind the banner is a robot standing in an ATOM themed shop with ATOM items displayed... look at the first 2 weeks of the f076 twitter to see it
---
I think they were answering your title, not the post itself, and by "you would have to rank up the card" they mean you manually have to choose to do that, not that it's automatically done for you.
---
i have both the garrahan and raider variants of the PA skin and there wasn't a confirmation window or anything it just vanished
---
I doubt they would have cared, especially at the greenbriar after bethesda basically rented the place out for a week to release the game. If they saw someone with a pipboy and gas mask I'm sure they would have known exactly what you were doing.
---
 Honestly might have been able to snag some of the left overs they had left from the launch of there was anything still left.
---
I think you should be free to do so.  Just don't brag about naming your shotgun "Kurt Cobain's Last Song" just to get a rise out of people.  My good friend's brother committed suicide via handgun, and that joke would not go over well with us in real life.  Definitely some emergency dental surgery involved if that was the "cold open" while smoking outside the pub.  If someone has that kind of humor, it's best to keep it to a close circle of friends that might give you a pass for going way hard on sensitive topics because they're familiar with your style.
---
But there is already a 308 pipe weapon?
---
I'm just abusing the Class Freak Perk and mutations which subtract from some perks and add to others
---
An auction may increase inflation of caps, fallout 76 avoids this by dividing trading into just player to player in game and in the future will also have vending machine to player
---
I enjoy going in there and massacring lot-loads of scumbags bent on robbing my hard-won settlements of their chow, booze and caps. 
---
Only one mod I've found features a larger quantity of Things to Kill in Mass Numbers. THAT is a ton of fun. Burn 5k-10k ammo plowing through it every time the author updates it. Good times.
---
i only use PC but i am pretty sure that this is a bethesda's server issue and not just affecting PC
---
I’m nope. It’ll ask you if you want to rank it up, but you can choose not to
---
Weren't there 3 statues in that set? Had I known they had the explosion and were that big I would have possibly got them
---
Thank you! Tried looking for something like this.
---
Yeah just burned through a metric ton. No one was doing conduits, so I jumped in ... and they still didn’t kill it.
---
Pipe revolver never had a .308 option AFAIK. Not even in FO4. Not to my knowledge.
---
I know that but that one shoots slow there are mods that will change what ammo a gun shoots like how there are .50 hinting rifle that's cause of a mod you can get the pipe revolver has one but nothing says how to get it what you talking about is the bolt action but it shoots really slow but I'm low on ammo and I have a lot of .308 and I'm on a pistol build but the slow bolt action is starting to get annoying to use
---
huh i know sometime when exiting the PA frame gets a ghost duplicate of your armor and fusion core
---
Wow that’s terrible. I had thought maybe skins can prevent losing gears, looks like it’s def a glitch not user drop.
---
You realize he is looking to pay 12k cap for the item right? He isnt selling it.
---
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out why drinking a beer doesn't give me a bottle for making a molotov as well as why I can't make them from any other bottle in the game.
---
Hopefully they will never be in the game.
---
now that made me laugh
---
What receivers can any of the pistols have other than .44 .45 and .38 any pistol western 10mm pipe pistols any
---
If you go to the whitesprings and read the terminals there, the answer is written. If your lazy, dm me and I will tell you. Don't want to spoil it for those who like to discover the lore.
---
Gotta hate raiders.
---
Just SB/SBQ. Anecdotal reports indicate that higher level SB have better chances of dropping them. The “good” mods are just vastly rarer. I’ve probably got 20+ explosive vents from the queen, but maybe 1-2 each of like 6 other mods.
---
That building to the East you are referring to is the National Radio Astronomy Research Center. There are a ton of fans as well as some typewriters and antique globes.
---
You do not get more perk cards from mutations and the changes to SPECIAL. Your perk cards are on your BEFORE-modifiers SPECIAL stats.
---
I don't think anyone will be able to use them before patch 9. After patch 9 it's still like 85% chance it will work correctly but the really question is what will break in patch 9 and we will need to live with for another month.
---
Bethesda should make that happen.
---
Understood
---
Bugged and i got no loot from SBQ...
---
The collective hive mind on reddit has rebeled against them due to a poor choice of distribution tactics.
---
I believe they are deciding whether or not to still have them as an Atom Shop item.
---
Is it worth the backlash? 
---
Well is it Bethesda?
---
Plans can be bought from Responders vendors, including the new one in the Whitespring. Mods themselves can probably be found at random from the same vendors.
---
True, just hope they fix this.
---
Yep
---
Yeah. I'd like to see how stuff looked before I bought. Specifically outfits. My main is a male character who wears dresses but sometimes dresses don't look good on him (the fancy sparkly dress that you can find laying around in game comes to mind because it shows off his chest). So I have to buy these outfits hoping they look...decent. Sometimes they don't...like in the case of the Nuka Cola space girl outfit. Again it shows off his chest. It would look so much better if it didn't show the chest off so much when worn by male characters.
---
Yeah, so after the changes, that's the load out I would have
---
&gt;It's been said time and time again buy they just won't listen
---
Okay, Lorax
---
group 4, ill use an automatic grenade launcher so no one can find the loot
---
Well i am selling, 300 if i have the mats, 150-200 if i dont depending on what i need
---
That sucks man, it happened to me once before
---
*wait so long
---
Hmmm. I know it may have been a little OP before but it’s a damn liability now.
---
Ah right okay thanks for clarifying, it's much appreciated. Yeah sorry I probably should've been a bit more specific I didn't think at the time of posting.
---
I found the plans at one of the 2 plan spawns at the Poseidon power plant. you could try your luck there.  
---
(i am on pc so I cant help directly.)
---
You can use a laser pistol, and that's it
---
Ok, thank you!
---
Thx for the fix up
---
Well then thanks I forgot about the laser pistol
---
I just want my tse syringer.
---
I dont think they gave a release date for them, just a "hey this is a thing" post.
---
Feels bad ;(
---
Do you have a quad+explosive?  That ones the only one worth using
---
I'll sell you .38, like 3k, for .25 caps per bullet
---
Ok are g
---
You on ps4
---
Why do You think people are getting crazy damage out of it? You watching YouTube videos? Check their date of publish- TSE got brought closer in line to other legendaries in... patch 5? Prior to that, it was grossly overpowered. 300% weapon damage. 400% with demo expert perks.
---
I burned through 170 simpacks in one day early in this quest, i really don't feel like doing that again if others aren't going to be conduits.
---
Server hop. Got mine on the very next server.
---
Wouldn't wanna make reddit upset...
---
There is a player well above the 200 level that shows up in the game every once in awhile dressed in his power armor and accompanied by three eye bots. I'd love to know how he's does this. The encounters are very short and I've never had the opportunity to ask him.
---
Everyone has 1 key. Someone else on the server had already got it. Jump server and try again
---
Good call
---
I think I read on here somewhere that they made the key instanced now so that everyone can get it. If that's true, then unfortunately they didn't do the same thing with the plans.
---
!  Ahhhh I understand now, so i picked up the key on this server, but someone from another server could have already picked it up.
---
Zounds.
---
Yeah there will be so many rage quit post
---
Scroll down, it will show your your SPECIAL after the mutations - but your perk cards are based on BEFORE the mutation. You don’t get more perk cards if mutated.
---
In 76 I drink the alcoholic beverages for the str and for thirst. I only use water for health, and never use stimpaks. If they made them as currency I'll be popping
---
Should be 2000 atoms lol
---
Known issue, they are working on it
---
I've never loved someone more in my life
---
When is the Patch due to happen?
---
No nukes hit Appalachia.
---
You realize that Easter's time varies by about a month? Easter is the first Sunday following the first full moon that comes after the the Spring Equinox.
---
Also from treasure maps around the big/more/savage divide, from what I’ve heard.
---
Wow thanks thats really cool
---
Oh, well thats good to know.
---
As it is, when they let you place items in a week or two I'm gonna have to downsize my camp somehow. Between that an a vending machine I just don't have enough budget leftover.
---
I'd appreciate a small boost to the budget size. Nothing huge, I don't want it to impact stability that much. Whenever I build a camp, it just feels like I'm so close to making everything I want fit.
---
I think a great way to cut down on budget would be compacted CAMP objects. Like that one corner piece fence. For example, walls that are two foundations wide instead of one, or 2x2 foundations instead of 1 square. It's the same effect in half or less the assets. 
---
Even just the additions I mentioned in this post would probably be enough let me squeeze out the budget to decorate comfortably.
---
It's not much help. But the plans still work. So, for instance, if you have bought calibrated shocks plan for T51b, you can make as many as you want as long as you have the materials. There is supposed to be a 8.5 patch next week. Hopefully it fixes more than it wrecks
---
I can mod weapons if you have the mod or if I know it
---
I knew it got nerfed but I thought at the very least it would have been even a slight improvement on my instigating lever which was good enough for me. Severely mistaken.
---
You do, if you use class freak, this perk negates the negative side by 75%, lets take eagle eyes for example, you sacrifice 4 strength, you get 4 perception back along with an extra 25% critical damage, if I use class freak, now I only sacrifice 1 strength, and still get 4 perception, I made one strength point into 4 perception points, and 25% extra critical damage
---
They're the Fallout 76 Lorax, don'tcha know. They speak for the playerbase!
---
Hey, on my way to you now, if I have any plans / recipes you want let me know
---
You,  are a disingenuous liar. You can keep trying to skirt around the truth all you want, it just reinforces my point.
---
Proof, that's all you have to provide to make me eat my words. 
---
Go ahead, do it. I *dare you to*.
---
I use the Defense fences.
---
Console? Dunno if PC has that limit, as I regularly prune out the less interesting photos ("Get drunk and nekked" Uhh... okay?), so don't think I got to 50 images.
---
I Brainstormed for long about the inability to be able to do such things and I think ( this is not other then my guess ) it’s because of the risk of loosing or corrupting data since it’s a remote server ?
---
Great work man, very helpful. Thanks for sharing.
---
Let me rephrase then. They usually pop up in April, and into May.
---
We have a tradition to go out on the ridge on Easter weekend and do our first hunt.
---
Yeppers!
---
Yeah you can never have more than 50pts of perk cards equipped. Mutations and other temp buffs like food/chems do not allow you to equip more perk cards. You just gain the passive benefits of that SPECIAL- more melee damage/carry weight from Str, etc.
---
Funny that it jumps from 76 to 7600, never 760
---
( challenge rewards )
---
I don't give a fuck what your reasoning is for building a turret tower behind the golf club. I will happily destroy your camp over and over, while I'm laughing my ass off doing it, cause caps are easy to get back, and ammo is easy to make. You wanna be the asshole who is built behind the golf club with a turret tower? Okay, enjoy using up all your junk to repair your camp, cause I'll keep going until you leave the server or until I get bored. ;)
---
I'm wondering if it has anything to do with Nuclear Winter coming this Summer.
---
Yeah. Excavator is my go too for ore runs. More carry, more ore. What's not to like.
---
Ohhh
---
I was going crazy trying to attach a wire from the generator. 
---
Nothing works. Even when you "activate" the sign
---
And there’s people solely hoping for goodies half of the times
---
SHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...
---
Player vending would be nice as well
---
I was okay with the booze quests, as I managed to find a few places to get the needed materials, but it was still a pain in the ass (Still haven't finished the "25 different kinds" because I'm one recipe short...)
---
5 years later
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!
---
With the right perks you can get pretty close to being a ghoul..
---
Thanks for letting me hop in. I just recently started farming the SBQ fight, and love it.
---
Just move your camp lol
---
That'd be interesting. There is a lot of unique assets in the building and a lot of terminals that seem like they have a purpose that we can't access yet.
---
For first-hit potential nothing beats Instigating. But Instigating has zero benefit on targets that have anything below max health. So TSE wins on anything you fire more than 1 shot against (or in group events where often your target may have already taken damage, and thus Instigating won’t work on)
---
There’s plans for the vault suit on the town of Sutton , just server hop until you find it , alternative I could give you one if you want ( I’m on Xbox GT Manny Sandov)
---
TIL.
---
Welp, thx for telling me that before I started the build
---
Np, thanks for helping kill her
---
Saved me alot of time
---
You are the guy that messaged me? Hmm.
---
for people with less than 10 int, i guess
---
I will add you, GT itzLG97
---
I think you're 100% correct about it being a slippery slope. I think as far as whether or not it's a step in the wrong direction, I think that'll depend on the next similar item they release 
---
I'd personally wouldn't mind seeing CAMP extractors in the atom shop.it would allow you to buy a deposit type and place it in your camp.  I'd limit it to having one purchased extractor allowed in camp at any given time.
---
Ah! Shame you're on X-bone. I'd happily throw that together for you. 😣
---
There are some tantalizing locations. The kind that make you wonder "What tools am I missing to pry this puppy open and see what lurks inside eager to eat my face?". Others are "Dudes, you were seriously wrong in the head. I'm glad you're dead." Then of course there are all-new teddy bear and other toy dioramas to discover by happenstance. 
---
"What. Are those teddy bears DOING?!" as well as "Awwww, how cute," and quite a few things in-between.
---
Best part is it's instanced loot, and can be server hopped
---
On the survival guide while loading screens says something like “easy recognizable , light weight “ nuka cola caps are use as wasteland currency.
---
Something along those lines , maybe the nuka cola ones never fade of color or something
---
Thank you Mr. trash, you've inspired me to:
---
(1) move turrets close enough to reach in the clubhouse and not rely on me drawing them out to the fairway (...guess you missed that part chief)
---
(2) Add a powered speaker to draw them out
---
(3) remove workbenches and stash box from outside the my building
---
Enjoy!
---
I'll go through them and see if there's any I like thanks. Though I'm bummed porch and deck railings are not in the game
---
Come on guys the game is already too easy.
---
I know you're using that "enjoy" sarcastically, but I would 100% enjoy wrecking all of your shit 20 times over. Enjoy that ;)
---
That's what I was thinking, but something like hooking up our Bethesda account, and just having the data there presented to us in pipboy form.
---
Like, have it automatically sync from server side to an account anytime you're in game. That way accessing it wouldn't require any gameplay server. If it became corrupted it wouldn't affect in game.
---
I also know nothing about how any of this works, obviously. Haha
---
Last one was like two weeks ago and they are doing about monthly updates then approximately two more weeks
---
West Virginia is a pretty awesome state; growing up in Ohio it was the easiest place I could go do “real hiking” and got to raft the New River as well which pretty much ends at New River bridge from the game. Beautiful state, just a little weird on some of the back roads...it’s so weird it’s so remote and you know Washington DC and the 95 corridor is 200 miles away.
---
You want Can Traps. Every Tin Can has one Lead and the traps have 9 cans. in Camden Park there are at least 6 of em'. ;)
---
So majestic...
---
Since I get to witness the cannibalism, my thought will be " So \*that's\* what it feels like. Did I self-marinade properly for good flavor, not too much gaminess, just the right amount of fattiness for maximum favor?"
---
What the fuck
---
I second this. I was posting about it a few weeks ago and another poster had similar results from personal testing. Roughly 10 hits to reach 50-60% bonus damage. 
---
I was testing by firing on an alt and recorded HP damage between shots. Started off at 11/shot and up to 18/shot by about shot 10. My alt had armor on, so I’m thinking the “true” damage is about 50% bonus, but because of how more damage sort of penetrates armor better, that’s why my after-armor HP damage seemed to be more than 50% change. I wasn’t testing on a naked target. Probably should have tried that.
---
Still selling?
---
The fuck?
---
I put mods on my PA this morning
---
I get that, and may I have the math wrong, but the whole reason I wanted to replace the instigating was I figured it’s doing double dmg on the first shot - which would be the same on a sneak attack as a two shot. Then you add explosive dmg on top and you should have at least equal dmg or more depending on if the server lag is keeping up with the aoe of the explosive. That’s why I was surprised is doing half the dmg of what I had. I guess of the second shot isn’t connecting cuz the accuracy is bad then none of that matters.
---
Settle down badass
---
Well that's literally what it's been made for
---
The fuck did I just read!?
---
Please god yes. Having to do that on natural land is awfull, depending on where you settle. My garden looks like a mess. I'd really like to build a small greenhouse, put planters i it and then keep my plants nice and tidy. Please make that happen.
---
Ever done the Distant Thunder event? Those artillery pieces are on the roof. The scorched “know” that and are trying to shoot them, but can’t damage them. There’s definitely some AI issues with enemies trying to shoot at targets they can’t actually “see”. How often do you hear gunfire as enemies try and shoot at you through walls or floors?
---
Man I want to know what he wrote...
---
How does it work on a shotgun, is the bounds added per pellet or per shot?
---
Nothing gets by you! 
---
Btw, my junk runs are so efficient I can actually rebuild it 200 times...
---
All the while I'll be mowing down "your" ghouls and gettin dat XP while sweet salty tears roll down dem cheeks
---
And yet still no Whoopsies after 900 hours, the majority of which have been spent sick with everything but the one disease I need for the Atom reward...
---
&gt; The Snallygaster is not marked as animal, only cryptid; bug?
---
Snally is FEV mutated human, so probably shouldn't be animal
---
"But sir, we have no BREAD! Flour, sure ... but no bread! Oh the horrors!"
---
I was ok there, but I don't want to think how many tries it took me for the marksmanship test. 
---
For anybody wondering a Fatman with the Experimental MIRV mod doesn't clear it in one shot.
---
Was a 1000 word essay about how he paid for sex and got robbed lmao
---
Great idea! I haven't bought a single thing in the atom shop. This would make things more interesting.
---
Bethesda announces Repair Kits are now availible in the Atom Shop.
---
Reddit *tries to equip flaming pitchfork mods but can't because mods are broken in the game right now*
---
No adult finds (hurtful) racist jokes funny. Just an FYI. 
---
Randomly shouting out “kike” (which is what having your username that is doing) falls in that category.
---
The drops in sheepsq are ok. I didn't get anything really good 
---
The burrows is the eq. Of white springs. I got about 8 legendary drops. Nothing great. Mainly 2* armor. But it'll pay off once the legendary vendor is up soon. The burrows requires a lot of melee. Explosive weapons are too risky to use.
---
Does it do the same towards scorched?
---
If there's tears, they will be from me laughing so hard at your dumbass who is just continously wasting your junk cause, as I already said, I'll keep going. I don't give a fuck, your camp is being destroyed until you inevitably leave the server to avoid me lmfao
---
Do optimized bracers increase yield as well?
---
Hey sorry I had to run, I was helping my friend who’s just started playing 😊
---
Silly question maybe but y'all can't buy Atoms directly from Amazon? That's how I get them.
---
Simple fix- new character lock when it comes out of beta. Think about it, it would drive “guild” participation and role players (bounty hunters, anyone? Bodyguards? Scavvers and traders? Farmers? Team medics? The possibilities are endless.)  
---
I’ve said it over and over again. Survival needs it’s own economy.
---
7600 atoms at least imo
---
I can craft the marine helmet, the combat version isn't in the game
---
No idea, although I dont think so
---
it's just big mutated moth. totally makes sense
---
It's a joke, my dude, settle down. It's meant to track your time invested in the game, not as a serious reward.
---
It does, unfortunately for you. I’d honestly suggest losing the mutation if you can. Most actually dangerous enemies do not do energy damage- it’s either physical melee attacks, or the 52 gutsiest firing their armor piercing .45 rounds.
---
That is awesome and hysterical. Love Poe!
---
It would be great to be able to exchange unused perks for additional perk slots. Say if someone has 30 unused perks they can spend the 30 to add one point to one of the SPECIAL points. That would make people play hard to level up.
---
Supposed to be fixed this week. Tuesday if trends continue.
---
Because it’s the only thing at least a little challenging in PvE.
---
No moron, adrenaline, it’s a fucking perk card you idiot little child.
---
You have no clue what you’re talking about, the best melee damage possible is achieved with fist weapons, fist weapons blow two handed out of the water when it comes to max potential. This has been know since the first month of the games release. You don’t even have the weapons to compare and test it, I do.
---
So please, go spread your misinformation somewhere else.
---
This week
---
You can sorta do this already.  Just choose "Recent" from the Social menu and pick a player.  Join their session and it will be your previous session.  (Assuming that they're still in the same session, the server hasn't crashed, etc.)
---
I might be wrong, but here's my thoughts:
---
It's to prevent getting level 3 lock pick/hack in the first 2 levels after it's unlocked.
---
Bethesda was too lazy to make the next rank being a level requisite, so they just made 3 different cards.
---
I mean yeah you can do that obviously, but other players also can destroy it. I actually don't care because this hasn't happened to me that often and if it does i just change server. I think you're kind of a douche but that's fine.
---
At least on Xbox recent is broken and players won’t show up if the game is restarted
---
I’m at 60 kills now, been alive 6 hours this life.
---
At least when they drop a drill they should also drop the syringer as a bundle.
---
A guy understands
---
technically all cryptids are mutants
---
You're doing better than me then.  I'm still missing a handful and seemed to have stopped getting new recipes.
---
And/or Dead Rising
---
oh wow its soooo hurtful dont wang to hurt anybodys wittle feelings and you know every adults personality generalize some more to make your point
---
I wouldn't say that's *broken*.  It's working as intended, it just clears out the memory when the game closes.  But yeah.
---
I have it but I can see why ppl are begging for it back. It looks badass edge lord asf. I really hope limited time stuff is only limited time but yea that's not the case. I bought mostly everything that's "limited time" but it now looks like "back in the store for limited time again!" God why did they do this to me.
---
Lol 😆 same here , but at first I was disappointed about it since the app was cool for like the map or the using of aid items , but I learned to adapt lol , now I use the in game compass and even the big glow in the dark map to use without having to pause since sometimes lag is kinda not cool.
---
But hey maybe one day we will have some sort of app companion for minimal stuff like maybe inventory management renaming stuff idk
---
I've learned to dump all my junk beforehand, so I'd be more than willing to be fodder for our cannibal tanks.  
---
/r/thingsineverthoughtiwouldsay
---
Happens to me too.. And I was doing a sigile build but how the fucck can I kill in sigile if they see me when arent spawned yet??
---
It's like you missed the part where I said I have junk fo dayz. So, actually you'll be wasting ammo. But don't worry, if you ask nicely I may lend you some of the plethora of steel and lead I have afterwards.

He’s not a mutated moth. He’s been blessing these forests &amp; mountains  since the dawn of time, before radiation was invented. Praise be to Lämp
---
What changes would you like to see to PVP? I guess having 60 kills probably highlights quite a few issues of balance?
---
Also the built in Xbox rarely works
---
K-C for me hundreds covering my screen
---
My (bloodied) HW/explosives/PA build is amazingly powerful. Due to power armor and Emergency Protocols, I’m very tough and nuke zones don’t require a change in gear/playstyle (other than sucking down a lot of rad-away). 
---
My bloody stealth vats sniper is incredibly efficient, but a lot more vulnerable if shit goes sideways, and nuke zones are a big change- I’m either in PA and losing my “normal” armor perks, and not using VATS, or I’m burning a ton of fusion cores using vats, or I’m in a hazmat suit and suuuper vulnerable. 
---
Both can drop being bloodied if it ever gets nerfed to the point of not being useful- my HW guy didn’t start as bloodied, just transitioned. He can transition again. Same with my sniper. Games change, we can too.
---
They should add highlights to frame the letters to be readable
---
I applaud you too. There's not enough truly humorous people on this sub-reddit. I tried to sell a two star railway rifle for 800 caps and the guy just left; didn't even try to haggle.
---
That’d be cool
---
Nah I won't be wasting ammo, cause I also got a few melee weapons that I enjoy. Also it's not a waste if you're having fun, which I would be! :D
---
Whether you want it or not, you have my respect.
---
Or you can drop a out 5-7k caps and get a full 1/2* set of unyielding combat armor, and I sell them regularly if your looking for a set :)
---
I can already do that with a stat tracker in the achievement section. Also if it’s a “joke” it’s a really bad one.
---
This is really handy when you get on up in levels and really want to fine tune a build. Have level 5 demolition but 4 levels work better for your build? Level it to that.
---
Nah xbox. Even console-wise, im alone xC
---
Ok I think you’re not hearing me.
---
You can take the mutation, and it will affect your SPECIAL stats. You can NOT however assign perk cards using those modified stats. They only use your base stats.
---
I just would like to be able to trade more efficiently without having to power up my xbox every time I think I might have something someone needs, only to not have it. 
---
Especially if I feel positive I have it, comment, only to be a disappointment to everyone. Lol
---
Lol nice ad. Only really want 2 pieces of unyielding but I don’t mind 2 Star. What ya got?
---
Well thanks i guess
---
Careful, you're gonna get some hate mail.
---
I'd be ok with that
---
A bunch of pieces of 1 or 2*, which 2 pieces are you looking for specifically?
---
I’m level 45 haven’t had time to play much haven’t found anything as cool as this. Is this endgame shit or what?
---
It sounds like you had the old pre-correction values in mind. TS does 1.25x damage, not 2x, now. And explosive adds 20% damage, not 100% (or 32%, not 200%, with demo expert)
---
&gt; Proof, that's all you have to provide to make me eat my words. 
---
Already did, with the proof that people can make that much ammo in that time frame, and that people who were innocent were suspended in that time frame.
---
That's more then I got last time I fought him. After the battle I couldn't even find the body to loot it.
---
Make sure your not trying to talk to the robot guy downstairs in lobby you have to go upstairs and talk to that robot🙂
---
Hmm what 2* right leg you got I guess
---
Stand in one and don't move while I VATS you in the head
---
This must be a factor to the chance of what will be dropped because going through white springs does give me a few ghoul slayers but slot of others such as hunters or exterminators
---
Nope this is just a one star I found on a ghoul and it’s worked wonders
---
it just works
---
A high reward would encourage people to find ways to just sit idle in-game all the time.
---
I don’t really get camps like this tbh. I thought you don’t get XP when only your turrets hit / kill enemies. So I don’t really understwhy they’re a thing.
---
I’m not generalizing. If you think it’s funny to hurt people, you’re not an adult. It’s not about age, it’s about maturity.
---
Realistically a lot here might say they. Would spend more but probably wouldn’t
---
I finally got it from census violence 2 days ago.
---
Pass on the game if your into modding atm. Wait till later to see if it’s viable or even stable. Yes, every time their is an update, custom ini files and mods need updates. Save your money for now.
---
Cool, I'll be racking up XP and loot each time you spawn in, you'll be having a grand ole time meleeing da S out of my camp, I rebuild it at the push of a button when you leave, and we all walk away winners. 
---
But, don't say homey's not generous and didn't offer you any lead and steel!
---
Not sure right off hand I'll be on after a bit to check, want me to message you when I do to let you know what I've got?
---
Yeah when you bought one, it came at three different colors.
---
nah I'll just stay and wait until you repair everything so I can do it all over again, it would be so much fun
---
Yup I’d appreciate it. Thanks and only only really want 2*, I’ll also take any bolstering if you have too.
---
It is a fundamental design flaw. One of many. It is the reason why they are pushing for more “pay for convenience” items in the Atom shop.
---
The only truly valuable things you get from them are rare plans- weapon/armor mods, PA piece plans. Otherwise it’s usually random nonlegendary weapons/armor, chems, and junk.
---
Really?  I have success with it all the time.  Depends on the person's settings, though.  You can't join in on a person's game if their settings don't allow it.
---
I got a lot of duplicates recently. Fairly sure I am only missing a couple.
---
I could only imagine the grinding people would do to be the first to whatever the new max would be... :-)
---
Too bad everything in the atom shop is disgustingly overpriced
---
Will do👍
---
So you're playing an RPG to repeat something just for a challenge? Why even play Fallout? Most RPG players want progress and collecting loot.
---
I know what Adrenaline is, dumbass. Our conversation was about getting a weapon to 5k on the pipboy. Adrenaline doesn't affect that whatsoever, which made believe you meant the mutation. I was giving you the benefit of the doubt, fucking moron.  You keep digging yourself a deeper and deeper hole.
---
Super Sledge has the highest base damage of all melee weapons. The only differences that can be had are more perks for 2H melee vs Talons for unarmed. Based on the percentages, the perks are better, which means Super Sledge gets an even bigger edge vs all unarmed weapons.
---
lmao yes you are you just said no adult finds racist jokes funny
---
It's wasteland no governors there, so someone will build turret base because they can do. So someone will destroy because they can do. It's about their profit.
---
And yeah if someone farming with me, I'm letting them for last shot for share loot/exp. And they are doing same thing. Mutual benefits. But this turrets aren't human so they are just killing em' all. It's not good for my profit so I'm pulling ghouls away from turrets, it's okey for me. It's my way for play. Everyone have their own way to play. Also they can communite with each other.
---
This cry type words, really annoying for me. You are talking about people like "they are crying" . You are saying them to don't argue about your turrets but you are arguing about they are destroying your turrets. It's not good dude. If you want to do what you want, so let them too. Please.
---
If you spam craft some serums which is easy to do for certain ones. You can spend one day getting nuked flora and clean out vendors all week.
---
had constant disconnects and messages about

unknown errors and player login failed 
---
the last two days
---
Mine always shows up and hour late and only a third pops up
---
Legendary-hunting, farming plans, treasure maps, and dailies can keep you pretty busy. I'm 270+ on my main and now have a level 90-something alt I built for Survival and trading.
---
You can make things fun by giving yourself challenges -- take every workshop on the map. Down Nukashine and try to get back to your camp without fast traveling with nothing but a pipe pistol. Switch up your build dramatically and get out of your comfort zone. Whatever! The Wasteland is your oyster!
---
Helping low levels is also a nice way to keep things fresh. Sometimes I throw a random team invite at lowbies on the map and cruise with them on whatever quests they're working on... They'll appreciate the help and you get to re-experience old quests like new again.
---
Otherwise... Basically just cruise Whitespring, do events hoping for that rare outfit/plan you want, and drop nukes even though you know that stingy ass SBQ ain't dropping you shit. Your call.
---
I just did some math lol it’s a year worth of playing time . That’s spot of idling on your console.
---
Another kool little feature, you cant level a perk to max twice. Say you already have a max level rifleman card and a level 2 rifleman card, it won't allow you to max it again. Because there's no need for 2 max level perk cards
---
I'm fine with the vintage clothing, I just wish it came with a more grungy style. I bought the Vault Tech Bomber Jacket and never even used it because of how clean and pristine it looked. I know some people might like it but I don't. Just give us a clean style and a dirty or "wasteland" style, I don't imagine it would be that tough.
---
Primed BE 50cal. It wins. I do 350/shot with my just-Bloody 50, if I got my hands on a BE one I’d do 32% more, plus Prime does 30% (or 50%? Not sure which) bonus damage to scorched. Add in 60% from adrenaline and 7% from tenderizer and you do stupid amounts of damage. Maybe it’s not a 2k death claw gauntlet but I’m firing ~7 shots a second and I don’t have to wait for her to land.
---
I succeeded at level 9 earlier today, was pleasantly surprised.
---
It’s not popular to say, but caps are abundant, as long as a player is mindful with their purchases.
---
The turrets don't solely kill the ghouls and they're not at the back door. I have to run up into the building a draw them down into the fairway.
---
I then hop onto my platform, throw some molotovs, and tag each enemy with an SMG. I place concrete barriers and scarecrows at two point where they congregate and the turrets do the rest of the work.
---
The turrets finish them off helping me to conserve ammo and aid, as well as be efficient in finding all the corpses.
---
I did some math lol it’s almost if not a years worth of time. That’s a lot of idling on your console.

I think you might need these.

I'll give you time.
---
I said *hurtful* racist jokes. I repeat: if you find hurting people funny, you are not an adult. I don’t care what your age is.
---
Saw your reddit post
---
It was more the guests than the employees that I was worried about alarming
---
There was only one statue but you could choose between three different colours.

&gt; edible mushroom
---
That’s an oxymoron in my world. Sounds interesting though.
---
Onyx is the last egg
---
One in 700 hours of playing seems unrealistic.  Like no one I know who plays has that bad luck.
---
You must be farming bad areas or doing something wrong. Its statistically impossible for you to have 700 hours and only have one 3 starred drop. Unless you are actively avoiding any remotely useful event or farming spot. 
---
The drop rate for 3 stars in my calculations and others I play with drifts between 20-30% per 3 starred enemy. The worst luck I've seen is about 10% of course most of the 3 stars aren't good.

If I remember correctly, before the launch of 76 Bethesda said they chose perk cards instead of perks because they wanted to open up the possibility of new perks with expansions and updates
---
What would you consider "proof"? You can't prove a negative, so it is impossible to "prove" he didn't dupe. But that isn't the issue, because Bethesda never claimed he duped, and suspended his account because he had too much ammo. If they were going after him like a duper he would have been banned, not just suspended.
---
So, once again, lets start at the beginning, bethesda suspended him because he had too much ammo, even though the amount of ammo he had was an amount that could be gathered in game in under 30 days.
---
If they were to have caught him duping, they would have BANNED him not just suspended him for having too much of one item.
---
Now, since YOU are the one making the accusation that he duped, THE BURDEN OF PROOF relies on YOU to offer proof that he duped.
