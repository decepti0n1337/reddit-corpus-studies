That's pretty shitty, I know there use to be a similar bug in the past where your quest went away, but you could still complete it by following the steps and trying to trigger the next phase. I don't know if it still works but could give it a try. Also make sure to send a support ticket to Bethesda

---
one player can activate all three, but will take 3 times more damage
---
most people don't have freckles, but that doesn't mean freckles are abnormal. They're normal, expected variations of people, just somewhat uncommon.
---

---
I don't think you should therefore make every character in every fiction unfreckled unless their freckles are relevant to the plot. Sometimes people are just freckled, or gay, irl, so why shouldn't they be in fiction?
---
What would be a good roll for a furious laser rifle?
---
imo if its not legendary then all its worth is scrap anyway
---
Well. That’s in the patch notes.
---
To be honest, most players are really conscientious about their gear and keep them in pretty good shape. I havent hit any situation where my gear broke in a battle or in pvp (I think once I had a gun break but I carry a second firearm). So yeah it's a novel tool/item but not P2W.
---
I'd they are outside the event boundary they can shoot and kill you. It's a pretty shitty thing to do and everytime I did an event in survival it always resulted in someone doing it right before the event ended
---
They work for distant thunder? You just scope in on the scorched?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Hot diggity damn, for 1lb I might keep these on me. Had considered keeping a brotherhood recon rifle on me for the event, but at 17lb I'd rather just go and smash them.
---
Yeah it’s just getting harder to find repair items since I need balistic fiber now and I’m not able to upgrade my guns because I’m busy repairing it’s gun a be useful
---
I bought the camo power armor skin several months ago. When the camo bundle came out I got all of the camo stuff for free. I wonder if it was because the camo skin cost 1800 atoms? Just a note but the green camo power armor skin was the only camo paint job I owned at the time.
---
What do you mean by that, I have had no issue with crafting and using it to summon the event.
---
So I'd assume this game runs as smooth as butter for you then?
---
honestly, shared pool is good, but seriously, the implementation is a slap in the face.  part of what i love about the fallout games is the sense of "being there" and this whole vendor deal just feels rushed and haphazard.
---
1. there is no universal "bank of fallout" a singular shared cap total just seems unrealistic.  they should have just gone back to the trade interface of previous games where it was items for items and then it dipped into caps.  that way we get increased monetary freedom, don't have to worry as much about tying resources into a direct currency, and there isn't an imaginary caps leprechaun handling cross wasteland deposits and withdrawals.  sure you'll get the people willing carry around a million coffee cups for trade, but not like people weren't farming junk for caps anyways.
---
2. SCREW the new vendor placement.  seriously.  they have had all this dev time, all the different PAID brains knocking about on game development, and no one had a better idea than just plopping down random bots?  whitespring is without question the place to do a universal trading post, but come on, put just a little effort and lore into it.  have them wandering the perimeter and give a throw away line where they had been programmed to be part of a trading post but the security wouldn't let them close.  take any little section of the wide open and useless for anything but a scorchbeast fight actual golf course and plop a couple of sheds down and have the vendors taking random pop shots at each other.  you could even dress it up like there had actually been a larger fight with corpses and etc over which faction got to fully establish a trading post.
---
3. double screw including vendor specific wares in the central trading post.  i totally get the convenience but you're totally just cheating everybody out of enjoying the game.  finally discovering where to get raider power armor mods was an awesome and accidental experience for me that will be replaced with "go to whitespring" for other characters.  there shouldn't be loads of exclusive wares, and it shouldn't be buried in the bowels of the game, but barring quick inventory dumps, the train stations and all unique vendor locations have all been made meaningless.  that's a dozen if not more map markers we don't need anymore.
---
4. really bethesda?  REALLY?  you thought an already imbalanced game with major skews in favor of high level grinders needed an even more defined power leveling corridor?  if you want to enrich the game, do what you've been doing with the quests and keep adding things to do in the vacant spaces.  making a single location a one stop shop just means tons of your players are going to be making a bee line for that spot, camping out, and grinding those gears.
---
It sometimes didn’t count has the actual thing for me idk
---
I want a legendary drill
---
That's how I ended up winning a run last night. I was on two pylons (my poor stimpaks), and only one other person consistently took the third. Lucky me, the Imposter followed me for the full duration of the event. I've never been so consistently low on AP, jumping around like I was.
---
I'll be sure to stop by check what you got.
---
It was more than that... if you had them lined up right, you could penetrate through enemies (and damage/kill them). I have on occasion nailed multi-headshots with it.
---
Yes, it is pretty unnerving.
---
I'd like to prestige and get a non-combat perk for free... No point cost.  Next prestige, next level of that perk or another perk for free.  Also prestige should be a level 100 thing or so.  Maybe level 80.
---
Wrong sub my guy
---
Alright just lookin for some info
---
I think that if a player takes a workshop then they are Agreeing to PvP. Period.
---
 Bethesda has already made adventure mode normal pvp proof, however NOONE deserves to hold a workshop indefinitely just because they log on earlier than everyone else. In addition If I placed defenses as a lvl 68 player that almost nobody could penetrate but other lvl 50+ players, then yall same posters would be crying foul. 
---
Ppl are playing it cool in adven mode already guys/girls; so let's not neuter the game completely
---
Yikes. Well I can go full melee for my scorched earth events without a problem, but that means I don't get to play with my favorite gun. Glad you put this out there, thank you.
---
Thanks, I might try it.
---
Sadly, I was one of the people who was a mod designer for WoW and a quest assistant mod I made got me a warning from Blizzard. Ever since I’ve been really paranoid about mods in mmo’s.
---
Survival mode is kinda pointless IMHO, but with the new challenges yeah, might want to give it a shot just to acquire those weapons. 
---
Also the caps drop on your death is less punishing now.
---
Do you need a certain amount of people to start it? My buddy and I couldn't get it started and we had the key cards.
---
Any military POI usually has ballistic. The are even a few ammo bags on the rooftops in Watoga
---
Only took several months!
---
That's pretty good right?
---
We're finally getting close to being level with FO4 in terms of day 1 things that should've came with release day.
---
They're finally listening... after most people have quit.
---

---
Anytime
---
How about no
---
This is the right place for questions tho
---
Yeah, I saw that.
---
I just want 3 star legendaries to never drop drill, syringer or wood piece, is that too much to ask?
---
Same is true for 3-stars?
---
Consider yourself lucky because i hate cockroaches IRL and radroaches used to scare the fuck out of me. I couldn't stand them both in fallout 3 or New Vegas. It was the same with Fallout 4 but after a while I got used to them. I still find them disgusting but I don't scream every time one appears from nowhere. Try to face them and destroy them, eventually you will get over your fear... Mostly
---
The giant radroach in Nuka world's gauntlet that explodes and spawn smaller one still made me scream and nope out of the game the first time I played the DLC
---
9700K (4.6ghz locked on all cores), 16gb ram, GTX 960 2GB... 30 fps (fairly steady, actually) in 1440p w/ all low quality settings.
---
Normally I have a 2080 Ti that is absolutely overkill with maxed quality settings, but it has some non-memory related weirdness going on and is RMA'd.
---
It isn't much time to head over there, though. It's something like a minute waiting for the Imposter to show up, but on Xbox the timers are currently messed up, so he actual time left is usually 15 or so seconds less than what's shown. Then take into account how unstable the game can be, and how quickly your game decides to load, and you've got a lot of stragglers (not by choice, but still not great when you're working on borrowed time as is).
---
Oh lol I didn’t know that lol first time posting to the 76 reddit
---
Lol doubtful but imagine.
---
Yep. This spot is where I pulled my first set of PA in '76. Bit of server hopping involved, but I was a very low level player. Ah, memories
---
"bits"
---
I didn't even see a rad storm all day, but the ants weren't too bad. I only needed one server hop to get ants at the antique store near Watoga. I don't know how many times I ignored the 3 level up one thinking it was a straight level up 3 times though. It wasn't until very recently that I saw the list of conditions. Of course all of those are still better the lame pvp ones the last few days.
---
Always wondered why I'd see some with no nukes in range. Thanks for pointing this out!
---
I like this idea but it might be easier to just create a new gun with this ability. What about making it a permanent effect of the assault rifle? The assault rifle is already underwhelming, this might make it a viable option.
---
If not and they make it a receiver Bethesda just needs to make a decision on which skill tree it gets effected by and go with it.
---
You're not crazy, it's definitely faster now. I had to hotkey my fucking soups to keep well fed.
---
tse handmades go for about 3 to 8k on ps4
---
If the event has happened in a server, there's a timer that has to expire before it can be started again on that specific server.
---
Maybe they will tone down some of the explosion effects people were talking about concerning the new boss fight.
---
Ohhhh ok
---
You have to buy the card and then fix it at a tinker bench.
---
Eh I'm not so sure. With the imposter sheepsquatch,  I don't get many hits in. I run melee, so when I do actually find the damn thing, I get a couple hits then die, all while taking conduit damage. The rest of the time I spent dodging bots and looking for the invisible asshole. I don't currently have the guns to make an impact with them. 
---
If it's something like the queen, and almost everyone is doing their part but one or two are hiding taking pot shots, I don't really care if they get anything. However if there's a whole group of them holding their dicks/ boobs while the rest of us get out asses beat by her majesty, they can fuck right off.
---
They really.... pulled the wool over our eyes...
---
I know 
---
But it gives you so little
---
The plan sorting issue appears to simply be alphabetical sorting, but ignores the (Known) tag at the beginning.  This wouldn't be so bad if you could sort by Known.
---
Hm, this was deep, like centre of the event, both of us were there
---
Are you on PS4? Anychance you wanna join the hunter/hunted quest for the weekly?

Use the scrapper perk when breaking down

Running it on my 2 year old dell inspiron 15 laptop. Got an i5 processor and I don’t even know what graphics card, with 4GB of ram. Game looks surprisingly good and runs just fine. Definitely would be better with a nice rig, but I don’t want to spend the money and what I got works. Also I refuse to move to console because I would never give up a mouse and keyboard for a controller.
---
Sadly I’m on Xbox, sorry.
---
Lol.  It’s like every other thing Bethesda does.  Two steps forward and one step back.
---
I do 
---
It just annoys me how hard it is to get some scraps
---
Not the scorchedbeast queen or the imposter sheepsquatch lol
---
FX 8350, 16gb DDR3, RX 480 Nitro 8gb, 120gb SSD, running on a USB wifi dongle. I get pretty steady 60 fps on high except for times when I fight sentry bots, assaultrons, scorchbeasts, and anything that goes ham with explosives. I play on low just so I don't get drastic drops like that, but I basically played all the way until the mire on high because it started becoming unbearable after that.
---
I keep the Fallout Radio YouTube live stream on while I'm playing. It cycles through all the previous games radio stations, complete with the DJ dialogue. It's both enjoyable and nostalgic. [https://youtu.be/7ZKX2fPHKNo](https://youtu.be/7ZKX2fPHKNo)
---
Is there a repair pack they can sell you?
---
Love it when the OP is “triggered”...thx for the giggle!
---
The buttons are backwards tho. I almost confirmed it trying to back out. 😡
---
Having actual mechanics to a fight sounds like exactly the kind of invested difficulty people want. What would you rather have, just a bigger hit point pool and/or higher damage resistance?
---
Is this game worth getting now? I've been seeing alot of bad things and I was excited for this game just know better than to preorder games by now.
---
Thanks and great info.  
---
1) Replicated and reported   
---
2)The VATS's issue I'll resubmit on a separate page, want to try and keep this limited to Patch 8 related bugs, will help keep things organized!   
---
3) Did you have Chameleon armor on or just standard armor?  
---
4) This popped into existence in Patch 7, and I've seen it myself, but I'll document here and submit!
---
I know that
---
Ah 2 GB of vram would probably force you to all low but other than that, that's a pretty beefy setup. I'd say your 2080Ti would have you completely set up. I'm starting to think one or more of my components might have some issues though. I've tried every way in the world to make this game playable but it just won't work but oh well, that's technology.
---
Hard to say if they were slower as it's hard to gauge now. It might have been projectile changed to hitscan, but there should still be some kind of visual.
---
But it's a feature tho
---
Found the F3 slaver
---
To me it seemed like there was no damage done to each other during the event but as soon as the event ends its open season, and some people like to open fire right at that moment and take people out before they can react.
---
Good info thanks!
---
Yea ive seen em..and the messed up part is i could understand if it wS like the ones on me or somethin..but they ghosted my stash and my carry...but only the two shots. The game just started gettin good..and now i feel like all the grind was for nothing.
---
Great idea! Unfortunately it's probably a cost issue and not an implementation one. Although I would love to see being able to grab like 5 or so records we could give to the DJ, maybe tie it to the account.
---
it's been patched, but it hasn't been fixed. The whole PVP meta is donked up because of you guys.
---
I'm confused too, I was hoping that the ones on the board would change out each day to have different quests, even if they were repeats with different rewards, but I just checked and nothing. Really hope it's not like a really really low drop rate for certain creatures to drop their head. Example: Kill mothman and have 0.2% or something for plan drop ya know what I mean. I hope it's not like that.
---
All I know is 2 days ago we had an SBQ event.  8-10 lvl 100+ participating. We timed out.  Barely got 50% damage.  And plenty of high level weapons and armor were involved.  This is some serious bullshit. 
---
This latest patch was really good but in my estimation it’s one of the only things Bethesda did correctly.
---
I would just like some of the garbage items taken out of the pool. You know the items that exist for novelty or just to make actual good drops more rare. 
---
Looking at you wood armor, rolling pins and pool cues.
---
I have this game on console and if the game is running good for you on your laptop then I don't think there would be much of a change other than visually but that's really surprising honestly, I have an Inspiron 15 as well but its using an i3, I can't remember what generation it is.
---
Known bug. Expect Bethesda to fix it quickly as it's a paid paintjob and they're unlikely to let sales fall
---
That means the event already ran on that server in the last 3 hours, your either need to wait it out or server-hop to a server where it hasn’t been run recently.
---
Yeah i checked as well hoping for a daily stuff like BIV quests, but nope.
---
My guess is they going to implement other quests overtime.
---
I think this is the patch that screwed with it.
---

---
It’s not always true there was this level  9 player running around reviving people. He was trying to help just didn’t know how.
---
Dang, really? My build is roughly the same and my performance is absolute ass sadly. I can't keep 60 frames without stuttering every 2-10 seconds. The mire scares me though, all of the god rays, swaying trees and grass.
---
It's honestly a question only you can answer, you know what you like better than we do. Don't be afraid to try something you think you might enjoy.
---
I think you took their innocent question like it was an insult.  Calm down.
---
I just posted a response. I have big league weapons and did an event on Tuesday.  So did many other high level players.  We crapped out.  Complete bullshit.  SBQ was laughing at us.  No way 10 lvl 100+ players couldn’t make a dent.
---
Not a bug just crap way of ending it. You are done with the quest line once you get to the pylons (Anti-climatic huh) Now you just have to wait your three hours to trigger the boss fight.
---
I don't think anyone said that, rather that it's either bad or is delivered in a bad way (holotapes)
---
1hr? i thought it was 3 hrs
---
Fast travel
---
Now that the spirit
---
I get to see the rewards and people talk about it before i do it though. Hypes it up.
---
No, I mean the unit itself
---
I could be mistaken but after the patch I checked out all the new shops and not one of them had any player sold items in 1star legendaries someone sold.  I was only on for an hour or so though.  people were in the area also and on map so It was odd.
---
That’s awesome they fixed that
---
You'll have to pay caps to move your camp
---
Is it just me or do they also not have any mods for sale?
---
I could probably do better now that I have a few hundred hours under my belt instead of it being my second or third day playing. Shame we only get 5 character slots so even if I do a build for one (or more) of them I don't have room to try it out.
---
Alright, that’s what I thought.
---
Liberty Prime. Dont see that imposter chucking mini nukes like footballs.
---
I'm wearing a full shrouded set on my sniper. It's great for stealth.
---
One hit kills and invisible invincibility? Wow what great mechanics. Don’t get me wrong the concept is great and the idea of having to activate these pylons is amazing but damage over time on top of a one hit kill enemy who is invisible and invincible for the majority of the time is not ‘actual mechanics’
---
Can't wait! Lol
---
Most of the time yes. I still get crashes. Also alot of  loot-loading and fps issues during Queen fights but I believe thats due to a poorly optimised game.
---
No, many people thought "no human npc's = no story", and then when they played they ignored all the tapes and notes, just going from quest marker to quest marker, ignoring the actual story.
---
As for it being delivered baldy, i strongly disagree. I love the environmental storytelling and journal entries. It's a breath of fresh air after so many games of just saying the plot to you.
---
And by a "couple" do you mean 3 characters with maxed out stash boxes and 1500 pounds over carry weight, all in useless 3* legendary weapons and armor you saved since day 1?
---
Well I haven't played recently so maybe the updates will fuck my frames up, but that's what I had in January. It might also be your internet though, you should check it out. Either way I just recommend lowering the quality since the difference is hardly different. I'm still kinda pissed that the firebreather backpack thing is blurry no matter what, tho.
---
Yeah, sorry I misunderstood
---
I've only gotten 5 three stars drops in my entire 200 hours. I've killed dozens of 3 star enemies. I started counting between the 3 star drops, I'm at 16, 3 starred enemies without a 3 star drop. 3 of those enemiea dropped nothing.
---
I can drive between the two in 2 to 2 1/2 hrs
---
One person can be the conduct for more than one pylon.
---
Thanks for the feedback. :)
---
And wood armor. At least fron the 3 star pool, please mercy please.
---
Hopefully, I'm also considering if they might of made them drop off the creature that your looking for, but as a low chance to drop you could say.
---
My pleasure. See ya out in  the wastes fellow vault dweller!
---
No, not really.  In previous fallouts there is no need to worry about the economy so they can let's caps fly but in multiplayer you have an actual player economy to worry about.  We already have inflation because of the massive influx of duped legendaries no need to make Venezuela levels of inflation!
---
This thread jinxed me. Ran into TWO rad storms today.
---
Oh, ok. Well, then. They should’ve made it more clear. Lol I thought my game was bugged.
---
Yeah I'm going to see what the Low-Present-Gang is like real quick, it does suck ass though because that's the outfit I'm wearing right now and the blurry ass patch and backpack kill the outfit for me.

I tried to reproduce the layout of my apartment, which is a long rectangle, and it will barely fit within the CAMP perimeter. When I say barely, I mean that I couldn't even put an electrical conduit on the wall because it sticks out a few inches and would have been outside the barrier.  If I could move the perimeter circle a bit, or blueprint the entire structure this wouldn't be a problem, but as is my only choice is to completely rebuild the CAMP or move it.
---
I made a thread about my Gatling Laser issues.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbj4fo/bug_with_gatling_lasers/

There are tons of these post, Bethesda has already commented on this issue and many others this last patch has brought on.
---
Good idea on the ticket, and I’ll walk them through the quest line and see if it works. Thanks mate!

---
Not really generic 3 stars aren't much more effort of resources to kill. 
---
But the bosses are. Generic 3 stars keep them whatever way,  maybe trim down the loot pools slightly and give a boost to getting higher stars. But the bosses, they should at least minimum drop 2 stars preferably 3 stars, at least for the person who started the event. Its pricy, 2000 caps and tons of resources.
---
That's a deep cut bro
---
It’s good to know that a 14 year old is the one deciding who is and isn’t an idiot based on their favorite YouTuber.

---
Still really don't like their "optimizations" as this rig will max out FPS on pretty much every other game I play (RB6/Deus Ex come to mind as most recent, it slayed Destiny 2 as well).
---
You're right, it's not strictly an MMO considering the player count per server alone. But it has many hallmarks of traditional MMOs, and I was trying to explain the fact that games roughly in this category have higher maintenance costs. I can't think of a single game which is long-term, multiplayer, not peer-to-peer and not self-hosted which doesn't have some sort of annoying passive income. PUBG has loot boxes, ARMA 3 has DLC and self-hosted servers and traditional MMOs have subscriptions. None of them are optimal for an end consumer, but it's just a drawback of online multiplayer games in general.
---
Keep in mind I'm not trying to defend them by any means and I do think it's scummy to go back on a pre-release promise as it shows their failure to forecast finances. I'm just trying to help people understand why the decision may have been made, and why it's definitely not the worst option that they could have chosen (loot boxes, content paywalls etc are worse imo).
---
No you can’t.

Yes Overseer, this comment right here.

hit me up if u find anything new first.
---
ATTENTION PYLON GODS!  Do not immediately respawn if you go down but don't die.  A dying pylon god is still a pylon god.
---
ATTENTION SHEEP SQUASHERS!  Do not stimpack downed pylon gods, at least not right away!  They'll just go down again right away, although this seems to reset the 30 second forced-respawn timer.
---
Oh, I see. Well, Bethesda should at least give an indication that the quest was completed. I thought it was bugged.
---
I rather get the crossbow down and cemented first and then add a compound bow.
---
Agreed on the rest but isn't holotapes literally them telling the plot to you? In a game with NPCs you would probably see the events unfolding before you instead of it just being explained to you which is far far more boring imo.

What
---
Isn’t that exactly what the OPs suggestion would fix, if someone holds the workshop, then they are open to being killed and you take the workshop, or they relinquish it and you take it,  nobody wants to lock it down to whoever gets it first. 
---
Even the limited Pvp area requests, you either fight for it, at its location, or you time out the returning to defend it, or relinquish it and the other person gets it.
---
Yeah but it would be nice to get a solid chunk of loot. Maybe even just a 2 star minimum, or at least make the chances for a 3 starred item much better, maybe even make it more unique where this event has a better chance to drop 3 starred armor but very low chance for weapons, and another event later could do the opposite. 
---
Its a unique boss, the loot pool for legendaries should reflect that. Even if its not 100% all the time. It would be nice if it was weighted with a higher benefit. Maybe have it drop 2 random legendaries, if you don't wanna mess with the loot table.
---
Ideally you get where I'm coming from right? Make the loot drop different, substantially and encourage players to farm and join in not just short term but long term.
---
Lol um I’m guessing you want the method.  Day tripper, moonshine, two armor pieces, and grape mentats.  With hard bargaining 3.
---
To me, it's a taste *so bad* that I want to *vomit in Tim Howard's face*.
---
Thanks for the info.   
---
A few of these are part of issues mentioned.  
---
The Robot issues appear new and a few reports of it.     
---
The Armor Weight reduction issue is pre-Patch 8, one of them I think was an Stealth Nerd (Aid) in Patch 7.   
---
Crashing upon entering is new..   
---
Could you give me some more details on the Fast travel armor issue, is it un-equipping or vanishing from Inventory?  
---
The Event Icon's are patch 7, but will report.
---
I add a * to the name of all my current armor so that its all together and at the top of me menus, plus it helps not having gear to scrap mixed in with gear you use.
---
Rog laptop with 1060 and 16gig ram, runs 1080 all max, no issues
---
Nice dude
---
I tend to always get legendary wood arnor drops with abilities on par as if a giant sloth wiped its ass with it.
---
I noticed a nice new bug. When modifying armor or weapons, after repairing any item, the stats/conditions no longer appear on the left of the screen until you exit the bench and begin crafting again
---
I'm really talking more about exposition. I'd rather find a security recording or a journal of someone in the moment of the event being described than have someone just stand there and say "yeah this thing happened 25 years ago."
---
Yea, it's a bummer, but it's the only way if you can't get it to highlight/move
---
Currently waiting to see the respawn, checking it every hour. Last one on my server was 1 hour and 45 mins ago.
---
My best weapon(s) frequently break, even in the middle of a fight (particularly w SBQ), but, I'm only level 122, so I guess I'm still a peon.
---
Max out these perks: rifleman and its variants, Covert Operative, Sneak, Escape Artist, Mr Sandman, Starched Genes, Radicool, and Nerd Rage. 
---
Then get the adrenal reaction mutation. For armor get a mix of Unyielding, Bolstering, and Chameleon. For weapons you want either Anti-Armor, or Bloodied. Explosive would also be nice but its not necessary. 
---
Go to West Tek and grab as much green toxic goo as you can, and drink them until you get to under 10% health. 
---
To explain this build, with the power of nerd rage, adrenal reaction, and the bloodied effect you are getting INSANE damage since the dmg multipliers stack.  The unyielding and bolstering will give lots of special points and damage resistance, and the radicool will give you lots of extra strength. Finally, all the stealth is obviously not to die with constantly being at low health, and to max out the sneak attacks you will be constantly doing. This build is very fun, and arguably more powerful than melee
---
Those are all viable.  The AAE shotgun is comparatively valuable.  Ignore all offers to sell.
---
Are you saying my bathrobe is junk?
---
Stealth rifleman is good too (lever action or dragon - I prefer lever because dragon reload sucks)
---
Luck has nothing to do with 3 star spawn rates. It only effects the dropped durability.
---
maybe you should see a therapist
---
Damn, just okay? I've never played a game with such a costly barrier to play for a PC. My build runs everything really well in my experience for what I want it to do, hell, I even average 90-120 FPS on PUBG but this game struggles at keeping up 45 on the lowest damn settings I've had to run a game at.
---
They just went in there Pip-Boy and left the event and then killed you you can't retaliate cuz you're still in the event go Bethesda
---
You can get them by grinding the new event
---
Or working period
---
My friend has 25 luck, he only gets a 3 starred drop about 10% of the time. I have 14. 
---
Luck has absolutely no effect, its been proven time and time again, stop perpetuating this false information.
---
yeah I liked the event today, but I only got a bloodied knife or something like that, I don't even use the knives in the game. They should add an automatic 3* weapon, and some ammo for each weapon other then heavies (fat mans, missle launchers etc.)
---
It goes against the Fallout franchise design. SPECIAL points are what make your character.
---
Yep, I'm using a lvl 50 version and I'm loving it.  I've been able to sneak right up in enemies faces and shoot them almost point blank and get the sneak multiplier several times before they notice me.
---
Adults rob banks, adults sell crack cocaine, adults fuck over millions of Americans by ridiculously raising the prices of pharmaceuticals and insurance costs setting us back decades - even causing people to "cut back" on needed medication and ***dying*** as a result.  
---
Just because we're adults, doesn't mean we should be really fucking awful assholes/criminals/child rapping scumbags - same goes with Pay To Cheat - ***JUST DON'T DO IT*** it fucking sucks, it's a *plague* on the world of video games and the companies that do it are vile fucking greedy scumbags.
---
Heres to hoping they fix the 4:8:2000. Seriously, i just want to play again. Or even just a response from Bethesda. Thats it.
---
Bring on the accusations and downvotes.
---
Server disconnects seem to be making a return. They were very often after the game release because people were using them to dupe items.  
---
But after the last patch, the disconnects are back. Can't do anything about players being asses.
---
Yes the game needs to become more like an MMO and less like an actual game. Grind away!
---
Yea works just fine. I think this might be the last generation of games I can get away with it though. Pretty sure I’m going to have to upgrade for cyberpunk and starfield
---
You get your first walk mount right after starting the quest.
---
Same, on Xbox with brick walls, this is pretty ugly.
---
i don’t even care if I die in a fight because I know I’m not gonna lose much, I would actually think through what I’m gonna do before I do it if I knew i could lose everything
---
This is a very good question! I will talk with my partner and come up with rules regarding this perk. I will get back to you as soon as I possibly can as well as editing the original post to reflect the decision we make.
---
Sucks to hear. What system are you on?
---
I wouldn't expect too much. If all you get is a token for your 3 star legendary, then use it to get just another random 3 star legendary, its unlikely you will get a god-roll 3 star weapon or armor piece. If you have 20 tokens maybe you'll get lucky, but its probably going to be even more random than killing those legendaries in the first place. At least the type of enemy, the session/world and your stats had some bearing on the weapon/armor that you got.
---
The "whining entitled brats" are the wealthy tax evaders and the corporations that use "but we need to increase profits" as justification to do shitty things to their customers - the opposite of what they *should* be doing, and would do, if corporations weren't basically amoral/immoral once they grow larger than a "mom and pop" size operation.
---
That would be OK, ***if they didn't sell atoms for $$$***
---
This skin deleted my arms for my PA so furious
---
I highly doubt they let you turn stalkers’ rolling pin into bloodied handmade. It’s probably exchanging for something similar, rifle for rifle and machinegun for machinegun. So when you have a three star you will get a three star which just might have the feature you are looking for.
---
Yeah but this is a unique boss right? Why not give it a different chance to drop legendaries, make it more rewarding without a guarantee. Like make it have a higher chance of dropping armor and weigh it closer to 3 stars without it being a sure thing, maybe grant more bonus weight for the person who summoned the thing. Maybe even weigh it for a higher chance of a specific mod maybe troubleshooter. Maybe not. 
---
Give players a reason to farm in past getting the unique recipes and drops. It'll help longterm. 
---
You get ideally how that would nake the game better? Not a guarantee but maybe an increased chance or more uniqueness to the drop table.
---
Seriously, your weapon drops from 200% to broken during one fight?
---
Depends on your playstile. Meele build with 15 STR is bad ass, but some ppl hate  close combat. So rreally depends what you like to play.
---
Also welcome back.
---
If you're OK with game companies doing Pay To Cheat, then you must be OK with companies selling forged university diplomas too?
---
No, don’t let your assumptions get ahead of you.
---
I've put atleast 150 hours into the game and ive seen 1, each one lasted about a minute.
---
Lol, i must have changed it because for me it Y to use and pickup things. I hate when games put the jump on something else than A because in most other games it is A.
---
But it always feel weird when Y make me jump in build mode. I usually exit build mode to jump.
---
Lmao have you put in anytime to actually farm? Or are you mad cause you’re not getting what you want?
---
I was shook
---
Ya they did something. They need to balance the grind/reward ratio desperately.
---
Yeah, it ends so abruptly that I legit thought it got bugged. Lol
---
It should at least say quest completed, then wait 3 hours or something like that.
---
Thanks b
---
It’s by design.  Wouldn’t be surprised to see more of this in the future.
---
My TSE Lever does, if I'm fighting a Scorch Beast Queen, yes - I can't afford to use Perk Slots on Gunsmith (to reduce breakage) or else the damage I do is ***shit** - it's *already shit* compared to stupid Melee weapons even with max perks allotted to increase damage!
---
I'm holding 3 of those 3* pool cues now...they're nice and light. 😛
---
Lol yeah. Last night i saw the event pop-up and droped everything i was looting to sell and rushed my ass there.
---
Not sure if this is a bug, but Underarmor (Marine Wetsuit, Enclave Underarmor, etc.) that used to show gloves while wearing an outfit on top don't any more. You still get the bonuses, but the gloves don't show.
---
Pushed out to the upcoming patch next month. I assume there were major issues to iron out.
---
Is 708 hours enough time?
---
No those are rookie numbers
---
Why are you carrying 400 bottles of water with you anyways?
---
Just me I guess. I can't be a hoarder in real life so I do it in fallout.
---
I will admit that my sample size was “2”.  I found this out by sheer accident. Was at my CAMP during a rad storm, and noticed one of the nearby trees looked funny. I thought it was a graphics glitch, and went over to check it out. Whatever was on that tree (honey?) had turned into flux.  Another tree had the same flux. I can’t remember what type of flux it was, but I know it wasn’t cobalt (that’s what I’m searching for, to upgrade my vault suit lining).
---
Yes I’m a Responder; I’m here to serve the wanderers of Appalachia.  I drop off free stuff at Whitesprings...
---
Yeah but even you can admit the loot system does have some outwardly bad design elements, the chances if legendaries is fine but right now there is a ton of junk items in the lootpool that honestly shouldn't even exist in the game. They serve no purpose, they exist only to make drops less valuable. They add no meaningful choice or benefits. They only exist as filler. 
---
Looking at you wood armor.
---
May 7
---
This needs to be stickied... I literally did the event the last three matches and it was a hot fucing mess of people not knowing what the fuck was going on.
---
So I'm not the only one that lost legendary gear last patch? 😢 Rip
---
Yeah, exactly.. They look so out of place. And it kinda makes me feel uncomfortable. It's like oh.. hey, *sorry* for dragging you away from your factioned area..
---
In the last 2 days I've found 1/20th of what I was finding before the update. Something is fucky!!!!!
---
No definitely not
---
I don't mean to nitpick, but almost all of his morality videos are from over two years ago.  That's not recent.  You keep citing this one example, but have no actual proof.  I watched the Shaun one, for example, and nothing like said mentioned was mentioned.
---
I'm open to other views, but if there's proof, you need to link to it, "giving him more views" be damned.  Otherwise, your repeated insistence that it exists is worthless.
---
Yes. And tbf, if you just join in the event in progress, there is very little info explaining why the hell is going on. I activated pylons but didn’t realize it was damaging me for the first event I ran. Thought i was getting smacked by another cloaked enemy or something. I’m guessing if you complete the full questline or are the one starting the event it explains it more, but as someone who eagerly jumps into it because a ‘new event’ text pops on-screen, good luck. Just tag whatever you can, try to take out the boss when shield is down, and go online afterwards to read what the hell is going on in this event. Fun as hell, though- way more fun than the SBQ
---
Exactly! There is no real consequence for dying in the game right now. Where is the need for strategy to take on another team? You can just run at them over and over again. I think making survival harder would add immersion and fun for everyone willing to play
---
Camp plans, dispenses drinks it says.
---
It would be nice, and I do hope what you've said is true. Because if this is the final product.... I don't like it. I'm sorry!
---
Just accumulated over a while/super thirsty. Didn't think I would lose all of it
---
I'm TrIGgERd
---
Obligatory can you put your camp there comment
---
No u
---
Some people’s conclusion is if you have certain kinds of weapons in your inventory you’re likely to get more of them. Maybe keeping a grenade launcher or rocket launcher in your inventory will help?
---
I got u
---
[Super Stimpak ×1]
---
Xbox
---
Says the guy on the trading Reddit..... LOL
---
I saw they highlighted enemies and thought "eh they dont zoom but at least I dont have to craft a recon scope now"   I had no idea that it could zoom.  Thanks for letting me know about this now I can see even farther while still shaking my head back and forth.
---
Agree, tasted a bitter when i realised after purchasing the survival pack with military camo that i got inside also green combat armor + green PA camo that i already purchased before.
---
From the forum:
---
&gt; Starting at 10:00 a.m. EDT on Thursday, April 11 we’re planning to bring Fallout 76 offline across all platforms to perform maintenance and apply an improvement for server stability.
---
&gt; We will let you know as soon as downtime begins, and you can return to this thread for updates as maintenance progresses. Please note: We will not be making any gameplay changes tomorrow, so there will be no patch notes following this update.
---
So no gameplay changes yet...
---
With reason of course.
---
Yeah buddy rookie numbers
---
Good on you guys, I bought exactly one thing but haven't played in 2 months. Keep supporting it so I can play a good game in a year. o7
---
Is there an enclave vendor there
---
Well good sir and with all due respect imagine having supported this game on release day and having ran into the inferno of issues we all did.
---
Then imagine shaping your gameplay a certain way for Bethesda to change an aspect of the game that TRASHES everything you've been setting up and grinding for. Done without a way to salvage your game and the new direction it has to go.
---
Then imagine not being able to rename ANYTHING until several months later and having scrapped one of a kind items numerous because of this.
---
Then imagine your lack of patience because FO4 did have the fixes that FO76 seemed to have left out and several months later still don't have implemented. 
---
Now you'll sort of kind of understand why so many have hated on this game. The response time imo is unforgivable with the fixes which usually messed up several other things. So much of this was a fuckin clown show that I'll never forget despite being fairly patient and ok with some of the bugs which give it a flavor in some cases.
---
Then there's you walking into the party months later blind to the happenings saying how great things are lol.
---
I been a bunch of times the only cool item I believe is a bobble head. Ppl seem to miss it because I have gotten it a bunch of times with others running around.
---
Good point. With player vending I can imagine e people wanting to dump stuff off like at a train station.  At least a garbage can that works would be great.
---
I just want to know what type of person favorites a scrappable auto grenade launcher...
---
And that is where you're wrong friend. This game is great, yes there are some aspects that need tweaking, but Bethesda are monitoring and listening.. And making changes where they're needed.
---
You would think you having 700 hours in the game you’d understand that’s it’s RNG
---
Like real life fucking ticks? Wtf?
---
The "is it moral to leave synth sean" wasn't 2 years ago, it was right before fo76 came out, so late september early october.
---
&gt;I'm open to other views, but if there's proof, you need to link to it, "giving him more views" be damned. Otherwise, your repeated insistence that it exists is worthless.
---
The problem is that the perks are stupid.
---
If I advanced the quest am I locked out of this?
---
u/Aten_Ra , still no legendary pipe revolvers in game. Would really appreciate shining a light on what is a quite a large issue for those of us who love the pipe revolver!
---
Apparently homosexuality is a son, but greed and gluttony get a pass
---
You are not going to force your idea of PAY TO WIN on me.
---
PAY TO WIN means you ONLY can get the same power/end results as a money spending, which in this case is not true at all.
---
PAY TO WIN is for example:  pay 5bucks and you do 50% more dmg and take 50% more dmg less and the only way to get this buff is with money.  THAT is pay to win.
---
I am sorry that you and a lot of other do not understand the diff between pay to win and pay for advancement.  But that is the thing, at the end, everyone is the same power level.  One takes time and the other takes money -- but the end results are the same.
---
Why you people do not understand that, is beyond me.
---
Yeah, agreed. It's nice to have everything in one spot. And don't get me wrong, I'm not shit-canning this update in any way, shape or form. I love it, but there are some *improvements* that they need... and **soon**.
---
It's not false it's been in previous fallout games and 14 luck isn't going to do much. It increases chances of rare enemies spawning in and rare loot when you kill it
---
"people like me"  you are right, people with jobs, families, and other hobbies besides school and gaming.
---
You mean adults.  Yeah.
---
This is a great idea. It lets you save time etc. How many times I've forgot to take off a building perk and put the damage perk on etc.
---
Agreed. Having access to everything in one spot.. gives me vibes of New Vegas, and when you visit The Strip. I do hope they make some necessary adjustments later.
---
It’s fantastic!
---
I picked up the the holotape and it keeps telling me to pick it up. I did have 3/4 and now it's 2/4 for some reason...
---
Jumbled on my ps4. None of the sort options separate them.
---
We are sticking with what I said originally. All perks are allowed!
---
Is there anything else besides stealth/melee builds? I'd rather be at full health, maybe like energy weapons or heavy weapons?
---
I dump a lot of the trash ones I get... and boy is there a ton
---
I've only played this event once so far, but as a unyielding bloodied unarmed build (primarily, I do have some nice guns), this became my strategy and my thoughts are:
---
* Get your licks in quick then get out quick, or you will die. Sneaking will get you up to the ISS, but you will hit danger quick. It took me 3 hits to get it to half health, then it regenerated, I hit it twice more before it regenerated again (bug maybe?) and killed me after it killed the guy face tanking it in PA. That sucker hits like a truck!
---
* I tried again and died again. I noticed the numerous lvl 52 gutsy's and figured I'll help out that way. I had no issues staying in caution and killed a crap ton, including a couple legendaries, so there's that 'bonus'.
---
* The exploding eyebots were annoying, but as mentioned, I do have guns, so not a huge deal.
---
* Low levels not recommended, but if you must, kill the exploding eyebots. And not while a player is near. The roof is not really a safe spot, it only gives you better field of vision at the cost of the number of robots able to shoot at you. Stick and move!
---
* Teamwork makes the dream work: High health players should hit up the pylons. Bloodied builds should maintain the perimeter. VATS snipers would be very handy. And hit the fallen players with a stimpack that aren't obvious pylon conduits--there's lots of killing to be done and downtime doesn't help.
---
That's all I got for now.
---
AWOL armaments at Roboco is better
---
I don't know. I'll try again and seen. It's technically at a location already, but it may be high enough to be out of the locations boundaries.
---
Ok, thanks for letting me know.
---
I'm glad someone liked the way I set this up. My wife gave me strange looks as I was typing this up. But the moment I my post back to her, she understood real quick what the issue was.   
---
I hope they listen too.
---
I am so sick of this.   I have more bulk to sell than will fit in my stash.  I have bulk on me to sell.  I'm sick and tired of not being able to scrap stuff when I'm in the middle of selling stuff.  The vendor changes help, but sometimes I have bulk left over ready for the next run.   Scrap all shouldn't scrap bulk... This was already fixed once.
---
Yea this is ridiculous. Bad enough they thought it was a good idea to put the know plans on top to begin with, but now this? I swear no one who works on this game actually plays it or even does testing.
---
Had anybody ever officially explained why some modders have seemingly fixed numerous issues almost overnight without breaking the game yet Bethesda several months later is now just letting us rename things?
---
Ok, but the comment chain I replied to went like this:  
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 star aren't harder to kill
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; But they regenerate
---
&gt;&gt;&gt; So do 1 stars
---
&gt;&gt; Not if you kill them in 1 hit
---
&gt; (Me) same for 3 stars
---
So, from the context here, it's pretty obvious we're talking about normal 3 stars versus 1 stars in this comment chain.
---
Yep
---
lol
---
I was sorta intrigued by the vault tec lino floors but sad to find them in the bundle only and it struck me as odd that other items in that bundle are available for purchase yet the floors only in the bundle. I ...only want the floors  :/
---
Great info, thank you...  
---
Documented and reported.  
---
The Container bit... more of a QoL issue don't you think (vs. Bug)
---
Sure, having it drop proper loot should be a thing!
---
I just don't think that loot is the only reason to play, and I love the fight, it is actually hard, and a lot of fun.
---
In my language they translated bloodbug to tick and gave tick the name of their "family". Translators can be weird.
---
I had 2 pylons on me last time i did it, and was wearing t-51b with scaly skin, lone wanderer, fireproof, Emergency protocols and was able to tank the two pylons and the sheep fairly well. you still take a shit ton of damage so get ready to burn some stims, but yes, high E-resist seemed to help, although it might be considered fire damage so fireproof may have been doing the work.
---
I'm on xbox and killed more than 20 people just last night alone in pvp and have not gotten the achievement
---
Yes, it's odd that still is not fixed, I'll do another Weapon's roundup soon
---
Ok, that's nice, but none of my weapons at my level are non legendary, legendary is always better than non if it's the same level.  What about selling or dropping stuff that are favorited?  THAT is my concern.
---
I mainly get up on the roof and blast the robots with my shotty. Hate those gusty's so much
---
Mine actually decreased, have you unequipped and re-equipped your perk cards? (Post patch it's sometimes required)
---
I actually tested this for a whole week, maxed luck to 15 points got mostly wood legs and arms. So i moved some of the points back and left 11 points, the same day I got a bloodied explosive assault rifle, much better than the garbage I got when it was at 15. No it has nothing to do with loot quality, at least for me.
---
Reported, thanks!
---
To be honest I would have just blown up the bus he was hiding in and took his loot.
---
Its going to take me days to cart all my trash to the legendary vendor once he shows up.
---
Still? I'll add this to the New Weapons Roundup when I can.
---
the only thing to note is that reviving a pylon god keeps them a pylon god, so there is no down period in keeping all three pylons activated.
---
But yeah, its a good idea to let them sit down for a sec
---
I was about to do this and forgot that lives would be lost.
---
**Questions:**  
---
-What PA?  
---
-What Mods?  
---
-If you remove the legs (Un-Equip them) and they have Calibrate shocks, does your total carry weight change?
---
Here are a few bugs to add.
---
#Power Armor Issues
---
Renaming power armor, and carrying more than 1 set with you in your Inventory.. will sometimes either absorb the name of another set - or revert to "Power Armor Chassis"
---
#Trading Issue
---
When YOU request an item from another player, the word "Requested" next to the item is missing. If this was intentional.. it's a bad design element. You CAN however see "Requested" when someone requests something FROM you. So it only works one direction.
---
#Weapon Issues
---
Grognak's Axe still cannot be repaired past 100, and Luck of the Draw does not work on it as well still. These used to be possible, and it works with any other melee weapon.
---
Good to know that the freeze issue is not only on PC.
---
Misery loves company. :P
---
I renamed my power fist the "cunt puncher".
---
The bus was already blown up. You can hide in them even after they exploded and they serve as excellent shelter to be honest.
---
Good Question...   
---
What is it doing this time?
---
Blasphemy!
---
You sir need better weapons to kill them b4 they can regen. I just happen to have AAE dragon I could sell you...😂
---
Its stuttery as hell. Hopefully the hot fix addresses it
---
I dropped it in a bag, friend picked it up and was able to add the mod.
---
Any possibility you could craft a lvl 50 one for me?
---
It only happened to me and my Ultracite, when I erased the whole name. For my T-60 I tabbed left and typed T-60 in front and it came out normal.
---
Ugh. Now I have to go get this. Super duper easy.
---
I kind of agree. It’s a game for fun not a guaranteed reward system. I just would like them to remove drill and syringer and wood pieces from multiple star creatures. They are the real insult bots when it happens.
---
Tbh I dont understand why they ever thought stash weight was a good idea.
---
[deleted]
---
Just get more
---
I'll definitely be doing this on my original character. My build is really messed up, and I'd welcome an opportunity to start anew.
---
Cool exactly at the time i play the game...
---
Good Info!  
---
The SuperDuper could just be insanely bad luck, and this account seems to have it's share (I run 4, and there is SERIOUSLY noticeable RNG differences between them) but 30+ constructions and no SuperDupers seemed odd, I mean that was an hour of crafting and upgrading, so leaned towards bug.
---
They’ve already been nerfed
---
That's how Mike Tyson was. In the ring he's the greatest boxer of all time.
---
Outside the ring is another story.
---
I'm ok with somebody still watching him box or not watching him because of his personal behavior. 
---
I think it's a personal choice that nobody else should be up in arms judging you about your choice.
---
Personally I don't watch him but because I wish I had 4 hours to blow watching a person play a game.
---
Do you have any Mods?  
---
Not judging (I use them) just curious for troubleshooting purposes!
---
ouch!  
---
Could you grab some photos for me to link and submit on the reports?
---
I had same issue, consensus is bug. Same mask too.
---
Thank you
---
That sounds more like my issue
---
That's just your luck. At the end of the day it's still all luck, but every store owner I know has max or high luck
---
You cant repair them they dont have condition
---
Excellent, glad to be of assistance! 
---
For number 3, I was wearing unyielding armor, no chameleon pieces equipped, only the mutation present.
---
*nod* Documented and reported, seriously frustrating.
---
PvP is coming back to adventure mode because for some reason they made it more profitable to murder innocents there
---
Level 100 killed in survival post patch? 25 caps
---
Level 100 killed in adventure mode? 100 caps
---
Morons!  2K cap I don’t think so
---
Server stability.
---
You are not the only one to notice this.  
---
I went and checked and I don't see any changes on the NPC's themselves that would cause this, documented and reported!
---
All of them or just some? Explosive shotguns are pretty OP.
---
Damn, really? I feel like I still get bodied by them in like 1 second.
---
I've had the same thing happen to me too!!!! With that same mask as well!!
---
a PS4 player mentioned something similar, mind scrolling down and finding that comment and seeing if it matches (and responding)..  
---
Hoping to get a video of the issue to submit.
---
Yeah, but you have to admit, the PLAYER is pretty lucky in this case :)
---
Hero luck may not be a thing for the loot tanks, but, RedEyeJeditwinsuns, themselves had a good luck score :)
---
Damage goes down when you put Strange in Numbers on. Pretty much the opposite of what should happen
---
Could you go into more detail?  
---
Stuck on or off?
---
This is a really good idea
---
It’s linked to your sfx
---
Made a post about this when the game released
---
Has never changed
---
Genius decision
---
Idk I bet it’s the shotguns, cause someone above said apparently most of them have already been nerfed.
---
They do. Not sure about all the other ones but this one does
---
Yea but exploding vehicles next to them will in fact kill them. Regardless of being in pacifist mode. It’s not me killing them it’s the environment.
---
Can confirm fallout 76 works fine with name change bro!
---
It's broken then it's a glitch
---
I got the imposter head the first time, I wouldve rather had the plans but I sold it for a fair bit of caps so I guess I cant really complain
---
Well if they keep it up I’ll get the game Once it drops to like 20.
---
Yes it’s just my luck but I have tested this many times by moving points in and out of luck. I got my BE pump shotty when I had ONE luck point. 
---
Max luck affects the durability of the items you pick up, it’s great to have an item that has a very long condition bar because it means better durability and less repair for the buyer. It makes perfect sense for shop owner/pro farmer to max out their luck.
---
Press X once your in the repair modify thing
---
-xbox1
---
I mean i just paid 5k caps for an imposter set, how much did u sell for?
---
Thinking for player vending. Have a community exchange next to machine.
---
Same here; I name them in capslock too. Ex:
---
* *LVL 30 HUNTING RIFLE
---
* *LVL 25 HANDMADE RIFLE
---
Great info, thanks!  
---
**Question(s):**   
---
-Was there lag during the encounter? (aka could the count be delayed?)  
---
-Do you use the "Power User" perk, which increases the duration of the cores for Gatling Plasma's and Lasers.   
---
-Great details....  Can you try and reproduce with (1) core in your inventory, curious if it's related to the change in core usage (lowest to highest)
---
I noticed that the normal button to repair now brings up another menu with the option to "workshop repair" that should be what you're looking for
---
Thanks.... maybe I was just stupidly unlucky
---
Thanks
---
That is, and I know this is going to suck, working as intended.  
---
You have to fire it after charging or loose the benefit.
---
Ah sorry I forgot. All my special points are in...uh...do I even have special points? Didn't put the in strength, endurance, agility. Intelligence is average I guess, no charisma, or luck. 
---
Is there an 8th special stat where all my points are hiding?
---

I've had the same person listed on the lower left of my screen all evening.  I've been server hopping to do the new event, and it stays there whenever I am in game.  Just constantly on.  No noise, just the indicator.
---
It's as if the person's mike is queued on all the time, but the person is no longer in my game.
---
I goes away (if I remember correctly) if I log all the way out of the game.  So far, only 1 name sticks, and I'm not really sure what makes it stick.
---
I must admit this is somewhat speculative given that I have no hard evidence of the phenomenon, merely a with vs without and before vs after subjective 'impression' but it would seem to me that:
---
- Class Freak does nothing to mitigate the negative side effects of Speed Demon. The rate at which hunger/thirst increases on a 'toon' with the mutation vs one without seems - it is truly hard to establish with any degree of certainty when we do not have numbers, just bars, wish someone would mod that in - the full 50% (which I interpret as 1.5x) rather than the appropriate 12.5% (1.125x) with 'lvl 3' of this perk equipped.
---
- Since the release of Wild Appalachia the rate at which hunger/thirst increases has gone up 'a notch'.
---
Seems to me that keeping them 'topped up' in order to keep the benefits of Well Fed/Hydrated up has become tedious busy work.
---
There is no shortage of consumable solids/fluids in this game which is why the constant eating/drinking is just a plain chore vs more scarce sources coupled with more contained increase rates which could be construed as a 'challenge'.
---
Either way without means to produce actual numbers is tricky to leave the realm of speculation with these matters.
---
The whole game feels quiet imo. Have to max volume as other games being on 30, blows my eardrums.
---
That would be cool. Anything not picked up will end up with prize bot. One star drills go to insultbot to give as an insult.
---
Yep.  I found my gear but I almost lost two of my favorite weapons.
---
(USA "monoglot" here so be patient!)  
---
By Accents do you mean what we would see as alternative characters (lower case "e" with a squiggle over it for example)
---
Not gotten to that stage, mind giving me some more details, location etc, maybe a screenshot of the map location?
---
They are a world drop. Your best best is to try to get it from Event: Patrol Duty.
---
 Oh my. I thought you hunted Scorchbeasts for food. Silly of me. ;)
---
*Shrug*  
---
Not trying to cause drama, stating the facts as reported by the players.  
---
It's standard help desk dialog to deflect if it's a vague issue.
---
Uh? They DID post about it. They said your account is suspended. 
---
https://amp.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/arhr4a/login_failed_this_account_is_not_authorized_error/egqm87p/?context=1000
---
This is one of multiple.
---
Yeah "Shopping Mall Vendor" is Watoga. [Look how they massacred my bot.](https://imgur.com/gallery/xgcLhCD)  
---
They massacred the flair of the Whitesprings by just randomly tossing the bots in there. Could have called them " John - Raider Representative Vendor" or something like that. But nah, nameless bots it is.  
---
Hopefully in the coming weeks and months, they get a facelift and a new lick of paint.. And a personality.. *Please!!*
---
The fact that you don't understand such a simple concept is beyond me. If my gun breaks while defending my workshop, and they guy attacking has his gun break but can fix it because he has a repair kit that he bought, he will win because he paid. Hence the term pay to win. I guess some people prefer ignorance over reality.
---
I must disagree. And I basically stopped playing in part also because of how much re-speccing I need to do.
---
I'm on xb1, my buddy has the plans. I'm sure he would if you have the materials.
---
I really feel like B shouldn't be the confirm scrap button though. Maybe you should have to hold a button or just hit something else like Y or a bumper. Anything but B
---
Savage lol ...i like it
---
Days? It started a day ago. It was busy yesterday but I've not seen another player today while doing it on alts.
---
It actually did for a while, but I'm happy to include this in my Perks issue.  
---
Would you mind posting it here?  
---
[Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup - Perks - Feb 2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/apoowq/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_perks/)   
---
Going to make a new page soon'ish, if I've got it there I'll remember to include it in the next Perk page I make.
---
as far as i know VATS does not use ADS features. so the damage bonus seems to be moot.
---
\+10% aiming damage is best for non vats stuff, like big guns IMO
---
In Power Armor or Standard armor?  
---
Have you tried repairing them?
---
"Gutted" aye? What's the slang yer speaking?
---
 I think you have to stuff it in one of the holes. I'd start on the bigger one to the north and try them all.
---
Yeah I still get frequent stutters while just roaming, seems like it has to do with rendering objects as they come into view. It very well could be my internet, 18 down/2 up, but ping is always pretty decent (its more or less dedicated to the PC and a PS4). 
---
I mean I suppose my specs are a few years old at this rate, but pretty sure somebody shouldn't have to get a 2080 to avoid stutters :p
---
I’m at the westernmost, already have my camp places it just won’t let me spawn in the tunnel.
---
Thanks...Could you give me some more details so I can try and Replicate?   
---
-Perks effecting DMG.  
---
-Armor  
---
-Weapon  
---
-Mutations (all of them please)
---
You know those kids that come up to you in game and regardless of how much you ignore them they try and tried with you? It’s the best way to deal with them. Just start blowing up cars around you and they will leave you alone.
---
How do I start the event?
---
Yeah, it feels a lot more deserted now.. The moment the Faction bots were added to Whitesprings, it's almost like there was a mass exodus of players from there area.  
---
Only time I've seen players around the Whitesprings Vendors &amp; Faction reps was when a nuke had been dropped. Easy way to sell and get back to the grind at least.
---
It would be neat if a player can swap unused perk points for additional SPECIAL point slots. Say if you save 100 unused perk points you can swap them for one Additional point slot. So a level 350 player can have three more SPECIAL points than a 50 level, if he saved all his points since level 50 that is.
---
no, PvP is enabled during events if people are not passive
---
Have you tried to restart the quest?
---
Yeah that’s definitely something that should be addressed even just coming across a 3 star Legendary in the wild is pretty rare and it sucks when you just get a 1 star from it
---
 Yeah that could be difficult. We don't have a precise CAMP spawn point yet.
---
The crossbow has been saving my life recently as I’ve found myself in areas that are higher level than I am, and I run out of bullets for all of my guns. I’m going to have to rename it to “Ol Reliable” after the amount of Yao Guai and Glowing Ones its killed (killed meaning I sat on a roof and shot them with sneak attack damage over a course of 15 minutes each).
---
I am having the same problem.  If I look at each piece individually in the Pipboy, it shows the skin.  But in 3rd person, it doesn't show.  It's also not craftable on the Power Armor rack.  And even more weird, it shows up in the Atom store as purchasable, it doesn't show that I already own it.  Really strange.
---
On top of that itd be nice if when you go to the actual camp place thing to repair it,  if they would make to where it could repair everything you can eith the materials you have
---
Odd.....  
---
How are you getting to 144 refresh rate (edit wise), hardware overrides or INI edits?
---
Lmao damn I killed one and got it and not on purpose 😂
---
At this rate they will be ready for a winter holiday release! I can't wait!
---
What Underarmor are you wearing?   
---
Wondering if the bug related to that crept back in.
---
Yeah... I'm calling bullshit on this one.
---
It's easy to farm for. 
---
1. Place camp on an acid node or take an acid workshop.
---
2. Excavator armor and lucky hole mine for lead.
---
3. Break down all weapons for steel.
---
4. Ammosmith +super duper +chemist
---
Understand that I run the mine slowly. So in 1 hours worth of work I get enough lead or for just about 2k lead scrap. 1k steel scrap. And plenty of paperplus my acid to make gunpowder. On average I farm enough in 1 hour to make 20k 50cal ammo. ( With procs from ammosmith and supper dupper. So if that's the ONLY baliat weapon you have your set. People that I know do the same in 30 min or less and server hop to reset the mine. It's not hard to keep in ammo but it's tedious to do sometimes. Hope this helps
---
Bait
---
You should store a bulk of your water and only carry like 10 with you
---
Ok thanks!
---
Oh yeah, cap dump to the tune of 1,400 caps without ever setting foot at the Whitesprings Resort. Whoops!
---
The excavator is a tank.  Hardly ever have to repair it.
---
Thanks for taking the time to document!  
---
1)If this happens again could you grab a screenshot of your active effects and special stats?  
---
2) Uranium Fever has been a little erratic since Patch 6, sometimes non-stop spawns and other times only a few / nothing but the Legendaries....  I'd include it in non-Patch 8 page.
---
Lmao true
---
Patch 6 related, they still haven't fixed the issues caused by their edits to the leveled lists.
---
5k for just the helmet, this was yesterday though, about 4 or 5 hours after the event dropped, I know a lot of people paid 10k or more for the helmet an hour or two afterwards, sold the mascot head for 1k today and will hopefully sell the fedora for like 500 or so
---
This crap happens every friggin' update, they find out what players are farming or enjoying and nerf the crap out of it. For every good thing they do, theres always some behind the scenes nerf that sucks whatever enjoyment back out of it. I wish more people would ask for a single player mode, they made survival mode, they could definitely do it, but they want to join the multiplayer deathmatch battle royale fortnite bandwagon, the only thing keeping me playing is this is the only fallout were going to get for a long while, fallout 5 is years away. here's hoping the datamined 4 horsemen power armors are released and some half decent quests as well, otherwise I think a lot of people are gonna bail on this game...
---
They were removed from the pool some time ago...
---
Question, does the issue stop if you get kicked from your team?
---
Question, do they eventually load, just delayed?
---
What platform are you on?
---
It’s really good. Hopefully this post is getting the message out that crossbows need more mods. 
---
Like the name.
---
You able to make this exchange?
---
*nod*  Older bug, started a few patches ago, but is seriously annoying, I'll try to include in my next "Weapons" roundup
---
same issue for me in putting x01 calibrated shocks mod onto x01 legs i crafted
---
Would've been useful a month ago when I accidentally scrapped one of my best armor pieces...
---
X01 no mods. Totally stock
---
I run aderenline and gunfu to clean up adds and hold the pylon near the cabin so that theres less of a clow fiesta
---
 Won't kill me, but I like your style. ;)
---
Hmmmmmm   
---
This seems to be a larger issue, and would explain the reports of suddenly overloaded....    
---
Need more info just not sure where to start.  
---
**Questions:**   
---
-Are you seeing this all the time or just after logging in?  
---
-PA or Armor?  
---
-Have you un-equipped and re-equipped all perk cards since the patch?
---
This might be useful, all the Legendary effects and a bunch we may (or may not!) see. 
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_76_legendary_weapon_effects
---
Upper-management .... High table! a weapons free zone, while you do business on Conten-... Whitesprings grounds.. Break those rules, and its excommuni-... The Vendors turn on you.
---
The only thing that seems to work is logging out and reloading.

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
I stuck my camp next to there for the new event - had four brood mothers pop up and the first three were blown up by my turrets (this does not count apparently). Got the forth on my own luckily.
---
How dare you criticize something in a sub that's devoted to it! Don't you know this is happy town and all posts must blindly praise this turd of a game?
---
True. I've killed it probably 3 times now and not gotten anything higher than a 1 star. Its all been armor, too.
---
Thanks for reporting, question before I post / move forward...  
---
Is this happening specifically related to something or a location?  
---
Aka is it happening right after logging in and you fast travel or fast traveling to a specific location?
---
Regular armor, totally repaired.
---
if they keep all the vendors in the white springs. id love it if they had more "personality" 
---
each vendor could be like their main versions, as well as some commentary about the white springs
---
Raider - rude and sassy. may also smack and destroy any Mr. Handy that gets too close.
---
Responder - acts nice, appreciates being there
---
Free States - skeptical of the white springs, claiming the place smells of government control
---
BOS - has a backpack with some tech sticking out of it, and an eyebot companion. claims the white springs could be a good source of Technology for collection.
---
"Shopping Mall" (Watoga) - just is there to sell stuff
---
Its easy to hide a rifle in your pants. Just claim you have a large dick.
---
It has not been in previous fallout games. In fallout 1,2 and *shudders* tactics. Luck had very specific effects in some scripted events,and using the virtual dice and critical chance. But honestly those three were so different. It wouldn't even be valid to compare them to modern games systemically. 
---
In 3 and NV it boosted skills base by luck/2, and boosted critical chance per point.
---
In fallout 4 it increased critical charge rate and allowed you to pick up higher luck perks.  The extra loot of caps and ammo came from perks not luck itself. 
---
In fallout 76, it effects critical charge rates and the condition, and only the condition of dropped items. 
---
You're just bias because you're confusing real world "luck" with the ingame stat luck.
---
Topside of Blackwater mine, east of white springs
---
Hey, if the player in the bus was level 12 or so, then telling them how to stop the bots attacks would be warranted. But you said the player was level 70, they should know the Whitesprings is a neutral zone as far as bots are concerned. The enclave mission basically tells you to go there and you constantly run into bots there. I can imagine a newbie being nervous around so many bots, seeing as you have a few shooting at you early in the game, but level 70? I'd be one of the vultures most likely if I showed up there too.
---
I didn’t even know the game had rad storms until today. Because of reddit. Not cause I saw one lol
---
I've played for like 130 hours and haven't seen a rad storm. I almost don't believe they exist lol
---
For me it's not Alpha sorting at all, which would make sense...  
---
Worse it seems to be erratic account to account
---
Dense mod on Torso + Fireproof 3 + high damage mitigation.
---
You keep blowing up vehicles, I keep shrugging them off.
---
Not that I would 'try it on' with anyone, not my 'thing', but blowing stuff up is not as cracked up as it used to be.
---
Also my mistake. Doesn’t make me over carry weight just drops my carry weight by 40 when I put PA on
---
It’s super discouraging when he explodes and you can’t find the body after dying like 30 times to his bs one shot melee lol
---
*Oh my god, YES!!!*   
---
That would have made perfect sense, to be perfectly honest.. But if I remember correctly. The Resort had gone into a lockdown state, which shut off access to certain areas of The Whitesprings Resort.
---
The Vendor inventories reset every so often, so it's possible you checked after an reset did occur, I personally have gotten some off them post patch
---
I’ve done it once and we demolished it , what’s happening in your games ?
---
Yup.
---
By showing others what he's doing wrong with a link, you'd be causing him to lose views in the long run, not gain them. I'm curious about your claims of a recent video but I wouldn't just take an internet stranger at their word and am definitely not gonna sit through his videos until I find a fitting comment.  :-p
---
I'd say reconsider your position, but your call.
---
......what?
---
PlayStation 4
---
Right and that was my whole point.  Whatever faults the old system had I think this one is worse.
---
Yeah for real.. This is just as dangerous but in a different way lol.
---
&gt;Yada Yada favorite weapon are you sure?
---
Oh, shit! No no no cancel! *presses B*
---
&gt;*Thank you for confirming. Destruction of your favorite weapon is imminent.*
---
Great example, thanks, adding and crediting.
---
[Look how they massacred my bot!](https://imgur.com/gallery/xgcLhCD)
---
Census violence just awarded me the shielded lining plan
---
they should just have removed all dupes, no mercy
---
Thanks!  
---
have it documented and reported, got flooded with this one via report and PM
---
Yeah, I haven't really gone back. I just visit my main Vendor bot Phoenix in Watoga. Lol
---
Thanks but it rarely happens now that I have a proper spec and a 3* axe.  But before getting to that point I saw it a lot.
---
What dont you understand?
---
Some one that hasn't found a legendary one yet? 
---
Seriously I can't get a Legendary Hunting rifle or Handmade to save my life, so I know that pain.
---
Barn does it as well
---
O\_O..   
---
Yes, I love the patch. But there are some overbearing issues.. or in this case.. Repetitive dialogue issues and such.
---
I think that was changed to avoid some of the clipping problems that were occurring.  
---
Try changing the order you wear the items and they might appear (let me know!)
---
Does moving the camp device move the spawn?
---
&gt; been playing since beta 
---
same except I have never seen one :/
---
bro this is the whole point of RNG.
---
if you want a game where you get things go play something else.
---
WHY does everyone Bitch and moan about the drop rates for things.
---
the point of RNG is just that Random, its a thrill when you goto a legendary and wait to see what you'll get weather its shit or good isn't the point its the hunt thats great.
---
if all 3\* enemy's dropped 3\* loot all the time and if you changed the combination % then the world would be flooded with rare and great legendary s meaning they are no longer rare and great.
---
They become mediocre like tse weapons were at one stage.
---
Yeah, I had a look this morning and it seems like even the original Whitesprings Vendors don't seem to sell mods anymore either.. Which is rather odd.
---
Well, I guess it's s step to right direction.
---
God I have personally reported this over a dozen times, (and thanks for piling on!)  
---
I'm a freaking Raider and it kills me I can't get a Pipe Revolver.  
---
I've got it on the last Weapon's Round up page I made, and will include it (and submit it again) when I make the next!
---
Sounds like the same issue. It always resets to 2/4 for me and I can look at one of the bikes to get it to 3/4 but that's it.
---
The display only shows two digits but sometimes things weight 0.001.  Like Bobby Pins.
---
I didn’t start playing regularly again till this patch was released so that would make sense why I never saw  any plasma bolts in the air, I started I’m using the plasma Gatling a little after I got back into the fray.
---
They should do it the way for honor does it.
---
In for honor during an event you can get free event loot drops after any match, but theres obvs the paid for stuff
---
the bundle includes everything free and purchasable, get all free items, buy one or two things and the price of the bundle goes down
---

id completely forgotten about this disaster
---
I got lucky and saw 2 in the first week and than nothing until last month
---
Do you really think someone hiding in a bus from WS security is equipped in such a way? I seriously doubt that.
---
Love it, karma is peek fallout.  It could determine prices at certain faction vendors and give you access to different events.  Raider events for evil people, Responder events for good people, etc.  lots of possibilities.  Track it based on which events you do and the more you skew in either direction your rewards go up down down.  Evil people get less for responder events than raider events along with exclusive raider events.
---
Thank you!!!!
---
What does eso mean
---
Power Armor:  
---
Could you give me some more details?  
---
Could not replicate when i tried (had 6 frames)  
---
Trading issue:  
---
Forgot about that one, THANKS!  
---
Weapon:  
---
Known issue, will include in my next Weapons Roundup page!  
---
Thanks for reporting all of this!
---
&gt;so let's not neuter the game completely
---
When someone complains about PVP in survival, a common answer is, "If you don't like it, go play in adventure."  Hey that's completely reasonable.   
---
But when I  tell someone "If you want PVP go play in survival," I get massively down voted and told no this simply will not do.  Why is that?
---
Elder scrolls online
---
A bunch of those adds are high level legendaries, they're idiots
---
No lag, it occurred instantly as soon as I shot the 250th charge (from a gatling plasma) and somewhere around that for the laser. 
---
I don't think I even have the power user perk, I'm always swimming in cores until I actively try to waste them and never even considered taking it. 
---
Didn't try it with 1 core, but I used up most of my fusion cores from the gatling laser fighting a scorchbeast queen right now (got a syringer from her btw, very happy about that). The laser continued to completely unload every time a core got used up, which became more frequent when I dropped down to &lt;5. I died to an unarmed scorched because I had to spin it up, shoot a single laser, spin up again, shoot maybe a hundred lasers into a crowd, reload, repeat.
---
Exactly.  I just leave CC on now,
---
Yup. After my initial comment I went in and checked and that's what is happening to me. I even tried throwing a grenade in case the holotape was magically hidden in the ground and needed a gentle push.
---
Ok thanks
---
It’s happened after logging in, after fast traveling, and after dying and respawning. So far at the whitesprings golf club, train station, the encryptid event, and fissure prime that I can recall.
---
I'll try to replicate, and hopefully someone else will chime in (Don't doubt, just helps to have a few people provide different perspectives if I can't do it)
---
Welcome
---
All of it?
---
Ugh.. Documenting
---
Perhaps because he wants to try PvP out without it ruining his character completely? He said he's primarily a PvE player, not totally anti-PvP. I'm the same way. I want to occasionally play a riskier game mode, and try my luck against other players, without being spawn camped by a cheeseball with a duped legendary, draining all my caps entirely.
---
Hell yes! That skin is just SICK! Can't wait to Cadillac it in my XO-1 with that skin!
---
\*\*\*\*\*
---
Whatever happened to the other cool PA skins in a prior datamine?
---
If you're on xbox I'll buy that or trade it for something you might want.
---
I ended my Fallout 4 game sitting on a bench in front of the Castle in the middle of a rad storm. I have only experienced 1 or 2 radstorms and it was while I was building my camp up, so I didn't really pay attention.
---
I cant help you then
---
...what
---
Yeah, I did notice that. At least the Responders got a little paint job.. Which is nice, I guess? Lol but still.. the others feel so bland and out of place.
---
you can obviously do it again for better stuff
---
Then good sir run into people on reddit still bashing a game...i assume your still playing and bad mouthing it... enjoy that your problems are getting addressed and have fun .. stop all the....this is how it used to be... enjoy the now
---
Nullifying all legendary effects in Survival is a great idea.
---
Honestly I think it wasnt the actual account owner but probably either the kid of the real one or the girlfriend. Seemed to be panicking and surprised at having the option to leave the server despite being in combat.
---
Oh. Didn’t know you could repeat it.
---
So you are the good guy for not standing there taking screen shots but also not helping?  Maybe we need to talk about sociopathic behaviours, too?
---
"having ran into the inferno of issues we all did"
---
Take it down a notch. :-p  I didn't have that many problems with this game during either beta or launch, no need to generalize your experience to every other person.
---
Also the OP isn't blindly saying how great it is. They're saying they really enjoy the game despite problems... which frankly is how a lot of people approached it during beta/launch period. The Filthy Casuals sub alone has 10k+ people who can attest to that!
---
Huh didnt know that
---
There is the Vault Tec Jumpsuit, which is the closest you'll get probably.
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Vault-Tec_jumpsuit
---
Nah man they're in My Documents/My Games/Fallout 76/Photos/\*RANDOMLY NAMED FOLDER\*
---
No worries. I think I can figure out how to make a video if you can’t replicate the issue. Let me know if you can’t and if not I’ll give it a shot and post a link.
---
Fellow quad automatic tesla rifle user here, I have not gotten to the event yet but I am sure to start saving up fusion cells for this
---
Well that's weird thought it worked like that before.
---
I get the mall idea but would have preferred a different spot altogether still in the middle of the map. 
---
What I'd like to see is a little town and each faction with a storefront that fits their personality.  
---
A Main Street..........
---
It would also help with the enormous amount of lag.
---
Remember Diamond City in FO4. That should be the trading hub here as well.
---
Hmm, was yesterday the very first day of survival? No? Ok, was the character a new low level just starting? 400 purified water make me think no. Have there been numerous posts on other player's losses since the start of Survival mode? Freaking tons. So you can't say you didn't know the possibility of having some form of loss unless you're some God tier weapon toting, ultra durable armor wearing, ass kicking machine. So, what I'm saying  is 'Well, duh, don't take in 400 purified water into Survival'
---
How much damage is it? Is it elemental damage, or the "bleed" damage that ignores resistances?
---
I'm sure it would suck.Only using 15 out of 50 available points,How do you suppose that would work out?
---
Good for pvp unless the other player hasn't updated his or her archive list yet. Making the peerly peepers hard pink just like other new items.
---
Got to the end of the quest. He never appeared :/
---
Lol I’m actually serious
---
oh man, thanks so much &lt;3
---
I don't get the logic here. You can't have the same legendary spawn rate as a game like Destiny when you have 1,000x the amount not legendary drops. It's fucking boring without legendary spawns.
---
I got a pet [sheep](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/114735378392416265/565703692859211776/unknown.png) from the boss so I'd say it was worth it.
---
Power Armor: 
---
I can't really replicate it to be honest. It will just happen randomly. Whether I'm server hopping or whatever the case may be.
---
Last night when I logged off.. I had "Quantum X-01" and "Excavator PA". Today when I got on - I took my Excavator PA out, then recalled it a few mins later and went to take out my "Quantum X-01". Just to find they were both named "Excavator PA". 
---
I've also just seen it happen while not being in my PA. So I'm not sure if it's a mixture of getting in and out of it - or what. Almost like the server still looks at "Power Armor Chassis" behind the scenes and then when it's queued to pull the Custom Name - it grabs the wrong one.
---
#ALSO! I have another one I forgot about - I added it above.
---
 Whenever you rename the Ultracite Power Armor to literally "Ultracite Power Armor" it will capitalize the entire name to show "ULTRACITE POWER ARMOR". So I had to switch to "Ultracite PA". I'm more wondering if just having "Power Armor" in ANY Chassis Title will do this - rather than only being associated with Ultracite.
---
:) I will add anymore bugs I find!
---
That doesn’t work, if you destroy the vehicle then the damage is considered damage from you, and he will take zero damage.
---
Just completed this quest today. Had been searching for weeks, never seeing a golfer goul. Once I put on the golf outfit outfit with faded visor I started seeing unruly golfers. I did have to server jump 3 times. Found 2 on first server, 7 on the next and my last one on my third server jump. Don't know if this matters or not, but once I looted their corpses I got credit for the kills. Found al of them north of the circle, where the shops, historic house and the rooms you can get in without an ID card. Oh and I was level 43 at the time. Hope this helps :)
---
yeah seems to be a common issue, couldn't mod some weapons today as well. I think it has mainly to do with mods you bought, because if you learned them from plans or scrapping it's working fine.
---

---
Hey relax. It's not a limited time event.  Maybe just step away from it for a while until the newness wears off in a week or so.
---
As soon as you look on the computer it usually disappears.  The event is the end of it if I’m correct!
---
The High-Table has a bounty out on your head.. :P
---
same here.  Very anti-climactic. Just nothing... not even a mission complete display...just nothing...  
---
Wtf is wrong with Bethesda these days?
---
I marked down Watoga Train as where I found heavy combat armor Legs. so start there.  BoS mod can be found at grafton steel rarely at the armor plan spawn.
---
Weird, what platform?
---
That’s fine but it doesn’t change the fact. You can disagree all you want but doesn’t make you right.
---
Didn't ask you to? 
---
I haven't played ESO in years, but I do not see many if any similarities.
---
Agreed entirely. More loot is definitely needed going forward
---
I did notice that as well, I even checked the Whitesprings vendors and they aren't selling mods at all either. Which is rather odd.
---
Do you wear standard armor with Weight Reduction effects?
---
Sooooo.... Bethesda is untrustworthy, trust Bethesda will release it to private server.  Got it.
---
It’ll pop up in the top right corner when someone triggers it and you can join on them!  Just like the Fasnacht stuff did.
---
Whaaat?   I said or did nothing wrong
---
Thanks, will document and report.

Fertile soil is quick don’t bother with enclave events they didn’t count for me and I’m not sure if that was just me
---
Im enjoying it so far
---
Ok so that’s the only time u can use a card? Or when it pops up someone started it?
---
distant thunder can be completed in less than two minutes. don't scope them. just kill all the scorched.
---
Haha, yeah I posted that video. It sucks bethesda made these changes, but we just have to roll with it and figure out new ways to break the game
---
Well no i wasnt taking screenshots, and i did not "help" as in combat the robots because as i said that would cost me ammo and stimpaks which isnt something im willing to invest if the other option is "help" as in teaching/reminding someone about a basic game mechanic (switchting servers) which costs me nothing.
---
Im not claiming im a "good guy", hell i wrote in the post that i laughed when i saw the scene. Im merely saying that some extremely petty behaviour of waiting for someone to die or being angry when someone helps another person out and your "entertainment" is gone, is something that the community should discuss.
---
Seriously! In bethesda we trust!  They will do this!
---
I set iPresentInterval=0 in my ini.
---
Mine dropped 32 rounds of .45 ammo
---
I understand your perspective but don't forget the loading time for fast travel is usually around 30 -45 seconds most of the time which means you spend sooo long on just loading screens when your fast traveling to vendors to dump crap for caps.
---
Also it's quite rare to see players under level 50 these days, They get a few here and there but most of the ones I have spoken to are players on either a second build or a mule account. Bethesda aren't really getting a ton of new players so the people who are playing now are most likely the ones who will be playing in 6 months time, Most people have already explored the entire map which isn't that big really (only took me 11 minutes to walk from one side to the other) 
---
Bethesda are making what was a very boring and time consuming part of the game much quicker and easier which I honestly appreciate.
---
Yeh it's not exactly pretty the way it's done, personally I think with the size of Whitesprings they could have set up some new shops instead of just dumping them where they are.
---
Also I would rather they focus on fixing things then setting up a pretty little area for vendors, they can be done later once the game is a lot less glitchy.
---
sill happening, doing the new event for sheepsquach and cant respawn to claim loot
---
If you don’t want to waste your own card you can wait it out until it pops up.  Not sure if anyone has figured out the exact cooling period but it seems to be a while.  Just carry on your way and wait for it if you don’t want to waste your card!  They’re hella expensive if you use yours and don’t beat the event.
---
thanks for the tip, some of these challenges are a pain.  maybe there could be a sticky in the sub for daily/weekly challenges where tips like this can be easily found!
---
In a sense, I wouldn't say *"Yank them."*  But give them a proper spot in Whitesprings, not just put willy nilly in with the other Vendors. It doesn't make much sense to me.
---
Who was making the claim it should be?
---
Same here.  My CAMP workbench screens all go blank when I attempt to modify/repair. I can click x to repair, but the left hand screen goes blank and I can not see the stats anymore.  WTH?  Need to fix so I can see the stats before I attempt to modify/repair.  On Xbox.
---
And im saying id like it to stay that way
---
really? first time i heard that
---
completed the event like 6 times so far never got such a drop.
---
It is basically a [ranged stealth build with some damage avoidance](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f495b9&amp;d=lt2sg2a72ar2an2ao0a00pd2pk2pl2pe2ic4eh2c72cm2pp2li2lg2e00cu0cr0&amp;w=&amp;n=Ranged%20Sneak%20Tank&amp;m=). Nothing too fancy. I'm considering maybe moving 3 points of PER over to AGI so I can run White Knight all the time. Not sure. But thats it basically.
---
As for hand-me-downs, I appreciate the offer, but I sort of want to see what I can manage to accomplish solo. I'd like to do some of the vendor scumming and the horde events to see if I can come up with anything. Just for giggles. So no worries on gear, I'll see what drops.
---
Thanks tho!! Much appreciated.
---

---
The rest of the subreddit?
---
I like the idea of them trying to make shitesprings a social hub, what I don't like is how they literally just threw the workshops in the mall so they should change the storefronts to match the vendors or use a different area for a social hub
---
Yeah that’s what I’ll have to do. It’s just annoying. Really hope the next fallout is single player
---
You don't have to redo the whole quest, just final event. You can craft the recall card at workbenches
---
I think it is suppose to come out on a different update like a second part to the new dlc but idk
---
👍
---
Oh I know where that is, I have a house on the pond with one of my alts!
---
My guess is you have to mimic its mating rituals.  It was a big joke, but maybe it’s a hint &gt;.&gt;
---
This is an issue not exclusive to '76  
---
Many PC Players have to use a external limiter, setting it to about 10 FPS below the Max, both on GSync and FreeSync displays.  
---
It also seems more common when played in "Windowed" (Borderless) mode.  
---
Give it a try and let me know if it helps.
---
It's for performance, It will probably go up again at some point but 800 is a lot better than the 400 we got at launch (I think they said at one point it would be unlimited lol)
---
Some recent posts include people asking for changes and saying "ESO does it."
---
They work fine for me are you in PA
---
Days, as in plural, it’s been two nights (plural) and I’ve been trying to do this mission. And your experience hasn’t been mine obviously
---
Yeah, that's what I gathered, I just hope this quest line will continue or that the real Sheepsquatch will show up in some way, if not I am gonna be really irritated with Bethesda for cheaping out at the last moment and putting a fake sheep helmet on an Assaultron.
---
Thanks, Documenting and reporting
---
If you want to do a quick wave, walk along and wave, you do a nice little salute type wave. You can even do this with a weapon equipped. 
---
Good suggestions, hope they add stuff like this. Me and my friends like just hanging around at camp.
---
You have a pve build if a tse is messing you up first problem. Second problem there are no one shots in pvp. Third problem anything is better than power armor in pvp. Dont use pve gear and perks and expect to stand a chance.
---
I've had this since about 5 days ago
---
&gt; It essentially breaks lore   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The entire premise of the game is lore breaking. It's supposed to be many years before Fallout 3 in the timeline.  Do you remember any terminal entries at the Citadel in Fallout 3 referencing Paladin Taggerdy and the scorched beasts? No? That's because there were none.  Calling that problematic from a lore perspective is being generous.
---
whats pa?
---
How can they even "break" ? They are not armor but clothing.
---
Shame, I'm on PC
---
I'm glad you told the person how to get out of it.  It sounds to me like it was someone borrowing their sibling\significant other's account to try out the game and didn't really know everything about how the game works.  
---
That no one else would even try to help in any way is just wrong.  I don't blame you for not wanting to waste ammo or get the whole area after you.  You really did the only thing that you could to help the player.  I would have done the same thing having the same options.
---
Problem is when things are “stuck” in a spot and you can’t store it until you tear down everything attached to it, or I’ll frequently have things placed in tight spots which would mean having to move a bunch of stuff to put it back.
---
Well at least we can play Anthem...
---
Didn't know it only went up that high lol
---
🤷‍♂️
---
&gt;As for hand-me-downs, I appreciate the offer, but I sort of want to see what I can manage to accomplish solo. I'd like to do some of the vendor scumming and the horde events to see if I can come up with anything. Just for giggles. So no worries on gear, I'll see what drops.
---
I respect wanting to get your own stuff. That said, If you want a partner to go kill stuff for a bit or run uranium fever just shot me an invite. My GT is the same as my reddit name.
---
I made a new build fully based around high Damage resistance I still get 1 shotted it’s pretty dumb that if you don’t have specific gear that’s pretty rare it kinda becomes almost unplayable if you p
---
Sounds like you’re a bit butthurt someone killed you with a grenade.
---
In my experience what you’re saying is not true. I’ve never been killed by a grenade going through a world object, but I have been saved several times by running behind a world object for cover from a plasma/pulse/cryo grenade.
---
Haha! Still would've gone full blown Raider myself. And then feel bad, until a glowing Deathclaw comes along, and then it's business as usual.
---
Been doing a lot of events and so far I only notice the killing happening after the event ends.
---
It's just not worth the time, ammo and stimpacks, or even the caps to travel when the events hits.
---
&gt;Really hope the next fallout is single player
---
You and me both.
---
Not sure how to prove this, but I've noticed an increased number of crashes when successfully picking a lock. Multiple times this evening as soon as a door or container was unlocked the game would instantly crash to desktop. Odd for sure
---
Wait, what? This is a fucking game changer.
---
Holy shit, I didn't realize how broken this is now. Probably the most game breaking bug right now.
---
Hoenstly youd be surprised how many times a hard restart (not just hitting restart but shutting down then booting up again) has help. Its ussually just performance issues but its always worth a try.
---
Also I don't think that perks count toward items in stash.
---
I'm not sure if this is a bug or not, but I had a character up to the I am becomes death  point where you have to get the code piece, keycard, and then launch however since the patch this quest is now grayed out like it is completed. I tried going to the terminal to start the search for the code piece and a keycard which worked fine but that final mission  is grayed out.   
---
It's not that big a deal because it's one of my alts but I'm sure someone that hasn't completed it would be pretty pissed.
---
This is the first I've heard of it
---
Where tf is you camp to be attack from SB
---
Only bad players blame gear. If your on ps4 I'll take off all my armor and show you. Wear or use what ever gear you like.
---
Lucky you
---
Exactly
---
And just think, the guy probably picked it up and then realized how much was there, and dropped most of it. How do I know? I do it all the time with people’s loot, because a lot of people carry way to much of shit they will never end up using.
---
That's a really good tank build gun
---
They only work from the pip boy now
---
I'm having the same problem..  Gonna try YouTube for a fix.  Fingers crossed.  I'll let you know if I find out anything.
---
Because nobody else is playing anymore.
---
What’s your build then? I’m on Xbox
---
I don’t see the same items available. With the stash pool shared I don’t even see the point of the added vendors in the white spring.
---
Its power armor and make sure you comment on the persons comment they dont know youre asking this
---
Hahahah get wrecked cheater
---
why?
---
YES! Just because it’s easier doesn’t mean it’s better! I see so many posts by people with their “cool ideas” that would help them, but they are all just ways to make things easier for them. Sure, it was a pain to travel to each vendor to sell your 200 caps worth, but now it’s too easy. And you’re right, I only made the initial scary trip to Watoga to get to the train station to sell things - but now there’s no point.
---
The above has happened to me on PS4. Sometimes it will also say that I am speaking on Area chat when my mic is off and I'm not making noise.
---
The terminal in the shack explains the mechanics, the last part of the quest will send you there, its where you use the keycard to start it.
---
You are trying to apply it to excavator armor right? Sorry I’ve worked in tech support...always have to ask if the device is plugged in lol.
---
I have Bandicam installed, but it toke so long to start... the event was finished when everything was ready...
---
Lol I thought the exact thing.
---
Fly Swatter (taking down a vertibot) takes about 30 seconds if you've got a Troubleshooter's rifle/heavy weapon.
---
You know as much as we do buddy! 🙂
---
There is a Maintenance and Stability patch happening Tomorrow (The 11th) at 10 am est maybe that'll fix it up.
---
I have no idea
---
That's how it usually went down, but tonight I had 2 instances of players being able to come into the event and start killing people.
---
It was on the same server, and one player in particular was involved in both incidences. During the Mr messenger event he was alone, but during the uranium fever event he had 2 other players with him. 
---
The rest of us doing the events were caught off guard,  because it's not normal and it's chaotic (especially during the uranium fever event).
---
Thats what im talking about i dont fo76 to become fallout online
---
My armor may vary a lot (I'm always trying different armor sets), but I have maxed fireproof.
---
I've seen this too, since Patch 7 on PS4
---
i'll give that a shot, thanks.
---
This is the kind of complete, utter and amazing nonsense the game needs more of. Bravo!
---
He is on a timer- like a 4 hour timer or something silly. You have to server jump or stay on that server for a while- and when you do, I was on the otherside of the map and I got the same boss warning gump you get when you get near the SBQ
---
I wouldn't be surprised if that was caused by bugs in their code (again). I got lvl 20-30 drops from the legendary lvl 38 and 50 bots in Watoga even though my character is lvl 60 and I see no other low lvl players in that area before or after I fast travel there. Some of my legendary gear is lvl 25 and lvl 30 though, but I don't see why that should be a factor.
---
I've just begun the questline, but is the game clear about stuff you need to do? As in if you just pay attention to stuff as you go, I don't need screen wide blinking red text telling me "DO AB THEN CD TO ACTIVATE X". 
---
I like just playing, without going to read a tutorial about how to do any particular thing, but in case there are some pitfalls, THEN I want to read about it in advance, so I won't fall into them or ruin anything. Particularly as I traded pretty much all my caps into a weapon, so I don't have caps to go buy that new chip you can use to reset something. 
---
Most of the stuff is super easy, like when you pick up the bone at the start. "you can give a bone to a dog but can you give bone to a wolf". Okay, I thought there could be a wolf in there. The game so strongly implies going to the basement, that I checked everything else first, then went to basement Well I guess there was a wolf, but I as expecting a serious fight. Most of the stuff I've advanced so far seems cool. 
---
It does make you think, what was the quest all about. I like that. Was he crazy. Unstable. Does the game imply he has schizophrenia?(strictly speaking of course not, but particularly back in the days, I believe it was fairly common misbelief to think schizophrenia as some kind of split personality. Plus the whole consept of split personality is based more on movies stores, than how it actually is)
---
I mean you know from Todd before launch, that there's no human going to alive. So you can't find the said brother, at least not alive. But you go into that loreplay and you are just exploring the stuff left by some dead people years ago for lols, because you, to find out what it was all about. It's really intresting, so far I've figured he might be some kind of near-genius scientist, working on some top-fucking-secret goverment stuff, but also unstable at least, and obsessed with Sheepsquatch stories.
---
German Pew gun for the mg42
---
Man hearing this type of shit makes me feel like putting the game down... like what's the point.
---
It's agility. For the sprint that is.
---
That's pretty odd. I'll be sure to update if I notice anything like that myself
---
My best guess would be that the servers have a cooldown, so that the event can only be triggered, say once every two hours (although this could be any number). Nothing to back it up with other than the fact that neither I nor people I played with could activate it, until one of them randomly could.
---
yeah sorry I can't be more help.  I didn't record where I found the arm and chest plans.
---
Haha OJ was innocent too
---
Could be the next 'burrow' raid update?
---
Sometimes it takes awhile to load. For example if you place it when you enter a world it won’t be there until the items in the world all appear and enemies are invisible. When I log out of the game I put a pip boy radio station on for when I log in. When the radio starts the game is fully loaded.
---
The mods simply said discussing his personal views is okay because he is a public figure, not necessarily because those claims are true.
---
I hope you never become a researcher, because in order to refute views that oppose your own, you need to not only read the arguments against them but be able to show them to others.  Yes, that includes buying access to BS journals.  If you can't cite it exactly, you shouldn't even mention it, because then it basically amounts to speculation or heresy.  And so far, unless there's something I've missed (which is admittedly likely in this long and complicated thread), you are the only person mentioning this one specific reference.  None of the other anti-Oxhorn videos referenced I've looked through have, and you think they'd be all over something like that.
---
You can reject the event to become hostile.
---
I found that out today myself.  Ate a ton of dog food, put on a suit and blew up robots down in watoga till it hit.
---
I'm in where are you?
---

Help me figure out its location/how to obtain lol. Been grinding biv like crazy
---
Maybe, just maybe, they can hotfix the “kill a wendigo while wearing a clown costume” quest
---
Lolz hate much?
---
the worst thing is, the killing was happening during the event, so you restart everytime.
---
I've got luck and finished my challenge few minutes ago. In 20 events, got bad luck in only 2. Maybe those trolls are a lousy minority. Most players want to finish the darn event and go on.
---
About pvp... it's a golden chance to start thinking about factions. Brotherhood would hate raiders (maybe everybody would hate raiders), raiders comes in vast types (I know it's not lore friendly, but I would love to see Nuka World raiders on f76). Other factions would act for their values, and so on!
---
PC for me, been hopping all night, still there.
---
I’m kinda hoping he’s just rare like the Flatwoods monster or mothman and nobody has run into him yet. I’d make him rare, make 3 stars, and a little challenging for the solo player. That’s just me though!
---
how long ago did you find them? i know people were saying they went missing from the vendors after a certain patch.
---
Yeah, VATS :(
---
Based on how the quest (currently?) ends, it'll be pretty obvious what happened to him specifically, but my guess is that they might just elaborate on this questchain further in a soon-to-come update. Or maybe there's already more stuff there that people simply haven't found yet.
---
As for your question, yes. In the game it's very obvious what you have to do. It'll literally tell you in big letters across your screen what to do, as well as the objective in your usual questlog on your right side. If you play a stealth build, it actually messes with your gameplay as you can't tell whether you're discovered or not because of the instructions literally blocking your hidden/caution/danger bar. That being said however, a lot of people still aren't doing the objectives even though it should technically be easy enough to figure out.
---
I have few of them. My current main is a crit high rate of fire build. I also have a bloodied ranged build with balanced with dmg avoidance. Last I have a shot gun pvp build. Dont pvp with out dense chest and fire proof for starters. Try crouching so they have to manual aim, you can kill most players this way before they can force you into vats. Have stagger and crits. Those 3 things will make you a better at pvp than 60% of the players out there with out a single piece of expensive gear.
---
Lolz you should just record this on your phone and broadcast during ingame.
---
Thanks!
---
Had a beaut a couple of weeks back. Sky was green and everything had a green tinge. Took pics will try and post after work.
---
I’m actually very surprised they didn’t do this. The bundles should not be full price if you already own a component. Either they didn’t realize, or they thought we wouldn’t realize. 
---
Another idea would be to not have the bundle items available outside of the bundles. I don’t like that idea, but there is no point of bundles if everything were available separately.

Well when I first put the red and black skin on my excavator armor, the legs disappeared, with calibrated shocks! But reappeared after few frantic minutes of messing with it. Try picking it up, place it a few times. Even go in and out of power armor station a few times. Mine reappeared right before my eyes as if they just weren't loaded yet. But then again this was with the other armor skin. Good luck.
---
I lagged out, it’ll be like 2 minutes and try again. Sorry.
---
I’m diggin the patches but the DCs are killin me.
---
Cool, just sent freind request
---
I doesn't seem like she's cosplaying.  Just a girl getting a burger and Oxhorn filming her from his car.   He does call her a fat Chun-Le tho.  Anyways because of that video i know Oxhorn and I live in the same city.  Which is kinda weird cuz the city is super progressive and I've recently learned Oxhorn is not at all.
---
I noticed a number of people asking for new feats or things from elder scroll online and i dont think turning fallout 76 into fallout online is a great path for this game
---
Do you have Calibrated Shocks on your Excavator Legs?
---
To me it sounds like you do, and then after you exit, they aren't being applied anymore, vs what Alteron\_command said.
---
PS4 here. I have level 50 fixer. Willing to sell 3k. I’m melee user. Anyone interested?
---
I've got a TS .50 call named Ol' Painless and a Zealot's Weightless Bash Damage Minigun named Taggerdy's Revenge.  
---
The name for the minigun is very appropriate.  I got it off a 3* Charred Feral Ghoul at Camp Venture right before 3 SB's attacked me.  I used it to mow them down before going on my way.
---
How do they do this? Is this a common thing now?
---
Saw it for sale. Lvl 30? I like the buffs though.  Plus stealth
---
Brick user here. Same issue.
---
If you got rid of yours, a lot of people have dumped theirs at the Lewisburg station vendor. Just saying..
---
Yep, the damage goes down but heals right back up, and enemies cannot be killed, only melee weapons will be able to do real damage and kill them from that point on.
---
Eh, fat people deserve to be mocked, including Oxhorn.
---
Sounds good, yeah I have been waiting for this to be fixed for so long...
---
If the PvP aspect only applied to a radius, either the workshop owner or the aggressor could abuse it by moving in and out to become vulnerable or invulnerable at will.
---
Yea because the combat rifle runs .45 rounds
---
You didnt spend any real world money. You are whining about 2,000 in game points earned. How about you buy some real atoms. SON
---
I think because most people use legendaries and you already couldn't scrap those.
---
I'm not a dick.  I'm just saying you can't expect others not to be just because you didn't take the time to drop off your junk somewhere first.
---
The final piece is not in the circle..  For me it was a note..  From the den look at the water.  You'll see a rock with some bloodleaf.  Left of it is a log.  There's a note by the end of the log across the river.  If that's not the piece you are missing try YouTube and make sure you got all the pieces leading up to the den.
---
I’d like a roof top garden like the ones in Lewisburg
---
yeah people are exploiting this like crazy, you can just reject the event in your pipboy and tada shout up everyone around. That's why I don't do events in survival atm
---
"these days".
---
Nobody has said... rename power fist to Power Glove
---
Me too just now. Loading up
---
Can confirm everything being said regarding this. I have NO heavy weapon related perks, and just a basic non-legendary Gat Plasma. While fighting SBQ, this was happening every reload. It's not lag related at all, as it happens elsewhere, too. It also isn't spin-up related, as I've tried just quick double-tapping Fire, and it only fires continuously AFTER the weapon has fired **one** shot. Release-fire, and start again, everything is fine.
---
Not OP, but I have the same problem. The quest just straight up vanished from active quests. I was on the step to craft Nukashine.
---
I still have the label in my inventory, and I can get Ingredients Pt. 1 back from Biv. I can also still enter the supply room but Ingredients Pt. 2 never respawns.
---
I've tried re-reading the poster, and I've also tried retracing every single step of the quest to re-trigger it. No dice. Switching servers, restarting the game, and even clearing local save data have not made the quest reappear.
---
I submitted a ticket to Bethesda support and got a useless form response back. Would love some more visibility for this issue since I can't get the brewing station without it.
---
Steven Segal would be proud.
---
Mmm Scorchbeast Brains omnomnom.
---
Just went and tracked it down... and narrowly avoided the level 58 diseased Yao Guai... and the level 35 regular one... I am level 23 and the crossbow was level 15 for me, fwiw.
---
There are a number of variables that go into the SBQ battle, and one of the big ones is how many players are present when she spawns.  If 10 players were standing around from the start, that's going to be a problem.  But if everyone waited, then you shouldn't have too much issue.
---
Leaving Drop Site V6 out of the radiation invites Bloodied players to help, since they normally can't take the radiation of a nuke zone.
---
Having a Cryolator to keep the Queen frozen to the ground helps a lot too.
---
Thanks for this tip - I'm now a proud member of #TeamCrossbow
---
That blows, well of course the challenge this week for survival is to complete events. It's only natural I guess for the shitheads to find a way to exploit this.
---
I dont understand when they now share a cap pool. That was the problem people had and reason they traveled around. To get all their money now having them randomly standing around is just weird and pointless and it now makes more vendors we have to look at to find other players sold items.
---
And, you know, realistic pricing.
---
There is a glitch allowing you to mod one of the ultracite arms with the bone skin
---
Which was a month ago. Since then, they already implemented a patch preventing even holding too many items. So whats the deal?
---
that I didn't write down. It's within the last three patches though
---
I must have missed the patch note that Bethesda released that said three star legendaries are guaranteed to drop three star legendaries. I’m not sure why people want this game to be overly easy. If every 3 star legendary dropped the same star equivalent, what economy do you think we’d have? Who would actually stay around if they had all the top gear handed to them? Let’s face it. Bethesda didn’t go cheap on legendary spawns. Should be greatful for that. Most games you end up having one that might spawn a day and maybe you will get something you can use. To many spoiled kids on this game. To many kids watching YouTube to listen to the complaining they have and annoy people who are fine with the difficulty of the game and want a challenge vs. those who just want an easy game. If it’s so bad, why continue to play? Why not go play Minecraft? The same complaining goes toward pvp. In what post apocalyptic scenario would be sunshine and roses?
---
 You can try moving your CAMP device around inside your CAMP. That can move your spawn point.
---
Well the sheepishly In kinda hoping to be rare but only slightly more rare than a deathclaw
---
same happened to me.  i thought, that was a lame ending.
---
You sure you don't have them "Sorted" by something as well? \*shrug\*
---
Mine are most definitely sorted alphabetically as NotCreativeToday stated, with it ignoring (Known), and going down the name until it hits something different *(in other words, it skips over "Plan:" as well, but that part is by design).*
---
God i hope so man
---
Dang..
---
Nuke Site Alpha is pretty decent, but also common. Twin lakes is also not bad.
---
On my Bloodied build I’ve got some chameleon armour to avoid getting targeted by VATS also with the Adrenal Reaction Mutation and Bloodied effect on my Gauss rifle should be doing around 800+ Damage but in some cases that barely tickles some people, my second character I have a full set of Marine Armour with Dense mod along with Fireproof perk and a lot of the other perks for increasing HP and Damage Resistance I still get melted while my Shotgun does almost nothing, I’m aware Marine armour isn’t the best I believe heavy combat is if I’m not wrong but marine was more available to me
---
We are the testers sadly
---
Straight  South of the train staction by top of the world (I forgot) is a nice location by a river that's reasonably open or you can build near site alpha
---
Bug. Not the first to post about it. No fix yet
---
You should post your platform bud! I’m sure you’ll get people for it. There was a guy not too long ago doing a nightly fight club at his camp and people showed up for that! Just keep the server cap in mind too. Won’t be able to get toooooo big of a crowd going.
---
Maybe its just me but everything seems to just be setup to destroy player morale. As if stuffs not already enough of a grind as it is.
---
its the whole point of RNG people Jeez.
---
Why would people do anything but kill 3\* fucking legendary's if they all dropped 3\* shit.
---
this is whats makes things re playable when you can grind and farm until you get the thing you've wanted.
---
if it was just a giveaway of 3\* shit on 3\* legendary enemy's then the game would be done in 30hrs.
---
We need Hard Bosses good RNG to make things worth doing again and again.
---
Stop Complaining that its too hard or I've  killed a 3\* i need a 3\* item, Get over it and understand the RNG Rule ITS RANDOM for a reason People :).
---
I'm on pc and noticed Breach and Clear spawned very rarely as well. The cheaply Grafton events are still running like clockwork. I wonder if the events that cover areas where the new quest line had their frequency adjusted
---
Definitely not. I've gotten 3 this week.
---
Have you tried contacting their support and asking like they say to? Perhaps you were suspended for something else.
---
As s 47 year old male it gives me hope in society to see people making a stand against hate speech here. Who would of ever thought I'd get that from reddit? Kudos to those who have a moral compass. Ty for giving me some hope.
---
never changed mods.  camo changed after patch.  was playing before patch, gun was correct.  post patch, ugly gun.
---
Says I can't join you
---
?
---
I almost scrapped my pearly peepers because it’s O instead of 📦
---
That's a start
---
RIP shielded vault 76 underarmor I had from lvl 1 to 140
---
Wait, you don't hit x to transfer to your stash? What button so you use?
---
no, i did not.  i paid for black, got it, now i got what i did NOT pay for.
---
Says your offline
---
If I recall, it was 200 at launch.
---
No it was that. I picked up a dropped junk bag full of flux inside a nuked zone. But i didnt cheat it, i just picked up a loot bag. I made a support ticket, but that was about two months ago. Im still waiting.
---
Platform? I just wanna see it
---
Ah.  Friends.  Damn lol
---
It’s A now with the update. For stashes you don’t see the quick menu anymore so you hit A now.
---
I wish there were more of them because I need their drops to make stimpaks.
---
you really shouldn't die from TSE weapons. Might wanna check out some build guides. On the other hand getting killed by some V.A.T.S. crit build is pretty common. Best solution is perma stealthboy. About the killing part: Either go V.A.T.S. crit yourself i guess, or gamma gun them down if they are a bloodied build, or stagger them to oblivion with PA and one man army and a decent heavy weapon.
---
PlayStation but the point I’m making is maybe they could do it if everyone, people of different consoles many people would love to do it
---
Yeah, that's the worst part.  If the Watoga vendor mirrored its inventory to Whitesprings - which makes no sense, but let's pretend it does - then it would be a convenience.  As it stands now, it's just another place to check, and we didn't need more of those.
---
This is a pretty good idea. I've had too many people jump in just to leach and then sit back. I've held all 3 pylons so that people can kill the assaultron because no one will pick them up and have yet to get anything decent out of it. A single star assassins golf club for holding the pylons, spending stims and damaging the bot? Whoopee....
---
I took off the mask for that reason. I haven’t really found any head gear to go with it though.
---
Ok I havent updated yet but thanks for the info
---
Maybe the loot is respective to the damage they inflict? Just an idea, maybe not a good one lol
---
You make a really good point.  Back when you're low level, Watoga and Harper's Ferry are kind of mythical and out-of-reach to you.  Now, screw it, everyone is at Whitesprings.
---
I checked. You're right.
---
Totally agree
---
That’s the total AP pool. Endurance is the rate of AP drain while sprinting.
---
Ok I'm sorry, I jus wish they kept some incentive to play the new mode.
---
I thought the walls always clipped through floors like that, that's why I never build top heavy camps
---
thanks bud hopefully that quantum quenches your thirst
---
Is there a reset on the loot here?  I just got a notice saying The Encrytid Event was live.  Went to and helped complete it but got not event complete notice and sheepsquatch was empty...
---
there's a hotfix coming hope they fix this soon enough
---
I spent the whole time as a lvl 60 stimpacking every fallen tank and shotgunning tf out of everything I could with enforcer. I probably didnt do much dmg to the boss in the end but i was certainly helpful in my own way. How hard would it be to quantify a healers helpfulness in something like that?
---
it will thanks
---
Sometimes the door doesn't load and you have to jump servers. Is that what you're referring to?
---
Sometimes I do this, I have my very own playlist filled with oldies, rockabilly music, and songs featured on fallout.
---
No, the one where you turn on the washer and dryer and the wall opens up
---
It’s fun and hard, I enjoyed the 6times I died
---
No. They might have at one point but have not for a long while.
---
I wanna be able to do this too. I have a boxing centered character and would love an arena style boxing center
---
It breaks its own INTERNAL lore.  Lore between different games is it's own thing, especially when you're dealing with prequels.
---
Oh ok
---
I can’t remember the name of the town but it’s south west of WestTech. Directly west just on the other side of the cliff face is a pond big enough for 4 water purifiers. It’s low key when I had my base there I didn’t even have turrets.
---
The point would be that bundling them would be a discounted price...
---
I'd explain that by saying Maxson was not particularly thrilled with Taggerdy at the end.  She basically wound up questioning his guidance and defying him.  Maxson had his lofty ideals, but he wasn't on the ground in Appalachia, fighting what they were fighting, losing good soldiers left and right.
---
It's not the kind of story you'd want to tell others.
---
I would love all of Nuka World’s content brought  to Fallout 76!
---
Dont remember black being sold.   But i bet them fixing the camo is the source of your issue if so.
---
Protest march
---
I'll trade if you can build fixers.
---
Yo I lost alot of caps n aid.. but I got alot too. I figured out some tactics to run solo and I had some fun!! Some ppl walked right thru me and others lost all to my bloodthirst!! But it sucks that it was said to be geared towards pvp and it gets nerfed cuz it's too hard for ppl. I vow to only hunt others and spawn camp the rest of the my days in the wastes
---
What's distant thunder and where is it
---
I owned that too and still bought the bundle for 1500 atoms.
---
I have a Lvl 50 fixer
---
So server hop grafton?
---
I like this better. No more accidentally grabbing ammo or notes. I'm definitely still getting used to it
---
Where are you spawning?? I think your exaggerating in what you say
---
You need your shots to be crits with the gauss regular shots should only be for building crits, use unyielding armor for your bloodied build as many peices as you can, even if they are 1 star till you get better, also use serendipity perk.   For your shotgun toon stagger is a must as well as skeet shooter, crits are a must shot guns build them insanely fast with four leaf clover, stealth boys get you close enough to melt people if you decide to drop crits for a combat shotgun and just rapid fire them to death.
---
Update:  I now have 2 locked on my screen.  I think if you log out while someone has their mic active when you log out, it can or does stay on the screen.
---
Bundling a bunch of things they already had for sale with a couple new things is a way for them to get you to buy something twice. It's no accident.
---
Post stats please
---
Mainly during events.
---
That’d work. 
---
I hope they do it. More people would be able to get the bundles if they weren’t double buying things.
---
Even as much as it may suck and mods probably should be putting posts under filters, at the same time, you should also avoid the sub reddit or any other source until you've completed the content.
---
Same. But I needed those shot gun skins real bad.
---
The bandanas or surgical mask look pretty decent
---
Cranberry bog. BoS quest to clear out scorched from a location
---
That sounds like people should team up and use team medic and other boosters. 
---
I loved it once when SBQ event popped up, I spammed team invates to nearly anyone there, no one accepted.
---
Sure it wasn't highly needed as it was nuked so that we could fight it outside the nuke area. But little later someone died there and used the call for help. I was smiling. You want help now. You sure didn't want help to me. So die.
---
(yeah I get pessimistic at times)
---
Is there a difference? I just have the fixer that you get from the end of the quest
---
Pretty much, Grafton day is easy and protest march normally follows you can usually also do swarm or suitors and manhunt (don't even do dogwood die off it's bugged)
---
Also if you see the it's a trap event its an easy Sb lol as you have 10 minutes with a grounded Sb
---
Huh I'll check it out thanks
---
Not sure what you’re looking to see but you’re welcome to join me to take a look at it
---
They claimed faction based pvp was in the future. It'd be nice if you could claim towns for a faction or something separate from the pve events
---
cool story...
---
.
---
Bro
---
You just have bad RNG
---
just press the tab on the calendar.
---
What? you dont like repairing everything individually because all 3 of your mutfruits plants got destroyed and thats the only thing your missing?
---
Bandanas or surgical mask are pretty decent
---
I m sorry I'm jus salty as hell bout the nerfs
---
\#3 is a new change related to the "Escape Artist" perk.
---
Unequipped, I do not enter that brief Stealth Boy (chameleon) effect when sneaking.   
---
***With*** it equipped, it happens every time I sneak.
---
That's just what I've observed.
---
I mean, in all seriousness, No Man's Sky is a pretty awesome little gem now and that probably had a rougher launch than Fallout 76 did and they are a smaller team.  How many updates have we gotten from them and they haven't charged a single penny for them?  I would gladly support a company like that who works toward a genuine, honest relationship with their community using goodwill and worthwhile updates.  This microtransaction bullshit is for the birds...
---
Who wants to start a discord Fallout 76 radio station??
---
Thanks dad
---
It’s actually for all Power armor left arms currently
---
...needs more dragons
---
The problem with changing the store fronts too much though is it possibly violates the lore.  Whitesprings is still so pristine after all this time because the robots have been cleaning and repairing it to exact specifications, that's why even though the place did have inhabitants at one point there's zero trace that anyone ever lived there beyond the occasional corpse or holotape.
---
Maybe they will eventually add a loot drop boost to the Atom store.  ;)
---
Damn. Yeah. Didn’t think of that
---
The point is to get you to do the boss fight more often, what's the point of a guaranteed legendary if you're just going to get what you want and stop doing it altogether? In video games where legendary weapons and armor are a game mechanic its typical that they make players grind for the armor and weapons they have.
---
Tedious grinding is lame but they're not going to HAND you the shit you want, work for it.
---
Wait sorry just looked it’s a level 30 my mistake, I can up my offer to 3k
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/0ezESA8 assassin cryolater 4 sale if u on ps4 lol.
---
And here's this stupidity again. Bethesda Game Studios did not make ESO. Zenimax did. Zenimax did not make Fallout 76. Bethesda Game Studios did. They're not even on the same engine. People like you are why we get entertaining Gopher rants. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6Ed_KpTtNo
---
I'm not scrapping them solely for the fact they have a unique skin. I would never.
---
O o f
---
Why tho when this mode was said to be geared towards pvp?? I love the fallout universe but pve sucks and they gave us a mode that many asked for and it gets ruined by a crowd of ppl who it wasnt intended for. What doesnt make sense to you here?
---
You’re cool
---
That's pretty messed up
---
Today has been the worse by far.
---
What's the point of doing this boss fight at all when you can get legendaries easier from farming other enemies? Without a guarantee 3 star legendary there is no reason to do the boss fight what so ever.
---
That's odd. All my stuff was unlocked already
---
This is a great idea and let's you do pvp without just being trolled or constantly fighting. I mean there's already an arena built in the game up at the raider camp in Pleasant Valley. Player made arenas would be even better. Great idea!
---
YUP I killed several 3 star legendaries today and got one 3 star item. The rest were one star. Why not just name every legendary 1 star and if we get a 3 star item it will just be a huge surprise !! 
---
Only reason I'm paying 1700 caps for an assualtron callback circuit board or whatever they are called is I want that imposter outfit.
---
Eat Grape Mentats :)
---
He's not supposed to, you need the keycard and the quest doesn't guarantee that the Sheepsquatch appears, because then it would appear every time someone completes the quest, its similar to the Scorchbeast Queen, where you need to nuke the Prime Fissue for her to appear.
---
Lose everything?? c'mon dude this is light pvp for real.  Dont spawn in hot areas.. play smart maybe??
---
I think a lot of people misunderstood what I said. From what I have read, the legendary vendor will allow you to turn in legendary weapons for tokens - more tokens for higher legendary star count - which would then be used to allow you to “re-roll” a legendary effect on an existing weapon. So what I was saying, giving a practical example, was that I will cash in my shit legendary weapons for a bunch of tokens that I will use on other legendary weapons to try and get better effects. I have a ***radium rifle with 2 great effects, but the primary is junkies effect - with the tokens I can potentially turn a bad rifle into an amazing one. That’s what I’m hoping for
---
They're rare drops m8, the Sheepsquatch has a different loot table than other enemies, THAT's what makes the boss fight worth it.
---
I just get frustrated and scrap the stupid plants and never plant them again. That's why I never have any plants
---
Fuck I'm pissed that they changed it!!! I'm sorry
---
As a language arts teacher, it hurts to read that paragraph.
---
Lol. Yup. Thought about that... We know next nothing about the legendary vendor. I expect it to suck initially.... Maybe only a reroll of legendary stats on the same weapon? That would awesome if you have a good weapon with crap effects or super lame if you have a rolling pin or pool cue. Hope there are options to change weapon or just re-roll effects.
---
it's kinda gross :( I wanted to floor and maybe the lights which aren't available for purchase. if I wanted the rest alone, I could buy before or now without buying the bundle. it makes me not want to buy ....anything.
---
&gt;EDIT: Things get fixed by storing and placing them again.
---
Make a bigger base, so you won't have time for useless micromanagement like this. I mean, that's what I do, and I don't care what happens to it.
---
Why is B - normally the cancel option - the confirm option?
---
Maintenance /= hotfix though.
---
I use a skull bandana but I wanted the hooded ninja look. I wish the green hood could also be black.
---
You can scrap them and repair all.
---
I’m just so use to hitting X that’s it’s actually pretty annoying haha
---
was there a reason to remap the button?
---
What about adding traps that the audience can activate to make thing interesting?
---
Found that out the hard way  - easy way for one of them is make a new char, and just level up by doing the Vault Tec Robot Quest in Flatwoods
---
what does that even mean?
---
I'm not 100 percent on this but u dont think you can loot his body after he dies, I think it's just the item rewards you receive
---
I play Destiny too, and lemme tell ya... getting exotics outta blues was hella messed up
---
I’m 100% loving it as I use to grab ammo on accident as well I just wish they didn’t change the button since I’m so use to hitting X to transfer
---
I had the same thing happen yesterday. Traded 3 of my 3\* unyielding and some cavalier pieces to my other guy to apply mods. After trading back "controls have been disbled". Goodbye new set I spent tons of hours farming and trading. Haven't started the game up after it.
---
[](/ksaffronlol)I died at one of those events earlier and had my bag stolen. Wonder if we crossed paths. XD
---
That's good to hear. I was a little disappointed with the Imposter boss if I'm honest (not in difficulty, just... aesthetically). 
---
It'd make sense if he was the final boss of the Burrows like people are saying. Can't wait to find out.
---
no not at all they said they took away the little preview window but i dont see why they had to remap the button ...the same button still opens the inventory on the camp thingy so i don't understand why they did it
---
Nice keep grinding you'll get what u want eventually 😋
---
My boy and I are bloodied and we had 50 fucking idiots in PA running around and only one was on a conduit. We kept trying the other two but kept dying......Tell me what's wrong with that picture
---
Two shots or TSEs
---
Maybe own a workshop or two on adventure where you can pvp or be passive?? Anyone I meet in survival is gonna eat lead I tell you!!!!! Let's do thhhiissss!!!!! I have to make up for a cap nerf
---
XB1?
---
You can get a plan for it from the event
---
Noticed this a lot today in both modes. It seemed to happen when enemies were nearby. If I tried to travel somewhere else it would tell me I couldn’t because of that. I’m thinking maybe it doesn’t give the option on teammates if that’s the case?
---
I was talking about when you would get blues out of exotics
---
Both..a couple just two shots..but 5 tses
---
The servers are undergoing maintenance. There is no hotfix upcoming. Your link even says there are no changes to the game.
---
Oh by classic you mean Fallout 3.
---
It’s just junk. Not a big deal. The fact that the stash limit is not limitless yet is the real atrocity.
---
I was hoping it'd have something to do with the huntmaster quest(considering all the trophies in the lodge), but for some reason it won't let me do it, so I don't know.
---
I hope they lock characters into modes soon!! I really think pve ppl should stay away from survival
---
Ahh my bad, I didn’t see that, sorry
---
Gotta shoot that Gat like a gangsta
---
I've done it 2-3 times so far, twice successfully, once not.  I'm not that crazy about it.  The whole thing feels needlessly rushed and chaotic, and the mechanics of the pylons are just weird.  Some of the things I would change:
---
* Don't have a 2,000 cap entry fee for the user who starts it.  That's ridiculous.
---
* Have a delay between starting the event and having the boss show up, like with Scorched Earth, so other players have a minute or two to drop what they're doing and help.
---
* Make the vulnerable/invulnerable transitions a bit softer.  It's very rigid right now.  The split second a conduit dies, she's invulnerable.  I feel like this would work better if the conduits granted a minimum period of time where she was vulnerable.
---
* I'm not sure if conduits get loot from her if they don't commit damage at some point, but they should if they don't.
---
You can control it from your phone, pull up the Spotify app on your phone when you already have it open on the Xbox/PS4 and you should be able to select your console as a device to listen through. That’s the best way to get full functionality from Spotify, because the version of the app currently available on consoles only allows you to search for specific songs, albums, or playlists. Using the phone app allows Spotify to auto-play new music based on what you were previously listening to, plus you can browse from your phone without interrupting your gaming.
---
Just make it so that items that are currently equipped or favorited can't be scrapped.
---
Sorry man..wow that's a wierd thing..I'm always worried about stuff like this
---
Does the usual end of event reward sequence roll?  I didn’t see anything.
---
Gauss rifle is best
---
It's near East Mountain Lookout.  I think the SB was a (rare) nearby random encounter.  I've had the occasional attack by super mutant warlords and primus, too.  Or mole rats.
---
Also each pylon gives you +25% damage dealt while effected by it
---
You do realize that the bundle \*is\* the discount price, right?  It just sucks when they add items that can't be purchased separately to the bundle because it FORCES you to buy the same item twice.
---
They inspection screen is where you'll have to go to use the repair kits. Probably not a coincidence. Now if you dont have enough materials you just quickly use atoms instead.
---
I have 150+ hours in FO76 and haven't seen a single rad storm.
---
Bethesda plz.
---
Yea for real. Never even crossed mt mind. Ive gotten disconnected a million tines..but never lost anythin. Especially nor the gubs i been collecting. Shit take all my 1*. But to just take those hurts deep.
---
Supposedly this change helps performance... so... adapt!
---
Twin lakes is good for alot of purifiers. I recomend the north side as a lot ofbpeople use the southern side
---
Good Ideas
---
&gt;Just before I logged out to go to bed, I tried one more time, and watched a vendor's caps go from 0 to 600 to 1400. 
---
To be honest that's rather strange. 
---
You see my main has no access to Enclaive, yet the caps the vendors had, was 0 after patch, as I had just cleared them before patch. I tried selling to them anyway to make sure it wasn't the glicth that sometimes happens, that it just doesn't display correctly.
---
So the game didn't track individual pools for each faction, because then it should have had the 200 caps I could not clear off of Enclaive. But I had to wait for them all to reset.
---
[](/AJinterrobang)What about the Legendary Chainsaw?
---
Well then. I guess it's time to tear down the post then. Rip. thanks for letting me know though.
---
You're really cool.
---
Really.
---
Really, really cool.
---
I spawn at  the more obscure train stations and keep weapons holstered and stay crouched before you do it. I stay off the beaten path and avoid high traffic areas. You can see all the bag markers when the killin be happenin!! Its alot if fun or it was lol. Jus gotta ay different cuz ppl are deffo hunting you
---
I wouldn't dismiss it, the luck stat does have an effect on the amount of non-legendary items that drop (eg. on ammo, stimpaks etc). I think it also affects the quality of the legendary drop, although the server you're on also seems to be a factor too. Before I respec'ed my points, I had LCK at 2 and all I got was garbage 1 and 2 stars with the occasional decent weapon like a handmade or supersledge 1 star, even from 3 \* enemies.
---
Putting 12-15 in LCK and using unyielding armor (+10 LCK at low hp) and alcohol (+3 LCK from the Happy-go-lucky perk) definitely helped me get my hands on much better gear.
---
Jeez man why do you put yourself there? You have to go with my spot. It's near sunshine meadows industrial workshop. It is a junk pile next to a tank and a fallen lumber truck on the riverside. Decent farmability of ghouls, adhesive spring etc. and a guaranteed Giddyup Buttercup at the workshop along with food and adhesive.
---
I forgot that one.  We need that too!
---
The option to surrender is available. It's called A server hop. That will end ownership of the workshop.
---
There is no enemy in the game that gets a health boost based on the amount of people participating. This is a myth that needs to stop being propegated.
---
Sincerely, a dataminer who looked into this extensively
---
P. S. She has a little over 32k health
---
Oh you don't worry about me Unyielding melee build, got my set from a duper and I never die and can 3 punch scorch beasts to death along with any player and the fact is you need either my build or a build developed to kill me and lets face the facts everyone who loves fallout plays their own style and doing that in this kind of game only nerfs you.
---
Camden park might be beneficial, the raider camp there is filled with supplies and can occasionally spawn power armor
---
I was the same way with the Christmas lights. I wanted the colored ones but not anything else. Had to pass.
---
Her health does not get buffed based upon the amount of people. This is a myth that has been going around for a while
---
Yes when I just did it it popped up the item rewards and then listed them, I did it two times. I got a white fedora which I think is apart of the event then I received a daisy cutter fatman on the second.
---
I get this on Xbox too. The voices are there, just super quiet. It seems like a proximity volume issue, but I don’t know.
---
I swear every 1/10 times I clear ws golf club there’s golfer ghouls there instead of the charred lvl 68 I’m used to just try to clear ws regularly if your high enough lvl
---
One week I legit got 5 two shot guns (non-TSE) I couldn't give those things away..but if something were to happen to my TSE lever or handmade..
---
Just checked and I got The Fixer plan.   Maybe I just missed the notice. Thanks!
---
I seen a bunch of these yesterday atop some buildings while doing the new quest.
---
I want roof trees!
---
Nice! That sounds better for sure!
---
Yea I've not been able to figure it out. During faschnaut was probably the last time it worked correctly.
---
Awesome! No problem
---
Dinosaurs.
---
Colonel Gutsy doesnt care for your shotgun looks like he did more damage to you before you got out of the power armor.
---
Vengeful Mothman does not run. Check his title when you see one. Some are docile others are not.
---
Yea i just sold my tse lever..had another guy looking to get mt tse gauss..pulled it out of my stash and anything starting with two was fuckin gone. Bullshit.
---
Don’t take my word on it but back when they first started allowing mods for FO4 someone was talking about how Bethesda could not bring things over from games like New Vegas or FO1 or 2 because of licensing issues.
---
Started on Tuesday for me. Super annoying.
---
Did you sell items on the web for cash?
---
I've got my camp beside Watoga, if you go out the back exit of Phoenix's shop, you'll be heading the right way. Gets a little attention from scorched and muties, but nothing my turrets can't handle. Have 3 large purifiers running there.
---
WTH, I would do this for a friend but not a slave
---
No thanks, if they did that I would have a harder time murdering people in Adventure mode.
---
He won't be. He ha shis own set spawns
---
If your refering to tomorrows maintainance its just server maintainance no hot fix 😞
---
It’s fallout my friend. Slaves exist!
---
Edgy i do it too
---
I guess u can maybe email Bethesda let them kno what happened..see if they could view your inventory..see if something glitchy happened.. and help you out? I'd say it's worth a shot
---
was it only a Christmas bundle? trees were separate tho? anyway I hear you but it was all unique stuff never sold before for Christmas and very much requested ...this is with a bunch of old stuff (still can buy it alone) and a few new things in the whole bundle (the only way to get new stuff)
---
Had the same problem. I fixed by putting both master and voice chat settings to the max and by lowering everything else.
---
Any reason they can't allow players to load up their own music in game? I think FO3 had a ton of mods that expanded the radio song collection. Some DMCA rule? FO4 was also very restrictive with music.
---
I dont even know where to send it to. Do you have any idea?
---
They are doing server maintainance tomorrow
---
The ticks in 76 make my skin crawl. I have a visceral reaction to them unlike any other mob in the series. 
---
Deathclaws, especially back in 3 and New Vegas, made my heart rate go through the roof, but nothing else makes me feel disgust like the ticks
---
I had balls before you were born, boy!
---
It is meant to, but the prime receiver wants .44 rounds. This is why I reported it as a bug.
---
If I missed this in another comment, I apologize...
---
Relating to the "weapon blocking crosshairs" issue:  
---
On my Reflex Sight (Circle) equipped Lever Action Rifle, if I'm holding the button (RMB on PC) to aim while reloading *but interrupt the reload process by clicking Fire* (LMB on PC), then the gun raises back up with the Reflex Sight blocking view. . 
---
WORSE YET is this does not go away no matter how many times I click Aim. The only way it returns to normal is by invoking a Reload. 
---
This is 100% repeatable for me on the Lever Action. Basically, it's trying to aim down the iron sights, which it doesn't have, thus causing whatever optics are equipped to be blocking your view. *(Thankfully in the Reflex's case, it's see-through and isn't blocking all that much.)*
---
Regarding hitching: I personally do not qualify the momentary\* "freezes" as you called "Hitching". For me, hitching is when the game is still working and you can still function, but the frame rate plummets momentarily. This *does* happen to me, and everything does literally begin hitching since my frame rate drops to 22FPS for about 5-10 seconds (seems to be things are loading... I dunno, as I run 76 off an NVMe SSD so that should never occur).
---
And by "momentary\*", I mean that those can sometimes result in a few second freeze, upwards of 25 minutes, which is my new longest period while viewing this post! Previously, entering anywhere around Charleston would cause this, and the freeze would last anywhere from 30sec to 2mins. This was finally resolved in.... patch 6.5? 7 maybe? But also now occurs during SBQ fights (still happens in 8). 
---
However, it ALSO is occurring in the Immitation Sheepsquatch events, which is where my \~25min freeze just occurred! I died from some giant explosion, and then as my corpse was flying through the air with "RESPAWN in 2 sec" on screen it froze. I left it alone as I wanted to hopefully get loot for the event, and then got caught up in your post. Low and behold, as I was replying to the "sneaking and momentary chameleon effect" post, it unfroze! I expected to be disconnected, but I wasn't! I was greeted with being respawned, and the on-screen text events play out (activate the pylons, pylons active, rinse repeat) until finally it said it was completed and I received XP, caps, and loot... No disconnect.   
---
*(None of this should happen unless it's related to either the server, or connection speed. My computer is more than capable with a Ryzen 7 1700X at 3.85GHz, 16GB DDR4 @ 3200, and a Radeon R9 390 8GB. Only my 2mbit avg 4G connection being the limiting factor, and in this even AND SBQ fights, there is presumably a bunch of data being transmitted.)*
---
Thank you for this thread! I genuinely believe the moderators should have a thread like this and it be stickied right next to the Bethesda Patch announcement. If not, then at least sticky yours! :) Not only does it keep Bethesda appraised of issues, but also keeps players aware.
---
You still there?
---
If you didn't visit whitesprings daily you were missing out on 200 caps from selling. Now you don't have to though.
---
Incorrect. I was in the cave below the highway on the cranberry bog and someone threw a plasma greanda up top that damaged me. I wasn't killed but I've noticed it a lot. Move along if you have nothing of value to add.
---
Try here bruh..let us kno how u make out:
---
https://help.bethesda.net
---
I've always wondered why the radio or Pip-Boy doesn't live stream the audio instead, that way it could always stay fresh. Eventually a playlist becomes repetitive. Bethesda podcast? Tune in at blahblah CST for the news, or maybe someone can talk about the lore and grace us with an enriching history before spinning some vinyl.
---
Mine sure don't.  No stomp, no vent.  X01 armor.  Pain train works fine though.
---
Holy shit. Thank you for the info, im so close to leveling up as well.
---
Oh ok thank you
---
Good news! Only need to level up once as long as you fulfill all 3 requirements listed under the daily. Level up in Watoga, Level up while wearing power armor, and level up while well fed can all be done in one level if you are in Watoga, wearing PA, and we’ll fed, then level up.
---
I don’t think you get what I’m saying- I’m only requesting the button mapping be changed to hit X rather than A to open the transfer menu.
---
The caps vendors offer are your daily allowanse. But you have to collect it daily. Just collect all sorts of stuff, and sell it to vendors. Now you can get like pure 1400 with like no fast travel costs, per day.
---
 Play every day, for a week, and you get 10k. But yeah it does require collecting stuff too, so you can't play for 30 mins a day for long, and keep having something to sell. Drugs are particularly great, they can be made lightweight, and they are fairly good value. At level 54 you can have super duper and for example chemist perk. That allows you to make several combo dugs that you get extra. Buffout plus mentats buffatts(or whatever it is). But because of those perks, one buffout and one mentant, becomes more than two. And each is little more valuable than the basic drugs they were made out of.
---
Just work on a routine and it should become quite easy.
---
After weeks of people reporting bugs with enemies in events being mischaracterised as sheepsquatches, I can't help but wonder if that was actually intentional and we really were supposed to feel like Calvin at this point.
---
I run Lone Wanderer 3 and I've noticed that I can stay as a pylon god a lot longer than everybody else - I'd been using it to buffer the 'squatch's attacks, but can anybody test if it affects the pylon god DoT outright? (I would but I don't have any keycards right now.)
---
I love these posts please don't delete it I have to go to bed for work and I want to check the responses tomorrow 😁
---
Yikes
---
Cyberpunk should do me for a good year until Bannerlord comes out :)
---
Full as in max allowable weight, or just over weight?  If you're running around with 1800 carry weight, I can understand why you're missing something, but if you're just at carry weight, you'll get the rewards anyway.
---
Happens to me all the time, I run darned close to my carry weight and get put past it with the rewards.
---
Also you need to buy an expensive circuit board and when you initiate the event you lose the key card, meaning you can only start it once(?)
---
Ah I see. Well .. good luck with your request.
---
F for you and the Gauss. Whoever found it (if anyone did) was in for a real treat.
---
Just wondering where does one get the slave collar?
---
I been having issues with the stares causing the building to not be placable sense patch 6. Sucks, every time I have to move my base I have to completely rebuild it.
---
Platform?
---
Oh you're a prick. And yeah classic \*bethesda\* fallout. Ya know, the 10+ year old game.
---
Prison
---
I've tried restarting the quest with the poster and server hoping to get it back but it doesn't do it, i was half way complete with it anyway and I don't seem to be the only one with this issue.
---
Heh I get what you mean :)
---
On Xbox there is a glitch which disables the reload benefit of scattershot when you enter/leave PA, forcing the user to unequip and re-equip the perk for it to work again.
---
Thanks, not really sure why they changed it in the first place?
---
ffs there's literally 20 items of clothing/armor from fallout 1+2 combined.
---
This isn't the end. The real one is in the game just not enabled yet
---
Also do what they should've done with survival and force everyone to create a new character
---
yeah same, i was worried it was a timed thing I missed and not just a bug but hopefully bethesda will fix whatever the issue is, i'm sure they will
---
Does the Free States bot say "live free or ... DIE!"
---
My favorite line in the whole game.
---
really even after the patch
---
You can kill all those new vendors. They even give you XP!
---
I don't know how WS bots&amp;turrets react to it, since I always start from the top floor.
---
Armor vanishing is both.
---
You can but some spawn in before the world fully loads. Making them drop to their death.
---
And I love it...
---
They said they are going to do that.  They never said it would be in this patch.
---
My buddy is making a high Charisma build to share cards. He was talking about using the medical malpractice legendary .44 and use it to heal with the critical shots. I think any of the group related perks might be really nice. He wants to try unyielding gear and try running it at 50 or 60 percent health just for the stat boost.
---
I currently run a sneaky rifleman build with some perks in melee. I just got a suppressors explosive combat rifle and I have a mutants explosive cryolator I've been stashing for awhile. I think the cryolator might be a nice crowd control weapon for the freeze ability and the suppressor rifle should help reduce damage while still being able to have a bit of punch. I also recently made a trade for an anti armor/50 pct limb dmg lever action. I want to see how effective that is for crippling high speed enemies.
---
Overall I'm pretty excited to try out the dungeon!  I really hope it has lots of cool challenges that make some of the more obscure perk cards useful. It would be fun to run aquaboy/ hacker/ etc. It would be kind of cool to see some of the less desirable armors like exterminators (mirelurk queens)  become the meta for dungeons. Lol
---
True story, Ive been in 3, and saw one creep up the mountain I was on it looked fucking cool
---
Yay!!!
---
Well as person who has been playing this series since 97’ I was simply just getting clarification in regards to what classic is. It could have been open to interpretation. No need for name calling.
---
Their is a picture of a data mined model of the real sheepsquatch that was put on the deathclaw rig but it's not in game yet or at least no ones seen one yet I don't have a link to the picture but it should come up if you go online and search "fallout 76 leaked sheepsquatch " and then go to images
---
Smart
---
I was overweight
---
I dunno about that one, man. Last weekend we did the SBQ and my mate got 1* combat armour, I got a drill. And he kept on getting syringers from Watoga legendaries last before this update.
---
Still an issue as far as I can tell
---
That Gun would be a nice addition for example.
---
One more question... does the event notifier work only within a certain distance?  If so do you know about how close you need to be to get the announcement of the event?
---
I just wish the moth man looked more bad ass. He just doesn't look very menacing in the game. I think there is a real life statue and he looks pretty sleek and mean.
---
Anyhow, still digging the little vinyl!
---
Aww, I didn't mean to make you go buddy!
---
Put your card in the stash. If you try to activate it from the computer and don't have a card and the event is not on cool down it will say that you need a card. If it is on cd it'll say aborted
---
Have plenty of fedoras or I can trade a full mascot set . Or caps .
---
Oh, worth noting... Aside from the freezing issue.. the game runs 10x better than previously! Seems to be less micro-stuttering and frame drops. Things even seem to visually look better as well!
---
If you do this you're not allowed to wear underarmor either it would ruin the aesthetic
---
IMO, they just need to remove camp,item durability entirely... That and npc attacks...
---
Genius. Great idea
---
Why even follow a subreddit for a game you don't play or even bother commenting on it?
---
I know this is but late but the cool down is 3 hours so you're better of server hoping
---
I got the notifier way across the map. Someone needs to complete the lying lowe mission then you get a ticket you can craft to put in that little shack where the fight takes place to summon sheepsquatch. I think I saw somewhere too theres a 3 hour cooldown for the event too so you may have to server hop, not sure tho
---
3 hours
---
 *"Protect and Serve!"*  \- Sadly ...
---
I believe you can get the fixer plans as well
---
Water consumption is through the roof for me as well.
---
Hey thanks for the reply! That’s way too long, pretty disappointing. I ended up starting it by server hopping eventually though!
---
There is a medic prefix on weapons. I think it is that your vats criticals heal your teammates
---
I've already tried every combination of armor equipping, even taking off everything and then putting it back on. It would make sense if it was a clipping issue, since you couldn't wear underarmor under your outfit in Fallout 4, but it still sucks it doesn't work anymore.
---
Bald head. 
---
Clean Spacesuit.
---
Scientist Goggles.
---
Mr Freeze.
---
They aren't that rare. I've found several, even one or few 3 stars. Even managed to sell a few, of course none really great, but good enough for people to buy.(maybe TS or bloodied or whatever, I think one 3 star was semi-decent)
---
Come to think of it, it's been really ages I've seen even a one star level action. And I still kill most one stars as well, even though I can't really use the gear myself. I've probably found more legendary Crossbows than lever actions, in total, while not saying a lot more, but still more.
---
I recall around level 60 or so I briefly tested one normal level action because it had few good mods on it. Didn't really like it, nearly as great rate of fire as TS bolt-action, but the bolt-action was far better in damage thanks to pre-nerf TS. Hell I even eventually modded it to .50 because the ammo was cheaper to craft.
---
But Crossbow? I've maybe fired 20 crossbow bolts in total. That's saying much about the weapon.
---
I had an issue with weapons but if you (I'm on Xbox) hit y to view the item then x it will mod them
---
i know you can get the fixer as a reward. the fixer is just a reskinned combat rifle so idk bout plans
---
Quite simple really.. They shoot you. Hahaha..
---
Oh, that's just what I heard on the market but idk
---
A brotherhood officer suit with the shielded mod.
---
If I'm wrong, I hope someone will correct me, but my understanding is that you can't learn the plans for headlamps, you just have to buy the mod from vendors.
---
Yep I encountered that too last week and that's what made me believe that there's more to this
---
Fuck that's rng dependent
---
Travel? Those fuckers show up at my camp in Cranberry Bog each time I login 😂
---
They could but that would require Bethesda to do something useful. So...no
---
No soup for you!
---
Because no one is trying to scrap their favorites.
---
Counterpoint, her health could be scaled server side and we would never know.
---
Xbox one.
---
What system are you on? If you're on Xbox, decent chance I have it. They rotate pretty well at vendors, though, I haven't had trouble finding the ones I want just keeping my eyes open.
---
&gt; This entire thing seems like you just read a review of something from someone's facebook who practices stage acting at public libraries.
---
"This entire thing seems like you just read a review of something from someone's facebook who practices stage acting at public libraries."
---
Your a whiny little bitch, was my insult.
---
Ps4
---
I knew it, I had a gut feeling it wasnt it I just needed to see if I wasn't just too hopeful lol
---
On PS4 at least, if you have a sound system setup with a center channel, dialog is always super low. I haven't seen any fix other than pumping up that channel specifically in the receiver, but I really don't want to throw the balance of my calibration just for a game. Drives me nuts.
---
i mean idk either it is possible i just think it seems unlikely
---
Yeah first time I did it I was like the people whining about it because we got the pylons down but we barely did any damage. Next time I got the event we did it easily had like 9 people doing it lol. I was just repeatedly poking him with my bloodied (+40% swing speed) combat knife haha games super fun, as is the new content!
---
Hes a cutie
---
Well its submitted. By the way you guys know the cut off for canvas bag submissions is may 9th? Send in your tickets!
---
Add the following weapon bug please?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbqtc8/bug_gatling_laserplasma_initial_fire_bug/
---
Not been mine nor anyone I play with experience. 4 of us. 2 running with 25+ luck my base luck is 11 and normally is 14+ 
---
There was a giant post categorizing and summarizing loot from hundreds of runs and luck appeared to not be a factor there either. 
---
You're own bias is just making it seem like luck does cause you feel like it should.
---
Those might be linked to the presidential event that was found by data miners. It never made it to the full game though. Just like the broken assaultron in the pit at the enclave entrance. You can still interact with her/it and was linked to a sidequest. Audio files etc. were still in the game.
---
I will say this again because you imbeciles don't understand it. 
---
A 3* LEGENDARY IS NOT GUARANTEED TO BE GOOD.
---
In most games if I kill a boss I AM GUARANTEED A BETTER PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. Does it mean that equipment is good? Not always. Does it mean it is still better than what a 2 or 1 star would be? Sometimes.
---
Is this something being organized because I have some willing participants?
---
Yes we would since ive been checking the data stream to see what is being sent to and from the client and it does send the health values
---
If you want to add my psn I’m on now if you want to come 😂
---
Oh right. The RNG on the gear itself isn't RNG? Just the drop itself? 3* legendaries aren't always good.
---
LOL, that always works!
---
Im not on at the moment, but my group is dying for some large scale PvP.
---
Borderlands 3 is going to come out and smear this game into the ground.
---
Well just let me know when and I will set it up
---
What platform? Totally interested tho
---
Don’t you get damaged when you go on top of or inside the cabin? I get like a darker screen &amp; take consistent damage. Could’ve just been hooked to one of the pylons &amp; didn’t realize but I got a weird screen effect
---
Been kicked tree times today (xb1)
---
Exactly, doesn't make sense it's not under voice settings. That issue on top of paper notes being to "damaged" to read sometimes has me walking up close to the tv on quests like an old man lol.
---
I rethink my opinion of the game on a daily basis.
---
PS4
---
Lol. Many do. Just look to all the popular MMOs and Co-op games. They have much better loot tables than Fallout 76.
---
Yeh true, was just going through the obvious. So probably a bug. Hopefully it's apart of the "server stability" maintenance today. Sorta major quest seeing as it's how to get the tables, so shouldn't be too long for a fix (fingers crossed)
---
As an owner of the top hat plan and seller of at least 20 plans, I’m behind the nerf. Maybe they could have let us have a bit more caps for them but no biggie :) they are still worth selling
---
Wait that's cool as fuck actually
---
People will sometimes bulk stuff to sell it and also pickup other scrap on the way.  When they try to scrap it they also scrap the bulked stuff and have to bulk it all over again.  I've done that a few times.
---
Have you played the other fps fallout games? Grenades were always an insane risk. The range, drop off, collision(no los range). Always a harsh wake up when it screws you over.
---
full world but I'll keep trying lol
---
My heart and soul are your if you transfer to XB1
---
I didn't finish the quest(just got to the riddle start), and now there's no way to restart the quest. It's not listed in my pip boy, but yet the label is still there with a diamond.
---
Cmon Beth
---
Well they crapped on me fellas. Nothing they can do "due to tools we have in place" or something like that.  I guess it is what it is. Really puts a bad ass taste in my mouth. So god damn frustrating
---
Yeah I was buying a bloodied combat knife that had +40% swing speed &amp; 15% less damage while blocking &amp; I was hoping this guy wasn’t gonna screw me over as I couldn’t see anything past bloodied
---
You were probably over encumbered which was why you could only respawn at the Vault. That many legendaries sounds like a glitch, probably a result of you tagging the same mob so many times and exiting the zone between hits (my best guess). Pro-tip if you're going to farm West Tek have your camp nearby.
---
If you want one ans are on xb1 i can make you a lvl 50 ver for free
---
It was released in 1968 so it might be too far past their timeframe but I really want Glenn Campbell's Witchita lineman in the game it fits so perfectly with the vibe of Appalachia
---
They took a huge nerf. And a lot of people were upset because of it. TSE went from a 200 percent dmg bonus to a 25% (or something close to that, sorry).
---
So yes, they are still good. But if you are getting killed by them, there are many many counters out there.
---
I have been playing since December so I saw it first hand. I went from doing like 2000dmg a shot to like 300.
---
lol this is hilarious. It's literally right there and I never paid attention to it. Thanks you guys!
---
I walk around with just a bit of health missing for all those bastards out there trying to snipe me with an Instigator
---
My third blade instigating mole miner gauntlet with healing factor I named it Hugh Jackman.
---
Yeah me too, I wish he was a more hard core like a scorched beast since the mothman is a real folk lore in West Virginia.  
---
But yeah there is a mothman statue in West Virginia, my girlfriend took me to see it right before the game came out, it's pretty cool
---
There are people in this thread than roughly the same specs as mine, if not a tad worse that seemingly run the game better than I can. And my rig is way worse than yours so I don’t know what’s going on. I straight up just can’t play the game, I had a quest at the top of the world and I couldn’t make it to the elevator because my game was freezing and stuttering so bad that I was dead before I made it 😐
---
I’m nice enough to leave them be. But I think I did get someone else’s stuff earlier.  
---
After the event I went to pick up my bag. Pressed to take all, but realized there was more in my bag than I remember carrying. I don’t know how. But it *was* my bag. 🤨
---
Do you have the perks(if there is any)
---
    public bool ScrapItem(Item item) {
---
        if (item.isFavorite &amp;&amp; OptionDialog.Create("u sure fam?", "ye", "nah") != "ye") return false;
---
        
---
        return item.Scrap();
---
    }
---
This was pretty advanced so it makes sense that it took them so long.
---
Bro same. There are points in the game when I just love it l. And then there are parts that make me question my faith in Bethesda.
---
Bruh I guess i’m just doo doo
---
Right 😂😂
---
what do you mean so far?  it's happening tomorrow morning...
---
I was never big on the idea of plans being for sale at vendors to begin with.  Maybe a couple simple camp plans at each vendor to get you going.  Selling armor and guns is cool but they should have kept the plans out of them.  Kept them tied to specific world events.  Imagine more people would be doing them.
---
I think that a build swap system would be a good idea, if it was pretty much just a quick swap of the cards. A SPECIAL respec I could see occurring through an ATOM shop purchase. It would be a full reset, but allowing you to instantly allocate the points you’ve earned instantly.
---
It could be set to fail the second the aggressor moves out with zero chance of being able to do it again.
---
I still visit the originals for buying. It seems they have a different item pool. The ones in Whitespring have been showing the same few items, but if I go to the vendors original locations I see a lot more variety. Basically Whitespring are for selling, and maybe buy something basic. Original vendors for plan, and mod hunting.
---
You can't convince these people of lucks actual effects " I got a good drop once with my high luck" therefore luck makes drops better. 
---
They don't look at statistical evidence, and just let their own preconceived bias changes their memories. I run with someone who has roughly double my luck and someone else with half of mine. 
---
Over the course of hundreds of hours and well over 100 starred enemies probably 70 3 stars or so. Our drops have been roughly on par or within regular expected variations. The lowest luck person has gotten more 3 stars, but not enough to make a difference. 
---
People run with high luck often, but thats because when you finally get a good drop you don't want it to have a bad durability bar. Thats why people run high luck. But you don't get more or better legendary drops, maybe some other items but no effect on legendary drops or spawn rates. 
---
I hate games with an attribute called luck, it leads to people claiming it does far more than it technically does because they confuse "luck" of the player, with the ingame version of luck.
---
Water consumption and food consumption both are ridiculously high. In real life, we can go days without eating or drinking. True, we'd dehydrate faster than we'd starve, but still. I, myself, have gone several hours without drinking a thing, and days without eating, but in the game it's like I can't go ten minutes without downing some water or grub. If I ate and drank damn near as much as I have to in the game, I'd never leave the bathroom cause I'd constantly be pissing and crapping. This should be drastically cut down.
---
Weapon Issues:  
---
Tesla rifle often gets that famous damage bug where you don't do any damage to enemies. I have a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In3vuy3HCLM) of the bug.  
---
It seems to happen very often if you have two-shot or Quad legendary.
---
I think consumable mods are broken right now, you can only do mods y9u have plans for...
---
Someone would get ambitious and join the new event as a low level and then we’d all be hearing about it here.
---
oh Im so in 
---
\+karma
---
Lol don't beat yourself up man. There's a huge learning curve in some parts of this game.
---
I don't even use Tse weapons anymore.
---
I love this! Which system?
---
I wish they had warned me before scrapping that damn assaultron circuit board...
---
Pc
---
To be fair, the name of the boss was also on the roadmap, part of promo material, and is shown on the poster that starts the new quest...
---
I have no clue. Ive been wondering the same place
---
This! Such a perfect time to do it!
---
What a wholesome burn haha
---
As a lvl 109 vats stealth sniper, would I be helpful on the roof taking out the robots? I can 2-shot gutsys. I strolled up to the event last minute last night and only took out a couple bots before everyone took down the ISS so I didn't get a good lay of the land beyond the first impression of OMG WHAT'S HAPPENING!?! Also, do you know if VATS and gun-fu will target the ISS when she's still invulnerable? That would be a pain if it does.
---
Is anyone aware of the cool down timer on the event? I've got a couple cards I want to use
---
I agree with you. I'm convinced that they didn't do just that because many people would have logged in and had no idea their gear they bought was duped (lots of potential backlash).
---
Sorry
---
Yes, I have played them all. This being a multiplayer game however damage bugs are unacceptable.
---
yep being above 76/powerarmor/watoga earlier for that daily.
---
RNG applies to all aspects of loot from the effects on gear to the drops itself.
---
i just want people to know that playing games with High RNG is good. AKA Borderlands franchise.
---
the RNG in that is huge sometimes it takes 100 - 200 runs on one boss to get them to drop the legendary or whatever item with the right rolls of attachments but thats where the fun and replayability is as well
---
Curious as to what the fifth one is(wolf bear owlet and radstag)
---
I've done the event twice, let me give you some advice. Don't use stimpacks, just die. The respawn is right there. I also got a 3 star unyielding/+1 perception/+15% damage reduction from standing still marine chest piece, so it's not all bad. The other piece of loot I got was a 2 star unyielding piece. I assumed the drop rate is better here than for regular stuff... will need many more events to truly see.
---
Not really the ammo cost will never be efficient for anything other than just messing around for the lulz.
---
Has anyone actually used this?  Wiki says 10%.  For 3000 caps, I'd like to know for sure
---
Tell him he's dreaming!
---
Sure, but in those games you'll likely find a useful gun prior to that. Also the raids in borderlands are fairly quick and easy.
---
Yuppers
---
Cant you just store it and replace it? I think that worked for some of my walls... unless I remembered wrong.
---
I agree with you and was surprised when I noticed it being much like explosives in the previous fallout. At least you didn't find out by blowing yourself up like I did hehe.
---
Exactly the reason for this post, we need a way to prevent this kind of stuff..
---
I don't even bother with the boss fights anymore, you end up wasting a bunch of ammo, stimpacks  then it's back to the camp to repair guns and armor costing more resources that you have to re-stock costing a bunch of caps or several hours of farming. It seems like that's all I do is farm. They should re-name the game "Farmout 76. Not to mention the nerfing of guns and the enemies being bullet sponges.
---
It took his melee 3 hits to kill me and I'm wearing shitty excavator armor... Still a bit extreme though considering he just rams you over and over and you still die in a few seconds.
---
I want to buy it?
---
I custom name all the gear (weapons &amp; armor) with my character name in the front. That way they're all bunched together and a lot less likely to get scrapped.
---
Ahh so you were hiding in the highway in watoga with foundations blocking the entrance and you’re butthurt someone was clever enough to figure out how to still get you.
---
Ya wasted your time making this topic, move along.
---
You there
---
Yes
---
You do get rewarded for the event on top of the corpse. I got two legendaries from one run.
---
With how good Bethesda has been doing these past few patches it wouldn't surprise me if they just dropped human NPCs randomly into the game.
---
exacly bro you got it down.  
---
people want the easy way out they cant handle having to put hours into a game to get something out of it.
---
You can server hop to find it, server hoping is just leaving and reentering a world
---
Omw
---
I have lvl 120+ support character and its amazing how many people want to party with me.
---
Q: Is the "original quest" start, found at a RR Station bulletin board by chance &amp; until you have read the note partaining to this quest it won't progress? Just wondering if one of the new Sheepsquash side quest &amp; that particular story line may have gotten crossed by mistake somehow?
---
Hmm, fresh meat.
---
*Re-enables Cannibal perk card.*
---
Ready!
---
I got rid of my first one bc it wouldn't repair to 200%. Why is this a thing. I just got a 3 star and I love this one but it degrades so much faster than my steadfast all rise I may have to stash it. Shame. I love these axes. I hope it gets fixed!!! Upvoting
---
I haven't tried here recently, but about a week ago me and some friends wanted to launch multiple nukes and Bravo was the closest one to me so I took Bravo while one friend took Alpha and the other took Charlie. However, anytime I'd enter the silo, I would get booted all the way back to my home page, and twice I got booted so hard my internet cut out. After the second time having my internet crash, I stopped going inside, and I didn't crash the rest of the night. My friend ended up taking Bravo, and I ran Alpha instead with no problem. We launched 3 nukes down by Lewisburg.
---
Sometimes you just get dry runs. Data miners find nerfs fairly fast, so we'd have heard about it by now if something changed.
---
If you are a pylon god you do take continuous damage, you also get targeted by the monster
---
that worked for a whole day for me.. then it put me back at my old spawn point off a cliff.
---
we need the mats back for camps
---
I don’t wear my power armor very much. He just walks up to invis and fists you to death in one hit lol.
---
I don't mean to be a debbie downer, but you're actually hurting the dps output and wasting resources. The respawn is literally right there, there is no run back. I tanked it the first time I fought it and if I went down I gave up and was back in the fight faster than people waiting for revives.
---
But last patch they said that legendary enemies will always drop a legendary item
---
Double oof cause I've been spending my last few nights on both these games!
---
O  O  F
---
I knew that lol. All my luck points irl must be in other special stats.
---
I have a 3* crossbow that has extra damage to super mutants, faster reload, and can't remember last stat.(really stats that are nothing to write home about)  I love using this weapon when I'm farming that super mutant log camp in the top left of the forest.
---
Aka Doo Doo
---
Cause everyone has legendaries haha
---
If you become the conduit are you able to move anywhere or do you have to stay by it? I'm always afraid to go tag the sheepsquatch in case I make it invulnerable again
---
Can do it later today, ofc. That was the first time I logged on after making this mod and the screens looked so good I decided to share them asap -))
---
You're gonna love when we get close to him and he gets delayed lol.
---
I was speaking in regards to the patch this week.
---
Patched from what I’ve been reading all day.
---
Oh noes.
---
I hope it's something good. 
---
Past 2 weeks or so, I can't ever switch character ingame. Every time I exit my current char to main menu, it throws numeric error, then infamous "platform login error"(no one seens to get that accoring to google), and then it says daabadaa your login ID whatever from launcher has expired. So  I always need to exit the game, and restart it, to switch a char, even briefly. The game is fairly fast to start, but that means I always need to redo my inventory sortings, and not super fond of doing that over and over.
---
Funny, just checked, the numeric error is 4:7:2000 and only hit about that is for Bethesdas German self-help pages that implies the error could be not having retail code binded to your account. Yet I get it every frigging time I exit to main menu to switch char. Oh well.
---
ah! yes, i forgot about the cryolator, good call! i think i have a medics version in my stash actually. Haven't actually tried it out yet..
---
Your budies build would be pretty fun. Helping out the party with decent damage from unyielding, and the non stop crit heals would be sweet. My main is a gunslinger type and the number of crits after crits you can wrack up can be pretty nuts.
---
Like an option just for that session, once you leave the server it's gone.
---
then there shouldn't be daily/weekly challenges that require it.
---
Or because they have absolutely no way to know what was duped - no unique item ID, from the way things sound.
---
I really hope you used a thick Austrian accent
---
Two shot makes it semi useful. It's a good use of 40mm from scorched leaders.
---
I find that heavy gunners are the best support builds for a hybrid. You can get 9 charisma. 3 for supressor, 3 for tenderizer. And 2/3 for the sharing stimpacks. The heavy guns actually have good firerates to keep up supressor. You get PA which is good defense for little costs. 
---
Medic weapons tend to be lack luster. But they could work. But ideally if you share stimpack healing everyone will be tecovering nicely.
---
Get int to boost stimpacks by 45%. 
---
For sharing perks the stimpack one is actually really nice to share so everyone heals each other. Other choices are a general damage buff like bloody mess if your team isn't running it. Which can actually be really good if they want more defense in their build. Life giver is great to share but it also depends on what team you have, if you have people running bloody it won't be much. It also requires 12 charisma. So that could cut some more offensive perks outta your build.
---
This is the build I run and my team really feels a big boost when I'm on. I can share Lifegiver because my charisma boosts above 12 with stat boosts but the game sometimes glitches out and removes it, usually between areas or fast travel. If my base was higher that problem wouldn't happen.
---
Far cry 5 did that and I thought it was really unique and wished other games did something like that, scarface 2006 did it also kind of but that's a totally different game
---
I agree with all of this except the thrill.... I have no thrill, it's been gutted knowing I won't get a 3* lol
---
No, i'm a PC player. This build i don't have yet. planning on leveling a 3rd character this weekend in anticipation of the dungeon! trying to think of a fun charisma build to do. Wanted to see what peoples thoughts were on party focused builds.
---
I don't even care anymore, none of the effects mean anything to me, they are all just future currency to use to get the gear I want when The Purveyor arrives.
---
Ya for sure!! Before this you never needed to have team perks. They were nice but not essential. That's why I hope the dungeon is difficult in interesting ways. Not just full of bullet sponges.
---
change to button that opens stash is disruptive. given that they still have not implemented a real action bar and UI controls customization, then changed one of the buttons without my permission, its in overall an increase in the interface bloat. in time i will probably stop hitting the old button, but why can we not just get a usably customizable control interface
---
Go see the Responder vendor in Whitespring
---
Aaaaaaaammmeeeeeeen
---
You can only share one card at a time regardless right? Usually 9 charisma is plenty. 12 will get you max Lifegiver. Any of the 15 cost shareables are usually more convenience based ones or explosive damage.
---
So if my Pacifist mode is on I don't need to worry about dying in events from other players?
---
May wanna use smartphone recording like iPhone or Android phone. It takes a few secs to power up the camera albeit both your hand will be fully occupied (left hand on camera, right on mouse / keyboard) :)
---
Lol. Weather I was doing that or not it doesn't change the fact that this is a bug.
---
Ya know, in a world where it's kill or be killed, dowhat must be done to survive, y'all sure are hard on people who actually play that way. I mean, I wouldn't do that myself. If I see somebody's bag I usually leave it there. I say usually because there have been times when I've seen people die and guarded their bag and they never come back for it. I've even messaged some of them and told them I was guarding it, and I've been told to go ahead and just take it, so I do.
---
It’s for the sheepsquatch stuff
---
Awesome
---
&gt; We know next nothing about the legendary vendor. I expect it to suck initially.... Maybe only a reroll of legendary stats on the same weapon?
---
Except they told us what he's ultimately going to do and it's not rerolling the same weapon. You turn in legendaries for new legendaries. More stars means higher chances at better loot. How they go about that is the question but I can say with confidence we're not going to be rerolling anything.
---
Haven't done the event but I've seen plenty of low lvls at SBQ in hazmat suits doing dick in the wind. I let them die to adds and ignore their frantic arms waiving.
---
Does the cryolator need heaven weapon perks for buffing damage? What kind of mods does it have?
---
yeah, this was a total drag just emphasizing how badly we need to have full ui / action bar control customization. too many functions are locked and linked, unbindable, not able to be adjusted. was infuriating and there's no good reason for the problem to be a frustration for players
---
It bothers me when it's got a spoiler warning tag but the title is just saying what it is. Like...come on.
---
Make sure to wait and double check the corpses. I've noticed a loot lag with legendary enemies. If you check right after they die, there's no legendary drop but if you wait 30 seconds and check again, the legendary drop will appear.
---
This is one time I recommend it. Doing a little bit of extra damage wont matter if you spend 70% of the time dead. Staying alive longer = more damage dealt for this scenario.
---
Before the update I had a 3* ghoul drop two 3* legendaries. It wasn't a tough fight though.
---
They're given to you after you do the sheepsquach side quests (the little notes on the board in Calvin's house)
---
Well that's sad
---
In addition to keeping the pylons activated can the melee build players stop forming a human shield around the boss so that those of us using ranged weapons can help? Having a bunch of people standing around it with their power fists slapping the boss just doesn't work. Meanwhile I can't get a clear shot at it.
---
You need to buy it? Where do you do that? I went from Garrahan to the pylon shack and then the quest seems to have evaporated from my quest list. Never got a tag to go anywhere to get that card.
---
Yes! This kept biting me in the butt during a queen fight. Was so infuriating. I'd rather have the old bug than this. I don't know if this is a new development or not, but I also can't switch weapons during the plasma gatling reload animation. I can with all other weapons during their reload. I know that it stops the reload, but there are times when you think you're safe and hit reload only to be bum-rushed by a glowing wendigo out of nowhere. I should be able to abort my reload and switch to my shotgun. But nope. No amount of button spamming will make it abort.
---
You had the same thought for heavy guns for suppressor and tenderizer i did. I didn't think about sharing "team medic" out. though. that's a good idea, make everyone a healer. it does definitely matter what your team is sharing out and running. I thought life giver would be a good default and can arrange from there party dependent.
---
I was gonna say if you were on console I’d like to team up, I like the idea, I run a bloodied sniper build, during any group fight I tend to just clear out the pests from flanking melee players but could certainly use a medic on my side
---
Doesn't it take 3 charisma to share 1 card? So with fifteen charisma you could share 5.....I think. Lol
---
I never have had more than 4 points. 1 for travel agent and 3 for lone wanderer or team medic when grouped.
---
I hope they remove all weapons and replace with healing spells.
---
That's great. I've been playing solo pretty much 99% of the time so trying to embrace the party aspect of the game. planning on leveling another character up this weekend.
---
Just a PSA... Corn, Tatos and Razorgrain can all be rug glitched! If you place a rug you can (with much finagling) place those crops on the edge of the rug. When you pick up the rug you can place it anywhere you want, no dirt required! The best part is you can clip planters at the base of those crops to build a hydroponic farm right inside of your camp.
---
this is covered in my Jan 1 inside the Vault feedback response, thank you for bringing it up as a very important problem. I feel that containers could solve this efficiently, by having a barter table container which facilitates a trade, each player can place the items they want to potentially pass along, and add caps if desired. this will easily make item for item trading work. it should run almost exactly like fallout 1 bartering which every npc had.
---
I run a support heavy gunner. Supressor weapons are good for support builds especially if you're running other debuff perks. 
---
For weapons I recommend getting heavy guns. 
---
The actual medic weapons rely on crits and it can be hard to mix and match vats builds with support builds where medic would naturally align.
---
I was more annoyed with the amount of shotgun ammo a spent than anything but I would have used that on something regardless. I chose to use stimpaks to help because I had a massive amount of them I had been saving for player vending. I chose to spend my stash on this instead of waiting. I would do it again assuming I get a reward bugging out or not being able to loot the body would make this hurt more than anything.
---
Tbh this has inspired me to get a few of the healer perks if events are going to be hard like this in the furture it would make it fun and worth it for me.
---
Some items can be “replaced” instead of stored and still get repaired, e.g. plain barn wall replaced by a barn wall with windows.  Just about anything with a side-scroll option will work with this, and often costs zero resources as well!
---
I was picturing like sleeping on corn lol
---
You can only pick one card to share at a time. If you try to share another it removes the previous share. Higher charisma just let you share higher level cards in my experience. Unless it was changes recently.
---
You said in another post that you want there to be FO76 plus like ESO plus. 
---
Idk what to think now.
---
Ah sorry I just couldn’t remember off the top of my head how many there were, so I just put 4-5
---
This saved my guns
---
They replied that fast?
---
An exploding head is always an exploding head. I love all those tiny pieces flying around.
---
Oh yeah i did and i was wrong as fuck
---
This is like the one thing I’m super stoked about, I’m a hunter so getting these mounts is like most people’s desire to collect all the outfits
---
All no-plan "pinebox" mods are broken right now for weapons, armor and power armor -- even if you've got he right perks equipped and everything. Regular mods that you've learned and have the materials and perks for still work tho. However, there is a patch tomorrow that will hopefully fix the few issues people have been having but the notes say it's all server side and nothing gameplay related will change, but we'll see.
---
Is this an event that goes away after a while like the Faschnacht one? Or is it a permanent event?
---
Yea ol boy Matt droppin nukes tonight on your boy. "Sorry bud our hands are tied."
---
Now tell Mama Dolce.
---
Changed my mind im all in now
---
In one of his Fallout 4 "Is it Moral..." videos from a few months ago (I forget which) he offhandedly equates homosexuality to paedophilia and bestiality. He hasn't changed his opinion at all, he's just realized that it's no longer acceptable to outright say "gays are an abomination."
---
I honestly have no idea. It should let you share more cards the higher you are. It would be sweet to share 5 ranks of cards
---
Permanent
---
I feel like I'll still visit Harper's Ferry cause it's a decent legendary farm.
---
Oh yeah lifegiver is a solid choice. Its just generally useful and good. I think i just prefer to have the extra 3 points from charisma diverted to some stuff to help me hit a bit harder or be more durable since empath really makes you vulnerable. (Things like fireproof and blocker) 
---
If you aren't running with bloody people you could also pick up the perks that removes rads from allies when you take rad damage. That would easily get you to the 12 required.
---
Yeah, item for item trades with randoms is too risky. I hope Bethesda makes item for item trading part of the trading window.
---
Ő BUCKET
---
I believe they have made no significant comment. I feel like it would be disappointing to get a function like that for the mere couple of characters I have rather than a flexible system for characters to form an ongoing alliance, level it up, have sharing containers, and possibly even perks and a super camp.
---
I run 9 charisma, I've only ever been able to share one card regardless of its level.
---
Because if your spamming the scrap button you could accidently spam through this screen too and still scrap it by mistake
---
unfortunately you can only share one card. I was going to stop at 12 but added the xp boost because why not. Think I'm going to reverse that though as i don't think there is a 5 point card i'd ever share.
---
Todays run was just as bad.. i swear.. all i did was adds.. and it was just as bad.. *sigh*
---
Certainly, having events this hard makes something other than max dps builds finally a good option. I often play supports/healers in other games so it'd be neat to have a viable healer option here. But there are lots of mechanics currently in the way of running that. Besides you also need a group for most of the healer/support perks and legendaries.
---
Yeah, yesterday I had 8 CTDs in a bit under 2 hours. After that I validated my files, nothing was wrong, but I haven't been kicked since .\*crosses fingers\*
---
yes, i use a legendary pole hook
---
Pole hooks or meat hooks? I'm after the ones on a big stick
---
And that isn't gross and sexist because...?
---
I'm on xbox one. I won't be able to play for a few days though. We were trying to recruit 2 more people for a team to try the dungeon.
---
Gunfu/vats crit build. Instigating or two shot, ideally with +vats crit damage. It can work, but an auto grenade launcher is nicer with the same legendary/build.
---
Pole or meat hook? I've found heaps of meat hooks just no pole hooks
---
Yes they are, I just can’t recall where I’ve seen one recently. Try following the river on the west side of The Forrest region. There are many little shacks and docks that should have some. I would start in the north and move south.
---
This comment got more hate than it deserved
---
yeah, and i lost my CAMP team up emote, the one that plants a flag
---
The pricing really is absurd. If they had more items in the shop they could reduce the overall prices. Sadly, they don't and it confuses me beyond belief. Obviously wouldn't more items in the shop be a priority for a company that wants to make money? It baffles me. The atomic shop is lame. No money from me.
---
Used to be Camden Park and Grafton (town, not station). IIRC the plans do say "Excavator", just not the mods.
---
Yea I’d like that, just a heads up, I’m packing my house this week and moving from Victoria to Yellowknife, so the next couple weeks I’ll not be available often, but my gt is communistraptor and I don’t have a mic
---
I would be interested depending on price and legendary effects
---
He's not targeting real people? It's a video game in a fantasy setting? Would you be just as angry if he used body replacers for male characters that have dicks? Here's a thought. How about we stop attacking people for the mods they use in their video games like they're Nazi Germany?
---
I had a full set of t51 on and it fuckin near killed me in like 20 seconds. Im assuming it ignores DR.
---
Yes, I can't believe how much time I was spending running around selling stuff. Now it would be nice to raise the vendor cap limit a bit so I can sell the extra stuff I can aquire with the extra time.
---
If the idea was to give people more actual play time, then we need to be able to sell more stuff or we have to quit the session once our weight and stash become too cumbersome. I'm kind of getting sick of just throwing away "legendary" items.
---
Also the robot at Camden Park.
---
Well, that's kind of your fault for buying it, no? Microtransactions are shitty by nature, so there you have it. This place, and basically EVERYONE else LOVES to whine and bitch and moan about them even existing, yet here you all are buying into them...
---
Didnt try selling, but you could rename it at least now
---
I believe you can get some from doing the new Encryptid event. (I could be wrong though)
---
I personally do not do events for cosmetics in this nor any other
---
It was a little more than a blog post against gay marriage.
---
Yea this would be a very nice option for them to implement.
---
Ya, im pretty busy too but we can try to meet up and try running it. Just add gt:shadyrebob
---
Can confirm. I got to the end of the quest and the computer tells you to come back later. Server hopped three times and got it to trigger.
---
Someone who favourited a legendary one but the favourites carry to every weapon of the same type
---
It appears that applying MODs is broken, I tried to add a claw MOD to a deathclaw, same thing as others, acts like it's doing it then nothing changes.
---
I'd advise anyone that wants to be a conduit to bring as many healing items as possible and prioritize staying alive above all else. Do NOT try to fight the Imposter Sheepsquatch or robots beyond potshots if it will result in you getting killed. 
---
If you're able to get up there, I found the roof of the house to be a decent spot for pylon conduits to hunker down. You're relatively safe from the bomb bots and the Gusty/Imposter Sheepsquatch have a slightly more difficult time hitting you up there. I even found that the AI for the IS can bug out on occasion and stand around doing nothing for 10-20 seconds when it's trying to target someone on the roof.
---
That's mostly player perception, mixed with server lag issues. It used to be a bigger issue, but they've optimized the fight quite a bit and nerfed some attack speeds (and booted ridiculously large inventories lagging the game). 
---
Some player damage just won't register because of server processing lag (which comes with more players and bigger inventories). . . which used to be a bigger issue. It isn't so much anymore because of said optimizations (including smaller inventories overall, with no unlimited inventory anymore).
---
How quick were you trying to do this that you didnt even read the new screen that popped up?
---
Done
---
I ROFL so hard inside it's hard to maintain serious face during a boring meeting. I love the creativity of some people.
---
I assume it would be on xbox too but i play pc with a controller plugged in
---
The cyrolator burns through ammo fast though, and medics only works on crits. 
---
You don't loot its ammo often so you've gotta rely on crafted ammo mostly. 
---
It might not be bad for a single dungeon run if you stock up though, definitely not for general play in my opinion. The flamer suffers from the same problem.
---
I do too. I will say that I've seriously only quit because of bugs maybe two or three times, which is way less than I've quit 4 or NV because of the same thing. The ones *I've* encountered have been frustrating sometimes, but not seriously gamebreaking.
---
The friends list desyncs every now and then for me. That also borks area voices. All I can do is alt f4 and restart the client fallout76.exe completely.
---
I thought the higher health pool may offset the damage increase (just use more stims). but that goes right back to your point of boosting stims higher. I'll have to think about it a bit more. maybe drop the chem fiend and chem resistant for more DR. do you know if chem fiend increases the heal over time of stim? or is it a flat 20%?
---
What console u on I have a legendary one I believe
---
Top of the world station too
---
I've seen my fifth one since bets tonight.
---
wow i think that is new good find [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=lemonade&amp;restrict\_sr=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/search?q=lemonade&amp;restrict_sr=1)
---
I'm on ps4 what's the effect?
---
While I was playing with my son last night, I noticed an old bug reappear. While he was getting in &amp; or briefly out off PA he appears in his tighty whites to me although he obv has clothing and armor equipped. So if he goes into 3rd person view he sees himself fully dressed. I however see him without. This happened during previously game play. We haven't played in a long time together so I was suprised the bug had not gotten fixed yet.
---
I'm on xbox so it doesn't matter we cant trade...😫
---
Yeah man, pole hook, I know the difference :)
---
I just logged on and checked
---
I have  lvl 50 3* berserkers pole hook, more damage the lower your resistance, +50% limb damage, +1 strength 
---
And
---
Lvl 40 3* executioners pole hook, take 40% less damage while attacking, + 50% limb damage, +50% damage when target is under 40% health
---
Ive been super creative and called my gear "#Main Armor Right Leg" ect...  
---
Even though its legendary, but this way i know when im swapping between my main armor and my "#Silo Armor"
---
Yes, the high the level the higher the health
---
Yep!
---
Source?
---
Adapt or die my guy
---
Yeah I heard from Juice’s latest video that they screwed the paler lost up again 🙄
---
I making money from selling bulk junk so much faster now that i can just go to one vendor and empty all my excess junk.
---
Haha amen man. I figured every item would have a unique ID (like WoW). Perhaps I'm wrong and they really are noob with this whole thing.
---
look at my profile
---
Lol so true. *FO76 is ridiculously hard*
---
No, it's a genuinely terrible weapon unfortunately
---
That doesn't sound very plausible unless the thing has damage reduction in the region of 80-90%. Either that or no-one else is doing anything in my queen fights.
---
The queen certainly used to scale, although that may have just been the DR. I did a lot of early-morning queen fights with my bloodied melee buddy, and they were a lot shorter when hardly anyone else showed up.
---
The fact that they do tells you all you need to know.
---
Hmmm.... a troll?
---
What would you want for the berserker? I've got caps, or I think I've got a few orbital strike beacons if you're keen on them
---
Take a screen cap and submit a bug ticket
---
First off, it is a game (and you could get perks to reduce said hunger if you wanted). Secondly, the majority of extra hunger comes from either speed demon mutation (which makes sense to speed up metabolism), or fast travel that simulates fast forwarding of time for travel. IRL though, you're in a climate controlled environment and likely not particularly exercising much irl. If you were exercising as much as you did in game, in an outdoor wasteland environment, you'd eat and drink a LOT more. 
---
Your character is outdoors in the wilderness in extreme environments, subjected to radiation, fighting deathclaws, supermutants, zombie ghouls, burning off calories and water to heal up from wounds, disease and mutation. If you did as much exercise IRL, you would be sweating it out, consuming and drinking in drastic excess of what you would indoors in a climate controlled environment.
---
It*
---
yeah, i was hesitant on the flamer. Seen a few posts about the ammo issues. Hoping that gets addressed and we see more flamers in the future. I think I'll give it a go and if it doesn't work out I can fall back on just DR perks. from your other comments I have some other things to think on as well. My goal is to get a unique build that's not detrimental to the party and i can still pull my own weight, haha.
---
Fair
---
I can say the same to you. The fact that you dont understand the diff between Pay to Win and Pay to Advance is beyond me.
---
First of all, both people can get repair kits.  They (will be) obtainible in game from rewards or you can use money to buy them.  Nextly, if you only bring 1 weapon to a pvp fight, you are not good at pvp.  Also, I donno what kind of pvp fights you have, but either you or him or both are not set up right since pvp fights do not take long at all.
---
The point im making is, at the end of the game, max power level, everything is equal.  You people are just splitting hairs at this point.
---
Effects are listed, the lvl 50 is pretty stacked as far as legendary effects go fo melee in my opinion.  The +1 strength is really nice
---
what a shame... There's already posted that server will have another maintenance today, 11th of april.  
---
I found out that server crashing had also to do with my silent super sledge mod. Had to adjust a line in the custom ini file.  
---
God i hate that sound!
---
This is some grade A fuckery I love grade A fuckery. be like my bad let me fix that then hit them with a flamer
---
Saw that today and was so happy.
---
Huge improvement
---
FF really sucks. Team medic is more than enough. You're better off sharing blocker than life giver, as most players skip that perk. 
---
It is also pretty funny to share the revenant perk. Make folk do more damage when they get revived.
---
Twin Lakes, right by the big rock in the middle of the pond ;)
---
Yes but I think they are kinda rare.
---
There is a 3hr cool down.  Someone probably already did the event on your server.  You have to wait or server hop.  Check your inventory.  You should still have the assaultron keycard.
---
Same, i assume its the sudden influx of playwrs that jpin to check out the new patch putrinf extra strain on the servers
---
A free weekend or week would probably get a lot of people hooked.  The most exciting time for me was during the beta and shortly thereafter.
---
Better take some Radaway also 😂
---
There is a hotfix coming in the maintenance tho for some stability issues
---
Stealth melee anti armor build here, made one hit on boss just to tag it then jumped right in and started slaughtering Gutsies. Feels like that makes a huge difference in group survival. 
---
IMHO if tanks are doing pylons, snipers are sniping the boss, bashers are bashing the Gutsies to keep the group safe, and low lvls are doing cleanup with eyebots, it seems very doable.
---
&gt; And hit the fallen players with a stimpack
---
This event causes lots of damage. I'm of the opinion that dying is fine. The respawn is right there, when you get downed, die and get back in there immediately. It's faster than waiting/hoping for someone to revive you.
---
I would settle for being able to blueprint my main CAMP structure, which hasn't been possible as of several patches ago.
---
Cryolater is a boss killer. Specifically, SQB. I should try it out on the sheepsquatch, but I didn't think of it at the time.
---
Regular and mark III stealthboys no longer work on the favorites menu. Making the mark III completely broken.
---
Yeah, I want the Free States robot to tell us more about government bureaucrats trying to steal our money via taxation.
---
I haven't played for a few weeks. How did the top hat get nerfed?
---
I was thinking about more "revive" perks. At the moment i don't see many players go down. But I guess we'll have to see how challenging the burrows is
---
I'm sure it would if you can target invisible assaultrons. After all, that's all ISS is, except tougher and way higher damage.
---
I would do it for 4k. But I'm pretty  tired at the moment,  if you dont want to pay that maybe tomorrow if you have any cool plans or legendary stuff to trade we could work something out maybe a combination of things tomorrow
---
Charisma 10
---
Praise the lord.
---
I can see your point on the company getting money but I have to spend a good amount of cash into the camp cosmetics and I think that a repair kit would kind of shit move from the company especially because there are a lot more things they can sell for camps and cosmetics. I've spent over 100 dollars in this game and about 50 hours of my life. and I think a lot of people are getting tired of this I would rather pay another 60 bucks for full DLC content than repair kit. and yes the company has to make money, but anti-consumer tactics haven't been very effective in the game industry lately.
---
I'll have a look at what legendarys I have later today and I'll PM you if I'm interested, cheers
---
Thank you very much!
---
Sounds  good
---
There is nothing anti consumer about this though
---
I got the Yao guai and owlet from doing the mission from the board on top floor of the taxidermy place. Not sure if it's random or not. Also got the picnic blanket plan.
---
Game is not capped at 30fps.
---
I have yet to use my Cryolater. getting some good notes from the thread though. I'll have to equip a few cards, and dust off some weapons on my mains stash before deciding on a coop build
---
I came in here last night, not really knowing what was going on (PC). All I could do was kill Eyebots and try to figure out what I was supposed to be doing.
---
#4 happens to me and I am on X1. Had this issue every once in a while before. But since the new patch its become regular. My camp is located on a cliff side &amp; it seems like the long load issues / not moving are messing up/ with the landing point. I can see while it loads that I seem to be floating in the air &amp; then promptly fall. When (!) it lets me reload to my campsite again I am fine. Sometimes I have to walk a bit before I can select fast travel to my camp again as oddly enough it seems to have me at my camp and wont let me fast travel to it unless I put a lil distance in. I wasn't gonna say anything as like I said I am on a cliff face and figured its part of the amazing view I have. But after reading this I realize that it may not be me.
---
It has 3 hour cool down so good luck.
---
Yes I did notice that as well. No condition or even weapon stats when equipping mods! So yea it’s just a big mystery at this point! I imagine it will be fixed on Tuesday at the latest... I hope!!!
---
Thanks TG626
---
 You made me giggle.
---
Hmm how would I get that to reddit?
---
Yea but like is that only the you gui and radstag and wolf?
---
Great! I will take up on this offer soon. Not tonight, but soon.
---

---
Here is my current build. 
---
You have a lot more endurance, i traded mine in for luck. Class freak can give you a ton of raw stats +4 agi, +4 perception, +25% crit damage,+20 carry weight, +2.5 to all specials, and i got speed demon for preference but its definitely annoying. You do lose 2 strength though but herd mentality counters it. 
---
The raw stats bonus to agi and perception help cover your major weakness. 
---
I would highly recommend one gun army as you can lock down big enemies and cripple limbs. I do it constantly to deathclaws and other big enemies. 
---
I got the autoheal on agility to help keep me up during the heat of battle since empath makes you more vulnerable to burst damage.
---
Yes. Unless you want to buy one off someone
---
When naming items, put ZZZ in front, itll always be at the bottom. For favorite items, toxstay more up, put ZZ
---
A set of Sentinel armor outperforms Power Armor defensively... if you're standing still. However, until it's easier to get the 2* legendaries you want, the T-51b outperforms all other non-legendary armor available.
---
In my experience with this game, the only people who PvP at workshops are just looking to one shot another player for caps. They couldn't care less about having that workshop.
---
I do big guns and have a nice explosive plasma gatling that rips the bots apart. Once I get the jump mutation and starched genes, I'm going to basically smack the shit out of the adds when the shields are up from that roof, so I can stop worrying about getting blindsided by the deathbot..

If on PS4, download message app on phone.

---
They definitely exist.  I think they might be like super sledges where they dont have low level versions.  I think I've only ever seen them on high level scorched, mutants tend to carry sledgehammers
---
I didn't see the card in inventory but I'll take your word for it. I have the recall keycard option under Quest Items when I craft at a tinker bench, but the ingredients list for that says I'm missing the assaultron card.
---
Upload to social media or streaming site (youtube for example) share the link? Also you can copy video onto a usb upload from a computer if you hav one (least on ps4 i imagine xbox is the same). Not having a go, just would of liked a clear video, I'm fairly blind lol. I didnt see any pictures when I did it :(
---
It's because fewer people means less lag, and the server is less stressed by heavy players running around trying to calculate all different variables. Also fewer players in other parts of the world trying to proc events and spawning mobs and doing other things that eat up server resources.
---
Yea but how would you get the scorchbeast trophy
---
I hear you. I have spent around 3k atoms since I got the game on the like 2 items I liked.
---
I'm sitting on my atoms just waiting for something worth a damn to show up (The new bone raider PA skin is tempting).
---
They definitely exist.  I think they might be like super sledges where they dont have low level versions.  I think I've only ever seen them on high level scorched, mutants tend to carry sledgehammers. 
---
Plans for a pole hook might not exist, if they do I'd love to know where to find them.
---
Lol the sarcasm was heavy!
---
Have suggested this many times.  +1
---
Now this is the Fallout I remember (Fallout 3 was awesome)
---
yeah was thinking the same thing actually, thanks
---
Amen
---
Yeah one of the random vendors. I also came across him in the bog :)
---
Yeah, I gotta admit.. Finding them just standing there.. Is a bit sad really, and shows the bots no love at all.
---
Just Upvote so noobs know how to do it
---
Server crashed during SBQ earlier when we were about to kill it, then I just lost connection to the Sheepsquatch event I started
---
yea im 47 and still don't have it!
---
Yes!!! Something.. at least. Just a bit of flair.. Please Bethesda!
---
Super Mutants tend to be pretty heavily armored, so you gotta blast through that before damage happens.  No idea on radrats, they do seem tougher than they should be.
---
One thing I can’t figure out.  Once I activate a pylon, do I have to stand by it or am I free to run away and start killing.  I have been standing guard and shooting?
---
I would say that it has definitely prevented me from buying some bundles.  The solution is to either plan the bundles to always include entirely new items or offer an appropriate reduction in price based on owned items and their costs, as you suggest.
---
Higher level enemies have more health, and higher armor.
---
Yep. I went to a certain art place where people talk quietly, got some plants and then almost lost an eye due to a malfunction in the equipment.
---
Well this is fallout, those of us still here on this sub are the fairly open minded. What with still playing a high-concept scifi game that was essentially broken on launch and the entirety of the internet stills rags on and all.
---
Warning, Preachy sjw time. Highly off-topic and ranty:
---
Its not this way on a lot of other subs... im sure you've experienced it. There's a lot of un-tamed fear and aggression towards anyone who's against the "traditional" ways of thinking and doing things. I feel like part of it is *you know who*  setting the "high" example, helping push certain types of people to be more that way.
---
Just the other day I was one one of the photography subs. I had basically the whole sub, including the mods, come out and rail on me for asking why there were no women moderators (there had been a recent uptick in NSFW posts involving women. Borderline porn for some of them, definitely at least objectifying). Even though other photo subs generally discourage that kind of thing, this one was very, very adamant about keeping the status quo... yet they deleted a bunch of posts literally as I was typing replies and threatening to go to the admins. Fucked up, imo. "What objectification of women, what are you talking about, we're a very progressive sub" (paraphrasing).
---
Sorry, not trying to brag about being a reddit sjw (meh, kinda am). Just illustrating how fucked up and clique-y reddit can be. Thank you for also not supporting hate-speech.
---
Fucking nerfed
---
It happened to me. No drill, no syringer........just rad x and some ammo.
---
The execution was very underwhelming, I was expecting them to have taken over the stalls or at least shared them but had some faction stuff... he’ll even symbol for all of them like the responder... 
---
How about none of them got names, just faction bot, and they didn’t even get watoga right, it’s the BOS bot that’s in the shopping mall.
---
[Can't compete in Survival mode](https://media.giphy.com/media/dPghHslnqEKLC/giphy.gif), I take it?
---
I haven't done it yet but will keep this comment in mind
---
But the rare cosmetic!
---
If they guaranteed three star mind to drop three star gear, I would hope three star enemies become much more rare
---
i jumped on for the first time in months the other day, i was like 1500 weight, (pls no hate) and i started breaking things down, broke down my fav gun, closed the game. have not touched it since.
---
so even now they arent actually weightless?
---
well there is weight reduction for pretty much everything other than notes
---
Because nobody plays it because a team of 4 with duped gear just kills everyone.
---
Bethesda is just trying to get a whole bunch of players who enjoy co-op play and basically being nice to one another to play PvP so they aren't on the hook for fresh content. It's very annoying how hard they are ignoring what their consumers tell them every day.
---
I totally agree there should be a surrender button once you've done what you want to do with a workshop.
---
Well shit this is good to know
---
DC is northeast and east and would most likely never blow winds westward into the fo76 territory. Boston having the glowing sea in the southwest corner can make it believable that natural wind patterns would carry it north and north east
---
Run like your life depends on it cuz it does
---
Thanks for tip.
---
I will give it a try tomorrow and see if it works. I will update the post if it works.
---
Has anyone figured out the photograph next to the map? It has a park/rest stop structure in it &amp; something is circled in the photo.
---
It’s the point between Arktos &amp; Gauley I believe.
---
I searched all of these Map points as well,
---
and never could match the photo to the landscape &amp; pin/string marker point.
---
&gt;Who wrote this note I wonder
---
Bet when he finds out it was a gay guy he'll be like "fuck this game, what a waste of time".
---
(Referencing oxhorn's apparent homophobia if you haven't seen it commented on here yet)
---
Should only be if the defending team tries to defend in some way.  Either by stepping foot in the workshop to stop the attackers capture progress or dealing any amount of damage to the attackers.
---
I'd personally like to see power armor immediately crush the small model ants, rad rat pups, and small model rad roaches.
---
why is stability an issue when you have plenty of other games with more content that let you have an insane amount of space...POE for example is unlimited
---
I never buy the bundles anyways because there’s always only one thing I want from it. But sadly you can only get it in the bundle.
---
Wow yes you are a peon. If you can't work out how to do a build that includes Gunsmith.
---
I renamed my shotgun to "That Thing" because I always keep it on me
---
Yeah Ive seen it here quite a few times but I CBA to go look for myself, so I already have my reasons to not like him
---
Only if you get the perk that says handmade or lever gun.
---
No. I think you need to keep doing the quest since getting into their is towards the end of the chain.
---
I liked having to go to different vendors honestly. Made me play around that area for awhile since I paid the caps to go there. Now I just go to Whitesprings. No real insentive to go other places that I don't usually farm
---
Try using Tank Killer with that Gauss
---
I think the reason putting all vendors in Whitesprings is to reduce server load (less resources needed to fork the server for synching) while increasing the load of PC or consoles. I agree it breaks the lore &amp; discourage travel / exploration.
---
Yep always read the requirements if theyre available and you can multitask. I did it on sheepsquatch. Level up in power armor while wed fed using an instrument weapon. Timing was everything :P
---
Google "The Spanish Inquisition" if you want to learn more about why personal opinions can hurt a lot of people.

M'squatch
---
Out of the 6 times I've completed the event, I've only ever got a 1 star legendary each time.
---
On a side note, I did buy three explosive weapons and 4 3** weapons from the vendor for dirt cheap. So that was a plus.
---
Super duper does not work on quest items. They use to.
---
Funny how we judge people we don't know. You assume I don't exercise very much, yet you don't know me or what I do. You assume I'm not handicapped and unable to excercise as much as I'd like, or at the very least suffer from an injury that prevents me from doing more than I'm capable without hurting myself even more. You assume something about me, but you don't stop to think what I may have been through in life to deter me from doing what I want to do.
---
With that said, you're right. I don't excercise as much as I'd like. The reason. I have severe back pain that prevents me from being able to move like I used to when I was younger. The slightest movement, up, down, twisting and turning, even just standing in one olace for too long cause sharp pains to shiit through my back. I did something to mess my back up pretty back pretty bad and have been to several doctors all over the state to try to find out what's wrong. I have been through therapy, I've been to chiropractors, and I have had MRI's, and catscans done on my back. I'm seeing a back specialist now trying to work on getting myself back in better health. So no, though I excercise as much as I can, I unable to exercise as much as I'd like to, but thank you for assuming you know me.
---
And with that also said, when I was able to move around without pain, I still didn't eat or drink as much as my character does. As a kid, I played all day every day. I played sports, played tag, hide and seek, jailbreak, rose my bike all over town, and I still didn't drink or eat as much as I do in this game.
---
But again, thanks for judging me 👍☺
---
So a bloody build should probably rethink trying this event
---
Yes but the plan has been missing since 2 or 3 patches ago. I'm fairly sure it did exist before they changed it so all vendors have all plans. But they do still drop in the wild. Just not very often.
---
They are already rare enough, 1 in about a 500 in my experience
---
I can't dude, this was a great comment haha
---
To note: he may appear without his lemonade stand. I found him by a supply drop once with no lemonade stand in sight, only knew it was him on approach and the robot's coloration.
---
Looks like a DNA sequencing in a lab film. Or maybe, someone play too much grognak on his work terminal :)
---
Plus you can just trade for literally any legendary
---
Meanwhile, I suggest renaming it with a \* or other obvious symbol to help you notice where they are when scrapping. I do that with all my "keepers"
---
Not much of an issue anymore with the shared stash.
---
You have special armour for the silo?
---
I'll agree that strong teams are killing everyone but this "duping crisis" mentality had got to go.
---
Yeah, found that out eventually. Now I just wonder how we unlock the other heads, as they are not atom-shop marked
---
 Literally this^ when i converted my main to survival capable the first thing i did was redo my stash to include some non perishable food and stash my booze and chems
---
God bless ya!! Take my upvote!
---
It's still an issue if your stash is full.  It really needs to be fixed.
---
They had a basic flat square, and I think eventually they added a few more structured/elaborate ones later.
---
laziness + greed = no discounts on bundles. 
---
it’s science.
---
I think I can see a face
---
I've had a lot of fun with 76, never tried anthem though
---
Ok I’m gonna have to go back and try this
---
Maybe say what platform ? :)
---
I feel there will always be someone complaining about duping. I get it that it sucks, and very much changed the gameplay. 
---
But constantly bringing up an issue that at this point **cannot** be solved, isnt really helping to make the game better anyways.
---
Because fo76 isn't POE. Server stability is already an issue, and adding more stash to track whenever a player joins the server won't help.
---
Yup. I pretty much only do it for food when I need to repair it.
---
Are you kidding, adding confirmation text is great? The standards have lowered so much.
---
I have a three round burst receiver. It's called "Automatic receiver," and it works by tapping the mouse button like a sprinkler instead of holding it down like a firehose. Deals three times the damage of a single shot if you're accurate enough.
---
Smartassery aside, I regularly do this at low level until I get the the point of getting my planned weapons, as most of the time you can manage the recoil of an auto well enough to take three shots. Personally, I'd much rather they spend their time smashing bugs and making more content. But that's me.
---
It will be great if stealth boys will stop working entirely, wishful thinking 😞
---
It’s just disappointing. They put no effort or thought into it. There is more then enough space there for every vendor to have their own space and for that space to be appropriately decorated. The worst part is if they just had put a little effort into the layout and design it would have been awesome.
---
I still do the old run. Seems like others are too, since I practically only see legendaries vendored at the old vendors.
---
The whole 1400c run only takes like 30min, getting all i need to sell from mobs on the way.
---
It's unlikely they are there just to grab paper bags. The eye bots are self destructing and reach up there pretty easy.
---
Yeah...the crafting system in this game is pure garbage in a lot of ways. I legitimately cannot wrap my head around the people who insist it's better than 4's...it has all of 4's bugs, baring the ones that were fun to play with, and plenty of NEW ones mostly centered around that absolutely fucking mind-numbingly stupid "must be able to access" game rule.
---
Well Bethesda could reward players with assassin's sentinel armor for playing.......but instead they reward players with a 2* instigating M79 or a medics  .44.
---
Ahh yes totally forgot about that too. Good looking out :)
---
I'd appreciate it, just so I can see better when I pause it. I also think I see a face :)
---
Earlier I was the conduit for all 3 pylons... that was fucking terrible
---
No.
---
Level 70 player ran over to my bag and grabbed it after i got killed by the sheepsquatch and looted it. I know they looted it because I watch the bag disappear and then spinning around in place unable to move as the sheepsquatch came running at them. I lost \~350w of higher end junk, but I feel it was worth it to see the panic in their character movements before being executed.
---
Everything is in Whitesprings now.
---
That's actually promising then. I hope that the event is properly laid out so that you have flexibility with legendary effects and perks, not that the only option is facetanking in power armor like the scorchbeast queen
---
If you're into looter shooters I'd give it some time to improve more.  They've made some okay steps so far but it'll take a few months before I recommend it in all honesty.
---
Because no one likes losing half their aid items every time they die.
---
Guess they afraid of all the white wolf fedoras being sold to the vendors
---
If you're looking for a real survival experience id wait for seasons. 
---
Throwing non game gen legendary items at every player is a fantastic way to completely bottom out that legendary effect in terms of value.  Ime tho
---
You can loot the body
---
Yeah full set of troubleshooters armor, the robots hardly tickle you
---
I notice this too on PC. See video: https://imgur.com/a/qIYBXqo
---
Notice the three rocks in the river bed when I jump/move around.
---
Smarty say, "One day, Gram, you will not have special trades. No extra caps, no new things, just same old things and nobody to trade with. But you still be special, Gram. What make you special is not your trades. It is your heart."
---
I ask Smarty, "Why would Gram trade Gram's heart? Why not trade Mole Rat Heart?"
---
Smarty get angry. I do not know why Smarty get angry. Some day, maybe Gram will be like Smarty, and understand. Until then, I will trade things that are not hearts. Just in case.
---
SoTrIgGeReD
---
Should always rez the conduits though because once they die, pylons stop working and everything becomes fucked again. I just throw on quack surgeon for rezzing anyone else and save my stimpacks or my three pylon holding ass.
---
So then the question should be why is the stability so horrible in comparison
---
Done the event 4 times now 1st time, got a sheep head mask and a 1* legendary, 2nd time sheepsquatch corpse disappeared+looked everywhere, didn't see it, searched every metal pile). 3rd time spent 10mins looking for corpse, found it as a metal pile, 2star legendary, nothing else. 4th time died and game wouldn't let me respawn or do anything, camera just panned around my body. Had to Alt+F4. So got screwed out of loot twice.
---
On PC, this is still a bug for me: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7ulgt/bethesda\_can\_this\_3rd\_person\_aiming\_bug\_be\_fixed/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7ulgt/bethesda_can_this_3rd_person_aiming_bug_be_fixed/)
---
TLDR: 3rd-person aiming is off-centered when inspecting loot containers/enemies.
---
Mine was lvl 30, even though I'm 120. Is there no lvl 50 variant?
---
Not random. Got the same on all characters.
---
I had somebody help me defend a workshop only to then claim it themselves and shoot me getting  a reward of 200 caps.
---
I nuked it later as revenge.
---
Agree, the pylon players should be the only ones who don't immediately release though.
---
Honestly, those people probably just spent a lot of time leveling. The only leveling exploit I knew of was certain flamethrower traps could be rapidly deactivated (with the home defense perk) using a macro. I never used this, however, and Im sitting at lvl 97.
---
Especially with upcoming legendary scrapping. I've been quietly picking up all the low weight legendary items I can find to build up my stock. Bonus power attack damage switchblade for ten caps? Yes please.
---
I have a couple and I'm on Xbox. I will check tomorrow if interested. Just message me and I'll check my inventory
---
I think a regenerating health bar would be perfect. That way it auto repairs unless enough damage is done at one time to destroy it completely, at which point the current repair mechanic would kick in.
---
There were some old exploits, but they’re long gone. You’re just slower than some. For comparison, I’ve got a level 200+, a level 120+, a level 40 I’m currently leveling, plus a smattering of other characters (my BETA character is level 25ish, I’ve got a mule account with a level 25 for perk sharing).
---
Some people have more time to play and are more leveling focused.
---
I’m level 173 playing since beta lots of events, but a quick trick is to spawn vertibirds kill em and repeat, there was an xp exploit in the early days
---
Back a few months ago the karma farming rates were a lot lot lot higher. All those level 120 somethings came around in about December. They fixed the exploits, but didn’t remove people’s levels
---
I too would like to get my meat hooks on one of these.  I have 4 legendary hooks, none of which I'll part with.  1 star Instigating, Vampires, Troubleshooters(great for farming Watoga or running silos) and a 2 star Mutants with 40 pwr dmg.  They seem to be a fairly uncommon drop and really just a plain meat hook with the right perks is more than enough to deal with most any enemy.  Not trying to contest your request, but if more than one pops up I'm most certainly interested.  Meat hooks rule.  I'd also be in the market for an AA, Executioners and Suppressors meat hook.  Good luck.
---
So I just got past level 50 with my new main, I'm almost 60 now, but I've been over 100 twice.  I have the regular Ultracite Power Armor the brotherhood questline gives you.  This character is a charisma main so really good at supporting in battles.  I also gave her high int(12), luck(9), some endurance(7), and decent numbers in other stats (4s and 5s).  So she's kinda tough and a good support (all the charisma stim abilities plus some luck stim abilities).  I usually play with a sniper build, and from reading all these comments here, I'm totally gonna be VATsing the explosive bots.  
---
My question is, do you think I have the tankiness with only 7 endurance to hold my own in there?  Also keep in mind I'm carrying all mutations with Class Freak Lv 3.  Thanks for all the preemptive info.
---
I didn’t even find wood armor until after I already had metal.
---
Now if only we could disseminate this info to the casual players who don't visit the Reddit.
---
Because anyone running this event who has been on here in the last two days and isn't helping the pylons or being the pylons can bite me.
---
It's the players who don't 'live' on the sub who just see the event pop up that I feel the most for.
---
I'm not interested in PVP at all. Bethesda fucked that up when they allowed duping in a game where the community warned them before hand that they wouldn't be able to balance the legendary system. Now you have a few hundred player's who are playing on God mode vs. players with average gear. The game is fucked unless the dupers get bored and quit playing and never log back in with their duped gear.
---
Just be aware there seems to be issues at the moment with Power Armor mods not appearing to be working. Haven't had a chance to test this. But apparently there is a hotfix mentioned for tomorrow on Bethesda's F76 site. Hopefully this is part if the fixes. Hold off applying them for a day is all I'm saying
---
This wont be an issue in a month.
---
This is why we need the [Nukashine Syringer ](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbi74s/nukashine_syringer_would_be_amazing/) .
---
And now you can get back up to 1400 caps instead of 200, which means you can get max profit even from 5600 caps buy
---
Dont take junk? I revive others
---
Reminder: A hip firing crank gun should probably not have an iron sight at all. Arguably, neither should the minigun. And considering the level of accuracy, "somewhere in the middle of my screen" seems to be working out for my "hip fire crank gun sniper" needs.
---
Not for me
---
Yeah I love how they’ve put a few new ones in too, like the cat heads
---
If they weigh less than 1lb per star I usually keep them
---
The stash used to be 400.... let that settle in lol
---
I've just kind of casually wandered through the game since beta and I'm lvl 158. Never really did the level grind. Havve friends that apply themselves and can be lvl 120 in 2 weeks, no exploits involved. 120 isn't close to being a ridiculous level. Keep plugging away, you'll get there.
---
based on them downvotes, i think you might be wrong
---
Didnt the drop percent get nerfed in the last update for aid specifically.
---
By then we'll have the real looter shooter, **Borderlands 3!!!!**
---
Looks cool, but I still like my camo paint. Haven't seen anyone else wearing it.
---
Did you initially hit endurance then pick an intelligence card? It still adds the point to whichever you first choose then lets you pick any card no matter the stat.
---
Yep I loved this game from.when I first  heard John Denver's voice but after it launched I'm hesitant to buy the game. It had a great ad campaign. I must have listened to take me home 100 times and I don't even really like country.
---
I just follow the trail of water. You will find one south of top of the world. Then follow the stream you will arive on a place with 3 brahmin. Build around the spawn point of the brahmin.
---
I \*still\* don't know how to activate the washer/dryer/pin thing. Someone opened the door for me instead.
---
 I think the larger problem with setting up those "perfect defenses" is when you leave the server you are on, your defenses stay there and a lot of the time the workshop is marked as owned Looong after you log off.
---
I couldn’t imagine. In fallout 4 it was unlimited. I know that is not possible here but at least to 1200 or 1500. There are things I can’t unlock and want to keep.
---
Most if the junk thieves are on the survival servers these days.
---
Not sure why I immidiatly get downvoted for helping get this garbage fight, a fighting chance. :(
---
It's actually not a bad fight, but no one understands its simple mechanics.
---
I used to wear camo most of the time, bought it right after beta, actually -))
---
Weird, it's always empty for me
---
I can’t remember the last time caps were a issue I’ve stayed above 10k for a long time only really spending them in trade deals
---
I don't think it did. I'm not about to try and find out either.
---
Not tonight...
---
The impostor is not though.
---
It's easy to tell how intelligent a man is by how stupid he thinks I am.
---
None of the features you've requested are related to adulthood or aforementioned commitments. It does however paint a solid picture of who I'm up against and thus I yield.
---
Can’t relate everytime I’ve done it it’s been a revival festival and lots of heart emotes
---
Thanks, wasn't aware of that.
---
That’s sarcasm.  I was the victim and not thrilled about it.  And to your point it was just after I revived like 5 of them.  Pricks.
---
You can say anything you want. Unfortunately for you facts aren't on your side. Unless you are going to try to explain how someone having 3 times as much ammo, stimpacks and weapons doesn't have an advantage over the person that didn't pay to have that advantage.
---
Guess it just hit the jackpot.   And by that I mean and empty jackpot.
---
Low levels should focus on pylons while people who have the greatest dps clear ads and take down the squatch once shields are down.
---
I can't take credit for the original idea but it kills me every time lol
---
I got that one and the plan for the Fixer. Probably not.
---
I renamed one of mine that lol
---
I just killed everything I saw and now I’m level 220 but I’ve seen guys double my level. It’s all about how much time you want to put in
---
😂
---
The stations aren't the problem, the application of mods is. Hotfix fir 76 tomorrow MAY fix it.
---
Yeah I’ve gotten those as well. Was wondering if there was any way after that.
---
Yesterday i accidentally shot someone cleaning up the bots after sheepsquatch. Purposely moved away to make it clear it wasnt on purpose, and 30 seconds later he starts firing away at me. Had to put him down twice for that one! (He revenged and lost 🔫😂)
---
A fair portion of players used to farm XP at Whitesprings during nuke events before they nerfed/reduced the points you could make during each kill.  At times you could level up 5 or 6 times during a single nuke event there.  It's a little more of a grind now, but probably more how it should have been in the beginning.
---
No, I just gives you an assaultron head weapon plan even though it says you get two different assaultron heads when u learn, the standard and the sheepsquatch imposter asaultron head
---
Before the xp nerfs u got 700xp for 1 ghoul at nuked ws . Easily 4-5 levels for 1 nuke zone
---
Yes i got what you said, what I meant was that the tokens will only apply to the same type of weapons. Say if I scrap a stalkers rolling pin, the tokens will have rolling pin on it so it can be used to ‘reroll’ my other rolling pins but can’t be used for other weapons such as radium rifle. I hope I’m wrong because I also stockpiled a bunch of garbage 3 stars. But I don’t think they will let me turn my junkie’s minigun into a bloodied minigun by using tokens from my tire irons.
---
I was under the impression that it was not the health but rather the damage resistance was being scaled for number of players. I think unintentional scaling from player lag might have occured because it definitely seems like the server throws hissy-fits and ignores large amounts of the damage being done to her health. 
---
Though I have definitely noticed SIGNIFICANT positive changes to server performance in the fight over the past week and a half that I have been farming her. Those performance optimizations and the community seemingly learning to use debuffs (tenderizer, cryolator, crippling, endangerol, etc...) have made a race to beat the clock in to 10-15 minute fights.
---
I'm 175 and I gotta say I haven't tried to level up in about 70 levels it just happens if you play a lot.
---
Well yeah I would imagine so.  Does anyone think you're told to do it so you can ignore it and succeed?
---
Should be though I havnt personally checked either. 
---
 
---
Its under design and balance.
---
My entire play style is geared towards grinding high level areas. Been playing since the beta and I'm level 180something or other. I see players upwards of 300 occasionally. It's the post level 75 game that you really rack up those levels... It doesn't really take too much time to level up if you're grinding out the proper areas and have a routine that keeps you full of ammo and repair materials. Even at my level I can rack up 5 or 6 levels in a couple of hours if I'm focusing all my efforts to it.
---
not useful for me as I scrap all weapons but lengedary ones which I can't.
---
Exactly. ‘Luck’ is indeed misleading but they probably couldn’t find a better word that starts with an ‘L’.  True luck, in this case RNG, can’t be configured and enhanced by user settings.
---
Probably because the favorites are bugged, at least for me. Whenever I pick up a bunch of weapons of same 'base' as my favorited item, all of them becomes favorited and it's a chore to scrap them.
---
Why not just play with us?
---
Gotta learn to let go.
---
Its' in the files but not implemented yet, there are several variations but nothing to call them for now.
---
Wtb cranberry seeds...
---
Huh. I guess that must have been done for me too! So it looks like this player helped me first!
---
Yes. It seems to be more frequent than before.
---
How is disliking and dennouncing someone who disagrees with your mere existence and writes text walls about how your life is just wrong censoring?
---
This is not just an opinion different than yours, it's someone basically saying that you shouldn't exist at worse, and that if you exist you shouldn't let anyone know at best.
---
I bet the legendary token weigh about ten pounds or something stupid like that
---
I just execute others way faster then using stems
---
I would like that too apply to the stash and your inventory as well. I have tons of rare outfits in my stash and I have to scroll through each individual item there ad well.
---
reporting back to let you (and others) know that i just got the heavy combat arms at watoga train station.
---
Best advice here. Focus your stash into a fuel reserve, not a warehouse.
---
Agree to trade it for high caps as insurance, both directions. At least then you dont lose completely if they dip and likely sniff out scammers.
---
I would take a two or even one-star item- if it was anti- armor weapon or something.  But I got a one star piece of leather and a fedora hat.   I am a pawn in the competition between the assaultron sheepsquatch and the queen competing to prove  who can drop the  shittiest loot.
---
I stop using my gauss. I can down SB and other large armour targets no probs. But I have tap fire at the Watoga bots or other small creatures. Either there’s some tomfoolery afoot or something. But an anti armour gauss should be doing 9to5 hour work on stuff.
---
What is it with meat hooks all of a sudden?
---
I feel at some point even with like 2000lbs people will eventually accumulate too much and need to prioritize. Either build a new character or reduce junk or sell off the rest for caps and go for quality over quantity. Server stability is the biggest reason for the limit though.
---
Yup. I planned it out. 400 pounds of junk, 100 in weapons, 100 in armour. 50 in aide and the other 50 in Other stuff.  End up having 150 or so at any time.
---
Just go hangout at Whitesprings for awhile, strip naked and go AFK. Somebody will do it
---
Run around naked it’s the code
---
On to the next farm. Or back to WS.
---
Ill trade 2.5k
---
Don’t let your mom find out.
---
Pride doesn't celebrate that people are gay in a void. Pride is about conmemoring the kickstart of the LGBT liberation movement years ago, and about celebrating that queer people should be able to exist without facing any kind of bigotry.
---
Companies changing their logos is just capitalizing on social movements, something that companies will always do, but only if they find it's safe enough to do so, so it's not even push for anythinh at that point.
---
Maybe some folks in /R/fo76filthycasuals would be interested.
---
Posted it there
---
Sheepsquatch*
---
Understandable but you gotta remember fo76 has slight RPG elements so you have to take the crafting and materials as part of it 
---
And is similar to borderlands as there are decent guns you have playing through just as fallout even if you don't think so.
---
Also rng is just what it is if the percentages were higher it wouldn't be so much rng more of a ratio then.
---
All I can really say is if people want an easy way to min/max their shit without much effort then this isn't their game.
---
I love just going into Appalachia and travelling finding legendarys to see what we got.
---
It's just a rush to get something even if it's trash 
---
I remember I farmed savage Lee for the dpuh for so many hours like 20 the first time I wanted it.
---
I could of accepted a lesser variant of the herald but I wanted the best so I had to grind same goes here you can have a 1* bloodied handmade and be happy or you can grind and find a bloodied explosive -20% weapon weight.
---
I know the herald is farmable off one guy but still fallout has its rng right people just need to adjust from playing easier games like anthem or destiny
---
You’re actual angel sent down from heaven to us unworthy mortals I love you 😂
---
That's cool I understand it's not for everyone but that's what makes it fun and replayable is damn I didn't get the item I wanted oh well back at it and the day you do get something nice it's like Xmas 😋 you'll get into the love of rng eventually 😎
---
Message people in your session asking them to kill you to get rid of your bounty. A high level player will help you out. I'm not sure, but I think if you turn Pacifists Mode, you aren't able to damage anyone camp so that will prevent this from happening again.
---
What system are you on?
---
It used to be when you got legendary at the end of each wave. Now that you only get one at the end of wave 3 not so much
---
So uh, I thought we were going to get an actual sheepsquatch judging by the trailer
---
Oohhhh, I want to mount that and put it on my wall. Nice
---
I'm level 240.   One. No exploits. I am simply a killing machine. Killing high level enemies is how you level up. I am never staying in one spot and  I never am always clearing out places with tons of high level enemies.   West Tek research is a great XP farm. Lots of high level super mutants.
---
While the people on my team are hanging out and goofing of at a camp, talking about their gear and plans, I am off somewhere killing shit. If you aren't killing shit, you aren't earning XP.
---
25y.o. and if You hate youtuber and his videos, because something, that is not part of videos, you are idiot. 
---
People like "oh is he really homophobic, i am going to unsucscribe!!!!"
---
Not a problem at all.
---
Not sure if this is the same issue you're having, but I was also having an issue with pipes when me and 2 other guys tried to launch nukes a few days ago. We fixed all the pipes, but the game wouldn't register them as all fixed. We worked around the bug by only having *one* person run around and fix the pipes instead of all of us... For some reason that worked and we could move on.
---
Okay thanks we will try this!
---
It doesn't sell for what it used to.  Same with raw flux, you get jack shit for it now.
---
Very true at least that way you can be sure. My friend had mentioned this when I told him about the story.
---
I was just wondering the same thing. I thought I was just having a bad roll on legendaries showing up.
---
[caption](https://imgur.com/HNxasZ0.jpg)
---
Is it really that excruciatingly hard for people to read the terminals? There are like 3 options and the last one says something like Initiate process. If you even read like a fraction of the stuff in the quest line, it should be obvious what you have to do...
---
Quest is also on a 3 hour timer, and it creates an event. the terminal will tell you to wait and come back...
---
Since when are wanted not attacked? Every Whitespring turret base I've seen, I destroyed giving me wanted status. And every time someone would attack me within minutes...
---
Last video for new patch was actualy pretty good! But lots of yours videos are about some drama, which can be told in 1minute instead of 10.
---
Okay thanks
---
Holy fuck, right?!?! I've run it 5 times today and literally every time there are maybe 2 of us actually trying to get the pylons..... Everybody is busy cluster fucking and jumping around .. They're not even taking care of adds....smh
---
Known bug caused by recent update.
---
I just want to make the comment that if you read the terminal, it literally tells you what to do... I understand that some people will be coming in that haven't done the quest because it launches a global event, but damn... like, just read people. it isn't THAT many words.
---
Some people need to l2p before screaming at Beth for everything.
---
Big time. It totally sucks that once you build a huge complicated base- well, that’s it, no more building until you destroy it. 
---
Me I think workshops should save what we build. Take one over and the last guy’s fades out and your base appears. It can’t be that complicated to implement. Or maybe it would be but it doesn’t strike me as much different than saving and loading in your camp. 
---
Anyway, I don’t get how anyone is suppose to “rebuild” Appalachia if we’re constantly tearing our camps down to try a new build idea.
---
As a Navy vet gone through SERE I can tell you that you don’t need to eat and drink as much this game depicts under extreme stress and rigorous active. Can’t say more than that.
---
Back in my day we use to walk MILES in rad storms just to get to the Super Duper Mart.
---
On pc rename is done via inspect &gt; rename
---
Repair is now an extra level deep ( modify &gt; repair)
---
The change that keeps getting me is the stash box. Used to get a mini popuplike bags and other containers. We could pick items with E or use R for transfer menu. Now its always E to access (which used to pickup my 308 from stash. So annoying)
---
It worked!
---
Vats will NOT target iss when she is stealth.
---
Glad it worked. Happy launching!
---
Or found ways to unlock all the other mounted heads
---
Lvl 180 heavy/PA build with an AAE plasma Gatling.... Can confirm you can literally clear the pond with a sweep or two of that thing
---
What is the first initial of the person that scammed you?
---
A friend and I went through the quest last night. We couldn’t get it to trigger and realized we needed the expensive part. He didn’t have the caps but I did and I said no way. I would wait to see if there was another option once more people had a chance to try it out. I felt bad but I’m glad it played out the way it did. We wouldn’t have been close to dealing with that thing at all.
---
I got the White Sheep costume from the Impostor Sheepsquatch event
---
Yeah I wore level 50 T51b with medic pump torso and it kept me alive.  It really wasn't all that hard with the group I was with.  There was a shit load of heavy weapons builds there like myself and we made pretty short work of her.  But the loot was so shitty that I don't feel motivated to do it again.
---
oh im sorry that might have been me.  if I see lower levels die I like to surprise gift the bag so it's not so bad
---
No mods.
---
I didn't even realise till I didn't have enough stuff to sell.
---
Yes. I know that and even though I'm not convinced I see your point :) And I would hate that the RP spectre to be watered down. But imo they made the system way too locked.
---
I found the last tape near the end of the wolf thing to be super chilling.
---
That’s best for single player. If you are playing in a group you likely have someone talking in your ear. Someone wanting you to get on with the rest of the quest and hurry up. It makes it tougher to read through everything and try to be thorough.
---
You have to click on the name of the special stat to browse what perks are available.  You're telling me that it dumps a point into the special just for clicking to browse? 
---
This is my third character I honestly don't remember it working that way.  I remember clicking on a special stat and browsing the cards, and if I didn't pick a perk then no points were sank into my special stat.  And why the hell would it?
---
In the upstairs terminal at the Taxidermy place, there’s two entries labeled “Unsolved”. Those might be them
---
Its bethesda prepping to sell atomic food and water in the crown sto- cough* atomic shop
---
I wish mine was AAE, just got Junkie as the other prefix, but hell, it still wrecks robot face.
---
I sell like 95% of my aid. You get a fortune for a lot of the things you cook, drugs you don’t use (the only one I keep is psycho buff), and stimpaks. 
---
I had 200 stims and 50 super stims in my inventory before survival. Pretty hard to stash them all, so I asked myself why I really ever needed more than ten on me.
---
I imagined a bed made of corn, mutfruit, and tatos, with like a soft razorgrain pillow.. for some reason.
---
The loot pool in D2 is significantly bigger than 76. 
---
Even if they had the same number of prefixes and suffixes there are just more categories of stuff. Amulet, gems, runes, boots, gloves, rings. Combined with prefix/suffixes, uniques and sets means a boat load of additional drops that Fallout 76 does not have.
---
Also, Diablo 2 has no guaranteed drops.
---
I mean, thats just the way the game goes sometimes
---
More importantly, I would say like 95% of the people I meet in adventure mode are more than helpful and nice so theres that
---
Only occasionally do I run into someone whos real petty, and then you just get petty back
---
Hahaha
---
Do you make sure you tag it?
---
I have the mascot head and the fedora, and gotta say, I love the things. That and the carry weight leg plans for my excavator. Thanks, Sheepsquatch! I beleive in you!
---
Now I want a X-01 PA.
---
I agree. I've done it once, and literally no one was bothering with the pylons. There had to be fifteen people there. Low levels, power up the pylons, die, respawn and tag him. Repeat. Let the big guns take care of Sheepsquach, focus on the bots.
---
Of course I got disconnected, but prior to that it was a free for all.
---
No
---
Good thing I wasn't implying it was a new find. :\^)
---
They're all kinda cute style; even the 51b looks huggable with his little plasma rifle.
---
We should be able to grow anything is already in the game... and have gardening plots like in FO4...
---
As of a few min ago. There is NO patch for us. It's server stability only. And if people can't tell sarcasm from my last post oh well. Grow up children.
---
As it stands the downtime is stated to be for server stability only. No fixes for any problems.
---
Like how y’all complain when WoW been doin this for a decade.
---
Would like to kno.
---
I dunno about you, but none of my weapons are visible when sheathed so why would Wolf be any different? ;)

Sorry for the delay: [Here are this weeks codes!](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbwj8y/silo_nuke_launch_codes_april_8th_14th/)
---
Ok so definitely broken then across the board it sounds like. I would have thought that this function would have been on their red route test to be honest as it's such an integral part of the game mechanics and has been in previous games. Hope they fix it soon!
---
Just did the event for the first time and we failed. I was running around like a mad man activating the pylons over and over and killing shitload of robots. But we didn't kill the assaultron somehow, I was disappointed in the others at the event lol
---
1000 caps?
---
you get the plans for it after finishing the quest (though maybe it's a random reward) and you can craft a level 50 version.
---
I don’t get one shotted, it might be two or three, but it always happens in less than a second. 
---
I hate how you think you’re fine, then, out of nowhere, huh I just keeled over, guess someone shot at me. Pvp isn’t much fun, I don’t think. It’s over before it even begins. I doubt it will change tho. Too bad you can respawn as fast as you’re killed.
---
Probably. My boyfriend did it as a joke. I thought it was pretty funny haha
---
I have an upvote for someone that knows (PS4) one or more answers below.
---
1. How to select my entire house to do such a thing as OP is talking about.
---
2. Any way to push CAMP items away from me (or pull them closer, as the situation warrants). Similar to one of the mouse mappings on PC.
---
Wtf you wont get much from doing that but if you rev people not only do you get stuff for doing the event but you get da happy feels.
---
Respect
---
ok thanks for the heads up
---
They didnt "allow" duping. And there is no God mode type armor. Name literally anything and I can tell you multiple weaknesses.
---
Did you manage to do any damage to the SBQ or sheepy? You dont get loot if you dont tag it.
---
Or, if you did tag it, sometimes loot takes time to generate.  It has gotten better with recent patches, but still can be slow on occasion, SBQ being a big offender.
---
You probably have an out of date mod
---
Your info is outdated. You drop like 1 stimpack and a rad x now.
---
Yes they did.
---
Hmm, I'll take a look though I thought I updated them. Thank you.
---
I definitely did tag it at least once, and even when the loading stopped I did not get any items. And no exp at all.
---
I get that but I am I asking for too much quality
---
 over quantity. Just a little more
---
Yeah, I was level 20, and Stimpacks were more than strong enough for me to do the pylons and survive. 
---
As melee, I had some issue with the Eyebots though...
---
Before the game came out I thought we would have to build perk loadouts for certain builds to work well in a team and I originally planned to make a building loadout
---
I love the new change. And now you can get more caps back if you buy, say, a 2.500 plan. You can get credit above the previous 200c (say 450c) and you can happily continue to sell more :)
---
Legendary Abraxo Cleaner because ppl drop junk.
---
Yes, this is a new issue.  Though some people have gotten certain mods to work.  I myself can't get any to work, too.
---
what lvl are you if i may ask?
---
I just hit level 30 yesterday.
---
Gt tigglebooty, msg me.
---
U got one? I'll pay 1k psn epicduck00
---
Well when you put it like that...
---
But but but.... They had to have a full assassins sentinel BOS and tse handmade, otherwise how did i die with my unyielding serendipity melee? /s
---
Thank you, most players can't see that when items are duped and create an unattainable meta, it gets the nerf bat. Two shot explosive, prime example. These sentinel builds, or bloodied builds, are going to get a nerf too. Probably making serendipity no loner work in pvp will be a good start.
---
hmm well as far as I know you have to at least do 1% of thier total health to get credit but if you are lvl 30 you should at least be doing that
---
What’s the lumberjack outfit? I’ve never seen it. I guess that’s a no.
---
A buddy of mine got the excavator calibrated shock plans from it.   Kinda worth hearing him get it.  But I agree, definitely fix the star shit with apparel or weapons
---
I had the whole game crash while lockpicking a safe during Back on the Beat. Not sure what happened there.
---
Hmm maybe I did not do more than 1% for some monsters, but the one time I fought a SBQ I definitely did.
---
 They benefit from both melee and unarmed perks, double dipping, and they've got great strength scaling
---
Sorry, I read the W And H reversed and thought you were selling!
---
Its alright lol
---
Really sorry, I must have gotten insanely lucky somehow, a follow up attempt with a weapon mod failed, looks like this is a significant issue.
---
Thanks for the confirmation, seems to be all "Moddable" equipment.
---
And it's a serious issue there as there is no recipe for crafting the calibrated shocks!
---
would have been nice to have a couple nights ago. RIP Firebreathers Helmet
---
Not Oxhorn, the other YouTuber he was talking about. 
---
Oxhorn is clearly ashamed of his past comments and views so bringing it up now only to defame and shame him on something he's clearly matured over is silly.
---
Sentinal assassin isn't as good as everyone thinks. 
---
Here are some of the weaknesses that absolutely melt them.
---
1. Deep dish gamma gun
---
2. Railway rifle
---
3. Handmade with thank killer perk
---
4. Shotguns with enforcer
---
5. Melee attacks with talons which kills quickly with bleed damage.
---
6. Bloodied sneak attacks with any single shot rifle
---
7. Bloodied deathclaw gauntlet
---
8. Any Gatling Plasma
---
9. 50 cal machine gun with stagger perk
---
10. Full Auto Tesla Rifle
---
11. Plasma Grenades 
---
12. Nuke Grenades
---
And there are more. People are just crying because they cant beat that armor with their favorite weapons and would actually have to change the way that they play based on the enemy that they are fighting.
---
Sounds like the old (Pre-Patch 6) Excavator PA weight glitch has returned.  
---
Thanks for the detail, will document and report tomorrow.
---
You pick a special point, then you pick a perk. Simple as that.
---
When you pick a special point, it shows you the perks for that special stat, because you just chose to get a new slot for that stat. But obviously you can pick a perk from any stat, which you do by hitting R1 or whatever. So, initially you were backing out of the perk selection and choosing a new special stat to see new perks, and this time you were hitting R1 (or whatever). 
---
The perk system is honestly pretty wonky, but after three characters you should probably have the hang of it.
---
Was any of this recent?
---
Can confirm, had this happen on my LMG tonight, would reload fire a couple rounds, then reload again, it is actually consuming the ammo,
---
In 15 minutes I managed to "eat" 3,000 rounds of 308, which usually lasts me several days
---
Death to tyrants.
---
I've been playing on off since beta and reached lvl 75 or so. I've since then created 3 different characters to try different builds. Lost interest in the game since stash is constantly full, costs an arm and a leg to repair and craft, and scrapping stuff only gives a few steel even with scrapper.
---
 Mainly only login play for 30 minutes after a patch to see if there are any fixes or noticeable changes. Still play Fallout NV and Fallout 4 though.
---
Kind of. Just that quitting the game is much easier than leaving the country and less complicated ;). But yeah go for the extreme and good attempt at trying to make what I said political lol. If quitting a game to you equates to leaving the country then yeah you may have issues.
---
V.A.T.S isn't targeting not-hostile scorchbeasts. Kinda big problem for opening shot instigating sneak crit builds.
---
Happens on PC too
---
+karma
---
Hey since you're into doing stuff like that. Is there a possibility to check for damage buffs? I honestly wouldn't know whether theres some scaling to SBQ or not but since so many people claim it, as well as one person down here too.
---
What about the possibily that you actually gain a damage buff against SBQ the fewer people you are? Perhaps silly to ask in the first place.
---
Anyways keep up the good work!
---
Why can't you blueprint your CAMP structure?
---
Why can't you blueprint your main CAMP structure?
---
When loading into Lewisburg right after coming back from a crash the dirt textures turned pale. Like it looked like it was snowing in the ash heap was pleasant looking but the textures didn’t go back to dirt after a while like it usually does. I stayed 10 minutes before going back to the main menu and back into the game. That seems to fix it Incase it happens. Was playing on the Xbox one X
---
The healing item crafting challenge was a pain. You need pharmacist 3 to be able to craft antibiotics. All for 10 atoms.
---
Sound like a Gauss rifle?  
---
I've been having an issue with my Gauss where occasionally the sound it makes while fully charged remains after I switch weapons and is only cleared when I pull the Gauss back out and it realizes it's at 0% charge.
---
Apparently the quest was deleted till u talk to biv again but also my data log for the quest is gone too but he gave me the list for the nukashine and said all the dialog
---
Same happened to me last night, first time at event, before I even started the new questline.  I still had a blast tho.  I logged in first time post patch, saw the event message, thought why not (didn’t know anything about it yet) and joined. I was like wtf? Then saw the BIG “ activate pylons!” message.   Duh.  Fairly obvious to me what to do.  I only died once.
---
The chaos was glorious!  
---
9/10 will do it again when I find it active
---
It’s not just for wet armour, I bought s mod for my gauss rifle and I can’t attach it :(
---
wait, railway rifle?? what’s special about it?
---
Ty
---
What is that outfit?
---
Yup!  See:

If you're on PC and have made a custom.ini file then you need to update "sResourceArchive2List" under the "[Archive]" section with "SeventySix - 03UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 03UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 03UpdateTextures.ba2" in order to see the latest.
---
It staggers almost without fail and Sentinal armor doesn't work while staggered. I had a guy 2 shit me at a train station like 10 times with a railway recently even though I have almost all of my perks sunk into damage resist as well.
---
Bless 'em
---
good to know
---
another one: does sentinel work when you crouch?
---
i know it works when you jump..
---
While at it:  
---
It would be nice to be able to change the Holotape language seperate. In german there are soooooo many unnatural pauses and I'd like to know how it is in other languages.
---
Definitely should
---
This system will unlock the ability to be over encumbered AF as people reset to lvl.1 lose their carry weight perks/ armor effects and realize they are walking around with 800lbs of gear.
---
Curious as to the perks used on a railway rifle, just standard rifle perks?
---
I’ve been revived more in that one spot the last two days than I have in the remainder of fo76
---
And the bots in the silos had good XP payout too, and since they continually spawn, that's a way to not only farm XP but aluminum, fusion cells, and steel, especially back in the hey day of TSE when they could all be one-shot for the most part.
---
True 👍
---
I am having the same problem, I really hope this gets more attention because we can't even play the questline...
---
Best practice right here. Start squirreling away any lightweight 3 stars you can find.
---
Me too anyway to get them back guys?
---
Some people say that it does but I have tested it with a friend and 10 out of 10 tests showed that when crouching I took full damage from the opposing player.
---
They do sell mods, I bought 2 for my excavator armour.
---
It really is sad the kind of brain dead dummies roaming around with us. Sleep is important people.
---
Yes. It is affected by rifle perks.
---
My grandma is Paul McCartney
---
New annoying prime weapons bug! When I spawn with a prime weapon equipped, It equips the standard ammo. I need to switch weapons and back before I can use my prime weapon. PLEASE FIX!
---
Cool I’m not much for pvp but when you got the caps to spend no harm in picking up a new gun
---
Yep. I got my alt to level 50 in about 2 days running WS and Watoga.
---
So far, the highest I've seen is a 450.  My main is 270, my alt is 118. Have a friend who's two characters make mine look like slackers as he's constantly farming ghouls at WS or the SBQ.
---
Yeah. I'm looking for one.
---
Resets every time. The bots will respawn I'm cleared areas too if someone new enters the silo behind you.
---
I don't use the Gauss Rifle so I'm not sure if we're talking about the same sound. If I find one I'll see if the sounds are similar. 
---
The Lever Action makes a sound similar to an energy weapon.
---
I wanna say greasers jacket? I don't think that's what it's called though. I'll respond tomorrow, it's an atom store item plus a black beanie.
---
Thanks for all the responses. Do you need to fully spec into a build now to be efficient? I mean 3+3+3 perks in rifleman for instance?
---
You usually press space to scrap and space to confirm. In this way the combo space space cancel the scrap. it is logical, in its own way
---
all you have to do is get is the keycard from the cargo bot, got inside the silo you want, get it ready to lunch the nuke, google the nuke code for the silo and lunch. It get easier i for one went from 30 minutes to maybe now 10 or less.
---
Wtf lmao it look me literally more than 2 hours to do the whole thing. Do you just run in a fuck all them robots and just launch it?? Or are you like killing them all that fast lol
---
you need to use the keycard in the computer. but if someone already did the event u need to wait 2hs
---
what do you want on it?
---
They’ve already addressed this and said it will come soon but they need to write some new functionality into the game first. Be patient.
---
I got it upgraded but thanks for offering ❤️
---
Does anyone know when they will be increasing the stash limit?
---
Above a certain size, the blueprint function no longer works. I have to store all decor and furniture and half of the building before it will allow me to select the structure. It seems to be a known issue as of a few patches ago.
---
Dang lol I don’t think I’d be doing it anytime soon again
---
&gt;  She basically wound up questioning his guidance and defying him.  
---
He forbade her from using nukes on the queen, she did as he commanded, and was killed for it. I fail to see how that is defiance.  In their last conversation they are on good terms.   He tells her that communications are breaking down and they will no longer be able to speak. His final words to her are him telling her she trusts her judgment.
---
lol well it helps that I can one shot/two everything outside from SBs, but onething that will help a lot is the mainframe core, picking them up and repairing them before hand will save you a ton of time.
---
I use perk that helps guys that I revive but mostly prefer to die
---
feels bad as a medic
---
It looks very majestic sir
---
Sounds like a great idea!
---
np
---
RNG usually results in a consistent experience though. Swinging wildly to each end of the spectrum dosnt consistently happen.
---
Yeah, nice it's a very important topic and a key game mechanic that would hugely improve trading. I really like that idea and have many people talk about the original fallout' s trading system and it does sound like exactly what I was trying to get at. I imagine the regular trade menu in f76 however with a space in the middle like the container you said and it would highlight the offered items from each player, and then, like you described, the Offers are negotiated before both players can accept to confirm the trade and swapping of items. Also, I think people should be able to swap between each of these boxes so they can still request and decline items
---
Isn't this a feature that was in F4? I remember that either your favourites didn't show up in the list or it warned you.
---
I had a lvl 5 pole hook drop from a lvl 6 scorched at the greenhouse along from Ohio river adventures once but haven’t had one drop there since so I think they are rare, they come as legendary too though and I’ve had a bloodied and ghoul slayers pole hook drop from whitesprings ghouls but I’ve never seen a plan at any vendors.
---
I can like 5 shot them if I’m lucky hahaha What level are you? Lol and I know I still have some in my inventory just in case I do it again.
---
The amount of times I have gone straight to the event from scavenging/looting... only to end up dying and watching someone else scoop up my dropped junk right before my eyes.... problem is there isn’t really enough time to fast travel back to CAMP just to stash your stuff before joined the event if you’re out in the middle of exploring
---
&gt; You turn in legendaries for new legendaries. More stars means higher chances at better loot. How they go about that is the question but I can say with confidence we're not going to be rerolling anything.
---
That's not what I heard. Todd says you can use the tokens to "somewhat customise or roll for the legendary you want". Which definitely sounds like there will be some sort of rerolling of existing legendaries.
---
lvl 105 melee/none auto rifle build.
---
yeah for silos I got pure melee
---
Now all they need is one for when your selling items. Also my A button sticks so I’ve accidentally sold one or two of my best weapons to vendors
---
I thought this happened to me too, it was super weird.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQr5ifz-hsA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQr5ifz-hsA)
---
Start this video at 13 minutes and it explains it.
---
I think 1 hour long cool down would be a good compromise.
---
I'd be fine with that.
---
But that’s his point... the chance of getting a reasonably strong 3 star legendary is astronomically low. The drop rates alleviate this quite well if you know where to farm but even then some players will farm for a year before they get something good. I also wouldn’t say the effects or weapons are balanced well at all so unfortunately tons are total junk
---
Consistency across the menus would be great. In every other menu(on Xbox) the B button is for cancel. Another example is inventory management , on Xbox in the pip boy you use your joystick to move from item category to item category and in the trade and junk menus you use the bumpers to change category. 
---
I’ll have to be careful with this one, but great having the prompt
---
I got some adhesive that you need.
---
(JK)
---
🥺🥺🥺 maaaannn, I’m trying to level up my melees cause in fallout 4 that’s all I used. I practically 1 hit everything lol I loved it so much. Haha it’s hard for me to find good melee weapons. I’m level 65 and my best melee is the Instigating Deathclaw Gauntlet at 189 damage.
---
Thanks.
---
&gt;Based on how the quest (currently?) ends, it'll be pretty obvious what happened to him specifically, but my guess is that they might just elaborate on this questchain further in a soon-to-come update. 
---
Yeah I meant how the game gives at least in beginning different possibities to the player to think what could all the stuff be behind the questline. Like it implies several things, not directly pointing at anything, leaving the player to discover it. I have done only the quest in the first building and then went  to check some playground with clue paper notes. I like how it's somewhat obscure.
---
Come to think of it I probably shouldn't go to the event site before I do the quest myself. I tried once with a low level mule, but then the game stuck while I had the map on, and I had to close the game.
---
I mean obviously many things said here implies and tells what's going on here. But I haven't actually see it, so it might be better to do the quest normally until I get to the event part of it, since there's no badass weapon or stuff like that to try to farm off the random event rewards.
---
What system?
---
Yeah.  Before the patch, hydration would deplete similar to food but after the patch it feels like hydration depletes nearly twice as fast.  Today I gave in and added purified water to my favorites wheel.
---
Well, so far I haven’t gotten anything to increase rad damage, including bloodied and headshots, so I doubt it.
---
Yep the TS and explosive effects got nerfed hard about 2+ months ago, mainly because their combination was so powerful.
---
But shotguns and to some degree other weapons that fire multiple projectiles, or have really high rate of fire like miniguns, do pretty huge damage with explosive effect, due to the way explosive damage is calculated for each of the projectiles.
---
Seems to be going anywhere from 12-20k
---
“Grinding” isn’t the whole experience for some people man. Some build, some pvp, some just keep exploring and questing. I certainly wouldn’t get some god rolled handmade and just drop the game in a week. They are going to be adding new content for a long time which is the perfect place to use that item. What would be the point of grinding for months to get something incredible just to hit eject and trade it in at GameStop...
---
Yeah, this seems like something that should've been included from the start. I mean, c'mon...
---
I too enjoy this game dispite the flaws and honestly it may have server issues but when i come across them i just take a break for a few hours and it gets back to normal. Im glad you enjoy the game and by the way what build are you?
---
Thanks, now I know I can get rid of the level 30 one I got.
---
Kind of your own fault for hauling all that round
---
SPOILER TAG GODDAMMIT
---
Excavator armor can carry more than any other.
---
You probably should have noted what platform you play on for this to have been any help
---
And anybody knows where is that damn costume besides of shop?
---
Sbq isn't guaranteed 3 stars either.
---
11/04/19
---
Had the Daily to wear formal wear while level up and also a unstupple costume while level up.
---
I was wearing *GRAB OF MYSTERY* and *ENCLAVE OFFICER HAT* and did them both in 1 Level up just so you know!
---
By re-reading the poster? I have tried but no luck
---
The cave crickets are what get me... can’t stand bugs irl and those giant jumping bastards freak me out all the time
---
I have killed the SBQ I would say 70+ times and have never once failed to get a 3 star from her. I could be wrong but form my experience I have never received anything less than a 3 star from the queen.
---
Same, you like bloodied stuff?
---
I can't remember honestly so I couldn't report  them sadly
---
Thats what I fucking thought too! No one said anything about the bitch being some type of mini raid boss that takes 3 hours to respawn! And god *forbid* you end up in a shitty group!
---
I've never got a 3 star from her.
---
Meh. I dont play that way
---
Scrapping was not much of an issue, due to ledgendaries mostly used. Dropping them however was, has this been included?
---
Damn, got a Bloodied 3* railway rifle haha
---
The Whitesprings Vendors &amp; the faction Vendors at WS currently do not.
---
I'm going to assume you've been part of her fight like 2 or 3 times when her loot bus bugged.
---
SERVE... AND... PROTECT
---
Lol. I appreciate it but I'm looking for like an amti armor, two shot, or maybe a quad.
---
In the last week I've fought her 5-6 fees and got at most a 2 star.
---
Lol that's selling for 12-20k
---
You won't find it for anywhere close to 1k atm
---
Oh namedropping? Not that either of us are going to prove shit, I am also a navy vet, and I \*have\* sweated it out in 100-130F humid conditions that sucked balls (either standing guard, or more dreadfully needlegunning non skid and painting after). Did I eat and drink as much as this game? No, this game's food and drink are hardly quantified. That said, I ate and drank in far excess of what I do normally outside the navy because the environment and exercise called for it. This game would call for more, not less food and drink to survive because the conditions are just that potentially harsh. 
---
Being in the civilized world simply does not require as much nutrition and hydration as being exposed to the elements (not that we fight deathclaws, supermutants and the like)
---
Hmmm. No one in my group has ever gotten less than 3 stars so that's weird man. Even so I shouldn't be getting a 1 star lever action from a boss this hard.
---
Dosent make sense the event is still going on
---
I found a lot in the costume shop at the top of the map next to abbies bunker, I also have a spare I don't need.
---
I feel you, it's a beaut for those bloodied PVP builds haha
---
1- do you mean like a full build budget camp? You can try placing your camp at a new place and access Stored blueprints. Depending on how you’ve built it, it may be one huge bp or several smaller ones. Good luck placing it. Virtually impossible. Best to make small sections and snap them together. Still very difficult to do. In fact, just forget it and rebuild from scratch. Seriously. Otherwise, L1 will select everything in a freestanding structure so long as it doesn’t exceed the blueprint limit. It’s a small limit, expect it to fail if it’s over say, 10-15% of the max budget. 
---
2- select the item you’re going to place- hold X. Now the left stick push and pull the item (or entire blueprint) along the x-axis. While holding X, use L1 to raise it, R1 to lower it. If you try to use these controls to raise or lower or move the piece outside the camp boarder or thru objects, the piece won’t move. Aim for an open, in camp area and get the piece mostly where it needs to be. 
---
Is that clear?
---
True
---
ah h2 melee, I mainly use an 2*All Rise that does more than enough,
---
focus on your damage perks for the build you want first and then the QoL perks, would be my recomendation.
---
and yes FO4 is an amazing game
---
Very much so! Upvote achieved. Thanks!
---
I gathered that was what happens.  I had half a dozen L100+ player turn up the moment I kicked it off.  Let me assure you I was very relieved as Im only L70.
---
Yep, and theres like a 6% chance if that, of an imposter peice dropping
---
Hence rarity = Value
---
I'm just giving you the heads up you're gonna be constantly laughed at trying to buy it for 1k ATM 🤷
---
For mine? No idea, railway rifles just got a buff and I'm sitting on a Bloodied 50% limb damage reduced weight one
---
yes (altho you rarely pay 2400c unless you have no CHA or Hard Bargain 3 bonuses)
---
Thank you! I don't drop nukes often but when I do I like a good pic of my personal fallout :)
---
I know for a fact I can't put my Raider PA helmet Internal Database mod on.
---
Hmmm. I'll hit you up tomorrow with an offer.
---
I'm also getting a ton of infinite respawn glitches and invisible enemies as of these last two patches. Game is really unstable now.
---
If you tap 10 mm sub once it fires 3 bullet burst.. idk why ppl demand it for this weapon when it already works like that.
---
Dang well theres people laughing at the ones who pay high prices for them
---
I’ve got them as cheap as 1750 plus the added bonus of nearly 400 caps I can sell stuff to effectively making them under 1400
---
You are correct.
---
Are you on PS4 Or Xbox? And what’s a QoL? Lol sorry I don’t know the slang for fallout haha
---
That always seems to be the combo when a Bloddied 3\* drops.  I have the same mods on my 3\* Railway rifle.
---
Thank you fellow wastelander! I will check out soon. If I could not find one I would knock your door :)
---
Stop hoarding.. its more then enough now, used to be 400!
---
Ah, weird. What do you value yours at? Out of curiosity
---
&gt; I still didn't drink or eat as much as I do in this game.
---
Yes, and you did so in a controlled environment. You didn't have to bloody sweat it out, nor face radiation burns, nor exercise out in the wastes at crazy temperatures and humidity. You were not exposed to the elements, and have no need for the extra required hydration and calorie consumption.
---
FO is a fictional world exposed to the potentially harsh environments regularly with little to no sleep, simulating relatively easymode food &amp; drink requirements, and an accelerated in game time mechanic. Your personal sob story is irrelevant. You live in the comforts of civilization, not the untamed wilderness. You have little to no exposure to the elements that would otherwise rob you of energy and hydration. Also, none of us IRL are fighting deathclaws and supermutants. You seem to have missed that part.
---
Hell, have you seen the before and after pictures of the naked and afraid series? Those people lose double digit pounds over the course of a few weeks because of the calorie deficit. That's actual burning of stored food from actual survivalists. Hell yes they'd eat as much as they could, if they could.
---
Well in that case Bethesda needs to get on that, disappointing really, i was actually hoping to try this myself.
---
I was planning on posting this for April fools, but you guys are alright.

I think I know what you mean, like in Fallout 4 if you held X it would select Everything attached to it and you could rotate it. You can’t do that here. You have to place from a blue print. To rotate your entire base you could replace your Camp, which will store everything (hopefully) as one blue print. But you’ll almost never find a good spot to place it if it’s large or complicated. And just keep your finger crossed that some item you’ve placed isn’t ‘floating’, for half a dozen nebulous reasons, this rendering the entire structure unplaceable. 
---
If you want a huge portable base, build many small blueprints that can attach to each other. Expend to spend hours of trial and error getting this to work. When it does it’s pretty neat. But it’s easier to build from scratch anytime you’re going larger than a 2x2 foundation.
---
DC?
---
I’ve fought her over 200 times and it’s just RNG. I’ve gotten 1 star wood armor, 2 star legendaries and 3 star stuff too. You might have gotten really good RNG idk but just because it’s only been one way for you doesn’t mean that’s the truth for everyone just fyi bruh.
---
Don't know if it was fixed in the patch, but it also doesn't reduce the negative effects of the Grounded mutation even though the Pip Boy screen says otherwise. In patch 7 it was still a flat 50% decrease to your energy damage.
---
Alrighty!
---
Hmm, Might just keep my Quad Tesla now...
---
I play tested Borderlands 3, in the 30 or so hours I played it, it was incredibly enjoyable. Everyone is in for a great time with the new cast.
---
I can't speak for regular + ultracite laser rifles, but my gatling plasma, gat laser, and ultracite gat laser seem fine. 
---
If you put on a beam splitter mod on recently, that'll greatly decrease the overall time between repairs.
---
GUNS GUNS GUNS. And ordenance too. Well, everything and then some, really.
---
Yeah I was muling stuff here, mostly 2-3 star crap to Purveyor but all the stuff I was transferring to mule, was already dumped on the container. Im prorbably going to try to trade that other shotgun and hopefully the revolver too, because I just got IE shotgun to replace them both. But that will only spare like 15 lbs or so.

During most of my gameplay I've not use PA at all outside of nuke zone where it's needed. But about a month ago I finally went to make the excavator quest, found out about the weight glitch it has and how much it practcally does, and now just can't make do without. I really hope they fix it so I would be less tempted to use any PA except when needing.
---
They could just streamline event FT by lowering reward caps and get rid of event FT fees altogether. This will make events more attractive, for obvious reasons, by being cheaper (but not by much) and act as relays for players to TP to and do the events since they're in the way anyway even if they just use event FT to go somewhere elses.
---
Fuuuuuuuck lol
---
I found one in Allegheny Asylum a.k.a. Fort Defiance.
---
Communist did filters on books.  Liberty prime seeing this post: "*Democracy is the essence of good. Communism, the very definition of evil.*"
---
It really is sad, and I can’t imagine that lead champagne has a use other then to strengthen that attack.  
---
Hey I bet nobody’s tried it since the patch, you could be the first?!!!!
---
Lol. Obama was against gay marriage why are you crediting him?
---
There's some notes on the corkboard in Calvin van Lowe's room that start side-quests; a couple of them drop plans for some mounted creatures, but I don't know about the rest of them.
---
Yep, works again.
---
Yeah I wasn't sure if they are in same NPC group so they would mind you shooting them.
---
I know you were helped already, but if you were on PC, I'd make you pay in teddy bears. Nope, don't want caps, go hunt teddy bears!
---
Yes sor.
---
Still worth it, but yes.
---
I don’t know why people keep trying to justify 800 by saying it used to be 400. 😂
---
400 was terrible, 800 is bad. 
---
I hope they managed to make it at least 1400-1600 once they’ve optimised the servers more.
---
im on xbox
---
QoL= quality of life. none damage related perk(radsponge, travel agent, etc.)
---
I do use them, but I did my build how I want it first and then the other perks, it does sucks at times but now I can switch depending on the sutiation I might find myself.
---
This made me happy.
---
So die. Lol. You are my spirit animal.
---
I think if they just added voice for these gestures and phrases it would work great and people would use them.  Even add them in foreign languages...people would buy them.  
---
The problem is that the stuff they have now is ambiguous and not of great use.
---
I got a 3\* Tesla Rifle, but I guess I was just lucky.
---
I'll have to try that.  I wish that simply little 'hi' wave was toggleable when standing.
---
People will come i did it couple times and didn't fail it even once. I have enough dmg to kill him in like 20sec (after he will use health regen) and I'm tough enough to tank him what's most likely helps. Basically you need 3 people with good build to take him down easily. I'm not sure if it's possible solo... Maybe it is with enough chems.
---
oh not at all. i thought we were talking about weapons? i mean who crafts a non legendary weapon and uses that as their main weapon?
---
Beyond high level enemies having higher health and DR, I do think there is a little bit of a damage penalty for being underleveled. 
---
Radrats are just tanky ok? They're giant 2 foot rats!
---
I'm very rarely getting 3 star from sbq, have more luck with 3 star ghouls. Sbq almost always gives me 2 star armour piece.
---
If events where 10 caps or something like that i would spend all my time jumping from event to event. Spending 40 caps then to arrive when its over gets annoying really fast
---
“Why the hell would it?” Because you selected that special stat to begin with lol! 
---
You start out with an open a lot in each special so if you’re a min maxer sometimes you won’t level a special past 1 but still need to select a perk card for it. Also you get perk cards in perk packs so if you already have the card you need but just need another special point in that tree, then you can select a card in another tree to plan ahead for your build.
---
Seriously stop blaming Bethesda for something that’s pretty self explanatory especially if you’ve made 3 different characters before, the complaining is weak.
---
Is fixer dmg the same as combat rifle?
---
I kinda liked saying "ohh, some techncial data!"
---
LOL
---
Hahaha, 120 isn't ridiculous. I saw a 712 the other day. 
---
 I'm level 110? Or something. Just have like 500+hours under my belt. I'd say I'm a very slow leveler.
---
This would be a really cool idea. Doesn’t have to be an over the top things either. Like do ITV normal. And have a live thing the next day explaining it in detail and what.
---
Probably because this should have been there since launch.
---
Marsupial was my best friend during that fight lol.
---
Yeah it has a hanging animation and some of its attacks are different but walking is very similar if not the same animation
---
It really makes no sense why they released when they did. They are not beholden to shareholders. All they did was tarnish their name and lose revenue.
---
Thank you for the response...I'd welcome any additional feedback for my request
---
All 10 of my laser and plasma weapons are fine. The two shots break a little faster but other than that they are fine. Keep in automatics break quicker. Had to explain this many a time.
---
Np.
---
Especially given the fact that other people have apparently been able to grow anything.
---
I've honestly always thought that the "Repair all" option given by the interaction with the CAMP was supposed to do that but it was bugged.
---
You can find one in a building, which is at or next to workshop, which itself is on a beach of the dried lake.
---
I will buy it if on PC 😅
---
It probably won’t be so bad in a weeks time. It did just drop yesterday, everyone’s trying to do it.
---
Is a mayor issue coming from a big company. If you can live with it it´s alright, for me it´s like they are having a laugh with your money
---
You can still drop a favorited weapon. Just did yesterday. It was even the active weapon even if it wasn't drawn.
---
Make sure you tag any legendary mob after they mutate. It counts the fight over again as if it was a new mob.
---
There is a train station near the town where the quest takes place. :) I stashed most of my stuff there after getting a big haul.
---
Too bad 76 is not moddable :(
---
You're telling me you're not just spamming the scrap button on the weapons tab when you're carrying 20+ short hunting rifles?
---
I mean, if a bigass company as Bethesda can even put average looking graphics... I wouldn´t blame if this was made by a minor company. What pisses my off is that they are lazy and they fucked really hard with this game. It´s still fun with friends? yes. Worth 60 bucks? No more than 20
---
Before i restarted (im dumb) my combat rifle looked just like that at lvl 20. No idea this is im the game!
---
I managed to scrap that at about lvl 60 - 70 or something. You show restraint!
---
i had problems repairing my PA as well, acted like it did fixed it, took my mats and everything, but the status bar never changed. Im hoping is just a visial bug, but I think it is not.
---
Whitespring vendors would be your best bet.
---
Totally agree with you, I haven´t said the opposite. But it makes me nervous, a company like this shouldn´t be able to launch things like Fallout 76 as they did. The game is not worth 60€ by any chance.
---
Rip haha
---
As a low level, I also took the pylons when others weren’t (the damage seems to scale, as a Stimpack was more than enough to keep it from killing me), and reviving those who were down.
---
Focus on reviving the other pylon people! If they die, it resets the activation.
---
(PC) Since last patch 8.
---
Found Scorched walking upside down at Harpers Ferry, just after entering the first doorway, after fast travelling there, where there is usually 3 mobs. I was wondering why I was taking damage. Looked down to see if there was a trap on the ground, but instead saw the bottom soles of a pair of shoes. Kited it over to a wooden platform and it was walking upside down under the platform, and then killed it. Shortly after 2 more upside down scorch attacked. Later, in the middle of the town I was attacked by Scorched running sideways on the ground.
---
Couple of times I have been to Wotoga since patch, all the ordinary level 50 robots are acting like they have stimpacks. I normally one or two shot kill them, but they would not die, they just kept healing.
---
Appalachian Antiques, inside, first floor, down back where all the shelves and TV are located. Textures screw up, a squarish pixelated mess. The screwed up textures move around while you turn on the spot and there is a narrow pathway directly in front of you that is clear of the corruption. Move away from that specific area and everything is fine.
---
Thanks for all your good work.
---
The flatwoods vendor can sell it. So can the Morgantown and Grafton ones
---
Dickheads man, they’re everywhere.
---
Sadly not yet.
---
That sounded an awful lot like the BFF lvl 100 Colonel
---
Yep same.
---
I have spent a lot of my gaming life in fallout..I love the republic of dave... andale....and so much more..I would like nothing more than for this game to succeed
---
As someone who owns a full set of Sentinel/ Assasins and Cavalier/Assasins I understand your point, but I also sympathize with those who say it needs to be nerfed. Yes there are legitimate counters to these armors but there are no other legendary effects that require counters besides sentinels and cavaliers. 
---
As far as Sentinels effect goes it unfortunately benefits a player most when they’re camping an area. I’ve taken out groups of 4 players solo because of this gear while taking minimal damage, and while they’re build might not have been completely optimized for PvP i still find that to be a little bit OP. 
---
There are definitely players who can take me out with good builds and 1* Bloodied pipe pistols but if I see them first then I win every time even if they have 4 pieces but I have all 5 of sentinels/Assasins. 
---
TL;DR just because there are counters to something doesn’t mean it’s not OP, there are no other legendary effects besides Sentinels/Cavaliers that require specific counters.
---
Just vatscrit em in the head and they are gone
---
Just no one will tell you that intelligence boost exp gained (yes i know not from the quests)
---
the responders vendor bot on the WS, has all the excavators mod plans you could want/need.
---
Rule 10 was enforced for like an hour then the mods forgot about it lmao
---
So they will send you away 1sec before boss die.
---
- Having the layout inside memorized is a HUGE help. It's easy to get turned around in the early sections down there the first couple of times.  
---
- Picking the Lvl 3 lock and hacking the Lvl 3 terminal in the reactor room let's your bypass the miniature "Powering Up" portion. 
---
- As already mentioned, having the cores already made is a time saver.  Bethesda was even nice enough to help us with this and make them "Misc" items instead of junk that gets stashed when you use "Stash All".
---
- Being well specced for your build is the biggest thing. My first run through was with a half-assed build with non-legendary weapons and it was misery. As I refined my build and got better gear, it was much easier. My alt runs it without power armor as his build was planned out much better.  
---
If you're on PS4 and want help, HMU.
---
Yeah.  You don't know how mob control works.
---
Still at Grafton Town, and as mentioned the plans do say Excavator.
---
Mods will scrap to Black Titanium so that you know they are for Excavator.
---
their is always and ass hole that will ruin your game experiance with some shit like that.
---
Same as borderlands you don't think a 94% sham is an easy drop. Bro there's people that have played for 7 years and never got one to drop legit in game. But no one complained as much as this
---
Is that actually useful for you or you’re some sort of wasteland pedophile?
---
yes, i sure did see that as well
---
Yeah same but still a good thing to have
---
Great, the new top tier melee weapon is one where the programmer forgot to uncheck an weapon-type box so it functions as two types. Way to go geniuses. Par for the course.
---
I've done it 3 times, and every time I got a 3 star legendary and didn't burn through 1000 stimpaks. I guess I'm just lucky.
---
I wish i could get a lever action legendary.. All I'm getting is shitty gatling guns, or hunter/mutant slayer armour pieces
---
Yeah I definitely felt like one after that I'll be honest haha.
---
They are using the "You have to act now, limited edition" thing. Which is bogus because they won't let us market the items for caps or even share them. The majority of the clothing items are obtainable in game.
---
It’s higher... I have retired my old lvl 50 rifle because the lvl 30 Fixer does more damage.
---

---
yes it happens to me, i think for 2 or 3 weeks I cant get on charlie at all. always crash to dashboard.
---
I didnt check, but who drops weapons?
---
Does the event have to be activated or will it auto activate like the other events do?
---
Farm the event
---
At least show us a timer in terminal!!! That will be helpful and less confusing for people trying to finish quest line.
---
I would love to know if i can activate it in like 15 minutes or 2 hours and 15 minutes that kinda makes a difference.
---
I just gave him tree fiddy the week bafoh
---
Same reason as when I made a post about how in a past patch if your gun broke you could select it in your hot bar and still use it, they view anything that’s “exploitative” as being on the same level as duping which is BS. 
---
My example I get why some might downvote even tho it effects no ones gameplay negatively as this was even before survival servers, but for yours I honestly couldn’t say. You might have some Reddit stalkers who downvote anything you post because you educated them on a past post and they’re still bitter, has happened to me multiple times.
---
Where did you find it?
---
I can totally display my collection of mr fuzzy teddy bears, imported chinese teddy bears, teddy fears, and also sacrifice them to the RNGrinder for improved legendaries /s
---
i dont see why the raider bot wasn't put next to the chem bot
---
What was your actual weight? Approx is fine.
---
Very true thankfully I had some other trades go through successfully and got some good items, or I'd probably be more angry then I was, lol
---
I'm not being negative...that's not what my post was about or meant to be
---
They did the same in FO4, they even put up a disclaimer on each bundle saying so. No discounts for already owned items. No partial refunds when they put something on sale the day after you buy it. Ffs, Walmart has a better return policy.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love the game and Bethesda ad a whole, but whoever is in charge of the microtransactions is a greedy shithead.
---
Thx mate that really good to know, looks like first good rifle that can be crafted 😳, no more waiting for lucky legendary drop 😁, as craftable item it will be probably very affordable to buy unlike good legendary items.
---
You are not helping or contributing to the conversation
---
Well, yeah I guess people wouldn't believe they're apart of the same group seeing as they're flying no colours at all. So yeah, it makes sense.. or doesn't? I don't know... Haha.  
---
Short end of the stick, Don't shoot the vendor. No matter how repetitively dialogue challenged they are.
---
Really easy to do so.
---
\- In the heat of combat, open PIP press 'R' to take Radaway - wrong PIP screen, drops item.
---
\- Discarding junk items, massive lag may have you drops items you did not want to.
---
No idea, cant remeber ever seeing a warning but i dont think i ever really favourited non legendary guns
---
It would be so easy. I really wanted the vault red bundles but I already owned half of each. They could have gotten $20 out of me easily.
---
They livestream. They just live-streamed today actually.
---
Never spent a dime on this game. All earned atoms
---
Is it worth it? Who knows. I sure hope so tho because I have 2 mules overencumbered with legendaries 😂
---
It’s not just because of the vendor tho I’m just really bad at letting things go. After playing past Fallout fans a certain way I’m still adjusting to the limits of this one even after 500+ hours. A helpful trick is to mod all your armor to ultra-light to save even more space and never mod them with anything else as this will increase their weight.
---
Love me some free stuff
---
No sir they did not
---
I'm a dataminer and can see her health and buffs and all the scripts associated with her
---
Well I found a Bloodied 50% limb dmg one way back and love using it with Demolition Expert and Grenader, but it’s mostly a novelty weapon I use for fun. Seems to do more damage outside vats If you can actually lob a grenade at their feet. It’s always about 95% to hit in Vats (baring cover) but the damage isn’t spectacular. 
---
It’s fun to scare players with, lobbing grenades at them from a great distance, but in real pvp it’s not super useful.
---
Furious Power Fist with faster swing speed and plus 1 strength...
---
Pop puncture or heated on it and tear a dude apart.
---
Wait there are radstorms!?
---
So then I didn’t watch the developers play the game on twitch? They announced that they’d start live-streaming gameplay with the developers a little before the 2019 roadmap was released. If you check their twitter/ig page, they announced that a livestream was going to take place today.
---
They have never had a live stream
---
I said livestream a state of the game and talk to fans...ie the way they do with the division...read the post man
---
The bonus it gives is perfect for stealthy things and sending super mutants to the green place
---
I've been slowly filling my storage. As I get more legendaries, I get rid of the heavier stuff. Mostly one stars, but two or more stars and weightless are kept regardless, just in case the value of legendary items is not linear.
---
I have a quad hunting rifle so yes legendaries do spawn on it. According to the data both of those can be legendary
---
STAND STILL... CITIZEN
---
Alright
---
I had it work for me... I got two recall chips when I had none so...
---
It works for this one, I just tested it and have two units now and it showed the proc indicator image
---
At this point? I think you're a bit slow. My main is in the 140's, and my alt has hit 60 today. Just straight up gameplay. I don't even hit Whitesprings/Watoga unless I have a good reason. That and cooking everything I can and rebuilding my CAMP regularly, it's amazing how the XP adds up crafting and building.
---
I actually play with a few folks from Germany and the UK. I am from the US. So I believe everyone plays together.
---
I also got shit loot and a crash after...
---
I’ve been seeking the plans for it forever...
---
Disconnected
---
Yes, pretty much every day. I have tried unequipping damage perks, makes no difference.  Same thing with underarmour. The only way to change it seems to be to fast travel or log out and back in.
---
Just to clarify I have bloodied weapons and tse weapons. What will happen is the bloodied weapons will go down in damage and the tse's will go up. Then the opposite will happen. The bloodied weapons seem to fluctuate more. Maybe by 100-200 where as the tse's maybe go up and down by 50.
---
Power armour doesn't seem to fluctuate as much as weapons but to be fair I only use it when I'm encumbered. So it may be for others. 
---
I was convinced for sometime they were making changes on the fly server side daily.. maybe for testing but it does seem to be a bug.
---
Awesome addition.  
---
So damn good, but why wasn't it implemented at launch?
---
&gt;They don't even carry Mods on them, for some arbitrary reason.
---
I think that's intentional. It would be way too easy to shop for mods if they'd carry them too.
---
Your answer is unclear AF.
---
This is permanent buddy.
---
G'day mate, 'nother aussie here.  Xbox 1.. Aha.  
---
The way the servers are setup is by cloud servers. So basically, there isn't set locations: Oceanic and such. It's basically we all play together, and hopefully not *lag* that much.
---
I got thrown into the chaos in Survival, was not at all prepared, so I died a whole bunch, but the worst part was that I lost more and more of my Aid items until I ran out of Stimpaks.  All I could do between deaths was watch the fallen appeal for assistance before they succumbed to their mortal wounds, corpses trampled underfoot in the frenzy, and the bags... so, so many bags...  Some kind soul collected all of mine, just forgot to return them to me, I'm sure they'll remember soon... 8')
---
It uses Amazon cloud servers so you will be playing with ppl who are closest to the same server as you. I believe there is only two locations in Oz, Sydney and Melbourne. Its possible to play with ppl from other countries if they are in your friends list
---
It's not about only scraping, it's about stop to sell, scrap, drop many various and precious items. Simple, can we cover our Power Armor Chassis? You cannot add them into favorite list as you know.
---
...is that a Gatling Plasma in your pants or are you just happy to see me?
---
So there is a way for me to repair that wall with the writing on without having to redo all the text with all the lining up that takes forever!
---
They tend to keep you in your own region, so you should only play with people from the Ozzie region unless you join a friend who's from a different region. 
---
I'm Irish and tend to play with Europeans, I have an Ozzie friend and when ever I join his server I see mostly Australians, same goes for when I join American friends.
---
Hmm, that's a very valid point. But I guess in some senses, they need to keep the Trainstation Vendors valid.. I would assume.
---
You're not sending me to the cooler [https://youtu.be/SRH-Ywpz1\_I](https://youtu.be/SRH-Ywpz1_I)
---
Oversight maybe
---
The sheepsquatch event?
---
Yup! As long as you've finished the questline
---
It's real and it very much so two taps me at level 105 in full x01
---
I predict another 200 stash when player vending hits 5/7.
---
Yes, same for me.  I thought it had been fixed -- I thought it worked correctly after my first logout post-patch but it appears I was mistaken.  This is still an issue.
---
Its a drop from the new event. I think it spawns on the corpse and isnt a reward, im not sure about that part though.
---
Wow pvp in Fallout was such a great idea, and implemented so well... just amazing.
---
I have heard you can buy a run by a vendor in whitesprings for 1900 caps, but i didn't checked it.
---
And now I can no longer access building with Biv E. Ridge.
---
I jump up on the roof and whip out my explosive minigun
---
I’ve stopped joining SBQ it’s expensive for ammo, and I see a lot of folks not helping.
---
It is ok, as most of people used their free card, there will not be more of event which you need to pay 2700caps to start again. To get one legendary item wich can be one star and some cosmetic items, that seems to not be rare.
---
based on the game files there seems to either be a phase 2 event or a rare encounter with an actual sheepsquatch
---
They've released in-game footage from the DLCs trailer of the real sheepsquatch monster, and their has been pre-patch footage of it accidentally spawning in at workshop defenses prowling like a deathclaw. Its in the game files, but its not active yet.
---
Someone needs to activate it.
---
Earlier that someone was me.
---
A bunch of people showed up to help, and refused to activate the pylons. A level 35 dude kept telling everyone to just keep shooting and don't worry about the pylons. I tried to keep all three active myself. We died a lot and failed...then someone picked up my dead loot bag.
---
Deep sigh...
---
Ahh nice
---
Ooo wow yess!! Lol launching a nuke was so much fun but since I lost practically all my ammo and healings I need to grind to get those back lol I’d like help to launch a nuke and also to help better my build. I am on PS4 my ID is MiissThaang 
---
Let me know if that doesn’t work I literally just changed it like and hour ago so I don’t know if people can add me with that user ID
---
Walls next to the stairs are the worst! I've had to take down the whole camp due to walls not being able to be placed next to it after the stairs is placed. Sometimes it has helped to remove any wall above, but other times I've had to remove the entire top floor to be able to remove the stairs and place the wall.
---
I go up on the roof to snipe the Eyebombs and jump down to revive the armoured folks getting involved in melee.
---
I'm honestly surprised anyone can even see bags in that chaos! xD
---
I think Im getting slightly more than usual. But they aren't exactly rare even normally so a bit hard to say for sure.
---
I joined survival and there was event going on, when i fully loaded it writen we failed. There was one guy, so i killed him before he killed me. Is it really so cooperative?
---
Fair suggestion.
---
Lmao hilarious 😂
---
well you can tame one cat
---
Worked just fine. Won't be on for a few more hours though. Got plenty of aid on my main. He's muling all the stuff I picked up in survival on my alt. 
---
Any specific ammo you need?
---
played through the new quest yesterday seems like if there is a low level player the quest reward want be leveled correctly as my fixer and hers is at lvl 30
---
You just got served!
---
######And protected.
---
That's the imposter
---
Real sheepsquatch files are in game but not active yet
---
It looks so fucking awesome.
---
I need it
---
BoS Recon Rifle isn't too bad either.
---
But... I didn't buy it, and you didn't read...
---
Yeah it's a tricky one.  I generally go by the developer and whether the mod is a cheat or not.  So I wouldn't install any of the mods which, e.g., highlights stashes and so on, but this type of mod sounds fine.
---
You right my b
---
I'm interested in watching. What time are fights planned for?
---
Think I came across [your girlfriends house](http://imgur.com/S0SQoEw) in game.
---
Oh my god, so i came home from work, and they put servers back online hour before i am going to sleep? 
---
Conan of exiles it be then!
---
yeah very understanable, next time report his ass if you didnt do it.
---
I farmed all the pieces for sturdy and heavy combat armor from the Harpers Ferry vendor  about two weeks ago. Took about 2 days to finally find the last plan. 
---
Check the (Known) plans when you look. Only one plan for combat armor will spawn at a time. Quite often, you’ll already have it and have to server jump- again.
---
100% thought this was going to be about pay to win kits in the atom store
---
Last time I checked Grafton station sold it and the price is 1-2k, somewhere in between
---
Well for No Man's Sky they really had to. It was their first game, they don't have a track record like Bethesda of having rather broken games that are all fun. Their first game was a mess and if they had not put the effort in to fix it, then noone would ever buy their next game. The reputation of throwing broken crap out and then moving on is deadly for a indie publisher, especially after their very first game. 
---
So for Hello Games in particular i will wait for their next game and see if they pull the same things before i judge.
---
Ok I will check out it too. Thank you mate
---
why isnt this marked as unbreakable/legendary anyways?
---
Definately!
---
Or at least let us equip perk cards to stashes. It's kind of annoying seeing a weapon weigh 3lbs in your inventory, you have 5 space left in your STASH and it says it's "Full" because perks don't affect Stash weight and the weapon actually weighs 20lbs..(displaying actual weight of items in brackets would be nice too, when in your Stash)
---
Nope i had my friend kick me from the team, still said joining team and crashed when starting up
---
folks who are grinding through the game and havent found a legendary for their build yet
---
You can indeed get the plans for it, it has two built in legendary effects centered around sneaking. The reason why you'd want the plan (or to know someone that has it) is because the quest-reward variant caps at 30, where-as the one you can make scales all the way to 50
---
Pvp in this game blows. Hard.
---
oh..well.any legendary is better than a crafted.weapon..if you havent had a legendary weapon drop yet maybe their playing wrong? iv used legendary weapons since i was around lvl 20
---
If your camp isn’t a turret tower behind the clubhouse then I truly feel bad you had to experience that. Fortunately Bethesda has announced that they’re working on a change to Pacifist mode that will also include your camp making it invulnerable unless you’re engaged in PvP or to certain PvE mechanics.
---
No, also those Bastards
---
I like this ***But none of it can be used in PvP***
---
PvP is already in a *'imma cheese with meta weapons'* and doesn't need more problems.
---
I stab people with my meth knife, but it ain't explosive DPS
---
Yess Bethesda please add in all of the other songs from previous fallouts
---
yeah but most legendaries that are under the 40 to 50 range aren't worth using if you get a higher level weapon of that type with the exception of explosive
---
If your luck is maxed and you keep trying the scanner does it eventually work like the pie machines
---
You need to activate it.

I use normal earphones and the mic on my laptop 😁
---
Really?? I had no idea! I’ve see maybe 2 or 3 rad storms in my 250+ hours

'Cause he's trying to curb his addiction.. Ya know? They have to be a little considerate. Lol
---
I watch the Noclip documentaries about once a week. I’m down.
---
Same here, I spent 10 minutes searching for her and couldn't find it, checked every "metal pile" in the area as well. Done the event 4 times and gotten loot twice.  body disappeared for me or something and next time, the game didn't let me respawn after dying, camera just floated around me with the "Press A to Respawn" prompt, though never worked.
---
If you walk into a prison, you’ll be shocked by all the innocent men behind bars. Just ask them, they’ll tell you they didn’t do nuffin
---
I guess it was inevitable, they either always planned for party boy to not work with the new alcohol or felt it was just easier to change a cards descriptive text than fix whatever could have been wrong.
---
Somebody help this kind and polite person please.

For PvE I roll with an Instigating lever action that pretty much one shots anything besides scorchbeasts and deathclaws with a well placed headshot. A bloodied rifle would probable do a little more damage but I’m not really interested in managing all the variables and prefer to be more tanky. If the fighting gets too close I whip out an Anti-Armor handmade and let ‘er rip. 
---
Armor wise I’m using a mixture of unyielding/bolstering sentinel gear.
---
Just got it as an award event. Haven't seen any plans on the corpse so far, just trash legendaries
---
Depends on ur build. If u playing stealth make rifle build, if u just shooting enemy with vats make rifle or automatic weapon, but no power armor. Cuz vats using energy in power armor. I think Bloodied stealth rifle build deals a lot of damage, maybe the biggest damage for now, but u have to set ur build correct
---
Hmmmm pretty sure the only flux that is found on trees is when the glowing resin becomes gloom sap... and that produces cobalt flux...
---
Done this event 4 times, SBQ 2 times and killed over 11 o 12 3\* legendaries enemies. Result = 0 3\* legendaries. Congrats Bethesda :D
---

Same, I was at the part where you had to grab the ingredients in the quest yesterday but had to get off for work, went to finish it just now as I had some free time, and the quest is completely gone
---
I’m Australian and the very few random people I’ve met with voice chat have all been Australian. Ive made a habit of saying g’day with mic on area chat if I’m near someone. 🤙
---
I saw a level 839 about 3 months ago. Obviously using exploits and almost certainly banned by now. 😆
---
The workshops is a game mechanism created to give players a thing to fight over. Making it impossible to take would destroy the mechanisms goal. Then the whole contest-mechanism is faulty and the workshops could be removed completely. They also showed this by trying to make the whole stacking of foundations impossible.  
---
If your home is a game mechanism and that alarm isn't part of the game it would be abuse of the game most likely, yes.
---
If I recall the awards aren't put into your inventory. You should find the Eye of Ra on one of the corpses. Wearing this and the Garb of Mysteries gives you extra DR ER, turns the Blade of Baset into a badass sword that ignores 100% armor and gives the Voice of Set additional electrical damage against robots.
---
Only problem is as soon as you get the right perks, stats, weapons, and armor to compliment what's meta-relevant, Bethesda reworks it. I know this is probably for the best, but still. It feels like we're chasing that magic dragon lol
---
And not only that. In the old version if you managed to make the small workbench area unreachable that workbench would be unusable for the rest of that servers life.
---
Can confirm, the SBQ does not guarantee 3* legendaries, I’ve only fought her maybe 10-15 times in my nearly 300 hours but I’ve only gotten a 3* drop just two of those times. Sounds like OP is just extremely lucky.
---
“Distinct lack of cohesion” you don’t say? I guess all that Psycho has unintended side effects or maybe the “what’s yours is mine” attitude doesn’t lend itself well to group dynamics. Nice sub tho... Responder out.
---
Don't even need to finish the Questline, just the event.
---
I'm still on the Garrahan Estate part, saw the event pop, and got my plan that way.
---
Same! What time?
---
My quad harpoon gun works disagree. Quad dual barrel users would also be unhappy. 
---
I also think it would be a better 3rd star. 25% less durability loss per shot or something...
---
Cranberries so I can make cobbler without having to travel would make me so happy
---
You need to have finished the second part of the main questline or it won't drop.
---
I've seen maybe three.
---
I was blown away but how freaking lazy (as you say) they were about it. They drop six robots that say Protect and Serve in random shops. Boom done. 
---
I’d really love to walk thru this team’s office and see what they do all day and how they brainstormed that amazing addition.
---
The poster was sadly atom shop and the bar is actually quite easy to make you just gotta line things up I managed to do it with the Xbox controller in about 5mins,
---
I use something called dresser it's under tables variant 1 
---
The edge over hangs a little so you can clip the overhang to make it one large surface while pushing the sides as close together as possible, I use 2 to make it thick and hide the dresser draws on the one side but yes you can really make any shape using them because of the clipping of the overhang :) hope this helps if not I'll make a quick 30 sec video
---
Apparently it's going to be atom shop do I guess they finally will make me crack and buy something
---
I wish I could. But only Bethesda or trusted person abroad can help them. And since there is no way to gift them, we cannot help as a community ...
---
I think that the having the owner returning to the workshop to defend it as a condition for putting them in PVP would be great. If the owner don't return the workshop transferes without PVP. Once the owner has returned, PvP is enabled and fight for the workshop carries on as usual. This means that once you've retuned, you're in. No stepping in and out.
---
Yeah i saw a lot of people talking about when you could make impenetrable foundation bases and how they used those to cheese the workshops.
---
I feel like she is still way too buggy.. I did one last weekend with about 8 lvl 100+ players, and we barely got her to the point where she regenerates. I did one yesterday, immediately after the new sheepsquatch event, with about the same amount and same level people, and we killed her with 10 minutes left.. It's way too random if she'll stay close enough to shoot, how many times she'll land, etc. It's a crap shoot sometimes, and 75% of the time the loot isn't worth it.
---
I think 1000 weight limit would be plenty. If you need more space than that then you’re just hoarding too much lol. I’d rather put server stability first.
---
Sure, I know it’s annoying having to get rid of things you don’t want to get rid of, but that’s just how the game works and it’s really not necessary to hoard that much stuff. I struggle with the limit myself but I’m just happy it’s slowly been increased thus far.
---
To be honest, in time when TSE weapons were super OP, I tried to get one. But price was too high. So then I decided to make my own build, that I will enjoy playing, and made my “almost one shot revolver build” and u know it’s cool! It’s interesting ! I didn’t seen anyone playing this! And tse got nerfed some time after, so just play ur preferable build. Make ur ideal character and do that. I had Django Unchained ;)
---
If there's a cost and the try fails if the agressor stepps out I don't think there's any need to limit the tries. Go ahead, pay up. Perhaps even half the caps of a failed try could go to the owner.
---
mine does not take the mats, it just makes the sound that it crafted and applied the mod, then nothing...it didnt actually do anything.
---
There should be like a size limit for tamed animals.
---
1 sloth or deathclaw (XL)
---
Or
---
2 brahmin (L)
---
3 dogs, wolves, etc (M)
---
4 cats, bunnies, squirrels, etc (S)
---
That'd be a really cool addition. With some added features on this, we could start roll playing veterinarians and whatnot.
---
Also, we should be able to roll play tattoo artists and piercers. That'd be badass.
---

---
So PSN players can get the name they actually desire to be displayed in game? Well, hope they can make this change to Fallout 76 on PC eventually. That or at least allow us to have our Character name displayed in the game while our Account Name is displayed when viewed in the map list.
---
The plus one strength adds next to no extra damage
---
Yes that's what I mean. For example, "Lever action rifle" in french is "Fusils à levier", there's an accent right in the vanilla name. If I try to rename it with "z Fusils à levier" or even the same "Fusils à levier" well, I can't. 
---
It's more a GoL thing I know but it's still a bug.
---
I have over 40 of those bad boys sitting in my inventory. I haven’t used one in probably over 200 hours of gameplay but for some reason I always pick them up still when I happen upon them haha
---
Great question! I think that is compeletely fair!
---
Technically if you really wanted to yes. But you would have to name your account after the character you play as in Fallout 76.
---
The change just allows ps players to change their PlayStation username. Which hasn't been able to happen until yesterday.
---
You should add the responder flair to yourself
---
If mods ever do come I really hope Shoodycast can bring the "Wasteland Codex" into The world.  It was always nice having the Storyteller waxing in The background, not to mention the insane amount of lore you could learn by reading the codex entries.
---
Very much this. They are PvPers who don't want to do PvP on equal terms as then they otherwise could play survival instead.
---
Right but they have that capability now, that's good. I hope they would allow that or the character name change. If I actually put time into coming up with my character name I'd want it displayed when someone meets or sees me rather than my account name.
---
Shocked and dismayed
---
Not sure, if I got ur question right, but the poster is in the wall decoration tab in camp after you purchased it for free in the atom store
---
I guess :/
---
[I managed to get a proper screenshot of it](https://i.imgur.com/PxT18HV.jpg). No idea.
---
Totally. If you actually think about it. The fact that you choose your character name in the beginning and then it is never used in in game content again afterwords is really really strange.
---
There isn't. :/
---
Luckyly there is also a flipside on this,yesterday i wanted to buy a tse shotty from someone but the gun was on his mule and full off caps,so he said give me 5k on this one then i log out and come back on the mule and give you your gun,i thought f*ck it its only game money and give him the caps,sure enough couple minutes later he comes back with the gun and gave it to me,he could have just taken the 5k and run:)
---
Should just have the ability to lock things like in Borderlands or Destiny, I can't tell you haw many times I've nearly scrapped a full set of power armor.
---
Ah, I remember: it is a variation of the Nukashine Poster.
---
I don't think they could. This is totally exploitable system in MMO world. There is no way you can distinguish a really good or really bad player.
---
Yeah man I've made hundreds of easy going trades so I've never expected such a response honestly. Happy to hear your trade went well though Ive never had a trade go like that. May Mothman bring you many happy sightings in the wasteland brotha!
---
Here's a great stat, and feel free to tell me I'm playing the game wrong.
---
600 hours.
---
4 current characters(108, 58, 16, 10)
---
I've gotten a few others into the 20's before deleting.
---
Turns out, it's so difficult to get 3 star legendary items without buying them from other players, I've only begun getting decent drops at that 3 digit character.
---
Even now, I go somewhere, let's say Whitesprings because yesterday was the first time I spawned into the game on a server where there was a nuking there while my C.A.M.P. was in the blast zone. I must have killed 5 legendary ghouls, at least two 3-stars, and all I was getting were single star armor pieces. I've killed a decent number of the Legendary Deathclaws, and usually the experience in killing them is more worth it than the loot, for example, almost every time I'm around Hopewell Cave, there's a Scorchbeast, so it's cool to fight off three types of enemy at once, as you don't even see the Deathclaw unburrow half the time because your eyes are on the sky. 
---
The Hopewell cave situation does bring me to beg Bethesda to consider making all or at least any Lv65+ Scorchbeasts a Legendary Enemy, instead of a re-fillable health bar, they land only once or twice? I dunno, it's just weird to kill 15 Scorched, a Deathclaw and a Scorchbeast and all I got was this picture at the Cemetary on top of the cave - and 30 atoms I guess, but this week I noticed their daily challenges have finally gotten to a 'only people who play 8 hours a day will be able to accomplish some of these- point, but I'm just complaining at thiiis point.
---
I can't find it neither
---
Pretty much, for a multiplayer game like this I really don't know why Bethesda wouldn't have that set in. It really would have been better in an RP sense to display our character names. If people were worried about griefers/harrassment then that's where either having the character name followed by the account name in brackets on the map screen player list would help.
---
Some ones gotta organise these jet heads.
---
I don't think you did, as my pole hook is level 30 and pole hooks go from level 10-50, not 5-45. Therefore you couldn't have possibly gotten a lvl 5 pole hook
---
Or something to the effect of if you request one as a friend, it reveals the actual username when the person accepts. I almost feel like it was supposed to be this way initially but they ran into an unforeseen complication so they had to cut it.
---
Additionally you can skip this section all together with Lvl 3 lock pick and Lvl 3 hacker perks
---
That would be awesome if it was possible.  One of the guys I play with take turn stomping each others camps because we are just a bit to close together (it's how we met lol) and we're too stubborn to relocate.  Would be be amazing if we could be fudge out boundaries and be proper neighbors.
---
I keep saying to myself, they don't weigh anything and one day I might want to use one ...
---
Or it could repair damages but not desteoyed items fully eveey time you relog maybe?
---
Also, let teams switch servers as a whole to a server where the whole team fits.
---
Was considering getting it, first thing i see when i checked the subreddit, probably not gonna get it now
---
Then I don't know. That's where I found mine.
---
Well, if they're able to work with PSN so players can change their name on there then it stands to reason that a change like that could at least be done for PC players. Even a couple checkboxes for "Display Character Name"/"Display Account Name" would make things better for those who want their character name or those that wish to keep their Account name displayed.
---
This is a stupid idea . It’s just turn into everyone running melee . If someone never stops moving than vats is useless . I’d be fine with them implementing maybe a -25% vats chance on a moving target and LoS dropping vats
---
I think at the point when they deleted all the mass duplicated guns and armour on everyones accounts they shouldve flagged any account that had 2 or more of a particular legendary item and wiped the account, this would sureley have been a fair way to do it.
---
Hopefully it will be implemented at the same time or before player vending since active vending machines are said to mark camps on the map.
---
That's not hot, that's a fucking city destroying conflagration. Holy moly is that sexy.
---
What do you guys not complain about ?
---
It should be in your inventory or stash.
---
I feel like the game itself should include this. For all platforms. Maybe in a future update? It makes it really hard to role play when everyone calls you by the name you had made 25 years ago before you even played fallout haha
---
They need to cut it back down to 400.
---
Learn some inventory management.
---
Well either your set magically got in my inventory or the automatic dupe is back because my set clones itself
---
I'm hoping player vendors will allow us to sell our excess scrap or items so those that need it can buy what they need while allowing us to free up space in our Stash.
---
The whole armor?
---
&gt; We're in a massive callout culture right now where everyone is digging up dirt on everyone else.
---
Except we're not.  The majority of people don't do this, and the majority of people don't have this done to them.
---
&gt; You can pick literally anyone and they will have something fucked up in their past or beliefs, it's just that some are better at hiding it than others.
---
No, you really can't--depending on what you mean by fucked up.  I mean sure, people make mistakes or say something bad off the cuff, but that's a different thing to publicising morality like Oxhorn has done.  Once you do that, then what you publish can be held up for criticism.  This is especially true of people with public personas like YouTubers, politicians, celebrities and the like.
---
I'm sure you're right, we all probably have at least one fucked up belief.  But when we put that belief out into the public, well...  it's public.  People are going to read it and have opinions about it, and judge you as a person for it.
---
&gt; This strive for "pure wholesomeness uwu" is far more toxic to our culture than some youtuber not liking gays.
---
It's not about not liking gay people, it's about writing an article on not liking gay people.  Besides, the creepy thing he did secretly filming that woman to fat-shame her took it to a whole other level.
---
Will most likely be a reskin not a new item.
---
Ahh interesting.  I didn't realize there were conditions and was surprised that it had completed when it didn't feel like I had gotten three levels already.  This explains a lot lol
---
So I had this problem too. I decided I'd head back to my CAMP to try adding the new Calibrated Shocks I just brought again because maybe I just needed the reload. Had some ghouls and after I killed them I got kicked off the server. Get back on and my mod is completely gone. All the items put in my stash before I traveled were still on me but my mod I attempted to attach was just gone. What a waste of caps.
---
Oh yeah, I agree.  But it is indicative that he'd take action on his less wholesome beliefs, which is disturbing.
---
Abso-f*cking-lutely!
---
You could basically just recycle all of Arnold's lines and they'd all work
---
I activate all 3 solo because I have the first aid perk and i don't mind wasting 3-5 stims a cycle if it means we get the fight done.  I always sacrifice for the greater good in gaming , nothing worst than someone afraid to die for their team.
---
Like you figured out there should be a option to rename some items (not stackable ones) when you first press X to view the item and then V to rename. If you are missing option i would suggest something that fixes 99% of the problems after patches. Remove all mods and custom ini's.
---
Not if it's just a Enclave Under armor retexture, you can quite literally get one just by doing the main quest. Or Vault suit retexture, which I may remind you everyone gets at the start of the game. Or Raider Under armor, you get for doing Rose's quest.
---
Heh.  I get what you're saying, but context is important.  And the whole covert filming thing.  Gross.
---
Should have said “Your power armor has been returned to your inventory.”  It will be a normal power armor frame in your inventory.
---
It's a new item, you can't have different skins on underarmors.
---
Thanks I will take look when I play
---
So sick of getting the waiting to join world is full message
---
I did the opposite. All my equipped stuff starts with “Ze” so it’s at the bottom of the list
---
It's not hard to get the underarmor, but the plans to upgrade them.  
---
Bos, raider, casual, enclave underarmors have their own plans.  
---
If this one it's considered a normal Enclave underarmor there's no problem, but we'll have to wait.
---
Anyone else notice that when a diseased scorchedbeast (the ones that spray the green gas) flys over a building that you are inside the gas sprays inside the building like the roof didn’t exist causing you to take damage. Haven’t checked if this is still the case since the most recent update but it has happened several times to me.
---
It took me 30 fucking minutes to do the whole dlc i call that shit
---
I would bet white springs will have it now.
---
&gt;Hopefully someone will revive you periodically
---
Except they Don't, no ones gives a shit about anyone but themselves during the event from what i've seen...
---
Ok, thank you anyway mate
---
&gt;pray for ATOM to be available early.
---
Not sure the pun was intended but it was a good one. ;-)
---
I also live and play in Japan and unfortunately, we just have to ガマン. 
---
This is why now I'm always hesitating to buy things from the shop fearing something better will be released the next day and I won't have enough atoms. But if Bethesda release non-cosmetic items on the ATOM store, sure players from Japan, we will be handicapped.
---
Well people like you come here daily to complain about shotguns being op so maybe it’s just you ? Maybe just admit you suck and stop trying to nerf things you don’t even understand
---
Et cetra
---
Once Brexit happens is U.K. players will only be able to play with other U.K. players on our own dedicated U.K. server. It’s a law. Look it up.
---
That's a bit naff
---
Yea its called power armour chassis unless you rename it they will all be called that. Whatever type it was (xo1 or whatever) will still be equipped to the chassis.
---
Thanks man!
---
If you drop a grenade and stand on it , does it hurt you?
---
Being in Sweden I've mostly met other people from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden as well as some Germans, Brits and a few people from what I guess would be Poland and Russia.
---
You're right that's terrible. I remember the first month of the game,wherever i went,everything was open,looted or used.
---
Yesterday i had to enter the secret room in the taxidermy and spoiled its existance to a guy that was down there.
---
This. This right here.
---
But during a hectic event where everyone's dying every minute or so? No, don't take those.
---
Well then you probably rushed through it and have even less of an idea of what is going on. No way you did all that and all the side quests.
---
When is this due?
---
Hey that worked! Thanks. Do you know if you can legendary animals? Is there any benefit from doing so?
---
I've tried WS on 8 servers and didn't find it.
---
Yea all the side  quests and the main portion of the dlc also the ends shit as well
---
Roleplaying, Socializing. Helping other People if needed. Killing other People if wanted. Make fun of other people of they try todo the same with me. etc
---
I’m here to talk about what it means. Not argue if you felt like you got enough out of it.
---
 Well that is unfortunate, if whitesprings doesn’t have it then I have no idea who would.
---
Again, the event only lasts a few minutes. If you want to get there in time, there's a chance you don't have the time to go drop off your loot.
---
\*Laughs hystrerically\* Ahahahahaha..... You can't be serious?
---
Raiders for LIFE
---
But I've seen it at Whitespring! I just can't find it again..
---
I don't always fight the SBQ, but when I do, I get disconnected from the server...
---
I have very little charisma perks but I always try and revive if I see someone down. 
---
Stealing the junk is just an asshole thing to do, what about like a locked nuka cola lunchbox that drops instead when killed by a mob that would allow you a chance to retrieve your stuff? If lockpicked the person is then wanted. After a while it breaks down and can be looted. If you intentionally drop stuff, keep this as the paper bag so we can differentiate
---
Oh yeah it's worth it, scrapping your favorite weapon is a way bigger chore :)
---
Head to the roof of West-tec and search....there is one up there!
---
Thanks man, I will take a look when I play again.
---
not for atoms no but for caps I'd do it all day
---
If you ask me it does not add very much in the way of lore maybe a little but does not add to tje bigger picture
---
There is a bug at least on PS4 where if the new “News Feed” page fails to load. The game will blue screen crash when you try to sign in. It can happen more than once, and the only way to fix it is to close the game and reopen it.
---
I shudder to think of the times we'd turn in those lovely engrams just to get trash from them. Rahool's reputation will *never* recover from that.
---
Fallout 76's Legendaries still has some time to save themselves where Rahool failed.
---
Yeah I know, and also charisma increasing alcohols and untielding armour guved boost to charisma I know I know
---
That's...not really a source.
---
one of my friends once gave one to me after he got his 3rd or 4th pie in a silo and it’s still sitting in my stash feeling so undeserved, i’ve never got a pie myself during the 700 hours i’ve played even though i try every single machine i see ;-;
---
Gamers; “we need more endgame!”
---
Also gamers: “make the endgame shorter and easier!”
---
I LOADED 16 TONS OF NUMBER 9 COAL!!!
---
i lost a ton off stable flux(all types) to the same problem, I was in the middle of selling them, game crash and there goes my flux.
---
Oh.. You are serious.. *\*backs away slowly down-voting\**
---
Pie in the sky? Haha.  I really want one from a Port-A-Diner, for that extra feeling. I will eventually just keep attempting at one until it dispenses but atm I just try once or twice hoping for that extra lucky feeling. Nice to know there's a guaranteed piece out there. I'd have preferred not to know that though hehe I'll pretend I don't!
---
I've been dropping everything in my stash before heading to the event. Can't feed the trolls if there's no food in your to-go bag. Also, on a side note, dropping born survivor perk and just dying/respawning instead of wasting a ton of stimpaks seems to work well.
---
I am now usually roaming the survival servers in a team of four, dominating the leaderboards. Yesterday I met a team of three Russian (suka blyat dawaj dawaj) leaders with about 20 kills as a team of three. I put down all three in one life.
---
None of the armor pieces I wear nor the weapons I favour were prelevant during the duping times. It was mostly about TSEs and Assassin Sentinels. I on the other hand wear three different prefixes, zero sentinels, have not a single two shot gun in my inventory, and prefer non-explosive weapons from explosive ones for most situations. 
---
Duping crisis is already solved. The meta evolved beyond. The people killing you researched the game for hundreds of hours and now often use neglected armor they have purchased for lowly amounts of caps. I scored a perfect piece for 4k yesterday. I browse prople inventories and I ignore "trade only" sections mostly, and I still get godrolls because people think that if its not assassin sentinel its worthless. The only remainder of duping crisis is that people still overpay for gear thats only useful in world of slap damage. The gear itself is 3rd tier now.
---
Phoenix has it, might take a few server hops but he has it
---
quest were working fine for me, the problem I got is I cant repair my gear, it acts like it does it evens makes the sounds, but nothing changes on the gear and the status bas doesnt change either.
---
Interested in the myself, I did Best Intentions and got mk nothing.
---
Aha... Stop!! 
---

---
No other legendaries that require specific counters? All explosove weapons?
---
Haha I know how you feel. I just want to see that damn Port-A-Diner claw catch!
---
Well you won't have long to wait.  And it looks pretty good so far.
---
https://store.steampowered.com/app/990630/The_Last_Campfire/
---
Phoenix?? Okay, thanks a lot!
---
It's an issue since patch 8 dropped, hopefully the Maintenance today will fix it.
---
Oh, ok thank you. Hopefully the maintenance does fix it.
---
Yeah, that one was weird. I got a random legendary armor piece. My teammate did too. I personally think they'll be adding in more side quests like those to get the other plans, but who knows..
---
I meant more along the lines of armor but I guess I should have stated that. Honestly that’s not really the best example to use since Bethesda nerfed that already and the counters are more passive, a dense mod and fireproof perk.
---
No worries when i first stared out i thought it just spawned out if left then found i had 4 of them  and no space left.
---
i just want to see how long does the event has before I fast travel to it, too many times I had fast travel for the event to be finished in a few minutes and me not been able to finish it.
---
I have a Vampire Cultist Dagger I renamed to as "The First Blade," a weapon wielded by Cain (then Dean later on) from Supernatural
---
My sniper is the clit tickler..
---
I hope they do, looking forward to a full trophy wall! 
---
And you're lucky I got 2 chems for my troubles.
---
Have you been able to find where you craft the picnic basket? I went looking through all my camp items with no luck.
---
This is awesome, never though to do this. I have my new Fallout playlist rocking now.
---
You can get just one rank in each for a 30% damage bonus for only three points.
---
It's kind of hard not to, especially for the players that don't nuke etc. Because the event has a mechanice that is explained on the terminal to initiate the quest. However everyone can just willy nilly join the fight if it activated. I saw a notification about some cryptid and traveled there. Had not finished the new quest line yet but was able to join one of the endfights for it... What amazes me also is this is possible for an event that is located in the lower part of the ash heap. A zone for early midgame players or even lower.
---
Depends on how many points you have, it’s better to have 1 point in each of the three than 3 points in 1. It’s better to have 3 points in all three, than no points in none. ;)
---
This caught me out too. You'll have to use some perks to get rifleman et all to turn up. Personally pick up lone wanderer (all levels) then anything that makes you stealthy and all levels of rifleman (obv)
---
If you have higher luck, there's a better chance of you getting it. Other than that, pray to rng
---
They definitely did something right with several smaller quests as opposed to one big, long, boring one haha.
---
Bloodied Gatling Gun -&gt; Oh Lawd He Comin'
---
My TSE 10mm Automatic Pistol is called Good Intentions. 
---
Haven't really got anything else worth giving a name to.
---
Haha ty, that part I know, but I'm praying to rng yes. I just want to walk up and get one on the first go. Feel so damn good! Like my dream did, before I awoke.
---
The train station is located close to the event zone. Porting there before participating and quickly just stashing junk shouldn't be an issue.
---
If you got a turret base behind the golf club, that's what you. If you haven't, I'm sorry for you but that's how it is with easy to spot bases in an area of high level players...
---
can i ask why not?
---
I use t51 PA and my endurance is only at 3 so i can use adamantium skeleton. Even as a conduit I didnt have too much trouble with tanking damage. TBF I am melee so i could block her attacks.
---
Oh well.   Time to grind the event then
---
Here, this has a 'what to take on each level' guide. Personally it uses basher, not my fave, slightly edit to fit your style.
---

---
You forgot Marine underarmour.
---
I found if I die while standing in the water it’s deep enough to hide my loot bag. I collect it at the end of the event because I’ve got a marker on it so I can see where it is. Otherwise it’s invisible. And things are such a mess close to the middle just give up quickly and return to the fight and no one can track your bag.
---
just a note this is talking about adding the durability modification to quad and double effects
---
Here is my experience
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/af9qav/_/
---
Named my bloodied power fist “ONE and a half PUNCH” not super creative or anything, it’s a work in progress.
---
😂😂😂
---
I know what you mean, I dreamt about having a forest camp jumpsuit and a leather coat, I woke up then realized I play way too much fo76 lol.
---
Thanks for the info on the time screwing up. I have 3 of the recall cards at the moment and I'm gonna try to post on here to get a good group together before I actually initialize the event later on today on xbox
---
you can change the perks in a fly,
---
i have multiple of them depending on what I want to do. i have maxed and 1 points cards of the same. its all on what you want to do/ situation you are in. 
---
you also need to figure out what do you want, max damage or QoL perks, either way sacrifices will have to be made. can have it both ways my friend.
---
Are there random single cats wandering the map? I have been unable to find one that isn't a fixed spawn or in a group. Since those are the requirements for taming.
---
Everything but with a . in front so it puts them to the top of the list
---
Was there at level 16 a while back. Noped out very quickly. 😁
---
Yep. Finally a reason to purchase atoms!
---
My choice of names for my boomsticks are Groucho, Harpo and Chico. Same as my WoW pets on armory screen (frogs).
---
I'm glad I hoarded up to 4000 atoms and didn't buy other discounted skins, they definitely weren't worth buying compared to this skin
---
Ha, I thought it was just me!! 😅
---
yes i can tell you exactly where i tamed it just north up the road from generals steakhouse on the left side of the road is a broken in half mobile home (trailer) out in front of it is a random spawn that is where i tamed my cat , of course there may be other spawns for it as well
---
I stand toe to toe with her on my 3 END build in Ultracite PA. The only 3 END perks are Fireproof.
---
I eat rad scorpion steak before the battle and pop a psychobuff as needed. I do have a 2 shot Gatling gun with +50 limb damage and staggering perks so I'm not sure if the limb or staggering helps with damage reduction on the ISS as I do not see staggering animation. I only have speed demon and marsupial mutations.
---
2 failed events and 2 completed. 2* star and 3* drops so far and a 3* from a gutsy. 2 hats. 
---
I take damage but mostly don't die.
---
I wouldn't mind 1000 but it really shouldn't be any higher than that
---
*it be like that sometimes* 😂😂
---
Thankfully no Radtoads have tried to lick me in a dream (yet?)
---
Better Inventory is another one I would definitely recommend :)
---
No thats false devs want this game to be a survival game, its all the players that can’t handle something bad happening in a video game because they have the less tolerance to pain than a 2 year old - which causes these changes like posts like this. Slap damage was implemented  because the players where terrified of griefers. The devs created survival mode despite the fact the majority of players reacted negatively to it.
---
This game doesn’t even have a real griefing problem. I started a bounty hunting service with friends but we basically gave up on that because the amount of people that “grief” is less than 1% of the player base most of the player base wouldn’t kill people even if there was no slap damage. 
---
How is destroying someones camp not legitimate gameplay? Its in the game?  Its a method of playing the game therefore its  legitimate.  Ironically what you have said exposes you as a hypocrite you say legitimate gameplay allows you to do what you want if i want to destroy somones camp thats legitimate gameplay what isn’t legitimate by your definition is preventing me from attacking your camp/killing people.  No one is forcing you to defend your camp if i attack it, not only that no one is forcing you to repair it you can just log off or even move the camp. Problem solved. You are not forced into pvp. PvP has always been about consent even if I was allowed to kill you with slap damage there was no issue it was super easy to run away or fast travel.No this is using your freewill to remove the free will of others to play a video game how they want. 
---
No the problem is all the players who complain about pvp because the problem isnt its not consensual the problem is that they lost - so therefore its not fair. People complain about survival because they lost all their caps, i took some loses and some  wins but it seems the majority of the player base are crybabies.Survival mode is an excellent example of this by entering you consent to pvp by default, but people complain to me for killing them abuse me over chat which i dont care about but i do care when they cry to bethesda to rework the entire game because they have no self accountability. Now survival gives 25% caps its the exact same as adventure kill people at workshops: “oh you are a griefer and an asshole” then they cry to bethesda and play the victim. In the rare case that People attack their camp then they return fire only to die, then they cry to bethesda: griefers are mean. Very easy to log off and ignore the griefers but they fight back instead. Nothing to do with consent just people cant handle losing.
---
Did you guys try and remove all mods and custom ini's? That is usually the culprit on most cases after patches. Because i personally don't have any mods or ini's and i have no problem modding my PA's.
---
Have you claimed it in the Atom store?
---
I had that happen to me yesterday, i had tod hurry to the event so i had a decent amount of junk on me and i got downed. A guy came up to me and just stood there waiting for me to die. He took my junk. But karma had something in store for him, moments later he was killed without being able to revive him and i was fast and reclaimed my junk plus a fair amount of "compensation". In the wasteland there are many assholes, good thing karma keeps an eye on them.
---
I called my 3* crossbow hearts thorn.
---
dude, i like you put time into this, but WTH did you smoked. for me it is far easier to lunch a nuke than to collect 5k caps, not to mention it take less than 20 minutes to lunch a nuke( if you know what you are doing).
---
I totally agree especially with marsupial 🤬
---
I gather that's an Inventory manager, but how does it improve the UI? :)
---
Now if they’d only stop scrapping of bulk items when you press “scrap all junk” that’d make life a little less stressful! The number of times I’ve scrapped a whole batch of bulb items.....
---
That is incredibly disturbing to tell you the truth!
---
Thanks will have to check it out if I decide to go back to 76. Never got a pet cat sadly haha
---
Trust me, I’ve been through the location and there’s nothing special to be found. It’s like fasnacht, where you’ll find a ton of little Knick-knacks, but the glory is going through the story. I honestly loved the quest lines and the additions to lore.
---
Awsome maybe that why they voted brexit.
---
Don't want to be the alarmist, but lots of hops to the same few servers makes resource collection very challenging.
---
I forgot about the Cryolator, I always have a few legendary ones in one of my stashes. Hmm Furious, AA, or 2 shot?
---
I'm going to try the Endangerol  syringer as well.
---
You used to be able to stack them off of cliffs to make invisible walkways and could place items on top of it to make them appear like they’re floating. Can’t anymore. You clip right through already existing confetti piles now and can’t place items on them anymore. Kind of a bummer. But now I think I’m the sole owner of the only magic carpet in Appalachia!
---
IDK man the pylons can zap you quick. A low level may die fast.
---
This right here is why this playerbase s#cks and pulling game down.  I mean c'mon, you have 3 pylons, obviously there might be something you have to do with them. And not only that, you have have written out "activate pylon 1,2,3" hint list. Wtf, how dumb has to one be not understand what needs to be done?
---
Now Beth be like:"Ohh the playerbase had hard time to figure out how to do this event", meanwhile this event was basically tutorial level difficulty, when it came to figuring out what to do. Now Beth keep pumping out content even, that is made for even more dumb players.
---
Have only renamed my Power Armor
---
 PA X, PA CAV, PA 60 so on :P
---
You must need lots of wood or steel
---
&gt; The proportion of players who run silos versus those who show up at Fissure Site Prime is already poor 
---
its poor due to TSE nerf,current SBQ is super spongy and requirs stupid amounts of ammo to be nerfed not to mention spare weapons due to them breaking
---
Been noticing the same thing. I think they have made it so that the servers you are put in are the ones with the lowest latency for you. I'm also getting 2-3 servers when trying to hop servers.
---
Any Non-Automatic Pistol - Hogan's Alley
---
Rifle - Duck Hunt
---
Shotgun - Contra
---
.50 cal - Metal Slug X
---
M79 - Pneumatic Surprise
---
Cryolator - Mr. Freeze
---
Flamer - Firebat
---
Why are you assuming that this will be a different category of under armor and that you’ll be given plans to upgrade them? Seems like a hate post trying to cash in on the pay2win hysteria atm. Maybe just wait and see and then you won’t have to look like an ass for assuming things that aren’t true.
---
apparently there’s a new cooldown on all containers and static spawns, it’s pretty inconsistent sometimes but you have to wait for like a day or something before the items will respawn
---
Thank you.
---
If you go to sugar Grove where all the computers are there's a few holotopes with dialogue suggesting the government are hunting them.
---
Do you have to complete the mission to have this event pop up for you? Server hopped a few times and never got it to pop up
---
I’m on the same page as you, I wasn’t sure if I was missing something.
---
I just got a picnic blanket to. I'm gonna set up a lovely little camp with 10 simple picnic blankets for everyone
---
A few days ago i got killed while i was down by a level 28, alt f4'd so he didnt get my shit. Then i got downed during Encryptid event and had my loot stolen BUT i did get revived a few times also.
---
So you’re the bastard that takes other people’s stuff ! Real classy considering you need all those people to even complete the event and then you rob then.
---
Makes more sense than any other reason.
---
&gt;The only reason people want guaranteed 3* drops is so they can min/max to whatever their build requires with as little effort as possible.
---
lmao are you for real ,people wanting some non slot machine progression means that somehow people want the easy way jesus christ get a grip
---
if you got any wall deco before from the atom shop( moothman, fascht event poster) it in the same spot just have to move left or right. at least thats were I found mines.
---
Yeah,that's always "just a little more" before you get used to manage your stash effectively. Before this virtually ANY amount would not be enough. I have 3 chars with around 100-200 free stash space on each. There are some really useful guidelines for what (and how much of it) to keep which I follow and I almost never go over 700. When the limit was 400/600, the same technique effectively kept me below 350/500.
---
&gt; If the game made it too easy to get your optimal gear, we would all be done with it by now. Developers want you to keep grinding for better gear
---
and you can make the grind fun,dungeons raids etc none of this pure slot machine garbage :hope to find 3 star legendary kill (first rng proc)3 star legendary hope he drops the weapon you want (second rng proc) make it so that it has an useful primary attribute (third rng proc) its just stupid slot machine design and why world of warcraft is failing right now,people want meaningful progression not slots
---
Same as me. Instigating Lever Action is a one shotting headshot beast for non-queen fights. For your basic running around PvE and all PvP (i'm sneak/vats/sniper) that is. For Queen i switch to my TSE Handmade.
---
Sorry. You'll get a non legendary drill instead of a legendary weapon. It's basically as good.
---
Most definitely. I also enjoy 'sniping' with shotguns.
---
I saw a guy hold 2 pylons last night. It has to be energy damage, at least logic would say so but it is a video game.
---
So Rad Scorpion steak would help. Grounded? I know there are other consumables that help with energy but I'm a meat guy. 
---
Oh man, there's ton of stuff to lower energy resistance and we all know and love the ISS laser blast:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_consumables
---
what?
---
I hope this doesn't come off as hostile but i wish that how you just now put it was more common within this "civil-war". A non-toxic way. 
---
I'm not going to try sway you, you have your opinion and i have mine about the game. The non-constructive circle-jerks (This applies to both "sides") on the other hand is getting.. yeah.. out of hand in my opinion and there's far more of that with the haters. 
---
It's infective but don't get me wrong, 
---
i believe of course that we should high-light issues about the game, the way we push em to the surface could be better and i feel it will be better one day as well as the game.
---
Man going from single-player game to an online one is not easy.
---
It'd be great if they could just split out every action and allowed us to bind them all.
---
I do that after taking activating 2-3 pylons.  Since most of the time everyone cant seem to read what’s on their screens. ACTIVATE THE DAMN PYLONS!
---
You’re relatively safe up there, and the boss gets confused trying to get to you.
---
Are you that desperate for junk? The stuff is everywhere fcs!
---
And you can add names now
---
Really?  Wow.  I finally managed to buy something limited edition.
---
If anyone can find me a (legitimate) way that I can buy atoms for this fella, I will do it.
---
There's a card for cheaper construction of CAMP items. Doesn't that affect repairs too? Otherwise it could end up being cheaper to scrap an item and build it new than repairing it.
---
I run stealth with a bloodied combat knife, no on ever sees it coming 😊
---
&gt;Whereas with better legendary drops, people will be max-geared faster and might get bored with the game. So this route will keep people playing and gambling.
---
they will only stop playing if your game is garbage,make multiple builds viable ,give people ways to acquire gear without playing a slot machine and people will play your game,by your logic by the time i geared my demon hunter in wow to 962 i would have stopped playing no? wrong i kept playing i geared my alt to 962 and i had fun doing it because gearing my character was fun and because there were different classes i wanted to experience in the fun raid that was antorus the burning throne
---
It had a beam splitter before the patch, and pretty much no changes were made to the weapon itself.. It's a legendary Explosive Laser Rifle, so may be something changed in regards to the "explosive" prefix... Not sure. Will need to test again tonight.
---
Thank you in any case.
---
Well, yes - but maybe you could consider yourself a "Covert CQC Specialist" which sounds even cooler than sniper :)
---
I’ve never called for anything to be nerfed simply have some better balancing maybe destiny styled balancing with PvP and PvE having different balancing out of a lot of the Explosive weapons Shotguns are probably more balanced due to the extreme damage falloff what is dumb as a weapon with a stupid high rate of fire example the explosive Laser Rifle with a Beam Splitter Barrel Fallout has nothing to do with skill it’s not a competitive game whatsoever it’s mostly about level and gear
---
This.
---
Mine is a semi, I never liked automatic, so it's not the case here.. However I suspect there might be some relation to the "explosive" prefix that I have on it. I'll have to continue testing tonight. Thank you.
---
I think the places have a cooldown for you looting them too.
---
I go to a that office near the Abandoned Bog Town to collect typewriters and fans and if I clear it out one day, the looted items take a day or so to reappear again... or so it seems for me anyway :)
---
&gt;It makes it feel that much better when u do get one you actually like and need. Not everything needs to be easy.
---
sense of pride and accomplishment when the slot machine rewards you,am i rite?
---
Named my IE Pump Action 'Dead Before You Know It' and FE Handmade 'Splattercannon Mk II'.
---
Lol downvoting it doesn’t make it untrue, the queen isn’t a guaranteed 3 star drop no matter what you “claim”.
---
This keeps coming up as the answer but what do you mean? Have you gotten any other heads from the imposter sheepsquatch because I sure haven’t. And you can’t farm the original events the heads do come from. So what event? And do you have proof?
---
That's why I'm referencing teamwork. I'm a Bloodied build too, and I'm taking out all of the adds pretty much as they spawn, while insisting through mic that the PA'ed guys go click a button instead of dying in a circle around the invisible enemy, just to run back and repeat the process
---
I think a lot of the responses in this post get it wrong, in terms of people hiding on the roof doing nothing. I've seen quite a few people do that to be lazy and leech in case the event is a success, but you really don't wanna go activate them with a Bloodied build, that's for sure.
---
Personally, I'm doing a lot more from the rooftop sniping adds as they spawn in and dealing, I'd dare say in most cases, most of the damage to the boss once it's vulnerable. It's just the issue of getting the people equipped to use the pylons to do so.
---
Weapon (started 2 patches ago). My equipped gun is ALWAYS unloaded when I log in. I never have an empty gun. Reload early, reload often.
---
BTW I haven't seen a disappearing bag on XB1 in several patches. I drop stuff all the time. But that's only my experience....
---
I mean his flair shows as a raider so username checks out
---
Since we haven’t seen the real one yet I am going to hope that we get more revealed. Maybe in the dungeon we get next week. Maybe that is all going to be a Bysshe hq.
---
Remove your mods and custom ini's
---
Do you know if they added this to the trading window as well?  Nothing quite as nice as selling your favorited weapon at a vendor and not realizing it till you go to use it or if you do now having to buy it back for an amazingly large sum.
---
Flair checks out
---
At least it looks like they'll stick to their guns and don't try to make a Triple A game with their Indie crew. So they might have learned after all. Good on them.
---
Because the effect is awesome on shotguns, gamma guns, cyrolators, harpoon guns, etc. Everything that is kept in check because of their ammo capacity. It's a really useful perk on a lot of weapons and people will trade them for huge amounts of caps if it's on the right weapon.
---
Even if they had to limit it to say 4 presets to work alongside the console player D-Pad when in the Perk Card menu, I'd be fine with that. It really doesn't seem like it'd be that hard to implement. Though my guess is they'd have to store the data on a server. If that's the case, when then why not keep that data saved on the players system?
---
Bethesda japan need to register atom as their cryptocurrency like Bitcoin in Japan due to their stupid regulation. It will be a helluva hassle to do it &amp; I don't think it will ever be done.
---
I've been considering buying ever since I saw it for around a tenner, but it was for the PS4 version. 
---
£17 for the PC version has, to date, put me off.  Seeing stuff like the developer breaking promises on premium being cosmetic only has entirely made me more hesitant.
---
Ooo I didn’t think about that. Sounds cool to me!
---
The owner of the fallout discord server is also a creep that asks girls for feet pics.
---
And you're seeing items vanishing when dropping...not a good solution, right?
---
Yeah. That’s why I assume that is what is going on. I’m all for inquisitive vagueness. But the quest doesn’t seem to give many leads at all to what is actually going on big picture. 
---
I remember also reading a note that seems to suggest Calvin was doing the whole Sheepsquatch sighting thing to kickstart tourism in his dying town. There are so many treads and seemingly no good connection of them all.
---
It’s a picnic blanket, it’s under the floor items. Looks like a red and white rug
---
Yup do not hoard crazy amounts of junk. However I am running into this issue as well. All I hold on to are 3\* items or really good 2\*. What this game needs is a safe item for item trade system. Most of my stuff would probably make others happy and give me some items that I need. However I don't feel like going out of my way and talking to kids on discord or make a trade post on reddit that I have to check up on. trading should be in the game it's a joke honestly this isn't mentioned by beth themselves. Even a shared stash box for your characters only woudl go a long way. (No more fear of losing items because server dies shortly after trading)
---
Even the current trading screen/options just break and is incomplete. I tried traveling around and trading with people in game. It's a nightmare. I can't deny requested items so whenever vivox decides to crap itself again im stuck sending brainwaves to this other guy. The trade screen will close itself randomly. Par that with no comms makes for a short meeting and less trading. Also for the love of atom why is there not item for item trading in a game where the endgame is mostly just farming a handfull of spots for the slightest chance of  some decent gear? Is Bethesda incapable of making this reality or is throwing yourself into that grinding circle without option to trade it with others for longevity sake? I don't it's just really stupid. I don't post about because this sub is filled with "beth pls gib" post and reposts of issues that have been here so long that people have forgotten.
---
Mind sharing the "stand on head" trick? Asking for a friend.
---
No more penalizing of those who didn't read through builds and spreadsheets to optimize their build instead of treating it like a roleplaying game.
---
I used up all my luck during the beta. Literally the first Port-A-Diner you come across across the street from the church in Flatwood gave me one haha. 
---
And then a couple of weeks later I got another one in Watoga I think.
---
But that's only 2 in literally hundreds of tries. I usually hit every one I see unless I'm actively in a firefight at the time.
---
Yep it pretty much is, a couple patches ago they gave respawn times for junk and technical data anywhere from 24-72 hours.
---
I always roleplay the jump that happens when you try to attach wires as if i got a electric shock from trying to do electrical work without proper knowledge of such things.
---
Where is the new event located?
---
Definitely not too hard, it's actually nice to see something challenging for once
---
I've done it about 6-7 times and only failed maybe twice
---
Not that people know of so far. General consensus seems to be everyone gets wolf, yao guai, owlet, rad stag heads, and the picnic blanket for completing the side quests. And the side quests don’t seem to be repeatable. And the one repeatable quest, fighting the imposter, doesn’t seem to drop any additional heads...
---
"Lemme just attach the wire to my street light aaaand... Oh I'm on my roof now"
---
I know your pain mate, I know it all too well.
---
All perk cards? That will be painful on my level 202. I guess I can screenshot what I have equipped.
---
Ahahahaha, I was looking for a basket. Thanks!
---
Nope I've done 2 about to do 3 encrypted events in 30 mins 😋
---
You want 12 points in perception if you want to maximize dmg with a rifle, and bloody mess. Why would ppl gimp themselves by not maximizing dmg output??? Go ranged or melee! Despite what ppl say you cant combine them and have all
---
I love it when people carry around high end junk for no reason. Happens in survival more than you'd think too.
---
I put 2 points in each for a 45% boost
---
I noticed the same thing, hoping for an answer!
---
Im lvl 292 , 1000h of playtime so i have tried most combos btw
---
Seems like they stretched the respawn time. I do my resource collection once a day at the same time, just to mitigate.
---
I found it locking only the usable object
---
yeah but it wouldn't be affecting the magazine size bonus that would still stay
---
I'm pretty sure you don't show up if you have zero kills
---
Obviously
---
Protect and serve!
---
be smarter then the average JOE, dont go in the event with junk, and wait until the event is over to loot the dead robots. easy solution. I do agree it sucks that the voltures come out off the woods every time.  but it is what it is, learn, adjust, and move forward. you should let anyone ruin your game.
---
Good advice, I will try. Thanks.
---
Plus the Imposter has a big entrance fee, namely the assaultron recall keycard which you get for free only once and from there on have to buy for a lot of caps right ?
---
why would you want to make a good effect even better with no real reason. I mean it's awesome on some weapons and decent on others. You don't need a legendary effect to be overall superior just so that it's "useful".
---
Yep, I haven't seen any legendary robot in two days whereas they were quite a few every day before. It was great because they tend to drop more Troubleshooter's items. I was hoping to replace my earlier lvl 35 Troubleshooter's Handmade with a lvl 45.
---
I can confirm all of it; everything stated above happened to me (using plasma and laser gatling).
---
I recommend an M79, explosions work great at crippling those buggers legs making them slow crawl toward you for easy pickings.
---
You can also try to throw a grenade and do an instant vats hit right after but that does take practice in 76.
---
Tried it for the first time last night and succeeded. Definitely hard but didn’t seem SBQ-hard
---
Sorry I’m on PC
---
Can’t be bothered with daily challenges, real life is quite sufficient 🙃
---
I find VATS helps to keep them in check as well as any fast moving or burrowing enemy.
---
huh so how long has this been a thing then that people have wanted these weapons most stuff i see is recommendations to vendor those weapon types
---
Don’t listen to the previous comments. No one has any heads other than wolf, yao guai, owlet, and rad stag right now. It’s unsure how to unlock more but I haven’t heard of one single person getting them from the sheepsquatch imposter event.
---
The bullets don't hit where the sight points, but they always hit in the same spot relative to the sight. I used to use a gatling gun, I learned where the bullets would hit. Slightly up and to the right.
---
After a couple hundred rounds you should be pretty damn accurate with that thing.
---
Inform me how it went :) So i can start adding random people to my list xD
---
I believe there may be a bug currently preventing mod attachment. Maybe after today's hotfix it'll fix. I have full scout ultra-light polymer limbs and dense chest. For me only the mods that required a leveled up skill in some perk or other would attach. Those not requiring any perk would not.
---
Its the fucking shitty loot thats the problem, its endgame . The loot is the problem not the summonings
---
Lol 😂
---
It let's you filter your items really well on a separate key.
---
No not crypto currency or blockchain.
---
It just needs a 3rd Point of sale mediator to handle the exchange rates within atom store.
---
I have several locations I frequently run for legendaries.
---
Watoga **was** always consistent, and I'd have at most 2 or 3 server hops where there would be none, and that was a rare occurrence. Usually it'd be one empty run here and there with at least one legendary (usually more) the rest of the time.
---
Since the patch, they've definitely nerfed the rate that *robots* can be legendary.
---
Other locations I've hit that aren't always robots, seem to have more reliable legendary rates similar to what they were in the past.
---
I am fairly certain they have the settings for what rate things spawn as legendary based on enemy type.
---
Since the new event always spawns a fuck-ton of robots, they lowered it. Same reason (in my experience) scorched are less likely to be legendary as they're always spawned in waves by scorched beasts as well as being everywhere else.
---
it did bring some need/wanted changes, unfortunally it now we have game halting bugs. hope the hotfix bring everything back to normal.
---
You reference one sbq fight I have gotten a 1\* item at least 5 times in a row on scorched earth. Ranging from pipes to buzz saw blades. Hell I remember about 3 patches ago it was still normal if 3 out of 5 queens were unlootable. I (plus friends ofc) used to farm the queen atleast 6 to 9 times a day and never lose. Even with such a focused effort, the loot was a joke most of the time. I would get more doing a quick 4 location run between silos than the actual fight.
---
At which date is the hotfix going to be released?
---
3\* drop rate from sbq sucks. Haven't got any 3\* weapon and did defeat her lots of times.
---
But i agree with OP, drop rate for 3\* weapons is (to) low and some bosses aren't worth the fight when you see the loot they drop.   
---
Hopefully the first raid that comes next week will have loot that's worth fighting for.
---
Wood armor, shrouded mod. Escape artist, Sturdy frame perk and ultralite mods on non wood armor. Weight affect sneak.
---
Ideally you have all shrouded, and all unyielding except one piece chameleon. 
---
The rest is optional damage stuff.
---
Get a bloodied lever and do 800 per shot, problem solved
---
I feel that these numbers aren't real. My combined level is 800+ I've seen some shit and this doesn't add up.
---
Yeah, my daily farming route was to go through watoga, and I hit every spawn point along the route. I've never had more than a couple runs in a row where there wasn't at least one legendary. 
---
Since the patch I've hit it about 12 times each on my 2 &gt;50 characters and not seen a single legendary.
---
today at 10 or 11 est if I remeber correctly, its in here somewhere. thats were I found it.
---
I found the plan for this last night ironically.
---
Well damn XD, that would explain how some guy with a 100 cap bounty was able to be right next to an event I was doing and actually killed me. And here I thought he was standing just out of range of it. It would also explain why I was potentially doing no damage back to him. Thought it was because I had pacifist mode on, or because he was behind a fence and the 3rd person shooting gets all glitched when that happens. But guess it might have been because I was still doing the event.
---
There are several rewards
---
The white wolf fedora (Kind of looks like the one Michael Jackson wore 
---
Sheepsquatch costume
---
Plan: Sheepsquatch Assaultron head
---
Plan: Assaultron head
---
Base items
---
And more.
---
Thx dude, I appreciate...
---
&gt; Also, nerfed the 3\* Scorched that spawned on the 3rd floor of the Civic Center, half the time it doesn't even spawn or if it does it's just a weak "Crowned" Leader type that drops nothing of real value. 
---
They were never guaranteed spawns and were pretty rare for me. Still I got a 2\* enemy yesterday.
---
What's more worrying is that they may have changed the 2\* and 3\* item overall drop chances. I don't have enough data yet with patch 8, but it feels now that 2\* and 3\* now drop more 1\* (and 2\*) than before.
---
Holy Nice, I've just been running around with a Auto vampires tesla rifle just to not die from conduit leeching but that's not enough XD
---
I was also lucky on my first go, got a 3\* 50. Cal where its 90% weight reducted and bullets explode (pre fix is eh, assassins), but all the other times I've done the event I just got terrible 1\* armour pieces.
---
Don’t they sell pre loaded cards with atoms? Or is that only for consoles (assuming OP is a PC Champion)
---
I have maxed out 2 handed and non automatic rifles (with max demo expert, bloodied mess, incisor, and tank killer). You just pretty much can't have any other perks. Gotta choose if you want DMG or QOL, but it can be done.
---
It upsets me knowing you maybe would take my stuff. I support your right to do so however.
---
Therein lies the problem.
---
This takes coordinated and communicated efforts by strangers.
---
Each person committed to winning and completing the objectives needs to understand 
---
What needs to be done and by whom, accountability,  and where they can help, transparency.
---
If folks don’t know or don’t understand or aren’t willing to help, fail.
---
This applies to SBQ too.
---
Ooo perhaps it was a 10 then, I just remember thinking is was a great amount of damage for a low level weapon 👍
---
A true Responder.
---
Also, bring in text chat!  
---
Reading that you're on a discord channel makes me  jealous. I came across some invites, but they weren't active anymore.
---
I’ve been watching them go separate for 3 to 4k all day. 
---
Literally seen 10+ now.
---
Unless it’s one of the cryptid holotapes. Then they just say “radio drama”
---
You can’t and shouldn’t take all the hits. Either rotate off or have a dedicated doc
---
NP
---
Last couple of events I was the conduit for all 3 pylons I hope on the roof and mini nuke the mobs while the rest take the squatch down.
---
Op is trolling or really young considering how he is trying to playoff a blatant lie or mistake. Hopefully no newbie finds this post just to be let down by false information.
---
And until then legendaries should be free space in the stash... I have had to drop several 2\* stuff just to keep moving.
---
I know how you feel i honestly would be okay if the weight ended up being 1.5k because at that point if people still have issues with managing their stash its on them
---
They were added. I think with the first Wild Appalachia patch... Someone on here had their camp not load because the shack had been added.
---
I have a Vampire Cultist dagger as well. I went for something \*super\* original, and called it "Blade of Woe" from Elder Scrolls.
---
nooooooooo, pick a lock again lol. I play on xbox as well GT is the same as here, and im always looking for ppl to play with.
---
I guess it's in order to always stash all your junk before hopping over to the event.
---
more likely they will make it more complicated
---
 x-&gt;space to jump 
---
x-&gt;ctrl to crouch. 
---
x-&gt;space-&gt;tab-&gt;x-&gt;ctrl to jump then crouch.
---
Just got a Fixer today! I haven't even had a chance to use it yet.
---
How do you get it 5 times? I can't get it once.
---
Stop complaining cause they game isn’t personally tailored to you. If you made poor choices early in the game which you say you did. That’s your fault
---
Also swedish here, mostly northern europeans when I play as well.
---
No, wouldn't want to accidentaly scrap something nice. I doble check the confirmation window as well, in case
---
It’s not too hard, I think it’s good, there’s a lot of robots though
---
Interesting! Thanks for clearing that up!
---
The plans now Spawn at grafton steel in a building with an armor workbench. They are in an open locker. Still random though. Can Spawn any plans there. I jumped 50 times to get arms and legs.
---
idk man I regularly sit on like 15k but it was just a figure, I think the idea is good and the 5000 pretty much just a placeholder idk it has to be costly but convenient or Bethesda won't do it
---
Still wont get as high as focusing on one , that was   my point. You can mix but not with best results
---
That's because the Fallout franchise comes from roleplaying, not grinding for stuff. It's definately not roleplaying to do the same event over and over again, jumping servers, just to not be totally outclassed by those who did this.
---
Fallout has roots that comes from a very different background and some few players may still hang on to that.
---
i like the idea of donating caps, but not towards a SQB, if the do a guild type off thing with a lvl system I would gladly donate caps for that.
---
^this!!^
---
I mean, I’m on Xbox, so..........
---
I think the main point of not being able to do this is that if you could just level up any old weapon when you level up, it takes away from needing to go find another new weapon. I mean imagine perfect storm and you get that at level 10ish. And then that person uses that same gun to level 200, that person ultimately wouldn't need to search for new weapon again. I think that would take the fun out of search. Not only that you'd have a major issue with your stash being full of weapons. I think it'd affect the trading system as well. It would be cool but I see why they don't do it.
---
I like to follow the games progress, like its an Early Access alpha.
---
It may be the same people "roleplaying" raiders.
---
i agree completely with [chocolatekraken](https://www.reddit.com/user/chocolatekraken) and what he said. Stop complaining and go level few levels for the point changes and plan ahead this time. It's not like leveling is hard in this game.
---
Cause everyone here is biased and blind lol.
---
If you wanna be a raider, be a raider.   
---
But raiders wouldn't participate in cooperative events with other factions without giving up some of the traditional raider ways. If you opt out of societal norms, you can't just work with others on a common goal at the same time as you're working against them to pinch their stuff.   
---
Fact is, he's not a raider, he's a bloatfly doing what bloatflies do. Which is fine, there are bloatflies in Fallout, so go ahead. But bloatflies don't get to join in with the communal activities of others working together
---
tldr; Claiming to be a 'raider' doesn't excuse toxic behavior.
---
We can't even grow pumpkins. If live to grow some
---
Follow the wire slowly and land on the object you want to attach it too. Do not hover off of the object or you will have to do it all over again. Just follow the object steadily.
---
Vats will not target anything when it is in stealth.
---
It seems if you stay near the player spawn when the event starts, you’ll see creepy sheepy spawn in glowing. That may be the easiest chance to get a hit in.
---
Also, as someone who’s been stuck with being 3x conduit, Vampire’s LMG is a minor blessing.
---
Not exactly complaining as much as it is an observation. But thanks anyway.
---
Two Shot Handmade Rifle - One Point Two Five Shot Handmade Rifle
---
Yes you make a good point, it is fun hunting for a new weapon when the time comes, I didn’t mean levelling the weapons past 50, just from 10 to 50 for example, but yes you pose a good point there about the trading and stuff :)
---
They nerfed TSE hard. Specing into Shotgun perks in general and getting an Instigating might be a good alt. Heavy weapon specced, so I don't have much experience with shotguns.
---
Haven't done the event yet, but if you hit the squatch when it's taking no damage, does it still count as a tag? Seems like that would be the easiest solution. Hit it once and then go about activating pylons.
---
I used to go call them in for other people until I realised that they were getting a bounty if they unlock it.  I haven't done it since.
---
I need more! It's the guns that use it up so quickly.  Give us another 200 lbs or give us a new container that can only be found at your base that we can store things in.
---
Yes. Now I need to dedicate 5 slots on my favourite wheel to block accidentally scrapping armour...
---
We're getting there, Bgs...
---
Is there any merit or viablity in a heavy machine gun/Luck VATS crit build? I wanted to try something so I could hit enemies to gain a chance of instantly restoring Action Points and or Crit Bar, along with increasing crit damage and lowering Crit Cost.
---
I'd combine this with Party Boy and Happy Go Lucky to capitalize on the Luck and Stat Boosts to AP and Agility I can get from Wine and Rum. I'd also have Cola Nut with a supply of Nuka Cola or other sweet foods like crafted Sweet Rolls for AP regen.
---
I'd have  2 points in Gun-Fu and Adrenaline to capitalize on kills and at least one point in Concentrated Fire for the help in damage build up.
---
Other points would be used for protection, slight weight reductions, Stabalized in INT, Rejuvenated for further AP bonus, and some damage in Strength. I'm a bit busy at the moment but I could post the build link later from my PC.
---
The point really would be to just keep unleashing a wave of crits with a stream of damage that builds up.
---
Won't happen. I am glad there is an option to change some keys. The UI and button layout (double binding) are there because it's also aimed at console players. This especially noticeable when trying to build. From UI layout to the way you are able to move/place something.(hard to nail but I meant how you are allowed to adjust item position x,y,z.) 
---
It's designed with controller in mind and adjusted slightly to work on mouse &amp; keyboard. Bigger target audience and have to keep it easy so it stays accessible for a wider audience.
---
Leveling isnt difficult, however the only worth while way to do so is nuke zones as far as I'm aware.
---
Yeah because raiders wouldn’t manipulate a group of do-Gooders in order get what they want. Putz.
---
Yeah I just didn’t like the offhanded comment about someone only fighting the SBQ 2-3 times and that the loot was bugged, it’s just a silly assumption that does nothing to further discussion.
---
I like to think the mothmen we find in game are imposters. Just mutated moths. Not the true Mothman.
---
"Putz"? I assume that's 'raider' language then?  
---
Go tidy your room 'raider'
---
Shoot stims at my team I like that! Take my upvote
---
Then it could at least be changed to the E key equivalent on console. That key isn't really used when you're attaching a wire anyways and it's not the "Cancel Out" keybind/button so why not use that?
---
No I’m not desperate. The word is opportunistic.
---
Crap sorry for typo in the title I meant weapon and armor) stupid phone... :(
---
I got a 2\* TSE handmade for 1k caps two days ago on xbox.
---
*throws grenades and runs away out of convenience* *gets mad when event fails*
---
It’s hard and unfun if people don’t get the mechanics.  
---
But when you’ve got a large group of people, and at least a few of them understand how it works, it can be fun.  
---
You’ll get your win.  
---
But boy, the rewards aren’t so rewarding.
---
No because then you can't repair-all if somebody shoots your decontamination arch once because then fixing 3 broken walls would cost about 20 flux
---
Find out about locations with lots of high level super mutants and farm them. Do all the non-starting area events. Survival mode has 20% xp bonus.
---
Whole that might be true, you still have to credit him for the fact that the LGBT got much more acceptance compared to the past during his presidency.
---
Then again, some of us use controllers with our PCs.
---
I have done this... EVERY time. It doesn't matter if the wire snaps to the location, I can still end up jumping and it won't stop until I have to try a build mode reset which isn't guaranteed to fix it.
---
Pumpkins, gourds, tarberries, cranberries, and slitbeans. LET ME GROW THEM BETHESDA
---
I have seen 4 rad storms and have never observed this. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just saying I'm doubtful
---
Yeah. I still have a radio floating above my effigy fire, but I can’t turn it on.
---
I'd give you mine if I could. I've collected about 5000 since I've started playing and haven't spent a single one. I dont see the point, really. But if Bethesda starts selling legendary vendor tokens at the atom shop, which I believe they will, that will change.
---
You've made the entire point of the game for yourself to have an overpowered legendary weapon
---
Well, as it turned out, beth intentionally made camp def event say Sheepsquatch attack to fool players. They did it again for the main quest. So it's pretty clear that they're playing smoke and mirror with the cryptid.
---
There's definitely more to it. Plus, the raid is called "the burrow". And we know for a fact that the cryptid model in game exists.
---
THIS! I play on PS4, using default controls. Interact is X, jump is triangle. As soon as you hit connect/attach/make new wire (using the jump button) the interact button is useless while you are holding the live wire. So why can't the interact button become the attach wire button while holding a wire?
---
Keys yes. They get in the way of everything else in there like ore and such. 
---
The other two have their own tabs. Not at all necessary.
---
Just because you don't value cosmetics it doesn't mean others don't either.
---
So many people do transmog runs on wow. For literally no other reason than cosmetics
---
As you said, the word is schmuck 😊
---
Not sure honestly. The current button layout works and most of their focus is probably centered around resolving issues that will make people stop playing on short notice and future content. Just wish 76 too kthe route of arma or garrys mod. Let you modify the game and give server files. Arma did this and still pushed dlc that sold on the regular. Heck arma spawned some of the biggest titles today and still has some of my most favorite game types/mods.
---
This would allow people to play 76 the way they want with likeminded people and mods, QoL changes would be around more (like your keybinding).
---
You can’t get observe an opinion
---
Carry lots of fertilizer. Or some. Or really terrible junk.
---
I know, right? Mine had a core AUTOMATICALLY loaded when I equipped it.... Like.... Whoa.
---
Yeah but that's not a heavy burden to maybe travel a but when looking
---
&gt;I'm going to have to make a new character just to play how I want
---
That's how fallout games have always worked
---
So far named two of mine. The first an Instigating Gatling Gun, Grant's Fury, and a bog-standard Powerful Automatic Pipe Pistol renamed to MAC-10.
---
I guess :) mine show as raider too , but I got some  standards
---
They would need to be placed in water...
---
Stealth doesnt automatically equate to long range shooter. Besides, sniper means way more than that anyway
---
Renamed my Instigating Gatling Gun to Grant's Fury. 128 base, so it's quite an opening shot on a full health target. Easily drops most Ghouls save for Charred and Glowing.
---
5k? A bit far fetched. Maybe that would be feasible if they had an ingame market or player vending. I Am not spending 4-5 days of vendor selling just to fight the queen.
---
I'd rather solo the silo at that price.
---
Neither option makes me want to fight the queen for the   1% chance to get something useful.
---
Don't go into survival unless you are prepared to be killed. Anytime. Anywhere. By anyone.
---
I think from what heard if you scrap chassis with the armor on the armor goes to your inventory
---
That shouldn't be a problem you already have to place water purifiers in water.
---
Yeah same
---
Playing the game. But really, you can farm high level enemies at whitesprings, or take and defend workshops. Just owning a workshop is an event, and within 5 minutes another Defend event will start. Take two of the out of the way workshops, and hop between them defending and farming white springs.
---
If you have the sneak perks, you don't even need chameleon. I run with unyielding armor at 20% health all the time. No one ever sees me when I'm crouched, sometimes they actually fall over me.
---
defiantly gonna have to pick one and maybe the radtoad I usually only go for non human pops because I don't like the big head mono colored eyes aesthetic.
---
There's been underarmor on the atom store previously.
---
Yep. I heard random scottish, american, english, japanese, etc.. All here and there both same and diff servers
---
No idea i didnt try
---
After 6 finished event all  I got was 6 legendary food part and 6 White fedora😭
---
Yep, most vendors have it to buy. It’s almost easier to hop servers and hope there’s an event happening.
---
Right , you said it yourself fallout pvp isn’t like 5% skill and 95% grinding for gear . This isn’t super smash bros , go back to adventure and get better gear/build or go play a game where everyone has the same stat layout/gear/perks if that’s what you want
---
Do you still want the items?
---
I have to agree with you on that. At first though I didn't even realize there was sidequests to the main.
---
Rename the armor you wear so it is grouped together
---
Primed bloody explosive Gatling Laser = BFG 9000
---
Bloody buzz blade = Mr. Bloody
---
Haven't named my lever action yet. Leaning towards Ole' Reliable
---
The problem is, unless I'm mistaken, a camps crops with change into their restrictive flux. If you let everyone grow everything watch as the rarer flux gets farmed by nuking your own camp. 
---
A literal flux farmer putting their camp away from danger, somewhere in the forest or ash heap, use up their whole budget on all the different varieties of flux starters, and done, a flux farm just waiting for the nuke.
---
Wow that’s really shit. Haven’t done it yet and this isn’t making me want to rush to do it
---
You just keep playing. Run around doing events, launch more nukes, farm legendaries.. And if you are lv 27 i doubt you have completed every side mission there is. There are lots of daily quests too. And if you go to your map you see on top right corner some challenges you can try and complete also.
---
Make sure to check Lewisburg so you can see what kind of actual legendaries dropped and be sure to drop some off for when someone else comes to check. Got a neat 3* harpoon gun like that last night
---
This has happened to me as well it’s been months and I’ve been waiting for a patch an nothing has worked
---
I don't use VATS so I didn't even notice, lol.
---
1st I didn't downvote you. 2nd what you are doing is just as much a "claim" you cuck.
---
Try looking at the source object for a solid second (a one mississippi if you will) and see if that improves it. You can check if the bug will occur by attempting to jump at any point after, of course.
---
True and nothing wrong with that of course. You should be able to enjoy a game the way you like. I prefer some games with controller as well. It just feels like a weird hybrid sometimes (based mostly of m/k user). Like I said there are luckily some options to remap functions. But when using m/k some interactions or button combinations are just impractical.
---
Not a big complaint for me personally though. It was like this since fallout 3 and a few other games do this too.
---
Some quests are just bugged like that. My quests are the Fire Breathers physical, which I finished maybe 8 levels ago, and Listen to Rose's radio message. Just inactivate the map markers in your pip boy and pretend they don't exist
---
I bet they had two people work on their independent solutions in parallel in case one of them failed.
---
Weapon issues:
---
Gatling Plasma:
---
The Gatling plasma after reloading or loading into a cell will only fire a single shot after spinning up. After spinning up again, it will be back to full auto.
---
Additionally the Gatling plasma ammo size is randomly jumping to 0 in the middle of combat. (Eg it's slowly ticking down as you fire, maybe gets to 180 then is instantly set to 0). I can't verify if: it has anything to do with over-sized cores (those crafted with high INT), or if the ammo is lost or returned to the core pool.
---
It would be worth verifying that this happens with the Gatling laser or not also.
---
Environments:
---
From 2 patches back (one before this) the lawn on the Whitespring golf course is causing huge lag relative to anywhere else. I assume this is to do with the way the grass is rendered, and only causes the issues when the lawn is within the FOV. I also observe this near Vendor bot Wallace. (Harpers Ferry) (GTX 1080ti, latest driver).
---
Oh my word! You got one of them! The fabled... \*snort\*legendary\*snort\* drill!
---
That is so much better than a 1\* Wood Leg. You can like... scrap it for mats and stuff.
---
Baaa!
---
When I saw the mounted SBQ head, I assumed you could get if from the queen. No idea if thats the case, though.
---
There should be a chance for any creature to drop a mounted head plan for itself.
---
Yeah now when ya pull it oit it spins up fires 1 round.. Then maxes ya spin it up again.
---
Also it seems to forceablly making me press reload when the core runs out. No reload from pressing fire on a empty.
---
Seems to apply to laser and plasma
---
Let the lazy metagaming fucks have their easy game.
---
The only thing stopping me from playing half life 1 is lack of controller support on steam
---
I will try! Thanks for the comment and i haven't completed all the side quests. But some of them are too difficult for me
---
There is only one event with the new dlc, fighting the imposter sheepsquatch. I completed it first time before doing the main quest and I was pretty sure I got a plan for a head, although o am not 100 percent. I would have assumed that's how you get them but as I said I'm not sure. Sorry for the miss information
---
Bloodied Explosive Shotgun : Bloody Bitch
---
Lmao who decided on A to Cancel, B to  Confirm though?
---
What anti-tank rounds? Just because they're .50, doesn't mean they're AP.
---
Anyway, sure it is silly to think a .45 does more damage than a .50, but just pretend the .50 is FMJ and the .45 is HP. Ez.
---
There’s the main quest that you’re talking about, but the 4 notes on the wall in Calvin’s office are what spark the 4 side quests that you get the heads from. Or maybe three heads from those and the picnic blanket, and the other from the main quest. Either way, 4 are known about but like 40 others are unknown.
---
Yeah a claim that directly contradicts yours and that backs up another persons  claim you responded to with your “hmmm idk” biased ass comment. You sound real cute behind that keyboard but I would Son you in an instant and show you what a “Panickedsoul” really looks like.
---
Find out about the places where there are high level super mutants (they give very good xp, and gear) and farm those places while keeping your eye on events and such on map. Events reward nice xp. Take advantage of the rest bonus (5%) and go survival mode (it's not that scary when you get used to it xD) for another 20% bonus xp. Also there will be another double xp weekend coming at the end of month which will be on adventure mode this time also.
---
I believe any items you dump into a container stay there until the server itself restarts (or someone picks them up).
---
I have dropped items in a container on one character, logged out, changed characters, and logged back in to the same location and the items were still there.
---
Man, I hate it when my free dlc with a 10 step main quest and a half dozen side quests doesn't have enough content for me to rush through fast traveling from spot to spot without reading any of the content!
---
The person who thought that if you were spamming A to scrap youd probably spam A through this menu and end up scrapping it anyway, this forces you to stop and read the box
---
oh ok. thank you!!
---
Lifesaving gear, mysterious savior, throw in Last laugh/orbital strikes for good measure.
---
Meh, it's fine the way it is. I don't want to see some unyielding build getting rekted then come back 5 seconds later with a new build to counter someone. 
---
Current char building forced commitment. As it should be.
---
Cool. Hopefully someone spots them then. Done the same thing with a couple camp plans I got from taking workshops.
---
Probably. Containers are instanced, so it might become a cross-instanced item. I don't really know myself.
---
Your downvote only shows you run away from a real argument. Stick to the shadows son and I won’t educate you more than need be
---
I've done this, I've also tried staying on the object, holding down the attach wire button so it hasn't created the wire yet, then looked over at the other object and let go in order to create a wire from there first and then attach the wire to the other connector, all at a very slow controlled pace. Sometimes that worked but most of the time I'm back to jumping/resetting.
---
Trust me, I've been taking my time with this and tried plenty of little tricks to not have the system make me jump. This is an issue that needs to be remedied with a very simple solution.
---
Oh that's awesome! Once I have my perks setup I'll look into it :)
---
I don't use power armor much but I think this would be an awesome addition to the game!
---
If they let you "sneak" up on them with the open mic symbol constantly hovering over your head even when you are sneaking than that's on them
---
Stop building at the busiest/trolliest place on the planet? 
---
That’s like building a house on the Gaza Strip and wondering why your family got killed
---
That's the best option we have yeah
---
I've done this over 10 times and only failed it once. I've gotten 3* max level legendaries on multiple occassions. I've also gotten 1 stars and 2 though. So no it's not too hard, but people will learn how to fight it. When people started killing sbq it took time for them to learn.
---
Why are you ignoring the fact that some of you are calling for Bethesda to remove the Oxhorn reference?
---
This is not to be condesending, but do you have your normal perks on? Sometimes I'll forget to swap back after crafting or repairing something and blow through a weapons durability cause my gunsmith or makeshift warrior is not in the load out.
---
It would ideally be fixed, but for me at least it only seems to happen if I'm not looking dead on at the object, or if I'm too far away - even if you're looking right at it, if it's not highlighted you're not "actually" looking at it. 
---
Then once it happens once it won't let the attachment happen, like the wire is borked, so there's no use trying again until you've closed and come back in to build mode.
---
I think 3* should be more common but the legendary pool needs to be diluted further with more different mods to prevent a bunch of strong 3* appearing all over the place.
---
Players are know to fast travel to active events the run outside of said event and snipe in.
---
Also soon as the even is over expect a shotgun.
---
I'm out of the loop, is there any confirmed info on the legendary system you're referring to?
---
thanks for this will add it to my slowly ecpanding ini tweak
---
Perfect!  Thanks, Bethesesda..   :)
---
I didn't realize how much I missed the garden plots until I tried to lay down some defenses for crops I had planted on an incline. Had around six rows of plants, but every time I tried to put up a fence piece, I couldn't link them because the ground is uneven. Drives me nuts.
---
That would be cool. It would add a better reason to actually go out and hunt a lot of animals/cryptids.
---
&gt; The Container bit... more of a QoL issue don't you think (vs. Bug)
---
Agreed, its is more of a poor UX decision than a bug.  But it was such a bad decision (in my eyes) it is practically a bug (/wink).
---
Thanks again for your efforts.
---
No OP. If I got this box to pop up, I'd quickly read it, say "shit yeah I don't want to scrap it," and instinctively press B because that's how it's always worked in any game since the dawn of time (unless it was a Squaresoft game, but they were consistent with that).
---
If it's really your explanation, then that's fucking stupid. "You better read my whole menu that pops up, otherwise you're going to scrap your favorite weapon!" I think it's more likely that it's an egregious oversight once again than the game being worked on by petty 10 year olds.
---
Dumped items will show up. Those 20k grenades I found in a suitcase I am pretty sure were not a natural spawn.
---
Been hording stimpaks(Or Nuka Quantum), ammo(Fusion, 50. Cal, 5.56 and .308) and a couple stealth boys, oh and Plasma grenades.
---
I feel with how the dungeons are a sewer system, so close combat quarters, sniper rifles and a bloodied stealth build isn't viable, so I'm slowly changing to a makeshift Commando/Heavy Gunner.
---
That's what I thought.
---
I don’t blame them to be honest, the event is a mess to coordinate with randoms and most players are gonna keep dying by either the pylons or one hit boss, I can understand why someone who have little hope in the event and wouldn’t want to waste time and resources on it
---
Chill the fuck out dude jesus, just because you dont read infomation doesnt mean its somene elses fault
---
It's a great addition, but since most people have legendary items (which cannot be scrapped) it didn't get that coverage. Nothing but love from me though, loving this wave of new and welcome additions to 76 &lt;3
---
Uncanny Caverns might just be a reference to the lore there about the Night Kid, but if they actually throw in a side quest related to him, that would be amazing!!
---
I didn't even realize Fallout 76 had radstorms. Are there any tricks to spotting them?
---
There’s no actual end of questline reward though, find and recover is last thing and then nothing but an option to start an impossible to solo event... pass
---
Alright, I buy it. Sorry man, I have this bug too but thankfully not as severe.
---
I live in Indonesia and yes, cant buy atoms.
---
I even need vpn just to redeem the game code.
---
Haha. Ok kid, making threats.... behind a keyboard. I'm not worried.
---
Fallout 76 is not for hoarders. Let that stuff go, man. If you can't. Make a mule.
---
Oh God. You're the kid threatening me on the other thread. Lol.
---
They key is to have your base caddy corner on the map to vault 76 so you can use those as stepping stones . It’s why America owns Hawaii
---
I've got like 4 mule characters overweight with saved up legendaries, so ideally whatever the enemy is I can just throw together a set of gear specifically for that enemy type.
---
im sure 90% off players made poor choices at and early stage, I know i did. I also just finished moving points the way I wanted, yes it a pain in the ass but not hard at all to do. I can only play 2-3 hours a day when I can play, and I ussualy lvl 2 to 3 times every time a play.
---
also BGS said a prestige option is coming so you can wait for that.
---
**\[Bug\]** I think this started with Patch 7 and persisted to 8, PC. When looking at some items via Inspect (X) in inventory, I can't properly rotate the item and it just jumps back to the default view orientation. Sometimes it keeps vibrating.
---
**\[Bug\]** Viewing my excavator PA parts shows the Raider skin but I don't own that skin. [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbinyk/inspect_shows_the_raider_excavator_pa_skin_but_i/).
---
**\[Bug\]** The Tinker's Workbench shows a Repair (Space) option which does nothing.
---
**\[Bug?\]** The Scorchbeast Queen did not regenerate and fell pretty fast, twice within 5 minutes. [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbnpwg/sbq_fell_in_3_minutes_twice_optimized_build_or/). It could be those 5k bloodied melee builds or she glitched and did not scale.
---
**\[Bug\]** The Fermenter sometimes says that a particular item being fermented is in another Fermenter, even though I have exactly one Fermenter.
---
**\[Bug\]** Started with Patch 7 and persisted. Sometimes moving the mouse over an item in the transfer menu will move the selection erratically around.
---
**\[Bug\]** Probably started with Patch 7 and persisted. Selling an item and having the mouse resting over another line could make a different sell. For example, selecting a 6+ Radaway, the number selection dialog comes up. If I move the mouse over another item while the dialog is up, then press E/Enter to accept the count, the selection may jump to that different item in between the count and confirmation dialogs showing up and the confirmation dialog will now sell X amounts of that other item.
---
**\[Inconvenience\]** When trying to repair items, the (T) key now opens a repair/rename screen where one has to press (R) to do the actual repair. It would be totally fine for me if renaming was limited to the pip-boy inspect screen.
---
**\[Inconvenience\]** My brain is trained for 800+ hours to press (R) when dealing with my Stash. Now I have to press (E) as (R) does nothing.
---
**\[Inconvenience\]** Can't edit a custom name, only clear it and redo the whole text.
---
**\[Inconvenience\]** The custom name character limit is a bit low (max 24?). I can't name my weapon `Zz Handmade Troubleshooter's` as the `er's` can't be written out. (I use `Zz` so my items stay at the bottom; `ZZ` is not good because `Zealot's` sorts after it.)
---
**\[Inconvenience\]** I think plan sorting is alphabetic and ignores the `(Known)` prefix. Maybe somebody complained that they couldn't see some PA plans among the PA plans as they forgot they already knew that plan.
---
**\[Inconvenience\]** Since there is that news screen in the main menu, it takes longer for that screen to load up. In addition, the news always pops up even though I don't care. It would be great if that news would not pop up at all or could be disabled.
---
**\[Unconfirmed\]** Generally fewer legendaries and more below-enemy-star drops. Not only Watoga city had no legendaries for me neither, but Harper's Ferry and Whitesprings had fewer legendaries than usual. Also pre-patch, a 2\* dropped 2\* 55% of the time and a 3\* dropped 3\* 40% of the time. They are now down to 50% and 35% respectively. I still need more data but at this legendary rate, it could take weeks instead of days.
---
Well, in Fallout 4 your unlimited stash would not slow down the database for other players trying to access server information for hundreds of reasons. Unlimited stash space would be useless here because nobody would be able to play the game then.
---
They are constantly balancing this, and hopefully we will get more space in the future, but first server stability and connectivity needs to improve.
---
Sandwich***

Cranberries grow in bogs so unless you have a bog at your camp you can’t have any.
---
Sure Fallout works but about fallout 4 fallout Shelter and my other 50 games lol.
---
I won’t lie, after killing it for the first time my reaction was “really? That’s it?”
---
Need fusion cores up to about 30. Though want to up grade my Vampire gatling laser to.
---
I get yah, I'm sorry if I came on too strong it's just this has been a persistent issue that's really affected me when I'm trying to defend workshops. Had to defend a power plant once against a Defense Event where the enemy was two Scorch Beasts with Scorched backup. Things take a bit longer and it's not the most fun when you can't get those missle turrets hooked up. :P
---
Nuke Whitespring,one maybe two levels up each bomb
---
Last night I noticed that even though there were 20 people tied for 3rd place, one of them did in fact show on the map. 
---
Maybe its random. Maybe it takes longest life or something into account.
---
Maybe they should sell an “all day ticket” in the atomic shop so players can travel to any station on the map for free for 24 hours?
---
Todd, I’ll be expecting my commission from you in the next couple of days
---
I have 10 I've gotten from machines. I run a high luck build and have since the beta. My luck is usually around 17 or 19.
---
Your idea and having the ability to relinquish the workshop would work. that way people who want to take workshops and PVP can do so and those that just want to use it as a forward base can do so and then give it up. there should also be a 40min retake timer for those people who relinquish the workshop to stop them doing so then retaking it immediately to get the completed task loot.
---
Level 245.
---
No exploits, just been playing since launch day. Every day. Sacrificed a lot of sleep. Plus I live in Maine, so.... Winter.
---
Not a threat, don’t call me a cuck unless you want some tho that’s just low life shit.
---
Look for others who want to level alts aswell, try to get a hold of a ghouls slayers 10mm or pipe pistol and just go to whitesprings nuke zones getting a shot on each enemy
---
Unfortunately it wouldn't let me attach polymer, or ultra-light. I was hoping to use those on all pieces for the ap bonus and decent armor rating.
---
\&gt;  people will trade them for huge amounts of caps if it's on the 
---
\&gt; right weapon. 
---
So what do you think a L50 quad bbl shotgun might go for?
---
I have 2 pies, how much they worth?
---
Oh god you’re the guy that can’t defend his own premise and doesn’t even try to, how does you calling me a cuck and me telling you to come get some become a threat? You’re obviously into getting cuckholded and I’m simply willing to oblige you bruh
---
On a somewhat unrelated note, I wish they did a system similar to Rust where you could run wires down walls or through them easily. The conduits are a real pain when passing through walls, why can't they just make a connector to connector pass through wall conduit instead of the unnecessary connector splitting into lower and upper conduits thing we have currently?
---
Rather get Batteries Included over Power User. That way you can carry 10 fusion cores at the weight of one. They are easy to farm.
---

What is Endgame?
---
Bullshit.  I should not have to log off to avoid griefers.  There are legitimately consensual PVP parts of the game.  In fact the vast majority of PVP requires consent to have any consequences.  Notice I was specifically not bitching about those activities.  The one aspect which does not are camps, its literally the only time someone can negatively affect you and you have no recourse but to log out of the game, which is a bullshit recourse.  Griefers can roll up to my camp, destroy it in minutes with nearly no risk and no reward other than the joy of fucking me over.  The cost of rebuilding repeatedly can get high, again with zero ability to mitigate if I do not choose to engage the griefer or choose to not be forced out of the game.
---
I fully support your right to live out your murder and rape fantasies in game, though I admit I roll my eyes at it.  What I do not support and am asking for remediation on is your ability to suck me into your gameplay.   Your free choice ends where mine begins.  Fortunately we can segregate the experiences pretty easilly, which they have done for the most part, with the one exception of camps.  Sounds like its a message Bethesda heard.  Unlike griefers, oh excuse me "edgelord raider RPers."
---
Yeah, I went from 60 to 100 in a pretty short amount of time doing nuke zones.
---
3 stars at the very least.
---
I think I know where that came from. Spoilers: &gt;!The guy who rebuilt it didn't know where this model of Assaultron came from, but it obviously belonged to the Scorchbeast Queen.!&lt;
---
Yes, will be on again tonight around 7pm
---
I left packages, was wondering if people seem or got them. Wish to could leave a note, would be cool for fellow fallout fans to see.
---
Bruh? Jesus Christ...
---
I have something like this perkwise:
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f4548c8&amp;d=sd2su2so2sp2pc1pe0e60eh2c72ic1ib4ir0a72as2au0a01la0l71lt2lu1eo0pq0aa0a40am0s01sg0&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f4548c8&amp;d=sd2su2so2sp2pc1pe0e60eh2c72ic1ib4ir0a72as2au0a01la0l71lt2lu1eo0pq0aa0a40am0s01sg0&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=) 
---
Also have two mutations at the moment; marsupial and speed demon.
---
Always have a good melee weapon to use in tight spaces, not only to prevent yourself from blowing up yourself but also keep ammo consumption down a bit.
---
It was a while ago, but something about players over 50 becoming legendary and starting from level one with better perks or something.
---
are you on xbox one?
---
I can't upvote enough. I'm with a group last night and they're all trying to locate it while cloaked, like hide n seek, meanwhile I'm melting trying to get pylons
---
I think your going to be waiting a long time for that.
---
probably b/c the original function would have not allowed the effects of nukashine... or anything made in the new stills/fermenters.  
---
Allows you to complete the 'while drunk' challenges/quests without unequipping the card.
---
Im still gonna try bloodied melee but i bought a bloodied fatman for 2k+  dmg from range. Saving melee dmg chems too
---
What do you mean?
---
Hardcore! Ready to fight! I don't want to see you out there. Ha.
---
A friend of mine too, it's pretty often
---
That makes sense, i just assumed that they were supposed to work with the card originally and this was the simple solution.
---
But putting it like that, makes a lot of sense.
---
I'm a heavy/stealth sniper build but I did use to be a stealth shotgunner with a quad explosive combat shotgun before the great nerf.
---
First of all, you have a pretty solid build right there with all shotgun enhancement perks.
---
One thing I would mention is that with a Combat shotgun, also put a suppressor so you can use the Mr Sandman perk so at night you do extra sneak damage, since bashing (unless your shotgun is like 40% extra bash damage) to have a chance to repair itself won't be good with a TSE shotgun, since that can still K.O yourself if too close. Also using the suppressor and maybe adding a perk to sneak better would mean you can do a bunch of sneak criticals for longer while not being spotted. I've managed to sneak around whitespring gold club and west tek without being spotted when I used a stealth shotgun build.
---
Skeet shooter is nice, does concentrate the spread so mostly all pellets hit, but sometimes being able to just blanket mobs with an explosion is really helpful, especially when there's a bunch of under levelled enemies heading your way.
---
A mention on a TSE shotgun, it only add one extra pellet which doesn't do much and with the heavy nerf, a standard Bloodied or Instigating shotgun does way more damage(My bloodied bolt action pipe pistol does twice the damage over a Quad Explosive XD), but TSE guns can sometimes-still be viable when used and specced correctly.
---
I would recommend a Hardened Receiver, since the best auto mod for the combat shotgun isn't that all fast, plus you can click/trigger pull faster than the auto mod. An Ultracite receiver is okay, but you do burn through shotgun ammo quickly unlike a double barrel or Pump action.
---
Another mod to have is perforating mag for Superior armour penetration. Yes the Drum magazine has a better ammo capacity, but with armour penetration this would increase damage done to the enemy as it would ignore a % to their defensive stats.
---
VATS is good and all, (use a reflex sight to decrease VATS AP usage) but they do drain fusion cores so it isn't recommended to use VATS all the time when in PA.
---
That's the problem I'm having as well.
---
ROUS's? I don't believe in them.
---
And now we see you reverting to personal attack in order to not answer my question, what other armor requires counters besides sentinel/cavalier? There is none therefore your argument is false, this armor is unbalanced compared to other armors and should be brought more in line. I say this as someone who owns a full set but can still recognize that it makes PvP limited to only people with lots of time/resources to commit.
---
I thought it was a datamined atom shop plan, is it not?? (I'm hoping not, I already have my eye on so many already).
---
E.g sheepsquatch or even SBQ for the tanks and DPS where a roving medic could actively manage the team 
---
You could have folks pool their Stims and serums and mutations into the team, make it really interesting !
---
And what Endgame Content can you do with 3 stars, new 3 star mobs in different locations... to get new 3 stars?
---
Can't attach any mods, weapon, armor, or power armor.  Should be a patch today to hopefully fix it, (and maybe other things).
---
Does explosive work on explosive weapons?
---
I farm WestTek when I want to farm XP. I leveled up 20 times in one day server hopping that place on Saturday and got a lot of legendary items.
---
That is an interesting idea!
---
This. Much as the loot was disappointing, I enjoyed the heck out of the first attempt I joined on, and even though we failed I was giggling at the —sheer— shear chaos the entire time!
---
Your arguement is that endgame armor shouldn't exist. All armor should be the same strength and lvl 5s should be the same as lvl 50s and there should be no point in grinding for gear. That's ridiculous.
---
Yeah containers and such have a cooldown for you to loot them. However if you jump between survival and adventure you can loot them both, and usually they'll reset so you can keep jumping between them and looting, sometimes it doesn't though so I'm not sure what actually is the trigger for it.
---
At least Beth will get the news that players wouldn't mind wacking an invisible enemy. "More damage done to it while cloaked than uncloaked... Huh." We can get a raid enemy out of it
---
There are also apparently missable side quests if you go back to the taxidermy place. Cannot confirm, intending to check it out later myself.
---
Reported rewards were mounted animal plans amongst others. This was in another thread on this sub.
---
I’m hoping for legit 4 and 5 star drops 🤞🏼
---
I'm all for Bethesda going back in and updating their weapons to remove any bugs but the shotgun perks really did makes sense for this weapon
---
My current build puts my opening shot at something like 380.  Damage only goes up as I kill more things. I've seen it over 600 when I'm hitting a streak.
---
They are in the game and they are badass. I love my bloodied pole hook.
---
No, the patch a while back reduced bobby pin weight from 0.1 lbs to 0.001 lbs.
---
Some items that actually have a weight in the thousandth range don't display weights because the display is only shown to be two significant figures.
---
Honestly I'm hoping they finally add 4  and 5 stars for the raids. I'm confused, are you arguing against wanting the endgame content to drop good gear?
---
I really wish the demolition perks along with the shotgun perk still applied to this thing because I think at that point it would be viable but not overpowered
---
RIGHT!!!
---
I would literally implode with excitement if this happened.
---
Chill man😂. He’s making he most of chance he has and playing the game how he wants.
---
You're just wrong. And you're the one that needs to chill out if you think a game should "punish" a player for clicking through a menu too quickly
---
2 parts to this - recall keycards and server cool downs.
---
Recall keycards - You will get one of these for free when you complete the main quest. After that you have to buy a Recall keycard circuit from a vendor. You can use the responder vendor in whiterpings, others may work I haven't tried them - costs about 2k caps. And then you have to craft the keycard at a tinkers workbench under quest items - it needs fluorescent flux.
---
The server cool down will kick in after an event has been done, you won't be able to use the terminal. I think it take 40mins to cool down.
---
gauss cannon- speed kills
---
combat rifle- this machine(kills Communists) bouns points if you get the reference 
---
laser rifle/pistol- flashlight
---
sniper rifle- against all tyrants
---
You'll notice that if you immediately load into a new server, go to the map straight away and look for the map icon, it won't be there. It's the same for Biv's place and the reason why if you rush there after loading the door will be boarded up.
---
The game seems to load-in the vanilla map first, then loads in the changes after.
---
Who hurt you?
---
I agree
---
Lol you’re obviously too dim to even try to have a discussion with, that’s not my argument at all. There shouldn’t be a set meta like this and it ruins the experience for newer players who weren’t around during the duping phase and couldn’t get their hands on this type of armor. The likelihood of someone having a full set even with trading should be so slim but it’s not, still the entry cost to obtaining these sets is something that even end game players can’t afford at this point. The fact that you can’t realize the disparities between this armor set and others and don’t see that as unbalanced in PvP shows how biased you are.
---
I renamed my X01 to
---
! X-01 Power Armor
---
It did not capitalize, so the dash wasn't the cause (PS4 at least).  I did not yet try erasing to ! to see if just X-01 Power Armor forces it to capitalize.
---
More like 1000 Caps is 10 atoms
---
Censoring is not putting youtuber names in videogames. The less youtuber names, the censoriest it is.
---
Almost forgot:
---
**\[Bug\]** Since Patch 7 and persisted. Reloading a weapon won't load a full magazine sometimes despite having way more ammo for it on me. Happens to my Drum Mag Handmades: I have maybe 10 rounds left, hit reload, the reload finishes and now I have 62 rounds (or 83 or whatever). (All my Handmades are Drum Mag'd so don't know how if other mags are affected or not).
---
Nothing cause it’s gonna be easy
---
I found if you have completed "officer on deck", that "hide, seek and destroy" quests for code pieces give a good amount of Experience for what you need to do.
---
I agree with a lot of your posts man but I don’t agree with baseless insults like you calling me a cuck for no reason. I’m not trying to make enemies here but I won’t allow someone to insult me like that end of story.
---
There shouldn't be a Meta?!?!?! What?! There had always been and always will be a Meta in game with RNG and that's just all there is too it. I'm not saying it isn't one of the best armors, I'm saying it isnt invincible the way people say it is.
---
If they do pay to win, there won't be much players anyway.
---
You could ask the same about half the holotapes in any of the Fallout games that have them
---
There are clear spoilers in the post titles, kinda bummed me out.
---
At that speed we soon hit Beta, can't wait until they release 1.0!!!
---
The event is here to stay.
---
Well, being lucky enough to find a Rad Storm in 24 hours, and then also be able to get to a Glowing Enemy within the few minutes it exists, only gives you 10 atoms.
---
Beth would probably put a Cap to Atom ratio would have to be closer to 25,000 caps to 10 atoms.  (Congrats, you reached 25,000 caps cap!  Give them up and you can get this 10 atom reward!)
---
I've been playing Anthem. It's a super awesome game. But I haven't reached the endgame yet where everyone complains about the loot. I think the loot is the only thing people really complain about.
---
The Mistress of Mystery still can bug out when trying to get the Voice of Set, Blade of Bastet, and Phantom Device. Where the quest procs you to listen to the Novice Holotape, and Cryptos is blank. Still stuck at that part for a few weeks after trying everything (unmarking and running some other quests, trading those three items to the character after listening to the tape, spamming the cryptos computer, nothing works) They really should have an abandon quest feature as they do in other fallout titles so I can start over.
---
Tbh mostly by luck. I logged in for the first time since the patch and the event popped up 10 minutes later..so I joined. I was working from home and just bounced around servers. Just kept getting lucky... Luckier we managed to drop ISS 4 times (while on my heavy/PA main) through sheer firepower....the 1 catastrophic fail was on my non-pa vats/crit/sniper alt, that couldn't carry the mass of people humping doorknobs
---
Yeah, Dupers are the fallout 76 version of synths.  
---
Explosive gun? Duper.
---
Outfit you haven't seen? Duper.
---
Killed by someone? Duper.
---
While wearing power armor? Super Duper.
---
Lol alright way to avoid the rest of what I wrote, sure there can be a Meta but it shouldn’t be a basically unobtainable armor set that’s only prevalent because of duping. I’ve found 3 Assasins sentinel pieces in 600 hours of gameplay, some people don’t have the time to invest in this game like that and shouldn’t be punished as a result.
---
T-Posing Marsquach?
---
They mostly want explosive on their shotgun too, so they don't have to aim on the body and spray the ground under someone with a stealthboy. It's quite useful in pvp. If you got some Quad explosive double barrel easily 10k upwards, but also depends on the platform you playing on. Xbox prices are somehow a lot lower than PS4 and PC.
---
All I wish is to have better RNG drops  to give me a good solid 2\* or 3\*, but I also hope to see new weapons in the game, already tired of the ones we have. I NEED MORE TO HORDE ARGH XD
---
I don't expect 4\* 5\* drops to happen until nuclear winter, since on the roadmap it said "New Features" with 5 stars under it.
---
Not that it matters when the spoilers are in the titles themselves :)
---
Personally I'd much rather an increase to CAMP budget
---
Haha. "Cuck" isnt exactly a serious insult. I dont really think you like watching your significant other get railed. You make some good posts as well, maybe I stepped over the line. Just on night shift but had to come in on day shift on my day off and just having a shit day. My B dude. You have a point on Seninal Assassin but I just dont think its God mode like people say and I dont think it should be nerfed, I think instead we need more armor like it so that it isnt the only options and more weapons like the explosives so that they arent the only option.
---
This video gives you a nice overview:

Why does the excavator armor now appear to have bones and a animal skull look to it? I almost sold my excavtor armor pieces to the vendor because I thought it was something else.
---
Kind of feeling like someone needs to get on the mic when the quest starts, telling people to:
---
1. Activate pylons (as it says on the screen); whoever does this needs at least 10-20 stims--that's what it took me this morning and the team was fairly efficient.
---
2. Hit the ISS/SSQ only when it is vulnerable.
---
3. Take out the mobs if you are a lower level, otherwise the ISS/SSQ will eat you as a light snack. Cannot overstate this enough, those things just keep spawning and spawning and spawning and some folks need to focus on those rather than the ISS/SSQ.
---
I dont think you are wrong about the time constraint of trying to get a set but I think we should have less shit legendary effects and more good ones so that this isnt an issue.
---
Wait for them to fix what they broke. Hopefully today.
---
Alright well sorry if I offended you as well I definitely can over react sometimes, agreed.
---
Got kicked off twice last night (PC)
---
Agreed
---
I think he meant the laser head gun thing
---
Nerfing the hats was absolutely necessary. and I was crafting them and it got me so many caps. But it’s awful game design to allow players to just sit and craft a pointless hat to sell to vendors for very little effort vs reward, I think we all know that
---
Follow the edge of the lake. There is a stream that leads upwards to the left (looking at the lake from the shack). There is a note next to where the stream and lake meet. Took me a while too.
---
Bummer, was going for that Fallout 1/2 plain jumpsuit look. Thanks for the info and for looking out!
---
It is a reward from Biv. First give away, the “Stairs with posts” which is an unreleased atom shop item still has the atom shop symbol. Second, they are the same kegs found in biv’s den. Third, I came across a player at his camp yesterday who got it as his reward from doing one of those Tipsy Taste Test dailies for Big. I thought it was just a decoration piece, waved to them, and walked onto the next part of my quest. Later looked into the keg on the camp item list and saw it said it dispenses mixed drinks.
---
I also hated when I was in Flatwoods listening to the Mothman Part 1 and Part 2 holotapes when I first started playing, and the Fertile Soil event started.  Stopping my holotape from playing, and forcing me to reset it from the beginning.  And there doesn't seem to be any sort of way to fast forward or rewind.
---
I would also like to option to automatically silence or reduce chat volume when I start to play a holotape.  Too often I'm doing a quest and I have to tell my friends to quiet down so I can hear this stuff.  And I don't know of any quick way to silence chat, other than menu diving, and by then I've already missed the tape.
---
Besides the DC issues noted in other comments, love this idea.
---
Problem I find is that they would need to introduce some UI to show that you are " participating", i.e you were securing x pylons, killed y mobs or dealt z damage
---
To that, we should remove the legendary drop and make a random  3* legendary part of the quest reward if you contributed enough.
---
Bethesda has directly made many changes to the queen over the course of time.  Its directly in the patch notes.  Here is one that goes back to Dec 2018!
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a4dlez/bethesda\_increased\_scorchbeast\_queen\_damage/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a4dlez/bethesda_increased_scorchbeast_queen_damage/)   
---
They also played with scaling the SBQ as people arrived in order to counter the duped TSE where she would die in like 15 seconds.
---
On PC you need to have the chasis in your inventor, then press X to inspect and then press V to rename.
---
It's similar to console, you just need to inspect the item and it should be at the bottom telling you what button you need to press to rename it.
---
It's all good. Lol. Sorry about the whole thing. Someone said that the nuclear winter update on the roadmap has five stars at the bottom of the picture. I hope its not that far away.
---
Inspect the Chassis.  Then hit the Rename button prompt.
---
In your inventory, view it (L3 on PS4) then you’ll see the option.
---
Just found it. Thanks much!!
---
TLDR: You don't know enough at your level to understand how pointless that decision is. This game isn't meant to be that easy to "beat".
---
I'm currently 276, I've never launched a nuke without it being a tagalong situation, even then it's less than 10 that I've helped with.
---
I don't grind.
---
Been here since beta, leveled by playing the game, exploring, discovery, meeting people and getting even better playing with and learning from them.
---
I've switched my build 3 times now, not including the noob starter "build" I cobbled together before I had a clue. A fallout friend just turned level 90 and finally decided on a build he liked, is currently playing with the adjustment in mind. He and a group of us at different levels:
---
We don't grind.
---
You don't have to grind for levels, if you feel like you are and aren't enjoying it, if you want to get everything you can out of fallout76, I suggest a rethink of how you look at the game and how you play. A lot of people quit because they think scorchbeat queen is the actual end of the game, only in one story line is it.
---
Just like all fallout games. Except this one is far more interesting and intricate.
---
You can restart all you want, you'll just get bored running the same crap you had to when you began, only to get higher level and realize there's actually a better build you didn't understand.
---
While I think a stash limit of 1000 would be great. Let's be honest. You are still going to run into the same problem, because you will always be keeping stuff. More stash limit will just mean more hoarding for you.
---
And that will just mean there are more items you want to keep, even though you may never use them. I'm like that with clothes, and I am thankful that most cosmetic items only weigh. 0.1
---
So learn to let go.
---
IIRC, it dispays a screen showing the required mats - if one (or more) lines are greyed out, then you are lacking enough of that material. 
---
 It'll still let you hit the button even if you dont have the materials, it just wont fix it.
---
I just kept getting disconnected and this is where I’d put my participation trophy, IF I HAD ONE! (Reference to fairly odd parents)
---
ಠᴗಠ
---
But why is B ‘yes, scrap it’ and A is ‘no, don’t scrap it’. Guarantee I’m going to get fucked over by this
---
As one with pie, I drink deeply from your frustration.
---
woah woah woah woah,
---
WOAH!
---
^(and other plants too plz n' thanx)
---
I just entered a world and a mole rat brood show up lol
---
Always wanted to drill an Assaultron.  Giggity.
---
That implies legendary players
---
I completed it for the first time yesterday and got a T-45 jetpack plan, a imposter sheep mask and a Two-Shot Fatman, lol.
---
I was lucky enough to replot my course @ about lvl 35 so I got my sneak rifle build with rather little grinding to work (started with VATS pistol build). But I agree the effort to respec completely is not worth the grind &amp; time.
---
i do have more than enough mats to repair, shit I think I got enough mats to craft a hole new lvl 50 set if I wanted too. 
---
that was the first thing I checked, but thanks :).
---
Me too, I also notice that it forces you to reload when wearing power armor and the fusion core goes empty.
---
Aaronholt Farmstead in the north east corner of the map provides cranberries, and there is a junk harvester out there too. not a bad place to camp up at. I start my games off collecting cranberries and sleeping.
---
I'm sorry you had that experience. I've done it three times so far and all three times players have revived others (I have, too - I love reviving fallen players), plus we've won the encounter.
---
The SMB mentality: squish bad guys, find the way through the dungeons, rescue princess, rinse n repeat.
---
It's an incorrect way to view this game, so many many people are frustrated because of it. It's a game you enjoy ~~when you don't have server issues that day~~.
---
You can only bleed out for 30 seconds.  Someone will have to maintain you by reviving you before the counter expires.
---
Yeah I don’t necessarily think these sets should be nerfed but like you said there needs to be other options, I think the problem lies with the whole damage system in general and it’s hard to balance legendary effect for both PvE and PvP at the same time. I don’t know what the solution is but I’d like people to feel more inclined towards playing PvP because I find myself in the same couple servers with the same people every time I play.
---
Inspect  then Rename
---
In the ash zone is where the event popped up. Got there, others showed up, beast showed up, freezefest.
---
Had to do it again yesterday. First the game runs like smooth butter and in a few minutes the start stop start stop lagging begins
---
My gun broke mid fight yesterday and I just stuck to a pylon and killed anything that came in melee range. We didn't complete the event.
---
Back when it was 400, people managed just fine.
---
com·plain
---
/kəmˈplān/
---
verb
---
1. express dissatisfaction or annoyance about something.
---
This post is too real
---
When are we gonna see a 4* loot?
---
Really? Well my bad
---
Upvote because shit like this is cool. I did something like this in Rust, and it was mildly successful, and I reckon the same can be said here.
---
Leeching is not specific to this event, I see this kind of behavior very often during the scorchbeast queen for example.
---
I think every badge along the bottom links to something they already have mentioned.
---
I think its a bug, when you damage a legendary creature and died, and finally kill him he will drop multiple legendary.
---
I encountered this too
---
\&gt;   No one will attack me to clear my wanted status... 
---
Because there are (too many) occurences of such a scenario being a trap.
---
  I do you the favor of killing you to remove the bounty, your friend in chameleon takes me out with a high power weapon, you both share the dropped junk.
---
You can damage it while it is cloaked but it is very hard to do since you can barely see it.
---
for me that was the best part off the patch
---
Last time I was wanted no one seemed to want to kill me. I just sat on a bench at Charleston train station and then went out and thankfully I was dead when I got back.
---
Lol it was a joke jeez
---
Idk if this qualifies for an r/woosh
---
Cuz this game is gud
---
I took up a support position yesterday on top of the little house, no PA but chameleoned and sniping/chucking grenades. It really helps having some more specialized roles like that. And grenades don't give a shit if the 'squatch is invisible.
---
Yeah, you just have to insert the holotape to play the game.
---
My first failed attempt, I went to activate the pylon and over the ridge I saw so many Mr. Gutsies that it was like a small army. Plus half as many protectrons. So maybe 15 enemies?
---
Most probably dont want to waste stim on you since you respawn really close.
---
Since your already dead....
---
I was there on the last section. With ghoulish and being the conduit you actually heal just as fast as you get damaged.
---
Well when they try to balance the legendaries for PvP they ruin them. In ome of my previous posts I showed 2 videos of two separate people of very different lvls being attacked by 2 totally different weapons gaining all of their health back after going down to one health like enemies did when the game 1st came out. If you do too much damage then you do no damage right now. I dont know how they can fix PvP but it feels almost hopeless. It's either ruin Legendaries or let everyone get one shot constantly at this point.
---
He doesn't take damage if he's invisible
---
100% agree, it's nice to be able to go to the closest shop and sell instead of trying to remember if you drained that faction of caps yet. It's also nice not having to go to the furthest away vendor just because they still have caps.
---
I’ve learned not to even try to help people. Kill everyone on sight or they will kill you. In events, in their houses, feeding their cats. It’s doesn’t matter burn that asshole down, adopt some new cats.
---
I  don't in any way disagree, the point is the extremely limited time.offering is a somewhat compulsory timeline. You MUST spend the money NOW.
---
thats a pro tip
---
Might've done if OP hadn't delivered the punchline :p
---
😭😭😭 meanie! Haha
---
It's amazing when no one knows how to do the event so I have to deal all the damage while also being all 3 pylons, but that doesn't happen all the time
---
Someone said the nuclear winter update in the roadmap had 5 stars in the picture so maybe then?
---
Totally agree. It's definitely an improvement. There were many times I wanted to sell stuff, but didn't feel like fighting my way to a vendor (Wallace, Watoga, Phoenix) so I'd just skip doing it, sometimes for weeks at a time.
---
But this implementation is just lame. 
---
Nice QoL improvement, terrible presentation.
---
Satisfaction?
---
Sweet!
---
Whoa!
---
None at all? That feels kind of unbalanced... but I guess it's Bethesda, so 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Nothing 'cause I don't have stash space to save things. I'm probably hoarding a few too many legendaries for the legendary vendor.
---
He's got a cloaking shield on, that's the fight mechanic. I'm sorry to say that you're part of the problem. Take out the mobs at least haha
---
Least you had pie! Haha
---
I been looking for good legendary wood for my stealth build.  That IS a good drop!
---
I agree. Server stability at the queen fight has greatly improved and the latest flock of triple digit level players are finally getting their strategies in order. I server hopped all last weekend and did probably 20 or 25 queen fights. Lost one, mainly because there wasn't a single person over level 80 at the fight besides me and most of them were under 50. They didn't have any gimmicks, she wouldn't stay on the ground, there was only so much I could do.
---
You are never safe, even during events.
---
I changed my name, it shows your new name on fallout 76
---
i do.
---
Ummm.. no.
---
That would trivalize Legendaries.
---
Now if they made the supply drops thingy only drop off bosses or 3 star legendary mobs in place of the normal legendary they drop, then sure!
---
1400 is part of update. Zero caps display error is super common and pretty old
---
Wow thank you so much much for the gold! It's my first award ever!
---
My fear
---
Stealth Commando...
---
Where on the map does the event show up?
---
Four Leaf Clover
---
 \- Each hit in V.A.T.S. has an excellent chance to **fill** your Critical meter. **(note it says FILL)**
---
Psychopath
---
\-  Any kill in V.A.T.S. has a 15% chance to **refill** your Critical Meter. **(Note it says REFILL)**
---
Critical Savvy
---
\- Critical Hits now only consume 55% of your critical meter. 
---
Summary
---
4LC fills your crit bar a bit on each hit, Psychopath has a 15% chance to completely refill it....
---
1 - If you use Crit. Savvy (Crits only cost 55%)  it is better to have 4LC instead of Psycho.
---
2 - If you **do not** use Crit. Savvy, then Psycho would be more beneficial instead of 4LC.
---
What do you think u/La3Rat ?
---
I think they did it on purpose to make a point. People have been complaining about having to travel to the different vendors to make 1400 caps a day, so they stuck them all in one place. And they also pooled all the vendor caps so that you can basically do all your cap farming at one single vendor. 
---
Now there has been multiple posts about how bad this was, and how it really ruins the game because it doesn't make sense to have those vendors there.   
---
When they try and create a more realistic world, people bitch and bitch and bitch. When they make an easier world, but at the cost of a more realistic world, people bitch and bitch and bitch. 
---
Please one side, piss off the other. 
---
Honestly where could they have put the bots that would have made realistic sense? Behind the counter? Wandering around? The fact that other faction vendor bots are in Whitesprings *makes no sense at all*. More so because now the 1400 caps a day pool is shared by all robots. So there really isn't any need to do this, is there? Go to one vendor, anywhere in the game, and you can do all your cap farming at once.
---
This morning (my third time doing the event), I decided to take care of one of the Pylons, the one down the cliff a bit. Aside from having to use 10-15 stims, I think I only had maybe 3-4 Protectrons/Mr. Gutsys come at me. I was surprised as I thought I'd have to protect myself a bit more than that.
---
But yeah, the first two times I focused on clearing them out, would turn around only to have 5-6 Mr. Gutsys shooting me. Lots of jumping, running, and swinging my axe just to stay alive!
---
I changed my use key to F and now I have to press "ENTER" to place things in my camp as the functionality of F is still to turn the item in place. Really stupid design imo.
---
Be pretty good for PVP too to counter bloodied builds. Fire a radaway or a stim pack to reduce their strength buffs and damage outputs.
---
thx.  
---
IDK if its explosive. 
---
I'm a melee build w/ no shotgun perks, and don't PvP... 
---
Even so, a couple K caps is way better than vendor price :)
---
One of those was mine!
---
&gt;when I died, my garbage was stolen.
---
That's the one thing about this event that sucks. It encourages shitty people to sit on the roof and look for loose junk bags because you typically die at least once during this event.
---
Hopefully they implement no-camp zones in whitesprings when this is done!
---
Choosing a Power Armor name can be difficult please consider the consequences of naming your Power Armor after a state or car. Mercedes and Dakota almost guarantee your Power Armor will be spinning around a pole choose wisely.
---
lol.
---
Well dang! I'm gonna make a new character to try this out! I never knew it was silenced by default.
---
I've heard he takes chip damage while cloaked/shielded, but even if that's true, the chip damage isn't enough to beat the event timer.
---
On my way
---
LOL!
---
I'm a conduit runner as well, last night I did a large amount of activating ~~and dying~~, but also took major damage off it as well. When event succeeded, I got loot like it was a regular version of the boss.
---
Is the legendary even guaranteed?
---
Just Northwest of Lewisburg
---
was!!!
---
Oh yes, I totally agree with you on that. Perfect QoL, but the implementation and presentation are something to be desired.. Unfortunately.
---
I find this happens when I try to string wires between a few things, for some reason the 2nd wire, when started at the recently attached connector, will jump instead of attaching on the 2nd connection.
---
10 atoms for 100 caps? Caps aren’t hard to get, especially with the shared cap pool, what’s to stop players from constantly making new characters and selling stuff and deleting said character after transferring caps
---
Remove your custom ini's + mods and try again
---
hah...never experienced this until about 2 days ago. I was hooking up the powerbox to the machine that makes Blamco Mac and Cheese. I was with a friend who was like, "Whatchu doin?" Hopping up and down I replied, "I'm trying to MAKE SOME GD MAC N CHEESE!"
---
Perfect! Thank you for the heads up. Now I dont have to server hop constantly to get the drops :)
---
It is, but its kind of sad that people are going to the event to just take other peoples bags and not help at all with the objective.
---
Please explain I dont understand what you mean
---
Game broke cant place pre made mod on anything currently
---
A couple pop ups I didn't get to see, perhaps I need to find a - what I completed during this time. Are all mounted heads added to the droppable loot tables now? I got a few during this quest line.
---
I think they need to make these all configurable in the settings, it’s annoying to have the buttons changed in a random patch especially buttons that scrap all or interact with inventory. 
---
It’s a good idea if we can remap to whatever we want.
---
I'm so damn excited now
---
All you have to do is go from the item that has power to an item that doesn't it completely removes the jump, the jump is when unpowered goes to unpowered
---
So its impossible to get a dence mod on armor right now then I'm guessing
---
Cookin Pot anf Wood crates where always there. Its my Camp location, nothing new there since Wild Appalachia Patches :x
---
Pisses off players to NO end*
---
Perhaps people are collecting/retaining legendaries in anticpation of player vending?
---
I'll put it to the test later and get back to you ;)
---
If you have installed mods to the game or custom ini files remove them and try again. If not, ignore what i said and my post :)
---
Do you know if there is any way of locking a go to weapon?
---
Ah ok. Yeah I'm on ps4 so no mods lol
---
Only if you know the plans yourself. I was trying to put a medical pump on my x-01 yesterday with no luck
---
Yeah but if you don't play the same way as someone else you're not playing the game right.  According to them.
---
Ahh right, thanks
---
This confuses the console controller.
---
What's your build? Bloodied?
---
did you watch it, there are some significant advantages
---
Is this just a list of NEW bugs? Because there’s a lot of old but significant ones that still aren’t patched. 
---
More bugs: 
---
Every load-in, If you have a weapon *out* (equipped but holstered is fine), it will be empty, and require reloading. 
---
Recon scopes won’t show the pip while scoped in. They do when you unzoom, but that is kind of backwards (actually I haven’t verified if this continues in patch 8, but it’s been a thing since patch 7, maybe even 6)
---
Regular armor mod that reduce power attack cost (aerodynamic? ) don’t stack, so having both arms Aerodynamic is wasted. Possibly intended, possibly a bug. If intended, it should have some note saying as such. 
---
Energy weapons still don’t work with armor reducing effects. And I haven’t even heard this be acknowledge by Bethesda.
---
Explosive vents still don’t work. Also haven’t heard this be acknowledged.
---
Cap stash detector noise still plays on empty cap stashes. With so much being personal instanced world loot now, I feel like they should just revert the container change they made to cap stashes and just make them personal instanced loot. 
---
Medium recon scopes still don’t exist. Just... why. Long is useless, short is fine but it’s... short. 
---
Actually I should stop listing mods. This’d be a hundred + items long if I listed all the issues with armor/weapon/mods.
---
That’s actually the raider rose quest karma 
---
Buff to strengthen and reduce power and damage 
---
But you’d need a partner to help if the other guy was OP
---
I read somewhere there is not a lot of Xbox owners in Japan because it is a Sony stronghold or something. I would OP is on PS4 (or PC).
---
This is the same on Xbox for me, there's some who are garbage, but a lot more that are left now are worth fighting along side of

I do love me some wood chameleon armor.
---
And yeah the boss dropping one star legendaries is ridiculous since its a boss fight that is pretty crazy. I've had better luck killing the odd ball legendary enemies that spawn near my camp
---
これは私だけ向けの問題だと思った！      
---
やはり買いたいけれど出来てないのに何かバッグがあったと気がしました。日本全国に売ってないかしら？なんでか分かりたいなぁ
---
もし原因を把握すれば🇯🇵のプレーヤー達へ発表しましょう
---
You're hearing wrong I think, don't spread false rumors haha it just encourages those people
---
Don't. 76 is a great game but they recently introduced some pay-to-win items you can buy with Atoms after repeatedly saying they weren't.
---
I've been reading several posts about this. Is there a reason why? Security breech or something?
---
That might actually work
---
It does. Carnivore helped me a ton with hunger.
---
Yes it’s happening
---
I've had zero issues across several games. Including those on the maybe issues list.
---
I did that then someone let an eyebot approach my downed body and let it explode too bad im not carrying any junks so they thought I dropped something
---
Being a low level, I also believe we should be the ones doing pylons, even if it's just a little DPS, we lose DPS because a high level has to come running back to the fight after dying. A low-level has almost no DPS compared to a high-level. I usually run pylons and try to kill as much as I can. I'm lvl 27
---
Yeah this doesn’t make a lot of sense to me unless she’s got like a thousand+ armor or some hidden %damage reduction effects. I do 300 damage a bullet BEFORE adrenaline with my 50cal. 10 bullets is 3000 damage. 100 is 30,000. So a 250 box is 75,000 damage. If she’s only got 32k health and a “normal” amount of armor (300ish? I have no idea what it’s “supposed” to be) I alone should be able to kill her with a little over 1 reload, after her health regens.
---
And I usually have 60% buff from Adrenaline during queen fights, as it only takes a half second spray to pop adds as they arrive.
---
They do, but reading through other comments and the reddit thread below, points out that they can't redeem the codes.
---
Let me give your comment a thumbs up, seems like you had a rough childhood.
---
Have you ever played this game? Legendaries are already "trivialized", and 99% of them are absolute useless garbage. During the time it takes to call in a supply drop, I could go farm 10 legendaries at the Whitespring. 
---
Plus, it would be an incentive to actually do something related to PvP, being that opening someone else's supply drop gives you a bounty.
---
You can do it if you use a vpn.
---
I rename My items and as someone else pointed out to me in fo76filthycasuals  put a star in front of whatever you name it and it will filter it to the top
---
I hope they fix it I don't want it to keep happening and then get banned because their system was duping unintentionally

So sorry, I didn't read all of it just yet because you caught me at playing with your fiance, are you in the same house?
---
If so, do you have separate gold accounts? I'm trying to play with my  son (he bought me the game in beta) but we can't exist in the same server together.
---
We can play all we want at the same time, just not in the same world.
---
That's the part that pisses me off. I burn through all those stimpacks while completing the quest only to receive a damn 1* trash that isn't worth it's weight in scrap , much less worth trying to sell on the market sub. I would rather be rewarded with 20 stimpacks
---
I have this happen to me even on PS4. Usually when it does it, I cancel the wire activation and the start it again but reverse the order of attaching the objects. I don't know about PC but it works for me
---
M'ladydevann
---
I almost scrapped it countless times but cancelled out before doing it, then finally an error in attention in a fraction of a second, aaaaaaand it's gone.
---
In most games that put the jump on something else than A (on Xbox) I switch it back to A. Was the case with FO4 so I switch it in FO76 too.
---
Now the A button is used for something else in build mode and I feel weird each time i jump trying to connect a wire. So i support the idea, i think.
---
Guess I'm not in a hurry to get this done
---
Maybe 1000 caps then??  Idk. I just want a alternative version of getting atoms. I’m tired of doing ridiculous challenges all day.
---
I have assassins Sentinal which would theoretically add up to 115% damage reduction but still take damage, so you arent invincible if that's what you mean.
---
I dont believe you can learn dence I think it's only in mod form
---
Sony mentioned the name change could lead to save loss for some games. Something about games not being made with the right software to support the change.
---
I know that's simple but you already tried to change the language on your device? I don't know If can help but you should try...
---
The Fixer drops as a lv 30 weapon.  It seems this whole quest line was designed around mid level requirements, its not that hard to kill the assaultron but it does require a group that knows what to do.  3 to man pylons, more to go after the assaultron.
---
Yes! Lots of hangs and crashes!!
---
Haha, got me! *pew* *pew*
---
How are they spoiling it?
---
It’s literally a renamed, fully modded hunting rifle. Zero difference in stats. Just cheaper to craft
---
I checked out the new Whitesprings vendor hub. I don't like it. Seems kinda slapdash and not well thought out. They just crammed a new bot into whatever shop had room. Not even a stall or their own shop? Theres plenty of space in there, like, does the restaurant need THAT MANY empty tables?
---
Not that it matters when it’s only environmental quest shorter then an asma breath
---
If they do pay to win, it means they studied the market and know that it's going to make more money than satisfy a subreddit.
---
Adding a vital piece of info about the Sheepsquatch
---
God damn poor people are easy to upset.
---
I favorited a pipe pistol last night and tried this and I was not prompted, it was scrapped. Xbox.
---
They stack multiplicatively, not additively.
---
Same lol. Every time I mention I like and play this game I get a stink eye. every single time. that look of "oh, you must like bad games" It used to bother me but now, I just don't care. Stop looking at me and go play your apex kid.
---
HOLY CRAP! Bethesda, seriously. You PUT US THROUGH HELL with repair kits because you want to sell ATOMS. Sell this poor guy ATOMS. He had to translate into English he wants to give you money. Are you only selling Atoms in the US?
---
The real sheepsqautch mission unlocks after you kill the imposter and you kill 3 of them in a cave just like the deathclaws in the enclave bunker cave. Spoiler btw.
---
Theres a chance but I can tell you that a vpn was needed to activate the game itself if it was purchased from an amazon that wasn't the amazon of the region you were physically located in.

Your not the only one.
---
no, you can finally change your psn. you weren't able to before. so someone who made their psn back with ps3 might want to change it
---
Been an issue since beta, it's annoying, but bearable to me.
---
What does this have to do with the end of the questline being anti-climactic?   
---
Go be a dick somewhere else.
---
Like that's its fake? That's hardly a spoiler as the real ones are still ingame. All that tells people is that there is a fake one at some point.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
I know you wouldn't be invincible, but 115% is pretty much like 5 DMG taken from practically anything that doesn't deal rad DMG. Unless the math adds up to 75% reduction, then 25% less of what still is delt.
---
I (first) found that during patch 7. No idea how long it’d been there before that, I don’t visit that area much. No one knew what it was for when I asked about it then, either.
---
Active pylon , attack , kill mobs , cloack , active pylon no work around
---
It just a really rare plan though I do have it for leather only one I got in dense learned.
---
Sadly it's not the issue, since I was sure to check that all the correct perk-cards were equipped. I'm a bit "sick on the head" when it comes to these things, so I triple-check my load-out before I go anywhere. :/ I'm just hoping that it was my mistake and it's properly losing the durability.. Going to continue testing. Thanks!
---
Jesus man, you are what's RIGHT with this game! lol keep it up, this post had me laughing.
---
Must had been overcumbered while drying maybe ?
---
I personally get a ton of enjoyment out of it. The struggle of not having enough ammo, aid, or materials and not having endgame gear is more satisfying to me than running around one shotting everything.
---
I've started a few alts, trying to roleplay a bit, change up playstyles etc.
---
You might need a higher spec PC...
---
It’s definitely a bit of both for me, I love making alts and trying new builds but god does it get boring doing the same quest line over and over or farming in the same spot for hours
---
It deosn't work like that. It works like this (you have 20% damage reduction) 1000 damage becomes 800 damage, (you get another 20% DR) 800 becomes 640, (you get another 20%) 640 becomes 512, (you get another 20% DR) 512 becomes 409.6, (You get another 20% DR) 409.6 becomes 327.68. So on paper we have 5 20% DR items but it is not additive its on total after each piece is applied (kind of like discounts on store items)

Nice try fucking JET weeb but you're japanese is shit.

Well spoiler enough for me when all I've done is start the quest
---
Just hope an eyebomb doesn't kill you while you're downed and hope your allies have good weapons to kill it.
---
Most of the time I do that a random eyebomb blows near me and kills me
---
Nah. Rad damage isnt the only thing. Energy damage still does alot from any energy weapon, any shotgun with enforcer perk, any rifle with tank killer perk, railway rifles, bloodied weapons, plasma grenades, bleed damage, any heavy weapon with the staggering perk, and there are plenty more. People thinks its God mode but the amount of counters is insane. It only helps against just normal and explosove weapons really.
---
Now if we could just get an additional confirmation before selling to a vendor and dropping, I would be happy.
---
That happened to me with a stack of 100 stimpaks o sold to someone. But after a day, I logged back in and they finally disappeared for me.
---
My god I hope you are wrong. lol
---
Eh. Stinks man. At least no one has seen the real ones yet so that hasnt been spoiled.
---
I dont trust anyone in this game, been burned too many times now and its unfortunate but just the way it is. I wont accept random invites and I will be cautious now all the time.
---
It's the vault tec bombers jacket from the ATOM shop
---
Not at Aaronholt.
---
I didn’t know any of that. Damn.
---
Surely some geek out there can bypass this!
---
I have, and never will bought atom points but for some reason want this lovely young man to have whatever tat he wants from the store.
---
It's an issue because Bethesda has never done an online game that required servers like FO76. They're breaking new ground for themselves. They are learning.
---
I doubt they can just ring up another company and ask how they keep their servers so stable.
---
I thought player placed crops don't turn into flux?
---
I was on earlier.  What's your psn?
---
And for the love of....turn on passive. If ya die die quick and don’t call for help. It’s really a waste of stims to bring others back, just respawn and get back into it.
---
Their intention is for you to buy them with real money.
---
It should just show how formidable your teaching skills are when compared to your peers.
---
Seems like a scavy rather then a raider
---
Some things are definitely on a timer (though it can glitch I think).
---
I have a couple routes I take for farming, Whitespring is one, and when I loot all the stuff there I am after, server hopping doesn't help.
---
Certain world items (things you find lying around) and a lot of containers are time locked.  Lead weights and first aid boxes for instance.  Container inventories can change when you server hop *IF* you don't loot them.  Other containers seem to be simply random, though they may be locked as well but I just haven't noticed because the tend to be junk (trash cans for instance).
---
I haven't checked what the timer might be, but I can play quite a while before the items reappear.  They may be on the same 20 hour timer that the vendors are on, though it feels shorter to me.
---
I see. I may have to see if I can learn it
---
Bearsfan1113. I’ll be on in about 10 mins or so.
---
Ahhh the Colonel Gutsys. One of the few enemies in the game that can make an end-game player in full PA/max resists sweat.
---
Even at a high level(181) I use the syringer. It's awesome! That paired with my suppressors lmg I find it helps a lot in group setting. Not to mention the sbq
---
I typically leave goods in front of vendors or near stash boxes. That way I feel there is a better odd of someone seeing it. I never tried putting them in a container before.
---
Heads up
---
I used to be overburdened as well with junk chems and ammo
---
But this last patch has helped me keep my rolling gear weight down.
---
The biggest benefit is the vendor bots finally having cash to sell and go.
---
Just a suggestion
---
Looking up some Notes in Fallout 76 wikis and it states the ''next'' Note as Cut Content. Stuff that never made it into the game as finished content. Its in the gamefiles but not implemented. Maybe they forgot to get rid of it or they are going to add this now with the Burrows and stuff. Dunno xD
---
Actually - I can go on now. Booting up.
---
Sugar Grove has always seemed sketchy. Hell, at least I can get my battered clipboard, desk fan/globe fix. Maybe that's why all the good junk is there. Something is spying on me as I take all of the good stuff.
---
Afte reading alot of comments I still don't understan how this impacts gameplay. Yes it's something you can buy, does it give you an overall advantage over everyone else? No you are still gonna get wrecked in PVP by a TSE or Bloodied, will it benefit in PVE? Absolutely, let's put a scenario. You are in the middle of cranberry bog, just got done fighting a scorched beast, you inventory is full, your power armor is in pieces and your gun is almost at is end, you don't wanna drop any items because you just got the loot you needed, now if you had a repair kit you could just easily use it to fix the armo and continue, if not you'd have to huble back, hoping to atom you don't run into anything else that will wreck you.  
---
I feel like this is just outrage to be outraged, no one is holding a knife saying you must buy repair kits or you must buy atom shops, you will be able to get advance kits from events so there is really no need to spend atoms unless you want to have some at hand.
---
Maybe it feel like it, but at the same time it's not too hard to kinda farm purified water to sell or even stims and radaway.
---
But also, more charisma and some perks in that category can help, although I find myself have too much things to sell so I don't use it, and yet i'm sure i'll hit the cap limit soon.
---
We can only have 25k caps i think.
---
We had to go up a hill both ways with only dirty water and diluted radaway.
---
Upvoting because my corpse got looted before I could get to respawn
---
Maybe will be used in the future and has some relation with the Seepsquatch/Cryptid search?
---
They removed a lot of marked (and interesting) locations from the first map: the crashed Space Station, the Vault with no texture (that now has and it's 51), West-Tek...
---
There's a lot of content that we haven't seen yet.
---
I used to love that show.

Why are you coming to a subreddit for a game that contains new content that would (and has) upset you if it was spoiled?
---
I’ve made plenty of alts and never have I been given free materials, loot or tips
---
C'mon. you read the road map but not the inside the vaults?
---
So you're one of the reasons my camp won't always spawn in....
---

No, they probably won't do it because they promised cosmetics only. Obviously Beth was thinking with the wrong head...

Me too, but otherwise it will become way too easy. Garbage legendaries are so easy to get.

XBOX
---
1) Nearly 50 percent of my shots miss or do 0 damage in vats, regardless of weapon.  (even with Critical shots and 95%)
---
2) I'm still finding many permanently invisible players that are invisible and moving and shooting, and it persists after death. It's only gotten worse with this update.
---
3) Players that shoot you when wanted still do not appear as enemies and allow VATS to work. Unsure if this is intended, as it handicaps wanted players to the max.
---
4) Load screens are still exceptionally long for survival. Loading in usually results in the invulnerable period expiring and death by other players.
---
5) Melee is not registering in 1st person. Better in 3rd or vats, but still bad.
---
6) Console aim assist seems to favor the left foot, instead of center mass. I wish we could disable it.
---
7) The Vim! power armor paint disappears upon learning the plan. (tried to learn it in January. Still no effect)
---
8) Bird Bones + Strange in Numbers results in inconsistent falling patterns. The player can achieve transcendence and fly for varying periods.
---
9) Rendering seems to cut out at 50 meters. Beyond that is unloaded rubbish.
---
Everything I found in the 3 hours I played after patch.
---
For me the toxicity was not against the game, but the fact that it’s short comings were entirely unnecessary and totally avoidable. I’m not angry because I hate Anthem, I’m angry because I want to love it. But after narrowly missing the bullet on Andromeda ( an Amazon Prime issue caused my pre-order to not happen, which I was happy for once I heard what my friends had to say about their experiences ) I had already lowered my bar for Anthem, but was still hopeful.
---
Yet still they managed to disappoint. Calling what they released a Beta was being too generous, and there is no way a game in that state should have been released. And this is after not only their own shit storm with Andromeda, but after they had just witnessed the tire fire that was the 76 launch.
---
But where 76 has been nothing but a stream of patches, communication, QoL improvements and continuous content, Anthem has continued stumble and provide little to it’s community.
---
I keep watching hoping to see signs of improvement that will bring me back to wanting it, but as of now, well after launch, I still can’t say I’m even close to wanting it.
---
It looks like this is one image that has been chopped up and scrambled.  [I started piecing some of it together](https://imgur.com/qyEUcoC) in photoshop but it's kind of a pain, especially because the texture is warped from the terminal. If someone could find this texture in the game files, I think it would help clear things up a lot. I really want to know what this is now.
---
I don’t have the paper but I do have all the launch codes, here they are 
---
Silo Alpha	Silo Bravo	Silo Charlie
---
84138947	67623748	51239897
---
Yeah, agreed
---
Based on the survival beta rewards, and the sheepsquatch imposter loot, Bethesda has absolutely no fucking idea what players in the endgame are looking for, or what endgame gear even is.
---
I got 3
---
A - tse lever
---
Ab - tse handmade 
---
Abbomstick - quad double barrel ( explosive rounds )
---
Giving this names to my 3 main weapons allows me to have them in top of my list if sorted in alphabetical order or by damages depending on the situation ( got some bloodied weapons on me )
---
Little story I have over 700 lbs worth of weapons on my  character so this is the easiest way to have at hand what I always use 5 points on demo expert and 2 on granadier
---
Silo Alpha

Have a much deserved upvote for spreading the good word!
---
Yeah, but that where bullshit rng comes into play. There are way too many ways for the game to screw us

Or at least make them interesting. A nukashine stringer would need be legendary.

Hello, I’m having the exact same problems as mentioned.

With 3 conduits debuff, it's pretty much instant death. I ussusly get at least 2 on me and hold it while I bleed out.

That's why it's called a support position, it's what sniper builds like mine specialize in. Rooftops are my natural habitat; I kill or significantly damage around 2/3 of the mobs (estimate based on how many are lootable for me afterward). Pacifist always on, of course, so my grenades don't hurt our friends on the ground. I've sniped a good number of robots that were going for people's backs when they were busy chasing that damnable sheep. I can easily take care of a pylon, up there, too (without dying once, because nothing else is hitting or even seeing me. Long live Born Survivor + Auto Stim armor). I pull my weight.
---
As for not knowing the sheepsquatch's specific damage mechanics, I don't really care as long as I know I'm contributing.
---
/me blows through 1000 rounds of 5.56, gets a hat
---
That VATS crit tho
---
Care to elaborate?
---
This guy has a valid complaint about this specific RNG change.  Not long ago, one could get more than enough high radiation fluids from a Whitesprings nuke.  Within the last handful of "balance" nerfs, I'd consider myself lucky to get even one.
---
Maybe they changed the loot tables for this based on location?  I'd love to know where I can nuke to specifically farm high radiation fluids... among other things.
---
Same here
---
HAHAHHA I got a legendary marine armor piece....that I threw on the ground immediately IDK I guess I'll wait for the seller thing to get a explosive weapon, I just don't get how people get them I killed the queen 100+ times still crap weapns, I have legendarys by the truck load but still use a fireaxe with spikes...because it's better then anything else I own...I just don't get how people get those good weapns....
---
spoiler tags please ffs
---
Exactly!
---
It became pointless, for me anyway. There's so many 3* items that are pointless now that a 1* better be a heckin goodun
---
There is a hotfix coming in an hour I'll see if I still have it after that. 
---
If it is I'll have a couple of God roll rifles to trade
---
800 works.  Make sure you don’t have any unscrapped junk.  Drop missiles, mininukes, harpoons, drop extra plans, spoiled foods
---
I mean..... true but a man can dream, that is unless his name is MLK Jr.
---
I actually had the game freeze on me when i was in my inventory, this the the first time that has happened, all the other times it has froze at loading screens, server disconnects, and crash to system
---
so, this is bad, the game is creating new ways to fuck up
---
My Favourite ones so far are:
---
Furious Grognaxe: Aspirin. Mainly because it gets rid of your head...ache
---
TSE Gatling: Euthanasia
---
Explosive Single Action: The Equaliser
---
TSE Pipe Rifle: Pipe Down
---
Three kills and one legendary (\*\*)
---
Really exited and interested in doing the event over and over. Good job BGS.
---
Honestly, satisfied customers offer more money than trying to rip them of their last pennies. Also, I highly doubt that bethesda studies the market whatsover or they would have noticed that releasing a broken game will not result in a lot of money.
---
Truly a travesty
---
Are we talking archetypes in roleplaying? Because I think that limits the dimensionality of a character. 
---
A raider can be a scavenger and vice versa. It’s not like a bomb drops and we all turn into superheroes or super villains, there’s grey area’s.
---
Holy shit - I logged back in last night and boom my camp was back? Glad i didnt move it lol.
---
If you're shooting at the sheepsquatch while cloaked you're not contributing/wasting your ammo and condition. You are when you shoot the mobs though
---
And if they're worried about people 'abusing' it (they don't seem to like it when things become less of a grind), they could always limit the number of the rare plants - like allow us to have 1 of each of stuff like fever blossoms and the like. Even that would be awesome.
---
I started noticing that after the update. I find that if I go in and out of the trading menu a couple of times it corrects itself.
---
But to the OP's point, a couple of the other unique quest reward weapons and armour can be upgraded to new levels. So the precedent and code is there somewhere. At least allow all of the unique quest reward weapons/armour to be upgraded. Would be really nice to be able to upgrade the sledge from Watoga, Perfect Storm, and others.
---
Hell I'd love to be able to gift atoms or items from the atom shop!

---
I'll keep up my bloodied melee, so hard to move away from it. Very few enemies last more than 1 swing. I do have a bloodied explosive handmade iv been playing with recently though.
---
I love a lot of the changes with the update, but I am now experiencing multiple server crashes each session.  Boo.
---
I hadn't seen these crashes (in this frequency) for several months.
---
I'm on the PS4.  This happens to me in both Adventure and Survival mode.  
---
I WAS working on my Lowe questline...does that have something to do with it?
---
Its either make it less grindy or let it be an unused waste if the dev's time and budget.
---
Yeah, its like a raid boss dropping a green, blue or epic item at random in WoW.  Very few people would raid.
---
Well apparently people are exploiting a way to go into an event without actually taking part in it, allowing them to stay hostile to everyone else in the event.
---
They also broke spin up weapons in the process. They fire a single shot then stop firing until spun up again. They also randomly consume the remaining ammo in their magazine/core, wasting large amounts of ammo. So this fix just caused new issues.
---
Ah! Okay, nice, I thought there was something I was doing wrong! Thanks
---
You know what I feel would be a good balance to that is if there was only certain crops you could grow in certain areas depending on the biome.
---
IIRC there is a crashed truck by one of the ponds full of cranberries (not diseased cranberries) in the Bog. I'm pretty sure there was a mention of that same terminal of what the ingredient was, I can tell you if you want?
---
Did it three times last night, all failed. At one time we were able to bring her health down to maybe 10 percent, but then she became invisible and when the pylon was active again, her health was full. So does she always regen back to full health when the pylon is down?
---
Both for sure. I have a melee guy and a sniper guy. Actually playing the game felt different, the play styles are day and night when it comes to comparison. However, the main quests are so fucking boring IMO that it felt tedious to complete them. I spent most of my time jumping from event to event. It is also a great reminder that this game is dogshit until about level 40 unless you stay in the forest. I hate that as a level 20 you can run into a level 62 deathclaw, get mauled, and have to take the L on your junk. At that level that can be devastating and really set you back.
---
If Bethesda start selling Legendary vendor tokens they will really piss off everyone. I will definitely send them a strongly worded letter.
---
*your

When I'm doing code reviews I'm allowed to make additional aesthetic changes if I notice them. Spelling mistakes in comments, things like that. Someone finally noticed it and was like "well I'll just fix that."
---
Despite being listed as fixed here, the favorites wheel is still broken when having two of the same type of weapon favorited. Upon logging off and on it removes one and moves the location of the other one like it always has.
---
/u/ladydevann please pass this along.
---
Yup can agree you only kept what you needed
---
Unfortunately, that's simply not true. The "whales" are a small minority, but they spend more than your casual player. They might be a small percentage of the playerbase, but they are a majority of the income
---
Or the mods do their fucking jobs. The brag about how good they are at it and how hard it is.
---
It can’t be either if they aren’t even doing it.
---
It doesn't have anything to do with financial well being. Nobody like pay to win it takes all the fun away.
---
The Silva homesteads on the west side of the map is a prime example you nuke this site you will get plenty of raw materials.
---
Nuke a site with high volume of enemies you will get not much raw flux but you will get the stabilizers , hardened mass , high radiation fluid etc ..
---
I thought about that and I kind of like it but at the same time then you would only be able to make like 2 extra recipes depending on where you live. The point is to get all this cool "survival" style ruffing it and living off the land content that's already there to be more accessible.
---
I’d say the actual notes get in the way of plans, recipes, and maps. But holo is just holotapes.
---
So I’m not the only one that collects the teddy bears.
---
.......ark, rust, PUBG, and literally every other Early Access dumpster fire that has made tons of money would like a word with you.
---
Shit Ark is still a broken piece of shit and yet they managed to release, and sell, DLC, IN EARLY ACCESS. 
---
Just because you're salty (and rightly so) about MTX doesn't mean everyone else is, or even cares.
---
If i were you i would get a support ticket idk if you can do that in japan but try
---
I am going to hit that tonight.
---
Thank you.  :)
---
The sad thing is that PA is pointless in PvP, because PvP is all about legendary bonuses, and PA (and scout armor aswell btw) dont have any legendary versions.  
---
I'm holding out hope somewhere that they'll make some changes that might make PA a viable alternative, but I doubt it sadly.
---
That's always been fallout gaming, personally I don't have an alt to have different builds to play, I'm like you, I don't want to redo all that.
---
I've been working a build until I'm not interested anymore then trying a new one one but all on my original toon. After time the available perk cards elft get to be unnecessary, I save perk points then adjust my specials. Maybe 4-5 adjustments are necessary to go from shotgun to rifle, rifle to bloodied, etc. Again, over time you'll have enough cards to just switch a bit and ur good!

The details from the post are as follows:
---
There is now a new bug where using a Gatling Laser/Plasma immediately after a reload or after switching weapons (on occasion) where it now fires one round, or no rounds, then stops. You must release the trigger, spin up the barrel and fire a second time for the weapon to function correctly.
---
Exact steps to replicate: Reload gatling, press to fire. Gun will stop firing. Release fire, press to fire again, gun will fire until release. Reload gatling, press to fire, issue occurs immediately after reload. 
---
Video Confirmation of the Bug: https://youtu.be/1ElR9Mhq1kw
---
Yeah, that's what I've said a couple times... I chuck some explosives in its general direction (which also helps with the mobs that have clustered in that area) and then go back to shooting Gutsies. That thing is nearly impossible to VATS from up there anyway because there are so many other mobs in the way.
---
It's a Bethesda title. CTDs will always be a thing. Not defending it, I'm just saying that there isnt a single Bethesda title that doesn't have CTDs so this one probably wont be any different.
---
I did it twice yesterday with randoms and it wasn't even hard to finish. The first time there were only 2 of us at the start(I activated 2 pylons) and we didn't get anyone else to show up for several minutes. Still finished it with time to spare. Idk how people are struggling.
---
It would only be as easy as they want to make it.  If it simply mirrored the inventory of the local vendor, what's the problem?  The odds of getting a relevant mod from the existing vendors are already exorbitantly low.
---
I have 487 to call in. Would be interesting, to say the least.
---
Idk I’ve seen groups of raiders those would not allow anybody from their group to partake on anything.
---
Set traps on events , steal people’s stuff even if their lowbies.
---
Then you get the scrounger or scavenger ( like most of us) waiting to see a piece of action fall to go and get it lol idk dude I’ve picked a few baggies unintentionally then I dropped some too, learned the lesson , always have spoiled goods on you for the undesirables not even they will pick my mole rat meat
---
Strong agree.
---
I have a post and ticket written up on this bug. Show some love and upvote so it is hopefully seen soon?
---
Yeah sure and Bethesda should even hire you because you know so much about business!
---
Game freezes repeatedly for me, in literally everywhere. I’ve contacted with the support and last patch has probably something to do with all these. Freezing is completely random and can happen anytime, and can last between 5 seconds to a minute. Here is [this](https://youtu.be/LifU8ZbCW7U) and [that](https://youtu.be/L-AByRgnH04)  for example.
---
Sorry you feel that way. Don't know if you didn't read my comment before the one i replied to but yeah i haven't played anthem or any of the other games so i can't comment on that, can't we at least stick to talking about 76 since we are all here on r/fo76?
---
Do the other games have the same people working on it as in fallout 76?
---
Definitely. If I need a three star item that all three features are what I’m looking for, the odds for the right combination is probably lower than one in a million.
---
Zealot Ski Sword - Fastest Wacker Around
---
Silent quad exploding combat shotgun - Silent, as well as deadly. 
---
Executioner Handmade rifle - Finishing Strong
---
Unyielding Marine Armor piece - Why. Won't. You. Die?!?!
---
Where's the spoiler? I'm only talking about a safe that nobody knows where's the key and a map that you can see in a trailer.
---
Nice, hadn't noticed this yet! Wonder if it applies to Gatling plasma, too? Yo /u/tiptherat
---
It's all about perspective, playing from launch, 400 was quite limiting, but I learned I didn't need 300+ of every material and started bulking and selling. 
---
Then they increased it to 600, currently I never go past 550 because I sort through the junk I have excess of, bulk and sell. 
---
Now it's 800, last night I logged out at 550/800. Basically, I like having that massive buffer - I don't have insane luck with legendaries so that space is still unused, here's to being hopeful! =P
---
Are you actually dumb? Its legendary 3* it will regenerate it lost heath once. It has nothing to do with the pylons. It's all rng based how about you do some research before hand
---
The enclave vendor is the only one you have to complete a quest to unlock so I doubt we will ever see an enclave vendor inside the resort for that reason.
---
As I said, even if chip damage exists it’s too small to be relevant. If players try to use chip damage, the event will fail.
---
Weapon damage https://imgur.com/a/1yQ5DZd
---
So I experimented today as I have the same issue. I have noticed and the same thing happens with my friend.. how much health we have is effecting non bloodied weapons. So our explosive weapons are going up and down depending on our health.
---
Pics above should show the issues we have experienced
---
Yeah usually what I do , and I play solo and with randoms mostly it’s nuke idk Morgantown or the whitesprings to gather all those materials.
---
Then on the second time I will decide what I need crimson , cobalt ( because yellowcake is everywhere ) and equip green thumb and good with salt and off we go to stabilize at least 10 units of each good luck
---
Yes the unique legendaries from doing quests are the ones that hurt the most, for that reason on my 2nd character I didn't do any of those great quests till after level 50, which was a shame, a way around that would be very nice
---
False statement. Imposter is invulnerable to any form of attacks when cloaked.
---
Player crops do not turn into flux if nuked.
---
Lol stalking ass, still mad cause I Sonned you earlier. Get off my dick boiii
---
Not being able to spend your cash on optional in-game currency is depressing you?  
---
I really don't understand this reaction or choice of words. Pretty sure praying will not help.  
---
My honest reaction is to contact Bethesda Game Studios directly and see what they say, maybe it will be possible sooner rather than later.
---
Right but players read that and think "at least I'm doing chip damage :I"
---
No It is impossible by VPN.
---
Someone nuked the fissure site at Lake Eloise. There were exactly four enemies when I went to check it out, three ticks and a supermutant. All but one dropped multiple mats including two high radiation fluids on one. So... I dunno. Burn some sage?
---
Sort by weight
---
Why should you not log off? You are given the choice to defend yourself in an apocalyptic wasteland or run, so you can choose to run simple as that. You still have choice and that's what this is about for you right consent? Not that that matters because there will always be somone complaining that the line hasn't been drawn far enough. It literally makes no sense that other players can't impact you at all it defeats the purpose of free will in an open world game like this. It boggles my mind how you you know that this is true and you still think its ok to impede people, despite the fact you have options to log off / move your camp.  YOU ARE NOT BEING FORCED IN TO ANYTHING LOG OFF. but then you say oh logging off isn't a good enough solution - this is my point you will always have something to complain about even when there is a solution to your problem and you won't stop until you've ruined this game. I'll be highly suprised if bethesda changes camps because 1: indestructable camps can be used as a griefing tool, trapping people. 2. It defeats the purpose of the wanted system they created. But who knows maybe if you cry loud enough they will listen! Good luck ruining this game - because if you get want you want you defeat the purpose of a fallout and survival game.
---
Settle down beavis, I’ve done many sbq killings. This ISS regen back to full hp every time she became visible, that’s why I was asking.
---
Yeah well todd also said a bunch of shit about this game that wasn't true. Meanwhile the people actually making it have said otherwise.
---
They sometime spawn at Treehouse Village &amp; Dolly Sods Campground
---
They don't, they get destroyed like any other camp object in a blast zone.
---
Yes this so much the game keeps freezing up during sbq fights
---
This, how would they sell stuff?
---
Yes i should have.
---
I burned so many stempacks during this event and all i got was a stupid 1* wood armor. WTF!
---
Patch bug , happening in consoles as well.
---
A loose mod ( yellow box ) can’t be attach to weapons nor amor.
---
I attempted to build a mod from scrap and that seemed to work, this is what you might be referring to
---
Rng man
---
yeah, they have increased hunger/thirst as i think the upcoming fridges will be for sale soon, to increase motivation for player to buy ATOMS
---
Used a new alt for when survival launched, it was a lot of fun using a different build and play style while having to be very paranoid about other players. It also let me experience the main quest properly, where as in my main file I skipped everything past the firebreathers and went straight to the Enclave. Didn't hurt to get like 15 levels during the double XP weekend.
---
Interesting idea, I feel like heavy guns use a lot of AP, and you get less AP than in normal armor (no Unyielding or Ultralight armor). 
---
Also, you can’t stack more than one alcohol at once. Basically one food, one alcohol, one chem.
---
Well now it takes more time. If they were most all together, you could go though several much much faster. And cheaper.
---
Also what mods do you think are low chance? Many of them are quite common.
---
Ya end game content requires end game resources. Seems fair to me
---
Tip: put a dash (-) at the front of your power armor so it sorts to top of your armor list.
---
I got ambushed by like 4 of those...somewhere in the Mire.  I think I was near that gaping maw hole in the ground...very creepy and at the bottom was an angry angler lol
---
It has a 3 hour cooldown. I think they should make it clearer how long until it is possible to start the event again. Maybe even displaying it on the computer.
---
A shame it is only for one armour though. PA skins should be for ALL PA models.
---
riiiight, like i need to eat 12 brahmin steaks just to "not" be hungry?
---
my character should be severely obese by now or dead from diabetes
---
If you’re on ps I can put the card if not just change server until you find the event if is too expensive to get the card
---
This should be marked as a spoiler ffs.
---
Theres one that circles the ground level of tangra town
---
I want to crucify RNGesus and sacrifice him to the pagan saint Lootcifer
---
That depends on you. If you just make more of the same, I would imagine is does get boring after a while.
---
Do something different: Only use pistols or energy weapons or pipe weapons, never use power armor, always take drugs and booze or never use drugs. 
---
Shake up your gameplay and do something different than before.
---
man you choose some weird hills to stand on
---
I PvP on survival only, I never initiate PvP on adventure...
---
Except when I join adventure to do some trades and see a player with 10 cap bounty. I FT nearby, Do the hello emote, do the finger-gun emote,  and finish it up with the ??.
---
They usually give me a thumbs up and are mercifully put out of their unfortunate status. I leave the bag untouched and disappear in the woods.
---
People please do that.
---
Ark, Rust, PUBG and literally every other Early Access dumpster fire were, as you said, early access and made by a new and/or inexperienced developer team. Also, these games did cost like 30 bucks.
---
Fallout76 was sold as a FINISHED product by a TRIPLE-A developer for FULL 60 BUCKS.
---
If they had sold Fallout76 as early access for 30bucks, I wouldn't even be that mad about it tbh.
---
I wonder if the plan for the Missile Launcher is still the Missle Launcher. Asking the real questions here.
---
I've never hadto back out of build mode. Just back out of the place item your own and then try again. It is supper annoying though.
---
If you guys and gals check out a YouTuber named juicehead in one of his recent videos he found the legit sheepsquatch in game, hope this helps
---
At least if the flux goes inert, you can drink it, and it weighs less than purified water (albeit, without the HP bump) :)
---
I think its RNG.  Pre-patch 8, If the corpses had them, then whomever killed it didnt take it.  So the verbiage goes, post patcxh 8, if you tag it, and RNG drops it, you get some.
---
Subjectively, 4 runs ago, hardened/glowing mass and HRF were non-existent.  3 runs ago, got 10 or so, 2 runs ago, only got 4 or 5.  
---
Last run, got at least 10.
---
The level up 3 times thins stack. So if one is wearing a mask, one is in watoga, and one is over level 50, you can be over level 50 in watoga wearing a mask and complete it in one level up.
---
I'm always dropping goodies at Watoga when I go. I like going there for the 2 close vendors to check on plans for sale and consider buying brotherhood power armor mods and plans.
---
True. But it is a perfectly savage weapon to use in Survival.
---
Explosive legendary cannot be on explosive weapons. Also, explosive cannot be on energy weapons except for past weapons.
---
I don't think so. I think the client/engine is unable to change the Max HP after a mob spawned so the server has to scale down the remaining health to the initial 32k range. For example, she has 64k on the server, you deal 1k effective damage, the server has now 63k health and the client is updated with only 500 health loss. If possible, you could team up with someone and duo her on an empty server to see how much damage you dealt and what the server said about it.
---
Huh. I'd completely forgotten that Swing on a Star was in the game at all. I love that song, too.
---
&gt;oldown for you triggering it.
---
Nuke silos do have a cooldown, but there's 3 silos on a server so 3 hours for one event is way too much.
---
I got one off some dude called:
---
‘X il pRo SkIlLz’
---
Might be worth asking him.
---
Nice one :)
---
shit dude was that before or after you sold that TSE Lever? I was the guy you sold it to last night, I'm just curious on the timeframe. After you sold it to me, I did a lot of trading with a friend and now have a need to check to see if my inventory is ok.
---
Same thing happened to me, it's called the Recall Assaultron circuit board. Some of the whitesprings vendors have it in their MISC section for right around 2000 caps. When you successfully start the event it will get rid of your keycard. Players can make another keycard at a tinkers workbench, but one of the components is the circuit board. Effectively the event costs a couple thousand caps to start.
---
Link to any of this? I haven't seen anything about it from the devs.
---
Thought so, otherwise we all would be full-time farmers.
---
Not as bad as I thought, then. Still seems like a pain. I'm sure I've been levelling up more slowly recently.
---
Received two of those in about 6 wins last night
---
"It just works" moment. Or more "it's a feature not a bug"
---
You got that right 😂
---
You will have received one of each at the end of the portion where you read the terminal at garrahan estate. Did you not look open the trunk of the car next to that terminal?
---
Ok, while I found it pretty easy to get the gist of it withing a couple of minutes. What I'm still fuzzy on (and perhaps it was the drinks clouding my brain last night), is the cards. . . Do they get used upon event entry? if you activate a pylon? Because I had 3 upon entering the even my only and 1st time, and after the failed even it seemed they were all gone. I did activate a pylon 2-3 times. I can think of no other way they would have been used seeing as how I only entered the event once, but had multiple cards. Anyone have the stone cold clarification on these, and how they are expended?
---
It is?????
---
you could add "Ze" infront of their names
---
like "Ze T60 Power Armor" or "Ze Excavator"
---
$50 on that bidding site..
---
touche
---
Not fan of assaultrons. Much more fluid and responsive the col. gutsy 
---
You can kite/ping them from afar, assaultrons can get  up close and personal
---
Special Characters work, at least brackets anyways. Like I put [X-01] before that chassis and it's at the bottom.
---
So i'm not the only one going mad with this lol
---
Whitesprings mirror embeds itself into both sides of brick walls, cannot be retrieved unless wall is switched to a doorway.
---
However, in the same camp build, it can be hung on a metal wall with no issues.
---
That’s my goal now. To get the keg
---
Got the always classic Ghoul Slayer Gamma Gun. It had a 2nd star so I'll save it for legendary scrapping.
---
Grognaks axe can't be over repaired to 200% only 100%
---
Jesus Christ, YOUR japanese is so fucking cringy dude.
---
But yeah, try to look cool on a sub where nobody can read you.
---
they already are
---
Combining Area of effect and ensuring splash damage from multiple sources was the primary reason for even deigning to mention the combo as a super gold. Area of effect for free is already very strong, but when you increase that in any way with a damage boost- that is certainly worthy of mention.
---
The only other real supergolds I might consider on the right weapon is Furious + 25% Attack Speed.
---
But I am open to suggestions.
---
Also a radx one for shutting down a players mutations while your at it.
---
I blame Vault Tec....... I always blame Vault Tec lol, what I thought was interesting though was Calvin was set to go to Vault Tec University if he had lived so if what happened hadn’t happened  Calvin would have ended up as a Vault Overseer 🤔
---
Is this also going to apply to dense armor plans? Please say it will! You and I have spoken about this before so I'm hoping it's on your radar.
---
Oh that’s smart, the picture also fades in and gets brighter causing some of the squares to white out and some to come into clarity differently
---
Its the Flatwoods monster? But its possible that we might be getting a Zetan DLC
---
I think because people typically double tap a to scrap something so in order to confirm a scrap you need to change buttons, actually very good idea I think.
---
I can but I'm currently at work. If you havent found anyone befor I get home I can mod you a set
---
Same, I’m in
---
I'll gladly do it. Won't be on for a few more hours tho. PSN thekikibee
---
I'd like one please I'll also provide the mats
---
Huh. It's like they announced a server stability and game patch for today. *yesterday*
---
Oh, I like this one, thanks!
---
This woild also be acceptable
---
Have been running it with vampiric weapons (various gatlings), really helps to mitigate the damage from being a conduit
---
We play in the same house, I am PC, so she uses the laptop and I use my desktop (or the other way around if we want).
---
It's for unique plans and cosmetics. Not for legendary weapons.
---
Luckily for me I'm a huge explorer, when I start any fallout game I usually spend so much time exploring all locations and gathering stuff that I ignore most quests so by the time I get to the quests I'm a higher level which has it's pros and cons in itself. Most quests are much much simpler when you're a higher level then they expect you to be, but like this post is for, I do get the quest items in a higher level too. Plus you can do quests easier when you know the locations and you can fast travel to them.
---
You can have both?
---
Always starch your jeans. I guess that’s better than getting empath I suppose.
---
Unique legendary for events yes, but allowing perks from the same class, such as sentinel + assassin, is the dumbest idea in this game, they are way OP, mess up the balance and easily duped and exploited. When everyone’s uncle is sporting a bloodied two-shot anti-armor three star bazooka it’s time to play something else.
---
True every one deserves to get those new PA skins
---
I suggest trying a high agility/luck Unyeilding build. It's essentially a glass cannon build, but you don't really need a lot of health when enemies can't detect you. There are many perks that synergize well with the build, and the high stats gives you many advantages. It's the Fonzie build of the fallout universe.
---
Ah the favorite role, the useless kind I see
---
How useful would reactive plates,  blocker and meds be at trying to tank the imposter once it’s vulnerable.  Even at lvl114 in power armor it still hits like a truck!
---
Where has anyone said anything else about the purveyor?
---
I've seen a few people mention sorting things has been off this patch, so it's possible they may change it in the future and suddenly [] would put things at the beginning, but yeah, at least for now it's great.
---
I have no reason to change my PSN ID, pretty happy with it, but now players can change it, some are still complaining, FFS it's free for the first time and costs after that, but you can revert to the original, for free.  
---
Maybe more players need to think about how their ID will be interpreted rather than whatever sounds "cool" at the time, shocker not everyone has the same mindset or mentality as you.
---
どうぞ、日本語してください
---
貴女と他の英語しか分からない人ではなく、*OP*に書いたよ。
---
Thank you that’s what I needed! Way clearer. If you go a frame earlier and a frame later do some of the squares seem to change for you?
---
Well how most games do it is where you can either buy something to make the process of getting something faster and make it slower and actually work for to get that item. Challenges are annoying to do sometimes and some are nearly impossible to do.
---
Ha, silly, but funny, but yea, still starts with Z :(
---
Eh I think the rule #2 is pretty clear
---
It's just boring. I don't even bother checking the map anymore. I already know the nuke zone is going to be far away from me. One time it was actually in The Forest.... During the BETA. that's it. That's the only time I haven't seen Whitesprings or Cranberry Bog get nuked.
---
It says it’s a different challenge. Since I don’t think the alien was in the list prior to the update we might see it on the 16th with the new underground areas
---
This might not be a PC spec problem. I have fairly high end PC and still got random freezes and crashes.
---
thanks i will
---
Why lol. It's been increased TWICE.
---
What the fuck are you hoarding that you need more space? 
---
Learn to manage your inventory ffs.
---
I haven’t checked if it’s been fixed for this patch yet, but Save Everything prevented accidental dropping/selling/scraping of favorited and equipped items. It ALSO gave you a numeric entry box for setting values in selling/trading.
---
Mods are glitched since Tuesdays update. I can't add a mod to my rifles too
---
Did you read my post?! I specifically said I wanted not to be spoiled on things in patch 8!
---
I got Perfect Storm at level 50, so mine is level 50. It's in my stash, as it's not a particularly great weapon for most things (decent for ghouls and scorched (not beasts)) but that's about it.
---
Fact is random legendaries with good modifiers outclass all quest reward gear, so the hunt for good legendaries would still be necessary. Yes All Rise does great damage, but a hammer with armor piercing and faster swing speed will outclass it completely. 
---
It's a good idea to allow quest rewards to scale up. Those are unique items you should want to keep forever, and what level you get them at shouldnt limit them, otherwise it incentivizes not doing any quests until you are level 45 or 50.
---
Allowing this also makes legendaries you get from certain monsters that don't scale to level 50 potentially useful. Take Mole Miners during the Uranium Fever Event, for example. Those only go to level 40, so the legendaries they drop and event itself are less valuable than they could be, being level 35 or 40. 
---
All said and done, allowing upgrading at a junk cost makes the legendary hunt more enjoyable, and certainly not obsolete.
---
But ur not a duper so...😂
---
Honestly can’t think of a proper reason.  Seems like a knee jerk-slap dash implementation to me.
---
I thought it got fixed so that killing the Flatwoods Monster counted as killing an Alien? Maybe I read it wrong.
---
For me, it seems to depend on where I’m at. East side of the map seems fine but get into the new event areas and it starts stalling, disconnecting and just plan ol crash.
---
Lol
---
   Damn, is this game telling me I’m a fat ass and need to go on a diet??
---
you can grow gourds
---
Actually the Flatwoods Monster is and alien so I don't know what happening. But the new underground area might have something to do with the Scorch beast experiments.
---
Bah, I'm Xbox. Do u have separate gold accounts?
---
Where does it say patch 8? I must be blind or something....
---
Imagine if I had to live without a neon pink wiffle bat, you can’t can you? Truly depressing!!!!
---
It's in the patch notes guys. Yes both energy gatlings were "fixed".
---
Use alt characters
---
I agree sir. I also think it's silly that paint only applies to one gun. If you buy can no paint you should be able to paint everything
---
It's in the patch notes.
---
Looks like a clock in it maybe try this [another guy got a better screen shot now](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/PxT18HV)
---
Would be nice if we could have *full* keybind control.
---
I wish we could get a CAMP and inventory interface that was just functionally designed for the PC- keyword searching, more context to the buttons, less overlap of inputs.
---
Nice!
---
I've seen 1. Been playing since Beta.
---
Thanks dude, appreciate it.  
---
Sure I'll add you on PSN, and if I see you log on we can hook up.  
---
I usually be on 7pm to 9pm most evenings (UK time)
---
Yu mad?
---
Chances are due to changes in Japan's currency laws atom will never be sold there. It ended up getting caught up in a new law aimed cryptocurrencies.
---
You cant have both Cannibal and Herbivore at the same time. Why would you starch your jeans? as opposed to your genes?
---
Stopped playing last night because portions of the HUD became black squares. It would go away for a bit then flicker back. Eventually the whole screen went black only showing me the HUD but I could still open the map and my pip boy.
---
Selling mutation serums
---
The ridiculous ones.
---
Kill a glowing enemy while at rad storm 10 atoms
---
Kill 5 ants while drinking ant lager 20 atoms these don’t spawn for some reason anywhere of the usual spots.
---
In short , missing out 20 atoms daily’s since release because of unfair ones or ones that didn’t work like the flowers
---
I boil all my denim
---
You’re a little bit off by missing a zero at the end? 32k translates to 200 shots of primed 50 cal, does it sound real to you?
---
Mmm true and if you think repair kits are p2w you have some very serious intellect issues
---
Like how Fallout 3 did it. It was very nice to have that.
---
Also it would grey out the item in the list after you read or listened to a specific item.
---
Quad on weapons that require more than their basic magazines turns unviable weapons into infinitely powerful combinations. TSE harpoon? Strong blue? QE harpoon? Supergold.
---
Double barrel shotgun TSE? Blue. QE db shotgun? Super gold.
---
PvP weapons are put against fireproof and dense, I agree, but that reduces most of them to blue, leaving only selected few in gold.
---
TSE handmade? Gold. BloodiedVatsCrit? Supergold.
---
TSE Tesla is a nice rifle, but furious 1* is vastly better when it comes to killing an enemy that is hidden behind doors waiting to shot you before you find their position. TSE reduces its combat validity in its greatest advantage, reducing blue weapon to green. Yup that weapon is blue even in crafted version.
---
There are certain perks and mods which are commonly neglected. Giving up information about their validity is a tactical mistake as it drives their prices up, which is why people are reluctant to talk about it. But its perfect alignment of purpose for the weapon as well as perks and mods that take the greatest benefit when combined, that defines supergold IMO and TSE is rarely the optimal fit for these equations.
---
God I need an IE lever or hunting rifle :(
---
What are the ingredients to make them? I've been very hesitant about buying the plans.
---
Welp, time to bring out that explosive troubleshooter cryolator I’ve been hanging on to!
---
You drop all your junk. Easy way to gather junk.
---
Under the. Freak show on savage divide they spawn on a wave of 3 fighting scorched formally you had ants but now big ass mantis
---
Herbivore mutation and carnival perk card to eat people. Both are active.
---
Thanks for the spell check —Speech to text.
---
Well, it's in wall decorations then.
---
I agree on this, i love housing so camp building and such is one of my favourite activity so i will be happy to see more plants to use
---
I’ve killed the flatwoods monster once and didn’t get either challenge complete
---
As much as I love Fallout 4 and 76, the control scheme and lack of keybind options makes me question Bethesda's competency as a studio.
---
That plus 1 with other strength boosting perks and such boosts me to 20+ strength so it at least does something (not much but hey it’s the thought that counts).
---
With a base super sledge I do about 475 damage, I don’t remember the power fist numbers but it benefits from both one hand weapon perks and the unarmed ones. I just want that humble plus1 bonus to feel loved.
---
I own multiple rental properties and I definitely take issue at what Bethesda is trying to pull lying about the atom shop being purely cosmetic. If you are cool with people lying to you that is your own problem. I won't ignore when being lied to.
---
It also randomly eats the remaining ammo in the core wasting large amounts.
---
Just another way they are trying to coax you to buy atoms
---
Good good, at least chassis are easy to come by
---
Its different for each one, look it up
---
Might have been before they fixed it, but you'd think they'd credit you for it anyway, since they keep track of stuff you've killed
---
I still can’t find that damn vault 51!
---
I didn’t want any spoilers about the new quest because I want to experience it for myself
---
But if I ever do this I’m going to tap B as fast as I can to try and cancel it
---
Carnival?
---
Actually, I was talking about the herbivore and carnivore mutations, misread that you were talking about the perk.
---
Too early in the morning here. *coffee needed*
---
Funny responses :) I’d like some info on this too but am assuming they will add more side quests in later. Would have been cool to get them from killing the actual creature
---
It was a joke my guy. The real sheepsqautch isnt in the game yet.

Right we’re not talking about you being mad though, we’re talking about how people who buy a lot of micros do so in a much larger/aggressive fashion than most and that’s who the company panders too.  Doesn’t matter what it was priced or advertised as, the practice of micros in paid games follows the same formula for maximum cash grab, especially after the dumpster fire this games launch was.

there is a link to the discord in the sidebar, almost directly next to this comment --&gt;

The ingredients usually consist of a couple of random junk items, one stable flux, and one ultracite.
---
Ah right, understood.
---
Japan has a new cryptocurrencies law that won't let Bethesda sell atom.
---
I know it adds 5 carry weight which is nice but I’d personally rather have anything else. It would also appear that some people think that +1 strength is incredible or something, a nice two downvotes
---
Your passion for defending griefers is astounding.
---
The point is to get your lazy ass away from your camp in the first place. You shouldn't just be able to plop down every ingredient you need in your back yard. This game is about survival, exploration and scavenging and not having everything at your fingertips. 
---
Having ingredients only available in the wild also serves as a limiter, since you can only gather so much so often you can't just mass produce chems whenever you want.
---
I got the witches hat and costume off a single witch trick or treater. Still searching for the skele hat/plans...
---
Dense mods for anything.  Basically, any mod that arbitrarily can't be acquired through scrapping.
---
The system right now randomly combines a type of weapon or armor with a random mod.  Some appear far more likely than others.  Some are always present (Chainsaw mods at Watoga).  But there are so many potential combinations that seeing a specific one you want is always problematic.
---
The hero we need.
---
A quick Google search seems to reveal that that's the case, yes
---
;) grumble grumble - my fat thumbs and a hangover, grumble
---
&gt; the game didn't let me respawn after dying

I got this yesterday, I got stuck in an infinite loading screen

---
That works for me. I'm on CET.
---
I bought separate games
---
Question for those of us on PC - when I scrap stuff, typically I go to "weapons" and rapidly press "R" and "Space" for "scrap" and "confirm". Not sure what the corresponding buttons are on console. If I'm doing my normal R - Space - R - Space spam to scrap, could this still get caught in that?
---
Yaaaasss. Every time i've tried this event it has been a brutal shitshow that failed. There's too much going on to be able to figure out what to do if you haven't looked it up beforehand.
---
I was not aware of this.
---
The stringer in general needs work. Thought I could poison bloodied or bypass sentinel armor with radscorpion barrel(40dmg dot). Nah. Nothing. Not even sure it does any dmg at all.
---
I dont think telling a certain content hadn't been released yet is a spoiler.
---
Because it doesn't really matter right now? If they all share the same cap pool anyways I'm not even sure why added them in now that I think about it..... Maybe they want this to be a proper player hub in the future. 1 bot for every person on a server?
---
They'll probably give it a facelift soon.
---
Oh,
---
I did not know that, thanks for the info :), so if you have all three you are basically the best person to fight the beast, but I have not been able to take more than one direct hit from her during the event, she is super insane when it comes to damage.
---
I like alt characters. I hope that's what they're trying to encourage and not anything unsavoury.
---
Fair ‘nuf. Reading is hard for some. We’ll see if they learn when the event is more than a few days old.
---
Sigh...Cut one head off and two more shall take its place
---
The game gives a warning for scrapping favourited items now which is good, but the numeric selling values sounds awesome!
---
Flux
---
I have had things disappear from my stash but nothing worth wild until yesterday. I played the day before and started playing the quest for Rose. I received Rose's syringe gun and went on to help a teammate with another quest. I did not have time to mod the syringer to complete the quest but it was in my inventory with the diamond beside the name. The next day when I started to play the syringer was gone. The quest still shows up to help Rose but I can not do anything with out the gun. The quest marker is now on her again but she only responds with random comments. So at this point that part of the game is broken for me.
---
Gotta watch that Vintage Nukashine.... it hits worse than a scorchbeast.
---
I feel for you on this downvote train and need to jump on because you are correct. This game is great and I love it, but I do feel ripped off by Dev’s charging me full price for an early access where we are debugging it for them as we grow.
---
I still play and find cool things to do with the new content and am greatly patching and content is flowing.
---
Problem is this and the SBQ isn't just damage the boss. There are other enemies that need to be taken down and with this new boss up to 3 people need to act as pylons and not get killed. 
---
Ideally you will have a 3 people become pylons and keep mobile, their job is to stay alive NOT to kill the boss, a few others can handle the robots while the rest take out the boss.  When you have this point system the strategy fails and people will just focus on the boss and nothing else leading to failure of the event. Seen it happen a few times already where people are too busy shooting and no one is being a pylon that stays alive.
---
Yes. This sucks! Spent 5k on my final x01 calibrated shock yesterday. Can't install it. u/ladydevann Any word on this?
---
im genuinely curious about atom sales figures.
---
I have been playing since BETA and have not spent any additional cash on the game, but I've been able to pay for everything I want by just playing the game. I've gotten 2 PA skins, both Fasnacht Masks, mothman statue, glowing map, mini nuke planter, 3 sets of floors, the blue door, hanging bulbs on a string, clean water purifiers, race car bed, nuka cola stash box, some icons, the pose pack during fasnacht, the "welcome home" neon sign, and a pip boy skin. i know im forgetting an item or two, but that's the bulk of it. i went down to zero on Tuesday because i bought the raider excavator skin. i played ~3 hours between Tuesday and Wednesday and im already back up to 600. trying to get that hunter's pack.
---
I didn’t downvote you... I agree it’s not really all that great but you can’t complain finding a three star weapon fitting your build.
---
I don't care about the griefers, I'm defending that I believe this game should be I've said many times: people should be able to do what they want in a fallout game good or evil. I think having such limited PvP limits this games potential.
---
The alien's been on that list since launch. The Flatwoods Monster is the only thing that counts towards it (it also counts for a different challenge involving cryptids). That said, I can't imagine we won't see Zetan-related content at some point.
---
I think the quest is a drain for people's stimpacks and nothing else (so you revive random people), unlike the nukes it costs 2000+ caps to buy the board and the 1 piece of legendary might be wood or better lol
---
Looks like so. Watoga is currently zero, Whitesprings and Harper's Ferry is down by 50% at least. However, West Tek is up by a factor of 3 for me. I've been avoiding it pre patch 7 because it almost never spawned legendaries. Now, I find at least one every visit.
---
Praise
---
If you have the right build. I have a friend that can easily two shot a sentinel armored player with a normal handmade at level 25. It’s all in the build
---
It is really hard to say, I always use melee, but I seem to get killed in like one second flat, no matter what I do, and even when I tried ranged I wasn't able to do much damage before the squatch went agro on me and totaled my hp bar again.
---
"recreational hatred"
---
I can agree with you on that, especially I as I only get one star from 3* lol
---

---
I’d like to trade in say 100 unused perk points for a unique shabby chic T-51b camo skin or something else rare unique and special 😎
---
If you're a high dps bloodied build type, grab it's attention and jump on the cabin. With good Power Armor, Dodgy, and Med-X running, you can tank the head laser with a stimpack or two, and the imposter will mostly just walk around down below you looking at you waiting for it's head beam to come off cooldown. I'm able to effectively "tank" the encounter this way, while also providing enough DPS to down it in 30 seconds or less once the cloaking shield is down. 
---
It seems like it actually does have a real aggro table, meaning the person who has done the most damage and is alive is who it goes after next.
---
You do know what company made this game right?
---
why do people even revive? respawn is right at the event....
---
Ok well the hostility is uncalled for. Here is the thing, no one is at their camp all the time but not many people care to spend an hour "exploring" an empty ass wasteland to get 6 flowers. If the game is about "survival" then logic would dictate that you would try making living as efficient as possible and plant whatever you needed at the place you live if you could. Your own logic works against you there. We dont need a "limiter" on cranberry juice dude.
---
Ahhh, I see. I never played survival so I wasn't aware that it would make PVP negated during the event, but the slaughter-fest after the event would be crazy XD
---
What is the double variant?
---
I just wanted the single so I bought it haha
---
This happens to me a lot just  grab a wire from the other thing and try to attach that one always works for me
---
Not 100% sure on that, I think it said something about it being available till the beginning of May, but I am not to sure for real.
---
Yes thank you for that now about the absurdly low 25k caps limit, that you can reach with ease in 18 days, don't you feel like end game items should be traded for more then that? like the last weapn you will get.buy should be bought for in game currency not real money and 25k caps is nothing.... at least double it, I mean a reciepie for 1 mutation costs about that much, why absurdly small caps cap?
---
I'm going to be hopeful and guess this issue is going to be addressed in today's hot-fix.  Again, and i stress, i'm hopeful
---
The most reliable place I know of is the  Dabney Homestead.
---
"a super rare material which apparently only drops from a scorchbeast qeen."
---
Nope. Only need access to a nuke zone to acquire these items. Simply harvest nuked plants, kill some enemies for hardened mass/high radiation fluids/glowing mass etc. , and bingo! You too can craft the stable flux you need for this item. No SBQ drops required.
---
That's kinda what I ment, is it worth building around?
---
RIP. And armor penetration still doesn't affect energy weapons. 1 step forward, 3 steps back.
---
I think he is lol
---
Even the unkind 'freeze motherfucker' sounds better with this vision in mind
---
If I recall correctly even when you’re down it still counts as being on a pylon, which means them just going down and getting rezzed is a better tactic
---
Is it really that fucking hard to actually SELECT the challenge and know what it's asking before you complain about it?
---
It's almost every other day someone quick to shit on Bethesda rushes in here to cry about missing out on 10 god damn atoms because they INSIST they're being FORCED to level up three times in a single day when all it's fucking asking you to do is level up once.
---
Got a 3 star stalker board. That VATS accuracy is amazing. Frankly its embarrassing that Bethesda cannot fix this issue.
---
Also perk cards that add DR effect it and will reduce damage output.
---
Actually, my suggestion included points for killing the ads and for being a pylons. So a low-level can get points killing the ads, someone who doesn't want the risks can take pylon and run around feeding themselves stimpacks while trying to avoid enemies, and both of them would still have a reward for participating.
---
\-2 points for just being reasonable and not outright insults the op. Sick burns mate
---
But what if you are not spamming but want to actually cancel your action? You would actually scrap it! The cancel button should always be the cancel button. They should have used a different key.

---
Yep...just surprised they’ve reached a new depth of cant be arsed
---
I've had my camp there for as long as I can remember. At first I just wanted to be near cranberries and have access to that power armor frame for cores, but lately I've had a lot of visitors and found it to be more enjoyable to have folks stop by while I'm bulking junk or brewing and cooking. Great location :)
---
It’s the other type of stair, the one that takes up two foundation spaces. But this kind does have this new atomic shop skin, just not buildable or purchasable.
---
Honestly, super mutants drop pretty good assault rifles, some worth 200-300 caps. So if you go mow a pack of them out, you should have a decent stack of weapons to sell. Also Bulk fertilizer I've noticed is easy to make and it sell decent if you stack it
---
oops, edited my comment thank you
---
Yeah I took everything off and perk card and damage went to 350. Beserkers seems pointless at this point unless some how you were negative DR because a non beserkers DCG does more damage
---
while we're on the subject, samezies with trading. 99% of the time when trying to offer a trade, i jump. sometimes more than once if im chasing down a rando lol
---
It might be a restriction by the government 
---
No way this is Bethesda fault , this type of games is a money earning business.  while at the current state that it is in won’t earn lots of money, they wouldn’t stop the potential of it.
---
I'd keep it and use it, and then swap when u get a higher level
---
I noticed at WS nuke yesterday that meat piles no longer have anything at all if you weren't involved in the kill. Used to be able to get a sufficient amount just by picking through the previously killed enemies.

Yea, ps4 to, came out of the blue, wtf?
---
Same PC
---
Good point about vendors/caps budget and I agree, but I still don't want to spend anymore on travel than I have to.  The weight reduction issue has always something each player deals with individually according to their build preferences anyway. If you are higher level and have discovered most of the world, stash boxes are usually not too far away to drop junk or loot or whatever. But that still involves FT. Lots of people have to make the choice of "Do I  carry more junk or aid, or carry more weapons?"  Some want to carry everything all the time. All my char armor is 3\* and most has a weight reduction mod for guns or junk or chems or is deep pocketed and since I found calibrated shocks for my X-01PA,  it has been even better.  I used to be able to carry alot more without my armor on than with, and I have been able to free up my weight reduction perks a level, or even get away from them entirely in some cases.  That is just adding special points to improve my build in other ways no matter how you look at it. I don't know many players who aren't always struggling with their stash weight anyway, but I was mainly thinking it would be nice to be able to pull out ammo or aid items without having to fast travel somewhere. I really don't see an issue here, but your talking points are well taken.
---
If you're talking about the two block wide frame with a see through second floor, but with the new stairs, then yes I have it.
---
Yes not able to join a Server currently. (PS4)
---
DR does very little in PvP, I ignore it myself.
---
What's the cave that's shaped like a skull,  had a few outside of it as well.
---
Great communication from Bethesda as usual
---
PS4 too.   My husband and I have tried to launch a nuke twice today and got dc'ed twice.  I'm glad they're doing maintenance but I am one frustrated lady.
---
I am so rich. Goodness, gracious. My, my, my. I am so, very, very wealthy. How many dollars do I have? That's a question only my team of ten fat accountants can answer, because they have golden calculators which I bought for them with my money. And what is on those golden calculators? Numbers. And those numbers equal the dollars in my bank accounts, which are huge.
---
I have many vehicles which I use to travel across the world and to many exotic destinations where most people cannot go, because they are so poor. They have very little in dollars, but I, myself, I have very many dollars. Also, I am sexy for a man. I like to think that if I was a woman, I would be a playboy model. But since I am a man I am like the opposite of all that, the man version.
---
In my vehicles I have stored many bottles of rare, delicious wines. These wines are hundreds of years old and covered in dust and cobwebs, which means that they are the most delicious kind, and that they were grown from grapes which were so succulent and juicy that the poor grape-pickers of France wanted to eat them right then and there. But they were whipped, by my shift-leader vintner, who makes sure that the best grapes in my vineyard go only into the wine. That's right, my great grandfather, who was also rich, owned the vineyard where this wine was made. And it's really strong too, it can get you wasted quickly.
---
I am a big time gamer in the real estate market. I speculate and consolidate my wins and losses into pure profit, keeping my blue chips in the black, playing the lady stock market, teasing and tempting her, always with my eyes on the wall street journals and calling my broker on my diamond plated iphone, which I have the most expensive plan of. I call Steve Jobs on it, and when he answers, I'm like, "Who are you? I don't know who you are because I am so rich and cool, and only nerds know who you are."
---
Then I hang up on him and laugh, lighting a big fat stogie with $300 dollars cash, which I just happened to have in my pocket because it's chump change to me.
---
But I have a tender side. Sometimes, I see a hobo. And when I see the hobo, I think to myself, "This man is poor. His monetary value is low, and my monetary value is high, and it's a shame that he is himself. What can I do?"
---
I ask the hobo if he would rather have booze or money to buy booze. If he says he wants the money, I don't give it to him because I know he'll buy booze with it. But if he says he wants the booze, I give him the money because I value honesty, even among lying hobos.
---
You may be asking yourself at this point, why is this rich man posting on a message board when he can have any woman he wants at any time he wants her, just by showing her how much money he has in his shoe? The answer is that I want to date someone who doesn't know that I am rich. I want to be anonymous. Only when we have fallen in love will I reveal to you that I am rich. That is why we must meet through this message board.
---
On our first date, I will wear normal clothes like from Wal-mart, that most people wear. And I will turn on the music on my stereo, when I'm picking you up, and it will play "Jamie's Cryin'", just like normal people listen to. I'll sing along as I drive you to the local Sonic and buy you a cherry limeade, being careful not to tip the carhop so you won't think that I have more money than I'm letting on.
---
By this time you'll be thinking that I'm just like you, poor and smelly. But then we'll drive back to a hotel, only you will think we are going to Motel 6. But then we will pull up to the Marriott, and I'll smile knowingly. You might think that I have won the lottery recently, but I won't let on. Then when we get to the room I'll order room service, again, not telling you that I'm richer than a donkey's ass, just coolly ordering some duck l'orange and some fries.
---
Finally, you'll be dying to know how I can afford such luxury. At that point I'll be like, "It's because I am rich." and then I'll pull off my flannel and be wearing a tuxedo underneath, and you'll be like, "Oh my God! You ARE rich." And then a helicopter will pull up to the window, with my butler Jenkins leaning out, holding a bottle of Chablis and a towel on his arm.
---
"Evening Sir!" he'll say in his trademark way, and I'll say, "Jenkins! Let's go to Borneo tonight, eh? Can the GoldenDollarSign," (the name of my helicopter) "get us there in time for cocktails?"
---
When we arrive in Borneo we'll land on top of my tallest skyscraper, and I'll propose to you, handing you a ring made of pure platinum, with 0% impurities.
---
I can't wait to surprise you with that ring. I'm looking at it now. Send me an email if this could be you.
---
Yours,
---
Rich Bigdollars (Not my real last name.)
---
Im enjoying the game, dont misconceive this. No one spoke about 'beating' the game. Just the futility of a singular mechanic that effects an invested Character of said game. I.E. Levels mean literally nothing past 50 when its easier to just make a new Character when you want to play a new Build as opposed to gaining the levels and perk cards in order to optimise your current Build that you're wanting to play.
---
I've been here since Beta too, however I haven't played from then, until now. I've also been playing primarily Solo.  
---
I uninstalled the game after the first Stash increase patch as I was somewhat bored of the Weight juggle, so decided it best to come back at a later date rather than carry on.
---
Just came back and I am playing my main character again. I need to level up 14 times in order to reallocate my Specials, not including Perk Cards I need to attain in order to optimise my build style for one singular character.
---
I haven't done the math but I am presuming by the time I level from 77 to 78 the amount of XP I have gotten and the time it takes, I could have gotten from level 1 to 10 on a new character build. 10 Perks as opposed to 1 point/perk relocation.
---
Playing as much as you probably do however, I can understand it not being a problem as you've most likely got points 'Banked'. The Game isnt a grind, but the leveling to relocate points for an optimal build, is. Especially when at this point in time I am solely playing in order to get my build optimised, where as you probably are not.
---
To be fair, hip-fired guns aren't really a thing IRL.  Some of the early Gatling gun variants did have sights, and all modern mounted or handheld weapons have sights, so I don't think it's unreasonable that they included one with these guns. I will concede that using one to aim while firing the guns from the hip is a bit of a stretch, but this is the same game that allows you to insta-heal broken bones with a needle prick, so I'm willing to overlook some technical issues in the name of gameplay mechanics.
---
Fixing dupe glutch?
---
I feel yeah. I've only ever found or received one handmade. Not sure if it was looted or from a quest but it was in my inventory one day.
---
I recently found a trader and bought a 1 star handmade for $800 caps.
---
Side note - I spent 3 weeks trying to activate penitentiary quest lines in an attempt to receive hand made plans to later find they are purchasable at vendors. I kept reading they are not available after level 25, that was patched out.
---
&gt;  If the game is about "survival" then logic would dictate that you would  try making living as efficient as possible and plant whatever you  needed at the place you live 
---
This exactly. In any good survival situation it stands to reason you'd want to be able to plant and harvest crops. Being (mostly) self-reliant is important. If the goal was to make us forage all the time, why allow us to plant anything at home?
---
I'm still waiting for the stealth meter to stop jamming and my alt weapon to stop getting un-equipped. De-equipped? Also, I kept seeing enemies randomly drop dead the other day. I thought there was a stealth sniper player messing with me. And I'd really like to stop encountering level 62 enemies at low levels just because a level 247 player happened to go past an hour ago.
---
If they're worried about low level characters farming cranberries for the xp boost than they should add in region based plants to the camp build menu. So if you're camp is in the Savage Divide you can plant carrot flowers but not snaptail reeds, in the Forest snaptail reeds and not carrot flowers and etc. Obviously more than just one specific plant per region. I dont think it would make sense to be able plant cranberries in the Ash Heap.
---
Good to know
---
They posted about it yesterday, saying that server maintenance was going to happen. Assuming it's to fix some of the issues from the recent patch, and I hope, to add in some of the missing content from the patch also.
---
oh boy...this won't go over well
---
Don't worry. With this new attention to it they'll figure it out
---
Level 5 leather armor with perfect legendary effects is better than maxlevel marine with crappy effects.
---
i'm glad it's not just me. for some reason.
---
No shit, last I remember I was at the radio array and now I wake up at the  workshop with a wrench in my hand and lube on my mouse.
---
But can you build it because myself and many others cannot. Why make a new skin for it if it’s not going to be buildable or purchasable
---
I've found that while using the space-bar (PC) is needed to start a wire, you can use "E" to attach the other end and this avoids the jumping problem. Though there are times it does not want to attach a wire either way and I have had to exit build mode and then go back in again to get the interface to work properly.
---
Anyone notice the dead Zetan in the closet at the Lewisberg Taxidermy?
---
I actually take it a step further and cast Spotify on my phone to my Xbox, so I can easily switch between songs, change volume, etc, without having to tab out of the game.
---
I like to drop giant stacks of them in crowded areas, like after events. Inevitably, people will look in the bag, laugh to themselves, then drop their own requisition holotapes next to mine.
---
My first thought was “pay caps to watch?! Screw that”, but then I remembered this is exactly the kind of socialization activity that should’ve been built into the game, this is what Combat Zone *should have* been, and now I’m more than happy to pay to support some cool, player made RP.
---
I always liked using the prefab barn from 4 and improving on it. It has a nice big open room to put crafting stuff, then a small little room to put your bed. Quite minimilist while still being large enough to hold all the essentials
---
It’s going to be another worthless named legendary that you can get better versions of just from random drops. It will have some name like Destroyer and be a level 30 two star equivalent weapon that will end up in vendor inventory. They really need to spend a few minutes looking at the trading subreddits to see what people are truly interested in obtaining
---
I just feel like I'm contributing a little :)
---
The Uranium Fever event is decent.  Mole Miners drop shotguns and mole miner gauntlets.
---
I think repair kits would be dipping a toe in the water to move towards pay to win. Certainly not a cosmetic item.
---
Everytime I get home early and have some time to finally play, there seems to be a maintenance going on
---
Not all plants are able to be cultivated, even by specialists.
---

I've got one and I'll give it to you for 2k.  However, I won't be home till about 6pm Central.  Send me a message GT TeamRagnar48 and I'll find you then
---
My bunker base doesn't have room for it so I never tried, definitely appeared green though when I moved it around!
---
I will try it later and report back if you like?
---
Its much easier to manage your inventory once you have your build in order. You know what you will need and what your character wont ever need. Most of the junk is useless, and if you find you need something that you dont have, its a good reason to go out in the wasteland to look for it. 
---
If youre hoarding legendaries, build another character and have a friend help you swap them. But once the legendary vendor is released, i doubt inventory space will be a concern anymore. Most of my inventory is filled with useless 3* that im holding onto until then.
---
I thought it was an animatronic from nuka world
---
Hmm yeah true I don't think I've seen them so often.
---
I did, still was like nuking the faschnat parade. Like thanks fuck hat, but yeah you get decent supplies ONLY if you prenuke
---
LOL oh, okay, now I know who you are. Yeah, honestly I have no interest in stalking you, being upset about being "sonned", or being on your dick.   
---
Have you recently suffered a head injury?
---
Seems like I'm looting more purified water, too. Even with constantly chugging it, I still end every session since the patch with heaps of extra water.
---
spoiler posts should not contain spoilers in the title
---
Ahhh, I was just getting settled in for a sesh too.
---
That argument "your character can, but the payer can't"... is fantastic! But it doesn't hold water, considering all the other player skills that are held above character skills, and all the meta-build stuff available.
---
If the game made you build your character as it grows, and made you stick with it (No perk swapping, for example) then yeah, I'd agree, 100%.
---
Ya seems kinda silly that a player can contest it repeatedly.
---
it's a spoiler, and spoiler posts should not have spoilers in the title
---
It’s not buildable. And I have tried.
---
You’re meta gaming. This is the source of your frustration with the game. You want the perfect build with the perfect weapons and perfect spot for a perfectly constructed camp. 
---
My sincerest advice is to try not to think in terms of optimization. Just explore and have fun.
---
Oh thats why i have an extra ultra cite pa helmet
---
Curious, will this take same amount of time as the patch? Or are these hot fix usually shorter?
---
An idea came to me. If planter boxes worked like a water purifier. Just like 10lb storage/box but this is a ton of plants. The plants within dont fill up camp budget but the planters do. You drop in a plant of up to 4 different types and the corners grow different lootable plants to fill that to the original 10lb weight.
---
I'm sure I can word this better I'm waking up.
---
Nope, it holds on that for the whole duration (if 5 frames can be called a "Duration").
---
thank you!  post spoilers all you want, but make sure it has the spoiler flair and there are no spoilers in the title, it's not that hard.
---
I saw it at one of the raider vendor bots yesterday as well
---
There's a big twist at the end where you find out you were the Sheepsquatch the whole time.
---
it was found long ago, yes.
---
If you're on PC, you can use the E key to attach the wire once you have it floating from one connection.  It's the "interact" button, whatever that might be on x-box or playstation.
---
Did they change the timing for the caps reset? Used to be around 3 pm cet.  Now its over 4pm and still at zero caps.
---
My issue is I do get three stars... lvl 10 ones or lvl 30 ones. Can’t wait for the legendary vendor....
---
Eh? Don't get it .... you 'finish' the game at level 27 but complain side quests are too hard???
---
Berserkers work naked
---
I think it's 20 IRL hours or something.
---
Then that just punishes everyone else. Let’s be honest there are more important issue with 76 that needs to be addressed. It’s like out of all the complaints why this one, and why be snarky about it. I was talked into playing this game by my best friend, and I’m glade he did. I have been playing this game for 18 weeks. In that time I have logged almost 750 hours. I like this game, I like the idea that this game could become and I’ll support Bethesda as long as I see the game going in a positive duration. However Bethesda is not in the position to be snarky. With everything the community has put up with to give them time to get their act together. That kind of snark makes companies go bankrupt.
---
If only this maintenance did any good. I get a lot of disconnects since the new event.
---
Gotcha thanks
---
The glowing blood is also worth selling
---
Exactly just SURVIVE
---
You get so many perk cards that character builds aren't as rigid. It's easy to be a generalist if you want. The only big choice is between guns and melee. VATS builds with high agility and luck are really good for PvE.
---
Yep..just kicked in - Maintenance. I hope( and I hope to be proved wrong) that Bethesda fix the damage to camps issue. It was a glaring error missed from last patch. I don't think they will do it today but I'm hoping they do.
---
Why are you bringing us into this, im finnish how does this habe to do anything with me
---
Yea of course ... always during Euro Daytime ... Bethesta must really hate us europeans
---
Won't they get killed easily?
---
there are soooo many things in this game that would work in a syringer, so much untapped potential...
---
Oh well I didn't see it before on any maps so...
---
You could turn the other volumes down, same difference?
---
To fix the major bugs in the last update.  Always a hotfix after they update.
---
It's an update to fix the update
---
I did t think of that because it's so easy to just look at Plan: whatever, ect. 
---
I never keep nonessential notes anyway. What's the point?
---
To fix the update.
---
Well if you sneak, you don't need dr and sentinel works only standing, so it may be good. If was sneak working. So yeah it is pointless.
---
Well, the stash limit has increased quite a lot to 800 and now the vendors share their caps (all at 1400 rather than 7x 200 caps). This saves up a lot of time spending time on “side” stuff, which is something I can appreciate having quite a busy job myself. This means you’ll have more time for the fun stuff: meeting others, finding plans, modding stuff, whatever you like really.
---
But surely your get home from work time is other people's quietest time? For me, it's 3pm. Good time in the UK for it, as it's back up not long after home time  (though sad for my son, who finishes school at 3pm).
---
I did select it. Also, it was just an easy to use example of several recent ridiculous ones. I haven't seen any of these regular complaints, but if they are regular complaints, maybe people are annoyed. I'm sure the large company isn't going to complain to its mother that I'm bullying it, so chill out.
---
Yes but the main priority is that maintinence is always finished when cali ppl get home from school and work
---
I sell mutation serums. 500 is more than players pay and easier to do.
---
I assume they'd be shorter than a patch, but it depends on what their fixing I'd guess. I know I've had a few crashes since the new update was brought out. I also noticed there's some content missing (saw it on a person's datamined list.) that I hope at least get's added, but if not, then hopefully next week with the dungeon.
---
spoiler posts should not contain spoilers in the title, posting about spoilers, with the spoiler flair, is fine as long as it has the flair and no spoilers in the title.
---
Yeah but it kinda doubles the damage , kinda funny if you ask me since it’s truly funny to see someone naked wielding a guitar sword or something
---
Is the new mission end game? I read the legendary you receive is level 30.
---
They target you and your schedule specifically, so you have a point.
---
Never thought of that for some reason. 
---
Guess that means there really isnt much need for a change after all
---
Workshop claiming/holding is not pvp. Whoever holds it is doin so in order to obtain the benefits of having it, so that's what makes having a workshop worth it. Taking it is the only time you can get murdered so if you can't handle it, leave it alone.
---
This is why Beth made it disputable: great benefit if you can hold it king of the hill style. Don't wanna deal with the chance of getting player killed then go scavenging like everyone else.
---
You totally missed the point. 
---
There’s lots of players that want this.
---
So they did it. Now there’s lots of players that are upset that they did it.
---
There was no real good way to stick these vendors into Whitesprings
---
So just do it and not spend to much time trying to make things realistic for players that don’t give a crap.
---
The Assaultrons just want to give you a hug! Of dismemberment and death. 'tis true that they are very hard to stagger consistently compared to the Gutsys.
---
A million times this. Yes yes yes yes yes.
---
Damn, any idea on what challenge?
---
https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1116106263631486976?s=19
---
Would you prefer if they rang you personally?
---
Yes, I forgot about that. Thank you.
---
yeahh, im 420+ hours in, obviously endgame, but i don't rush the content. i still have things that i haven't done in vanilla. im super excited to do the Sheepsquatch questline, but i shouldn't have it ruined for me bc i didn't jump into it the moment the patch went live.
---
It’s not. It’s by the stream so I can collect the purified water. It’s been the best spot for fast traveling for me lately &amp; usually I don’t have problems, but the last few times I’ve logged on I’ve had issues with people.
---
It was posted about yesterday and stated in game, this was communicated ahead of time that they would be doing this to fix some issues.
---
Despite how much you want to play the game it is a lot more important they actually make it work better. More maintenance is far from bad because this game desperately needs it especially after big content updates
---
It would definitely be interesting to have things like that actually work so there are work arounds to certain builds
---
Then explain to me why I can buy V-Bucks for Fortnite and Ubicoins for Far Cry/Assassin's Creed? 
---
And also why I can see fuck tons of ads for Bitcoin when walking at Shibuya? 
---
Do you even know what you're talking about?
---
My advice, keep playing and you'll get better at managing resources. I wouldn't keep moving your base either, find a decent spot that's on the opposite side of the map from Vault 76 with a resource prefarably you you can mine those. This way you'll have a free fast travel point at your base and a fast travel point at vault 76 both which are free. Plant some crops at base craft food, corn  soup is a decent starter, fills water and food. Look out for Red Rocket buildings and theyll usually have a stash box, if youre over encumbered just fast travel back to base and drop off. Sell weapons you find off of enemies for easy caps until you get a nice stash for yourself. Interact with other players, most are really helpful and have stuff to sell too. Whitesprings Resprt has all the vendors now so it's easy to sell a bunch of stuff at one location. Hope that's helps a bit, keep exploring!
---
I just mowed some lawn, and cut down a lot of thorny bushes, I was  looking forward to logging on just now when I got home, so I feel your pain, they literally could not do it at a better time when less players are on? I mean it can't be the least players online right now?
---
I always assumed the servers were area based... I’m in Australia too (XB1) and all the people I’ve met just from talking to on the server have also been Aussie. But I’ve also met people from reddit and played on servers with mostly American people too.
---
&gt;I bet my cap collection that I could nuke 2800 dgm into group of lvl 40 scorched group without killing more than few. 
---
you would end up killing all of them.
---
I support such gamemode being added as a separate gamemode. Seasonal hardcore, with seasons much quicker than regular seasonal survival, like weekly - that would be neat.
---
In europe was time change, in america they don't have it. It is same reason why we have now patches on another hour like before
---
how are people that haven't done the quest supposed to know that?  I was expecting to see a sheepsquatch at the end, I didn't even do the quest and it's ruined for me...
---
Very good, not a lot of people saw though obviously
---
Yeah I don't see the benefit from it. I had almost 500 DR and regular DCG did like 350 damage. I had to take off all perks and cards to get down to 50 DR and the beserkers DCG went from like 220 to 355. Lose 450 DR to gain 5 damage?
---
I started liking the ranged versus effects (+43% effective damage) and they are a bit better than *Anti-armor* (+28% effective damage) in my calculations. *Quad* is great for the Golf Club and *Vampiric* is great in the SBQ event. The rest are useless for my build.
---
And if there was a bug or issue that really bothered you 
---
You’d be demanding this kind of patch
---
Wait, you can switch from "level up 3 times" to "level up once" ???
---
Hope they fix the jacked up friends &amp; vendor inventory lists!!
---
It's definitely still a thing tho. The people I know who are serious about PvP are buying their gear en Ebay and it's clearly not legit gear. Even if it was legit some sets are broken and make players pretty much invulnerable especially if 3 of them have same godlike sets. Not super enjoyable
---
Thanks. Good to know these things. Only been playing 76 for 3 weeks.
---
I feel you man. I just put the kids to sleep here in Beijing and hop on to play. Half an hour later server shutdown. Just the bad luck of being in different time zones
---
Extremely useful and get a weapon that blocks and reflects 50% damage.
---
I don’t destroy other people’s camps there. I don’t have it right behind the clubhouse with middle turrets like other people, I have it on the stream. But I think it’s completely childish that people don’t like it, throw a fit &amp; destroy it.
---
Email to Bethesda account emails? Not everyone has Twitter, or reads their forums every day.
---
Yes. Took six reboots to finally complete the Sheepsquatch quest, after continual hangs and crashes especially inside the Inventory. Unfortunately the temporary processor affinity fix (disabling cores) for the x700 AMD Ryzen is now only working intermittently. Has Bethesda actually communicated with AMD and Intel for a workaround or permanent fix?
---
I was on a server with ‘totenmeister’ and ‘nakamoto’, so yeah i guess people from all over the world are on those servers (run by Amazon right?)
---
ATOM isn't crypto, it's not even backed by a blockchain ledger.
---
Servers are undergoing maintenance atm, chill man.
---
The pharma pharma and can-do perks are game changers at the beginning of the game. It's easy to find food and chems with a few ranks in each.
---
As far as offense just pick 1 ranged type and 1 melee and level up the cards. 
---
If you are getting stomped by enemies you probably progressed too far. Just stick to areas that are challenging and level up a bit.
---
This (and other keyboard issues while in base-building mode) has been a problem since Fallout 4.  It has something to do with the original programmers from F4 didn't properly program keyboard customization into the Workshop building screen, and for reasons that are not clear, it's apparently was going to be a major issue to fix.
---
I use a custom keyboard bind (I'm a QEWS person) and I can't strafe left while in build mode because Q is hard-coded for some other damn Workshop//CAMP command.
---
10,000 caps is way too much. Don't spend over 3k. Check out r/fo76bazaar
---
Just make a post like: W: tse shotgun.  H: caps
---
You should get some action and not get ripped off.
---
Are you fucking kidding?  Even if it isn't tagged as a spoiler how the fuck do you wander into a thread explicitly titled about the larger implications of a quest line and then start bitching that you apparently DIDN'T want to know about the larger implications about a quest line?
---
Got my camp next to watoga station. Got brain fungus 2 tar berry some diseased cranberry and a glowing fungus all feet from my door an cranberries 100 feet south.
---
Their last twitter post said this was a server maintenance and not a content/code change at all.
---
It would be incredibly short sighted on Bethesda's part to make this event temporary imo.  It is a challenging event and IT'S SOMETHING NEW! That's why I stated access would probably be easier later on and maybe they will reduce the cooldown time.  I wasn't arguing for it at all and still don't have a clue why it's so long.  Server hopping is something we all do to try to maximize our gains or access to events.  I server hopped for 8 hrs. solid one day looking for calibrated shocks for my X-01 armor right after I got it.  Lol, I'm sure I went way past 50.
---
sounds good just tell me where and when to meet you
---
Im tired of getting wood armor or trapper armor.
---
Problem is, they are doing all servers at same time. Blizzard had different server for america and europe so they did updates overnight. 
---
I would be happy if bethesda did something similar.
---
Since the latest patch I have lost several high-value items, the worst being a L50 Anti-Armor Dragon and Raider right leg calibrated shocks. Others as well, but these two are the most upsetting. Thing is, i used the new item rename tool to label everything I want to keep with a leading dash e.g. - Anti-Armor Dragon. That keeps them at the top when sorted. 
---
I have read about the item loss/dupe bugs above and wonder if this is related to my own losses. I hope they reappear after this bugfix, but it seems to be a push/pull thing: fix one bug and a new one appears. It is disheartening and makes me nervous about what will break next whenever the servers are patched. 
---
Fingers crossed......
---
Why?
---
yeah and my mother beats me
---
I think I go with usual heavygun, PA, stagger everything down build if things get too messed up.
---
Made me think; I’m not really in the market to buy them but did go looking for the exchange rate during “repair kit-gate” and couldn’t easily find how!? Presume you can in the UK?
---
How long is this event going on? I don't want to show up and mooch off of higher level players since I'm only level 25...
---
A
---
Aa
---
Aab
---
ABb
---
BBB
---
And just add those to the end even better just rename your weapons a aa aaa or aaab
---
If you want to stay informed Twitter and their forums is where they mention stuff like this. It's not their fault you'd rather shit on them than actually look for yourself
---
would rather them add faction cosmetics first
---
Summer time in the forest. Gettin HOT
---
If you're optimizing a bloodied build, this could easily carry you past level 50 until you find a higher level Bloodied. The other two effects on this one are easily replaceable however. You can replace it rather fast if you prefer sitting at high health though.
---
Only level 40 though...
---
Let's migrate to america. Haha.
---
It doubles the base carryweight so it happens without calibrated shocks for months now when logging out in it and then loggin back in.
---
As far as junk goes, keep an eye on what you actually use. Keep the rare stuff like springs,screws, ballistic fiber,  etc. I try to keep 3-5 bulk of the remaining materials. Either drop or sell off all that extra crap.
---
I can't help you in depth, but Vats do work well in fallout 76. Its just that pistols are a bit underpowered atm. I'd actually recomend for you to use a shotgun build. Most shotgun perks are under Strength, which also will increase your carry weight. Tons of mobs (Scorched and Mole miners) carry shotguns and shotgun shells as well, so it is easy to get ammo for it. With the Enforcer perk from Agility you can also have a good chance to cripple enemies (Wave at a deathlcaw that is stumbling around paniced on the ground). 
---
I found a shotgun build: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f448f73&amp;d=sp2st1sd2su2so2pc2ee2ck0as2a80a72la2i12ib4id2c62cf0cu0cm0p00ih1sy0&amp;w=&amp;n=Shotgun%20build&amp;m=
---
I wouldnt personaly use this exact build, but it can give you some inspiration. At lvl 7 you can get the perk Can Do! From luck, which might allow you to find canned food/purified water from containers(such as trash). They dont ever go bad so its very handy. With the perk "Good doggy" from Endurance you can get 3 times the benefit from dog food, which also can be found with "Can do". Personally I only run around with Dog food and Purified water thanks to those two perks and never really worry about food.
---
Me too, I always end up scrapping more than I should have.
---
They’re updating the update so the update is up to date.
---
I'm not suggesting they do both. I am suggesting they do one or the other. To the best of my knowledge, this is the only MMO (which it isn't even a true MMO, but that's a whole different argument) where end game bosses don't drop at least one end game item with a 100% chance. It is also the only MMO that I am aware of where an end game boss can drop complete garbage. Not an item that is garbage for your class/build but complete garbage in the sense that literally no one would want to use the item. 
---
The issue isn't even that the above scenario occurs, the issue is that it occurs at an overwhelmingly high rate due a few reasons: there is an RNG check to see whether or not a 3* will drop, then there is another RNG check for the type of item, then there is another RNG check for each legendary modifier on the item. From other people's experiments, it also seems that the RNGs are weighted towards armor. 
---
So here is what the average player is up against: find and farm the legendary enemies, hope a 3* drops, hope the 3* is an item that works for their build, hope the item has decent modifiers. In the case of end game bosses, spend an enormous amount of caps or play time just getting the boss to spawn, then hope that enough people show up in time to actually kill it. 
---
Both of the bosses are high risk/investment and low reward. 
---
The problem of items being so rare is really a design decision to make grinding items the end game to cover for the fact that there is not really any end game. Look at WoW, look at GW2, look at Destiny 2, etc. All of these games, the game play part of the game STARTS when you hit level cap. Previous to this you are questing and experiencing the story. Once you hit the level cap there is a lot to do: dungeons/instances, structured and rewarding PvP, faction reputation grinds which are rewarding, etc. etc. 
---
A big problem with 76 is that they chose to monetize a majority of the cosmetic items, which detracts from the end game because they could have used them as faction or side quest chain rewards or instanced pvp instead. This would have given something that feels rewarding that could be attained through game play and expanded the end game beyond just grind for a TSE nerf gun of all-slaying.
---
Downvote me all you want but holy hell - this game will never get rid of duping.
---
It’s definitely endgame sheepsquash can one hit most everything. Very fun event
---
This rule sucks balls
---
Standard operating procedure for online games is to push updates into production without testing them. Who has the time or money for testing, amirite? In the words of the immortal Bill O'Reilly, "F\*CK IT! WE'LL DO IT LIVE!".
---
Naturally this breaks many things, but who cares? At least the company saved money. No need to hire testers or extra devs, let the players do that for you. /s
---
Obviously I'm kidding and sarcastic, but this practice really has got to stop, and I'm not necessarily pointing the finger purely at Bethesda here. It's now a common practice, and it's abhorrent. It's understandable if you're in a BETA or an early access game, not in a live service after full release.
---
brew 10 drinks
---
I assume the reward will be labeled properly
---
This is the first I have heard about Europe having different timers for vendors.  Their patch notes even said it is 20 IRL hours.
---
Alts rule
---
My deepest apologies to you personally for not being the ideal human and doing exactly as you do.
---
Well it appears silt beans, firecap, and a few others were cultivated by the now dead folks of the regions.  I’ve seen them around flatwoods and the roofs of... Lynchburg I think it was.
---
RIP
---
Xbox 1X. I had a 5 minute timer before shutdown.
---
It's okay for players to have to leave their camp sometimes.
---
What happened to player vending I thought that was supposed to drop the same day?
---
No problem mate,
---
i find it easier to only collect the blood and scrap-bulk-sell everything else.
---
Though i don't use power armor a lot 😊
---
This sort of comment really grinds my gears, its the same as the people who come on Reddit to ask why they can't play when the scheduled weekly server downtime is in effect. If you want to stay informed it's up to you, not anyone else.
---
There are lot more fallout players in Europe.
---
I'm not risking jacking anything up
---
What is End Game Loot in a game that is always progressing? Todays End Game Loot is the crap of tomorrow.
---
That sounds terrible, you should give it to me so you don't feel tempted to use it.
---
Thanks I was honestly worried about this.  Time to fix my PSN name!
---
just join me then i will be on
---
that would be too op, you could just build a farm and nuke it for flux
---
Wouldnt that actually be great for the new Sheepsquatch event? If you are grouped at least ;)
---
Senseless I’m guessing the idea is for low level to take advantage maybe
---
will do
---
No, because cards are link to your region store. 
---
OP is using Japanese PSN store so your US PSN card won't work. And even if it works, problem is ATOM is not available in Japan because it just doesn't exist in the store. You can't find it. And when you try to buy it from Fallout 76, it will open the store telling you "Item not found".
---
Only way to make it work is for OP to create a new PSN account linked to the US region. You don't need VPN for that.
---
I almost lost my Bloodied Explosive Sniper rifle doing this yesterday at whitesprings. Another player ran over to the bag but luckily I was right above it so he was probably getting the trade confirmation instead of access to my bag. I drop this weapon about 3 times a week in this way.
---
Is there plans there then or..... ?
---
it fucking bugs me because it updated on monday, i was out on tuesday and today there is another fucking server maintenance.
---
Fallout 76 has the potential to be a very good game but Bethesda seems determined to stuff it up for the majority of players, yes I do get many disconnects/freezes coupled with crappy loot drops, 3 star legendarys dropping 1 stars, did uranium event today and out of three 3 star legendary mole supervisors I got a 1 star drop and the other two had nothing, zilch, nada.
---
My load screens take an absolute age to load and then when I go into a world I either get a freeze or a disconnect, making this so enjoyable (sarcasm), fusion cores seem to run down at an alarming rate, food spoils rapidly, if I get killed in my excavator armour it reverts back to the low weight (glitch, still not fixed) then I am overencumbered when I spawn back in, I seem to spend a good majority of my time finding food and fusion cores to the point it is now becoming very tedious, I ask myself why am I still playing this shitty game, I have no idea maybe I am the eternal optimist and I hope it will get better but in fact with the disconnects etc it seems to be getting worse.
---
Bethes'duh doesnt care. Thst Howard fool needs a haircut and a punch in the balls. Lol
---
I logged in at my camp and suddenly there were molerats chewing up my stuff. Killed them and this challenge popped - didn't even know about it. Nice.
---
Aren’t we still in BETA? Well, it feels that way at times at least.
---
Gotta learn to not take things so personally or seriously on the internet dude.
---
Glad it's not just me. I changed my PSN and was mortified to see the Bethesda.net login error. Their server status site said online and I for sure thought it was to do with my name change.
---
But you do have an interest in calling random people a cuck? Yeah I’m the one with the head injury smfh
---
In adventure mode players can’t hurt you anymore, so you don’t have to worry about unwanted pvp. Hopefully camp protection will come with player vending soon. So don’t worry about pvp if you don’t go into Survival mode.
---
This game really favors pure builds thanks to the perk cards. You can however switch builds once you reach over lvl100 when you’ve accumulated more cards. But to start, pick your favorite gun type, i.e. pistol or shotgun or rifle or heavy or a type if melee, and then build your cards and acquire/farm your weapons, armor and gear that help the build. There’s a lot of useful posts on builds here or fallout builds site. Try things out and see what works for you. 
---
Quality of life will get significantly better after about lvl45. You can have mutations and QOL cards to ease the burden of micro management. For example, take carnivore or herbivore mutation, and you don’t have to farm food anymore. Pick up meat from corpses or pick berries when you pass by them, bam! You’ve got food. Healing factor allows you to carry no more than 5 stims unless you’re in SQB or Sheepsquash fight. 
---
Once you have your weapons, armor and power armor all set up, the only junk you need is the mats you need to repair them. So mark those on your search menu and you should run into plenty of them. Sell the rest for caps.
---
Life is much, much easier after lvl70-ish when you have most of your perks cards done. Get a good weapon for your build is key to not feeling grindy. If enemies seem too hard atm, make some friends and level up together. It makes the leveling a lot easier and more fun. Before you know, you’ll be working on you 2nd and 3rd character like the rest of us. Lol
---
Good luck and see you in the wasteland!
---
I absolutely refuse to run marsupial (optimized bloodied build) because it's the dumbest fucking thing that's ever been added to any video game ever created, and anyone that uses it should be banned for their complete and total lack of reverence for this franchise. I am not exaggerating.   
---
Also, what does marsupial add to a bloodied build, besides the ability to jump high?
---
Your comment made me laugh. I realized that I had forgotten the storyline. It seems so long ago. I was so gun ho about making a difference. Now I’m strung out on furry and carving my way through the wasteland looking for my next fix.
---
I’m hoping this is part of the Purveyor.  I’ve got a few sentimental weapons I’d love to put back into use.
---
I love helping I'm like an angel
---
limiting the number of each type would be a good idea, I still think there should be a few that you can't, or at least you should have to have water for some, like bloodleaf
---
I keep finding tech data laying on the ground, had one laying on a rock right outside my camp door last night. It  says I can "take" or "steal" but won't pick it up.
---
I completed the event 2 times and i once got a 1\*rolling pin and then a 1\* chameleon. These drops are real, not memes.
---
Yup have 0 problem with people discussing the spoilers in this forum. However adding story elements from new quests on post titles is another thing
---
That's why Poe's Law exists.

While I don't think ALL is reasonable, there are definitely some that it seems ridiculous you can't grow at your CAMP, Silt Beans in particular are shown in planters at flatwoods.
---
Like wat lol?
---
Wait a second, can you actually play fallout games on China?
---
Like effin seriously
---
Hey there, try filing a ticket. If you do, recommend making it clear the syringer is a quest item. Don’t think support policy has changed meaning they can’t restore but thus is a quest item so.. maybe.
---
Surprised bethesda hasn't thought of this feature yet
---
&gt;!You're a moron!&lt;
---
I'm glad it's not just me, this is one of the most annoying things in the game at the moment for me aside from disconnects.
---
Please change it to something else, or at least let us rebind it.
---
I hope they don’t go further and get rid of all the vendor bots in the game and just have a terminal in our camps to buy stuff which then gets delivered by drone.  To hell with whats loosely described as lore/story
---
there is not one plant on the planet a human can't grow
---
Agreed. It's really tough being a pylon AND getting in a shot. Thing is the event can't succeed without a pylon, so yeah how about adding in some incentive considering it takes like three or four stimpacks to get through the DoT.
---
I would rock the shit out of it
---
just use a pistol to charge your VATS crit meter

Not that I've seen yet, but I'm really hoping there will be!

It's totally cool looking.

"I told someone not to call me a cuck on a public forum on the internet and I got called a cuck, I will not stand for this targeted harrassment"

It was a joke, chill the fuck out before you have an aneurysm.
---
You gotta learn to look before you make blatant remarks. It's like beating a dead horse at this stage with the anti Bethesda comments
---
Xbox went down too, thought it was just for PC’s ??? Annoying
---
Ur server want nuked that's why..only legendaries I'm saving is AA B etc
---
We did it with a team of 3 sharing team medic. We each tagged a pylon and then just payed into him. With team medic you’re not spamming stims every 3 seconds. It’s much easier.
---
We also did it with a robotics expert who just ran around pacifying all the other robots so we could focus on the pylons then the sheepsquatch. This was by far our easiest run of it.
---
Oh OK. 
---
Thanks?
---
I don't like micro transactions but they are here to stay because they do make companies money.
---
There's nothing I can do about it but grump.
---
I think the 4% might also just be a reflection of a slightly more casual player base on console as opposed to pc, specifically i feel like there’s a lot more 12-16 year olds who play on console rather than pc and more ppl 20+ who play on pcs, not just with fo76 but gaming in general.
---
Upgrading the min level of a weapon would be a cool option for the legendary vendor, for sure.  Spend 10 points to bump the level of the weapon up the next tier, or whatever an appropriate exchange rate would be.
---
Saying that, the difference between a lvl 35 and lvl 45 weapon's damage isn't all that significant.  I started using [this pickaxe](https://imgur.com/uF0aaSZ) for Whitesping nukes, and it seem to do about the same damage as my lvl 50 anti-armor super sledge.  It weighs 0.45 with three ranks of Martial Artist, so it's easy to keep around for ghoul situations.
---
Is it just me or didn’t there used to be a maintenance announcement on the main menu stating the time it would happen?
---
I didn’t see that today, so that’s why I was caught off guard! I get Bethesda emails and honestly didn’t see the email yesterday.
---
dolly sods campground and tanagra town have one most of the time
---
Stated in game, really? I haven't seen the usual heads-up at the menu for like weeks.
---
My friend was reporting the same thing yesterday with a stack of 8, maybe they are stopping people from trading them?
---
I had no idea. Thank you for the info.
---
u/LadyDevann, please we're begging you to pass this along.
---
Jet packs ok marsupial not ok?
---
No Brother, I feel your Pain
---
And its been like this in most games ... So strap in, as long as we get weekly patches (and then hotfixes) you'll lose 2 half days
---
After the wire is initially created the "Interact" button on a console controller becomes the button to connect it to the second connector, no more confusion.
---
I mean, it is energy. Bullets are physical objects being launched ar high speeds,lasers are just light and heat if I'm correct
---
&gt; Seriously stop blaming Bethesda
---
Seriously stop acting like a Goddamn brainwashed cultist.
---
This was two month ago dude.
---
I activated it, had 2/3 of the server show up and run around in circles with no clue what to do. Three people running around with the question mark emote, two players running around jacking everyone’s bag, two or three hiding in the shack, and me and one other player trying to act as conduits.  It’s a big cluster F right now because apparently no one can read the prompts on the screen.
---
It was on my main screen yesterday for sure, though since this was a quick hotfix some people who didn't play yesterday may have missed it.
---
I'll sell you some if you want to pick which mutations you wanna keep
---
Yes it’s not a terribly effective weapon but it’s fun to use.
---
The whole point of the Biv quests as well as a lot of the daily challenges lately is basically to give some ‘busy work’. I’m actually ok with that. I’ve been feeling a bit bored with the game lately and the quests that require some traveling and exploring at least give me something to do. I’d rather have to travel for some ingredients than the stupid ‘level up 12 times while naked and spinning on your head’ dailies - those are so annoying.
---
Hmmmmm
---
No ;)
---
I think he was just pointing out that your Japanese is pretty girly.
---
Wait do you mean like a board or a junk piece of wood that somehow has a legendary effect?
---
In all honesty, it's not a huge deal IMO for two main reasons: 5mm ammo is so cheap and the Gatling has a slow firing rate, and as soon as I see an enemy I will start firing before even aiming and never stop because of that perk that increases DR while firing heavy weapons.
---
You can cripple their legs rather easy though. Gutsys have three weapon arms to take out to make them stop firing. They are still the only enemy I worry about in groups.
---
how is it not a spoiler?  I was fully expecting to see a sheepsquatch at the end until I skimmed my timeline...
---
My girlfriend is always asking me why I don’t use marsupial and while my view isn’t quite as extreme as yours, I can definitely see where you’re coming from. It’s just such a stupid addition.
---
I've tried this, it doesn't always work, it's just as selective as every other little trick I've tried.
---
Nobody writes 貴女 for あなた in Japan except weebs and fags like you. That's enough to say.
---
since you last sold something?   for example yesterday i sold for 1000 caps, this morning for 400 caps, i can't imagine that i would have to wait for 20 hours since selling the last 400 caps?
---
I don't know, moving us slowly towards a system where it's almost impossible to earn more than a handful of the Atom Caps. Or even worse, moving us towards a system where we can earn them but only by devoting far too much playtime towards the task. That's when people start thinking 'I'd rather just pay'.
---
It's 20 hours here in Europe.
---
Yeah but should the people doing the maintence Do a night shift just for your stupid ass? Iam also from germany but fuck your thinking
---
Maybe a stealth/sneak build running naked with chameleon mutation?
---
sux you're getting downvoted, I don't understand what is so hard for people to comprehend here...  I was fully expecting to see a sheepsquatch at the end of the quest, the only way I should've found out it wasn't in the game yet is through the quest.
---
Same.  I didn't experience it much (though my initial builds had little power).  I did some rewiring a couple weeks ago and ran into this for the first time consistently.
---
I don't know why, but if I ran into this, and started the wire from the other object, I never jumped..
---
Bethesda are located in the US, they’re obviously going to schedule their updates based on what’s most convenient for their local time zone.
---
So is glowing meat, especially if you cook it
---
no, just that I won't see one at the end of the quest, that was spoiled by having this knowledge...
---
Good point. Does the sight actually improve accuracy stats at all? I can't remember. If it does, maybe this is actually an intentional design.
---
I sell a certain craftable item. It’s very easy to make and gets a decent amount of caps. Can’t say what it is or it’ll see the same fate as the civil war top hat.
---

---
I'm on ps4 and so far so good. Can get a bit laggy at times, but I've been playing since a week after launch. If you mean buying. I also have a US account in addition to my Asian one.
---
I was having fun and making a killing lol still fun now that but high risk feeling is gone 
---
And I’m not a hardcore griefer, but tbh the og survival mode was the best way for me to make caps, and I’m not completely specced for pvp either. Since the nerf and given my week experience in survivor mode, all I can say is that adventure mode workshop defense events have never looked more inviting... stay on ur guard if ur over level 100 and planning on claiming / defending your shop is all
---
Oh i misunderstood!  
---
I like taking over a few workshops as well, the caps i spend taking over comes back in many times over plus it's no limit like with vendors

The tech data bug happened to me this morning. Traded in last night. Logged on this morning and had the tech data again. Took it back and traded it. I also had a tech data file on the floor by my camp which wont let me pick it up. Sure that file has been appearing on and off for a few weeks though.
---
Wholesome
---
I've been having pretty good luck, I guess.  Of course I got a wooden leg or two, but so far I've also gotten a 3-star gatling laser with bad effects, and these [two](https://imgur.com/ylPlJ7O) [pieces](https://imgur.com/fYhbALe) that I thought were worth trying to sell.
---
Yea mine done the same last night for death claw gauntlet and attaching the third claw. It’s been ticketed to Bethesda by many people. Hopefully a fix soon!
---
Apparently from what the dataminer said, and from the list I saw, there's supposed to be a event called Free Range, which you have to protect a pack of brahmin, and the boss was going to be the real sheepsqautch. Apparently both of them are ticked off. (This event, I assume it would be from this event, it would have sheepsquatch items, like plans, meat, weapons, etc.)
---
last night i had 5 crashes/freezes
---
Serverhop at Lucky Hole Mine, if there are ants outside, then there are ants inside as well. Other good places are the subpower stations in the Mire and Watoga.
---
Or if you mean you don't have Ant Lager, then you should do Biv's dailies to get bottles or the recipe or buy from players, try the market subreddit for example. But yeah that can be a pain.
---
This is girly too, dude.
---
I run bloodied melee, the ability to jump on top of something away from a swarm of enemies, like say, glowing ones in a nuked white springs has saved my ass numerous times. Plus the extra carry weight is great too.
---
yep....that's why I never use it.  I just stick to wires and the rug trick.
---
Awesome!
---
If something pops up on the Atom store that I want I'll buy it, and if I don't have enough Atoms, I'll buy Atmos. Probably spent $100 AUD on them since they came out to get stuff I want.
---
Honestly, I, and probably plenty of others with disposable income, am fine with spending money to get stuff I want in games. I don't consider it any different than spending money on a monthly subscription to Amazon Prime or Netflix to be able to watch the shows I want to watch. Still getting enjoyment out of it.
---
You don’t even need to say that you are from Japan, when you say nice to meet you at the beginning. We know you can’t be from any where else.
---
It definitely is
---
They are putting out a fix today so hopefully this is included since it is a pretty big glitch.
---
I don't mind my name, I think I'll keep it for a while
---
the_dabman710
---
I have a bloodied fat man that is actually very useful. It sat in my stash for a long time until I used it for PvP just for fun. Not the best, but over 1200 dmg (highest I've gotten it with just perks) in a huge area makes spamming it against snipers pretty fun.
---
And the new event, I just sit on the shack roof and wipe the robots as soon as they spawn while everyone fights the sheep.
---
Fat man really needs a buff though.....
---
Haha. I'll be heading back someday, but with my luck they'll change server maintenance to night times.
---
I am just as confused
---
My Instigating Hunting Rifle is Dante (after Dante's Inferno) because my character's a Fire Breather and I wanted to the theme going, and my Dragon is The BFG because *no shit*.
---
I agree and, in particular, miss the planters from Fallout 4 and the ability to place plants inside structures/buildings as opposed to only outside and in the ground.
---
Similarly to some of the other folks here I realize implementing this in Fallout 76 may pose some additional challenges, but, I'd welcome the addition.
---
Thre is a lot of salt in this thread even tho op has a legit post. Just last night watched 3 guys in full assassin sent just spamming jump and murdering everything while never being scratched. All the while most of the server attacking them and their kill counts going over 20 each. 
---
Regardless of all your get good comments that's not balance or even close to it. It also is just dumb that something like that is the pvp meta. Get gear and jump in place in groups while sniping people with a shotgun.
---
Aside from that the map is too big and it's too difficult to find other players to fight. There are no mechanics that are driving players to the same locations so you end up fighting see few people over and over or no one at all. The game mode needs a lot of work.
---
Thank you for your advice and encouragement.
---
Anyway, I will try to keep sending emails to Bethesda.jp patiently
---
I felt it was the best way.
---
Also, I am really grateful that so many people answered my poor English sentences.
---
Although this problem will not be solved soon, I think that I would like to report here when it is so.
---
Your comments were really encouraging. Thank you very much.
---
貴女は /s って意味わからないのか~？
---
日本語でどうぞ
---
Odd, have not been able to replicate, hoping some more people will pop in and give us some more info
---
my head hurts
---
Well the initial connector you attach a wire to would still use the jump button, that I haven't had an issue with. It's when you have the wire active and you're trying to connect it to a second connector. 
---
For that small part I suggest that instead of "Attach/Secure Wire" being bound to the same button as jump, it is instead bound to "Interact" which is greyed out and unusable when you're in the middle of trying to attach a wire. This would be able to translate to both PC and console just fine.
---
An interesting point which lends credit to my theory that it's intentionally designed this way, and the sights just add a few points of accuracy stats (I think?). But to play devil's advocate for a sec, why can't the sight just be moved/rotated to line up properly? Sure it's not "officially" how the gun is but, I mean, we can make pipe guns from scratch and all kinds of crazy things - rotating a brass ring around the barrel base/mount would be a trivial job in comparison.
---
If I have one in my inventory upon loading into a server it spawns one at my feet. It was also doing this with other quest items. You have some when you logged off?
---
Hmmm. Sounds like a dick move. No thanks.
---
Your tip is to not help during the event and steal from those who died trying to help during the event?
---
Honestly? I never worried about "builds".. My main stats are Strength and Int. Just because they help me build and carry stuff.. Each level I crab the card that seems most "useful"..
---
o
---
あほか?明らかに分かるだろう。消え失せろ。
---
Is it something that's banned in Japan from being able to purchase?  I can't imagine why Bethesda wouldn't give you the option if it was legal there.
---
Exactly. Place pylons on rugs or conduits on small signs, attach them to the power source, move them once where everything is still green, then move them a second time to anywhere you want. Through walls, ceilings, floors, even through solid ground. It’s currently the best way to power every part of your build and can look very clean if the pylons/conduits are placed right.
---
Yikes! Lololol
---
So with the walls the best bet is to use a joint connection, and have the end just overlapping where the wall will be, you can then place the wall AFTER you place the conduit and then connect the other conduit on the other side   
---
Example +--|--+    
---
It is clunky but works once you modify yourself to the mechanic you can also use an upper and lower connection to pass power between floors and mix and match with wires.
---
confused why mine is being capped at 30fps at 4k then, Cause looking at the floor only brings 30 fps.
---
わあああああぁ～～　アニメだい好きですですです
---
This was a good laugh, almost spit my coffee too
---
I'll have to give that a go. I was just making and  selling  top hats, but apparently they got nerfed pretty severely.
---
REpair and mod functionality I bet.
---
I was honestly pretty bummed on the rewards from Lying Lowe.  &gt;!The Fixer rifle could have been very cool, but without some sort of damage boost, there is absolutely no reason to use it over a random lootgen single star anti-armor combat rifle.  If it added +50% sneak attack damage, that would be very, very good.!&lt;
---
Bethesda don't have europe department? Uh. Blizzard had?
---
I hope this is a feature they add with the legendary vendor. I have a few guns that would be perfect if they weren't one level below max.
---
...all. the. cats.
---
I use it to add greebles to my builds exclusively. Pipes and stuff. Just for decoration.
---
Yes, this and also still have to exit build menu due to the "nothing is selected" bug is still happening. Thanks
---
I have no problem with downvotes. I just hope more people will voice their opinion on this matter.
---
The patch notes said that glowing enemies are now instanced:   No hit, no loot.
---
Agreed. Also, when laying the conduit, they do not lie straight, so you cannot get it to run neatly along the wall. Your idea of snapping corner pieces would solve this 
---
And we should be able to run conduit on the outside of a wall instead of just the inside face. For that matter, we should be able to run it along the wall, period. 
---
The vertical conduits that exist should also have an S curve version so that I can connect an upper horizontal conduit to a lower horizontal one without making it a loop. I raised the conduit off of the floor because it looks terrible (since I couldn't get it close to the wall). But I couldn't put the wall to my generator room up unless the conduit was on the floor. So I had to drop the conduit down to the floor and make a swirl to get it into the generator closet.
---
6. Fire at the sheep while also keeping a look out for more plsyers that die..
---
There you go...
---
Did the same for me with mutations serums.
---
Okay so the person who said they got it from a bivs daily was making it up.
---
Now you’re all doing PvP lolz
---
Biggest dick of the day award goes to you
---
Looks like the bomber jacket
---
This means its in your inventory, just hidden, go complete the quest or check your stash it was bugging me until I just went and completed it.
---
Smells oddly troll like in here today.
---
I think the issue is less about mtx as a whole and more about adding pay to win after explicitly stating the atom shop would be cosmetic only.
---
I do not care for overpriced mtx in full price games, something fo76 unfortunately is near the head of the pack with this practice. With that said, I also will just not spend money on them and go on with my life if everything is cosmetic.  
---
I have a larger issue when they start introducing items that directly impact gameplay and only make them available with premium currency, that is dipping toes into pay to win and going back on what was already clearly stated.  Not a good look imo, and this sentiment doesn't apply just to fo76, but in general
---
Yeah I've been trying to build a new camp and half way through I get disconnected and have to start all over  again
---
The problem is the community dose care. Fist of all they could have spent their time actually working on anything else. Again the point is if what you say is as it is. They are simply using this as a vehicle to piss on the community. I’m not sure that’s a healthy approach to maintaining a healthy customer base.
---
Since when was a law logical or fully thought out?
---
Stay on cod zombies
---
Wow, thanks I will try that and report when and if I have success. That could be interesting.
---
Well, hoping to be crafting various things really.
---
But using your PA for 4k as an example.
---
* What suit is it?
---
* Did you or the Customer supply the Mats
---
* Does it include Mods (Calibrated/ Motion assist etc)
---
* Does "lvl" count?
---
The weaons they award you i survival are solid.  Not as good as one found in the wild,  but stil good. I would like to see more of those though for sure.
---
It's ok Grahm. Mine does too.
---
If E is "Interact" it shouldn't even be functional when you're in the middle of trying to connect a wire. That's why I'm proposing it officially be changed to that for when you have to make the second connection.
---
Ricochet perk is quite helpful in these situations...not perfect but better than nothing.
---
Found a new note in the cliffside mansion north of Monogaugh. So there’s definitely new stuff scattered throughout. 
---
Not sure about this safe but there are new notes to find that may lead to something or be related to the quests
---
Vampiric Primed Gatling Gun. I could tank the SBQ with my face and the Medic torso almost never has to activate...
---
Completely agree and it's nice to know I'm not the only one who uses the Gatling for both short and long range haha. Yes they should just remove the sights and rename/redesign it to something else (assuming the sight increases accuracy stats, which I can't remember right now).
---
Imagine USA banning microtransactions.
---
Betha patched it so they don't stack no matter how many you get its always one, if you are one of the lucky ones with some still stacked in your stash remember to only pull one out at a time.
---
May be needed for the lag/staggering that makes game unplayable !
---
&gt; あほか?明らかに分かるだろう。消え失せろ。 Edit: 死ね、魔法使い。
---
_This_ is your retort, seriously? I see why you hear anime in everything.
---
Oh that sounds awesome! Thanks for the response
---
It has been demonstrated on YouTube that nuking one's camp does nothing but wreck the crops.
---
Before level 25 when you can get Excavator power armor, put some points in Pack Rat (besides Bandolier, it's the only strength perk I use). As others have said, Pharma Farma is also excellent for making sure you have plenty of stims. Also, don't pick up everything unless you actually need it for something specific (e.g. CAMP building, ammo making, etc.). Until I got the Excavator, I split my time making resource scrounging runs and questing/event/exploring runs. I would sometimes fast travel to an area fairly close to a train station so I could scavenge, get really over encumbered, and scrap and stash there without walking for miles (think Morgantown and Charleston). Even though I only play for \~6 hours a week on weekends, I still do scavenge-only runs when needed (still get XP for fighting off enemies in my way though). Thing is, I enjoy it, and put up with things like inventory management, simply because I enjoy being in the Fallout world. Do I wish I could use unlimited carry weight cheats like I did in Fallout 4? Hell yes, but this is multiplayer and if that means added tedium to some extent, it's a very small price to pay for exploring Appalachia.
---
PS4. I always am in pacifist mode, or at least I thought I was.
---
Manage to have this happen with my LMG, went through 3,000 rounds in about 15 minutes, it fired 10'ish shots and then reloaded, however consumed ALL 75 rounds in the weapon.
---
Documenting and reporting
---
Guessing that's part of why servers are down. My calibrated shocks need to be ON my PA to be effective :)
---
I play with people in my house, two copies, 2 xboxes and both have their own gold accounts.
---
Maybe it’s a maturity model?
---
As in future patches and enhancements?
---
We finally got to rename items so..?
---
How did you launch the Nuke at level 27? Absolutely no way you cleared a silo solo so I’m guessing you had some high level help, your own fault for not enjoying the rest of the game and just being pushed through a silo. Seriously why would you? I’m level 136 and I have yet to launch a Nuke, haven’t even wanted to yet.
---
I've gotten three 3-star drops in maybe 6-7 completions.  Of course I got the wooden leg on one run, but I farm legendaries a lot so maybe I'm used to it.
---
good to know, thanks
---
BTW was it a non-Legendary Syringer?
---
cry me a river
---
Thank you lol can't believe OP has a problem with people who don't like the reversal. The Menu Nazi over there
---
Maybe the 4 and 5 star stuff will be mods like the sacrificial blade. Just a guess.
---
yeah you will drop a couple things on load, tech data and some keys normally, they are null items and cant be picked up just representations of things in your stash or inventory just turn it in again and it will go away its just the server being silly.
---
I like the part where you don't realize it's written that way to insult you.
---
but you shouldn't have to, the point of the keyring is to avoid that to keep a concise inventory and it's existed since fo3
---
I’m on pc, whats your twitch
---
&gt;I absolutely refuse to run marsupial (optimized bloodied build) 
---
Well, here come the down votes from the bloodied Kangaroo cult.   Have an up vote from me though.
---
While you're not wrong; it also makes no sense for you not to be able to plant certain crops based on locational awareness similar to how your camp is aware of any sort of resource node around you and changes your extractor types based on that.
---
Do you have a water body in your camp? You now have access to: Tarberries, Snaptail, Bloodleaf, etc.
---
Expand the crops similarly. Or even expand on already existing ingame items; want pumpkins? Do the Pumpkin House daily to get the radioactive pumpkin seeds that allow you to plant 'normal' pumpkin crops.
---
In the case of plants that we don't entirely know the growing conditions of, AKA: mostly all fungal plants. Make us craft grow boxes that limit both the output potential and the amount of boxes per camp. That means someone who wants to have a base dedicated to medicine now can. They can choose to dedicate say 2/5 grow boxes towards firecaps, 1/5 to glow fungus, and 2/5 brain fungus. 
---
Leave the exceptionally rare 'crops' either out of the pool or make them tied to recipes learned from events and make them have a high creation cost to offset their rarity. For instance; make non-diseased cranberries a think. Make the cranberries their own special crop box with the plans coming from the Scorch Beast Queen and requiring a combination of stable flux and other rare/uncommon materials. Or add the Mothman eggs; similarly requiring flux and mothman parts, meaning you now have a reason to hunt the Mothman cryptid. 
---
You can also add other craftable sources for things you'd want. Such as a frog nest for eggs and limbs, other animal products and pens, a tick 'nest' for blood production for the medically inclined, so on and so forth.
---
I don't watch. Nice to see you switch to English when someone replies in Japanese.
---
What is your point, exactly? You're talking about hip-fired guns, but the topic is how the sights don't line up in ADS mode. Are you actually saying they should remove the sights, fix the alignment of the ADS sight, or leave the sights as-is (and confuse everyone about the function of "sights" on the weapon)?
---
Any game that came out after August 2018 wouldn't have any issues with re naming
---
There's another update? How big is the update size? It doesn't show up on my console that is has an update
---
If this is the most effective way for you sell that 1400 caps a day I have one word for you...
---
Noooooooob
---
lol rekt
---
Do you think the wanted bounty would follow me across modes? I'd be up to run through survival after I stick all of my stimpacks in my stash.
---
&gt; Edit: fixed for grammarfæg
---
I like the part where you make fun of someone for trying to engage with OP directly but need to fix your own anime Japanese because you fucked up the grammar the first time.
---
The protectrons I cripple with vats at the legs and shins.
---
Hadn’t considered doing the same to assaultrons
---
I just killed someone right before the servers shut down because I saw them hiding in a bush with a yellow microphone over their head. 
---
Is 15 minutes ago a while?
---
PS4 too, maybe they'll fix not being able to fast travel to your camp...I had to fast travel to a nearby town because it wouldn't let me go to my camp. Anyone else have this issue?
---
I've done it 3 times and gotten 2 3* drops and one 2* drop. This game is ridiculously random.
---
Fair enough.

Type “Nukes &amp; Dragons” into google and use their character builder to test what you like. I’ve provided a link to a sample PVE gunslinger build. But tbh, there are only a few weapon types that allow you to deal with super mutants without struggling. Instigating snipers with sneak Damage, AAE/BE Explosive weapons, and instigating/bloodied melee. Without end game weapons you’ll still be struggling, even at lvl 100.
---

Nah, 3 within 30 minutes: [https://youtu.be/fmjl6HMk8vs](https://youtu.be/fmjl6HMk8vs) ;)
---
That doesn't really sound like a bad award...
---
First, I have no proof that this is why they did it this way. But I would be quite amused if they did. Chances are, they aren't trying to piss off the community. 
---
Yes, the community cares.
---
But the community does not all care about the same thing. 
---
The community thinks their issues are the most important. Every one else's issues are not important. 
---
But there was literally no way they could have done this without someone getting upset that they listened to one segment of the community over the other. 
---
And you are proving that. I'm not saying you are wrong. Im just saying you didn't like this. Others did.
---
Tell me who's right?
---
I have a skill mag that increase bleed out time. I'll be using that next time.
---
The MIRV is likely just saying that each Mini Nuke is smaller, but spreading them out so you get a bigger destructive area. Unfortunately, the damage is actually lower, since unless you're near a few of the MIRV explosions you don't get the full blast of the individual ones.  However, it's probably good for just really giving a lot of things in the area a bad day.
---
Lol, it's all good, thanks hombre. The idea that marsupial is somehow appropriate for a Fallout game is absolutely indefensible, as proven by how NOBODY will be able to formulate an even remotely coherent rebuttal as to why it is.
---
What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent post were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this sub is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no up-votes, and may God have mercy on your soul.
---
Thanks for spoiling the fact that there’s new content /s
---
I mean, I have no doubt they plan on adding stuff to the game, and hopefully they do, it just seems like they didn't even think about other players when they added the syringer
---
It's amazing that people aren't comprehending the Sheepsquatch event is for cosmetics and plans, not legendaries.
---
&gt;Must defend video game at all costs! No flaws! No flaws!
---
Would love it but would require probably a pond to do it at like large water purifier or maybe we can something cool like hydroponics that we can grow not just tarberries inside our homes but other veggies too.
---
I has a sad.  I kind of liked it that way.
---
People have been asking for 3* legendaries to drop 3* loot forever, this event is no exception.  Even then - to get a good 3* is still pretty rare when you start counting all of the different items and stat combos.
---
Good thing this event has a cap gate so there is some slight slow down with it being farmed indefinitely.
---
Welcome to live games a service. You must be new to online gaming.
---
As opposed to OP's scenario the times I have done the event so far was with a bunch of random players that kindly decided to turn up because with an army of me, being bloodied/unyielding 'n all, I was faring pretty poorly.
---
I did suggest 'go home and do not come back until you are in full 'end game' regalia and fully mutated' but they replied 'how about you go *something something your mum* instead?' so Robotics Expert it was.
---
Luckily it worked quite nicely and everyone got their flare guns, and wood armor - apparently my mum something something wood as well - and even a drill I have heard, a drill! man one can hope, but either way we got the stuff done and happily ever after.
---
"Locate the mysterious Purveyor to exchange and scrap your unwanted legendary items for new legendary gear. For every star rating on a legendary item you scrap, increase your chances to get the legendary weapon or armor of your dreams."
---
Found on the roadmap page. It talks about destroying weapons, not rerolling current ones. Meanwhile Todd doesn't really seem to be that in touch with the dev team, so I trust what the actual team wrote over what Todd said. Especially considering he has a lot more on his plate than just fo76.
---
What do you mean by actual legendary drops?
---
But what if you throw orbital scan beacons or otherwise mark the 'Squatch? I can consistently just keep hammering away at it even when cloaked, and it has saved the event a few times when we killed it with just seconds to spare....
---
Even a guaranteed 3 star doesn't make it worth paying 1700 caps to start the event. This will be dead when people run out of the cards they got in the quest
---
Twin Boys- two-shot 50% crit fat boy
---
Twin Suns- two-shot 50% crit missile launcher (the two missile exhausts look like two angry suns chasing you down)
---
Cricket- two-shot .44 revolver. Carried mostly for the recon scope on it. 
---
Rambo- bloodied 50cal. More appropriate if it was a Quad, 1000 round mag fits Rambo best, but there’s a lot of blood in Rambo movies too. 
---
Flamburger- bloodied Shishkebab. Pun on Flamberge.
---
Leatherface’s Handy- bloodied 50% limb damage Ripper. It’s a handy little chainsaw. Ya dig?
---
Bloodsucker- Vampiric LMG. Sucker shoots fast, sucks a lot of health.
---
Cap’n Ahab- bloodied, barbed, scoped Harpoon Gun. My “sniper rifle”. Self-explanatory. 
---
Instigator- Instigating 25% fire rate Gatling Gun. Not my favorite gun, but my daily carry due to it’s ammo/repair efficiency on most trash mobs (1-shot status, very accurate, fires relatively fast)
---
There's a event from what I heard is currently ticked off that is supposed to have the real deal. Hopefully during this maintenance they tick it on so we can actually do it.
---
Wasn't actually sure what all the drops were, but it is a difficult event that lower levels can participate in easier than the SBQ fight, so maybe a crappy 2\* is attractive enough for many.  I can't recall ever getting anything of significance from the Queen either, got 90% of my best stuff from Whitesprings, but I still love the challenge of beating her when I can.
---
It's great for any range really, even against melee guys with the perk that increases DR while firing heavy weapons. That's the fantastic thing about the Gatling - you can maintain constant fire and preserve that DR for longer than any other heavy weapon. It's the best weapon of choice for tanking.
---
No i dont have any mods.
---
You’re arguing in and about japanese in a Fallout subreddit. You guys are both losers. Wash the fucking dorito stains off your hands and go outside for fucks sake man.
---
I can't wait to plant a few rows of radodendrons.
---
😭😭😭
---
This guy got a drill. Most people did not get a drill and got actual legendaries
---
What you are saying could make more sense as to why they might think a longer cooldown to be needed than anything else I've heard or said and I hadn't even considered the price of the cards could play into that theory as well.  Good point.
---
Just vats it man, even if your build has zero investment in vats stuff you need to shoot like once or twice in vats and you have &gt;90% accuracy at point blank.
---
That does make since, but it's fairly difficult and the rewards should represent that, of course it's not worthy of god tier loot, but a one star legendary leather leg isn't worth the trouble.
---
But what do you mean by check lewisburg for them I’ve run the event countless times but no one gathers there afterwards. Is there something I’m missing?
---
Ive got a two shot explosve faster reload one, interested?
---
Just go play...if your still confused after that then go watch some YouTube.  these post really blow me away, I don't understand them.  It's a fallout game, you know what to expect.
---
I switched to English because it's obviously your stronger language based on that mangled manga-speak.
---
You might want to delete this? I get spam messages now I assume from once posting my I'd on reddit
---
TSE\*
---
You care to make me one? Really want a level 50 one but I don't want to have to farm the event to have a chance to get the plan.
---
Can you post a photo of that?
---
I'm not trying to be a dick at all, but stick around for a while. Get to the point where the majority of your time in-game is spent farming legendaries, trying to find a single specific combination of legendary effects that synergize with your build.   
---
Revisit this thread 500 gameplay hours from now.
---
I have had a lot of success with them actually. I use the ceiling ones and as long as they are lined up they snap right to each other and go through the wall no problem. If you are on PS4 i’d be happy to help!
---
Wait you can put the artifact on a radium rifle?
---
This is helpful, thanks!
---
Haha yeah I usually pull out my Grognak axe for them, but they can be frustratingly quick. Friggin' hate roaches IRL already, they're just as annoying in Fallout!
---
There will be a lot of opinions, so here’s mine:
---
1. Pick what kind of weapon you want to specialize in, melee, rifle/sniper, heavy guns etc. Take perks and points to up the damage for that weapon as they become available. You won’t have a new one every level. 
---
2. Take whatever else keeps you alive in the beginning, you can perfect your build later. Having trouble with food? Take a perk to reduce hunger or find more. Getting overencumbered? Take a weight perk.
---
3. Perfect your build after level 50. The perks you need in the early game are different than what you need at the end when your base damage and health are higher, and you have much better gear. 
---
4. Be patient. At early levels, this game is much harder than others in the series—at least for most players. Enjoy that sense of danger while it lasts, eventually you’ll fear nothing.
---
I think 3* legendaries should drop 3* loot guaranteed, but I believe the loot pools should be different. The queen and sheep are the only 2 "bosses" in the game for us, therefore should drop better quality plans and or gear. Having killed the queen an unknown number of times (40-60?) I've been disappointed MANY times. A 3* wooden leg or a 3* crossbow is of little value to me or most of the market i could even trade to. Lets tighten the pool to make it more worthwhile.
---
Two shot still works on the explosive launchers.
---
The explosion from the 2nd projectile still does its damage. The stat screen just doesn’t show it.
---
Compare your two shot fat man vs a normal one on an enemy and you’ll see the difference. I did this with missile launchers and my two shot outperformed my anti armor one.
---
Also I noticed the same thing about the MIRV damage being the same on a level 35 or 45. Which makes it worth putting on a level 35 if you also have a level 45 to keep standard
---
lol Pacify the adds, sounds exhausting there are SO many of em.
---
And how is He in the Trailer then?
---
I should have added, I'd prefer not to use letters, not just z. Still helpful, thanks!
---
Give this guy his raider flair next to the user name.
---
Mine worked fine until the game kicked me from the main menu for AFK, now it says
---
Login failed. This account lacks the required entitlements. [4:8:2006]
---
Lol that sounds so broken!
---
Weird that I've never noticed until now.
---
I just realized I might have turned off when I went to check out the survival mode... Whoops.
---
I would like to do this, but I don't really follow.  
---
So you have your generator.  You want to go through a wall, to the outside.  Do you place the conduit on a sign inside or out?   Once connected you can just move it and place it anywhere?
---
Power connections is one of the areas I really struggle with.
---
It's made me realize how much of the stuff I sell on my vendor runs I was actually collecting on my vendor runs.
---
It's like checking Watoga station after a queen fight, hit or miss. I have my house right there and check it every time
---
&gt; Yes All Rise does great damage, but a hammer with armor piercing and faster swing speed will outclass it completely. 
---
That 90% weight reduction though. Hard to beat for a hammer swinger.
---
I have a bloodied Fatman that is absolutely devastating
---
i do agree that the bosses all need to be guaranteed legendary 3 star. but for the Sheep squach one once you use your card you have to wait for someone else to get the card.. or craft a new one by spending about 2K Caps for the board needed.
---
the Queen in general needs much better loot
---
Have over 80 wood legendaries if your ever in the mood to take a peek at my wood
---
Is it actually that good? My one melee weapon for those encounters is a Grognak axe with +20% damage to robots, it's been great for tanking Assaultrons.
---
Yeah... if your title is "Liberty Prime meets his match vs fifty foot tall chem using protectron in new DLC... massive spoilers ahead!" you pretty much blew your load already.
---
It's just odd that only Beth's currency would fall under it, and not those of other games
---
What about a confirmation before either 'dropping'....!?
---
I'd rather they be on top of server maintenance and hotfixes than not updating for like a month or weeks at a time, tbh.
---
I mean you become a glass cannon, one sideways fart and your taking a dirt nap it has a pretty large downside as well, any rad weapons will stretch out your bunghole faster than a trip to the local penitentiary.
---
"Locate the mysterious Purveyor to exchange and scrap your unwanted legendary items for new legendary gear. For every star rating on a legendary item you scrap, increase your chances to get the legendary weapon or armor of your dreams." 
---
Found on the road map page.
---
Thanks, documented and reported!
---
No! You're what's wrong with gaming these days! Stop having fun, and don't you dare spend your own money on it!
---
Ah ok thanks!
---
The only time you should be shooting it while cloaked is if you notice it’s going for a pylon player.
---
Can’t argue with that
---
That's pretty much it other than the 4 side quests you get from the poster inside the taxidermy shop.
---
...Why would you buy atoms lol
---
You condescending racist fuck. He made an effort to post in English. And his English was better than your Japanese. But you decided to n2 flex anyway.
---
I fixed before your repost, and mentioned it the edit because I knew you'd nitpick it, before it was brought up.
---
&gt; got a 1 star cloaking wood piece.
---
If it is left arm, I'll take it. Got a sniper that needs an arm to complete the ensemble.
---
Same.  Thought I was the only one.  I have it constantly and it's really affecting performance for me.  It's nearly gotten me killed a dozen times.
---
How do you star those?
---
thank you for posting this.   
---
do you have images of the helm?
---
A myth, that was datamined to be in game, which also drops meat, and horns, that also has a brand of sheepsquatch weapons which I assume you can make from plans, that have mods to them. Also a event called Free Range, which the sheepsquatch is supposed to be the boss of it. Yet only a myth.
---
I've always felt that 3* legendaries dropping 1* loot was acceptable, it is always thrilling to find a 3* to kill and get a roll. I think if they dropped guaranteed 3* they would be less fun to find and Bethesda would need to reduce the percentage of times that you find one.
---
With that said.........
---
It's obvious that Bethesda nerfed the legendary spawn rate in the last update (Watoga I'm looking at you). With a nerfed spawn rate the drops should be guaranteed 3*.
---
Start*
---
&gt;In my experience with this game, the only people who PvP at workshops are just looking to one shot another player for caps. 
---
Which is why turrets should be inescapable and have the ability to one shot anyone who fucks with it.
---
Lol I put my camp on a mountain overlooking the whitespring just so I can artillery strike the camps at the whitespring and the ones at the lake
---
Not really, depends on the build I guess? I am very very sneaky and for me is fairly easy, barely an inconvenience.
---
Following it as well, sigh, all I wanna do is shoot a Robot who thinks its a sheep monster damnit....

---
Ya but you can’t damage the Sheepsquatch when it’s cloaked...
---
Unfortunately no, haven’t gotten it yet, I’ve gotten the mascot head though, and the fixer plans
---
Okay, I’ll bite. 
---
If mutations (fev included) can change you into a super strong green genderless power house who is relatively impervious to physical damage (fallout 1 - present)... why can’t it give you super strong legs for vertical propulsion? 
---
I think it’s fine to dislike it, or feel it’s out of place. I tend to agree. Though people who do enjoy it are not dumb or "not real fans", lol.
---
Me too ... I was wondering what the heck in the post this comment had to do with.  lol
---
There's a poster inside the taxidermy shop that has a map and sting lines to photos or something. Each photo you click on gives you a side quest.
---
If we could see them, traders could put a lvl 5 gun but give the title of legendary
---
Well, presumably using the same character model that the data-miners found in the game's files, both used in order to confuse people.
---
 If not for wanting to see what the hotfix today is about I would be avoiding this place till I finished the content for that exact reason.
---
What platform are you on
---
Oh ok. Thanks
---
Nope
---
Yes, will be on tonight same time 7pm
---
Have no problem finding it when cloaked, it tends to be always right infront of me murdering me. 
---
My .50cal explosive can do real damage to it, but i only fire at it if it is right infront of me. I accept that i will die so i go in close and walk backwards while firing.
---
Think its permanent
---
Why not have the quests items themselves scale with your level? Then if you complete it at a higher level, it matches your level. Then there is no constant upgrading and not searching for new weapons.
---
Yes, the quest is the direct buildup into the event.
---
It's completely gross. Other games that want to sell you stuff for real money do this, division 2 is a great example. If I've found parts of an outfit, the outfit pack is cheaper. They breakdown what each item in the bundle costs and if you have the item they simply subtract its value from the rest. It's the way things like this should be done
---
Yeah I got the event yesterday. Ironically my game crashed before I found the horde.
---
No problem!
---
Confirmed. It happens going either way.
---
&gt;The workshops is a game mechanism created to give players a thing to fight over. Making it impossible to take would destroy the mechanisms goal.
---
There's weapons in the game who can one shot you in PVP.   Missile turrets set up in workshops should do the same thing to anyone who fucks with it. 
---
I'm sick of this idea of  "I can have armor that makes me unkillable and a weapon that kills players in one shot, but workshop defenses have to give me a fair chance to take it."   
---
'
---
It was announced on Twitter yesterday, might be a good idea to follow the socials of the things you're currently enjoying on a daily basis. Yes i understand it would've been better for it to be an ingame notification, not sure why they didn't.
---
In other words false advertisment
---
You could sell it, think it goes for a couple thousand caps, as long as you don't sell it over the price the vendor bots sell it for that is.
---
Right, just hit tab once and try again, always works on the second try.
---
Pos
---
I feel ya, it is complicated. 
---
So in your scenario, you would first place the sign within sight of your generator and put the conduit on it. So if your generator is inside, put it there. Connect a wire from the generator to the conduit. Now you have to move the whole thing once (sign, conduit, and attached wire) to another spot the wire is able to go. I usually just move it like an inch to the right or something small like that. Once this is done, the game treats the sign/conduit/wire as something that will stay connected now no matter where you place the sign after this point. So yeah, once it’s connected and has been moved once, you can move it anywhere.
---
It takes some practice but it’s very convenient. You can also connect multiple things to one conduit this way no matter what rooms they’re in. Just remember to move everything slightly once after connecting a wire, then anywhere you want
---
Your calling me a noob when you are the 1 assuming im selling junk to an npc vendor....  WHO does that???
---
You can do this at sbq event as well if you want. It's a bit pathetic though, we're not all noobs.
---
In some way, this may be seen as positive. Like a dangerous jobs, on the docs, at midnight... no one is your friend...
---
But it\`s surely a hassle if youre not waiting for things like this to happen. I think I\`ve got lucky, in 20 events, only this one happened to get trolled, and another one had a PK killing players randomly.
---
To the right person, maybe!
---
I've already bought most of the plans from Phoenix, so getting a T-60 Jetpack or Shocks plan really is kick to the face haha
---
wtf is n2 flex?  and since when is it "racist" to use a shared language? Him posting in English to reach a wider audience in no way precludes other people from posting back to him. It's not "racist", it's "friendly", you freak.
---
If you don't want to be nitpicked, don't make fun of people for something you're not good at yourself.
---
Maybe. I'm assuming it's going to be an atom shop item, with there being a camp bar bundle to buy. I've done bivs dailies from the start, got all the recipes but no keg plan.
---
https://i.gyazo.com/398080b4b6c40bf7fa8497d70e2746ee.png they are aware of the bug of not being able to attach mods and told me to just wait till next patch to see if they fix it
---
All mods are screwed up since the update Tuesday.
---
Wow a discovery picking death bags yield loot hahaha 
---
Try this on survival In top of all their stuff you get to keep some aid lol
---
I am betting their is another part to the quest that hasn’t been released yet.
---
Revenant
---
Good thing it's not an Impostor Sheepsquatch Horde. One hits like a truck and has a ton of health, 3 or 4 attacking a workshop. Motherf*****, keep it.
---
Mods are broken at the moment, hopefully they are fixed in the patch today.
---
Nope. The amount of perk points/cards in any category stays the same when effected by mutation, disease, foods/chems, whatever. It will only change how your character interacts in the world. Lower intelligence makes hacking harder. Drink a beer, you gain some strength which increases your carry capacity, but does not allow you to add extra strength cards.
---
To add to what Bravo said, this game is designed to make people grind.  There is no way around that fact, other then to trade or buy the legendary item/s and/or plans you want.  It took me literally 500 hours in game to find the deep pocketed leather chest plan.  But yet, once I switched to combat armor, I found the deep pocketed combat chest plan on my third play through of the "Census Violence" event.
---
You're not supposed to shoot it while cloaked is the takeaway
---
The work bench shouldn't be unreachable. I'm just saying that missile turrets should operate the same as OP weapons in PVP.    There's no way to hide from them  and you die in one shot.
---
Thank you for your response; I was sure I would be downvoted for bringing the real world into this lol. The biggest problem is you would have to build a sight ~2 feet high. That sight would either be very easily knocked out of alignment, considering how much we move while using big guns, or the sight contraption would have to have so much bracing that it would look like a spider web on top of the weapon. 
---
No large machine gun was ever designed to be accurate; they’ve all been designed to put as many rounds as possible into an area. Even Maxim guns, weighing over 100 pounds with their tripod, weren’t super accurate. I think the guns are about as accurate in game now as they should be.
---
Counterpoint, the people who show up and don't do anything to help anyway should be slammed anyway.  They could be out helping with crowd control, providing healing for people down or anything else useful instead of hiding in a bunker.
---
Thanks, documenting and reporting, solid exploit
---
Always the way for me too
---
Oh that sounds like my play style! I specifically made a VATS critical Gunslinger build. I found that going full Unyielding and using perks that synergize with low health/high rads is amazing. You always have +20 in every stat (except endurance) giving you high carry capacity, great VATS accuracy, the best bartering ability, can make the most durable gear, is near undetectable, and spits out Criticals so often that your pistols just melt enemies.
---
It's the Fonzie build of the wasteland.
---
Personally I put my cosmetic/underarmor at the bottom of my list since that rarely changes.  Then I used a top list symbol for different armor sets (* for Unyielding, = for my Mutant Slayer, etc).
---
Well, that was written a while ago and things could have changed. Also the way Todd spoke he seemed to be very aware of the details so I wouldn't discount him. My guess is that there will be the option to either roll a new weapon completely, or alter an existing one, with the 2nd option costing a lot more tokens.
---
I have noticed this as well. In my experience, HRF drop rate used to be roughly the same as hardened mass, with glowing mass somewhat less frequent. But in the last few weeks the HRF drops became the rarest of the three. This is based on about a dozen nuke zone runs, so it may be anecdotal, but it feels like something changed.  
---
Great example of why a more formal trading market would be helpful. I've dropped 100s of nuked flora at the whitesprings shops that I couldn't stabilize, hoping someone else could use it.
---
I thought fallout games were censored in China because of how it represents China in game/lore
---
A playful prank!
---
This is awesome and I wish it was on PC.
---
I never keep them either but that’s because I’ve noticed improvement in stash and pip boy speed when I toss them. I love the idea of keeping history but I can just read it online somewhere.
---
Gatling Gun doesn't need sights, they should remove it completely rather than fixing it IMO since the gun is already extremely powerful.
---
I see you must play Destiny to know that feeling.
---
Bethesda wouldn't have gone through of effort of making a unique character model to not use it over and over again.  It's not their way.
---
If we haven't seen the Sheepsquatch now, then we might in some later update.
---
Are you not amused by the jumpy wire connecty
---
thanks guys
---
This was the game duping not me lol but yah they can't stop duping to the point there own program is starting to dupe
---
I'd watch a livestream of someone roleplaying their character, complete with character commentary and all that.
---
Would love this, would save me the trip to find food, so many of my favorite recipes are locked by having to forage for it the old fashion way.
---
I'm on Xbox and experience the same thing, it's nearly killed me in PvP
---
Since he's a robot I have a troubleshooters sledge that takes decent chunks of health away from him if you need to engage up close, that's my tip.
---
You can sort by weight. I think on PS4 it’s L3 iirc. The “sort” at the bottom should change to “sort:wt” or something like that. It works in your own inventory and when trading, not 100% if this pops up when checking your stash though.
---
so nuke the event win. im down
---
It's actually useless, as any melee spec worth its salt uses Martial Artist card for 30% attack speed, which has a nice bonus of... reducing melee weapon weight by 90%.
---
+~65% DPS vs a pound or two of carry weight? Certainly not hard to beat.
---
All Rise is a good starter weapon, and that's it.
---
It did before last patch, not tested since.
---
i just stood there with my vampire's .50 cal and after activating one of the conduits. the lowest my HP got was 30% before refilling quickly (not using blocker, but in Excavator power armor)
---
Personally never saw it, but If I'm wrong hopefully some players will pile on and correct me!
---
Sounds like you were just having typical low level troubles, really. Theres a bit of a wall around the level 25 or 30 mark, but it gets easier after that. Around those levels you REALLY have think about damage boosting over quality of life perks, its a hard choice. There's no best way to do it. My opinion, you'll enjoy actually playing the game if you take those quality of life perks now and focus on dealing damage later. If that means you stay on the left hand side of the map a little longer, it's just more exploring.
---
Speaking of exploring. Remember that your CAMP is mobile. Those problems you had spending caps to return to wherever you were exploring could have been eliminated by plopping your camp down when you needed it. There's also work benches and stash boxes at all the train stations and most red rockets in the game. Hell, sometimes I stay on in a world when my camp can't be placed, just to see how well i know the map. A lot of troubles people have with this game is refusing to adapt their way of doing things. Fallout 76 is different from the other titles, if you play it like the old ones, you'll be miserable.

VATS is hard to get used to after playing fallout 4 but vats crit builds are totally viable. They just don't get built overnight. Some of the most useful perks come later or can only get maxed out over time. Melee is very easy, hardly requires any perks to be effective, you dont have to be a "melee build" to kill stuff with melee. Carry any old melee weapon and use it on the weak enemies, if you can kill it in a couple swings, save your ammo. 
---
Events are a great way to get supplies. Do whatever events pop up and you'll never have to worry about basic supplies like stimpacks and radaway and water. Not bad for caps, either. Government supply drops, too. Call those in as often as you can. Workshops are another great source of supplies. Learn the map, its resources. Food and water are everywhere. Consider cannibalism.
---
Still struggling with the 魔法使い burn?
---
Reading your reply, i'm not sure i've been clear enough previously.
---
My point was that if we change binding, it's not changed in build mode.
---
But, I don.t know how they could fix that.
---
Tried that before, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It's still very selective and I'm back to exiting and entering the build menu again when it doesn't.
---
I've got 5. I love it. Totally different playstyles.
---
I've got a "hardcore" character. As "realistic" as I can possibly make him. I limit carry weights, numbers of items, size of camp.. try to keep it as real as I can, in terms of a wasteland wanderer, carrying everything with him.
---
I've got my drug and booze fueled melee cannibal clown. I kind of imagine him as a  Twisty the Clown in a Road Warrior world. Strength, Endurance, and enough in others to get some decent perks to support smashing and hacking.
---
I've got a character I based on the future Dystopian "Grendels" from the later series of Matt Wagner's "Grendel". Probably dropping him at some point, too similar to my first character.
---
A Mad Scientist that is 100% focused on whatever perks seem most "science-y", regardless of Meta. Chems and energy weapons and syringers… while also focusing on group dynamics (charisma). Basically, he's a group support character. Cha/Int mostly.
---
and a Junkie. That's it. That's her whole schtick. Uses chems the second she finds them. Will trade gear for chems, no matter the gear... suffers through withdrawals... (No addictol allowed). Will sell everything for caps to buy more chems if she can't trade for them. All perks are chem related. She carries a knife, and a .44. Charisma and luck, for the most part.
---
I feel your pain, man!
---
I think so too. Maybe today’s patch will clear it up. Would be cool if The Burrow dungeon we are getting is related too
---
If you killed anything even if it was just one bot ..... you contributed and i am saying this as a player that has the weapon to endanger the sheepsquatch imposter. I can focus on getting it for the group and you give me the time to shoot at it while not worry about the rest.
---
good luck, most people in the US cant even buy atoms, the store is a shitshow, and it will continue to be a shitshow as long as they keep using digital river as a payment processor, should have picked stripe, and the paypal button does nothing
---
I thought the patch undid this if you have pacifist mode enabled?
---
Smarty confirmed
---
In fairness, none of what you're describing has been seen in-game yet, and we would certainly expect to have seen it if it were true. Though I will happily grant that it could be that it's intended to be rolled out as part of that Pioneer Scouts questline a little later in Wild Appalachia, and if so, that would be very cool. But what I'm saying is that it's also possible that just as the character model might have been put there for data-miners to find and post online as a deliberate false lead, so too might the items you cite here. It's not like Bethesda is unaware that data-miners will inevitably find every secret and every surprise that they include in the game's files long before Bethesda intends for us to see any of it. If I were them, I think I'd start putting false and misleading stuff in the game's files just to trick data-miners in order to have a little goof with them, and this would be a very clever way to go about it.
---
Digital Combustion. It is a serious problem in the post apocalypse. I have seen so many fellow Vault Dwellers disappear due to Digital Combustion. It is never a pretty sight.
---
&gt; 魔法使い burn?
---
Is that what it was supposed to be? Because no, nobody talks like that outside anime.
---
Ehjh, I lost a ton of stuff this way, but it is partof the event. Its junk. I will get it back. I never carry the hard stuff to get like flux or anything anyway.
---
Great advice! Those scorchbeast meats are fine cuts. I purposefully hunt them down whenever I see one just for their meat (and possible Prime Plans). It didn't occur to me that I could have more scorched meat.
---
The rule is you get new stuff and two severe bugs, and the severe bugs disappear within a week.
---
I'll give you 1000 caps for it
---
This has been a dream of many strong vault dweller but unlikely to be done anytime soon. Crossing my fingers and hitting that thumps up to hopefully rise this high enough.
---
Agree on the stimpack usage. Tried it the first run ,but now i just die. Will still help others calling for help if possible though.
---
It can be tough in this new event as there are many targets and its super easy to lose health so the ol zig zag method is generally employed. I use a lot of explosive weapons and get a bit salty when folks run in front of me and cause me to damage myself, but its just part of those types of events. If you are really worried about it try finding high ground and a more clear line of sight.
---
Yea, i never said it was you, many duping methods were discovered by accident
---
Documented and reported!
---
The game has potential. But it burned a lot of the followerbase. Obviously, saying anything negative about the game on this subreddit will result in downvotes because people here barely question bethesda. That's part of the reason why they spit into the face of players even more now with their pay2win repairkits. They already know they scorched the earth and got rid of almost every player who is not completely fanatical. And those players won't be bothered by pay2win mechanics. Most of them probably don't even remember that bethesda will introduce them soon. That's also part of the reason why bethesda will never change. There is never a big outrage from the community when they screw up. Compare that to anthem, where players strike for a full week because the game is not what was promised.
---
But yeah, the bethesda fanboyism is too powerful. Funny that I once considered myself as a bethesda fanboy too. Got a tattoo of the brotherhood of steel on my left upper arm ... welp.
---
Yeah my thoughts exactly haha. So they should just remove the sights completely IMO. My Furious Gatling gun is already ez-mode for me with very little practice!
---
Don't forget though that this Gatling Gun has been modified to fire modern 5mm rounds. We can imagine that the whole rechamber and barrel rebore could have made the gun more accurate than its original design? I tend to just make stuff up in my head to explain these kinds of things haha. But yes for balance purposes, the Gatling is already VERY accurate, considering the fire rate and damage (500 fire rate and 99 damage for mine, plus Furious perk).... And 5mm rounds are so cheap!
---
I'm just sick of wasting resources on three star legendaries, and getting some one star wooden armor that gives me 15% less damage from Mirelurks... Who would even use that?
---
I literally have no good legendary weapons, and I'm level 60. I have a Vampiric sledge that I attached the rocketed mod to and it's got the fancy saw blades on it. I also have an Instigating Handmade, but it's level 35. I'm very discouraged...
---
You will not be failed if you build yourself around bloodied handmade vats crit unyielding sneaker.
---
Yeah, the buffs that Scorched Beast meat provide are really quite, something. Since the Vendor update, I keep checking in at Whitesprings for new recipes. Some of the food buffs are nuts.
---
No judgement as I use them, are you using mods / lock picking mod?  
---
Curious for replication and troubleshooting.
---
I sell my junk to venders all the time, junk is too easy to find in this game. 
---
But I’m not playing to make thousands of caps off forums. I sold an AA fatman lvl 50 to a vender for under 100 caps cuz it didn’t fit my build. This game is not that serious, and I’ve done just fine without ever trading on online forums. 
---
And the most recent junk And aid I sell to venders is off the dead bodies of higher level people I have been murking in PvP mode. Not farming off dead players who are presumably all working together to finish an endgame quest.
---
Did this last night with only 3 randoms, we all communicated, 2 went for pylons and gutsies while me and another guy kited the damn thing. It's not that hard of an event but yes, it can be very frustrating if you dont communicate and just run around shooting like a moron
---
are insect spawn in general just screwed up? I've been trying to run Tea Time all week but at best I've had a single wave with maybe 6-7 mobs
---
Well what am I suppose to do if it is right in front of me killing me ?
---
I do no spray my fire all over and believe me I can still see its health drop.
---
That's the screenshot I'm using. [I made a little more progress](https://imgur.com/VeLPp0t) still not sure what it is and I don't think I'm going to be able to unscramble the parts that are in really tiny pieces.
---
The annoying part is switching those card.
---
I always take a rifle perk out to get butcher bounty,and most of the time forget to put in back on.
---
Dodgy is also good to have, as well as Lone Wanderer if you're going solo.
---
Oof wow
---
I got a T-60 jetpack and T-51b jetpack plans in back to back SBQ fights last night. Weird thing was 2 other ppl in my team got the T-60 off her the same time i did!
---
I guess so because she is the only one pregnant lol
---
If you had to build a special machine (hydroponics unit) that could only grow one plant.  That would be a natural way of limiting the number of plants.
---
Oddly enough the reason we haven't seen it yet is because both the event and the sheepsquatch are "ticked off", as in won't pop up till Bethesda ticks them on during a update or maintenance. Hopefully this maintenance going on right now will add them. If not, then it's something we might see next week with the dungeon update. If Bethesda wants to goof then let them, but I don't see reason behind making a sheepsquatch meat, a sheepsquatch horn, multiple sheepsquatch weapons, mods for said weapons, a whole new event for said sheepsquatch. It would be a waste of resources you could say.
---
That's fair. I'm currently geared for heavy gunning, so my perception cards are a bit more flexible.
---
Uhhh how so? Please explain
---
If you click on the Looking for Group section of Fallout 76 on your Xbox, people usually post when they’re doing the event. 
---
You have to be fast so you don’t get stuck at a world full login, but I’ve been able to do quite a few events that way.
---
Awesome work there is definitely something there
---
With regards to Wine and Rum, I'd be switching them out. So, when one has worn off I use the other or I could just use one and when its stock has run out I switch to the other. I could see about combining this with chems but I'd have to recheck which ones will boost Agility, AP, or AP regen.
---
That would explain why it focused me three spawns in a row the other day and charged right passed 5 other players to get me.
---
Thats... surprising given that I use a standard Lever Action and there where definitely TSE weapons on the field at the time. I must have been the only one that tagged it when it’s shield was down.
---
Berserker is best for nuke zones if you're running around in a hazmat suit. Radiation resistance doesn't count towards Berserker's effect.
---
I'm glad that I learned the new story-line needs a group to finish.  I can put that off for a while now.
---
Add another star/2 to green thumb? (the double plant yield perk in perception), rank 2 double yield and can plant tier 2 trees, rank 3 double yield and can plant tier 3 trees.
---
I guess its kinda like the Smurfs.....
---
Wow!  Thank you for your help.  This will help a tremendous amount.  Much appreciated!
---
That’s just the Tea Time event. It has pretty much always had inconsistent waves of enemies.
---
The jet pack drains your fusion cores pretty quickly, but it's a blast.  Being able to access rooftops and other inaccessible spots really adds another element to the game.
---
Guess we have different ideas about jokes but I’m sure you’re a real funny guy 😁
---
When I'm running for my life I generally don't look back at the plumbing.
---
I'm my opinion, it's just a hard event. Since I'm still low level with crappy guns...I just tried to make sure the pylons were powered and get a few shots in on the sheepsquatch but that's all I felt I could do for the event. No way in hell can it be completed by one or two folks.
---
The point is, people often act rashly based on the opinions of others. Thats why hate speech is dangerous.
---
Please can we stop posting spoilers so soon after the new content? The SPOILER tag is great when you've already read the post title...
---
You're right, I have no idea what it is, but if it gives you an advantage in any way over normal game mechanics it absolutely gives people abusing it an edge over those who are not utilizing it.
---
perfectly preserved my ass. 1 RADS!
---
This is a nail in the coffin of another report, multiple people are having quests fail to complete or advance, I'm lumping this in.  
---
Thanks for the details!
---
Controller is just as bad here.
---
'B' usually represents 'Back' ot 'Cancel' out but in this implementation it represents the Affimrative.
---
***TERRIBLE UI***
---
Is that actually a glitch or is it by design?
---
 [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17cuFD5QTLcpHsu2ToslPVSM4DisjxRnofCj7AnvNg5M/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17cuFD5QTLcpHsu2ToslPVSM4DisjxRnofCj7AnvNg5M/edit?usp=sharing) Here is the link of all the stuff datamined for the latest patch (Had to dig through recent messages to find it again). As said, the Free Range event is apparently ticked off, so is the sheepsquatch, so neither will pop up till Bethesda ticks them both on.
---
Maybe they actually buffed drops? Who knows haha
---
I believe he’s asking for a new sort element “value by weight” like his spreadsheet shows.
---
Usually I get one but the last two I didn't get any warning. Played yesterday and today, didn't get any notification. Did get the "new info tab" but didn't see any update stuff. At least the game gave me a countdown warning. Almost missed an airdrop.
---
Haha, still looks amazing after all the years though 😂
---
I would like to get a Happy meal but I don't think I should pay for the fries cuz I've already ordered fries...
---
I'm sorry I should have been more vague. This is an important PSA though. Sorry again dude, have fun on the questline
---
Slap Damage gets removed, shit posts like this pop up.   
---
I normally store my junk for that very reason prior fighting the sheepsquach.
---
It’s faster than you think. Beats getting run through by a ton of gutsy while you’re already taking a good amount of DoT from the pylons.
---
You can do it even without this though. The only time I failed is when I showed up late and was not on a team. Just trying w a dozen randoms. Only one other guy was even trying to tag the pylons.
---
Every other time I’ve done it with at least a team of 2 and team medic and we have been fine. There’s always been at least one other person willing to get the third pylon. We just stay close so we have to use half as many stims.
---
Thank you very much ill be sure to be doing that just when the maintenece stops 😊
---
THIS THIS THIS. Report all posts as there is a rule about it.
---
It can work sometimes but the problem is that it's selective and doesn't always work. I've tried quite a few different tricks and it seems like they're the solution but then they still eventually fail. We need an actual hard coded fix to this unfortunately.
---
Got t45 jetpack plan from sbq this morning. I thought I just got lucky but it seems they might've messed up with rare plans drop rates. Still I'm glad that now I won't need to look for jetpack mods for my future alts -))
---
Bethesda still knows who's selling what the most. If you're selling a specific item everyday for a good amount of caps they'll know. If its broken as the Top Hat was, they'll fix it.
---
I have the strategy guide and it says aliens ARE in the game but nobody's found one besides Flatwoods Monster to my knowledge.
---
Tbh with all the patches and nerfs and changes since launch, the guidebook is a glorified map book. Everything else in it is useless now.
---
&gt; try finding high ground
---
A.k.a the shack roof
---
Snaptails!
---
Even if they require water, I can move my house (or we could just have plots that are saturated with water)
---
I've been finding random flux flowers at times while exploring the map, in areas that I doubt people nuked, so all I can say is maybe?
---
It won't take damage if all 3 pylons aren't active. Activate the pylons every time they go offline. Keep stimming yourself to negate the damage you'll take from being a conduit. Keep moving to stay away from the Sheepsquatch. Obviously try not to get caught in the eyebeam.
---
You can activate all the pylons yourself, but if you're the conduit for more than one, you start to take some serious damage. So it helps to have other players activating them too.  And watch out for the Gutsys, they pack a wallop.
---
I've completed it twice, without power armor both times. Energy resist helps a lot. Other than those tips...git gud? Lol
---
I plan on doing the quest once maintenance ends or maybe later tonight depending on time constraints if you want to leave your GT I'll invite when I'm getting ready to start it
---
Same exact thought, heck plenty of better spots they could put or event take some of lobby desks and put a sign or two of corresponding faction next lobby desks. But yea a lot of better options but it feels like they kinda of rushed it.
---
Haha nice! I’m gonna be trying to do that today.
---
I would like to have the following:
---
* Different plants can grow on different types of terrain: some need to be near lava, others inside the water.
---
* Different plants call for different hordes of plagues. You asked for it.
---
* Plants require specific *ingredients* in the workshop otherwise they rot (water, fertilizer, acid, nuclear waste, ...). It depends on the plants.
---
Coordination is the issue but.
---
Stims are a must!
---
1. Activate pylons (it'll pop up on screen) the conduit should have stims to spare/spam.
---
2. Hit the Imposter only when it is vulnerable. (Otherwise it's an ammo dump)
---
3. Lower levels should concentrate on mobs,
---
Only because they keep spawning and the Imposter will decimate said lower levels with ease.
---
4) Rinse and Repeat.
---
If you make a welter weight at 3 strength i might compete. I'll get all three ranks of unarmed!
---
Yeah no thanks.  Don’t need anymore propaganda from them.  Why post on Twitter but not the game?
---
Bloodied deathclaw gauntlet: LoveLiesBleeding
---
AA death tambo: JingleJangle
---
AA combat knife: JustaLittlePrick
---
I haven't witnessed flux from a radstorm but have found random flux areas with no nuke on my map.
---
Nope. If a player (or anything) passes between you and the target, VATS closes. Annoying when you have only a few targets, nearly impossible to re-aquire the right target when there are many enemies. And in some builds, accuracy and damage output depends on subsequent VATS shots.
---
That's because it probably wasn't in the files till tuesday.
---
But i also don't think that's the way.
---
I don't know how he says it's a weekly,but if it's just brew 10 drink,i'll do it in 5 minutes.
---
Under many circumstances in the US it is also a  crime to withhold information.
---
Factions bots are too pedestrian to work at The Whitesprings.
---
I had that tech data bug but it went away after 2 days. Not sure what triggered it or what fixed it.
---
Gotcha, yeah that would be more convenient for sure!
---
Thanks, documenting and reporting!
---
\*looks at the red highlighted white text next to title, looks at person complaining\*
---
FFS indeed.
---
And I think it’s a dick head move to put your camp there so the spawns get jacked up . I hope everyone and their mama burns it down
---
All speculation based on the small drops of info BGS has shown.
---
I have not played since monday , i cant stand the staggering
---
Thanks for the confirmation, documenting and reporting.
---
I just wait/server hop and buy into the event for minimal cap cost.
---
On my side, I try to get a position away from the melee scrum, and above it as much as possible to minimize that interaction. All I ask is you also bear that in mind.  
---
I didn't think about it in my melee first character until a sniper explained it to me in a group. Knowing is half the battle. I feel his pain now.
---
Since im super overcumbered at the moment, i walk from my CAMP in Flatwoods to the Nuka Plant (loot everything), then walk to Candem Park (loot everything), if im still missing couple hundred caps i walk towards Welch (loot everything) then switch servers and return the same route.
---
Name the time and psn name and I'm there... to spectate/ do sniper guard duty.
---
Thanks for piling on, documenting and reporting.
---
 зщщк пгн
---
Sneak Crit build murders the thing. The game is that of armor, and this boss has a ton of it. Crits ignore all armor.
---
I see all the try-hards have officially taken over this game. I don’t want a level 341 screaming at me on mic smashing chips into his mouth, I want to experience the wanton death and destruction that ensures without having my ears imploding over how they want people to hit the pylons and how they want to control the 10+ people playing the event because they think they are superior. Let us live our lives! -end of rant-
---
Yea nothing is more rewarding then getting the damn drill. Just feels like a massive middle finger.
---
Same protocol as for the Queen, but  I think this event is so much easier for lower levels to actually participate and be effective in.
---
Confirmed on Xbox
---
Assaultrons are kinda pathetic with their legs cut out from under them. Getting them to that stage is another story entirely.
---
DON'T GO TO THE EVENT CARRYING JUNK! It takes about 30 seconds to fast travel to your C.A.M.P. and dump it in your stash, then fast-travel to the fight. And yes, it is extremely rude of people to take your junk, but you were also being stupid going somewhere you will almost certainly die with a bunch of loot you don't want to lose. Play in the road, get hit by a car. Don't feed the trolls.
---
Thanks, documenting and reporting, enough people are seeing this cross platform and multiple quests.
---
People have a hard time understanding RNG being random
---
Yes, I’m on Xbox as well. I should have stated that.
---
Low/mid-levels should be on Pacifist and could dropping as many mines as they can. Works great on eyebots.
---
Unfortunately I still need to get the achievemente to res people, so *Free stimpacks and vodkaaaas*
---
That dude swatted me right out of the air multiple times lol.
---
They must have forgotten to Nerf Carrots...
---
It's a while since I did that mission but iirc there's a message on CRYPTOS that runs over two pages, although it looks like it's only one. The link to advance the mission is on the second page. Maybe someone will recall it better than I do.
---
No sorting options, it does seem a little erratic.
---
You can take out a Gutsy's thrusters long before you can get rid of the arms.
---
What seems to have worked for me last few runs because people dont seem to be able to read the event. I get all 3 pylons sit on top of the house and mini nuke the adds and sheepsquatch. With the cola nut perk at Max I end up using maybe 5 -6 quantum's for the whole thing.
---
Why watoga and that combo tho? So slow!
---
Get a formal dress and be well fed and you can do this anywhere....precisely west tech,where you can level up in 3 server hops.
---
It really shouldn’t take min/maxed builds. A few solid players working together shouldn’t have much trouble. Again, IMO, team medic goes a *long* way w this specific event.
---
Thanks, documented and reported
---
The Bethesda Support Only tweets when the game is going to have maintenance or when it comes backup. No "propaganda"
---
Same, too bad the storms are more rare than Grahm
---
Do you know if the perk that reduces sprinting drain also works on the jetpack?
---
Forgot to mention we will be needing security😂 last time we had a deathclaw that wanted to watch and scared the shit out of some level 15s lmao. Fights tonight around 7:30 PST
---
The best possible fight would be two Strength 1 players slapping at each other for god knows how long.
---
If by quick, you mean the next patch... I don't know, but my gut says "maybe".
---
Do we really need 5 posts about this? Just report the spoiler posts and move on.
---
Haven’t thought of weight classes! Very cool I’ll put implement that in.
---
Hopefully it’s instanced. That would be a real bummer if it’s not.
---
I really hope so. Or maybe a Hotfix. The friends list need a Hotfix too.
---
Anybody successfully kill the imposter and then rewards don't trigger? It's happened to me twice now. And another time the imposters body was invisible for me so couldn't loot it. This happened to anyone else?
---
I haven't tested it, but I don't think it does.
---
This is so much worse when you have marsupial and are in a team.
---
Fights tonight will be around 7:30 PST
---
I’m aiming for 7:30 PST. see you there!
---
Ps4 online
---
I got mine from there.
---
Even Flash doesn't eat or drink nearly as much as these characters do. Anyway, agree to disageee :)
---
Socialism is pretty shit bro, plenty of data available to support this. Also Denmark is a constitutional Monarchy, not a socialism country.
---
Yeah you’re probably right. I’m just hoping it takes a little longer since not everyone is requesting the plan on the market and I’ve not seen it talked about at all really
---
Jerk move👎🏻
---
Then have the crowd toss in some chems/melee weapons, *Shadow of Rome* style. "USE THIS!" A fucking rose?! Seriously!!!?
---
So much this. It is amazing how many people are doing this
---
Surely if you hit repair all on the CAMP it repairs it all for basically nothing?...Plus I'm not judging how other people live but I certainly wouldn't let my childten play an 18 rated game..
---
It doesn't appear the dungeon is instanced. Looks pretty interesting!
---
Well, there is a place in the game with about half a dozen kitties, just behind/around a billboard. Not sure if you can build there, but if she could, she would have many, many kitties in her camp. Now if I could just remember the damn location. I think it was up east into the mountains from that big train-crash with all the robots (between Whitesprings and Top of the World).
---
It seems heavily implied that it is instanced, which is awesome to me.
---
Be sure to also check on the ground near the corpse. Sometimes the legendary will spawn near the corpse instead of on the corpse. Seems to also be server dependent.
---
You should probably wait for when it actually drops.  No one actually knows. Anything anyone tells you about how it works is speculation.
---
Agree as the bot waves do not feel like it has an end. Looking at the battle while charging back at the imposter after I died makes quite a site with people fighting all over.
---
Yeah if only the flame would stack, that weapon would be nice ish. Wouldn't have to be 3 \* ... just a fun unique
---
It took me hours to do it, it's one of the longest quests ingame
---
Yep that's the diving suit from Far Harbour Fallout 4
---
Doesn't look like PA from a closer look.
---
It looks like a modified robot armor skin with a nautical style helmet
---
I noticed that too..looks dope
---
People should absolutely stop, but also let's not forget what people have been saying for quite some time now... 
---
*Moderators* (like u/shaka1277 and the 8 others) should be *moderating*
---
It actually makes complete logical sense unless you have some sort of perk unlock for gardening, maybe requires green thumb or add a second level to green thumb and each level unlocks new plant types and hopefully planter boxes. Maybe it will be added via quest like the mounted heads.
---
Average person couldn't grow oranges in Alaska, makes more sense if it unlocks for a reason but might also require new unlockable junk like "mire soil" besides the fertilizer.
---
I don’t do it for the spawns, I do it because for my quests lately it’s less caps to travel there &amp; the robots will help protect the area? I don’t understand why you’re so hostile about something that doesn’t even effect you.
---
Get your aquaboy perks ready!
---
The Top Hat got out of hand when the reddit got a hold of it to be honest. What ever info you got keep it yourself and enjoy it while it last.
---
Sorry man that's 3am for me😥
---
I would imagine it is, but they mentioned during an interview that the vault raids were their 1st attempt using instance tech, so not sure at this point
---
Great, the camera has been delayed.
---
Maybe if the mirv went more then 40 yards and drop straight to the dirt then I'd agree with ya.
---
Are you on PS4.?
---
I'll gladly clear your bounty if you want lol.
---
Message me if you need to.

Had 6 high level players last night and the thing destroyed us.  I don’t think many of us were in a group... I play solo most of the time.. This event Must be done as a group or you will be wasting your time.  It’s the first time in the game I’ve died continuously.  Keep pylons active and ranged attacks. Attempt to access the roof of the building to prevent its melee attacks
---
Ahh yes you're probably right!
---
If we go earlier I’ll let you know :)
---
The other picture also has what looks like a guy wearing a Arktos Pharma labcoat.
---
“We hope you have been enjoying the investigation so far”
---
Sounds like there will be more to come on the Sheepsquatch.
---
I'm glad they're doing stuff like this. It really goes to shows that they care about the community.
---
Seriously.
---
Nice, good catch
---
Where is that picture from?
---
Hey just a quick heads up, today the quest, as well as the note, has disappeared from my inventory. I went to the campsite and nothing's there. ( This today's morning, before the maintenance )
---
You need to press another button after inspecting, says it towards the bottom right. It'll come up with another menu to say if you have all the stuff or not to repair.
---
I don’t necessarily think every 3* needs to drop 3* items, but the big bosses like this and SBQ absolutely should. Those are big fights that cost a lot of time and resources—especially SBQ.
---
With that said, satisfying loot doesn’t have to be just legendary items, though they need to be part of it. Plans, unique cosmetics, rare scrap and yes, the upcoming 150% repair kits...those are all solid things to include that make big fights more worthwhile.
---
&gt; Also the way Todd spoke he seemed to be very aware of the details so I wouldn't discount him
---
He also sounded very aware at e3, half of it turned out to be a bit... wrong. I'm sure he's very aware of the direction they want to take the game and probably is involved in forming the direction they move, but the minutiae that ultimately makes up the game we play is lost on him.

New inside the vault:  [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1QMBfEfLfsdy3ho9eYMoQ0/inside-the-vault-the-burrows-and-camera-preview?utm\_source=Community&amp;utm\_medium=Social&amp;sf101158891=1](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1QMBfEfLfsdy3ho9eYMoQ0/inside-the-vault-the-burrows-and-camera-preview?utm_source=Community&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;sf101158891=1)
---
Seems like the diving armor from fallout 4 in the far harbor dlc, pretty sure its that one
---
Is gambling on the outcome allowed?
---
I’ve tried and I haven’t seen any button after that, the bars where my weapons and their stats and mods are just gone, but the boxes are still there
---
Wow thanks!
---
So my understanding is that they can only hot-fix server-side bugs, because apparently Sony and Microsoft charge developers millions of dollars every time they patch console games. So thats why they try and stuff as many bug fixes as they can into each patch.
---
Too bad they add more content at the same time... which introduce more bugs. *To sheds, you say?*
---
Really? So the event is in the game then? Or is it just the same bug?
---
At least npc attacks on camp items
---
Personally I would not suggest encouraging Bethesda to be buying atoms.
---
Thankfully the amount of premium currency earnt in game is the most generous of any online game I've ever seen!
---
&gt; Bets are allowed and highly encouraged!!!
---
Aaaand now I'm interested.
---
Such a lovely dream!
---
There are notes and holotapes  in sugar grove that would seem to go with this potentially. there is someone at sugar grove who wasn't on the up and up and was whistle blowing or trying to before he got caught(capture on holotape). I think we'll be going there before the end of wild appalachia and the cryptid stuff.  
---
I think within the next year the whole map becomes much more active. It'll be interesting to see what happens
---
**Never, EVERY** apologize when giving fantastic notes like this!  
---
1) In PA or out?  
---
2) Seeing the same thing, and running a dual xeon build which allows me to run (3) instances of the game at 50+ FPS, yet with even one client open I'll see the crazy drop in performance or straight up "lock".      
---
Thanks for the recognition!  
---
I really want to see the game succeed, I don't love the hours it takes to document, troubleshoot and report this (5 hours yesterday for example for this Post alone) stuff, but it seems worth the investment as it's helping us the players and one can only hope, Bethesda/Zenimax.    
---
Several others have suggested the same, and agree in large part because it often includes work arounds and if nothing else lets people they are not alone... 
---
However the Mods (I think I spoke with [u/Shaka1277](https://www.reddit.com/user/Shaka1277) ) said due to other people "checking out" part way through they have a policy of never, ever Pinning Non-Moderator/Game Rep posts.  
---
Oddly the Community Managers almost never comment on Posts like this, I have one that had them tagged about a dozen different times, and they didn't respond until it broke 3k Upvotes.
---
&gt; Afte reading alot of comments I still don't understan how this impacts gameplay. Yes it's something you can buy, does it give you an overall advantage over everyone else?
---
You can remove all your repair perks and put them into damage perks, that is a direct game changing advantage over someone who doesn't buy the repair kits.
---
They are coming out with new dungeon-like areas which may not be quick to leave and repair, so carrying some repair kits on you would be a good idea, making them on the atom store pretty convenient and giving another potential advantage to those who choose to buy them off the Atom store. Games with MTX will ALWAYS push them and often they will tweak the game itself to push them - making repairs cost more, making items degrade faster, making you have to stop what you're doing to repair...etc so buying them easily off the store is the desirable choice. It's a business, it's what businesses do. 
---
A lot of the issue is the fact they lied, they said specifically the store would be "Cosmetic only" and they are now introducing something that isn't cosmetic, and as seen from their complete silence over the issue - they don't care that they lied. This won't be the first non-cosmetic utility item added, mark my words.
---
The other picture they posted with Inside The Vault has a guy wearing a lab coat, from Arktos Pharma I think, going by the bear icon.
---
jack the ripper from fallout 3, golden gloves from new vegas, paladin's toaster NV, bumper swords in general, bb guns, that gun NV, holy frag grenade NV, drone cannon ex-b FO3, more alien weapons like ones from FO3, and the Wazer Wifle
---
More or less agree, and same boat.... It's better in some ways, but not others.
---
It was yesterday. Not sure if it's intended. It was an unusual name.
---
You can get a total of 4 from the main questline and the 4 sidequests (owlet, yao guai, radstag and wolf). Other than that I am curious as well how to get these.
---
Maybe they are drops from the event? Still waiting to find out myself...
---
A current theory is that that the real Sheepsquatch will be the end boss of the Warren-dungeon that is released next Tuesday.
---
Yes but grinding to level a weapon could be balanced so that it’s equal to grinding mobs for random drops. I’d like to see an upgrading system as it would create a sense of attachment with the ones you upgraded yourself
---
More dots
---
Good. Please don't encourage microtransactions by buying them, especially now that Bethesda is going back on their word about cosmetic only.
---
The button is usually R after you inspect. Bottom of screen its called "Workshop Repair" or something along those lines.
---
3 hr. cooldown
---
Is it broken upon logging in, or is there something else that triggered it.
---
Pardon my ignorance, what is DPS?
---
I have the opposite problem, sometimes the game refuses to let me jump when carrying a camp object or wire at all!
---
Can't wait, I wish this game sucked...I might have some kind of outside of work life again! I really hope the camera addition means an expansion to the allowed saved photo count, 50 just is not cutting it anymore!
---
Hey Mods, Is there a "TROLL" flair that you can add to certain posters?
---
thanks, will try to replicate.
---
Indeed, they are easy when downed unless you stand there to let them lazor you. Something tells me that 3* lvl 70 Assaultron o'doom will be rather difficult to cripple.
---
There are so many simple ways for unlimited database load that would have zero negative effect on server stability. 
---
One of the most effiecient one is probably also the easiest one: Different stashes for different items. 
---
Just imagine how much easier would it be for the server when player is getting weapon from stash if that stash would not have to show every single junk item in there too...
---
Ahh well that would be why I don't recognise it. Only played about 12 hours of FO4. Wasn't feeling it. Good news tho, because of 76 I've made time to start FO4 again :)
---
Thanks for contributing to the problem.
---
Ah poop, working a night job on the east coast, Ill still be asleep. If yall do one on the weekend I'll come be your hired goon though.
---
after you repair or inspect a weapon you gotta back out completely for the box to display anything. its a small issue they added when they changed how it worked. prepping for those repair kits..
---
Japanese consoles have always been more popular in Japan, not Sony specifically; Microsoft have never done great there
---
Enemies were so low level
---
If memory serves me right,  you select "T" to inspect them "R" to repair...
---
I hate it when good people have all PS4 messages blocked.  So frustrating you can’t even thank them!
---
Damage Per Second, how much damage you are dealing per second
---
Funny thing with the roaches. With welded rebar on my power torso; I just ignore them...they sort themselves out.
---
With nothing but the UnderArmor equipped do the gloves show up?
---
Yeah maybe they shouldnt act so rash, maybe they should be civil mannered and not like children having a fit
---
They're more annoying to me than anything else. I play a main tank in WoW so seeing my hp be very spiky is just another day. For other players I can understand the need to panic.
---
Not a problem when logging in normally, put if you enter Power Armour the reload effect doesn’t work and won’t until you remove and add the perk again, exactly the same if you leave PA.
---
Aw :/ if I wasn’t working as well it would be earlier for sure. See you this weekend!!
---
u/ladydevann
---
u/valseek
---
Look at that submariner armor from far harbour trying to hide in plain sight there.
---
ok, that is the older UnderArmor bug creeping in, can't remember if it was reported fixed, so will check the patch notes.
---
Y'all can crash at my place, I'll buy pizza and beer!
---
Why do the vendors have over 1400 caps one moment and when you come back to sell some more stuff maybe an hour later they have 0 cap? What, is the 1400 caps for everyone and once someone sells their stuff for 1400 caps there's no more caps until the next 20 hours, so it's first come first serve?  Also, why does everything weigh more after this update?
---
Camera delayed lol Jesus Christ.
---
The faction cosmetics are like drag and drop easy to get in the game. I am so confused why it hasn't happened yet
---
 I tried to do this with a random group. it was an uncoordinated mess and blew up.
---
On the flip side, I killed a no star legendary and it dropped a 3 star for me so..... Also been seeing an uptick in legendary enemies but that maybe just from going to better locations.
---
Yeah I would like to think that the 'sheepsquatch' is going to be the big bad at the end of this season's content.
---
Maybe in the burrows we fight another sheepsquatch imposter of some sort. Or maybe just some flavor text from the inevitable holotapes we find. Then in the next underground Arktos Lab dungeon quest there's even more hints at a sheepsquatch cryptid.
---
And then later in the Ever Upwards Pioneer Scouts mission it ends with telling scary stories about the sheepsquatch around a campfire and lo and behold the sheepsquatch himself shows up to terrorize the little robo-campers (gotta be tiny protectron pioneer scouts, right?) and we the human camp counselors have to take him out and keep the little ones safe.
---
Haha thanks  to Biv I have plenty of booze for Quack surgeon, grabbed all those charisma perks to help revives, the luck one for a 50%chance to keep stimpak on revive and Revenant for that extra dps upon revive. Have never used these perks, started as a party build but all friends quit, it's nice to have a reason to use em.
---
Well, if Calvin were trying to lur ein the real one, his uploading "Sheepsquatch mating protocols" makes way more sense. :)
---
Changing weapons then changing back fixes this for me. Annoying I know but until they fix it it's the only fix I've come across.
---
Ha! It's like playing the old James Bond death matches with my kids, when they were little and just learning how to play video games. I used to tell them constantly, "PICK A SIDE! RIGHT OR LEFT! JUST STOP RUNNING IN FRONT OF ME!!^#%@$!"
---
Are you serious ? It took me longer to do roses raiders quest , this took less then an hour for me
---
Country Roads already broke that ceiling. We are doing 70s songs now too for reasons.
---
Once you have Spotify open on your Xbox, you can pick “continue playing” it on your phone, and change it from there. No need to cast anything. You can even control the volume from the phone’s volume slider
---
Maybe we’ll see it when the legendary vendor comes out
---
Well when you put it that way it makes sense, I do agree that the whole cosmetics only lie is a bit infuriating but I don't really see alot of problem in them, if it's about PVP, Bethesda could block them from being used there but we will jsut have to wait adn see how everything turns out.
---
You see me running naked before 
---
You see me running on hazmat suit now lol
---
&gt; Does anyone know how to improve this situation?
---
Bethesda could have made a game with no microtransactions so you wouldn't need to spend additional money on the game you already spent money on.
---
When Bethesda does finally add the option to purchase Atoms in Japan, they need to bring back all those limited time offers and items that have been removed from the shop for the Japan region as compensation.
---
Right ,at the end of the trailer you see part of the face of a monster and that we are still to meet.
---
I’ll have to look into getting in one.  In the meantime I might go try to clear out the other bots with my Bloodied buzzblade,  rips right through gutsys and protectrons
---
Yes this happened to me. Body was invisible looked like it was underground so couldn't loot after.
---
It really sucks that we have to celebrate this...

---
I couldn't find the barn one online as I'm not at home, but it's the exact same lay out as this one, just made with warehouse stuff instead of barn. You can make use of the big garage door since the big double barn doors don't exist in game.
---
And a good addition to that would be discovering hydroponic recipes so you can grow stuff anywhere!  I've been playing too much Kenshi...
---
Absolutely. Ever since the distilling update they've been a pain in the ass. Half the time now the weekly ones are actually easier.
---
Can you apply mods once again?
---
I think you're getting it refilled immediately instead
---
Going into my professor to let him know I won't be doing that presentation on my PhD research tomorrow because Leddit needs me, brb. 
---
Not only am I modding in between HPLC runs and powerpoint sections, but I'm actually on the way towards stepping down and absolutely the last person on the team who needs to be singled out over this. I was supposed to step down in March but stayed on for a little longer to help out where I could, helping with interviews, subreddit backups, Discord handover, automod tweaking and other things. Of course you wouldn't know that (apart from the Discord, if you're there), nor would anybody other than the mods, but I still don't see a need to single me out.
---
I’ve heard that you trade in legendary items for tokens. These tokens are then used to reroll legendary effects on your weapons, but it may be complaining different when it comes out. You may be able to add legendary effects to non legendary items, or might be able to add more stars to a legendary.
---
Hopefully that helped you see the other side of the argument. It's a big deal for me personally, but I can understand how others may not see it that way. The fact they haven't said a single thing about it, and the community managers haven't replied to any concerns about it just kind of rubs me the wrong way too. 
---
&gt; we will just have to wait and see how everything turns out.
---
For sure, it'll be interesting how it goes when they introduce them
---
This is excellent news, it's such a small thing, not really worth making a "can they fix it pls" post for it, so I'm really glad they caught it. It has been bothering me since launch.
---
There may be more, but the only company I have known to do something like this was PerfectWorld Entertainment. They had a marketplace where a player can exchange Cash Shop Currency into game currency like gold. 
---
It works like this, They post that they are exchanging $ for Gold at a rate of xG per. In fallout terms... exchanging Atoms (A) for caps at a rate of xC per.
---
So say I want to sell 2000 atom points in total. I would exchange 2000 A for caps at a rate of 200c per.
---
So a player can buy atom points from me, at a rate of 200c per atom point.  Yeah the 2000 in total would cost 400k caps.
---
But keep in mind, I low balled this. The rate in the game was 500 gold per Cash currency roughly. Which would amont to an easy million. Only end game players had millions. So this was a feature that allowed f2p end game players to farm gold and get cash currency for whatever they want to spend it on. It also allowed the people with $$$ to get lots of gold if they wish.
---
My camp literally hits the border on 3/4 of the circle.  Moving it even a couple feet would cause stuff on the edges to be out of bounds.  With that said I can see how it would be nice to be able to do.
---
Confirmed, was fixed in [Patch 6](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/21zDUJWJbcIyv2vKmvSSjB/fallout-76-patch-notes-february-19-2019), seems like it's back.
---
leveling;
---
Events, quests, and mob grinding.  *Most* areas will end up scaled to whoever's in the area, so that can include high level players causing lvl 40-62 common mobs and less frequent enemy types up to 80 (scorchbeast) and 91 (deathclaws).  Basically, always be doing stuff.  Even better once you get able to handle yourself solo.
---
Common grinding areas haven't changed much; it's still whitespring, west tek, watoga, the right side of the map in general.
---
The real "meta" of leveling comes down to making use of buffs like Well Rested &amp; Cranberry Relish/Cobbler, and being teamed for Inspirational.
---
The more recent Double EXP weekends - if they continue doing them - are nice too.  And if you don't mind PVP being enabled with no slap damage, there's also Survival mode for an extra 20%.
---
All of that said - leveling up to 50 is kind of grindy.  Leveling up past 50 starts feeling fun cuz all the equipment is available to you.  Past about 75 or 100 when you've got most of your desired perk cards, and it is less about your level and more about your gear &amp; perk loadout.
---
_____________________
---
Stuff that's changed, there's way too much in the patch notes to go over every little thing, and when you last played OP.
---
Major stuff...
---
* Stash is 800 - at launch it was 400.  It's an improvement, but still not really "enough".
---
* Duping is (mostly) fixed - The major exploits that plagued the game early are dealt with; it's bittersweet as there's still lots of duped weapons/armor in the trading markets.
---
* Crafting Alcohol - brewery/fermenting stations, and a brief questline, along with repeatable/daily quests to unlock more brewing recipes.
---
* PVP/Survival Beta - basically just a "pvp enabled always" mode with it's own separate servers.
---
* Cryptid Questline - most recent, and has a neat sleuth-style quest that leads to a neat (and very difficult/end gamey) event, along with a handful of sidequests to go with it.
---
You missed...
---
* Fasnacht Parade - which was a time-limited event with unique rewards; though most were cosmetic outfits or camp decorations, there were a couple of event-themed cooking recipes (not a significant worry; you'll be swimming in Glowing Meat anyway).
---
* Untold stuff in the atom shop - whether you agree with MTX or not, there's been quite a few items that have come &amp; gone through circulation.  Not all the skins, decor, and vanity/cosmetics are going to be available if you missed'em.
---
;;
---
There's been lots of other random bug fixes, but the game client still runs... less than optimally.  In the sense of minor performance hiccups, or mildly amusing physics/graphical glitches.  There's still fairly frequent CTD's, crash on quit to desktop, app hangs, inconsistent loading times, etc etc.
---
There's been a lot of updates and fixes to their servers; but there's still instances where it lags out incredibly, crashes the server, doesn't populate loot lists, generates invisible enemies, generates enemies behind walls/terrain.  There's likely always going to be some lag/delay with hit detection (it isn't FO4's more 'clean' gunplay, just due to it being online).
---
Bottom line is there's been quite a lot of fixes to both client &amp; server - but there's also quite a few that haven't been addressed since launch.  And I get the feeling that, without a very serious and intensive overhaul of both (client &amp; server), we'll probably continue getting bandaid fixes and little patches here or there, unless or until they decide to step up to Creation Engine X.0 ; else either start over with the NetImmerse/Gamebryo architecture (rather than build on Morrowind code), or license/develop a new engine to use.
---
I suppose if you aren’t paying attention
---
Have it documented on [Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup | Patch 8 | 04/03/209 (Wild Appalachia)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbp7wy/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch_8/)  
---
Nice work!
---
Forgot all about this post lol. Could you post pictures of each one if they’re still available?
---
Thanks for the tips. As a novice trader I need all the advice offered :)
---
I've done the event 4 times and been given two different jetpack plans but no mounted wildlife plans. I'll do the side quests and get the 2 I'm missing so thanks for that information!
---
Mod application fixed?
---
I'm lowish level (level 38) and I'm really glad they're adding such high-level challenging stuff. I still have plenty of the base quests to do, and it's nice to know that there will be more challenging things to do later (right now there's still a certain Wendigo Cave in my future). I'm not even sure I'm going to bother with the new event, at least using my one free recall card, until sometime down the road.
---
I’m not at the console at the moment, so I guess I’ll just ask. Is it possible to favorite more items than will fit on the quick access wheel?
---
Hope this got fixed in this morning downtime maintenance
---
If you're using any mods or custom ini, remove them.
---
Ya I'm hundreds and hundreds of hours in and still no dead witch lol
---
Do you have any mods, I know the number one issue people get after new patches is because of mods that don't play well.
---
It's cut, as are the quests for the time being.
---
There are a lot more events than the sheep. That is a good spot for there, as is the hills a little distance away- which also gives better FOV for exploda-bot sniping
---
No problem
---
I don’t think it should be automatically allowed when you level up, it just makes it too easy compared to many other restrictions in the game. However this can be done as a legendary mod drop which you can loot from legendary enemy. The mod will allow you do upgrade the level of one weapon of your choice.
---
Upvoting because it seems after completing roses quest line not much use for it 
---
It’s been mentioned it has potential to make
---
Ingame UX interesting 
---
If we could use syringer to deploy meds and buffs  to other players and NPC imagine nukashine based trips. On adventure and PvP mode!

Have an OP deathclaw or mirelurk, assaultron col gutsy? Bam! Bring your own version of DC BANE and slug It out!
---
I have damaged him with my gatling plasma  when he was attacking me while cloaked.
---
Thank you. Is there any evidence supporting this?
---
I have this issue right after I log in, sometimes it clears up after a minute or two, sometimes longer.
---
The difference is that this is  supposed to be taking place years before the other games. Other games where super mutants are  common and human/ kangaroo hybrids are nowhere to be found.
---
Anytime :)
---
[I solved the puzzle!](https://imgur.com/FFHGmo8) putting the stuff I unscrambled over the original screenshot, you can see the stuff on the screen is what the player is looking at, and this is most likely just a weird glitch.
---
The lore is to build one-person shacks in the wilderness? Also the lore is that everyone is from this one Vault, where they've lived together for 25 years, yet people are happy to murder each other for the metal caps that come on soda bottles.
---
my jump is bound differently BUT REbinds are ignored and default BACK in build mode (one of my biggest pet peeves in this game actually,since I have all my moving and strafing bound differently so I have to change how I do everything in build mode) so when I attach.... I still jump.  I guess my point is, even rebinding my keys doesn't help. ...with anything in build.
---
I didnt preplan a build either.  (For that matter, I didn't even know about that aspect of the game)
---
I installed the game, and I played.  Not having a plan in mind has not negatively impacted my enjoyment of the game...No stress about getting the "right" perks, etc.
---
   I chose perks that suited the need(s) I had a the time and the weapon that was working the best for me at the time.
---
In 76, the "perks that benefit the moment" process made me a melee build, with sniper as a secondary.  
---
In previous iterations of FO, I was always a gunner.  
---
Suprisingly, I rather like melee as a primary.
---
Good doggy perk wil help a lot with food issues, packrat with carry weight.
---
Learning where on the map you can go, and areas you should not be, will help reduce the number of times you die.  Stay in the forest until at least L15.  Then go to toxic valley.  Low20s, western edge of the divide, but be aware enemies will level depending on who else is around.  30s - ash heap.
---
40+, anywhere you want.
---
I've been overencumbered for a long time.  Actionboy/girl perk helps regen AP faster so you can move at a decent rate.
---
I don't really miss fast travel - lacking the ability forces me to walk and enjoy the scenery, as well as aids in discovering new locations.  
---
Have to admit it got worse @L30 when I started going into nuke zones, not running away from them - I had learned about farming legendaries...
---
Downside is the hoarder in me had me holding items above my level at the time - I didnt know if I'd ever see them again, so didn't want to dump them until I got to try them out.
---
Caps and levels will come as you explore and do events.  Once you get to the upper 20s low 30s, both will be faster.
---
Camp?  I dont think I've been back to my camp in at least a month. There are enough red rockets/train stations/workbenches around that I haven't really needed to go back.
---
Is the dungeon instanced?
---
The eyebots are bombs and they hurt.
---
I'm right there with you. I've been looking since yesterday through the wiki, game, and other posts in this subreddit, and it seems like the CLUE holotape was cut entirely, and those two quests are not implemented yet. May come next week with the addition of the Burrows dungeon, as that takes place in the Mire, as do those two missing quests. Bigger issue is where is the actual Sheepsquatch, and the event called "Free Range" or something similar, that is all about the Squatch.
---
Say it.
---
It's pretty much actually a Social Democracy and it's basically *the opposite* of "pretty shit" - the people there are quite happy with how things are going in their country.
---
Show me a single socialist country which does not have a serious corruption problem which is "pretty shit" - corruption is not a socialist specific problem, it's a problem with any country without strong regulations which protect the weak against the strong, free press, transparency in government and a functioning Democracy with term limits.
---
Even the 20s and 30s are MEAN AF. 
---
I’m a stealth rifle, and I want as much distance between them as I can
---
In the files, it doesn't actually have a place to spawn, and the other sidequests for Shear Terror were originally available through it as well, which is clearly no longer the case.
---
   
---
I remember when I was level 20, I went alone, I passed it very badly

No, you will wait!

Try using it in third person, you can at least have a crosshair that way

I don't know, I thought about this as well and it would just make you spend more time at your camp instead of exploring the world and hunting down the things you need, you know, playing the game. It's same reason why food spoils and equipment breaks, to force you out into the wasteland.
---
What I will say is that I think the game needs an ability to note or mark locations on the map where you can get certain supplies. Knowing where you can exactly get some Snaptail Reeds or some Glowing Resin or whatever would be nice. We can do that anyway on our own, but it's be nice if the game included some additional functionality like to aid in this.

“Food beds” I pictured my character sleeping atop a pile of melons
---
The side quests found in the taxidermy basement ...
---
If repair kits make you want to hate this game, move on. I won't buy them because they are also a random drop. You don't HAVE to buy anything since you earn atoms for free.
---
For some reason updating actually removed my mods (they were just some returxre mods for outfits) and I have reshape installed, would that affect it?
---
Isn't it hilarious how people downvote observations about the obvious shittiness of some aspects of this game? Talk about fucking Stockholm Syndrome.
---
Quick, everyone sell your best gear!
---
Still the same for me... ah well
---
Ive probably benefited from one of those drops :)
---
Thx!
---
The system is pretty shitty in terms of how much you get shafted if you want to do a rifle build and be able to stand up to a melee/shotgun build 😖
---
Well hopefully this gets enough up votes and Bethesda gets the atom purchase option up and running in Japan. Also random question what platform you on? Asking since would assume PC since to my knowledge its working for Xbox and ps players.
---
ty sir
---
I only join games to visit shops if the person has a mic. It's too difficult browsing there items and trying to discuss prices.  
---
On the other hand I don't mind the lack of mic if we agreed on an item and the price through the trade sub. 
---
Just my 2 cents
---
Who knows - maybe they are silent because they are changing them and want to announce something that will be more in line with their 'Cosmetics only' promise.
---
Ryan...join on me and I will craft you some for free.
---
Thanks for the Video, documenting and reporting!
---
That's why I'm proposing that Bethesda hard code change it. The initial wire connect is still that "Jump" button but when you're actually attaching it to a second connector, the key used instead will be the "Interact" button rather than the same "Jump" button. 
---
This would require Bethesda to go into their keybind configuration code and actually change the bind for that condition permanently which should be entirely possible.
---
Yeah same here 😤
---
I read more into it and Calvin was always obsessed with Sheepsquatch. I think he saw the real one once. There is a terminal entry about other fake Sheepsquatches that he made. And how he was using them to attract tourists. Pretty minor stuff. Doesn’t merit secret agents and killing cops. I think he was innocently using the Sheepsquatch as a way to make money, all while having a secret weird obsession with the real one. 
---
Whoever Bo-Peep and Wolf work for are cryptid Hunters. They have been looking for the real Sheepsquatch and their attention is grabbed by Calvin. They hire him for some sort of job and he leaves. 
---
When he comes back, he is now an (unwilling?) agent of Bysshe. And he uses his fake Sheepsquatches to try to lure out the real one. 
---
I’d have to read the medical note talking about Calvin’s insanity again but maybe it’s just a decoy. Or his sister took him and no one would believe him. 
---
That’s my best theory of this whole thing.
---
I think it’ll get better now that people are getting more familiar and info is spreading. . It took me three times showing up to that event before I had the slightest idea what the hell I was supposed to be doing, it was just total chaos.
---
Ah yes, good point! I almost died the first time I did the event, and couldn't quite figure out where all the damage was coming from.
---
“Just standing back the entire time” as opposed to strategically engaging enemies to play a valuable role for the team.  
---
There’s a difference.
---
It kinda helps.. untill you get megasquatched. Tried it. She just just brained me and i died..or the explodey bots greet you..
---
I've tried with normal armor with rad resist, plus stacked radshield, radx, diluted radx, and basically gotten my "Rad Resist" up to just as high, or higher than it is in any power armor, and it still goes up at a pretty unmanageable rate.
---
There's some kind of 'hidden' rad-resistance inside power armor and hazmat suits that makes them more effective than just the RadResistance# implies.
---
I use a hazmat suit and I'm fine ..always been..have PA..never liked it/used it
---
For sure. I lost a piece of equipped armor and have no idea what happened to it. Logged in and it was gone. Thaaaat's enough of this game for me.
---
You can craft legendary armor?
---
Always here to help the lower levels..psn is pirateglenn1
---
so, as of right now, there is only 4 active side quests ? (did them last night), and was kinda hoping there would be new once today :/ (after 24 hours)
---
You're an optimist lol
---
How about this fucking lag/staggering every 3seconds that makes game unplayable for a lot of ppl. And are worrying some repair kits that nobody is forcing you to buy
---
I agree this is annoying as hell, this falls more under Quality of Life.  
---
Will do a QoL Section, focusing on the bugs first!
---
Totally agree, hopefully in a further update we can get more crops and have them cost less building space so can have real farms plus barn building set would look great with it!
---
Imo there hasn't been a response because they're going to do it regardless of our opinions.
---
I have no clue, I don't play on pc and was just passing along info
---
He never asked for that and no..I can craft a certain amount. I won't do it for everyone though. Psn is pirateglenn1
---
&gt; What is End Game Loot in a game that is always progressing? Todays End Game Loot is the crap of tomorrow.
---
This is stupid logic. 
---
What is new monsters in a game that is always progressing? Todays new monsters are the old monsters of tomorrow.
---
What is new areas in a game that is always progressing? Todays new areas are the old areas of tomorrow.
---
What is new cosmetics in a game that is always progressing? Todays new cosmetics are the old cosmetics of tomorrow.
---
What is new lore in a game that is always progressing? Todays new lore is the old lore of tomorrow. 
---
What is new perks in a game that is always progressing? Todays new perks are the old perks of tomorrow.
---
Don't you think, ya know, that if a game is "always progressing" that they HAVE to add things that push it's progression? Things like weapons, things like new areas, things like new monsters?
---
Finally over? It was done for maybe an hour.
---
on Adventure mode, if both of you are in passive you don't have anything to worry about.  
---
If you are talking about Survival there are no protections at all, in any event.
---
Safety First!
---
I made a Survival character w/ cannibal so I wouldn't need to carry more aid items. Never played w/ it before, omg it's a game changer.
---
When you open the modify/repair dialog and select the weapon, it takes you to an inspect window now i believe, then you have to hit whatever key it says for "repair using workbench"
---
The Free States one just plopped down next to Freidrich really annoys the crap out of me. It's busy enough in there already. When there's someone trading with both bots it's so loud and repetitive
---
&gt; It's pretty much actually a Social Democracy and it's basically the opposite of "pretty shit" - the people there are quite happy with how things are going in their country.
---
It's a constitutional monarchy, period. And I was saying socialism is shit, not Denmark. 
---
&gt; Show me a single socialist country which does not have a serious corruption problem which is "pretty shit" - corruption is not a socialist specific problem, it's a problem with any country without strong regulations which protect the weak against the strong, free press, transparency in government and a functioning Democracy with term limits.
---
"Real communism hasn't been tried bro" lol, gtfo
---
Ah I see. So is it not added yet? Or was it cut. The wiki says the holotape can be found.
---
Hmmmmm good info, hopefully a few more people will pile on and confirm multiple instances of it!
---
In this case, you bet.  I want this game to keep improving and the repair kits to stay out of the Atomic Shop (unless they are free crafting recipes).
---
It’s not fixed for me.
---
Pretty sure they are thinking the 4 side quests are the sheep quest.  Which are all - side to side quests
---
Woo lets push this thread higher!
---
Fatboy Slim ... great video
---
well on ps4 when i made a new character there was a bunch of plans outside of vault 76. so I keep a list of plans i know on my main character and saw i knew most of them and left the rest plus some from my main

Judge Dredd: You killed innocent people.

Rico: The means to an end.

Judge Dredd: You started a massacre!

Judge Dredd: YOU BETRAYED THE LORE!
---
Rico: LLLOOOOOOOORRRRREEEEEE?
---
I see, I hadn't considered doing both - so items you'll be swapping at the top, items that you don't go at the bottom. I like it, I'll definitely look into that, thanks!
---
It’s really annoying, I’m tired of trying to wire up some lights and accidentally jumping off a cliff.
---
I'd say the only real "strategy" is manpower.  Most of the server showed up when I fought her and it wasn't that big of a deal.  And there were even quite a few people below level 50. But there was a shit ton of people and she went down pretty quick.
---
Oh yeah, you're right. I kinda forgot about Nintendo (and i own several). But there's no Fallout 76 on Nintendo anyways.
---
Wasn’t for me.
---
I mean, it def has a use in the SBQ fight, the endangerol syringer stacks, everyone there should be hitting it every 120 seconds to reduce her DR and she goes down pretty easy, that and psychotats and vats crits
---
**Question(s):**  
---
-Did you hotkey them from the Inventory?  
---
-If they are still Hotkeyed do they not respond when clicked on?
---
This is the real spoiler.
---
Okay, but you're a moderator with a job to do here, I don't know you and obviously don't mean anything personally towards you as a person so please don't get pissed and sarcastic about it. The reason I tagged you is because you're the mod who posted the megathread, so you're the only one who's talked to this community recently and the only one I can see is active here recently. There's 8 other mods who must not all have PhD presentations, but I don't know or hear from any of them or even know if they're actually here or active at all. 
---
Theres a team of 9 moderators, so I'm not saying it has to be *you* but I am saying this sub has seen very very little moderation and I'm sure you could agree. A major DLC just dropped and there's major story spoilers all over the front page within 24 hours. Again I'm not pinning it on you, there is a team of 9 moderators and I believe someone should have had an eye on this sub the day after a major DLC releases. People in our community are getting angry and avoiding this subreddit now.
---
If My plan is to farm I use a hazmat suit but will go with friends.
---
The Scorchbeasts are more insect in nature than they are bat. One giant queen controls her worker bats. One female per nest.
---
yeahhh. i was told that the patch note post by the community manager was "not the place" for Bethesda to comment on the backlash. Apparently their weekly blog isn't either.
---
Welp, everyone who had chromotography-based humble brag on their FO76 subreddit bingo card, go ahead and cover your squares.  :)
---
Yeah but if you know tyou have a favorite item that *can* be scrapped you should be careful anyway, then to see a pop up box come up saying your going to scrap a favorite and making you choose a different button to actually scrap the thing if you were spamming should make you slow down even more and think, "oh shit, I almost scrapped my favorite gun" and not just rely on instinct and muscle memory to start smashing buttons
---
Pure florescent Flux is at a premium right now. Guess I'm going to be launching me some nukes
---
Yea lets hope this thread gets some traction and Bethesda then does a better placement for these vendor bots.
---
Agree to disagree.  Well, me and approx 2,000 other people judging by the upvotes.  Prior to this post I actually thought I was the minority.  Clearly not.
---
Yeah. I have cannibal, ghoulish and sun kissed. So when I eat, the healing is extreme and during the day, all the radiation dissipates. Also makes me near indestructible against glowing enemies or in nuke zones.
---
I believe it was 200 upon launch. Still, those were brutal times haha.
---
You get the buffs from any food you eat, but only meat will satisfy your hunger
---
Or how about higher chances for legendaries that are worth a damn. I'd rather have that first. I'm tired wasting resources fighting 3\* and getting a wooden armor piece that helps me be resistant from insects... For real. I'm level 60 and the best weapons I have are a vampiric sledge I attached the rocketed mod to and an instigating handmade, but it's level 35.
---
Thats a shame so no way for me prevent high lvl players from kicking me out of doing the event.
---
I tend to stay away from trade subs and just use the lfg system on Xbox. When I buy from people the vast majority just send a game invite and we never speak using voice. I've had to many issues with party chat trading, where the seller will have his friend try to bid against me to raise the price of an item or invite many people to bid amongst themselves. Some people may enjoy having to shout over everyone else to get your item, but I much rather text. It's easy to end a trade there and then without any hard feelings
---
7rads per second even with 1k radrezist.
---
That would be very nice, didn’t think about the legendary vendor doing that
---
its the way its always been, before it was 200 caps per vender faction per 20 hours, now its 1400. So the people that would wipe out all the bots before you can get to them can do do it all at one easy location. I dont see this as being benefical
---
Likewise, used them well in FO4 and for the first time just last night. Through 3different walls.
---
Probably cut. The wiki isn't official, so sometimes it's wrong.
---
the point is that it is a gateway. they ease us into it with items that affect gameplay, but don't drastically change it. its a very slippery slope that, if we don't speak out against it, could lead to shit like perk cards or legendary vendor tokens in the atom shop.
---
on top of it, it is pretty fucked up for them to stress so hard that purchasable items will be cosmetic only, just for them to turn around and do this shit.
---
Failed event in Survival.  Had seven quest markers advising me to amend my littering ways.  They disappeared a second after I noticed them, thanks to some conscientious soul cleaning up after my slovenly corpse 😂.  So nice to know sanitation remains a priority!
---
I mean yeah I guess they could have used a different key, but at the very least it should slow you down enough to stop and make a rational decision now
---
BE minigun tears her ass up. 
---
Defenently the way to go on this hunt
---
Hi there! We are aware and looking into this
---
If it's part of a chem recipe you need to scavage for it and cant farm it, same rule as fallout 4.  Certain plants are supposed to be rare.   The need to spend time collecting them as well as the potential hazards you encounter while collecting are things the devs spent time thinking about.  If a recipe requires plants from two different regions you're not supposed to be able to sit in your CAMP and make the recipe several times an hour while spending(stimpacks, materials on repairs, bullets, etc) virtually nothing.
---
Have heard that CAMPs will be made invulnerable in adventure mode in the future.  Is this accurate and if so when?
---
Another player explained to me that you get the benefits but not the hunger reduction. But I never make food items outside of the basics.

Oh good lord this sub is filled with pathetic people isn't it? This sub has been begging people to tag spoilers properly and I was just doing my part. Suck a dick, go "roleplay" as a brotherhood scribe you fucking faggot.

We can definitely bring that up, thank you.

My first build was a max damage melee and oh boy was it frustrating at end game. I even kept getting killed by mole rats because I kept my health low because of damage-boosting perks that only work with low health. Now I'm working towards a power armor build which is much more sturdy and don't have to worry about getting killed so easily. I'll probably not go back to my melee character until I get a full set of Unyielding Cavialer armor so I don't keep getting killed by mole rats, which I'm pretty sure will take a long time to get.
---
Tyvm for the reply! Appreciate it!
---
The road map was for the entire year, not just Wild Appalachia
---
Would you build one for me at my C.A.M.P.?
---
I’ll probably move once I’m done with my current quest. But its more convenient for me to camp out there for now. 
---
I just don’t understand people’s hostilities...
---
If you actually hover over the "level up 3 times" challenge, it shows a list of possible ways to complete it.  I forget exactly what they are, but I managed to complete it in one go by being over level 76, killing bots in watoga while wearing a veil of secrets.
---
I'm honestly not mad about the increased challenge for daily and weekly quests.  Not so long ago I'd get half of them done without even looking at the challenges because they were so easy.  "Pick 3 mutfruit" or "kill a super mutant".  I blew through 3000+ atoms with the camo bundle, lever gun skin and West Virginia power armor paint, so I'm actually kinda trying to earn more.  I went out of my way to gather a giant pile of snaptails the other day in the interest of making 15 different kinds of booze and found Mr. Squeeze while I was at it.  I recorded [a little video of his dialogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4gTpg0JB3E&amp;t=31s), which I find hilarious.
---
Square on PS4 IIRC
---
i want it now.
---
I'm referring to the specific wild Appalachia roadmap which gave a detailed breakdown and tentative dates.
---
I've never had that experience with the player shops. Sometimes you get more trades going if you can talk over the mic. I've solds many plans, maps, and ammo that way. It's honestly my preferred way. I have no problem denying a trade a walking away if they act like a jackass.
---
Documented and report, thanks
---
VERY Helpful, thank you!
---
I would love an online hub for sharing pictures with other users. Like GTA and Forza. Looking forward to both these updates.
---
Sorry I’m on PS4, would otherwise.
---
As a survivor of Lyme disease, I would burn down every tick nest I came across. It already triggers my PTSD every time I see one of those giant mutated monstrosities.
---
Its very possible that they choose to just pretend they never said that and not stir the pot, they could just bypass the repair kits in the atom store like with the whole lunchbox thing
---
They're never going to let you sell atom shop crafted items to other players. That just makes you their competition and technically nothing would stop you from Just crafting the item and giving thousands away.
---
their response is that it's happening.
---
Oh, I did not realize you played Survival. But somehow, that's lore accurate.
---
What road map are you looking at?
---
I've had good experiences too, but I've had too many times where I was ready to jump on an item and the seller wouldn't sell because I wouldn't join his party. Some People are strange.
---
Yeah, your options for nuke zones are literally Power Armor or Hazmat (no armor)
---
YES!!! FO4 was the same.
---
I don't think they ever fixed that did that? (vs bug that creeped back in)
---
You’re right, could’ve used any of the other 5+ buttons to accept.  Y, or triangle.  RT/RB... etc.  How many favorited items do you want to scrap, maybe just make it impossible to scrap a favorited and rather just unfavorite it first.
---
Yes my point is they add those because of whales because suddenly they have more of a reason to spend money
---
Cool- good luck with school!
---
Thanks will try to replicate and hopefully some people will pile on!
---
Ya for sure.
---
I think it's clear what's going to happen.
---
The games launch was a disaster, sales have crashed thereafter. Bethesda needs to make money off this or at least break even. With free DLC the only option remaining is via the Atom store.
---
I suspect they'll take it to steam once all is up and stable as not to mess up locally ratings. It will be sold cheap, maybe free and the atom shop will be the main source of income. A launch 2.0 if you so will.
---
Do you disagree? How do you guys'n'gals think Bethesda will proceed?
---
If they added these I am going to be irritated. I don't cap farm, so it has taken a lot of saving to get the 7600 to buy that plan. Which I just bought last week.
---

---
A buddy of mine had the same issue but i walked him through the whole quest with out the markers and he was able to beat it with out it active it just seems to not be showing up you can do it but you gotta guess really
---
It's fine if you don't like pvp, but workshops don't work without being contestable for reasons that are pretty obvious.
---
Ohhhhh tough call, Working as Intended or..... 
---
Question can you target them outside of VATS and hold the target going in?
---
I think it'd be pretty cool to switch between both ballistics and energy, if it were possible. That way I get to diversify more and use up varying ammo types too.
---
For now I think I'm more leaning toward ballistics early on as I move onto Big Guns. I have more ammo planned for them. Got a tonne of gunpowder stocked up, as well as lead/steel for making ammo. I've been hoarding them til I get the perks that increase ammo crafting amounts as well as that level 50 perk that gives a chance of more crafted items.
---
As of this moment I've finally seen my first Big Gun skills. One Gun Army in Luck and the Big Gun damage in Strength. But I've not got no heavy weapons on me (they're heavy) or much total ammo, so I've been still getting melee perks for the sake of making it my backup and having it be efficient for when I need it, plus it'll help me kill and level faster and that will make me progress faster toward building up the Big Guns.
---
I'm always on the roof because I'm a stealth/vats sniper... and that's the only place I can maintain stealth bonus vats crits... 
---
But if these people think the roof is completely safe... I got some bad news... LOL
---
Nice. Cant wait for that. Ive always liked their insignia.
---
It does **not** apply to dropping
---
Delay all the things
---
Okay, thanks anyway!
---
You can always check the trade subs. Just put out a want to buy post
---
Not a fan of this quest line. Run around to different places, find stuff, realize everyone's dead (shocking), and then it abruptly ends. I had to come here to figure out that you then get to do an event (supposedly -- still haven't found an available event yet). Just not good design. The one thing I liked was the washer-dryer puzzle. I wish they'd give us more of those sorts of challenges -- make us go back and read the notes and figure things out.
---
I just don't see them taking that route from a game design angle either. They mentioned it's geared towards end game players wanting to get their dream weapon, so just having a legendary roulette game where you pay tokens to gamble on a completely random item doesn't fit in with that. It's probably part of it, but I think there will be a couple of different ways to use the tokens. Otherwise it'll just be a dull, repetitive lottery system that doesn't really add anything interesting to the game. It also wouldn't really be that different to the current method of farming legendaries.
---
Related but not the same: Every once in a while, just to keep it clean, I grab every junk item out of the stash and hit scrap all. gets that odd piece here and there that slips through. Sometimes it makes a very noticeable impact on total weight.
---
Oh, yeah, that. Just marketing speak that doesn't really give us anything one way or the other. I thought you were saying there was another interview or something with more info.
---
I Use my power armor like a vehicle to transfer stuff lol
---
the game already scales instances to the highest players level.
---
what this means, is that the minimum enemy level is 50.
---
Sounds like a bug reported on PS, where ground textures won't load, documenting and reporting, thanks!
---
JFC I read all of that
---
That sucks and yeah I’m reading that everywhere.
---
The machine is completely blank. I enter it and it shows Cryptos System at top and where their should be dialogue or choice (Select NewUser VS found holotapes) are absent.
---
They could just add more cosmetics and stick to their promises. They may make money off the whales now, but long lterm they're screwing themselves. The launch was already a disaster and walking back on promises made will lead to a lot of fans not trusting Bethesda going forward. This can/will lead to people holding off on buying the next game due to a lack of trust.
---
Oh okay I see what you mean now. I assume we'll get something similar at the start of the new seasons.
---
I would wait until the Event ends, because it's kinda a dick move not letting people get their items back. After that, and when the remaning bots are out of the way, i would pick up everything.   
---
Sure people just should store away their junk, before joning the event. Tbh when i see something that i need very urgent, like screws, i will steal it after some time. 
---
Overall it's a dick move but they can't punish you, when beeing a dick. When outside of an event and a player dies, i won't pick up their junk, when they spawn nearby. Sure when they don't go straight to their junk, well bad luck for them.
---
If u are mutated u will need starched genes maxed
---
Also, here’s an interesting thing that relates.
---
[the noclip documentary on Fallout 76 before release](https://youtu.be/gi8PTAJ2Hjs). Skip to 11.23. 
---
Nate Perkeypile says:
---
"Because it’s closer to when the bombs actually detonated, so there’s more radiation. So you can get crazier mutations, and giant plants because it’s more irradiated at that time."
---
He also said:
---
"Well I didn’t see that in future fallouts-  
---
Well maybe it’s just such a bad mutation that they died out, but here, it still exists in full swing"
---
I realise people will just comment on the realism or something, but it’s a sci-fi game, things are allowed to just be fun sometimes.
---
I've done this two nights in a row and both times got a 1\* cloaking wood chest. Also got the mask both times as well. I've never complained about drops before but this is just insulting. And this is the first time I've ever died during an event. EVER. Normally I'll try events if I'm in the area even if the odds are against me, but after that, I saw it pop up again and after 5 min no one was there so I didn't even try. No thanks, I'm not a masochist.
---
I thought you couldn’t stack meds/chems??
---
Yep.  All 5 characters maxed caps in 25 minutes.  This use to take 2 hrs with hats and fast travel.  A huge improvement for me.
---
Yeah definetly good change. I spent about 30k on power armor plans a few weeks prior to the update. Would have saved me thousands. But I don't mind, caps are easy and with the update much more enjoyable to trade with bots.
---
*nod* Documented and reported, thanks for the info!
---
Probably something to do with the Burrows
---
Seems like there is a "Global" issue breaking quests, documented and reported!
---
Awesome, thanks for this! Gives me a good perspective of what to look for. I didn't really think about explosives due to the fact right now I pick up mini-nukes for 6 pounds each, missiles for 2 pounds each, etc. Just really is crazy how heavy they are. Grenades and such are pretty heavy too and add up.
---
Ordnance is pretty crazy with how much weight it'd reduce. I'll have to keep it in mind. I've only started getting into the Big Guns perks so I may as well finish melee perks, start building Big Guns as I find them more/gain more ammo for them, then start possibly building toward more explosives on top.
---
Thanks again!
---
Head southeast from the train station nearest to Top of the World. You can see the billboard if you look left while heading south.
---
How does that work though? I’ve noticed several extremely high level players on the map but have never came across enemies higher than 91.
---
Is the open World capped because of so many players and different levels?
---
Like if I walked into the burrows completely alone at say level 105, could I expect everything to be 105?
---
Yeah most likely, reading a terminal rn thats linked to West Tek
---
Question is this happening when Fast traveling?
---
It does **not** apply to selling
---
I've been there weeks ago, but then another day I tried to find it again and I couldn't.
---
Unfortunately not
---
I went with "History's Repeater" for my gatling gun
---
This was a while ago, maybe they patched it, but I think there was a while where the different rad-resist stuff did actually stack.
---
no, space will now make it keep the weapon, you have to press your TAB key to scrap it
---
Okay but 20 hours since you were on zero caps? Or 20 hours since?
---
Currently there no mobs higher than 90something that spawn in the world.
---
I feel like that has always been there, isn't that part of the freestates quest line?
---
Yeah still the same for me as well. I’ll be back at Patch 9 to see if anything changed. It’s unplayable currently.
---
to be fair, so far they've only pushed back little side features - player vending, camera. id rather that then the actual content, and actually would rather things be pushed back then get them unfinished anyway.
---
Really? This is my first time finding it! And I've played for 400 hours hah
---
What is that armor on guy with .50 caliber???
---
Yeah this would be nice.   Make it an option only available to the team leader so you have to have already been on the server to initiate it, also you can't just randomly jump onto a team and drag it to a different server (that would be an interesting way to free up a workshop though)
---
More workshop stuff in general really, feels very limited compared to the stuff we had in 4.
---
Don't think so, it's not tied to any quest and it belongs to west tek
---
As an update on this, we're looking into a couple of different things we can do to make this better. For example, we're going to allow Nuke Zones to count toward Rad Storm challenge progress with an upcoming patch.
---
No. It does not.
---
I would like to kno this as well
---
Then stop being a mod for a subreddit if you don’t have time for it, whatever it is your doing, step down, you clearly sound like you’re done for.
---
Yeah I was curious about this also, the highest I can see consistently is a Deathclaw at Emmet Mountain, he’s higher level than the Scorch Queen, 🤔
---
In Survival, the only time I jack someone's paper bags is if I'm either literally the only one being a Pylon or I'm the only person bothering wasting stims to revive other players.
---
I suspect this will be coming with the camera update, or the camp decorating update next month. Hopefully so, missed opportunity otherwise.
---
Oh, I thought it was a personal cooldown. Or was it both or something. I've heard someone say before "I just launched a nuke so I can't" I thought.
---
Definitely been there before, and it feels like I went there months ago.
---
So is that different from the one that has a bathroom scale connected to fragmentation grenades when you step on it at the bottom at the stairwell before you get to the big door?
---
&gt; it's apologist posts like this that make people feel like it's fine, right before we turn around and see TSE's in the shop.
---
Way to hyperbole.
---
There are other ways in progression than higher, faster, longer.
---
Aww really? I thought it was new never saw it in my life..
---
That's always been there sorry dude. Think I even went there in the beta lmao
---
Reported
---
What level because the sbq goes to 95. Highest Ive seen was 91 for deathclaws.
---
You dont have to launch a nuke...
---
Old as heck issue, will include on the next Weapons round up
---
It was there... :) Tnx!
---
If it's the one I'm thinking about in the back left corner should be a box of empty IV bags
---
Did it work properly before this patch?
---
This is an hilariously “don’t give a fuck” pic. 
---
Like, “just set it here on the dishwasher, snap a shot of the top of its head in front of an empty pickle jar and a roll of tape...aaaand perfect!”
---
it's new armor
---
That was my first thought.  It looks like assaultron armor.
---
Thank you, we're investigating this now. Can you tell me if the hotfix we put out today helped this at all in the meantime?
---
Do you have Adrenal Reaction and Class Freak?
---
Got Lamp?
---
Adrenal Reaction and Class Freak by chance?
---
Hmm, maybe I’m misremembering, only fought the Queen twice, perhaps you’re right.
---
Yeah the ‘claw is 91, so rightfully so the Queen must be highest mob in the game currently.
---
Will be kinda funny though if The Burrows scales right up with the player so you’re walking into level 287 Radroachs or some shit.
---
Oh yep there is. Aww darn it, thought I found something new XD
---
Same page.
---
Thank you. I was googling away and found nothing. 
---
The mvp 👍
---
yeah, it is hyperbole. who's to say it's impossible though? letting them slide with bullshit could lead us to that result or something close. 
---
i really don't understand why people are fighting others wanting to keep the game fair.
---
Thank you for the feedback! We will bring this up to the team.
---
i would assume so, yes.
---
I have made the Nukashine, but Biv won’t take it. He just repeats his dialogue. I logged out during the gather ingredients part, came back to wrap up the quest but he won’t take the Nukashine etc.
---
Yep, and yeah it's been here a while, woops, in my 400 hours I need to be more observant XD
---
I go there since launch
---
That’s also correct yes.
---
Yeah realised whoops.. Oh well
---
No big deal, game world is pretty massive!
---
Fuck! Cheers
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Rescue_diver_suit
---
Sometimes I run around with only a dress, using only one Radshield and lvl 3 Rad Sponge. Friends with me obviously!
---
i've definitely been there before
---
Great details, let me try and replicate!  
---
7) The Vim! power armor paint disappears upon learning the plan. (tried to learn it in January. Still no effect)  
---
This is an item gotten via Exploit, from the QASmoke Dev room, it won't work likely until it's added to the game.  
---
8) Bird Bones + Strange in Numbers results in inconsistent falling patterns. The player can achieve transcendence and fly for varying periods.  
---
Strange In Numbers Bug is back.  
---
10) Survival now has a small chance to drop ALL aid. Aid menu was empty after having 20 different items with 20+ of each. Found the bag later, but this is annoying.  
---
Holy crap, hopefully some more people will weight in with more details.  
---
Did you only die once?
---
What legendaries are you looking for, and what level? I have a few characters I don't use anymore so I prob have some decent stuff floating around
---
Yeah, oh well at least I've got some terminals to catch up on XD
---
Hopefully they tweak them to be something higher for a specific areas. If they keep the same format for enemy leveling now, this is going to be a solo dungeon. Not much a high level player cant take down in a couple shots.
---
I've had nothing but positive experiences with r/market76
---
I posted about this recently (Prior to the latest patch) - I have had a hard time gathering HRF, but not so much trouble with Glowing or Hardened Mass.  I haven't done any nuke runs post-patch yet, but I was glad to see that Glowing &amp; Hardened Mass are now instanced.  I got tired of seeing it disappear when someone grabbed it out of a body we had both tagged.
---
It didn't say so in the patch notes, but are HRF also instanced now?
---
You fucks did make the scorchbeast queen doe.
---
Rename title to "Here is the fastest way to be a dick"
---
Same here, just cant stand the stagger and freezing. Man this bethesda must be one of the worst companies ever to manage their games
---
Removed the custom .ini fixed it right away, thank you so much!
---
Traders are your friend. Theres always people selling or even trading weapons. You'd be surprised what you can do with some caps, flux or bulk junk/ammo.
---
Heyyyy, I had already given up hope.
---
It was the first thing I thought of when I read "Weapon of choice" and "aerial".
---
Yup, almost feels like they trying disperse players from WhiteSpring, I rarely bother anymore because the game is so nerfed and continues on a downhill spiral. There is really no need for them to nerf this stuff making the game more grind and unenjoyable because of this stealth changes. Yes they mentioned the instanced loots but only because they broke it by stealth changing it before instead of putting it back the way it was, really disappointing.
---
It’s a great place to farm for chems and chance for Plans in the locked safes.  I have found a lot of high value weapon plans on the basement locked safe.
---
Weird, I’ve only played it a couple times but people were reviving each other left and right.
---
Does anyone know if the photo gallery capacity is going to remain the same size? I don't recall seeing this anywhere but I could be mistaken. Not sure about anyone else but I'm always nearly maxed out.
---
Still a great place to stock on meds especially med X
---
Yes I do.
---
The farcical way of repairing weapons hasn’t been fixed either :(
---
Did you use the fermenter in bivs basement yet and read the note
---
With my setup I buy the chip for my group of 6, everyone chips in 300 caps, everyone does it!
---
I'd love that. I'll be on tonight when I get back from work. What's your gamertag?
---
This sounds neat. It could be a way to counteract a Nuke. Place a GECK and it clears the area. Or the radiation and Nuke Zone stay until one is placed
---
You got it right, I recognized that badass car harbor diving suit a mile away
---
Also crafting/fixing it is rather simple, considering it's an end-game event.
---
You can make the argument that super heated plasma and burning energy would be enough to melt through armor (thus providing armor penetration).
---
Mothman hasn't been explained but the Grafton Monster is an FeV experiment by WestTek. They had it sedated and transported off site then the bombs fell mid transit and the monster escaped. Doesn't explain how the hell it multiplied though as it wasn't standard a FEV experiment so super mutants in Huntsville aren't to blame.
---
yeah im starting to feel it. i love taking pics in the game. im hoping they increase the capacity, and maybe even give an option to auto save as a screenshot. i hate having to go through my gallery and screen shot my captures manually.
---
Ok thank you will do
---
Great question!  
---
This is for bugs introduced / reintroduced in Patch 8 (Primarily)  
---
 *Recon scopes won’t show the pip while scoped in. They do when you  unzoom, but that is kind of backwards (actually I haven’t verified if  this continues in patch 8, but it’s been a thing since patch 7, maybe  even 6)*   
---
Good info...  
---
 *Regular armor mod that reduce power attack cost (aerodynamic? ) don’t  stack, so having both arms Aerodynamic is wasted. Possibly intended,  possibly a bug. If intended, it should have some note saying as such.*   
---
Don't see built in limits, can you give me some hard numbers (AP with pre attack, PA with no reduction, with 1, with 2).. (I don't wear armor)  
---
*Energy weapons still don’t work with armor reducing effects. And I haven’t even heard this be acknowledge by Bethesda.*  
---
Known issue, reported multiple times and I've got it on my last weapons round up, will do another soon.  
---
*Cap stash detector noise still plays on  empty cap stashes. With so much being personal instanced world loot now,  I feel like they should just revert the container change they made to  cap stashes and just make them personal instanced loot.*  
---
Hmmm Thats a pain..
---
 Medium recon scopes still don’t exist. Just... why. Long is useless, short is fine but it’s... short.   
---
Never noticed that, odd...
---
The funny thing is it’s never busy work to me. It’s like he knows hat I have on me. I would say 90% of the quests I’ve down for him I can complete without leaving as he usually asks for whatever my previous reward was. It’s been pretty simple. I’ve only actually had to go to go search for ingredients 2 or 3 times.
---
Yes, with and without wearing any armor above the wetsuit will show gloves when worn. Just when an outfit that covers both the armor pieces and the underarmor do the gloves not show.
---
That about jibes with what I had read, but just wanted some feedback from some of of those with the mutation or from someone they knew that was running it.  Thanks for replying.
---
PC
---
You can't fully see but in the pictures I had 55% full health and then on the last pic I had 75% health. The explosive weapons were doing more damage at 75% than they were at 55% full health. Adrenal reaction only kicks on on very low health so I'm not sure how it relates but it's possible.
---
Oh nice!
---
So, I made a stab at the Sheepsquatch quest but the final battle failed.  
---
And now I can't run it again since it erases a part I need to initiate the thing.  
---
How do you go about getting another? The location where I got the first one no longer has it.  
---
Ack!
---
That safe has been there a long time, I remember finding it back before they added (Known) to plans.
---
It's a AtomStore paint.
---
Did they ever fix it?
---
True, but you would need a big laser for that dependent on armor. Metal would hurt its wearer for obvious reasons, but leather would be impenetrable
---
Planters should just act like those in game. Plant 1 item and the little planter has 3 little carrots. They have all of the grow boxes for all of the foods. Saw a tower yesterday and on the way up it had a bunch of planters. It would be so nice to have these. Could just be an unlockable for that overgrown plant vault.
---
On the food tab you can plant the tomatoe planter.
---
You can try to reverse your action: instead of selecting generator first, connect to connector. Select connector first, and connect to generator. That usually works for me. But yea. It's damn annoying.
---
1. Survival is the same game, but with no PvP limitations, a little more risk and less fast travel. Many players treat it as a Battle Royale, but it doesn’t have to be. Most shoot on sight fighting happens in small hotspots around train stations. Avoid those and you can pretty much play normally, albeit with the occasional tense encounter with other players—which may or may not result in murder. 
---
2. I’m sure there are Discords for PC (I’m on Xbox), I’ve also seen people just post here that they’re looking for a group and it appears to go well. 
---
3. You’re welcome.
---
As of yesterday it is still bugged out
---
That bugs me so much!!! If there's anything I'd want captions on, it's a super long radio drama!!
---
If the design is to give you +200 lbs, then it works right when you log in, but it glitches out when you get out of the suit because you only get +100 from then on.
---
If the design is to give +100 lbs, then it's glitched when you log in.
---
I can't see any logical reason for it to be the way it is, it's certainly glitched if you ask me.
---
It also makes no sense as to why they are there. Rival faction bots decided it was cool to just all go to The Whitesprings at the same time in order to loiter around in some random shop. 
---
I imagine it took less than an hour from inception of the idea to implementation with almost no thought at all given to it. Feels like a crappy mod that got downloaded from the Nexus.
---
I ‘m on Xbox btw man sorry. I used them from the favorites menu often in pvp. Neither one works that way anymore. Idk about the phantom device. I don’t use it. Also I don’t know if it is intended or not but the faction vendors at whitesprings don’t sell mods.
---
Or that deathclaw fighting ants at the substation north of Watoga.  Toss a grenade in there to tag the enemies and you're basically done.  You're guaranteed to get ants there every time.  If you can kill the deathclaw right away, I think there's five ants in just that one spot.
---
Whenever they release an update, the custom ini will need some tweaking. The fancy white fedora was all pink for me until I updated mine.
---
Sure the mods files on nexus have been updated by now to reflect the changes
---
The Heavy Weapons bug I've got documented and reported, thanks for piling on and confirming the issue!  
---
Have you tried tweaking your settings?  
---
Just curious for troubleshooting purposes
---
Yeah, no change for me either.
---
I have 41 supply drop holotapes and several dozen treasure maps ready for a time they are worth doing.
---
Pain I know, but sometimes it required post patch.
---
It has always been there.  Read the logs for hilarious testing results on the auto-doc.
---
Survival Mode is what you make of it.  I can go hours without a player encounter;  I can still trade with some players, but the added suspense from my uncertainty of their intentions adds more to the game; and of course, when I’m looking for a fight I know I can always head to a couple of areas.
---
I’m not on PC so I can’t help you there.
---
Number 3 wasn’t a question.
---
No, it's a serious pain
---
I'd call you a cunt, but you lack the depth and warmth.
---
Seriously. I’ve done a bunch of photo mode closeups to get detail shots for costumes and keep having to stop and wait for things to upload to my Xbox captures so I can delete them and take more.
---
if energy weapons in Fallout can disintegrate enemies into piles of ash or bubbling puddles of goo... they're *probably* doing enough damage to take down some armor.
---
Fallout 76 fans are the Flat Earthers of the gaming community.
---
Thanks for the info!  
---
*nod* the logon issue is a pain, reported on another thread  
---
Don't jump while exiting the pipboy.....
---
"moving us towards a system where we can earn them but only by devoting far too much playtime towards the task"
---
Isn't this the foundation of the games as a service model?
---
Leather is just treated flesh. If you can burn through metal, you can surely burn through leather with an adequate laser or plasma and these aren't exactly small.
---
True story.  Sometimes I sit there and have to kill maybe 2 enemies per "wave" and other times its almost more than I can handle.  A lot of events are like that.  Uranium Fever by yourself with 6-7 miners beating down one extractor or Census Violence with a half dozen bloatflies zooming everywhere.
---
i think they boosted the rates so they can push the new fridge and the new cooler backpacks
---
I've tried this, the problem like all the other little tricks I've tried is that it's selective still when it wants to work, bringing me back to square one.
---
Ouch......   
---
Will post when some more players pile on, hoping we can isolate to platforms.
---
I seen this in action, and it makes seriously regret getting rid of a two shot cryolator
---
Thank you! But fir real, why is there no button prompt telling you this?
---
But...
---
PROTECT AND SERVE!
---
He said "take a peek at my wood" lmao
---
If someone goes dies while being a conduit it severs the connection and someone has to run over and grab it again. But, while they're in that critically wounded state they continue to channel the energy until they actually die and respawn, so I try to let them hang for 15-20 seconds and then revive them.
---
u gots to BUY dem atoms son
---
Been around since B.E.T.A.    
---
Seriously annoying!
---
This is a great idea bcuz it'll bring life to Appalachia because it'll make staking your camp in different areas meaningful. You should def make this idea its own post!!
---
Whoa.  Take a deep breath, count to five and slowly release, bruh.
---
*nod* Ping me later and I'll start a QoL section once the bugs slow down (focusing on those first, I have 10 pages this morning of messages and PM's from this thread... ugh)
---
I'm sure you'll start seeing Grahm find a nice place to stand all day in the toy store soon and a lemonade stand will set up a permanent home next to the food vendors. 
---
Then the game will be renamed 'The Whitesprings: A Fallout Game'.
---
So you’re complaining based on a one time experience? You’re raging to fast, make sure it’s a real « Besthesda issue » before posting such messages. If it’s not a one time thing, then tell us how many times it happened.
---
please remove pete hines wiener from your mouth
---
Yeah the biggest thing is getting all the recipes. I’ve still got a couple I haven’t received. But usually when I do get the ‘craft a rad ant lager’ or whatever it may be, I’ll gather ingredients for as many as I can craft, then I have in my inventory for another time too.
---
your English is better than most Americans yo
---
I think they will find the most financially viable way to move forward, and as the community that wants to play the game with free dlc I think we should support them to a degree, I’m all for certain non cosmetic items being sold, however no loot(lunch) boxes that supply guns, armour or caps should be allowed
---
I've mostly heard other British accents here (where I'm from) and assumed it grouped us together for latency. I trade a lot though, so have met people from all over.
---
As I have done this on pc a suggestion for the ring: you can put support posts or something similar on the corners and attach wires to make it more like a real ring with "ropes". Also allows for better viewing of the fights. Then just make sure you blue print the rings and seating.
---
20 hours from when you first sell an item after a reset.  For example you can sell a junk item for 1 cap at noon to start the timer, then keep selling stuff all day, and the pool will reset to 1400 caps at 8:00am the next day.
---
Fair enough. I feel your pain, bro.
---
Yes this is a known issue across all platforms. Hopefully a hotfix comes soon
---
Cuck
---
I'm having the same issue.  I cannot attach my Jet Pack mod to my Prototype X-01 Torso.  I have the Power Smith perk loaded.
---
How long has this been an issue?  I hope it can get fixed soon.
---
While we're at it, a healing grenade would be neat.
---
I love this idea. Really makes me think of Ana from Overwatch
---
I haven’t even had to do that. I literally just got what he wants as a reward for the previous quest. He has given me lead champagne like 6 times, and I only just got the recipe the other day. And he asks for it often from me. Same thing happens with tic blood tequila, and I still don’t have that recipe.
---
HEY
---
Great idea!
---
I'd imagine making use of Green Thumb for the mundane stuff. Aquaboy for the aquatic plants. Science, Pharmacist, etc. for the more rare or medicinally inclined plants.
---
Artillery can not be used in your own camp. It has to be far away from the artillery piece. I’ve spent a lot of time playing with it
---
Yes?
---
Note's been there prior to Wild Appalachia. I have it in my stash.
---
I'm assuming sometime in may but it would be nice for them to at least confirm that we are getting something. That's primarily what I'm after
---
I used mine last night and it's effective on it, I used the explosive version so it was easier to keep my distance.
---
Creaye seperate character-&gt;Level to 50-&gt;THEN do all the quests.
---
I'm doing the same thing. Set up CAMP near the Overseer's (across the water, near the wooden tunnel bridge). I have all the crafting stations except tinkerer's bench and brewing station, a water pump, and several crops growing. Still looking for some corn and I'm missing a few plans.
---
The idea is for other players to stock up on stuff and rest in a bed with no risk of disease.
---
3 star legendary drop rates need to be tweeked for sure.. 80% at a minimum.  I did the queen fight last night, and I got a 2 star from the event reward and a one star from the queen.   
---
Did One Violent Night, and I got a 2 star level 35 boxing glove. The fuck bethesda? Not even max level?
---
As long as you equip butcher's bounty and harvest the blood, I won't be mad at you!
---
Welcome to the wasteland
---
It's locked to level 30, but can be crafted at level 50 if you get the Plan
---
Caps or items ?  If the latter can you give a brief ?
---
They just need to do it like the mystery quests, rebuild it using the previous version.
---
I'm on xbox and it works just fine, from GE
---
Yea. Having same issue on ps4
---
Seems to be linked to Adrenal Reaction and Class Freak, are you using both?
---
This, so much this. While server hopping I was trying to see if there is a pattern in the lights that show the event is available, but I didn't notice any change in the patterns.
---
So am I... My stash is full off legendary items I have outgrown
---
THIS! Noticed yesterday during ISS fight.... Didn't realize the ammo issue, though I did burn through about 12 plasma cores (which seemed excessive)
---
&gt; They mentioned it's geared towards end game players wanting to get their dream weapon, so just having a legendary roulette game where you pay tokens to gamble on a completely random item doesn't fit in with that
---
Yes it does, it fits in better with that than anything else. If they simply give you a badass weapon without crazy RNG involved then what keeps half the player base playing? Nothing. They're not going to shoot themselves in the foot, of course it's going to be loot roulette of some sort.
---
Besides I never said it's just a lottery system, my only implication so far has been we really don't know shit other than it's going to be destroying/trading unwanted legendaries for other legendaries. Be they good or bad trades, that's all we know and will know until either much closer to release or even until it's actually implemented.
---
I would love to be able to abandon a workshop.  Couple that with only allowing PvP for the workshop in the contested workshop zone, and I get to have a workshop, someone wants it, starts contesting it while I'm off doing something else far away on the map, and I can say, "yah, friend, go ahead and take it" and abandon the workshop and not interrupt my quest or fight or whatever.
---
Ill take both, what items do you have?
---
7) had no idea, somebody dropped it to me
---
8) Fuck
---
10) Died 1 time. Aid was gone
---
Every patch and bugfix and update in the last month or so has made the game less stable and less playable for me over-all...I'm getting about as many crashes now as I did at launch.
---
I was hoping they'd be wandering around in their own room upstairs to be people to go explore more.  Ah well.
---
Do you have high level turrets that require home defense 3 and took off the card?
---
Fingers crossed for my AAE Gatling plasma to be fully functional soon
---
lucky. on PC EU its so fucking hard to find a mic user
---
1) Do you have any photos?  
---
2) DMG Bug appears to be back, what weapon were you using?  
---
3) Can you screen grab? was clear when I visited.  
---
Have to do it if we want things fixed!
---
T'is a great idea my dude, but I believe in one of the vaults in the game there is a G.E.C.K. Vault 94 I believe and most likely it's what's caused the mire to form since from glitching in, we see a haywire G.E.C.K and plants seems to be escaping via the vault door.
---
That vault is set to be opened when the DLC drop Nuclear Winter is out, so maybe we may get a similar ending to what you suggested.
---
I would L-L-L-LOVE a viable crossbow
---
Yeah. Only the first tier of Class Freak though. When servers are up I will take it off and see if it corrects itself
---
Could you elaborate on the Infinite respawns?  
---
You or NPC's?&gt;
---
Yeah, and have it so all the robot defenders in Whitesprings can come to your camp and kill the dreaded molerat chomping on your foundation and  I 'm not sure, but I think indoor illumination is available in forms other than useless firearms.  Lol.  Just poking you a bit.
---
Not that I know of, I do know I had a buddy come in and put down a fusion reactor I don’t own. Is that something that would cause it to lock up?
---
once a quest is completed you can drop the related items, except keys
---
Just off the top of my head, you need a particular perk to make advanced turrets. Did you have turrets in you blueprint? You may have had the Perk active before, but replaced it since your previous build.
---
Confirmed and reported, serious issue.  
---
If you play on PC I can add it for you
---
Never heard of a company denying money, this is a first. Usually they accept all forms of currency even body organs, who needs their liver anyways amirite?
---
It wouldn't make much sense scaling for higher levels when you can hit maximum capability at level \~60.
---
I'm not sure that is true. I'm a shotgun build who never leaves power armor so, while leveling I scrapped every bit of armor that dropped for me. I have zero points in the armor perks. Ever since level 55, I could craft  all the Deep Pocketed Trapper Armor there is, all day long.
---
There’s a personal cool down as well I believe, but someone that hasn’t launched can launch if there’s a silo ready.
---
Can it’s legs be crippled and blown off? I do that to assaultrons in silos all the time and then finish them off as they crawl across the floor.
---
"I want to play on a server where I can shoot people on sight". "I want to make new friends". these do not go together.
---
Shhh, they'll "fix" it like they fix every positive change.
---
Yea I’ve heard of that happening to someone too, I did the same thing to a buddy of mine and he had it happen. He had to rebuild the base but was able to still put down the generator I gave him. No idea why it works like that!
---
Except there's no passive EXP gain for being alive compared to other 'survival games'.
---
If someone wants to sit around in their camp watching whatever, or doing whatever there's no real reason they shouldn't be able to. I mean sure they are using up a slot on the server but again, there's no gain from them being in their camp so no harm done to anyone else.
---
Yh the current way of managing perk cards isn’t really effective when the lead/lasers/plasma is flying
---
Commenting to note that I made the same purchase for the same reasons. Rather disappointed to see that it meant just the stairs, and didn't include the one that adds upper floors.
---
However, in my case, I can at least build them in my C.A.M.P.
---
Thanks man, I appreciate it
---
It's very good with a long list of qualifiers.
---
* Weapon durability is low. Better than it was before Patch 7, but you will not be successful carrying just one around. I carry 7, both to serve different roles, and to allow me to keep fighting in fights like the SBQ. Fighting the Sheepsquatch took a little over one gun's durability. The Queen takes every gun. You will have to farm Aluminum to keep up with repair costs.
---
* Shredders have very high DPS that, in my opinion, is just short of bloodied builds. There are plenty of enemies that can be one shot, but if a shredder can kill an enemy in less than a second and immediately move on to damaging the next without pause, that can be better in certain situations. I wager I can kill a Strikebreaker wave during the Sheepsquatch event faster than any melee and similar to an explosive build.
---
* The constant DPS is balanced by how easy you are to be interrupted. Enemies that knockback, like Yao Guai and Scorchbeasts, will interrupt your damage. You have to let off the trigger and spin up again to start doing damage. 
---
* Most perks don't benefit the shredder. None of the melee or heavy weapons perks have an effect in my experience. Heavy Gunner, Incisor, Martial Arts; the big ones. Shredding is technically bashing, and as such is the only weapon that you'd actually want the +40% bash damage on, or slot the Basher Perk. Generic damage increasers like Adrenaline, Bloody Mess and Tenderizer work nicely. Luck of the Draw could be great, but really procs too infrequently for how often you're hitting an enemy. Could be a bug. Gunsmith is required for lowering durability loss. 
---
* Most of the weapon prefixes seem to work as intended. Furious is the best, in my opinion, since you very quickly get hits in and build up the full damage bonus. Creature type-specific prefixes do well against those creatures, as you'd imagine. I have a ghoul-slaying, bashing gun specifically for farming Glowing Ones. Vampire and Executioners work well, but I can't say I've gotten the opportunity to let Executioners shine outside of the SBQ. I am on the fence on Anti-Armor. I carry two, along with two Furious, and I would almost always prefer using one of the Furious guns if available.
---
Alas.
---
I like trading with people on here more than randoms from Find a Group. Keeps everyone honest. Someone with 2+ years invested in reddit with large amounts of Karma is 95% of the time a quick deal AND probably good conversation. Haven't had a bad experience yet and I don't believe I've given one either. When trading weapons for now, I'll sell for the asking price and literally wait until you inspect it. If you decide against it as it wasnt what you thought or maybe i made a mistake, instant refund.
---
If you get a bad vibe from someone or they dodge answering questions, take it as a warning. Don't give or expect Credit. Someone can also screenshot it and share it to you withing a minute or so on xbox at least. I do it all the time as well.
---
That’s a very long list .......  I’ll try to compile it once I get a chance from my outdated one.  At work ( on lunch atm) so hopefully you’ll still have it.
---
Honestly, I get the whole "broken promise" thing, and I do see how some non-cosmetic items would effect pvp, but I'm having a really hard time thinking of anything they could sell that I couldn't just easily take a pass on if I wanted to. Fusion cores that never run out of juice? Nah, I'm good. Dog food manufacturing machine? Nice, but I'll just find it in the wild. And on and on. (And when everyone was throwing caps and real cash around on TSE's, I just didn't bother with it.) Again a real issue for pvp'ers? Potentially, but a lot of them already seem to think that the base mechanics are terrible, so I don't think that is the real future of this game.
---
Not arguing with you about it, just saying I'm not sure the slippery slope is a compelling argument unless they nerf things in relation to what they're selling in the store (e.g. increase weapon degradation a ridiculous amount, which, again, hasn't actually happened yet, at least as far as I can tell). I'm sure some think that the mention of fridges is somehow related to what seems like a greater decay rate in food items, but honestly, is anybody actually constantly starving now? Just grow some corn!
---
And okay, I thought of one thing that would be a must buy for me: Dogmeat or some other companion. They start selling those and I'm right there with you.
---
In the basements of one of the farm houses in the bog, I believe.  The floor's collapsed in, and the basement's flooded, and it's on a cork board on the wall.
---
They should have fixed it in the hotfix just now. This is going to cause a pretty big uproar IMO.
---
No, the whole point of my post is that we don't know shit. Todd howard almost literally repeated those two sentences with some extra verbiage added in.
---
It absolutely does give us information, we'll be destroying legendaries for new ones. The higher the star count on a legendary you get rid of will give you better odds at a good legendary. While that's not much, it absolutely is something and that something is important. It means that saving 3 star trash drops until the vendor releases is most likely worth your stash space. Probably even saving low weight two stars is and if you're not hurting for stash space you might as well save everything that's low weight until then.
---
Not that I know of but I will go around and check my cards. Do you think it might have to do with a friend of building items I don’t have? I know he came by and put in a fusion reactor for me, that’s a plan I don’t currently own.
---
If ai were Beth I would absolutely be putting fake files in the game to discredit data miners
---
Since the patch, I believe. Hope they get around to it soon.
---
I don’t think we have too much to worry about. The new questline ‘main event’ is clearly scaled properly, and I’ve never seen so many high level player deaths all at once. It’s glorious. If their other new content is in line with this event, we should be just fine. Btw, I think this new event is the most fun boss fight in the game so far (much more fun than just a bullet sponge SBQ). I can’t wait to see what’s next
---
I made a 4 story structure. The bottom is made out of plain wood and it juts a bit over the water so it kind of looks like a dock. Inside of that is my enclosed junk extractor and farm. It has double garage doors that open up to the water. I glitched all my industrial water purifiers to go on land and shoved them on the sides of the structure so the water view remains unobstructed. 
---
The basement layer is very large and is covered on top with the green AstroTurf. There is fencing all around it. You actually walk through the gate from a hill and on to the second floor to get to my camp. All my crafting benches are put outside around the perimeter. 
---
On this platform sits the smaller main structure. You open the door to the music room. Double stacked 2 x 1 stairs let you either go down to the basement farm or up to the third floor. You don't want to know what happens there. 
---
The top floor is a single 1 by 1 room on top of the whole thing. You actually get to it by marsupial jumping. In it is a single bed. 
---
The whole thing is Max budget. It takes up a lot of room but feels really small as there are separate distinct areas.
---
Maintenance now on fallout, hopefully it’s being fixed!
---
Games are cheap, usually less than $60.  However within a decade the cost to develop games went from under a million to anywhere between 50-150 million.
---
It is just the industry, for companies to make more and better games, they need the money flow, as nobody really cares about your fantasies or unusual desire to make marriage commitments to games, it is still a business.
---
Now that no one pre-orders anything, it’s even harder.  Steam is also a cancer, a platform that advertises early access products but takes no responsibility for them.  On top of their history of loot boxes and gambling, most issues with todays video game industry can be stemmed back to Steam and its malicious practices.
---
So yeah, that extra 100 mil has to come from somewhere, and it tends to be in cash shops or season passes this cycle.
---
Dang hope not!!! I put my soul into that building 😭. Thank you for the follow up though I really appreciate it. :)
---
I like mine. Works very well on super mutants, but also everything -- depending on your perks.
---
Can't say I'm familiar with that mod, I'm only level 70 and still using excavator gear haha. I would look it up but I love finding out this stuff on my own :D
---
Lol nice
---
 I made it doesn't take being an English teacher to to see that the paragraph is hard to read.
---
kisith
---
As long as you join the same world. There's always a risk doing it this way, but I haven't lost anything yet doing so.
---
straight to desktop, 5 minutes in the game. came back, started a silo, got the prep to 75% and straight to desktop, Killed the shielded assaultron and before it showed completed event... straight to desktop , came back received no loot from the event. Nothing new here, working as intended.
---
Lol where have you been everything you said is wrong people will outrage if Bethesda breaths the wrong way hey get almost nothing but criticism where have you been??
---
I can hold it until you have the ability to make a list
---
Lucky us then, this seems to only happen to you.
---
I really want the talking animal syringer... that's my favorite quest.
---
Sometimes the names have a [story](https://youtu.be/gyD5ySlYkjU?t=47) tho.
---
Yea don’t feel bad man, I’ve had to rebuild my base 10+ times due to the glitch of having pics on my walls and “items is floating”. I move a lot so I’m always having to rebuild! Best of luck to you and hopefully they fix stuff like that!
---
Wow thanks for the info, all great stuff to know!
---
Impossible. We create NEW buildings with broken windows lol. We can never have a greenhouse!
---
There's only one real way to find out! 
---
I swear by the lever action rifle. Solid damage output and a nice looking gun. I would recommend a suppressor &amp; a decent receiver. Just have a go and see what you think!
---
ive got one if you need another on pc :)
---
When ever something gets delayed I think of [Shigeru Miyamoto](https://images.app.goo.gl/ynKbXzTecMrBCysd8)
---
Ah ok I’ll give it a go, if it fails it’s not the biggest loss in the world
---
That was my thought. Granted, I've only done the event once, last night, and was a conduit, so I wouldn't know how it sounds normally.
---
On PC you need to rejoin the same server and can only do this if you have friends on it.  I’ve done the container method so I don’t have to trouble anyone but have lost stuffs too.  Say a friend leaves the server at the same time or more recently the whole server craps and dumps everyone.  Had that happen to me twice this week while mid transfer - it’s usually not this problematic though.
---
Well the main road map does confirm we're getting quite a bit.
---
I tried to build around the idea of doing nuke zones without PA/Hazmat.
---
I used a full set of Trapper Armour with bonuses to Rad Resist. Add on top of it full Rad resistant perk, radshield, diluted rad ex, level 3 Radsponge that I shared with my team, and Ghoulish to heal after the radsponge triggered on me.
---
Was only able to last a few minutes before the rads caught up with me
---
That note has always been there
---
For pve it should would but I might suggest not using crafting or situational perks at all time but instead switch them out when you go to need it. Definitely add concentrated fire to perception so you can get off better shots. And if you plan to use mutations make sure to put starched genes at 2 stars.
---
Good thing I got Aquaboy/girl. Pretty much all water sections will be a breeze with that.
---
My two guns are a Quad faster fire rate tsla and a Quad explosive tesla. Named mike pence and mice pence with fireworks. Respectively
---
I want to know this is a serious question, i saw they said "people were requesting something like this a lot"? Have ANY of you guys ever seen people request for repairing their game to be monetized ? I find it extremely hard to believe people were screaming from the top of the mountain, charge me to repair my gear...please. 
---
It's such a same too, because i recently came back to the game with the start of wild appalachia and that was a decent patch with the brewing and this most recent one is great so far. I don't get why they would jeopardize such a great time to get people back to the game or interested in it because it's improving with something as dumb as this. Especially with all the criticisms the game has faced since before and after launch.
---
hazmat suit ftw
---
She takes 30% damage from all sources
---
Honestly, I didn't know friends could modify your Camp. I'll leave this to the experts, then.
---
Be careful using containers.  When you spawn back into a cell, it can reset them.  I lost a whole lot of serums yesterday doing this.
---
What an excellent original idea, my friend! Wonder why no one ever thought of this, it's brilliant!
---
&gt;Well I didn’t see that in future fallouts-  
---
&gt;Well maybe it’s just such a bad mutation that they died out
---
Until it resurfaces in a game down the road that takes places after Fallout 4.
---
Hope we get an increase to the size of the photo gallery one day. I maxed it out a long time ago and don’t want to delete anything because I love the pictures as loading screens.
---
3k?
---
Oh, my bad. I didn't know you actually expected me to be upset.
---
Saw someone make a mod of some form for the PC version of the game. That mod alone is the main reason why I am sad that I have F76 for the PS4. Lol
---
I sincerely hope so!
---
yes it is and i even made a post about this exact thing
---
They're pathetic at their job
---
i read your comments and seen that it is most likely the fusion generator. If you are on the PS4 i wouldnt mind helping you rebuild your camp.
---
inb4 crop recipes in the Atomic shop.
---
&gt;Yes it does, it fits in better with that than anything else. If they simply give you a badass weapon without crazy RNG involved then what keeps half the player base playing? Nothing. They're not going to shoot themselves in the foot, of course it's going to be loot roulette of some sort.
---
Have you not considered the possibility of limited RNG? Pay tokens to randomly reroll one star on a 3 star weapon? Hell even paying tokens to reroll all effects on a 3* legendary while keeping the base item intact? I'd strongly argue that fits in much better with that idea than 100% RNG. There's a lot of room in between handing players their dream godroll and 100% RNG.
---
“A delayed [feature] is eventually made good.” ~ Shigeru Miyamoto
---
i tough starched genes was in 2\*, and its just for pve
---
To be honest the game needs a battle royal mode or team deathmatch to get the hardcore pvpers a spot just for PvP so it tones down a bit in survival.
---
I don't mind occasional gunfights but survival was a bit too much in its first implementation.
---
My guess is that they will release it later, right before the summer update, in May.
---
She takes 30% damage from all sources. I edited the original post with proof.
---
Hmm they had moved that speaker off of characters and onto the left side of the screen. At least on PS4 anyway
---
Unluckily for you, a lot of the quest reward weapons will not scale to your level.
---
Thus has been a problem since FO4; they've never worked correctly. It's easy enough to run wires, then places walls or use the rug/sign tricks. 
---
Conduits make lovely decorations though if you are going for a steam-punk industrial look motif.
---
&gt; I was more annoyed with the amount of shotgun ammo a spent
---
Try being a heavy weapons build lol. Shotgun ammo is plentiful and easy to make en masse.
---
Gotcha, just noticed that and thought I'd point it out
---
modified it already
---
She takes 30% damage from all sources. I edited the original post with proof. She does not have any health scaling
---
the question is, do we share it with those that laughed at us for putting some points in END?
---
Possibly. Either one would had solved the issue. More vendors at whitesprings was the cooler solution if implemented correctly while the other was a fail safe.
---
You only need the board and the flux if you want to do the quest a second time.  You were given one of the devices so you can do the battle once, but you have to craft one if you want to do it again.
---
The "Super Rare Material" is stable fluorescent flux.  The most handy way to get one is to go to the whitespring during or after a nuke event and pick 10 raydadendrons (located in front of the houses near the cars). This gets you 10 raw fluorescent flux.  Then collect one hardened mass, one glowing mass and one high radiation fluids from bodies of glowing ghouls.  Bring that all in to the whitespring and craft one stable flourescent flux at a chem bench.  Then put it in your stash so you don't lose it if you die.
---
My armor-piercing, 40% faster swing speed Deathclaw Gauntlet is called “Butt Scratcher”. I am not a creative man.
---
Why didn't they at least give us a small chance at learning mods for them? What's more work... 
---
 A few hundred caps to buy the plans for most of the mods from the brotherhood... Or scrapping fairly hard to come by PA pieces? Both seem like the same amount of work. Expensive mod plans like the jetpacks could be taken out of the loot table made incredibly rare. 
---
Would this gain traction as a suggestion?
---
Alright thank you!
---
Rule of thumb, it's always good until you find a replacement. I always carry 1 or 2 weapons of multiple ammo types for combat. Single shot for stragglers and auto for hords. Lever action is pretty high damage for .45. I recently found a lvl 50 two shot and with perks and hardened reciever it does about 138 dmg per shot.
---
But again it won’t make them the money in the short term that can boost their next earnings calls numbers etc.  Its definitely not about the long term, they just care about immediate shareholder impressions
---
It's meant to penetrate energy resistances NOT the ballistic resistance.
---
I ran my troubleshooter exploding cryolator and it was fantastic!
---
What level?
---
Ah sorry, I didn't see it
---
I have tried a number of things, the only noticable factor which actually does anything was Grass LoD. This reduced the issue but did not eliminate it.
---
Yeah, I'm having the same problem. Also, I can't build a different light for a power armor helmet when I have the material.
---
Iv been doing it with an ice chest and no issues yet but it’s always pretty risky. Especially because I use someone from my friends list without telling them what I’m doing. If they server hop it’s all over.
---
Can't you buy the piece needed at every vendor regardless of Whitesprings?
---
The workshops sihould at least be defensible.   As is, missile turrets are easy to hide from and frankly are just not effective.  If the guy taking the workshop can one- shot kill, then the turrets should too.  And non one should be able to avoid them by crouching behind a wall.  A missile turret should be able to blast straight through the wall and kill him. These are missiles, not 38 caliber bullets.
---
Most likely? Nothing.
---
I've gotten all my lvl50 T-60 pieces from Big Bend Tunnel, if you feel like giving it a look.
---
What is end game loot? Fallout 76 is not a mmo I don’t think the game works that way on that level you want 3 or 4 star stuff to do what? Grind the same mission with hose same items but do it faster? I don’t think fallout 76 is about end game its about the journey game it’s not WoW and not trying to be and I’m glad it’s not
---
Or snipe folks with stimpax while being mobile
---
Its not even that. I really enjoy the game, and honestly repair kits are probably something that I would actually spend money on.
---
What I am mainly worried about is the fact that repair kits were very clearly something the community is concerned about. There was a very pronounced reaction and Bethesda hasn't even taken the time to acknowledge that reaction. They are categorically ignoring the community on this issue and that just isn't a good look regardless of the context.
---
I want both the game and the community to be the best that they can be, and this situation shows that quality of Bethesda's community interaction still leaves something to be desired in a very critical way. At the very least, they could have at least acknowledged the reaction, they wouldn't even have had to give a statement of substance, but they didn't even do that.
---
Someone else said it in another thread but whitesprings looks like a robot flea market now. They just stand in the weirdest spots.
---
Thank you.  After advancing the quest I gained access.
---
Mine glitched out to where I could only activate the fermenter while crouching in front of it. While crouching I could finally read the note and then activate that last part to complete the quest.
---
Agreed. I'm not damning them, IMO it's the only choice they have left. Thanks for engaging in discussion, instead of just hitting the blue arrow.
---
And that's fine, because it means I know where consumers stand with them and they will be on my "not at launch ever again" list along with bioware(that may just be a never buy from again period situation) and bungie. I'm sure they don't ultimately care, but hopefully there's lots of folks that feel this way, which may lead to more consumer friendly policy in the future.
---
Candy area would not be used because of the terminal in the room off the side. I guess pathing wise u won't be able to go. Especiall since the cash register is right behind the door. 
---
But I totally agree that they shud be behind counters and not randomly in the room. I believe there is an extra counter with register in the food shop *Le Grand Gourmet) (with Antoine and Marie)
---
Helena (in the aurum) has TWO extra cash registers on counters that can be used. I don't see why the shopping mall vendor is floating like a sales rep
---
The responder vendor needs to move a smidge to right and behind the counter.
---
The raider needs to be moved back a few so he is behind the counter
---
I can’t but maybe I’m just special
---
What's the deal with the repair kits!? :)
---
It's the opposite, actually. Japan has incredibly strict regulations on microtransactions; that's almost certainly why Bethesda isn't doing it.  Microtransactions in Japan, for instance, have to expire. Konami did that on MGS and got ripped apart for it -- mostly by Americans who didn't understand why in the first place.
---
&gt;Armor or item sets. Most of the MMORPGs have these kind of items, and I think these greatly extends the game lifetime. Everybody wants an own armorset which is not craftable by anybody, but you can collect from BOSS or world drop. New skins from the Atomic Shop is nice, but (for example) if the Raider Excavator armour were a farmable armour set with specific ability, everybody would collect it. But now it's just a skin what makes your "already have" gear to look different... nothing special, nothing exciting.
---
i would kill for a dungeon or raid that you could farm and it would drop power armor pieces for the dungeon/raid power armor set like item sets in wow
---
Absolutely! I haven't even played the new content and I already know how it goes and how it ends and how to beat it just from reading titles on the sub
---
ほんまに英語がうまいだよ。

Maintenance finished and it hasn't been fixed.

Small suggestions:

Yes, actually he does.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/46bcq5/konami\_sets\_expiration\_date\_on\_microtransactions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/46bcq5/konami_sets_expiration_date_on_microtransactions/)   
---
You are the weakest link, good bye.
---
Finally I can play as medic in something other the TF2.
---
Wow, that sucks!
---
I don't disagree about spending the money on games, but i only do it with games i feel deserve the support at the time. Warframe is an example for me and basically my only one i've ever bought microtransactions in. It's not because i feel forced or even need to to get what i want. I do it to support the devs because they have given more tons of hours of entertainment for free. In my opinion Fallout 76 which i've enjoyed for the most part and even more so recently , but i want to see why this game even had to exist in it's current form besides being a microtransactions generator. I feel and just know this is my opinion, they say they would get massive push back for having paid mods in their single player games so they made this game and have used a ton of assets from fallout 4 even to sell back to us . Just rubs me the wrong way a bit.
---
I want nothing more than to have a fallout game that will basically be updated with new content for years to come as im a huge fallout fan , but right now it just feels off to me. This most recent update though is making me feel different though , so hopefully they can keep it up.
---
I guess all vendors have it. I saw many outside of WS listed for sale in inventory.
---
Yes I have considered that, but it certainly didn't sound like you did. It's what I assume it will be. But that's not what you were talking about. I'm the one who was talking about it being RNG and that includes limited RNG.
---
I agree there will most likely be a couple different things you can spend legendaries on, but who knows. They might just give him a weekly list of loot and the more stars you feed him the better the loot you get out of that list. They might allow you to choose roll for a pure RNG thing, like if you give him a 1 star, you can choose the base item for what you'll get back and everything else is RNG. If you give him a 3 star, you can choose the base item, the primary affix and be guaranteed at least a 2 star back. Who fucking knows, all I'm saying is that we **know** it will be rng based. We **know** feeding him higher * loot will have better results. Speculating on anything else is just that. Speculating.
---
I’ve seen where if you drop the mod in a bag and pick it back up it’ll fix it?
---
It's great! I have an anti-armor explosive one that one shots deathclaws and most mobs ingame. Mod it out and have fun
---
4K for the set and one outfit?
---
imp set: 5k
---
There isn't any use in running hard bargain 3 at all times so I would suggest either lone wanderer 2 or tenderizer.
---
It was for server stability?
---
Just find someone trusty worthy. I’ve paid people to hold stuff for me. You can find clans and guilds online that will help.
---
Look, we get that you're poor, it's OK.
---
No. You can do the entire quest alone. You get some new plans and awards along the way and it’s a fun read. 
---
But at the end, you finish the quest. 
---
After that, you have the option to do the event. 
---
The event has more plans and apparel, and yes, it needs to be done with a group. 
---
But I highly recommend doing the quest. I loved it.
---
Update to improve server stability, no gameplay changes so no patch notes
---
Yeah no dude, when someone calls someone else a "cuck" it makes everything else they say sound like it's coming out of the mouth of a barely pubescent highschool kid.
---
That's pretty much how I got it done. Had to remove a wall panel then install thru wall conduit. Replace wall. There's several build items that only work if you remove a wall then place the item you want. Support poles are one. Tried putting a roof on them and couldn't. So I put walls up then roof. Removed one wall and put supports in. Then same with next wall panel.
---
Is not a term, it's a legendary effect weapons have. Gives more damage output the lower the users health.
---
I’ll go 6k for both combined.
---
That would be interesting. I wouldn't mind and frankly I don't even mind stuff like repair kits. It's the radio silence that annoys me.
---
Lower health=higher damage on a bloodied weapon
---
Survival is awesome/terrible all at once.  The PvE enemies seem tougher, which I find enjoyable and legendary enemies are a little more numerous (maybe I've just been lucky).  On the flipside, you have to be extremely careful when walking into "civilized" areas like train stations, towns, etc.  More often than not there's some bored bastard with a chameleon armor piece just waiting to pop your head off.  I spend most of my time in third person zoomed all the way out to catch the glimmer of the stealthed/bloodied power fist clown that sneaks up from behind to give me the bad touch.
---
My friends and I have a decent sized, English speaking discord group, but I'm not in charge of it and don't feel comfortable sending out invitations willy nilly.  We're mostly high level end-gamers between the ages of 30-50.  I don't know if that's an interesting crowd for you.  Gay/bi/trans friendliness is a must, but we mostly share high level perk loadouts, [bespoke item trades](https://imgur.com/0qijS48) and [ridiculous photos](https://imgur.com/ZKwrbsP).
---
It confirms the new game mode, the vault raids, and "new features". It's these "new features that interest me the most and I hope are expanded upon soon.
---
Will but a sheepsquatch outfit, 1k
---
Been crashing more since Tuesday's patch on PS4, pretty much getting disconnected or the game would just stop during loading.
---
What else would Mothman eat?
---
Just tried, didnt work for me.
---
I think its a "you better buy this now or you wont be able to again" or "if you buy this now you will be one of the lucky few who has it" type of thing.
---
I wish the recon marks stayed after weapon swap.
---
Historically in past games  I used to play medic and DPS
---
The ingame stims solution has me running to folks who are down. I waste time running to injured folks, stim and THEN run to my next casualty 
---
Give me the ability to be mobile and remote stim others without having to run find stim and run again 
---
The other stuff would be cool too 
---
This game aspires to get introverts to be more communicative and involved.
---
This would help move the responder and possibly even the order agenda being more effective and transparent
---
i think they shouldn't just ignore the massive outcry from their customers, at least let us know you heard us and you are working on it, or SOMETHING
---
When it’s that time of month, a very dangerous time.
---
It’s silly the lack of understanding towards this, Bethesda is not a charity they don’t make games solely to give to us out of the goodness of their hearts they are a business they have investors they have stock market options if they’re not profitable then how will they justify keeping this game going with new stuff “fixes” I use that term very loosely glad to see that not everyone is a robot on here, now granted I think we may be the majority but smart enough to just be content with what’s going on and not open our mouths
---
Broke the Atom shop??? Bet that’ll get fixed sharpish.
---
Awesome, thank you! Opposite of Instigating then I guess.
---
It is super weird to see a heavy-set quirky nerd judging other people. The whole situation is disturbing, frankly, but I guess it shows that we really don't know people's inner thoughts much of the time. &gt;.&lt;
---
Nope. Let's [dab on those fools.] (https://i.ytimg.com/vi/_3bUzSy--cQ/hqdefault.jpg)
---
That’s my point exactly
---
If you’re a responder THIS is where you’d shine
---
Think of all the perks you wouldn’t have to respec for!!!
---
Shit I wanna see that now

---
Damn just like life.. turns out to be nothing exciting
---
This slows down DRAMATICALLY , i don't know how much you have played. I thought the same thing until i earned a signicant portion of the ones the game launches with , then you basically rely on the daily and weekly ones which isn't that much , maybe enough to earn one or two items in the shop.
---
I have been doing that. Just have had really bad luck.
---
It dropped a 1* buzz saw for me. It's the best legendary I've found so far. All legendary drops are crap.
---
I’m sure there a good amount but still I believe we’re in the vocal minority here.  I just don’t think they’ll be changing any time soon unless legislation gets passed that hits them for micros and predatory marketing etc
---
When you fell out of the game world didnt it teleport you up to the ground level?
---
You can run it outside. Required removing wall and installing thru wall conduit backwards. You have to put a deck floor on the outside to support conduit. I think you can remove the deck after conduit is hooked up.
---
Ever play a free to play game? They always give you loads and loads of crystals/gold/magic orbs/whatever the premium currency is in the start then cut it off later once people have a sunk cost.   
---
They also have the grind to keep things repaired at a medium level now, but are squeezing it with nerfing of perks like white knight and will add harder and harder to repair items in the future (look at the curve of materials needed from 20 to 30 to 40 to 50, look where it'll be at 60 when they add that) and realize they are putting repair kits on sale for money. This is all well worn techniques from bad mobile games and people are gonna fall for it and are gonna defend it too.
---
Buttons should be flopped. 
---
"A" should be used to confirm "yes scrap item"
---
"B" should be to cancel the action since B normally exits screens.
---
Honestly sounds like you should focus on your life then and actually step down. A PhD and your professional life is way more important than being a mod on Reddit for a video game. You shouldn’t be getting called out directly but there is a big need for mods to organize the chaos of this sub’s problem with spoilers.
---
nooooooot really my style, tough adrenaline would be nice to have
---
nope i jsut died that time, other times i have fallen through floors i magically appear either on the floor below or back on the ground, so this was a bad way to die... plus my bag was gone forever!
---
Ah no good man. I'm getting blue screened!
---
I have a travellers leather coat or tattered field jacket I could trade of it if you like.
---
 That will literally kill the game it will be the nail in the coffin for a lot of people in my opinion. The repair kits are bad enough and now we have a dedicate pvp server that kind of system would be even worse than on the regular servers.
---
i hate having to switch cards for everything
---
0.001% for YOU to get good loot, your percentage will be 80% to get a piece of wood 1 star with the mad being "Bethesda hates you" 
---
10% chance for 2 star raider armor level 35
---
9% chance of a western revolver 2-3 star
---
Less than 1% to be 3 star good armor or weapon.
---
200% chance for it to be nerfed in a month after you get it.
---
I used a Vampire combat shotgun and did pretty ok. I don't really have a use for the Tesla Rifle, I think I'm just going to save it for the Legendary Merchant.
---
If someone just wants to sit in their camp, what are a couple of other plants going to do for them then?
---
The point of not having everything accessible in your CAMP is to create an incentive to play the game. You can do whatever you want in the game sure, but there needs to be a general structure for what the "normal" gameplay loop is. In this the basic loop is: explore, kill, loot, build. And there needs to be incentive and rewards for doing what the game is generally designed for.
---
Also, I think they wanted people to socialize more and depend on each other for resources more often and adding more and more renewable resources to your camp kind of lower the incentive to go out and do things that lead to that.
---
I get 3 stars fairly regularly out in the world, about 1-2 a week. Very few have even been useful. When it isn't a revolutionary sword or wood armor piece, its just a terrible roll. Or maybe you just don't get 3 good effects, just 1 or 2. 
---
I, like a lot of people would spend a lot of time farming boss's for guaranteed 3 stars... if there was an efficient way to do it. Right now what you have to go through to take down SBQ or the imposter is not worth a single roll on a 3 star.
---
Kinda, instigating just doubles the damage output, if the target is at full health. I guess executioners is the closest to opposite, does more damage the lower the targets health, and not your own.
---
Being able to make your own skill presets would be a huge time saver
---
Still doesn’t make a ton of sense. What’s her armor? Maybe that scales? Say she has 300 armor, and that comes after damage has been reduced by her perk. I’ve got Stabilized, so she has ~ 165 armor. After Adrenaline (I’m going to average it at 50% bonus damage since I don’t have perfect uptime, but it’s up a lot), my baseline damage is 450. 30% of that is 135. 165 armor vs 135 damage means I’m doing... well, I’m estimating, but maybe 40% damage? So 54 damage a bullet. That’s ~600 bullets. Multiply that by 50% for her half-health regen, that’s 900 bullets. 
---
So you’re saying I should be able to kill the queen, by myself, with 4 reloads?
---
Never had that happen so far - I use open ones in more open areas, won't try this at Whitesprings or anywhere else too busy.  You'll have to forgive me for not wanting to share the exact locations of the containers I use.
---
This is actually a really cool idea.
---
I dig it!
---
Still trying to find the event... but any tips to find a starting point to it? Usually events start around players but is this different?
---
It should be like the Fallout 4 stuff you can buy. @Todd get on it.
---
Dang I was thinking that may be the issue 😭 I’m on xbox . Wish there was crossplay!!! Thanks for offering dude :)
---
What's end game loot to you?
---
Turn of the game and turn it back on
---
I do too, but he’s talking about consistent crashes, especially in high-impact circumstances.
---
All that to purchase a fake currency that 100% should not exist...
---
I'm having the same issue. When attempting to apply the mod to my power armor I receive the message that previous mods will be removed. When selecting to continue the mod isn't applied.  Hopefully a fix will be applied in their next update.
---
Oh okay XD, and huh didn't think a combat shotty had a good enough rate of fire for it to keep the health up, I've been looking for a vampires minigun since that thing just insta-heals!
---
Where is the plan from?
---
Thanks JK Rowling
---
I kind of recall the armor giving the +100 as a design perk. Losing the carry capacity is an old power armor bug, it might have come back
---
The other thing that heavy weapons means power armor. VATS in Power armor means massive core drain.
---
22 days ago, and they still haven't fixed it? wtf Beth.
---
Yes had two today before the mantinence so with luck that will fix it.
---
Sure add me psn: Welcometothefunk
---
Honestly I think a better solution would be to have the camera go into a third person arial view when placing the C.A.M.P so we can see exactly where all the boundaries are, and then be able to nudge it left or right slightly once it’s placed but before we build anything. 
---
While you can sort of get an idea by going into third and moving the camera as far back as possible, topography and flora don’t always let you see all the boundaries exact locations.
---
No i didn't mean legally , i meant like as consumers . I always heard gamers in the west are usually more likely to spend money on in game purchases as it was more common over there due to a lot of mobile game players.
---
That's one of my favorite places, probably because there was a chance that I could have been stationed there.
---
Yes for sure, here is the best way, but not everyone uses this channel, still have facebook groups and the LFG on Xbox (not sure if have some similar on PS4 or PC).
---
Also this "fix" apply to the bot vendors as it dont show all effects too.
---
The sheepsquatch dropped the most badass weapon for. Looked for one for 700 hrs and finally got it off of its drop. A legendary no started lvl 20 drill. Lucky me! Lmao
---
Ive had this happen to me a handful of time in various areas. I think it has something to do with the terrain that you were in when you fell through. 
---
I have had success in re-aquiring my dropped items, though it sounds like the area you were was probably build restricted. So all of my methods do not work.
---
Farm fort defiant
---
On now?
---
I just did!
---
yeah, all my feedback has to do with the realization of a multiplayer identity. containers are a thing we need to be a finished feature. multiple players can interact with a container, but it's a test app. it's not finished with any multiplayer containers yet. it needs to be, among a whole variety of similar threads to finish the game and take it beyond test apps to a finished game with multiplayer features.
---
The end result is that all the features work together, allowing playful creators and creative players to have sustained upward feedback loop of their choices impacting each other, stuff like the deathclaw maze guy and the project to close all the fissures at once to happen as a natural gameplay world progression, not something happening just because we as the biggest fans of fallout are making it happen in the community. The game mechanics themselves should come to a point that the gameplay happens like this and we can impact the world and each other in a way that's inherent to Play. We are currently making it happen by the natural freedom mechanic that humans use - the coming together of our wills into unity, into a voluntary interaction because we all want to be here. 
---
I love this community. Fallout is the game that made me into this anarchist, sex positive, mortality cognizant human being. It gave me these things in my formative years when fallout 1 landed and I was 14 playing junktown on the PC gamer demo disk, just one little city offering hours and hours of things to discover and paths to try out. Extremely few games have measured up to just that standard for me, my favorites list is small in the 23 years since then.
---
Fort Defiance
---
If the new event is anything to go by it means we'll all go stomping in there like billy big balls and get our asses kicked. It'll be like the movie Aliens. Can't wait.
---
your damage gets reduced BEFORE armor is applied
---
If A was to scrap item then spamming A like people do when scrapping loads of weapons would still scrap the favorite, this forces you to stop and manually change buttons to scrap it
---
Yeah and I realized I can recreate a real photo I have framed
---
Good to know at least my mutant slayers explosive cryo will have a use.
---
Yeah I really thought they would do this! Would be such a cool picture
---
Thanks for this tip mate I got it today just before the mantinance :)
---
Screenshot the other players on the server. Stash your stuff in an out of the way location and use the find players option on xbox to rejoin.
---
Where did you find the time travel portal?
---
Ash heap area, just North of the train station.  Its time-triggered.
---
Would be cool to have a repeatable quest that gives you syringer mods for each quest and after doing them all you get a unique syringer
---
maybe this link of affected games will help  https://www.playstation.com/en-us/network/onlineid/games-list-home/issues-identified/
---
max
---
I thought it was her damage resistance that scales, not her health. And her DR is a flat reduction, which is why it is so potent.
---
I’m pretty sure they were drops before just super rare, people are just speculating if they drop more often now, or tweaked how often high level boss fights/events drop them now. Could be a bug as many popped up from the recent patch
---
Uh spoilers dude! Please tag this as such!
---
Instigating is about the target's health. Bloodied is about the attacker's health.   
---
Instigating is a closer "opposite" to executioner, though even that's a stretch.
---
I don't know if it's true, but I've read that with shotguns because they have 9 bullets each shot, they all count. I make sure I'm right up in whatever's face, though, so I'm not missing any shots lol.
---
私は日本の放射性降下物について何も知らない
---
I think you can craft the card though.
---
My stealth guy uses rifles vs shotguns
---
My logic is rifles deliver large pain in small
---
Amounts over long distance vs shotguns which deliver large pain over moderate to short distance 
---
Check your working range on your shotguns
---
FWIW, my melee is now ranged stealth AR.
---
I’ll tank 2nd but the goal is tag and bag over large distance
---
I could only get the through wall conduit to go through one way.
---
I’d settle for a “foundation” that was a garden plot.
---
Or more flat land in general.
---
Or certain areas where you can better flatten land with placements.
---
Also: not related, but they should add big limited  events in later that let us build progress across servers to “fix” parts of towns.    I mean, we’re killing the scorched queens, stopping the virus. Now we can start to rebuild no?
---
Wondered how long this thread would take to get around to "My wood is Legendary"  jokes.
---
I can understand that. I just know when I see a screen like that pop up I go "oh shit" and smash the "B" button.
---
i went to the hopewell cave and found a 2 star legendary ghoul and lured it over to the fissure site thats near the cave and killed it and completed the challenge
---
Boom! I have the same one!!
---
It's at a time like this I'm glad I play on ps4.
---
What platform?
---
Yes, this happened to me as well.
---
Oh, I see what you mean. I'm not sure there's any real difference. Yes, it "feels" more culturally accepted there, because in most of the rest of the world there's no stigma against mobile gaming the way that U.S. and Western European "gamers" have about spending more than the absolute bare minimum possible on a game.  But the "core gamer" culture in the West, doesn't actually represent your typical American mobile game player. The average mobile player spends on microtransactions in the U.S. as well, they just spend somewhat less than a Japanese mobile player will.  Then again, Japan doesn't have a cultural problem of game-bros shouting at mobile gamers about "filthy casuals" and "P2W".
---
This is also a great idea, maybe they could implement both. But a lot of the time I need to move the circle, knowing exactly where the circle ends behind me would prevent a lot of it lol so top view might be better indeed.
---
Seems the conduit is made for indoor use. If you go outside with it when you get to the corner your conduit stick's out a foot from the side wall. I went with wire connectors because of this. I have a one foundation floating house with about 6 connectors on the bottom. This allows me to quickly power up collector's when I move.  Which has been often lately. Almost have that build 76 camps complete. And I like to locate in an area I'm working in to save caps on FT.
---
But it's just as bad on console so it does need to be changed. I play on XB1 and yeah, sometimes it just refuses to grab/place wires and will just jump when I'm in range and aiming at a conduit thing.
---
I'm sorry, you asked this in the wrong subreddit 😂
---
I know exactly where you're talking about my buddy has his camp right next to it. overlooking those pink trees in the bog, no?
---
You are completely missing the point of OP's request. Some people don't want to hold or contest the workshop, they simply want to use it temporarily as a fast travel point or to complete a daily/weekly challenge like this week's "Claim Thunder Mtn Power Plant" challenge.
---
Instead of being forced to server hop or deal with the easily abused PvP system people should have an option to "unclaim" it once they're finished or a way to relinquish control of the workshop to whoever contests it.
---
PC? If so, get rid of your mods and/or custom ini file.
---
Yep whenever is best for you
---
huh ..sounds like we did the same thing but only one of us got it completed, anyways I'll head right on over to see if I can't find a ghoul there myself, perhaps the fissure I chose is bugged (mine was the one down by Mac's Farm). Thanks for the reply (Y)
---
It doesnt auto scrap when you hit B though, it just brings up the menu you *would* have gotten anyway telling you how many resources you'll get, so unless your spamming A, panic, hit B, then immediatly go back to mashing A again it wont happen
---
I want a 10 star rolling pin or 30 star wooden armor set can't wait :)
---
Ohhh god yeah, that also counts for critical and explosive shots completely forgot about that!
---
Thanks for this. Although I earn Atoms the hard way, which would make it a bigger blow.
---
*EDIT*
---
Only 3 sheepsquatch outfits left, imposter outfit was sold
---
No clue. I finally tried them out last night and tested to see if something worked.
---
Fair point, although in order to melt someone it has to be a strong laser. Primes laser is a example
---
Im hoping since Zenimax Online figured out a way to basically have infinite storage for crafting materials maybe they could help bethesda do some stuff with their systems as well. Wishful thinking i know, but i don't see why it couldnt happen. I think ESO is the only MMO i've ever played that basically had infinite storage from materials it is of course only with the subscription fee though which is reasonable for what kind of game it is.
---
Thank you, that is a source. Without it it's just you saying, "Source: Me"
---
Hmmm I have a quad cryolator and a furious cryolator, I might need to try them out later for that fight.
---
Wouldn’t let me click the fermenter, but I could read the note on it. I also lost access to the locked room that tells you what the secret ingredient is so I’m kinda screwed. Biv does make remarks that it’s in there though
---
Me too. Defeats the whole purpose of the recon mark.
---
Xbox One
---
Where did I say anything about being rich? You seemed to have completely missed ghe point I was making. I was pointing out that even people who are completely financially secure and have disposable income aren't okay with being lied to.
---
Update 
---
To the kind souls who awarded me gold thank you 
---
I seriously was just trying to see how we could make better use of syringer while helping others out
---
Again my sincerest thanks
---
I love your idea.  It would have made more sense to me if they dropped it on 4/1 though. :)
---
Fasnacht is still going on? I though it ended...
---
I was going to experiment with this the next time I did the event.  Great to know it actually works.
---
THANK YOU!!
---
Hopefully they implement something like this. Would be a really cool addition to making your camp more personal.
---
Thank you for your reply, I did what you suggested. I submitted a ticket and explained in detail how this problem come about and it was a quest item that is required to complete a quest line. Hopefully they will at least try and patch it so no one else runs into this.  I wish they could return the item or reset the quest for me but I do not believe they will :( Anyway thank you for the suggestion!
---
there is no scaling at all. everything just does 30% damage to her before adding her armor into effect
---
Then why does leather have a higher energy resist than metal?
---
I have lag and stuttering on the best of days.  At its worst its unplayable.
---
*SPOILER*
---
One of the side quests from the new update has you track a Yao Gui named Fluffy.
---
I launched on her 3 times yesterday and the whole server showed up to kill her ranging from level 25-239.
---
Killed her all 3 times with time to spare.
---
Sucks that your experience hasn't been great but mileage does vary.
---
Where is your camp, friend? I’d love to see this for myself.
---
Ohhhh I misread that about 'users health' and assumed it was the victims health lol
---
Thank you all.
---
not having those issues, but i've been kicked to desktop on the PC 5 times in a hour. Not too happy about that either.
---
I actually liked what they did with the Atom Shop at launch, back before it started becoming more like the Creation Club. It was what the Creation Club should've been like.
---
Fluffy is the Dead Bear pierced by Arrow you need to find for a Side Quest from the Sheepquatsch Questline. The Son of Fluffy is just a Clue in that Sidequest you need to find.
---
How often do they respawn there?
---
That's strange. I have only been in one SBQ fight where she survived. And the loot should be better for her. But there's a loot of loot in the area. And flowers are needed to make flux. The biggest reason I do SBQ is to get flux material.
---
That's most of your problem, I find that the PC community has been very good with working together with events. I can't confirm this but I have a theory that much younger players are on consoles and do whatever they want. Just my opinion.
---
Lol, your English is almost perfect.  Certainly not poor.
---
There entire states in the U.S. where they don't speak English, Alabama for example.
---
Yeah i have no issue with how people spend their money as long as those decision don't affect general gaming going forward. Which some of it has , but it's starting to be pushed back on heavily now. I'm all for supporting a games continued development that's why i usually prefer games like that to have a sub fee (where it makes sense of course) as much as it sucks sometimes. It gives the devs a constant revenue stream without having to try and trick you into spending your money on something you might regret later.
---
Just thinking maybe we can lure them near SS and explode them, I think they do damage to other robots so I don't see why the SS would be any different
---
I love this idea and it would be doable since they were able to do something similar in the Sims 2 even!
---
What? Oxhorn compared gays to pedophiles like 6 months ago. He hasn't changed his views at all he just tries to hide them because he knows if his true views came out like they are now it would destroy his online persona.
---
That explains it. The pierced Yao guai is on the other side of my camp. Next to a dead Vault-Tec scientist?
---
Heavy?
---
Yes everyone votes yes (except the shady people)
---
I sent you a friend request
---
I'd love to know what kind of code repository/versioning system they're using. I can only imagine the push comments: "update 7042, fingers crossed"

Just a bit southeast of Fred’s BBQ. More West than south.
---
If you're going to the queen for weapons you're in the wrong place. I farm whitesprings and West Tek. 3* legendary at West Tek a lot of the times. Got an assassin sentinel robot right leg there yesterday. Got an explosive 10mm smg from White springs later that day. It's not that I'm lucky (my life's proof of that) it's about perseverance. 
---
Also the crap legendaries get put in either the icebox at the golf club or the blue suitcase at the rear entrance of whitesprings. A lot of people find something they want in there. My trash is some other wastelanders treasure.
---
What do you mean? WesTek and the space station are in game.
---
Yup. With this build I’ve got a full set of ultralight Unyielding armor for crafting/selling worn under my PA, I carry like 6 different heavy weapons, probably a hundred grenades and mines of various types, 3 melee weapons that I barely use (ripper, shishkebab, pole hook as they’re all fairly light), 10 mininukes, 40 missiles, 80-100 40mm grenades, 2-3000 50cal rounds,  1-1.5k 5mm rounds, about 1-1.5k .308 rounds, about 1k flamer fuel (rarely use it, too expensive to craft), about 7 power cores. I carry minimal aid, since I don’t use buffs much (I totally should; I’ve been meaning to switch in Party Boy and use Vodka for more health) so I usually only have 5-10 Stimpacks, similar number of diluted ones, and 1-4 radaway, 3-8 diluted radaway. 
---
Plus 1 or 2 of  a random mix of useful chems, a handful of water, and some food. 
---
After all that I can still carry about 30 pounds of loot without being over encumbered (I do have herd mentality and am in a group, plus calibrated shocks on both legs).
---
But since I’m on PC, I’ve also at this point got every single weight reduction perk maxed out and on a hot key swap using Perk Loadout  Manager. I can carry insane amounts with that equipped. So once an area is cleared and combat is over, swap load outs, and fast travel to base/vendor.
---
Haha. That would actually make more sense than disconnected- Digital Combustion being two words n all... Nasty indeed.
---
I discovered during Fasnacht that the church in Helvetia is full of squirrels.
---
I mean it's kind of part of the game right now. And also you'd only have to switch it out when you go to vendors, and given that they all share a cap pool it's one stop.
---
Unless you want absolutely everything, the daily and weekly quests are enough, and the global challenges provide about 80 when you finally craft/scrap enough.
---
It's around where bog and savage divide is. There are notes about a couple wanting to grow things, and 2 skeletons in a bed at the top of the watch tower. 
---
It was dark when I was there.
---
Ok. Good to know. That makes sense. That system works. I retract my opinion.
---
I’ll take one of the outfits for 1k if you still have them?
---
Ahhhh......I like this idea....good PRO Tip
---
Oh no :( I know that doesn't mean it's duped but I did buy mine on the market. Xb1?
---
If I am in the market place and want to add someone as a friend, do I give them my old name or new one
---
Chance for more legendary rolling pins to drop :)
---
This is great news! So glad the dungeons are able to be done co-op and even attempted solo. I was worried they'd make you have 4+ players.
---
Yup, it's the best drop I've ever gotten. I only dream it was a quad as well, sigh.
---
Bethesda reveals Sheepsquatch and Todd Howard had an “intense sexual relationship”

Absolutely, add me psn Welcometothefunk

So you dont even know what you're tslking about with d2 giod to know. Tell me more aboit these runes with prefixes and suffixes. Also tell me if end game bosses don't have guaranteed high end loot you must not have been around for ubers or helffire Diablo.
---
You know its not bethesdas doing right? Like why would they intentionally just say nope screw japan. They wouldn't. Its vlearly a legal issue and they are probably doing what their doing on a lawyers advice.
---
My problem lately is not even being able to select power connectors. I’m looking right at them and they won’t glow until I’m like 5 feet away.
---
You fight an end game boss that can give you a max level 3* legendary
---
The item you have to buy for a 6% chance costs like 2500 caps, man. You’d be better off buying the atom shop one.
---
Yeah explosive will do that.
---
I uses the small conduit on a rug trick. I use to be super fancy with the conduits but like you said they are a PAIN and take more budget.

i can do it, will be able to log on in about half an hour

It worked a lot better before Patch...5? 6? Anyway, the method he was using to allow the game to directly contact an external server (where the loadouts were stored) was removed, which made it impossible to edit/create loadouts on the fly. The current version uses text strings stored in a local .ini file, but you have to pre-load the .ini file with your loadouts, so it's only truly useful at endgame when all your SPECIAL points are unlocked and allocated the way you want them, and the perk cards you want are all unlocked and leveled. So you're not missing as much as you once were.
---
It has been like this for weeks, they know it is happening and are going to some day fix it.
---
I hope the future brings photo frames we can display them in.
---
Finally got mine about 2 weeks ago.  Safe and sound in my stash..hmmmm unless I was sleep walking last night and ate it?  Better check when I get on next time
---
Think your replying to the wrong person I never said anything about her health.
---
Its the only thing im missing lmao
---
Haha *precious*
---
&gt;but it may be complaining different when it comes out
---
I know this is a typo, but it's perfect.
---
No matter what the system is when it is revealed, people will complain about it.
---
SPOILER
---
He's upstream from Site Alpha
---
I think eyebots set off mines. Will test.
---
It's actually a feature to not waste your money
---
Hang tough. These type of queen fights happen.
---
I've got a quad explosive Combat shotty and boy oh boy do I kill myself a lot with it when Ghouls attack me XD But it's useful against big mobs, but severely worse damage after the great nerf
---
It's a legal issue. Not a bethesda just deciding the fuck over japanese users one.
---
One guy is wearing the diver suit from far harbor, as far as I’m aware I think that’ll be new to 76
---
Slightly confused by the lack of any mention of the actual Sheepsquatch missing from the last update. But then again, I guess they probably wouldn't want to spoil the surprise.
---
For Aerodynamic, I just dinged my Unarmed melee alt to 40 and equipped a set of Heavy BOS armor I crafted, fully modded. I put Aero on both arms. I was wondering if it worked (I’ve noticed some other things don’t stack) so I started testing. Without them equipped, I went from 65 max AP to 26, so my Unarmed PA normally costs 39. 
---
I equipped one arm, did it again. 65 to 31, so now only costs 34.
---
Equipped the second, same thing with 65 to 31, so same 34 cost.
---
Use the quad version.  Its not about damage, its about keeping it frozen more.
---
I want to grow firecaps so bad.
---
I'm not saying one isn't more effective than the other, metal is conductive and leather isn't, but a sufficiently powerful energy weapon will damage both. One could argue it would be easier to punch through leather than to heat metal enough to melt through.
---
They spawn exactly like every other in-world item.
---
Yes when leaving and re-entering a blast makes it bug out and forget to irradiate you.
---
womp womp
---
You on Xbox? If so add me. I'll help take her down.  I'm a decently high level and have a okay build I think. Gt is UnblestBiscuit
---
Yeah, that’s what I assumed and what all my listed math is based on.
---
I'm glad to know that 76 is like a second home for more than just me. Medical issues can make living a full, culturally accepted life difficult, I'm happy in my life, to be clear, but having this "place" and a player group of like-minded people, added on with the larger separation of pvp play v casual, I continue to enjoy the peace that comes with the play &lt;3
---
lol what
---
Follow the stream up the hill from Site Alpha. I moved there from Morgantown right before update...and the quest now runs thru my camp. Oops.
---
This has been happening for months, since like... Patch 5 (which ever one they made the Crafting/Repairing not consume mods).
---
It doesn't look like it will be fixed any time soon.
---
Bulking doesn't actually reduce weight (other than the loss of plastic) except for Lead/Aluminum.  So carrying bulked junk serves no real purpose and shouldn't be done unless you are selling Bulk.
---
There are a few 'standard' places that people leave loot they don't need, it's a pretty common practice.
---
With the changes to Whitespring, I'm not sure how standard that place is, but most train stations have a container or two near the vendor that becomes the de facto drop spot for these things.  Usually a suitcase or lunch box, or even the cash register that is generally right next to the vendor.
---
If this is the new dlc, i am gonna be pissed...
---
Uh, might want to do more research as todd howard himself said the last like 6 months was an all hands on deck and everyone from all of their studios worked on fo76 to get it out.
---
As for your engine comment, nowherr did I say they were both on the same engine. Fo76 is on the modified gamebryo engine while ESO was on the old starwars mom engine.
---
As of now they are all on the Responder vendor in Whitespring.
---
Puzzled... I'm not sure what specifically you're suggesting.   
---
&amp; how did Fallout contribute to being sex positive?
---
This is a great idea
---
I'm wondering what the right sub is, since FO4 isn't online, how can he being dropped?
---
I have a 2 shot 3* cryolator for sale. Cost:  explosive handmade
---
I'm a sneak build so I always do a ballcheck.
---
It's not an MMO, but the very design of Fallout 76 is meant to keep players coming back. To do that, you need incentives, and end game loot -- something you can only get by doing certain tasks -- is one of them. It could be plans, CAMP accessories, wearables, costumes, skins, etc.
---
Otherwise, once you complete all the journey and have explored anything, why come back? Why do repeated events? In a game filled with perks they're yet additional perks to incentivize people to keep playing.
---
My bro has one of those, I think. I always laugh when he kills himself. Lots of cursing over the mic. xD
---
It wasn't a hot fix they said it was server maintainance
---
I keep hearing about this game, should I take the plunge?
---
You can move around. But it makes you more vunerable. You only need to tag the ISS once anyways. 
---
I usually stick myself behind a conductor and go thru stims to keep the shield down. I melee but use my lever to take down ranged enemies or eyebots closing in on me.
---
//DONT DELETE THIS CODE GAME WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT IT FOR SOME REASON
---
The area was overpopulated by squirrels, possum and other small animals during Fasnacht on purpose to get intestines for the butcher.  Unless BGS forgot to reset the spawns back to normal (which wouldn't surprise me at all), Helvetia should normally just have low level Scorched and a random pack of 2-3 small animals on the top of the hill heading up to the lookout tower to the south.  I go there a lot for "collect wood" challenges because there's a huge pile of split firewood behind Freya's restaurant and a bunch of deadfalls on the way to the crashed plane.
---
There have been ten trillion posts in the past six months saying this same thing.  But this is the one that'll finally make it happen.  Congrats, OP.
---
I think PSN is undergoing maintenance right now, which could be the problem. I can’t send messages to anyone until it’s over.
---
we are still getting 4 player vault raids!! I like the fact that we get 2 man dungeons and 4 player raids intead of 4 man dungeons and 12 player raids or some shit.
---
we are legion, for there are many of us
---
I named my Gas Mask with Goggles "Are you my mummy?"
---
My 2 power armors are just PA Excavator and PA T60.
---
I'll probably name my weapons something I find funny at some point.
---
Good point, thanks!
---
Oh. Didn't know it had that happen. A shame, but based on description I kinda understand why. Many thanks for the info!
---
Thr mods don't say it's true? You might want to read ths top post from them. Here I'll help you, here is the direct important quote from the mods:
---
&gt;The post breaks no rules, and people are posting facts about him and his views
---
The lag is so bad
---
I really hope they give the perk card system an overhaul... how it got through bethesda in house testing is just baffling, it’s an extremely poorly designed and tedious system at the moment.
---
I got my first SBQ kill last night for the first time in a month, I almost cried lol.
---
I will upvote any post about more faction gear.  Enough Vault tec crap already.  BOS for life ⚙
---
I get maybe 7 people showing up most of whom are about level 45 with maybe one or two level 100+ and they never do anything. When I see her health is basically not moving I’ll stop and look at what everyone and doing and 99% of the time they’re just fucking standing there or trying to hide from adds. It is infuriating. I’ll even server hop until I find one with a lot of higher level players and it’s always the lows that show up anyway. I wouldn’t even care that much if I didn’t have to do so much monotonous prep every time I want to fight her. I have to spend like 300+ caps fast traveling around for codes and the keycard for *one* silo, then I have to farm a ton of lead and steel since I’m a heavy guns build which is a bunch of server hopping and fast travel, and do the damn silo runs. All on limited time to play per week due to my work and other obligations so all my free game time goes down the drain grinding and failing this event.
---
I'd been going there for awhile to get squirrels long after Fasnacht... although I haven't checked since the latest patch. Fingers crossed! Ooo, yeah, I forgot about the wood...
---
There was. Todd and a bunch of the Bethesda devs were at Pax and did a panel like 2 weeks ago where they talked for about an hour about everything including the purveyor. Just google Bethesda pax east 2019 or something, twitch has a recording.
---
I want this so bad. I have tons of awesome pictures I want to share.
---
Your English is wonderful!
---
Hajimemashite, tomodachi.
---
Wasteland de nukashine o nomimasenka.
---
(I just started learning nihongo.)
---
On the whole it's a great change, but it's definitely going to impact player to player trade prices. Why sell serums to people for 250 each when I can get 600+ from the vendors now?
---
Thank you for saying the mic thing. Not everyone wants to talk I understand negotiating prices but I really hate talking to some of y'all lol.
---
Zenimax is not part of Bethesda Game Studios. Zenimax OWNS Bethesda Game Studios. When Todd said all of their studios worked on it, he was talking about BGS Maryland, Montreal, Austin, and Dallas. You're the one that needs to do more research.
---
My point with the engine was that if they're not using the same engine, they're going to work the same way. You can't just take code from one engine and stick it into a completely different engine and expect it to work.
---
Yeah it makes no sense to grow corn next to a fungus.
---
Ok Justin Timberlake.
---
It was directly after. Sold to you..went back to my camp to grab another for trade and boom.. ghosted
---
Hi thanks for your report! We're working on a fix for this and it's currently slated for our next update.
---
The originals depict sex slavery and liberty based sex work as well as allowing the player to do seduction as a mechanic. Perks in fallout 2 specifically deal with it. This is sex positivity to include it rather than hide and promote the shame problem.
---
I am suggesting that we remember we are a community and to have unity and positivity. I want discussion in this realm, there are a lot of people really upset to hear about some features that may or may not be coming. I want to developers and the team that talks to them to see that we have a vision, and some of our best creative players have helped to demonstrate that. Let us show gratitude.
---
I read a thread yesterday from a guy that said the more people on the event doesn't actually change her health at all. I wish I could find the thread.
---
So I hear.
---
It would be awesome if they moved them upstairs into that big empty room and set them up convention center style. Each could have a small "booth" with some wares and faction recruitment items sitting on/in the booth like posters, balloons or small figures, etc. Basically like a convention. 
---
It would give it a more lore/organic feel rather then them just idly standing in different stores.
---
Or at least unique drops from this dungeons and raids
---
I’m on the black loading screen right now, should I wait in the hope the quest completes or?..... help!

 &gt; Hi thanks for your report! We're working on a fix for this and it's currently slated for our next update.
---
Nowhere did I say they'd release lrivatd servers. MODDERS already are more than half way done reverse engineering the servers.
---
Survival isnt about making caps.
---
Ill help too..im a SBQ monster.....and i hate all the things you mentioned. Fighting the queen is one of the funnest things in the game imo
---
Ive had similar experiences where everyone shows up and hides....frustrating..
---
Anyway. If u post on here before u launch and ask for help from people who actually want to fight. It usuallly works out.  But add me, ill help. Name is the same as on here......the 0 is a zero
---
My gatling plasma felt weird - at times I couldn't spin it up - didn't pay too much attention but I guess it fired that single shot, then had to be spun up again.  Felt like it was "stuck" at times.  What a waste - I was pretty happy with how it was operating prior to the patch even with it not really showing ammo remaining when you first use it.  At least that made sense!
---
I can relate XD
---
Good point though i'll add that to the text up top
---
I'm also pretty sure that this is a problem from those nasty people called "knights". Knights in middle of the 21st century? C'mon.
---
Lol you're completely contradicting yourself. I remind you that your in your first post you said you have "high confidence" that there'll be no rerolling of existing items. That's speculation.
---
The problem with that in general is the spoilage on plants. Even if you sacrifice the 3 luck to max out Good with Salt, it's still pretty obnoxious.
---
Being able to plant even a limited amount of certain plants in your camp reduces that artificial restraint just a bit and is more of a quality of life change than an outright enabler for people to fully afk in their camp as you seem to think it would allow.
---
If you want to give it another go I can help out around 6:30pm est this evening, and I'm sure there are many others that would be willing to help as well.  shoot me a message if you're interested and I'll rally some troops.
---
Generally speaking, it's great to pop over here and make a thread when you're going to launch so people that will actively participate get a heads up.
---
I got a 3\* Tesla Rifle.
---
Oh it seems to be psn and not Beth
---
Ya. I bought mine like 3 months ago though
---
It is really nice how events scale up to the 12 player territory.  That way I don't have to go find 11 friends to play the game with me for a raid but I can still have those larger boss fights from everyone showing up.
---
I don’t think the designers want you to be able to do that IMO. It seems kinda cheesy if you get ambushed or something just being able to quick swap to defensive or offensive cards.
---
Yea evidently I replied to the comment of the comment instead of the comment I wanted to. Sorry about that!
---
I see what you’re saying, unlock all the plans and in theory should unlock your base. Maybe I’ll try that out before I rebuild thanks for the suggestion. 🤘
---
Hopefully we will catch each other online later.
---
Fairly sure it means your game's crashed.
---
Already nerfed bloodied builds with modified adrenal reaction and modified bloodied effect. To fix the whole sentinal assassin deal they need to fix it. While standing still doesn't mean jumping like jack rabbits. Can't jump and stand still at the same time. Lol. I think it would be fine if the effects did what they were supposed to.
---
Yep, you were right, shit!
---
Technically it's still source: me but at least I have some evidence to back up what I'm saying this time
---
I use a PC mod that lets me do that. The issue with it is that it becomes a bit over powered and half ways defeats the purpose of the entire system.
---
When fighting the SBQ I have a loadout for rifles including damage perks and VATS targeting. Let's me do great  damage while she's flying. As soon as I see her go into her landing  animation I hit "Tab-&gt;T-&gt;2-&gt;Esc". Boom, just as she lands I'm  fully respec'd into huge unarmed damage. Took 2 seconds max to do it. 
---
I do this all the time when swapping between weapons in different scenarios. I'm strength heavy and have Unarmed, 1-handed, 2-handed, heavy guns, and shotgun; plus a build for Rifles. That's just the combat builds and it takes 2 seconds to swap to whatever I want to use. With how quick I can swap, I'm half sure I could use it in PvP provided I could find cover for 2-3 seconds.
---
I also use it to keep weight reduction perks on and quick  swap to damage and defense builds as soon as I see enemies. And as you mentioned I have a build that has my lockpicking, hacking, and scrapping put into it.
---
If there was a vanilla one, it would be best to only have it usable only at team  C.A.M.P.S. or Workshops although the PC mod makes it a moot point unless  they issued bans for bypassing game mechanics.
---
It js the recent fallout 4 morality videos that came out right before fo76 did, I can't remember if it is the "is it moral to leave synth Sean" but it was right in that time frame. He mentions that homosexuality was okay in ancient Greece then in his next breath brings up "pedophile was also seen as okay and beastiality as well"
---
Its probably one of the most underrated and forgotten about weapons. I always carry mine into large events like the SSQ and SBQ.
---
Do n t
---
I have 100s of them from just normal use of 5 small purifiers and quest/even rewards.  Not sure I need anything to make it farm _more_...
---
Ok, glad it's working for you, the mentioned 'politics' aside (I hope it's not, 'I pirated the game but still want to buy in-game currency!'), but please don't come back here whining how they banned your account(s) after they made the connection (red-flagged you for using false credentials).
---
Anyone following your advice should be warned, because Bethesda doesn't like exploits.
---
Lol about the same.
---
I found fluffy....but not the son. Have to check this out today
---
I mean if I go clear it out now, how long until the jackets respawn so I can do it again?
---
Yeah, the Vault Tec stuff is getting out of hand. We need a lot more camp stuff than this, but if they want to talk about building the community they need to let us actually choose a faction and represent.
---
As sad as it seems, this comment needs to be higher. Hopefully you're wrong, and they can, but this helps explain why it's restricted to the Japanese player base.
---
Hey! You were just at my camp in game!!
---
In case first shot doesn't kill,  you can sneak a second one in... /s
---
I have not seen a legendary down there since the patch and I've been there a good bit.
---
Its cocked.
---
Seems normal to me had 5  Three star bots there just the other day
---
I mean preaching to the choir here! The BoS are xenophobic assholes so I hate the BoS and Enclave equally xD
---
I think PSN is down, I’m having trouble with adding you and nothing is loading.
---
Let me guess, you're a PC with mods
---
&gt; Mind you I do not actively seek out PvP nor do I really like to do it but I absolutely love the danger it brings.
---
Exactly my thoughts as well.  They didn't add any human characters because well... one would *assume* those human characters are *supposed* to be players.  This should have made the wasteland more dangerous and exciting.
---
I don't actively seek out PvP either, but I'd like there to be real marauders or psychopaths out and about, like a real wasteland experience should have.
---
Its not their fault, this is directly a mods/ini files issue.
---
To expand a bit:
---
&gt;Activate pylons (it'll pop up on screen) the conduit should have stims to spare/spam.
---
If possible, try to have 3 different people each activate a pylon. The DoT is so fast it's almost impossible to keep up if 1 person tries to take all 3. Also, the Squatch goes aggro on the conduits, so after you activate one try to climb up on the roof of the cabin or run in circles around it to keep from being 1HK'd by her punching attacks.
---
Lastly, when you're in the injured state you continue to act as a conduit until you actually die. It's hard to pull this off without teammates, but if possible try not to revive downed conduit players too quickly.
---
&gt;Hit the Imposter only when it is vulnerable. (Otherwise it's an ammo dump)
---
Yup. If she's invisible don't bother firing. It's just a straight up waste of ammo.
---
&gt;Lower levels should concentrate on mobs, Only because they keep spawning and the Imposter will decimate said lower levels with ease.
---
Yes, yes, yes. PSA to low level players: if you have the Robotics Expert perk, this is a great time to use it. There's a cap of some sort on the number/type of mobs that will spawn at any given time, so if you can pacify a bunch of them it'll make things less hectic for everyone.
---
One other tip: anything you can do to slow her down will be a lifesaver for the melee tanks. Cryo grenades and the cryolator are both very effective.
---
Who knows. At the time cryolators weren't very popular. Mines only a 2 star too. Seemed unlikely it was a duper special.
---
and tweaked ini files
---
It as a camo stock even though it says standard paint on it.
---
Or maybe placing a GECK within a nuke zone creates a jungle of radiated plants!
---
Well the assumption would be that I paid for the game and paid for the system to play that game, but ok.
---
I mean, the pump grip is not forward
---
It’s got camo and you didn’t buy it from atom shop 
---
My pumps are camo now too
---
It’s an online game that gets constantly updated and it does not support mods. Get ready to have a bad time.
---
I've been trying for days and can't figure it out. Do you mind helping?
---
That what mine is too. I think some explosive energy weapons got duped. Idk the person I got it from seems nice and I don't really care because Bethesda isn't gonna take it anyways.
---
If you mean the bit at the cabin with the pylons it's an event anyway, the questline's already finished.
---
The real Sheepsquatches were the friends we made along the way.
---
I appreciate this as much as you do
---
I've fought the sheepsquatch twice without any card??  Only killed it once though with a solid team, other time was me and three lower levels, we got wrecked
---
Thank you kindly for this! I was short on time so I had to go the cliff notes route.
---
Yeah youll need a buddy to open that door for you
---
People on PS4 have you the same problem? PSN friend list broken now?
---
Yep.
---
I'd like it if my team owns a work shop, that they could fast travel to it instead of only the owner being able to!
---
That's been there for a long time. I had my CAMP on the Black Titanium node on those cliffs for a while. No clue how to open the safe.
---
I have never gotten a pie from that machine, in both Fallout 4 and 76. My friend has gotten several with his 15 Luck in 76. I may have called him a whore... a few times.
---
There just aren't enough buttons on a controller to have separate key binds for everything. I don't even know what the "attach wire" function could be mapped to.
---
So are you just waiting for an acceptable time to jump into the game based on your own critical analysis of the game's status? Or do you just like to follow it's progress as they continue to make changes and updates without actually playing it? 
---
I've been playing it since it launched but wish I would have waited until it went on sale two weeks after release. But, hey, everyone makes mistakes.
---
I enjoy the game enough to not be bothered by its faults and issues and will continue to play it until it no longer interests me.
---
Everyone was just killing everyone for caps without a second thought. I don’t think that’s what they want the mode to be limited to.
---
But since the update like 48 hrs ago have you
---
Bethesda is no better.  Today's inside the vault.... Go down this specific manhole... Find this note.  For a game with so many people complaining there isn't enough to do and everything getting a YouTube video 10 minutes after release showing how to do it I almost wish they would just say "hey, there's a new thing in the world, you'll find it soon enough".
---
So umm, where are the repair kits??
---
You still might. Just not yet. There are hints that there may be one (glitches and such), but we don't really know for certain.
---
what? how did you "pirate" an mmorpg that requires a verified account with a real key?
---
Originally they were marked locations that you could discover and fast travel to. They're unmarked now.
---
The only thing I would suggest is giving your account information to a trusted friend or service in the United States that has the game and having them buy atoms for your account, or certain items you’d want. But I’d take that with a grain of salt considering Apple has iCloud accounts tagged with specific countries for music or apps, and Sony could also be doing the same with Playstation accounts. 
---
BTW: I love the Japanese, your so respectful and kind, nice! Hope you get your atoms soon buddy!
---
&gt;Noticed something is up with the pump shotguns.
---
Is it that the Weapon Plans are not sold anywhere?
---
(more serious) Maybe the silencer rotates out of the way when loading?
---
Sorry if I misread you, yes I know why people hate turret camps there, but the above is not what you wrote originally, 'Other side from the clubhouse on the green' reads like directly behind the clubhouse to me. Sorry again if my grasp of the English language is not perfect! Mercy upon you then, after all. ;-)

# Leveling
---
**1-15**: Do your responder quests all the way up to the point where it sends you to Top of the World to unlock various workbenches and for easy early game exp. Use whatever weapons you get. Hunting rifle is fairly good - will one shot most enemies assuming you have one appropriate for you level. Melee is also a good option. Taking the Poseidon Power Plant and doing the "Powering Up" event there 3 times will give you all 3 power generator plans (including fusion) for free. Plus you can get some fusion cores stocked up, and it provides a free fast travel point. Lots of scorched and good loot inside as well.
---
NOTE: If you don't have a **raider set of power armor**, Go to **Cliffwatch** (look it up here  [https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/) ). Server hop until you have a full set of level 15 raider power armor, killing the scorched there (good exp / scrap from weapons and easy to learn most of their weapon mods this way). If you plan to do this, put your camp down in the hils above their camp. I'd start this at level 10 if you have nothing. Swapping to Survival Mode might be a good option here - less PvE players looking for low level power armor sets there.
---
**15-25**: Do Rose's raider faction quest if you want. It's not required for the other faction quests, and in my opinion, it's a bit dull (although I like Rose's voice actress, the quests are somewhat boring IMO). Be sure to do the quest at **Camp McClintock** for your Soldier's Certificate (needed later). New Gad is a decent grind spot for this level range, or alternatively, just explore and gather / kill as you go in the Ash Heap. There's a lot to see, and a big part of the fun is exploring the map and finding all the excellent holotapes and learning the stories of those who didn't make it. Take at least Poseidon Power Plant and defend it as necessary (these quests are great for leveling)
---
**25-50**: Do the [Miner Miracles](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Miner_Miracles) quest and get your free Excavator power armor. Have someone craft you a Gatling Laser or two. Seriously - I'll do it if you're on PC or someone on the community for your console will if you ask. This community here is really nice. You're going to start going up against level 25-40 enemies that require quite a bit more DPS than what you're used to, so you will need sustained firepower with easily obtained ammo. That's where the Gatling Laser shines. Works particularly well against super mutants and mole miners, which are high health but lightly armored. Disover and take all 3 of the power plant workshops. Make sure you lock the fusion core generator or people will just take your cores. There's no penalty for this. You can craft Fusion Generators instead of doing the "Powering Up" event, which takes a long time, although the ones at Monogah and Thunder Mountain are worth your time, since the mobs there scale up to your level to some degree, and there are lots of them. If someone contests, you can try to fight, but in my experience this is very rare. Ask nicely if they wouldn't mind letting you have it, but if they insist on taking it, that's just how it goes sometimes.
---
Do the various events that come up, discover which ones give the best loot / exp. Distant Thunder is very worth it for the chance to get rare power armor plans. AWOL Armaments is a guaranteed 3 star legendary enemy. Save up caps. You'll want a few thousand by level 50 so you can buy a bloodied Gatling Gun and/or bloodied .50 Cal and the mutation serums you need. Most people will be happy to craft all of those for you for 200-300c per serum. Just make sure you have Starched Genes rank 2 on or you could lose them. Craft lots of .50 Cal ammo with the Super Duper / Ammosmith perk. 
---
Explore the map. Enjoy the stories of all the dead people. Have fun, in a depressed, gloomy way (I say that in jest, but I really enjoy it)!

At 45 you can craft you end game set of Excavator Power Armor, though you may want to wait until you have all the crafting perks for it to make it cheaper. Higher int (up to 20 I think) when crafting = higher base durability on it. 
---
**50+**: The end game. Do the Enclave quest to unlock the ability to nuke, as well as a free set of X-01 power armor. This is great power armor, but the mods are very rare. You can buy plans for power armor mods of every type but X-01, however, you get the plans for base pieces of X-01 for free (but you need to get materials to craft it). Also do the Brotherhood of Steel quests to unlock a free set of Ultracite power armor. You can get Ultracite mod plans from the Scorchbeast queen, which you'll be doing a lot of. 
---
Nuke Whitesprings and farm ghouls to save up Glowing / Hardened mass and High Radiation Fluid. You'll get lots of Glowing Blood which is great for selling to vendors, as well as Ionized meat. Bloodied Gatling Gun is a good choice for this due to ammo efficiency and being able to one shot Glowing Bloated Ghouls. Nuclear Material sells well too.
---
Nuke Fissure Site Prime and farm SBQ for Prime Receiver plans until you get them all. Gather Violet Flux / ultracite and craft Stable Violet Flux (sells for 100c per, used for making most desirable ultracite ammo types).
---
Trade. Gather. Save up caps. Buy plans for the things you want to make. Finish picking up all the crafting / situation perks in the build. Make friends so you can reload Whitesprings and farm it over and over after nuking. When you learn .50 cal prime receiver, you can make .50 cal ultracite ammo. Farm steel from mutants at West-Tek. Mine lead at Lucky Hole mine. Smelt lead with acid farmed from Toxic Larry's meat (snallygasters) or that you've gathered. Make lots of ammo. Sell or use it. Learn all the plans. Offer more services. Run end game dungeons (they will definitely be out by the time you're at end game). 
---
Reset your level for more powerful abilities (new system coming later this year) to become a "legendary" player. Farm legendary items and trade them into purveyor (coming next month) for tokens to use to reroll legendaries in that search for the ultimate GG weapon (a bloodied 25% fire rate .50 Cal). 
---
Try other, inferior character builds and wind up turning them into mules because your main is so much stronger. (I jest, but this has happened to me).
---
Ah, gotcha.
---
Looks normal to me. 
---
But it's tough to gauge if a change to an RNG system happened based on assorted anecdotes.
---
The graphics are dated but the concept plays out really well.  In that game you and your companions are literal nobodies and they can be maimed or die at any time.  Survival is an endless struggle, and just when you think you're good at it they prove you wrong.  It's such a dark, sadistic pleasure but if you like base building games and the ability to customize damn near everything about your people and your towns, it's definitely worth playing.  I'd definitely watch a few youtube videos first, at least to learn the mechanics.
---
I've done a dozen Watoga runs since the last main patch and -0- legendaries. At first I thought it was an accident but There's some speculation that Beth nerfed all incidenced legendary robot spawns to -0- due to the overwhelming number of bots during the final sheepsquatch quest.
---
Free camo paint!
---
But what about after the update??
---
So, is the Burrows going to be instanced dungeon or open world dungeon?
---
Also what's the deal with the camera, they will immediately make mods for it, but can't make more mods for items all ready in the game or fix the acquiring of mods on some items.
---
Btw you can fast travel away happened to my buddy.
---
owe my soul *
---
&gt; Are all mounted heads added to the droppable loot tables now? I got a few during this quest line.
---
I tried testing this last night, and the answer is either "No", or "Yes, but very rarely." I claimed 6 workshops and did the defense events for each one, and the only plans I received were duplicates of CAMP objects I already have (which is pretty much all of them).
---
&gt; Maybe the silencer rotates out of the way when loading
---
You really don't understand how shotguns work, do you...
---
Haha appropriate response for that whore :P. It works on luck and the number of attempts. But I really want one on the first go, just to say it happened.
---
Built by people who have proven you CAN apparently forget how to ride a bike.
---
Don't worry, there's nothing significant that changes the gameplay, just enough to keep the loyal grinding away.
---
Love this idea and green houses!
---
Can confirm, and it's a good tactic. Big ups, OP.
---
Just for the records, the fact that it didnt scrap bulks *was* the bug. Beth said bulk has always been intended to be part of scrap all. As in it's supposed to be coded that way. 
---
They admitted to needing new tech entirely to properly ignore bulk scrap.
---
Now if I can find people to play with who understand this :(
---
Oh, oh DLC quest rewards I think the necessity of it being something special is GREATLY increased. Totally agreement.
---
Pick your server before launching, check the map and see how many high levels are hanging around.
---
Aaaand the camera got delayed too. :))
---
works for me on ps4
---
Sure.
---
If you want a full walkthrough, here's one for you:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKYa6lkbh6A
---
If you just want a hint -- it's hard to say which one you're missing if I don't know which ones you have.  But the most commonly missed one involves the bone.  You found the bone, right?  Do you know what to do with the bone?  Examine it closely.  There's a clue on the bone itself.  And somewhere in the building to use it...
---
How dare you imply we are mythinformed!
---
To expand on this, there will be only two ways to get atoms: the trickle you get from challenges, or with real world money. 
---
It is possible they will allow you to buy caps with real money at some point as outlined above.
---
I see. Maybe from the repeatable squatch event.
---
Sorry, somehow either I replied to the wrong post or my comment got attached to the wrong post. (Probably the former.)
---
Damn, man yeah sorry to hear this, I hope things work out for you. I just got my 1st Queen on Alt, was mostly good laggy because way way too many show up, because noone been running Queen on PC on due to Beta mode I guess which I just got sick of and went back to Reg. only to have someone loot my junk bag at the queen lol...
---
A few people have offered to do the Queen with me but unfortunately I don’t have the time right now. I’ll try and get invites to everyone who offered the next chance I get to launch on her. Thanks for offering I really appreciate it.
---
Does that work on ticks for getting blood?
---
With certain mods, sure! I think I used Wacky Weapons Workshop.
---
I can tell you it's not a 1 star tire iron that grants extra damage against super mutants
---
I think they’d have to improve their servers first, since the photos would be stored there instead of it being client-based.
---
As cool as this would be the strain it would put on a server would probably suck.
---
Really? I did that side quest and I never even saw this (living) bear. I saw a Yao Guai, but it wasn't a named legendary.
---
Still have seen many 1 stars. And one 3 star but have not farmed it enough to say it’s nerfed , cause even before patch I’d it servers that we crap and server jump and hit the motherload
---
So even westek is nerfed then? Cause then it's only worth it to farm events now to get legendaries
---
The CAMP isn't. Not sure where the location itself is.
---
It would be kind of funny to go there and build a replica. ;)
---
İ dont think its real if it is player already found it already
---
I know survivals not about making caps. I like the sense of danger and having to watch your back more than anything, but when its been nerfed to the point that you can wipe a whole team yourself and dominate everyone who comes for you. In return you get 100 caps and a few purified water, no thanks man id rather not waste my ammo.
---
I'm still not understanding how people think repair kits are p2w. You aren't winning anything. All these kits are allowing you to do is keep in the fight longer. Nothing about it is pay to win. Would people be upset if you could craft them? Would it still be p2w? I get that people are afraid that Bethesda is going to start selling 3 star weapons, but any rational people would know they'd never do that. Now, if they started selling level boosters or items that would help you survive PVP, THEN I'd worry.
---
Unless you have repair kits
---
Yes. Though it seems a lot less reliable post patch 7.
---
It's bloody massive
---
I guarantee 100% that the real squash is not in the game yet. And it will be. Because the Imposter and the Squatch from the trailer look nothing alike.
---
Looking at you, ALL RISE
---
&gt; They believe 60$ entitles an infinite continuance of content. Wh
---
yes, b/c that's what they advertised. imagine being able to belive what someone says.  what a world to be alive in.
---
They should allow direct gifting of actual items from the atom shop.
---
Do you mean Sunshine MEADOWS industrial farm? Tidings co-op is a Fallout 4 settlement.
---
It is actually, the tube is just really long.
---
Fuck dude, I am sorry to hear that. I haven't noticed anything missing but I haven't had a chance to look and won't be able to for another 5 or 6 hours.
---
If it is I demand a shoutout at least!
---
Seriously, this way one person can hold all 3 conduits at the cost of 1 stim every 30 seconds, at "worst."
---
I do the Tea Time event solely for Rad Ant spawns. Idk where to find them otherwise. Same with Irrational Fear for Honeybeasts.
---
You can but the black terminal overlay with be over every screen. Even over the pause menu
---
Well like I said, it's just the bots. (If the speculation is correct.) So the WestTek muties and the Whitespring ghouls and all the rest should be normal (and seem to be normal) but Watoga, for the time being at least, is a desert.
---
Yea its a real kick in the nads. Feels like my dog died
---
Lol I'd would honestly be into that. Throw on few perk cards farm West Tek and get a better legendary.
---
I hear you though mutant slayers stuff is about the only specific enemy legendary effect that is worth anything. Other then ghouls slayers. But these are tools for farmers so it makes sense.
---
Why is wood armor in the game? Is it intended for sneaky snipers?
---
This happens to me as well. I don't know why, but if you plug in headphones to the controller audio jack, the sound comes back in game. 
---
This drives me nuts..
---
Will be*
---
PS4?
---
3 star legendary enemies should only drop max level legendary items imho
---
In addition to what you've heard here, there are things that create synergies to make Bloodied a potentially very powerful but very risky build out strategy.
---
Between the perks that can block, dodge, or reduce damage, perks and Unyielding gear gear that can massively increase stats and damage at low health, you can create a build that runs around at low health, deals ridiculous damage per hit, and is still relatively sturdy, but quite vulnerable against certain enemies. The new Encryptid event chews up my bloodied build.
---
I feel the both of you, so sad having to put one of your fav weapons away ;_;
---
KNowing Bethesda Plasma is heated blood we are shooting at enemies.
---
There is an entire build for this fight - int robot pacifism, quack dr to revive, mysterious reviver. I really hate the respec system though. It's the biggest downfall for wanting to try any other build.
---
Nah, I won’t make a decision of when its playable again. I will just jump in when I see the player-base rising.
---
That's possible, though I did that several times and the only plans I got were 2 copies of the Fixer.
---
Plot twist: it actually wiped his characters and he lost everything. He just wants other to experience his loss.
---
That sounds right up my alley, thanks!
---
Jesus. I don’t know if you made that up, but that’s a quality insult.
---
You forgot to explain how "hoes" fit into this...
---
That’s what I did on my 2nd character, just a shame my 1st character is stuck with a Lvl 20 Perfect Storm and a Lvl 10 Two Shot Revolver, but such is life I guess :)
---
Honestly knowing them it could be
---
'Two level 50+' huh? Then one 100+ should be just fine.
---
How do you get this event to trigger!? I am so Jelly right now, I want to pummel that guy with my bare hands in my clown costume!
---
Does anyone know if these count as a recon scope for the various events that require one?
---
i can not zoom any weapon in 1st person view, 3rd person works fine
---
Unless you compare against known damage values (eg. convince everyone else to stop shooting and then watch the numbers per hit), that proves nothing. If the queen was scaled server side then it wouldn't be surprising if it still sent client values in the fixed range.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the queen was unscaled since a couple of patches back, but 32k HP, 300 DR and 70% damage reduction still sounds very much on the low side.
---
I stole it from somewhere. Possibly from Deadwood.
---
Since the update I hit watago 3 times spread across a few hours and hit 60ish bots.  Not one was a legendary
---
Agreed; I’ve got my cables coming out of a building via the conduit thing. But it’s flakey as hell trying to get the wires to snap to it! Jumping all over must look incredible to anyone watching!
---
Do we know where the Burrow will be in the map? I don’t know if I have seen that yet. I have a feeling it will be in the Ash heap, as we have been utilizing that area a lot more with the new questions. He even mentions multiple times that Uncanny Caverns is a place where not only himself but someone else had a sighting. It seemed to be the only real sighting he felt he had found.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if The Burrow was nearby and had the actual SheepSquatch
---
Without reading I can assure prostitution is not the answer.
---
Soo I cant be annoyed with the amount of ammo I spent because you spent more? Also I have enough lead+steel to last me til I hit level 100 but plastic is something i find myself always needing. The thing you need a shit ton of for shotgun shells. So yea i was slightly annoyed to burn through 20 minutes worth of a plastic run at morgantown hs. Was it worth it? Yup. Do you sound like a massive child? Yup.
---
Stimpaks and someone to res you.
---
I will be on tonight after work.  Sorry for the delay
---
I agree, I felt the behavior of the gatling energy weapons was in a good point for once.
---
You’ll get the Greek letters set from doing Biv’s daily alcohol tests.
---
Smart! I've been playing this game for months and have never once run out of stimpacks until doing this damn event lol
---
i thought all this same stuff!
---
people can just live at whitesprings now and not even venture to any other part of the map
---
i do enjoy the shared cap pool however
---
Ummm yes please
---
Uniqueness is fine and honestly would be appreciated. But they can’t be strong. The second a unique reward is the meta everyone will complain up a storm. You see it in every loot based game where one quest gives a reward that outshines everything else and suddenly it’s the only weapon worth using. I do like the idea of unique rolls but they just can be OP
---
The beer keg is new but you get greek letters from doing Biv's daily quests. I have gotten like 11 plans for it already...
---
I don't know, and I don't care, as I don't play on PC. And what do you mean by DRI, again? The punk band, or [a method enforcing database integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_integrity#Declarative_Referential_Integrity)? How would either have blacklisted you? So I just assumed you were talking about DRM. :-/
---
Maybe you should play it again, there is no way to finish it that quickly and actually read all the lore. Your issue is you speed rush through everything and don’t take in the quality of the story and what they are telling. If you hate the game stop playing, we don’t need to hear about it here.
---
I know for sure on the safes if you take anything out.
---
Really? Normally I kneecap everything and let the crew clean up. But I've always just retagged the legendaries after it mutated just for the fun.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Weird thing is, when I first logged in, I had the password when I first logged in and noticed the quest missing, I logged back out and now the password is gone
---
A couple things to consider. First, before you do a silo, look at the map and take stock of the different player levels.  If most of the map is ~Level 50 or less, you'll probably have trouble killing her.  Second, if that is the case, consider *including* Drop Site V9 in the blast.  That's where most players will attempt to travel, but the need for Power Armor will keep some of the leechers out.
---
Mild brain fart, I tried to correct it before you responded (caught it within seconds of posting, soon enough to avoid the edit mark, apparently not before you saw it.).
---
Was trying to figure out what the OP thought was wrong, and that maybe he figured he couldn't load ammo into the tube even though it went thru the other end.
---
Weapon Plans still are missing though.  Seem to be the only weapon plan you cannot find on a vendor since the Vendor patch made them all available.
---
Why don’t they just make a faction shop with the spa or hair salon? Not like you can use them right now anyway.
---
It's cooperative because nobody can be killed during events. Once the event is over, it's pure fucking hell.
---
Finished a long, long Sheepsquatch event only to be gunned down by some jackhole with a minigun.
---
it was a typo but... hmm let me think... Lets have sexy vault boys, girls, bots, ghouls, supermutants, scorched, whatever dancing next to your shop. Draws in customers.
---
Making all of that sounds like an awful lot of effort to go to just to fool people.
---
I'd love for the FO4 Robot workbench to be brought in to create camp guards/robotic companions along with the FO4 contraption/factory pieces.
---
I'd love my base actively generating finished resources as opposed to just raw resources.
---
If I'm going to work scrounging in the wasteland, my camp should too.
---
I had it fixed to stable with everything and slider to lowest settings and sync off at 25 fps(my rigs not bad either and I have a solid inet connection), but patch screwed me again and yes it’s unplayable with no room to fix it now. 
---
Games getting shelved.
---
Lol lets hope, god it would be a quality sof life improvement...UPVOTE PEOPLE MAKE THEM LISTEN
---
lol I was like "there's no way someone who plays games with shotguns is this stupid..."
---
It’s to show off the vending machines that players can have in their camps.
---
Cryo from what I've read
---
HOLY SHIT! Maaaaan, what are the odds? 
---
By the way, your camp is absolutely gorgeous. I’m so jealous!
---
Well now I want to watch Deadwood.
---
I want flags that you can put on walls and flagpoles.
---
I just want to say I appreciate all the great advice guys. I will do my best to apply it to this current play through. You are truly awesome thank you for being so cool to another waste land wonderer.
---
Fort defiance. You can get a nice haul of them there if you strike it lucky.
---
The cap loss was double your level.     The higher you level, at some point it becomes not worth bothering with, It encourages exploits like dumping all of your caps on an alt, or transferring all of your gear to a lower level alt once the alt his level 50 and using that character for PVP.
---
Was the quest glitched out and not active or in your quest log like me?
---
Thank You!
---
+Karma
---
I have a greater pain looting a 3star legendary, then seeing its a lvl 25 weapon and i'm lvl 90...
---
\*looks at the giant pile of purified water and canned goods I have gained from normal play\* I suspect the fridge thing is more about preserving buff foods and crafting materials than "you're hungry, so I guess you'll go home instead of just eating something because fridge."
---
How does that work without the crystallize mod?
---
Just did westek and 2* was there
---
Haven't seen a single legendary at WestTek in my past ten runs. But that could be just my bad luck.
---
Been so for over a week now.
---
Given how much complaining is going into the new method of opening the Stash boxes muscle memory is a powerful thing.
---
I agree. Just because a problem exists doesn't mean there is an easy solution. A cursory Google seems to support something like what was described above.
---
Are you using demolition expert 5?
---
Shame on you. Stop presenting opinions as facts.
---
Man that is heartbreaking, I found a lvl 1 but 3 star piece of armor the other day, FeelsBadMan
---
I get that BUT it wouldnt allow for swapping of Special..just the cards...so you would still be limited to within the special points you have but optimization bettet...it could lead to rifleman with strong melee to back it up instead of spamming shots on enemys that gap close...you could be a mixed wrapons master within strength or an adventurer with scavenging perks that also can snipe when the situation arises
---
It’s not a bug, there’s plenty of spots you can toss a grenade there and flush someone that’s hiding behind foundations out, I’ve done it before. You’re just some scrub hiding behind foundations crying “reeeeee!!” when it doesn’t go your way. The devs aren’t gonna give this post a second thought, you might as well delete it honestly.
---
It's an awesome show. It has some of the best written dialogue I've ever heard in a show.
---
Changed my jump from Y to LB when I first started using a controller, yet I still jump when pressing Y for the wires occasionally. Seems like even if you have jump on Y, the workshop Y is still a different way to get your character to jump. Not sure if that is correct but if it is then removing any input to jump while in workshop mode shouldn't affect the jump input for normal mode. Or going into workshop mode temporarily changes your controls, and my fix guess is wrong.
---
Oh this applies to explosive weapons? That explains a lot. Thanks!
---
Also can I go ahead and get an unlimited album for them? Why is it capped? I filled it my first day last month. I thought that it was really cool that they were loading screens. So I took a be lit if pictures :/
---
I saw it pointed out in a YouTube video that the altered conspiracy map in Calvin's room does in fact have a pin over the rough location of the Burrows. So there's a possibility it has some sort of connection to the quest.
---
Did you make it semi or full auto?  That changes what perk set you use.
---
Demo expert does increase the explosive damage a bit too.
---
Enclave plans gun with flame attachment.
---
It seems very dead obvious that perk cards were a loot box type thing until late in development. The whole card pack thing seems like the real system they designed then got rightfully scared right before launch and scrapped for this weird bad system they have now.
---
Lol, delete a few of them
---
Yes it will give you an extra 60% explosive damage on top of what rifleman and bloody mess gives. Happy I could help :)
---
Yeah i agree that they need to cap that at some level so you cant lose too much, but at this point there is basically no risk and no reward.
---
I can't wait to go through a raid or dungeon just to get a one star wood chest piece.
---
EXCELLENT, that's what I was hoping for.
---
someone lend him the power!
---
I've never had a real problem using conduit.  The pass through is the hardest part but my trick has always been to place it from where you want the pass through to happen so you can line up the connector properly and go from there.  
---
If you want it to go outside knowing where you want it to appear is also helpful so you can figure out if you need to adjust the rest of your setup.  
---
I've had to remove walls a few times to get it to snap but never because of a collision issue, the problem is that the snapping for conduit is a bit finicky.   
---
The bottom line with using conduit in a build is planning ahead to make it work properly.
---
I pulled out my gatling plasma and started chewing through everything, then somebody jumped in front of me, and i instantly killed myself... To many people and to much chaos.
---
At least 3 star legendaries from 3 star legendary enemies, for starters.
---
Straighten all your jackets?
---
Manpower.   We killed it fairy quickly when most of the server showed up, and a large chunk of them were below level 50 but everyone was hitting it.   And of course you have to activate that device which makes it vulnerable.
---
That's a good idea, I might have to bust my vampires .50 cal out of storage.
---
Make sure it's not automatic, otherwise only commando will help it
---
are you sure?
---
https://youtu.be/6te-jahIl1o
---
I'm not sure I understand why they'd do this.  I fight the urge to think they sit back and say ' Oops! Too much fun is going on in Watoga.  That'll never do.  Let's fix that right quick. And while we're at it, let's disable weapon and armor mods for a bit just for spite.'
---
Thanks, I can hear it now, and it'll work for now until Bethesda hopefully fixes it
---
Remember, it was a time of change in the region where robots were beginning to encroach into every industry and put people out of work...maybe you've come upon the one industry where human workers couldn't be replaced?
---
Unions should have pushed to legalize and unionize prostitution!
---
In this case maybe prostitution WAS the answer?
---
I mean...before the bombs and ghouls and stuff....now it would just be weird.
---
Dont move this NPC, it would break the V.A.T.S. because of things
---
I got T-51B servo plans and an Instigating Rolling Pin from the Sheepsquatch event I bought into today. 
---
It's a shame the game doesn't have a biscuit recipe in it or my rolling pin would instigate the shit out of it.
---
My issue is I have been getting a metric shit ton of cloaking armor from other Legendary drops.
---
Be happy after about 30 server hops i got only to two events, which failed because people there were one big chaos.
---
Awesome! Thanks for letting me know
---
I'm confirming it. I farmed that place, every single day, for weeks. I always did at least a couple of runs there. And never had more than a couple of runs in a row that were without a legendary enemy.
---
I've done about 2 dozen runs of Watoga since the patch, and have not seen a single legendary enemy.
---
They did something to the legendary spawn rate for those protectrons at least.
---
I haven't done enough farming in other areas to say if the overall rate has changed, but I have found legendary enemies at other locations since the patch, just NONE at Watoga.
---
I haven’t had nearly as bad a time as your describing with Queen fights on Xbox. Virtually every time I show up and start doing serious damage (Heavy Gunner) a couple others will follow suit and we take her down.
---
 As far as low levels running/hiding and the level 100ish players just standing around shooting off a hunting rifle shots every few minutes; that’s been my experience on almost EVERY single Queen Fight since the game started.
---
Now I’ve had a lot more failed Queen attempts the last few weeks, so I can see that getting incredibly frustrating when you’re the one launching the nuke. 
---
Get a group of 4-6 together for the next Queen Fight. Make sure everyone has somewhat of a role  A couple people do damage to her while she is in the air (crippling her is the key to grounding her), a few people crowd control the MOBs on the ground, and the rest split between those two roles and doing the Heavy Damage when she lands. 
---
A good organized Queen fight can be hard to come by. With the experienced folks here on this board I’m sure you can get a solid team going. Good luck!
---
It makes all energy weapons completely inferior though, and it makes my AA gatling laser worthless.
---
Switch your 40 weapons in your stash for the junk, this is exactly why you guys can’t craft anything.
---
Would this perk also help with my explosive shot gun?
---
You mentioned that you've played with your settings extensively, but give this thread a read if you haven't already.

---
Ah ok coolio
---
Had 2 crashes in 48 hours. Hasn't happened like that in weeks. Both on survival *
---
oh my good
---
I only have three weapons in my stash.
---
I can't play without marsupial man. I don't use a jetpack (use emergency protocols instead), so I need something to get me out of those holes when I stumble into one on SBQ and have to run for 10 seconds to find a damn exit to that hidden trench.
---
Umm, they're called sex workers, sweaty.
---
You’re English is better than most in here
---
Basically what another guy in this thread said. Because there are like 60 bots that spawn in the new event. They reduced instanced robot spawns to 0. Otherwise there should be like 8 legendary gutseys during the event. This just so happens to hurt Watoga for us :/
---
my point is I haven't done the quest and the only way I should find out is through the quest, and don't tell me about hints, those are spoilers...
---
For those who downvoted me: Go ahead, follow an unproven 'workaround' at your own risk if you object to being warned. This will totally not get you banned weeks after the fact, as we've seen over and over again in the last months! ;-)
---
3.2k and nothing good out
---
Good point.
---
Then the armor you don’t use
---
I do the easy daily events to farm them for free. IIRC honey beasts drop them frequently too.
---
No it's a probably a  gun that has the explosive legendary perk and also they are hard to get. I reccomend  the trade 76 subreddit to buy then if you have the caps.
---
No armor in my stash.
---
Don’t let some bad experiences ruin the game for you, overall the community is great at least that’s what I’ve seen on PS4. However I do agree with you about the fact that low level players can show up and not help at all. I personally think there should be a level cap for the event so it will keep players out that don’t belong there. 
---
Just yesterday someone launched on the queen and it was myself and a few other level 100+ but everyone else was between 20-55 and didn’t do anything for help, they couldn’t even kill the minions.
---
Endangerol syringer
---
About 1,800.  For a while, there wasn't much in the store that interested me.  It's better now, but since they've made Atoms harder to get, I'm that much more stingy about using them.
---
......that’s not how databases or database searching works
---
Oh totally. Instigating + Executioner's would be fun, Instigating + Executioner's + +250 DR Reload would be obscene.
---
I'm pretty sure what we have is a result of two different solutions combining nonsensically.  First they thought "let's put a vendor from each faction in Whitesprings" then they thought "let's let vendors share the same cap pool".  Both of these were solutions to the problem of people traveling all over the map to make their daily cap allowance.  Either would have worked.  But it doesn't make much sense to do both imo.
---
Has anyone experienced anything in survival mode other than folks in assassin's sentinel ebay sets jumping up and down, one shotting eachother?
---
It a psn issue been like that since yesterday.
---
To get the best damage out of an explosive shotgun you will need the shotgun perks, demolition expert and bloody mess. You could also use adrenaline that will boost your damage for every kill you get up to the max of 36% iirc for the base level card or 64% for rank 5.
---
The TD always appears as 1, since the 3rd patch I think. So you could have found 6, but it'll still only show 1. There is a theory that the number of TD increases the quality of reward when claimed.
---
I'm scanning and repairing my files right now but I've read that thread before, I'll give it another go though since you reminded me of it. Thank you!
---
*laughs in employment* However much I need.
---
Sounds instanced.  Im imagining something like a nuke silo.
---
Yes I believe demo expert works on all explosive weapon except, flamers laser and plasma guns and I believe cryolater,
---
Maybe they should have set up a conference hall to resemble the conference Bethesda hosted for "influencers" at the Greenbrier prior to game release. 
---
They could have had one robot repeating "It just works!" That bot will take your caps but only sell you broken and recycled items...
---
I leveled up 3 times, 2 yesterday night and 1 early this morning, I still had like 1hr left, but it didnt count 😔
---
Start by setting the graphical options to the medium preset
---
Then close the game and go to C:\Users\YouruserName\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76
---
Find the  Fallout76Prefs.ini and open it with notepad.
---
Find and try changing the following lines so they look like this (change the 1s to 0s and vice-versa):
---
bFull Screen=1
---
bBorderless=0
---
iPresentInterval=0
---
Save the file and try the game. It will probably run a bit better.
---
 If you want to go even further, find the sAntiAliasing=TAA setting and change it to sAntiAliasing=FXAA.
---
Come back if you need more help or have more questions
---
I mean, moderating a subreddit isn't really a job.
---
Let the nice man spend his money dammit !
---
This is super helpful thank you so much.
---
“Pray for atom” that sounds familiar....
---
If you think running conduit is a pain, try working with pylons!
---
About 1400.  Saving them in anticipation of the Raven skin coming back, and hopefully not waiting in vain.
---
It's a good general purpose weapon when you can keep enemies at a distance. Punchy, accurate and plenty of free ammo around. The damage per clip isn't great though, so you should add a good handmade for emergency situations and beating down landed scorchbeasts.
---
It doesn't take damage when it's cloaked. Whatever you think you're doing, you're not doing.
---
If you don't have the time to mod, then don't commit to modding a subreddit.  People expecting you to do a job you volunteered for is completely reasonable.
---
You can't pause the game, nor is it particularly easy to rejoin the same server if you leave unless you have a friend that is already there.  It's not going to be ideal to leave it running while doing something else.
---
"Rejoice, o young man in thy youth."
---
Sold. Please DM me your PS ID.
---
I got a 3* legendary Mr. Gutsy yesterday while doing a run. Only one I found in several runs.
---
OK it seems solved for me now but maybe it has been an issue with lot of psn ID changing
---
Ran Watoga 4 times in 2 days.  Still legendaries.  Got 3 star and it dropped 3 star armor. And the usual 1 star crap.  The issue.. as always is when low levels show up...  they spawn lower level enemies.  You also must do the entire run and not cherry pick the homes and or the golf club... Level up folks. 
---
I will say running without power armor you take a lot more damage.. nice surprise. My TSE with full perks still crushes em.  But melee In close combat... bring stems
---
1. I'd say half and half. They keep nerfing things and making it grindier which is a lot of the complaints I hear. They have also buffed some stuff. Overall, with the patches things have gotten a bit better, but then they go and break major things like crafting weapons, the way you horn your stash etc. Overall, if hit area Fallout fan, definitely give this a try.
---
2900, didnt like much to change the cosmetics beside some PA or Apparel skin.
---
The game spoiled itself to me... after accepting the new quest I noticed a nearby Event on the map I've never seen before. So, of course I joined and it turned out to be the final encounter with you-know-what. But at this point I had no idea that the fight would actually be the conclusion to the entire quest chain - which I've just started. I've killed the final boss and wasn't even aware of it.
---
Yeah I have only ever ran into the "server is full" error when joining a friend who's been playing for a while.
---
I would think if anyone wants to allow you guys to buy atoms, Bethesda would be at the top of the list. It’s in their best interest to monetize the entire playerbase. I can’t believe it’s that they don’t care or are not aware. It has to be a currency issue or something.
---
What’s the point of this post if people who say they’ve seen a legendary just get downvoted. I’ve seen speculation on this too but that’s all it is, speculation. And saying the new event will stop legendary robots from spawning all together just sounds ridiculous and has no proof at all.
---
The bug was that when they made it so mods didn't scrap as needed for the components bulk items in your stash couldn't be used automatically.  They changed it so that bulk items scrap automatically so that it could be used in the stash as a quick and dirty fix.  
---
Bulk items were functioning correctly before they made it so that mods didn't scrap for the components.  That's what they need to sort out.
---
Wrong he even specifically mention zenimax studios helping. You may want to go rewatch the video.
---
SERIOUSLY this is necessary. Every other flipping pc game ever has this feature.
---
My guess would be the light machine gun also known as MG42
---
I'm not sure why you guys haven't handed over moderation to other people at this point.
---
Lots of the mods here are just mods because they're also mods from /r/Fallout and also mods in the Fallout discord. The fallout subreddit and discord are toxic as fuck and love circlejerking against this game. 
---
They clearly don't give a shit about it, I've barely ever seen any other mods aside from you here. Why are they even mods?
---
Should probably require rare materials, or be part of the Legendary Vendor stuff.  But yes, I'd love to be able to upgrade a few of these legendaries I have.
---
It'll probably be 3500 by this weekend. I keep running into supermutants with miniguns.
---
For the plans? At least that's the only thing that makes sense with the shared pool.
---
Yeah, I'm holding on to a fair number of junky 3* Legendaries for that vendor.  Honestly, I'm not even sure it makes sense now, since I'm bound to collect more in the next month anyway.
---
And where was that, exactly? I'm not going to rewatch a long ass video for something I'm pretty fucking sure I'm remembering correctly.
---
If I was feeling more adventurous I’d put that theory to the test with my 30 I’ve been saving lol.
---
Every time I spawn with more than one in my inventory. There’s always one laying on the ground when I respawn into another server. Weird right?
---
some of the best game friends I have are other skilled players who didn’t get demolished. I have respect for other good players and that tends to go both ways. *then* *you* *team* *up* *and* *kill* *everyone*
---
Ok I see ur point, but I just don’t have it! Zero! And for last time I had no data so I could get one at least!
---
What version do you play on?
---
I have. Power pylons. Also support poles won't hold a roof. You have to use walls then replace one panel at a time with poles.
---
Poor guy wants the ability to waste money.
---
It isn't level up 3 times, it is level up while fulfilling three criteria.
---
I am guessing to many people don't realize that the stock is camo when it should be wood.
---
....and so it begins.
---
Around 4k, I mainly wait for the good stuff, still waiting on Blackbird's return as well. Buying more isn't a foreign concept to me, either.
---
Imagine being as insecure as this guy.
---
about 4K.  I'm waiting to spend them on something I really want.  That or I'll wait for the things I sort of like but, think are too expensive to go on sale then I'll spend them.
---
I was checking to see if Butcher's Bounty would help with this quest. I too have failed it too many times. I usually end up arriving with 6 minutes or less. I am going to sit on the spot and wait to see if it is a 30 minute quest.
---
3 crashes in an hour for me. Fingers crossed I'm good for now.
---
A high rate-of-fire gun with the Vampire Legendary effect and a large ammunition clip will get your through most of the fight. 
---
I use a Vampire’s Minigun and after I become a conduit I just lay into the Black Sheep and I never get below 80% health. 
---
Using this strategy I have not failed a single Cryptid Event.. as long as I can be there at the start. Anytime I’ve joined a Crytipid event  that’s partially completed I’ve had a 50\50 failure chance due to people not figuring out the Event mechanics quick enough.
---
I already server hop to try and get the best spread of levels I can. I’m just unlucky in which ones actually decide to join. I’ll try including the drop site next time and see if that helps but I’m going to make a post asking if people want to join before I launch to cut out as much chance as possible. The only reason I haven’t done that up this point is because I’m normally pretty patient and most people seem to have good fortune with Queen kills. I kept telling myself “This time decent people will join, they have to”. But my patience is basically out with the event at this point lol.
---
I put 3 points into END.
---
One for Aquaboy/girl.
---
And two for Sun Kissed 2 (removes radiation during daytime hours).
---
i also got a rolling pin on a subsequent try. that's a real punch in the nuggets.
---
I believe it
---
That would be really cool! You could but a flagpole on top of your house.
---
It was an electricity joke about the new event.
---
One of his recent fallout 4 morality videos right before fo76 came out.
---
i have it at level 3. maybe it must be level 1? would be dumb as hell but maybe this is the problem. i mean when you get a weapon modifier to 20% you only get that 20% and not 10%+15%+20%. hope you understand what i mean
---
Good job! Still remember my first time finding one haha
---
It stays there after a nuke. I think for an hour?
---
Don’t buy atoms. All of you participating in micro transactions are ruining video games.
---
No worries.
---
I’ll be sure to try and do this. Randoms just aren’t cutting it lol. Thanks for the advice
---
got a link to it? I don't remember watching that one, and if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
---
that has been an issue since beta.
---
Crap. Your first answer gave me hope, the next 2 answers killed it for me. I appreciate your honesty.
---
lol you realize japanese has an alphabet why are you using romanji
---
Nah lvl 3 should work fine, apperently alot of ppl had issues with mod boxes since patch. Maybe they fixed it in todays hotfix?
---
Was the repair screen glitch fixed?
---
I rather they delay stuff than releasing it broken
---
Do they give an advantage? Yes. Any advantage, no matter how small, isn't cool to involve in microtransactions.
---
On the day of your 15th level, your balls shall descend, thus granting the ability to attach armor pieces, my dude.
---
Your still hidden if you don’t kill anyone. I got into a fresh server last night and all 10 of us had no kills so no one was one the map for a solid 30 min
---
"Its mines"
---
The current PC doesn't allow you to swap SPECIAL points either. It's still a pretty powerful mechanic. It removes the concept of specializations. I have to make fewer decisions when I'm out and about. With a high Strength and Agility you now a master with every weapon except rifles. The purpose of the setup seems to be for specialization, not to be good at everything anytime.
---
I agree loadouts would be a good thing for consoles to have access to but, again, there needs to be a limit to it, like fast travel. Either CAMP and Workshop only, not while enemies are near, or on a timer (either limiting use between or X seconds to take effect).
---
Used to happen to me all the time. The other day it was a bracelet from that missing kid quest.
---
It's an Event, so you have to wait for it to start. Like many Events, usually someone has to enter the area for a chance to trigger it.
---
lol I don't want to. They're mostly of my first camp. lol
---
The new excavator power armor skin is cool
---
Everything saves automatically so you can always pick up where you left off though.
---
I like to grab my trusty hammer, excavator PA and go beat the shit out of everything at West Tek, Huntersville and the Top of the World. And then sell it all to the vendor bot at Pleasant Valley Station. It's fun for me and I can usually finish up in 30 minutes or so.
---
I’m happy and have played solo for my entire 750+ hours, you cannot pause it but you can fast travel back to your camp, shut yourself inside and be AFK for about 30 mins I think before being kicked for inactivity, but there is no way to stop the action instantly. If the worst happened and you died because you had to put down the controller the only thing you loose is your collected junk which you can go back and retrieve when you respawn. Id say if you already own it and have it installed then dive in and see what you think
---
Lol wow calm down there kid, it was a joke. Damn lol. Who's a massive child?
---
My workshop I claimed had an event to take it back come up and it said it was overrun with sheepsquatch in the quest description. Fast traveled there and it changed to huge gulpers.
---
According to Wikipedia, about 7,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. And I spend a few and gain a few all the time.
---
I bought 10,000 to help support the game.  Didn't have anything in particular in mind.  I've bought random stuff, have about 5,000 left.
---
This is so cool. This is the sort of stuff I dreamed about when Fallout 76 was first announced.
---
verb (used with object), blood·ied, blood·y·ing.
---
to stain or smear with blood.
---
to cause to bleed, as by a blow oraccident:to bloody someone's nose.
---
adverb
---
Slang . (used as an intensifier):bloody awful; bloody wonderful.
---
The Burrow is under Harper's Ferry.
---
I tell myself everyday “ok I’ll play for 1 hr....1hr.....1hr”
---
I’ve been at Arktos Pharma for almost 3 hrs! Collecting stuff, reading posters, exploring there’s just so much to do. Also getting attacked while taking pictures (that’s always fun) and finding wild mongrels in restroom stalls (how’d it get in there?) 
---
Anyway that’s enough from me.
---
Oh, you are correct it was my error in grammar. I write casual so it loses the inflection in my voice. Sorry for that. But nevertheless, I do support your hatred of back door campers. I've artillery striked a few when they've stolen my legendary kills. Good day to you :-)
---
Yeah my first thought was "oh not another delay" then thought "well, better a short delay than a buggy release"
---
Y'all really think that this is a well thought-out decision on Beth's part? They have to do this because they're most likely hemorrhaging money out their cavernous booty hole.
---
Just like you I'm not going to go back and give this scumbag more views than I already did in the past before I found out what a shit human he is.
---
It is right around the "is it moral to leave synth sean" he put like 2 or 3 morality videos out at the time so I don't remember exactly which one of the 3 it is as his morality videos, sorry. 
---
I don't remember exactly which of the 3 it is though, and he may have deleted it recently since this has blown up in his face(he has a tendancy to just silentely delete things that show what a horrible person he is.) and I'm not going to rewatch 3 long ass videos for something I'm 100% sure I'm remembering correctly.
---
Im gonna put this in my post now as further proof :)
---
Each “puff” counts as a projectile.
---
Upvote for awareness; may your struggle yield results!
---
Oh my sweet Jebus, **this**. 
---
You are better than half on the people I have met in my life, having lived in the U.S. the whole time. 
---
If any of my daily customers tried even *half* as hard to compose their sentences like this person did, my life wold be so much easier.
---
Maybe its just super rare like the fasnaught masks
---
thank you for the fast response. i just tested it but didnt work. same problem as yesterday.
---
Got a legendary there last night, and it didn't explode.
---
Sorry no I have no respect for someone who has to form fucking alliances with other people so he can steamroll solo players before he feels safe playing the game.
---
Move them to another folder
---
I'm not contradicting myself. I'm making speculation, but I'm also labeling it as speculation. You, on the other hand are talking about speculation as if it were definite(at least occasionally). I'm not saying don't speculate, I'm saying you need to not talk about speculation like it's a sure or absolute thing, **like you were doing.**
---
Why bother becoming a mod if you're not gonna do shit
---
No, I'm talking about this map:  [https://imgur.com/a/bBBRRyv](https://imgur.com/a/bBBRRyv) .
---
The dots are connected to some of those places.
---
Ahhh, the memories :)
---
Welcooomme....to-ooo the ma-chine.
---
10, but I had around 3500 a few days ago. Vault bundles and the Bone PA set me back lol
---
I still think they need to allow cross console support for this game to be truly great and/or a way to transfer data.
---
I wonder if that's how you can get the Keg, as well?
---
Welcome to West Virginia.
---
omg this is the greatest fallout post ever
---
Claim thunder mountain - yeah ok its not gonna take me a week to fast travel there, hit claim, wait 30 seconds for it to claim and boom, 30 atoms, now wait 6 days 15 hours to get the next one
---
that’s ok you don’t have to be sorry but thanks for apologizing
---
We're about to have the legendary vendor. We'll but buying our endgame loot with tokens from scrapping junk legendaries. It'll be about collecting tokens not waiting for these massive RNG loot tables to suck so much less.
---
I played that mode it’s really fun
---
This screenshot is everything I need from life! Congrats on the armour. :)
---
Not that I have seen unless it was added with sheepsquatch patch. The Biv stuff has been the same since it was added a few weeks ago. *shrug*
---
If they did something like seasons that Diablo has and offers rewards for completing certain things i think that would be even better.
---
&gt;It removes the concept of specializations. 
---
It does no such thing.  You still have to have the Special points to equip the loadouts.  All Perk Loadout Manager does is reduce the amount time spent clicking through F076's 1990's interface.  They already give us the ability to change perk cards.  The mod just enables you to spend less time fussing with menus and more time playing the actual game.
---
Both 2 and 3 aren’t really the case, although they aren’t wrong. 
---
You absolutely do not need a team or group to complete end game activities. People flock to the end game boss event, negating the need for an organized team.
---
Although there isn’t a pause, leaving the server doesn’t impact your progress and is basically a pseudo pause. It’s also relatively casual so you can play at your own pace.
---
More than I need at the moment, but I'm cheap....the item I want hasn't gone on sale yet.
---
Alright, well I'll make sure to start hitting up Biv's daily quest, thanks!
---
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
---
They already are defending it. Already been told several times that I'm over reacting about the repair kits.
---
I think it's more about connection with the server. Server ability to send data to you plus your ability to receive date (download speed)
---
4,150 so far, only from doing challenges, I've bought the scarlet sniper outfit, bomber jacket when it was on sale, and the raider excavator skin. I'm waiting to buy the nuka shine x01 skin
---
Having the same freezing issues it's very annoying
---
This would be excellent! Otherwise, I have no idea how I'll manage my photos. I have so many of fun times at different places with friends, I'm already having trouble deleting things to make room for challenge photos. 
---
(Yes, I know you can screen grab them and save externally, but it's nice seeing different adventures on loading screens!)
---
Those places are marked in the map we saw in the Wild Appalachia trailer ([https://imgur.com/a/bBBRRyv](https://imgur.com/a/bBBRRyv)), and it's the same map that we see in the new Sheepsquatch quest, inside Calvin's office, but that one it's a bit different. Some dots and marks have been removed, I don't know why.
---
Lets upvote this Xbox players. Hopefully a fix soon?
---
That is a server limitation. It didn’t start until patch 7 or so but yeah man, it seems almost universal that the camp takes forever.
---
The problem is this event have a hidden 3 hours cool down and will organized team can finish it in about 2 minutes it's most likely why you can't find it.
---
It's more of people actually role playing apocalyptic environment that allows raiders, but not discount PUBG.
---
Go to the logging camp just east of the sons of dane compound, youll get a [shit ton of wood](https://youtu.be/19-4-o89BVA)
---
This. I accidentally somehow bought the excavator armor a few weeks ago and was like "Welp, looks like I'm buying some atoms".
---
Then the datamines came out tuesday and i go "Welp, I'm gonna be buying a shit ton of atoms"
---
Try server hopping until you find a group of higher levels in Fissure Prime
---
 What city I've been trying to pull up on dude for years?
---
I tried what you said and it worked really well the ash heap, I was able to maintain a about 80-90 frames with the occasional stutter and freeze but I can't complete the questline because the top of the world breaks my game and a few other places as well. I think I just give up though, I'm probably going to try for a refund or something, its really disappointing because the game was more than playable on my Xbox One S but not my PC which has better performance across the board on all games except for this one.
---
Never thought of that, seasons synergizes well with the speedrunning concept. I see so many people complain of end game content but speenrunning always adds new challenges to any old game.  
---
I think the devs have confirmed seasons so we should expect them soon. Fast leveling will be key. Unfortunately for my play style, I think it will be teams that will level fastest. Still would like to see lone wanderer lvl 50 speed runs. I am mainly interested in the most efficient methods, routes, strats, etc.
---
Why people use bloody mess, wont it only apply when you kill something? So it would basically be useless for PvP in Survival? If you don't mind, could you answer me how can i fill up the power on my Fusion Cores, when i found one it is almost all depleted.
---
Of course it's possible. I hope they make it better quality of life for us all. 
---
I would like my keybinds to stay in build mode too ...I know it can be coded too.
---
At least give us the option to find “plant plans”
---
nope...zero builds, you must use PA...I'd not come back.
---
Everything is viable, you don't have to just stick to meta gaming.
---
I'll add you :)
---
I've mostly just been farming for the new dungeon, moving my house, and making problems for myself by collecting too much ore with the Excavator.
---
Be ready for the new dailies and weekly of taking 1000 photos x day in absurd placea,wearing a tapestry,on low health,with a deathclaw.
---
You should mention what platform you are on, what type of Armor you are trading (Combat/Marine etc), and whether the Armor your trading/looking for is Light/Sturdy/Heavy Armor.
---
Otherwise I happen to have a 3 Star Marine Armor Leg (only comes in sturdy), that is Chameleon/Sentinel/I forgot and need to check the 3rd star.
---
ok there's the confusion. I never mentioned Oxhorn and thought you were referring to official Bethesda videos. I personally enjoy watching Oxhorn's lore videos and try to ignore things involving his personal life because if you dig into anyone's real life, you'll find things you don't like regardless of who it is. On top of that, some people I've seen have moved from "he's homophobic" to "he said he's against pornography but uses CBBE" which I find damages their argument severely. I'll look through the Institute morality videos to see if I can find what you're referring to, but keep in mind that Oxhorn's been wrong about things like that in the past.
---
You still have that sense of danger, you just won't get 400+ caps from one kill. And I'm sure you don't waste a lot of ammo on people, fairly easy to one shot on here.
---
Best builds are bloodied. Melee and stealth can do fine but nowhere near bloodied.
---
Okay, I'll check it out
---
There’s a bunch of misc mods (not the material mods) that flat out won’t attach and haven’t since the game launched. There’s a different bug new with patch 8 that’s fucking up mod attachment in general. 
---
Shadowed/Polymer/Ultralight should work when they fix the patch 8 bug, though. I have them on my Forest and Urban armors.
---
Yea I was thinking  it was an hour! 3!? That’s going to be a hard time to find indeed. Can you trigger it solo or do you have to be on a team. I read an article that said you had to be in a group but wasn’t sure.
---
Omg yes its especially bad if you have marsupial
---
Oh, I never checked, I'll take a look! Thanks
---
Aren't you the guy who was starting a plan store?
---
Bloodied builds are leagues above anything else as far as pure DPS is concerned. Power armor/Hazmat suits are still required for nuke zones, but since pretty much everybody knows where to drop them for queen fights, there's not really any need to ever actually go into one. As far as PvP, pick up an assassin's sentinel set off of ebay if you want to be even remotely competitive.   
---
That's really about it, from my perspective. I honestly have no idea what other builds people are running if they're not a bloodied glass cannon.
---
Ah yes, the giant hole! Thanks I'll check it out!
---
Last time you guys got ATOM in Japan it destroyed two cities
---
You paid for your car once, guess there's no need to keep paying for gas to keep it running, right?   
---
OK. So you get the game exactly as it exists at release. No patches, no server support, no free content, no new quests, no DLCs, nothing. Because hey, that's what you paid for, right? What you're saying is that you don't think developers deserve to be paid for their time.
---
I am assuming that was for OP, yeah? 
---
I was saying that my Japanese isnt that good, but those that work hard like OP inspire me to practice/study more.
---
Ok thanks! I hadn’t read the known issues thread.. just the patch notes.
---
So, no proof?
---
A huge issue with adventure mode for a lot of people is the that you don't really even need to worry about dying. So this is definitely a step in the right direction.
---
Except that photos are stored client side and no one except you could see them.
---
Yes, they could allow uploading of pics to their servers, but on PC photos are saved to an easy to access folder and users could copy any kind images into them.
---
If you say they could code a sort of filter that would only upload files saved from the game, i'm sure someone would find a way to trick that filter into thinking a file came from the game.
---
You can do it solo you just need a card, plus make sure there are high lvl players on your map unless you have op build for pve
---
Ah thanks! I have seen that I just forgot. Well that blows that whole idea out of the water lol
---
I read that you encounter the real sheepsquatch in one of the sidequests.
---
Melee and Power Armor were never the best btw. Just took time for people to figure the game out. Every practical build is viable. There are a few popular options atm, but most people seemingly are just winging it.
---
When you look in the challenges for the game, specifically the cryptids killer challenge the sheepsquatch has been added to the list.
---
There’s a new stair case?
---
Nope. Just keep hopping. My crew did half a dozen of them last night.
---
Have you [opened a support ticket](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10) for this issue? I submitted a detailed bug report with steps leading to the bug months ago, but it seems it still hasn't been fixed.
---
For those not aware, the bug occurs at the end of the "Initiate of Mysteries" quest, after completing the "Log in to claim your promotion" objective. Back at the Cryptos terminal login screen, when trying to proceed, the terminal screen will no longer update (but you'll hear the typical typing sounds). From [what I've read elsewhere](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Initiate_of_Mysteries#Bugs), you're supposed to keep spamming the use/interact key/button to blindly proceed and trigger the next step of the quest. However, if you don't do this, and try quitting to (the game's) main menu instead, the quest will become permanently bugged.
---
Very risky, it works but not always. Never do anything you can't afford to lose like legendary weapons, rather find a friend you can absolutely trust, that's the safest way. Friend lost a bunch weapons .. I have 2 xboxes, 2 characters, for a small price, you can probably have two characters, this is the safest if you don't want bother anyone and are invested in the game.
---
We must help our Japanese brethren for they have given the community so much such as big titty anime waifus.
---
14k all free. i may be the reason the dailies are getting harder... I bought about 2500 worth of stuff and spent 800 by mistake on leather armor skin.
---
Please stop spreading false information. The repair kits in the atom shop are not random drops
---
Yer ponderings about us down here be about spot on from over yonder stranger. I often have a hard time communicating with rather proper english speakers,
---
I just plug in  a double ended 3.5mm audio  cable. Bonus is it keeps the cat off my lap 👍🐱
---
Lol. It was a good idea. I'm guessing both the Ash Heap and Toxic Valley will have more content to come, since both places are kind of lacking at the moment.
---
Just wait for the purveyor and if that doesn't meet our needs, repost this
---
Funny. Just this week I and a friend both looted multiple 1* Medics Black Powder pistols a few days in a row off random Legendaries and also thought it was a strange occurrence.
---
I've recently got back into it aswell, I was running PA and melee aswell, but since I got back into it, I'm trying to swap over to auto rifles and PA, then possibly swap out the PA for Marine armor or trappers once I get more mods for them.
---
Tons of things to do now
---
Sounds like a lot of work. Grudge?
---
*Adds Item to C.A.M.P. that is a picture frame that instead of changing the whole picture/frame...it cycles through your current photo gallery
---
BUT it could only display picture that you currently have, if you delete a picture it would remove the frame
---
Ok, thank you!
---
Was fun
---
No. Just no. This is how we throw the economy down the drains in a week. Even further. People will just hyper farm and take heavy advantages of this.
---
Awesome idea! Always wanted to "watch" a fight without getting beat up myself. Once my low level self tried to watch 2 high level teams fight over a workshop, then someone thought I was part of it &amp; tried to kill me but pacifist mode saved me. I'm gonna be THAT person &amp; say we need a popcorn emote. Can't make it tonight but I'd love to see the next one!!
---
That will actually give me a reason to collect junk and ability to choose item will greatly increase odds of getting something useful. I will craft handmade and i will get handmade not the rolling pin 😅
---
I didn't see any legendary yesterday in 5 runs
---
Ok?
---
Heck, why not add a random legendary in that quest. More people would run it.
---
They should remove the Leaderboards all together.
---
Sheepsquatch has its textures in the code, its featured in the trailer, it's in the cryptid killer list and is part of workshop invasion quests, how is that not proof, I can't post a picture but if you watch the trailer you see it and if you type in sheepsquatch on the search bar there is a post showing what sheepsquatch looks like in game
---
Lol. Those are the exact words I would use for what you are doing.
---
I'm sending thoughts and prayers right achoo for a second chance.
---
Pretty sure it's too late then, can they make the character restart that if I ask them to?
---
Why do you feel the need to stroke your EPeen and what do you expect to gain from it?
---
On a scale of 1 - 10 how cool is the unreleased stuff? I can't find pictures. XD
---
Cheers man, you're doing mothmans work
---
I could be way off, but that description sounds like what my legacy TSE Flamer does when I shoot it. 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Ya I bet. Lol
---
Why are you upset
---
For lead, grab your excavator suit and head to Lucky Hole mine. If you hit even half of the ore nodes in there, you'll have more lead than you know what to do with. Your new problem will be finding enough acid to turn it all into lead scrap.   
---
Screws I can't really help you with, aside from advising you to tag them for search. I don't really remember if I ever actively farmed screws or not, but I haven't thought about it in a long time since I've got alts carrying a few thousand of them.
---
Been in the shop since Tuesday! It isn’t advertised though. 500 atoms.
---
Yes, they look very nice!
---
They *literally* said that all games from 2018 and onward will have 0 issues. This post is completely pointless.
---
But, uh, okay. Thanks.
---
Too late for me, honestly. I deleted the game after this patch, and (even though I didn't preorder FO76) I will likely not preorder a Bethesda game again.
---
I haven't really had much trouble with it once I learned the basic properties. I have a couple real complaints.
---
1: through wall connectors are a wire stub, which is stupid. I want to run conduit through walls, not wire a room from the fidgety through wall connector with ugly wires.
---
2: straightening conduit is a nightmare. If it's not just so from the beginning, it's crooked everywhere. I'm a tradesman, and this gives me freaking hives lol. I'd love to be able to pick up an entire conduit assembly to make small adjustments.
---
As for your issues,
---
1: the conduits snap on top of panels, like it's an exterior conduit for roofs. You can snap them to the vertical conduit pieces to get a ceiling mount.
---
2: I haven't encountered the wall issue you're having. There's a very specific depth to install them, so I typically  start building out from the pass-through wall connector 
---
3: the parts are some correct ratio to the floor panels. I've had to swap some combinations to get the right length, but I always do. The connect components idea is actually pretty great, but I'd imagine the implementation would be a wreck.
---
Hold on, the camera isnt out yet? someone snapped a picture of me just today
---
A nuke would destroy his crops, are you sure it was a players camp XD
---
Should have taken his words into consideration when releasing the game...
---
Nuka cola grenade* sorry
---
Builds to do what? One hit everything at level 20? Or dominate in pvp?
---
I use a not very original sneaky sniper build with rifles, I'm level 38, I generally stay in areas appropriate for that level, and I almost never die. I just use the perks meant to help that build, non-legendary rifles (although I would if I had one), and no mutations. I don't really do any power leveling. I just play the game. However, I do wait to do harder quests and such until I know my level is ready for it, meaning I haven't tried battling my way through Watoga yet and I don't go taking on the SBQ. It's been fun.
---
Adrenaline only goes up to 60%
---
I sure hope so! I actually enjoyed roaming around the Ash Heap as I haven’t even fully explored it yet. I had never been to some of the towns and points we went to for the quest. And I found a couple of Black Titanium nodes I didn’t know about previously. It got me excited about the area again and I’m definitely going to be doing more exploring.
---
It used to work like that until a few patches ago. I hope Bethesda fixes that oversight.
---
Way less impressive
---
1. The negativity made me hesitate, but I decided to ignore it and jump in.  Not without its quirks, but glad I made the leap.  I'm enjoying it.
---
2. Some things are easier as part of a team, but no, I dont think you /have/ to be on a team, especailly at higher levels.   I'm not there yet, so I could be wrong.
---
3. No.  Unlike previous fallouts, there is not a save option (its automatic), opening pipboy, or going to the map does not stop/pause time.  
---
Best bet is to log off.   This is both good and bad - 
---
At relog, you are restored near wherever you were, but not in the exact same spot (so if you are in the basement of a house when you log off, you will come back on the street outside the house. )
---
The upside is it is great for XP and leveling, as the enemies in the house will respawn, so you'll get to kill them all again. 
---
(often called server hopping)
---
If you go this route you can avoid being kicked by entering photo mode and putting a rubber band around the  two thumb knobs to constantly pan the camera lens.
---
Yea, was easier and still fun though. At least I get to keep my caps
---
Low health with adrenal mutation plus nerd rage
---
That’s 4% of people who bought the game. I know a lot of people that bought the game and made it to level 5 and never played it against.
---
The 4% is a completely inaccurate way to gauge who’s into PvP and who is not, a better way to look at it would be to cross reference the % of people that have achieved level 50 and of those people, see how many have completed the good grief trophy, but that’s not possible with PSN.
---
Did not help at all. Still the same lag/stutter/screen freezing.
---
Bloody mess gives you a 15% more damage with any weapon. as for fusion cores take control of one of the power plant workshops and use the fusion core generator to make fusion cores. you can either complete the powering up event to power it or build a fusion generator to power it and then it will produce 8 fully charged core per hour.
---
Boo
---
I mean Wal Mart has a better return policy than pretty much anywhere.
---
Yes please!
---
Same i was stocking up on 3stars and other stuff for that vendor and player vending. Now my inventory is a total cluster and i know deep down that vendor will just hand out 3 star rolling pins and boxing gloves.
---
The level of petty in this I love it
---
ah 60% my bad i knew it was somewhere between 60 and 64. thank you.
---
My guess is they probably don't have the tools to do so, but I'm hoping Bethesda will eventually fix the issue if more people report it. I plan on opening a new support ticket for it referencing my old bug report.
---
I don't care about losing junk myself. I'm smart enough to stash mine. This is referring to the randoms in the event.
---
You can have my workshop impister hoard... Just take it
---
I hope it's also not incredibly more difficult than the silo because I want to do it alone and the silo was doable alone. The Sheepsquatch quest for example put me off because it was not at all doable alone.
---
Not upset at all. It's a perfectly cromulent question.
---
Well then.
---
You just have to eat only vegans.
---
1* nocturnal rolling pins and auto-stim wood armor, coming right up!
---
Which ones? You're not being clear. You haven't been clear at any point during this conversation. You need to learn how to communicate before you can argue semantics. You've been failing spectacularly partially because you've been misunderstanding some of what I've said and partially because you've misrepresented yourself. Get your shit together, then come back with something coherent.
---
That’s where you’re wrong, I specifically said camera. If they changed the way it worked with the camera it could send one copy to the folder and another to the servers, or possibly make it send a request for camera photos anyway they choose to make it really.
---
It will actually give you only around 10% dmg at max rank because it applies only to explosive part of weapon dmg (what is 20% of base dmg after February nerf, it used to be 100% before)
---
Wondering if Bethesda fucked something up. I’ve seen a few posts about people not seeing or receiving legendaries in Watoga.
---
Hight level players are not ticket to win. In 2 hours of serverhopping i get to two events and both of then failed, because people didn't know what is happening.
---
How are shotguns?
---
Honestly I’d like seeing the 4-5 stars appear through unique rolls. That would keep them within balance and not just completely make 3 stars worthless. They definently could  balance it a certain way making it more for certain play styles. Like the Fixer being the only gun (I believe) with increased sneak speed. Stuff like that would be really cool
---
Sorry to be that one person but it really triggers my OCD
---
Nothing new they show up every now and then
---
Exactly. I do have random up to 30s long freezing. I’m on PS4, if I’m correct, people having this issue have 1 thing in common: high number of PSN friends. Is this the same with you?
---
Alternative take: Sheepsquatch hordes that end up not being sheepsquatches is part of the joke
---
Ah okay, was my first time encountering this so I thought it was to do with the circle on the map :/
---
1080atoms, so from beta to now i had 12000+-.
---
Yea that wouldve been nice.
---
That's actually a good idea!
---
This sub is terrible when it comes to these topics. As if they don't wanna acknowledge it.
---
20 real life hours
---
Or it's in the dungeon they're adding next week
---
[I'd say 10](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bb9h79/datamined_new_atomic_shop_items_0904_patch_1127/)
---
I'll definitely be buying the nuka shine power armor, brewing station skin, and barrels. Also, the wood grain skin for the camera.
---
Also considering the skull mask and doomsday clock.
---
I know it just higher chance with high lvl players 60+ then low lvls 45 or lower
---
I have around 300-400. However I have the same issue on my 2nd account with like 20 friends on that account. Happening on PC too. Not to mention the in game friends list is still messed up
---
You bought the game again to escape a 300 cap bounty? Damn that’s commitment
---
Lead is pretty easy. Just tag it in your search. Pencils, paint, toys (lol), weight lifting metal, etc.
---
For acid I try to find the little nodes and set up camp, but I think a few workshops have it like the golf course near grafton.
---
Screws are pretty rare, seems like toys, typewriters,  etc have those. Again just tag them in a search so you know what items have them. Or just go on the trade subs and buy them.
---
This is a bare fist fight right?
---
He's just trying to embiggen himself.  Let him have this one.
---
Throw on some of that settlement radio music from Fo4 and you have a deal.
---
That's a very good point, would be the perfect time to add in new enemies
---
It's all good.
---
I like it
---
Fair, but they could also help by limiting the number of photos a camp could display this way. That would prevent someone from loading their camp down with 1000 pictures that all need to be loaded when you enter the display range of the camp.
---
Yeah and I’m getting downvotes too, it’s the rules of the sub and a ton of people are already complaining about this. It’s common courtesy.
---
Do the math on materials for high level items. You’d have to farm the shit out of resources to even have a shot a getting a legendary, odds are you get a legendary like exterminator which nobody wants, which would make it a huge resource drain to spam crafting. You sell that shitty item to a vendor, get a few caps, but still not recouping losses for it unless you choose to be a craftsman/scavver instead of combat. 
---
There’s at least 10-15 legendary enhancements. That means you’ve got at best a 1:1000 chance of getting a good single legendary, which drops way farther if you go for three star legendaries. At worst, you’ve got a market flooded with high level armor options, which isn’t really a bad thing for some players.
---
Do the math yourself, it’s not gonna be a huge advantage, it’s basically a long shot bonus.
---
Or possibly add a feature like CSGO with sprays and custom sprays where you could choose one or two pics to upload from your gallery into your camp specifically for that use?
---
Thanks for your answer!
---
Honestly super high damage in almost any situation. Obviously not from far away
---
I disagree with Step 3.  Survival mode is survival mode - no need for player-created PvP-free areas.
---
Nah far harbor suit looked like a bulky Hazmat suit. This one looks fully armored.
---
Farm Yoa Gui Acid and Springs galore
---
But as my question stated, can I build them as the 2 square staircase with platforms or just as the standalone staircase?
---
Zing! Lol
---
Weirdly I'm super excited for the clock of all things! Thank you for the link, you have me exited for the new stuff! :D
---
They said Scorchbeast Queens will have a chance at dropping them.
---
They are very good. Possibly the best weapon option for farming/grinding. Explosive and Staggering shotguns are popular.
---
I did an event this morning and was joined by another player. As soon as it was concluded, the jackwagon whipped out his war drum and one shotted me
---
Especially if you are only interested in pve. Lots of quality builds out there.
---
Not everyone on the roof is a vulture. I'm referring to the the players that I have seen with my own eyes dart like a bird to grab junk of multiple players and then rush back on the roof to watch more people fall without ever firing a shot during the event.
---
I am totally 100% not trying to be rude, and I often feel the need for those resources myself, but did you do a search here for "screws" and/or "lead?" This literally gets asked every other day and there's lots of good advice on here, but you'll get a lot more of it if you look at the long list of answers already given.
---
No problem glad i could help :)
---
When I started looking for lead and I found out that most toys had lead in them, I thought it was pretty funny/ironic lol
---
I felt like the events in the mire got more hard aswell
---
What economy?
---
You guys talk about economy and there really isn't one.
---
Do the Caps we spend become available for others?
---
No.....
---
The only real economy are rare legendaries weapons.
---
I know this is an unpopular thought process..
---
But until the Caps we spend create a banking system that all players can dip into.... 
---
The idea of this game having an economy is a joke.
---
Nah, it is the diving suit, compare the sides of the one in the posts link, and the link I sent here, they look identical
---
 [https://www.google.com/search?q=fallout+4+far+harbour+diver+suit&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF\_en-GBGB820GB820&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJoazC2cjhAhUuQhUIHcRsCSQQ\_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1858&amp;bih=977#imgrc=eOOFIbse8Ky3cM:](https://www.google.com/search?q=fallout+4+far+harbour+diver+suit&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBGB820GB820&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJoazC2cjhAhUuQhUIHcRsCSQQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1858&amp;bih=977#imgrc=eOOFIbse8Ky3cM:)
---
Huh if the boss at the end of the dungeon is worse than the Fauxsquatch... ouch, maybe I shouldn't try to solo it
---
That would be amazing
---
I want my legendary Commie Whacker
---
It would still be a low chance. But at least you could slowly get better legendaries, which is nice if you have a signature weapon.
---
I do quite honestly, but maybe this topic will cause people to stash their junk so the vultures that go, will waste their caps to the event and get no rewards.
---
It says its recommended for 2 lvl50+ players so if your lvl100+ I think you'll be fine
---
Huh, I swear that’s not what my diving suit looked like. I didn’t mess with it much though, and I haven’t played FO4 in ages, I’m probably not remembering it
---
Some of them have nuclear material in them as well.  Fallout has some pretty funny stuff in it for sure!
---
Swap out strong back for travelling pharmacy, grenadier for two ranks in gunsmith, 2 ranks for like wanderer instead of hard bargain and you should be good
---
Tesla Rifle ain't bad either if you turn on pacifist. Your attacks will "hit" players and chain off of them, but without dealing damage. Makes it really easy to damage the boss while staying at a safe distance.
---
Also, the Power Armor mod that auto-uses stimpacks let me be the conduit for a pylon and tank the sheepsquatch, despite only being in minimum level excavator armor. Never once went down.
---
Frankly overpowered against melee enemies (packs of glowing ghouls are near-zero threat), and generally pretty good as long as you can get close without taking a lot of incoming fire.
---
Not even kidding that exact thing happened to me at the "One Violnet Night" event
---
It's funny. You have to suck pretty bad at this game for 300 caps to be worth running and hiding behind a new character.
---
Wasn't replying to your post, sorry!
---
And even if there was, it’s not like this would massively effect it. You’d have to spend hours, if not days farming resources. You’d burn yourself out doing it to exploit it
---
"BECAUSE I PLAY THE LONG GAME, MR. CASTLE"
---
I'll be on this evening (since I pretty much live on it).  Toss me a FR, join me and I'll help you any way I can.  My PSN is the same as here (pdt0830). I have to have something you can use in my stash be it weapons, armor, aid items, etc. No trade or payment needed.
---
Check what your dmg is with and without rifleman or guerilla perks cards are
---
If someone doesn’t want to pvp they shouldn’t be forced into number 1 on the leader board. This was the main issue with the longest life leader board. No one on the server would live more than an hour or two
---
This a billion times.
---
I recently set up four different camps for four different alts on the same day and goddamn if I didn't regret marsupial by the end of it. Not only do you jump half the time you want to connect wires, but you have to finish the jump before it tries again.
---
Na I think it's more down the line of a zetan EE
---
Good point, but I think it would be a nice bonus to people who have a blueprint for a weapon they use as a signature, like the minigun for me
---
It's a funny anecdote. Why are you so upset about it?
---
personally the hud is fine with me, it’s the ugly green flashlight that really irritates me
---
Have you repaired them? Already-broken things will “re-explode” if they haven’t been repaired since your last load in.
---
You mean so I don't slap an enemy with a grenade instead of a power attack??
---
Even if it allowed you to save extras to your system it would be cool. Then just upload them into the game. Idk
---
"massive player outrage."
---
hahahahahahahaha
---
Yep. From now on, I’m not lingering and I’m keeping my gun out
---
I think to go with your tip, if you see a bunch of gutsys just standing around, don’t kill them, they are passive and killing them make them respawn.  I was about 1/2 way through the pack before I figured out what was going on
---
Yes.
---
Had a very similar experience.  The messenger refused to move for 30 minutes.  I had wave after wave, including a 3*.  I was  playing on Survival during the double exp, so I leveled almost 3 times.  I failed the event, but enjoyed it the whole time.
---
Each datamine always has a few nice things for everyone. To me its always a case of "different strokes for different folks"
---
Just need the player cap limit to be higher now
---
/signed  
---
Especially for those of us who like setting up CAMP near new player spots. "Look at all the fun you will have!"
---
I’m not sure what you’re trying to say, but I really think you could benefit from a dose of Addictol.
---
Ease up on the chems, big shooter.
---
This boss will not run away and can't fly what makes pepper 2H PA build very powerful against it.
---
Yes sir.
---
You’re probably watching videos from before they nerfed TSE.
---
Most likely a TSE handmade or something similar. The other comments here are hilariously wrong.
---
When I load in these days, my camp, which is also on a hill, loads in piece by piece. I've seen my outside fusion generator actually fall slightly onto the deck it's placed on, complete with a small cloud of dust when it hits. I've wonder whether it's actually taking damage from this . . . or if the floor is.
---
Thst works
---
Heyyy with the neurobigotry. Get the fuck outta town bro!@
---
Yes!!!👍👍
---
YEs pleasE!
---
Jesus christ, here we go again.
---
What is it for? If you have aqua boy why would you need this?  It does look badass though.
---
Yes the math is there.  People can bulk buy resources with ease if their lazy or even farm them manually. 
---
This only serves the people now that have an excess of resources to blow on a gamble. 
---
You’d either have to create a new type of extremely hard to get resource to add to this for the crafting. 
---
That or make it so when regular crafting you have a really really like plausible low percent of crafting legendary item. 
---
Even with that. People are round the clock farming legendary items so this really isnt needed.
---
This statement is misleading.
---
&gt; wild mongrels in restroom stalls (how’d it get in there?)
---
Ohhh you'll be asking yourself that about a ***lot*** of things in the coming weeks...
---
This used to happen all the time to me, and I found a solution. Stay looking at the object untill the wire spawns in. I found it rarely happens to me now
---
You sure you need to hit her to get loot? I think I spawned once right as event was ending and I got loot immediately lol
---
Was the sub Reddit not blowing up a week ago about this? I don't see how a good portion of the vocal community saying this was a bad idea is not considered a massive player outrage.
---
I sort of don't want the plants easily growable, and I think the devs don't want certain ones easy to get for balance purposes. What I would like though is for them to put a larger quantity of the rare plants in locations with high level enemies so you can gather 20-40 pieces at once but there's some challenge to it. I don't want crafting powerful drinks to be the same tedium that plain beer is. Better yet put some of the more powerful ants around the areas with these plants so it's one stop shopping.
---
the only thing funny about it is that the OP thinks 300 caps is significant in any way and made a new character because he was afraid of losing 300 caps.
---
Apparently the perk Ghoulish counteracts the effects of the pylons. Still need to test it myself though.
---
It could consume flux from your inventory
---
I agree.  Players who handle the pylons deserve their share of the loot.  Kind of amazing that they didn't set it up that way.
---
Add me on PS4 I’d love to see you there! :)
---
I think whole event is crazy chaos. 4/5 sentinel 200lvl with 20stimpacks and i die in 2mins. People around just run and maybe sometimes shoot. This  should be fun?
---
Bethesda do difficulty by bulletsponging or crazy damage. First one succesful was nice experience, but when you want to farm it, you have another nightmare like killing 25legendaries in survival mod.
---
I like the idea.  And your mockup :)
---
Yes, I repair them every login
---
Yes, because it's bull crap how during that whole ordeal not a single comment was said regarding what was being done or we were heard. Now after the patch and things calmed down it's being swept under the rug.
---
Idk, maybe she died too far away from me, but I didn't get to loot the corpse
---
No it wasn’t. Can you provide a citation for that? They literally said “until we don’t make anything new, we are going to give you free stuff forever”? I think your entitlement is showing
---
Maybe you live in a fantasy world. That needs medication
---
"Catastrophe" is a rather strong word.
---
I agree that they need to make money and I regularly drop money into the atom shop. I do not believe that anyone here is under the Illusion that the game and everything in it should be free. I have no issue with atom shop content or having to buy a copy of the game, I just want good communication. Better communication could clear up so many issues and worries.
---
Same here.
---
Flux is an easily gained resource. You’ll need to make something that after a week of grinding for it you have a small spoon full to show for it.
---
I can confirm that you do not. I've done them all.
---
Why do you need so many teammates, are you that bad at pvp that you need a small platoon to help you defeat people? Of course you can’t find action because the second people notice you’ve brought a third of the server to take them and their 1 friend in they will leave.
---
You’ve created your own problem, congrats.
---
I'm saying leave repair all to only fix stuff that is broken. Not touch stuff that is damaged. Let you manually select stuff to repair that is not yet broken. Like if you have a turret that is down to 10%. Repair all won't fix it. But you can manually walk upto it and repair it to full.
---
Awesome news. Thanks. I just wanted poly and ultra-light.
---
It takes 2 stats to specialize in every weapon other than Rifles. The perk system is the only thing that prevents you from being able to swap freely to whatever weapon you want with maximized damage in the middle of combat. Once redoing all your perks in the middle of combat takes two seconds, that does definitely remove the concept of specializations.
---
With Strength and Agility at 15 you gain full specialization in Unarmed, 1-Handed Weapons, 2-Handed Weapons, Shotguns, Heavy Guns (Both), and all Pistols; plus over half of both Power Armor and Non-power armor perks. How does being able to swap between then in 2 seconds **not** begin to remove the concept specializations?
---
Like I said, I'd love to see a vanilla Perk Loadout mechanic, but it has to be limited and not something that can be done anytime, anywhere.
---
Little bit. You still need to spam stimpacks.
---
Welcome to fallout 76
---
But whats the point? They wanted to create a "high stakes survival mode". I dont need the game to hold my hand all the time, i was actually looking forward to a bit of risk but nope they had to nerf it. Im not saying you should loose double your level in caps but there has to be some kind of middle ground or incentive to actually want to be top of the leaderboard.
---
You and I both man. It all happened after we failed the encryptid event and got mad at the other squad with us and decided to duke it out fists only😂. Then I made a boxing ring and everyone around white springs came to watch it was the most fun I’ve ever had on this game. Can’t wait to make it an official thing with prizes involved!
---
I'm not going to lie to you, my vocabulary is lacking and I had no idea what word to use.
---
it was. it was a huge backlash, and almost every single post on the front page was about how shitty it is that they are doing this. it was like that for at least a couple days
---
all of a sudden people forgot that and are cool with edging into p2w items. i don't get it.
---
Sounds awesome dude! I'll see you this evening!
---
I removed the generator on the inside, the only other one is outside to the right of my base. I play on Xbox btw, dunno if it’s a console only bug
---
How do you actually get the side quests? I thought I read something about finding a holotape somewhere but I have completed the Lying Lowe quest and never received a quest about tracking a bear named Fluffy.
---
Oh I don’t think I’ve looted the corpse before it’s usually empty...
---
But props to you for holding all the pylons...we need more people like you
---
That sounds amazing, I'm tired of doing events and having 1-3 mobs come to attack 1-2 minutes apart. Give me hordes! Give me a panic!
---
So... who the hell cares?
---
Much higher then from mobs i have over 500 hours and like thousands of legendary mobs killed and i drop my first bloodied handmade just two days ago 😳
---
Or that the leather is slower to heat and therefore offers more protection to flesh beneath whereas the metal will conduct the heat quickly?
---
It's a possibility, but I've heard that it's in the files but disabled. Fully programmed and ready to be dropped in the world, but they just... didn't. So they must be waiting for something, but the question is what?
---
Wow, this is a great idea though. I'm totally planning on showing up!
---
The main loot isn't on her corpse. The main loot is given when the mission completes.
---
I think what we need to do is each pylon gets a crew, 1 conduit and one rez-er.  So the conduit activates the pylon and then hides away, I think the best place might be on top of the pylon itself, staying close seems to help the damage taken.  
---
Then the Rez-er stick by the conduit and has quack surgeon, beer, and any other Rez-type perks and his job is to keep that conduit alive, and anyone else nearby if it doesn’t sacrifice the conduit.
---
k
---
I think it's a combination of them wanting players to start new characters and the fact that starting a new character allows you to unlock a whole pile of atoms with fresh character specific challenges. So they seem to be bumping the difficulty on daily challenges to balance it out so the same rate of free atoms is flowing.
---
c
---
PC player here.  Glad I'm not the only one who thinks this is awkward and also experiencing the glitches.
---
I miss being able to fire through each item and quickly repair it.
---
Just because someone shouts the loudest doesn't mean they are right.
---
I realize that the social media generation has a difficult time understanding this.
---
if you're on PC you can change that in the .ini
---
I don’t see any of them whining. Only you. You don’t seem to understand how the world works. Life doesn’t cater to you. They have done enough to provide a service and product. You purchased it. They are not beholden to continue coddling you. Supply and demand, and capitalism, can affect this issue, but you can’t just demand free stuff and have anyone take you seriously
---
Someone to uncover the mystery......
---
https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/06/13/fallout-76-no-paid-dlc-or-microtransactions/
---
If you're using hundreds of Stimpacks as the conduit, you should not be the conduit... You should be using 0-20 or so tops depending on your build.
---
Bruh you’ve been on about stability for literal months now. It’s not the subreddit it’s you
---
No one said anything about cheating. I think you posted on the wrong page
---
Same for me.   
---
Yeah if you’ve done damage to the imposter you can loot the corpse and get the event rewards. If you don’t, you still get the event rewards.
---
Oh, yes it does. So long as the pylons are all active. I shoot it, the health drops, and stays down. It takes damage.
---
If you choose to not believe that there is an economy in this game that’s your choice. But there is one.
---
He's lost.
---
You need to go to the Charleston capital building and report a lost bot. There may be some paperwork and lines to wait in.
---
Read the recent patch notes. The information you seek is there.
---
Nice build
---
The bonus dmg goes away entirely at 100 dr, anything above 100dr will give the weapon less dmg than it would normally have. At 0 dr it will have 50% more dmg.
---
It sounds cool, sure.
---
But, BSG does not need to be an image storage service. What you are suggesting is an entire business all by itself. Game assets are stored on your device. Only data/telemetry is transferred during game play, no binaries.
---
The lag on this kind of thing would be immense as would the cost.
---
Now, if it was only on your gameplay and all the world saw a generic that might work but it is still a lot of work to get such a specific thing to work.
---
All vendors now share a single cap pool. Instead of 7 pools of 200, it’s one pool of 1400
---
I'd definitely approve of something like that.
---
Or a general LFG emote that could show up on the map.
---
And what would be right here? A company who doesn't give a crap about you and just wants your money going against what they said (not just this time but many times in the past) and not being held accountable for their actions? This shit would not have flown in the past so why do we have to lie down and take this just because they are a triple A gaming company that releases the occasional good game.
---
It’s almost like this subreddit has people with different opinions. Crazy.
---
This. Read the patch notes before complain, people!
---
*presents a large platter of cheese to go with this whine*
---
What's your gt ill help you
---
If only. Not much of a mystery to solve if the creature in question can't spawn. I'm just hoping The Burrows turns out to be a secret Sheepsquatch Part Two.
---
Can a Bethesda rep fix this and then reply with a He-Man meme, "I have the power!"
---
I think the devs need to look at loot and legendary stuff and start making some buffs. If they made a troubleshooters weapon do 65pct extra damage with built in weight reduction perks people would use them. Right now things like that are easily outclassed by simple 2 shot guns that don't discriminate against enemy type. 
---
If the new dungeon is full of tough mirelurks an improved exterminator weapon would be pretty amazing.
---
An explosive troubleshooters rifle would be awfully good right now against the imposter.
---
Basically they just need to look at these trash legendaries and boost them in a meaningful way. All legendaries should be......legendary in their own way.
---
On PS4
---
&gt;Ran Watoga 4 times in 2 days.  Still legendaries.  Got 3 star and it dropped 3 star armor. And the usual 1 star crap.  The issue.. as always is when low levels show up...  they spawn lower level enemies.  
---
Hmm ok...
---
&gt; You also must do the entire run and not cherry pick the homes and or the golf club... Level up folks. 
---
And there it is. Watoga =/= whitesprings
---
The Messenger event got buffed back in Patch 7.  Especially in the Savage Divide, it's actually rather fun now, although not that amazing from a loot perspective.
---
It also really stretches the legs of popping a grape mentat too. You can sell less stuff, still make 1400, and then buy back supplies for cheaper, which restocks the cap pool a bit then sell some more to get you caps back.
---
yeah and where were those people when the sub was exploding against repair kits in the shop? clearly there wasn't enough of them to quell the noise before. now all of a sudden you cant mention the repair kits without being downvoted.
---
How often does the vendor bot spawn? I have never come across him :(
---
On Xbox if that makes a difference..
---
OMG :) did not think that it would be possible, congrats :)
---
LMAO!
---
Dude, literally Google fallout 76 lead. Will take you to a page thats like hey there you lazy shit you can get lead here.
---
I have to disagree, because having some cards as passives, not needing to be equipped, would be far more effective. The entire issue is that it's a hassle having to switch cards around whenever I want to pick a lock, hack a terminal, craft an item, or sell off junk - and having loadouts (Decks) would do very little to alleviate this problem. It'd save a couple button clicks, sure, but you'd still need to go in and switch your loadout before every one of those, then hope you remember to switch it back afterwards.
---
Agreed. It really irks me that they're just standing their awkwardly. Personally I think they also need a little more personality, give 'em names like the other Vendor bots, and maybe a unique paint job or something to make 'em stand out. As far as i can tell only the Responders vendor stands out at all since it's got the Responders logo on its chest.
---
Seeds?
---
We are aware of this issue and investigating it.
---
For weapons it’s actually 24 for a one star. There’s 10 major modifiers, and 13 minor modifiers. If you have a 1/100 chance of getting a legendary, for farming a specific three star, you have a 0.0032% chance of getting what you want. Tell me how that is easy to get, I’m curious
---
Id say instead of collecting a geck wed havw to build a geck, so wed have to go fighting through various areas to collect these "only found in this 1 location" resources, then bring them all together at a certain machine and assemble a geck while we fight off hoardes of attacking enemies, then we must use the geck in a location, leave the area before it activates (or you die) then you get "The Green Zone" on the map where everything is alive and flourishing, water is pure, new varients of plants are available to harvest and craft (like flux) and unmuted or super mutated versions of the aninals are tgere to fight and collect other resources from (like the hardened mass but different)
---
I slightly like my secluded area a bit. Moving to a more populated area and having to spend additional time server hopping until my plot of land is open for me to use when I'm already fairly limited on time each night? No thanks. 
---
Past few days I've had to server hop a couple times. But if my camp was next to a popular area, would probably be a lot worse. It just started happening really. Previously I would get that message maybe once a month. Now I'm seeing it a couple times a week.

 &gt; We are aware of this issue and investigating it.
---
I really want to see Lincoln's Repeater make an appearance here. I know it wouldn't be canon but I really could look the other way for that one.
---
Yeah hopefully, if not i can see them adding it with the camara
---
I'd say the condition of the server plays a role too.  The CAMP tends to load faster on a fresher server or one with fewer players.
---
...because I just started learning and that’s what they’re teaching us in class to begin.
---
But thanks for the shaming!
---
Please don't comment if you're ignorant on this issue. The repair kits that will come to the atomic shop will repair your weapon to 100%. The ones that can be found (and will be rare) will repair your weapon to 150%.
---
Just go like directly north of Aaronholt farm. It's up in that big empty patch of space between that Raider camp in the mountains and the WV lumber co.
---
I already askex another guy but what was that suit for?
---
Because it’s not p2w . It’s a subpar convenience
---
Day of the new update I was excited to see what the new vendors in Whitespring were gonna look like, was kinda disappointed they just shoved generic looking and sounding Protectrons in the existing shops.
---
Honestly I’d much rather to be able to scrap legendary weapons to learn guaranteed mods. Sucks having to craft tons of infrequently dropped weapons (radium rifles, handmade, etc) just to scrap them. When I find a nocturnal version, I hang onto it fr legendary vendor, but so would totally scrap it if I knew I’d get a mod out of it :)
---
Ps4. Thanks you for pointing this out :) I'll have to have a look u k ow its a trapper piece
---
What about pumpkins and cranberries?
---
so now they will probably buff here from lv70 to a lv91 in the next patch , lol
---
What’s a fair drop chance for 3 stars in your opinion?  1%?  5%?  10%?
---
I mean if your not using your old account can I have it? Would love it for storage.
---
A lot of fanboys out there 😂 but when its about repair kits that nobody forces them to buy all hell breaks loose
---
Many thanks!
---
Reaaaally glad i have been investing in vampire explosive and vampire swing speed weapons!
---
It's testing the waters before diving in. They want to see how this goes and when it goes well they'll start adding other items like things to keep food fresh, something that boosts experience or reduces hunger and thirst. The company is just trying to sneak in an lion by first sneaking in a kitten.
---
But thanks for the shaming for attempting to learn a new language! Solid take!
---
Just outside of Whitespring is best (outside nuke zone). I imagine people will realize this sooner or later and it will cause space issues. It's the hub for almost everything.
---
You read that article, not just the title? Free dlc, but the atoms are obviously not free entirely. And “for years to come” is not infinite. They also don’t specify what, and the game has to make money. 
---
I think you didn’t really think about this that much. But I appreciate the article cause I had NOT seen it
---
Green Country and Charleston Fire Station weight rooms (and off the kitchen).
---
Pleasant Valley and Prison can chimes. Sometimes you can even server hop Pleasant Valley multiple times for 6 traps in a couple minutes.
---
Bog Town police department. Maybe Charleston newspaper, but I could be misthinking and that one is good for springs.
---
Build your camp on either a lead deposit or a junk pile, or both.
---
What’s your gt
---
Not sure why you need to question my ability in pvp. This is a social game and as such I enjoy playing with groups of friends and not excluding anyone. Looking for constructive comments and ideas, thanks.
---
I did a census Violence yesterday and all that showed up were a handful of scorched.
---
If this is a PA build then Stabilized is a priority perk. If it's not a PA build then it probably won't be very good.
---
Bullet Shield is a very weak perk even with a PA build due to how DR stacks.
---
Nice research, might be worth it to submit that 2 shot issue as a bug.  Like you said either the display is bugged or the legendary effect is bugged but in either case, something is not working correctly.
---
I moved from a more secluded spot to a more populated one. I might either move back, or look for a not so populated spot.
---
I'm on the water across the road from Pleasant Valley Station and used to be at the bottom of the Savage Divide just north of the bear and a bit west of Johnson's Acre.
---
And to answer OP : not that issue. But i have not played since patch on ps4. Some lag/stagger every 3-5 seconds makes it unplayable 😤😤
---
Would really greasy. Select a few billboards in game to fix up and bam.
---
I remember my first run at Arktos.   I’m now a 101 and I still run it every day for fusion cores.  It feels like home, a home where I kill everyone and everything.  Good times.
---
2 stimpaks
---
Just a reading bug.
---
It is PA orientated. So replace bullet shield with stabilized?
---
Oh, no doubt!
---
Bethesda clearly stated that there are two different kits. Basic for atoms and The improved repair kits can only be earned for completing in-game content. Please educate yourself.
---
I would absolutely love this idea. I take countless pictures so my loading screens are full of memories, but if i can select certain ones to hang in my CAMP bedroom? Oh my goodness
---
I watched the documentary when it came out.  I followed the release of the game closely.  There are a bunch of streams and interviews and such where they said all content and DLC will be free forever.    They also said on many places that the atom shop will be cosmetic only.
---
Yes, please, I don't even like when people were talking about main quest stuff.  What's the point of a spoiler filter if nobody even bothers using them here? 
---
I know 76 doesn't have a main quest like the other games, but there are still things people are figuring out.  At least be considerate if you're not going to use tags.
---
The reason why I think it's not the best idea is because with the current state of food buffs it would throw the balance out a bit, this is the same reason I think spoilage is fine how it is.
---
Food buffs stack and there are a ton of different buffs from them. I rarely hear people talk about them at all but once I started needing food a lot because of Speed Demon I started noticing the affect foods have. We're talking about stacking +15-25 in Damage resistance, +15-25 in Energy resistance, +5% XP buffs, +2 to all special stats, and crit increases by +10%. All at once, for 30-60 minutes and that's just from crop based food.
---
I do agree with some of the posters here that limiting the biome would be fine. You could plant something anywhere, but it wouldn't grow or even self destroy over time if it were the wrong biome. But being able to max out plant buffs from any location on the map just seems like it would create a new meta and people would start complaining that they NEED to waste time farming instead of playing the game to compete.
---
To get a specific three star you would need at minimum 2,000 crafts. You can get basically all the mods by then I’d hope.
---
lol ..this..just go on youtube
---
And you thought turrets ate into your camp budget... But this would be awesome.
---
That makes sense. It was a pretty neat set up, maybe I’ll try to fond the location and make a replica like someone here said.
---
And chainsaw
---
Sorta but only lol who run in excavator are hoarders who collect junk n such. Not my playstyle
---
I just realised I didn't have first aid equipped, so that probably contributed. It took them like five minutes to kill her, I thought it was never going to end lol.
---
I thought of that.
---
Not sure if I want to be around there or a bit into the divide for fast travel cost yet.
---
Also, for how perk cards are, i put demolition expert for a place holder. I figured I could switch to the crafting perks when I go to craft. Is that a good way to do it?
---
Would make Brotherhood and Enclave plays a lot cooler.
---
Is cryolator a heavy weapon or is it a rifle?
---
&gt;The perk system is the only thing that prevents you from being able to swap freely to whatever weapon you want 
---
So the slow clunky interface is actually a \_balancing\_ feature?  
---
&gt; How does being able to swap between them in 2 seconds **not** begin to remove the concept specializations? 
---
Because you still committed the Special points to the build, which requires compromises.  You act like Strength 15 and Agility 15 is the God-build.  It's not.  It's just a compromise like any other "specialization".  If they didn't want you to be able to run Heavy Guns \_and\_ Melee then they would have done things differently. 
---
I understand what you're saying but I don't think the clunkiness of the interface is so holy that it shouldn't be altered/minimized.  Yes, people would be able to fire a heavy gun and quickly switch to melee or pistols.  That's a sacrifice I'd be willing to make to spend less time clicking through cards just to pick a lock, eat dog  food, repair my gear, sell to vendors etc.  I don't have all day and night to play.  When I have time I want to spend it playing, not rearranging a deck of cards.
---
You're getting pretty good at it so far
---
Although I don't know the language
---
Bullet shield is really weak. Take Blocker instead if you're playing tank.
---
Lots of perks there that should be swap-ins: Super Duper, Power Smith, Ammosmith etc.
---
Allow photos taken from the camera able to be printed and frame like posters in our camps! Their is already a ton of printers around Appalachia!
---
Im on ps4, but also shelved for now
---
I think it would make them all a lot cooler, but yeah, definitely BOS and Enclave.
---
How is that not constructive? I mean you really don’t think the fact that your team is 3-4 times bigger or at least double the size of most other teams, isn’t a contributing factor in you finding no ‘action’ on survival servers? People don’t want a massively unfair fight, and you obviously don’t want a fair one. Git gud.
---
I had this happen a few times with the messenger that starts off near Summerville Lake.
---
&gt; all of a sudden people forgot that and are cool with edging into p2w items.
---
1) get over yourself.
---
2) people didn't get over it, they are simply following the wishes of the mods that after 24 hours from the mod post, users were to cease flooding the subreddit with posts complaining about the repair kits.
---
Not calling you a liar, just saying it's unlikely they survive to take the loot away.
---
I basically did too hard a sneeze, and did a Shart, anyone know of a Power Armor Cleaning service? Kinda smells funky in here right now.....
---
Yeah from reading a few posts over the last few days as well as server hopping at Watoga myself it would appear another stealth nerf went down that adjusted or eliminated the ability for the robots to spawn as Legendary there.
---
You are going to get a ton of different responses here because it is so build and preference dependant. 
---
Do you want to kill them fast, or efficiency? How much ammo usage is acceptable?
---
Do you want to kill them in the air or on the ground?
---
The context sensitive nature of spacebar binding is also an issue with searching containers (server lags so I jump instead of searching) and trading (try to jump but a player is nearby so it tries to initiate trade).
---
Seriously, why was this taken out? I want my HUD to be green or light purple.
---
hmmm, maybe Bethesda should MOVE THE SPAWN POINT for the vendor?
---
Seriously, its the perfect spot for a player's camp. There are two sets of buildings that make the perfect defensible position for building and limits the amount of resources needed to build a great base. The closeness to water is merely a bonus. Also the proximity to a train station is another great feature.
---
I just learned about this vendor today, and guess where my camp is? I spent a lot of time perfecting it and I'm loathe to move it.
---
If you have a problem with people building there, you and your cronies should spam Bethesda with complaints until they do something about it (likely never, let's be serious).
---
I am the ~~Lorax~~ Fo76 Reddit, I speak for the ~~trees~~ playerbase!
---
This might be a dumb question as I am a PC user.  But doesn’t PS4 have an app for Dropbox or GDrive or any cloud service like that? 
---
Also, I know when I was playing on PS4 a ton (Spider-Man) I was saving tons of photos and videos and then offloading them to Twitter via the PS4 social media link.  Once it’s posted to Twitter, it is in your feed and you can run over there and download it to a cloud.  
---
I know this is probably more steps than you’d like, but after doing so often I got pretty good at the work flow.
---
Also, what about just keeping a flash drive in your PS4 ?
---
I hope the sewers are based off actual sewers and some Bethesda employees had to go down to get every detail right for this game.
---
And honestly it would probably be better to put more in to bear arms and only do the first level of the heavy guns perks under strength. You get the most gain out of those and the other ones are minimal additions.
---
I'm mostly a heavy weapons guy now myself and I found that it works out well that way. Suppressor and tenderizer under Charisma also.
---
Not the best, but its a build I guess😛 Lots of points in places that could have been spend better. Things like night person and MS are very gimmicky. Fun, but far from optimal. Fire in the hole R2 is also not that useful. The trowing arc is nice, but do you really find the need to trow your grenades further? Not rly worth the point to me ;p
---
However; I am an elitist kinda person that went for a straight pure build. This build will still work, and you should/can use it if you want to. But it's not optimalized.
---
it’s a new bug from the latest patch/update
---
Your English is so perfect I  thought you were a bot because it's hard to believe anybody speaks English so well.
---
What devs are trying to "trick" you?  They do not and literally cannot know what you do or don't regret, and besides whether you regret something is entirely on you, not them. Sometimes we make bad decisions. I bought more groceries last week than I needed. I regret that, but it's not the store's fault for selling them to me.  They did not try to "trick" me into anything.   
---
I agree with you, I also prefer a monthly subscription. (Except I always forget to cancel them for a couple months after I stop playing).   But I just don't think there's any malicious intent, or deception or anything like that involved.
---
Didn't they already say this is on the "to-do" list in one of their recent blogs?
---
Never done that. What does it make me? A noob? =)
---
That was the one.
---
I'd love it if conduit snapped to ceilings and walls. Need more wall conduit bits too....
---
what causes that?
---
I made a post about this a week ago and called a simple meta bitch.....
---
Cliffs have been my bane in camp making. Your assumption that they are inside the cliff is probably accurate.
---
OP probably doesn't even play the game.
---
Its all about timing i guess..
---
I’m happy for it . Fk ballistic fiber
---
Six of one, half a dozen of the other. We are essentially saying the same thing, just differently. 🙂
---
Hey, remember this?
---
&gt;I run a melee assassin stealth build that stays at 20% hp, 80% radiation, its to simulate old stealth games 
---
Just curious, what did that make your HP? 40-200? How far did you get? What difficulty do/did you play? Mods or vanilla? Did you use VATS at all? Put skill points in Sneak or Ninja? Sorry for the stream of questions on a random old comment, but I just stumbled here trying to find out of Unyielding stacks and am so curious about your playstyle.
---
Can we go there solo?
---
My mistake they were plans sorry English is my second language 🥺
---
There could be special "planters" that are like an enclosed chamber and require direct power for growing certain kinds of plants.
---
Make sure you slowly back up if she is focusing you, as to avoid taking too much damage as to outclass your healing. and to keep her from acting like most enemies who melee, circling you and throwing off your aim
---
Meele, I just need 2 hits!
---
to be fair, you're right. i forgot about the mod post.
---
nonetheless, support in the comments is nowhere near what it was, and again, just about any mention of the repair kits gets you downvoted to oblivion. there was definitely a tone shift.
---
Thank you for your helpful suggestion. 👍
---
Go check out NW corner WV lumberyard and aaronholdt farms.
---
You’re welcome!
---
If the perks had been balanced out so that passive perks, weapons perks, and defense perks weren't all clumped into a single stat like they are we'd be in a better position.
---
With what you're saying you want it for, the idea of limiting it to the same constraints as fast travel seem to be a fair and balanced middle ground. As long as there are no enemies near by I'd have no problem with a vanilla Perk Loadouts.
---
Mods cannot be attached. They broke with Tuesday's update. Had hoped they would fix that today...
---
Just have to wait.
---
HEY GUYS! I DID SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE AN OPTION TO DO IN THE GAME!
---
LOL. You call that "outrage"? Check the anthem subreddit, there you see outrage. People here get slightly mad but as soon as bethesda does something right - or not even right, if they don't fuck it up - the start sucking their dicks again OH YOURE THE GREATEST COMPANY IN THE WORLD.
---
Get a grip on reality. Bethesda is playing you.
---
All I know is they said even the strongest players will have a hard time. It is designed as a dungeon, meant to be tackled with a party; but I guess we'll have to wait and see how hardcore it is!
---
Matchmaking... For what?
---
Yea I’m still a shitty Reddit user lmao so yes for op
---
I don't have one with swing speed, but Vampire's equipment is great with the types of constant mobs you see in this battle.
---
I am a hop skip and jump away from Harpers Ferry. Now that I think about it, the upcoming dungeon is probably why i am seeing more times where my spot is taken.  
---
I have wanted to redo my camp anyway. I took a risk earlier this week and didn't server hop when a nuke was launched that my camp was in radius of. I'm still not fully repaired up (mainly my crops), but sticking around let me get the nuked flora I needed to upgrade my Excavator PA... was semi worth it. Lol.
---
I love it when the community comes together to help each other out.
---
Lolz only for raiders PA.
---
The t45 starts at 25 🤦‍♂️
---
It's a tough one. A good melee build could kill a scorchbeast in a few hits, but only when it's on the ground. Heavy weapons are powerful but from my experience with my 50cal and minigun are mostly inaccurate when the scorchbeast is in the air and waste a lot of ammo. Id personally say a stealth commando/vats critical spam build, using a handmade rifle would be effective
---
It's a heavy weapon.
---
Pc ign is mischapex
---
That a diver suit from far harbor
---
Does any one else get some of the enemies in the "battle bot" quest spawn in friendly? Wasn't a big problem before, but can't VATS them now.
---
Ran it a Fton the last 2 days with nothing to show for it. These stealth nerfs are really old. BGS has a serious issue with transparency .
---
Good idea. I’m gonna do that right now. Totally slipped my mind lol
---
No minuteman ones I hate Preston 🤬
---
Playing the game right now
---
first, we need printer..
---
Was hoping this would take a bigger team than 2 to complete, but it's a start I guess.
---
I agree, shit loads of stuff you should be swapping out.  
---
You are going to want mutations, so swap out scrounger and super duper with class freak and starched genes  
---
Swap out ammosmith with adrenaline
---
The football outfit is cool.  I keep hoping for a cheerleader outfit to show up XD. There was a partial football helmet in a previous data mine that hasn't shown up yet that I'll probably get.
---
Ya, i bought it before the mass duper banning and I still have it.  I dont think cryolators drop with the explosive effect anymore. Holding on to mine!!
---
Prepare to downvote this comment to hell..... go back to the console. Whilst the console version is not without it's many own issues, generally it's playable without too much fussing about with settings. But yeah, it must be annoying to have a PC that makes the specs and still doesn't run nice.
---
I'm trying for an optimal build so i take those off. My first builds were mostly for trying out the game (and playing around with the mechanics of it)
---
the barrows, encryptid, sbq.
---
Back in my day sunny we only had 200 pounds
---
im guessing he wants a system where it looks for players above X level for the co-op content IF you cannot find people on your own
---
How would you know which is best? Like is there a measurable unit for killing scorchbeasts? I've got 5 different high level chars that can all take them down quick enough. Commando or bloodied melee is probably quickest, gunslinger is slower but uses less ammo, pa slugger is safest. Got a support guy with no combat talent that murders them with a zealots cryolator so pros and cons would suggest one of those.
---
Thanks for all the awesome input everyone!  Hey be definitely been the non-contributing idiot both times I “completed” this.
---
Very helpful, can you define "tanking"
---
Exactly. People are out here trying to discredit other people’s experiences with zero claim to do so. It’s juvenile and pathetic and only serves to support misinformation as opposed to intelligent awareness.
---
Griefer for attacking the camp or griefer for building the camp there?  
---
Hint:  It’s not for attacking!
---
I'm pretty sure it's a bug that's been in the game for a couple weeks now. The solution is to wait till Bethesda fixes it, sadly.
---
I should start using that now.
---
Sbq they said 8 players (i can do it solo) new boss just 2 people can do it just fine (not sure about solo yet). I don't mind playing with others but i want a bit of a challenge it's why i would like to go there solo, unless i can take couple low lvls with me to increase amount of spawns, on screen shot i see ghouls and can't imagine those to be a threat at all.
---
Please filter the sub by "new" posts. No, you're not the only one having this issue and there are literally dozens of posts about it.
---
It would be cool to have faction specific decorations/camp items but i believe none or most of them should go to the atomic shop. they should all be acquirable from faction specific events and quests as well as maybe random encounters with plans. maybe paint jobs for armor, weapons and power armor could be in the atom shop. also it would be cool to get a spray ability where we would be able to spray on the faction logo on a wall (like some raider outposts have).
---
OK thanks! I'll probably keep them in heavy gunner ranks until i figure out what to do with them. I'll take it they still are end game viable without the 10% increases?
---
Okay I’m at little behind what does that do?
---
Possible teaser for Nuclear Winter?
---
Butcher's bounty is super helpful for making rad any lager as well. Sometinesthat deathclaw kills those ants too quickly for me to get in there, so you can always search their bodies if ypur grenades don't manage to tag them.
---
Also sometimes when trying connect pylons together pylon 1 wont connect to plyon 2, but pylon 2 will connect to pylon 1.
---
I am so for this. As long as it isn't spammed to the whole server like hunters hunted
---
This is how the party/duty finder from FFXIV functions and is a great example of how it could be implemented in Fo76. Only thing I'm curious about is whether or not there are going to be roles required for multiplayer content. 
---
In most MMOs you can't take a dungeon without at least a tank or a half but I seriously doubt that many folks have specced into healing or group benefits, and it's pretty much impossible to respect quickly and fill those roles, so  I'm hoping each dungeon just needs a certain amount of DPS.
---
Wait what's the limit
---
Yeah I don't know if they said it for flavor or are legit. That's why I'm saying we'll have to wait and see. They might be the baddest ghouls in the hood 😂
---
That’s the connection to the helmet.
---
Makes the target a lot stronger for 60 seconds. But also makes it weaker for 60 seconds after the time is up
---
To future readers, he's referring to his location on the map, not his marker. It's a birdwatching perch (looks like a dock out of water) lined with glowing bottles (supposedly containing fireflies).
---
25k
---
I was speaking of CAMP items here, but yeah, repair kits are providing mobility and should cost more than repairing at an immobile bench.
---
But weapons can already be repaired once below 100% condition, they don't have to break completely the way CAMP items do before they can be repaired.
---
I’ve purchased 30k at this point
---
Yeah don't worry, I also was wondering what the hell that suit was until it randomly hit me that the helmet looked familiar. Though I think that the one in the burrows is a bit less "greener", but that may be just the lighting
---
Hit me up, I've got a group of four to 12 friends that play every night and are in a similar situation.
---
GT = TEH RED ZMAN
---
I respectfully disagree. People are coming back to play new quests, new events, and discover new content. Not to get better loot.
---
Seriously?  -  Man, they fix one thing, and break ten other things.  Bugthesda!
---
Try getting that last and looking for the other clues first, then downloading the coordinates.
---
Its definently most forgotten, always forget to go back to 111 in fo4.
---
I've seen posts exactly like this one so many times. How dont you all realize this has already been discussed numerous times?
---
I believe Endurance effects disease rate. There are also perks to lower disease rate.
---
I am guessing you have invested in neither.
---
What's even more frustrating is you can't thank them without a mic on pc at all.
---
Oof
---
That's weird I was getting an awful lot of anti-armor and furious guns. I got two identical furious LMG's from the same mob in whitesprings club house.. I thought it was related to me purging my stash of a bunch of other types of guns I didn't want (but was holding onto for the legendary vendor). Now almost all of my legendary guns are AA, furious, or two shot. 
---
I've also been finding a ton of high value outfits. I got like 30 golf outfits at WS the other night on one server.
---
This is a forum. People give their opinions here. Welcome. Enjoy your stay.
---
It put stuff on steroids till it wears off, but then they are weaker then they were originally.  I'm guessing since it's a boss monster you only get the steroid part.
---
I just read that Endangerol Syringer reduces targets damage resistance by 25% for 2 minutes. That’s a lot!
---
I'd rather kill them in the air, preferrably with a gatling laser/plasma
---
Easiest way is either a Vats crit build or just anything that cripples them easily so they get down. For example shotguns with enforcer or heavyguns with one man army. Once they are down they are no problem to deal with.
---
MMO term. Tanking refers to the player being the bosses primary target. That player wants to have as much defence as possible instead of offence.
---
Thank you for proving my point. You said you weren't buying them because they drop. But the ones in the atom shop don't drop in world as I stated. Looks like you schooled yourself
---
Me too, but I never really found it that useful in Fo4. Maybe i just never gave it a proper chance.
---
The all rise did and that's all I've used for 30 some lvls so far so I'm good.
---
Don’t worry too much about crafting power armor now, try to wait until lvl 50 to craft any. You will be kicking yourself later if you attach the mods you want to a lvl 30 piece, only to find out you can’t take the mod off again.
---
Player CAMPs are gonna be visible on map once player vending arrives(and immune to player damage). I assume it'll be an option to show it or not, depending if you've got a vending machine at your CAMP.
---
I bought it on my US account
---
We will see just my point is 1 player with proper pve focused build is stronger then 8 players with excavator and qol builds.
---
Please assume the position.
---
It begins at dusk and ends at dawn, every day cycle.
---
A tank is a person designed to take the brunt of the damage from an enemy without dying.  A "Tank" (as in the plated military vehicle).
---
Plus doesn't radaway reduce your resistance?
---
Until 3 months later when you come back and everyone just treats it as normal now. Cognitive dissonance.
---
Yeah. Let's just say since adopting it, I'm unlikely to ever go hungry.
---
It drives me nuts that it says I can place something and then it vanishes. Based off you what you said I guess they're lost forever unless I reset my camp :(
---
Between those two I prefer a gatling laser because I also use the cores for power armor.
---
My Endurance is 7 and I have the Vaccinated Perk. This wasn’t a problem until patch 4 or 5.
---
Hail!

Far more effective. Spend the 10 seconds and swap perk cards to craft ammo, etc.
---
Wow, someone in here is just giving out gold like candy. Thank you kind stranger!
---
Oh no I got you. I'm just saying I only know what you know. I hope it's a fair challenge that suits most players :)
---
I wish we could get this as well, or hide some perks we dont plan on using for this character like hiding a rifleman perk on a character who is melee and we would rather swap out shotguns or heavy weapons. Just a way to get to things quicker. A loadout would be optimal and I wish that is what we could have. I find crafting would go smoother if we could swap in the weapon and armor repair perks, super duper, the chem crafting one and the ammo perk when crafting.
---
Never leave without it, queen and squach
---
I completely skip this one. Even with Butcher's Bounty I usually get screwed out of the meat from killing them and then at my level I need to deal with a level 91 glowing Deathclaw. Better to go to Lucky Hole Mine and Appalachian Antiques for 3-6 total.
---
Seems to be a common issue. For me the quest completely disappeared from my pip-boy after the latest update, along with the objects linked to it. Now I can't finish it! Bummer.
---
I kept switching servers until I ran into a person with a card, but needed the terminal to work. I just kept joining her game until I spawned into the start of the event! And we killed him with 2 and a half minutes left! There was probably 15-18 people there, mostly lvl 60-150. It wasn’t easy that’s for sure. I think I’m going to switch from be lever to my aae lever next time tho! I got the fedora but really wanted the imposter head! I’m going to keep at it tho!
---
Yeah I had to leave a cave base because like 3% of my budget was stuck above the roof in the rock for the sane reason.
---
Are you stupid?  Power armor was around for 100s of years before bikes were invented. Bicycles are much more advanced, they give you exercise and the ability to move.  Power armor requires energy and if less healthy. - Bastille
---
glad that trick works for you too.
---
😉 Don't hold your breath on the fix..
---
Yeah, you tell 'em!
---
Edit: HOLY SHIT MY FIRST GOLD!
---
So far only got 1* crap so I wouldn't be too bothered.
---
It's a big obvious target, so people passing through for the quest kill it, and it then has to respawn. When I did the quest, I found the dead body on the way up, but caught it live on the way back down.
---
My gt is UnblestBiscuit. I'm on almost every night!
---
Looking at all of their posts, barely anyone of them have ever posted here.  They just want another notch on their belt.
---
Get mutated and live with it.
---
Thanks for clarifying, I did think that's what it meant, just wasn't 100% sure.
---
I think they should make it optional or part of the helmet
---
I know what you mean, kinda sucks when you have to constantly server hop to get what you need.
---
I did a pretty good chunk of damage with a bloodied super sledge
---
Just have to watch out for falling off / into the damn cabin lol. I did that once. Guess who greeted me at the door.
---
On the top floor of the taxidermy shop is a big pinboard with string linking stuff togeather, such as you would see in an old police drama. There are four notes on that board that give side quests.
---
Definitely something along the lines of of explosive legendary and two shot. The soda fizz as you described it is the sound those weapons make when silenced. Most likely a Two shot exploding shotgun.
---
But in an actual suit, it is part of the suit.
---
I think vaccinated is broken as well. Until recently I never got a disease at rank 3 but now it is almost constant that if I fight a diseased enemy I catch something.
---
Sorry if this is a woooosh but I can’t tell if your being sarcastic or not. You can’t tell if someone is serious now a days in the internet.
---
I can confirm it was working at my camp brewing station last night for rad ant lager and fermentable rum.  XB1 Platform

Everyone
---
I have a character at 15 endurance and infection rate seems to be less than 50% for me. Just sip from the sulphur fountain in whitesprings if you catch something you do not like.
---
FYI, glowing diseased enemies can make you sick from radiation damage. That is how you get diseased without being touched.

Sounds like you need a regular team. Are you on xbox? I'm always up for a queen fight and I'm on most nights.

Gt Pa3ndr4g0n. Hit me up.

I couldn't get violent night after 6-7hours last night. Like wtf!

This is my build. It’s an optimized HW/explosive low health build. Note that there’s a LOT of perks I swap in and out situationally- I have starched genes, but you will almost never take enough rad damage in PA to need it for damage protection- I just equip it when I take rad-away. 
---
I’m on PC so with Perk Loadout Manager, swapping sets of perks takes a second or two. So I’ve got a lot of presets for exploration, crafting, etc.
---
Wait so we can hold Bethesda accountable for every problem in our daily lives now but we can’t be mad at mods who suck? Gotta love when people who love to criticize can’t take any
---
Gamers are so entitled... God damn!
---
I have done it one time. Got a two star unyielding combat armor chest piece. Decent pull.
---
I think that was if you nuke the location first.

‘Preciate you, Fritz! It’s been really fun so far.

I am so sick of shit not being in patch notes, they tried to get away with it with the top hats but were shamed into adding it...  the purpose of the patch notes is transparency, I don't even care if they leave dev notes, just put the changes made in the patch notes, it's not that hard.  intentionally, or accidentally if you believe Bethesda, leaving changes out of patch notes is shady af...

We’re telling Bethesda what we want. They barely have anything faction related. My last post was on hot about Bethesda adding New songs to the radio.
---
So often I find myself saying “Well, In FFXIV ....” when playing FO76.  
---
So many great ideas- FFXIV is almost a perfect MMO for so many reasons.  IMO obviously .  
---
Well, in FFXIV you can see what other player’s gear is when they approach you! Why can’t FO76 do that???

My boy fucking *melted* it with an explosive gattling plasma

Yeah just checked my quad say and it's at 25 damage.. wth

Well, they literally said:

"All PS4 games originally published on or after April 1, 2018 have been developed to support the online ID change feature but, they have not been specifically tested with the online ID change feature and we do not guarantee that they are fully compatible with the feature."
---
So I appreciate the post on confirmation that there were indeed no issues.
---
What are you playing on?
---
I still think the other player won. I mean you created a new account because of 300caps? Like what were you even blowing up a little garden shack? When I destroy golf club turret bases I always get 4 digit bounties, this is just pathetic :)
---
gt phishntrips online 6-pm est - 10 during the week and a good majority of time on weekend.

Sounds like it might not be too bad.  2+ players or soloable if you are really good in their own words.  Either way, exciting if they are adding this kind of content to the game!
---
Ooo that’s good to know about the radiation. I’d happily keep going to the sulphur fountain but I’d be there every 5 mins to get rid of Rad/Blood Worms
---
👍👍👍 also magazine and comic book cover posters!
---
You can literally Google "fallout 76 builds" and find tons of info. I don't think I can link anything in here, they flag everything. I believe there's a subreddit too exclusively for builds.
---
Ahh I’ll have to do that with starched genes. When using this for the first time, I was completely forgetting about swapping so I was using up all my space for crafting perks.
---
This is not safe! You need someone in the same local area as your stuff. Repeat, this is not safe. It may have worked this time but it does not guarantee future results.

find out yourself.

Wow!.. Thats huge guys!.. No more circling map to get some caps.. Thank you BETH :) lots of hugh to you devs

Agreed with your Reddit, I said to complain about repair kits and was called a C word (last time I said that in the comments I was banned from commenting or posting here a week so fuck that)
---
Do you have pictures? I’m a bit confused what you mean.
---
Works for me. Just got a proc off lead champagne and rad ant lager.
---
Gimme all the Trapper gear. I'm in.
---
Are you saying they aren't already doing this? Then what is the point of using it over photomode?
---
Seriously. I've played the One Violent Night event every day (sometimes multiple times a day) for months because it's very fun. And yesterday was the first time that it didn't trigger...very suspicious...
---
Me too, but for Fireproof.
---
The global challenges run out eventually.  I'm just over 1300 hrs now and pretty much only have the ones remaining that require killing 1000+ robots with a certain weapon type left.  I don't bother getting most of the standard stocked items/outfits but when things like Blackbird paint or Camo Bundle came out I snatched them up and they take big chunks of Atoms.
---
Terrible. Useless. Worst gun ever. I'll remove this burden from you for a small price.
---
If you use a bloodied weapon with unyielding armor and add Radicool and Nerd Rage you can be pretty much the biggest glass cannon out there.  I only have 1 rank of nerd rage but i keep Serendipity lvl 3 and whatever the agility is that will use a stimpack if you're below 30% to keep me from dying all the time.
---
Just did another event, died once. Realized I was in Excavator PA. Didn't care and the OP group that showed up mopped the floor with that shaggy robo monster. Another 3* and got a mask.
---
It’s for looking badass.
---
You've known about this issue for months. It was marked low-pri or won't fix. Stop pretending.
---
I wonder how many more times this will be suggested on this subreddit until they actually do it
---
the next quest update in May obviously
---
Yes, where the CAMP device is placed affects where you (and others) spawn in. Move it around in your base to find your sweet spot.

I want a brotherhood flagpole.

It's not a big ask

I don’t get the hate either

Good luck w/school. This place can get pretty toxic
---
Shame there is no Gift system like ESO has otherwise many here would meet you ingame and Gift you Atoms. 
---
I hope things work themselves out eventually and you get Atoms.

QA definitely caught this and flagged it. It was most likely marked as low-pri or won't fix due to their release schedule.
---
Personally, I like the idea of these additions to the Shop. I don’t have a problem buying add-ons for games I play, as I consider it an additional expense in my entertainment budget. Imo, if some people don’t like the additions, then maybe they shouldn’t purchase them. Why try to ruin something that other people will enjoy, simply because you don’t enjoy the premise of it?
---
I think you mean the suckers. Don't get me wrong I love the overall game, but wow do they make some mind blowingly stupid QOL choices. I keep thinking someday we're going to have to put those protest signs to use.

I'd personally like a clean looking excavator paint job.  Jet black, gun metal grey, fuschia, whatever... Just not covered in dirt and bones. Inspecting any of my excavator parts now shows them as the new ugly raider hybrid I dislike and didn't even buy.
---
It depends how do you like to play. Bloodied builds for rifles works nice and you can choose different playstyles (VATS, stealth, commando or spider, hibryd), and with unyielding and bolstering armor pieces it can survive pretty every situation. Remember to pick serendipity in luck tree, and some serums like adrenal reaction and marsupial
---
It can be done. Sorta. But it requires a lot of the right perks and a team and never leaving your feiends side and also probably a buttload of radaway. And it will take up half your build. 
---
Just suck it up and put on the power armor. Seriously.
---
More likely a glitch pre-rendering an area that isn't supposed to show yet. I think we can all agree that while the game is good and fun. The programmers are obviously overworked at Bethesda
---
 They mess stuff up with every patch. Getting better, but still. Stop scrapping my bulk!

I'm not wrong because i'm simply posting was read on this sub so many times. Getting tired of seen the same thing posted over and over on this sub.

Plus, it makes no difference that the photo is taken with the camera or the old photo mode.
---
Seriously.  I mean what FFXIV did (after making a horrible,  hard-to-play MMO and then rebooting it) was understand that the game has to be easy to get into for a lot of people to want to play it. 
---
I really hope they have a cross-server party finder system, otherwise, math is not in our favor. I can't imagine trying to get 4 people to grind a dungeon when the whole server only has 24 people total. 
---
And I'm not really interested in trying to lock in schedules for 3 other people to do a dungeon. I just want to log in, check the box, and go AFK for a few minutes while the game matches me with others.
---
I have a lvl.40 BE LMG that I would love to upgrade to lvl.50.  I think when prestiging comes around we'll also want the ability to downgrade levels on gear.

You need an assultron recall card

I have about 40, because I do spend them. Never paid for atoms in the game but I've probably earned and spent a couple thousand (mostly on camp items). Just bought the red stove last night :)

Yeh some bullshit when you cannot get the event sometimes.

It’s generally the how over the what people take issue with posts like this.

I’m getting on rn

Weird. The Party Boy/Girl change was purely a wording on the card, it never worked with the new drinks for me. Could just be some bad luck
---
I did that. All the info is from when the game first came out. All the builds are from November last year and obviously balance changes have happened. That is why I'm asking here.,

Yep. Can get them when it's not for a challenge. Typical!

It's probably illegal in Japan because of the past with the bombs and all and the fact Bethesda's F team is based in USA. So for the Japanese versions, maybe they could rename Atoms to Fukus in honor of Fukushima and Fuku would be a more direct response to your query.
---
The problem I have with it is them saying the atom store would only contain cosmetic items and everything else would be released in game. I'm 110% down for items like these but to release them in game like they originally said. I'm just tired of all the lying the company has done with 76 from the bags, nuka dark, hidden patches and now this. If they would have stated in the get go "hey the Atom store will contain a variety of items" then I'd be cool with it. I've played ESO and have bought items from the in game store on there.
---
Totally agree.
---
I wouldn't call a 5 minute video a commercial. Promotional video sure, but a 5 minute commercial has never been shown for anything.
---
Was noticeable before. Haven't observed it since patch. PS4.
---
I hope they did it to... for the immersion.
---
This plus twisted muscle/talons depending on melee type and adrenal reaction.
---
What platform
---
And, where are you trying to build them?
---
Just wondering if anyone here's tried buying ATOM Cards in the US, and just shipping/gifting the code electronically.
---
They added this to vendor screens in this week's patch. I'm not sure if it's working in player screens or not, but your request may have already been answered or coming soon.
---
Got 2 identical cloaking wood chests from the event 2 nights in a row. The odds of that should be ridiculously low.
---
Oh my god yes! It is so annoying jumping super high when im trying to attach a wire. Sometimes i have to connect it the other way and it works.
---
Meat Hook is, in my opinion the best melee weapon. It does indeed count as 1h and unarmed which means you can maximize damage or use fewer perk slots for comparable damage in favor of more utilities.
---
I have been using all three melee variants and tbh, it's all the same. Just choose what you like the most. 
---
I can guarantee that the definition of "best" will change as time goes on. Balance patches, new builds, and new content will likely change alot. This games endgame is very open to just having all 3 as options.
---
Yep, my way is to reject the event then murder everyone, I have a Gauss, bloodied explosive, that one shots people, and full ass/sentinel build, so I just stand there, VATS, and Gun fu everyone in the event in like 3 seconds flat. Its pure ecstasy.
---
I didn't think the stim pack perk worked when you are already below that threshold? If not I already have several unyealding items banked (leather and misc 1\* items) but I also have the barbarian, evasive, white knight perks and I am working on others. I can shift to serendipity. How glass cannot are you? Can you get attacked at West Tek for example with 6+ mobs attacking and not worry much?
---
It would help player vending too since the stores won't disappear when a player logs off.
---
There is a very similar bug on PS4 as well. Sometimes freezing lasts for 30 seconds. Today’s hot fix didn’t fix either
---
I’ve lived here all my life and you speak better than me brother 😂
---
2k caps to make a new recall card then server hop until you find one that isn't on cooldown. Because what players really wanted was needlessly spending money, cooldowns and more server hopping.
---
Actually I think they fixed that so to throw you have to hold the button
---
Yep a Putz is a do gooder, makes me sick.
---
Huh I wonder if it has to do with read trading rights between America and Japan
---
Vampire Cryolator for the win!
---
Nobody knows. Unless you see it coming from an official Bethesda source, its pure speculation.
---
ye or when your trying to trade with simeone lol
---
I can 3-4 shot most Mirelurk Queens with power attacks so I really like the Instigating Super Sledge but I see alot of melee using 1h weapons so I wanted to ask to see if Im missing something. I have a pretty nice 3* anti armor swork with swing speed banked but havent ranked up my 1h perks all the way yet so I havent tried it out.
---
&gt; We’ve received lots of requests for Repair Kits, and we’re excited to add them in the weeks following Patch 8.
---
I haven’t gone to west two in a little while but with a bloodied buzz blade I usually only get hit once at Whitesprings. Gotta love a 200% repair bloodied very fast weapon.
---
Melee is powerful regardless of 1H, 2H or unarmed. 
---
The choice between 2H and the rest is simply whether you can tolerate slow attacks, but wow do they hit hard. 
---
Unarmed is great, but there aren't great unarmed options in power armor, so you may need a backup when the rads are unbearable. 
---
Reportedly the meat hook uses unarmed and 1H perks, but I haven't had a good one drop to test that. You really don't need more perks. You can one-shot everything without more than +10-20% from perks, if you get your strength high enough. 
---
You didn't mention it, so I'd suggest you look into mutations. **Twisted muscles** is a must for all melee. **Talons** is great if you're doing unarmed. **Adrenal reaction** is a must if you're doing anything bloodied. 
---
I'm generally looking at 700-1,000 damage per swing at level 50, which is a Nocturnal Deathclaw gauntlet at night, or a Bloodied Pole Hook during the day. Both have swing speed. The gauntlet is faster, while the pole hook has some reach.   
---
Beyond that, everything /u/xmap_215 said. **Unyielding armor** is crazy good and fun. Low health builds are powerful, but you do have to expect to die from time-to-time when you're living on the edge.
---
Yeah I think they should have skins with loads of junk strapped on like a pack brahmin.  One skin for Excavator PA and another skin for Raider PA (lvl 15 mules lol)
---
But if you have a camp near enough to an owned workshop...
---
I live in a redneck hellhole, all patriotic and 'MURICAN and shit, yet someone who's main language isn't even English outclasses them so easily. People here call "Oil" "Eiarl". How does someone fuck up that bad when the only language they even bother learning is English.
---
Make it a quest to get them printed! Need to get special photo printer online for something, and then you get to print photos (because the voting printers are just dot-matrix printers, so you can't just use any printer you find...)
---
I mean maybe, but I don't see what a Scout quest line has to do with the Sheepsquatch. Can't help but feel adding Sheepsquatch would've made more sense with, you know... the Sheepsquatch quest? But I guess all we can do is wait and see, I'm sure it'll make sense in the end.
---
I haven’t tried that one. Will do
---
Well I just want to say I may have hit some nerves here. Not my intention. I appreciate the constructive feedback. I agree I need to hoard less. But as I said I wouldn’t mind a little more.
---
I don’t agree with having all plants available in your garden - I think it’ll flood the game with chems and muck up the in game economy.
---
BUT. It is too hard to find some of these bastards right now. Often by the time I’ve tracked down a plant my other ingredients have spoiled. Definitely cooking anything more than wood + meat is just not worth it, especially given how fast food spoils.
---
 You can kind of get around this by googling plant locations but this is un-fun and ruins immersion. 
---
My answer would be to keep the list of plants you can grow at your camp limited but greatly increase the number of wild plants so they’re not so damn hard to track down.
---
Alternately have some sort of in-game tracking ability, where you can flag an ingredient you need within the recipe/crafting menu and it gives you a general location on the map where you can find it.
---
Sometimes i wish this would comme true so people would stop asking for it several times per week on this sub since release of the game.
---
iirc enemies usually have similar energy and ballistic resistance values.  But firearms can benefit from perks that help punch through the ballistic resistance.  Energy weapons lack this, and do not make up for it with greater sheer damage output.
---
Sounds kind of fun.
---
I saw this got downvoted. I doubt you meant simply “just live with it”, but we’re more implying get the Mutation Plague Walker so you can better deal with it.
---
I personally noticed about 2 months ago that I had suddenly gained an almost 100% infection rate if I come in contact with molerats/rats or any creature labeled as “diseased”. 
---
Having played a lot the two months prior I did notice I rarely needed a disease cure. They were piling up. I’m an up close Melee/Heavy Gun build too. Then patch 4-5 roles around and I’m running out of Disease Cures and am constantly being infected. 
---
So yeah without much proof short of hundreds of hours of gameplay.. I would definitely say something did change. Glad I’m not the only one to notice.
---
thanks for this, really appreciate the confirmation. i was starting to feel nuts because every time i server hopped at harpers ferry, it was either heavy combat arms or nothing.
---
but today, after i saw your response, i stuck with it and eventually got the torso and the legs at harpers. thanks again.
---
I acknowledge that you’re tired and frustrated :) 
---
Imo, it would make sense from a business perspective for them to include the mentioned additions within the game, as well as having them available for purchase for those too lazy to hunt them down. I’m not one for speculating development, as I understand that things consistently change from what was initially pitched. Given the vitriol from some fans, I can’t blame them for not being specific about what they’re going to include, how those additions will be implemented or what the exact terms for those additions are.
---
I've seen reports that double / quad versions of this weapon can load more shots, dramatically increasing its damage. Can anyone confirm?
---
It's weird it's still missing. It's been a while.
---
Why? Correlation does not mean causation. Shouldn't we credit the Republicans since acceptance only really took off as they gained more seats?
---
The only thing can help now is sending support ticket. But i wonder why you cant purchase it.
---
It nice to have people like you, too.
---
Catching diseases, alcoholism and various addiction problems, i log on to escape reality not to relive it
---
Exactly. Was looking for this in the update but they didn't say anything. 50 photos is not nearly enough especially with this new camera coming out. I don't see why they couldn't make it like 1k limit or something
---
I must have missed seeing that,  I will have to make a return trip next time I am online. Thanks!
---
Bottom set of photos looks like a flawed comparison as the lower level one has exploding bullets.   
---
Question, are you a adrenal/Classfreak build?
---
I've just pretty much accepted that I will always have bone worms, rad worms, and the blight.  I don't even disease cure it anymore. Whatever.
---
okay thanks, now it's completely clear :-)
---
Exactly,  just dont go suicidal while carry all of your bulked junk because you will die with this build.  It’s high risk high reward.  I’ve healed up after a nuke zone and then intentionally stand on cars to blow them up before going to sell things since unyielding increases all SPECIAL except Endurance.
---
Was this meant to be in response to someone else? I'm not seeing how it relates to my question.
---
I have been saving every legendary item that drops for a few weeks now on some miles. I might see if I have a hook and try it out. I know I have a few decent three star melee weapons in there so maybe I’ll get lucky. I’ll look into adrenal reaction and talons. I already have twisted muscles. Also need to find more unyealding pieces. Thanks for the help.
---
I posted similar and agree it sucks
---
On foundations ... i have my camp near a water source at White Springs.. the foundations are not even in the water
---
I usually play with a mic and forget to pull the mic down on my headphones, I just forget most times since I don't hear many others talk. Lots of emoji use though which I like when briefly teaming up
---
\+1 still cant put purchased mods on my PA
---
It's not really there. That's why your long haired character's hair can swing right through it.
---
Yeah, it's pretty horrible looking. And so is the helmet which is why it's a semi big deal. The neck could be a third optional piece.
---
At least the suit without helmet doesn't look as bad as the helmet without the suit.
---
I'm probably assuming too much; but can you clarify whether you're looking for survival (PVP) meta or adventure (PVE) meta? two very different things.
---
Two shot has not been modifying the damage for a number of weapons, like the Broadsider...  
---
Can't figure out if it's a display glitch or core DMG
---
Vampire cryolater with 25% faster reload and 90% reduced weight . Been saving that thing for stuff like this.
---
It’s hard for me to explain. There are two types of stairs and the new skin applies to both. But only the single one can be bought while the other one (the one I wanted) cannot. I’m wondering why it isn’t included with the 500 atoms I paid. Is it being sold separately? Idk
---
I wouldn't consider that "design," I doubt any design went into it. More likely management asked how can we quickly add this feature and a programmer said I can put it here, and they said OK.
---
It is supposed to work that way... Don't know if they fixed it. Saved it for this reason... Will let you know.
---
2000 caps. I won't even pay that for a PA mod.
---
Sorry I didn't see your original post. I had a search to see if anyone else had already bought it up. 
---
Playing "Shear Terror" has probably damaged my ability to find things when they're right in front of my face :p
---
i had no problem being the conduit for all 3 and still getting my hit in to count for the loot, but I guess it might help some people
---
&lt;shakes fist at monitor&gt;
---
I killed the sbq and the event failed most likely case is just a shit show of bugs
---
i just wanna talk to someone in fo76
---
Same story for me. I’m on XB1
---
I think seeing items that are already in the game turn up as plans with dlc is a hint of things to come! Lol the bone worrior skin is siiick!
---
Yeah There is even a few tapes with different cryptid stories on them, so yeah sugar grove is definitely connected ..... somehow
---
They could if they used a VPN. I bought the game for 12$ as a Europe only code even though I live in America. Used a VPN to redeem the code. There are tons of free ones that will work.
---
Can a single player be the conduit for all 3 pylons at once?
---
If so what does that do to their HP?
---
I am replying to this with the assumption you are a lower level player. Lots of effective weapons and attack strategies for this enemy.  If you want to build specifically for scorched ( which I don't recommend) and you go with guns, find a gun you can put a prime receiver or barrel on.  It does bonus damage to Scorchbeasts., but the ammo type becomes Ultracite, which requires Ultracite and flux to fabricate and neither are exactly easy to come by. I went with melee early on, so getting it on the ground and crippling it was the main thing.  I recommend a good shotgun w/ Enforcer perk for that.  Lots of people forget that you can block their attacks and take lots of damage before they kill them. I can kill them with 2-3 hits on average, but I'm high level and have a specialized build and weapons for melee. When I was at a much lower level I had lots of trouble getting them to land and they would just wear you out. I finally got a hold of a decent shotgun with some range to it and it got better. This has been my experience and have faced off with multiple scorchbeasts simultaneously many times.  I've also seen other players take on multiples with their rifles and do just as well.
---
It is weird split beans aren't there.
---
Raider and any type of merc gear!
---
How much?
---
The title sounded more like "Jimmy! You better have that bedroom cleaned by the time I count to five!"
---
Country flags would be nice too. I don’t get why we didn’t get a swiss flag with fasnacht day.
---
Didn’t experienced any trouble after changing my PSN name. So change it asap ;)
---
Wha? It is a flippin robot. How does a syringer work on it at all?
---
what would u offer?
---
Okay they did fix the stacking at least. Can easily one shot a lvl 40 mole Miner at 20x reloads vs hitting it at 5x only takes off about a fifth of it's damage. Will have to try it again later with pistol perks and such
---
Do you have a picture of it?
---
Absolutely, especially a kitchen sink lol
---
nah why
---
Yes and it wrecks it very quickly
---
Crap I'm on xbox. Sorry :( hope someone can make you one.
---
Accessing the terminal doesn't make the Quest Marker disappear... Pretty confusing... 🤪
---
I don't have any interest in PvP at all. It's not survival. I should have been clearer on that. Just co-op with a few buddies.
---
There's the small wall mounted one..
---
Ohhhhhhh shit I just went into my camp and checked. I totally see what you mean now. When I bought the regular stairs, the platform stairs weren’t pictured so I never even thought to look.
---
*Dang Bethesda Get on me wishlist!*
---
Same here.. I only experience it during the Encrypted Event, pretty annoying. PS4 here btw
---
It got so ridiculous I just quit paying attention to them. Certain ones like rattle hands , I think that's what it is anyway. The one that lowers my gun damage, I use them if I get that. Idgaf about the rest.
---
I want a big one like how the american flag is. The wall mounted one just looks cheesy.
---
One.......
---
I wold love even a useful chainsaw. One that works without the temp buff from overcharging it.
---
I’ve started doing the same. I just ignore but it’s sad because it takes away part of the game, even if it is a negative thing.
---
I get the idea it's dumb one shotting Bots who can't fight back for loot. But what is even the point of the city now? Just a quest zone and then that's it? Dumb design decisions compounded by dumb fixes... GJ Bethesda...
---
Hey, no problem. It's dropped into the 'not on the front page' abyss now anyway, so you post can carry the baton :D
---
I don't see why it's not a thing, but also the game is in America..
---
I believe that Calvin was field-testing prototype (shielded) Assaultron upgrades. The Sheepsquatch legend was a convenient cover. Calvin tried to get frisky with the Assaultron, it went off the range and, well, followed it's programming: act like a Sheepsquatch. Or at least, Calvin's idea of how one would act. Kind of like..."Harry and the Hendersons" meets "Ex Machina." Only sexier!(?)
---
Bonus, the company "Bysshe" and it's link To Percy Bysshe Shelley's themes of glimpses into a hidden supernatural world, and (more pertinent) his wife, Mary Shelley's own "Frankenstein" are unlikely coincidences.
---
Yeah I'm hoping stealth will be a viable option for the burrows, that way I can run it solo.
---
Heck, some workshops are probably large enough to place artillery on one side and shell the other.
---
The Marine Combat Helmet does. The Tactical one is just a wetsuit mask and is too small to incorporate a gas mask.
---
It was like that in 4 and I never had a problem with it.
---
Possibly if you hit her with every single bullet and she is always within range for max damage. If she is too far away your damage falls off. Distance of the SBs' can be annoying when they are flying.
---
I'm level 188, seems great to me.
---
This is a good idea but all these different systems are complicating crafting and making everything buggy! Lol I'm down for simplicity!
---
Huh... so YOU GUYS are the reason my camp won't always spawn in!
---
I like that you even made a visual. Most people don't really think about the suggestions too much.
---
A lot of modern countries didn't exist at the time of the great war, also..
---
Yeah I’ve started to ignore them. After whichever patch it was that changed the infection rate I used like 8 disease cures in a few hours. After that I figured it was just a waste. 
---
It takes away from the survival aspect of the game and just makes it tedious
---
Apology accepted. See you out there, Wastelander.
---
Anyone else want to decorate their camps after raiders? Just me?
---
if you're right, you will change my life.
---
Yup, been running one for a few weeks now
---
Xbox 1. It happens specifically on the xbox 1x for me.
---
I got a recipe for a special assaultron head after the event, but how/where do I build it? I have searched every work bench. Is it just a mod for the assaultron head weapon? Cause someone mentioned they've seen people ear it...
---
Now that I am thinking about it, this was karma. I accidentally murdered a level 8 a few nights ago
---
I love that you took me mentioning runes in context of additional loot categories, out of everything there, to point out they don't have prefixes or suffixes, which I never said. 
---
Diablo 2 DOES NOT HAVE GUARANTEED DROPS. 
---
Act bosses are indeed weighted to drop high end items more often. 
---
But the TC that drop is generated from has a range of 3-4 levels (can't remember which) 
---
Which means that boss can pop an item that is not of the highest quality of it's possible drop from that TC. 
---
Regardless of difficulty. Item generation uses the same process. Chooses TC, chooses item type, chooses quality (that's when it also takes into account your MF)
---
Just wait till you figure put you can't choose what card to rank up when you are making duplicates too!
---
As a person who plays with a hoarder mentality, I fully support this.
---
Here are some strategies that help with connecting wires.
---
* Try aiming at the exact location a wire is connecting even though the whole object is already highlighted.
---
* If it fails try connecting it the reverse way.
---
* Don't place connectors near corners.
---
* Invisible polygons can interfere with connecting, like the invisible ramps created by tall foundations.
---
* Something could be blocking your LOS even if you can't see it, try moving to a different location.
---
See, think about it.
---
3 cards, 1 * each, for 30% extra damage. Each additional star gives you 5% more.
---
Instead invest in stabilized and adrenaline and tenderizer and suppressor. You'll get a much higher output of damage overall.
---
it's drains it 3 times as fast as one does but i have a ton of stimpacks and 90%reduced chem weight  and i make way more stims in like 10 min then i use in this event
---
👀 you need to chill homie
---
I can buzz through West Tec at 15-30% health and haven't died there yet (though I've come close). For defense perks I'm using Barbarian 3 (Str), Nerd Rage 3 (Int), Dodgy 3 (Ag), and Serendipity 3 (Lck). I also have 10 points in endurance along with some ranks in lifegiver 3 for a little HP padding. 
---
I don't run white knight. I run Fix it good instead, though I wish I could do both. There's just not enough room for everything.
---
Nope. Sony claims any game published after april of 2018 shouldn't be effected at all, but you never know. Even so, i changed my name and havent had any problems.
---
Would a Two-shot make a difference?  Does the freeze effect attach to the second projectile as well?
---
Yup. I've had to rely on the RNGods for random drops of lower-tiered cards from packs. Just grind a couple hundred more levels and you might end up with what you want...
---
Oh shit i was gpnna say thats the beauty of having dupes..but i didnt even know this.
---
I hate the perk card packs, I've got so many duplicates of useless cards in them. Would be better if we could swap them with other players, seeing as they're meant to be trading cards anyway!!
---
My stimpak use was insane but I think a lot of that came down to:
---
1. I was the only player in my corner of event so I was often the sole target for a dozen robots &amp; Mr Gutsys can burn through HP like nothing on earth.
---
2. I was panic spamming the stimpak hotkey more than I needed to.
---
It's very good for a rifleman. Hands down.
---
It works on everything well, out of the box, without penalty. 
---
I carry an Instigating lever for PvE non-boss mobs or to start fights, an Executioner's lever for ending fights/counter-bloodied build PvP, and an AA lever for general shenanigans in PvE/PvP.
---
Bloodied builds reign supreme for DPS, but do require some gear and consumable management.
---
Until, you need to remove an authenticator... GOOD LUCK. and the Mog Station is garbage.
---
Weird you mention this. Me and my bud nuked whitesprings last night. Empty server more or less. Killed everything and nothing respawned at all. We gave up and logged off in end. Is there an issue with spawns?
---
https://youtu.be/33-VuvmquUI
---
I know it’s only a display glitch for the broadsider and Missile launcher. Ive both anti armor and a two shot for both and tested them out on the same enemies. Two shot trumped it in damage even though it only showed 1 more.
---
My theory is this 1 is the direct impact only and not what the game considers “explosion damage”, but I could be wrong. My own tests suggest that it is boosting the core damage though. 
---
As for the SAH, I have no idea. It’s so wildly inconsistent that it’ll take some time to try side by side testing. But I will see if I can get some useful test runs in this weekend
---
Ah man i cant even remember, its been ages since ive played this game and i know theyve done a number of changes to unyielding since the last time i did this
---
Haven't finished all the side quests come with the new patch (I mean those quests you got from different train stations), so probably I don't have all the information, but yesterday I've done one which took you to Site Alpha to hunt down a Yao Guai. The journals you found through the quest indicate that Yao Guai was created by mixing gene from bovine into a bear... which leads me to think the real Sheepsquatch may also be a result of such experiment.
---
There are no meta builds outside of DPS and DPS/Utility. Until we get more challenging content it's unlikely to change.
---
You got the point. Since you get diseased over and over again, just accep it. Get the right mutation from the Enclave and turn diseases as an extra attack.
---
Got you confused in this conversation with another this one has nothing to do with scumboxhorn.
---
Todd Howard said it at the 2018 e3 interview he did that it was an all hands on deck with everyone workingnon fo76 o get it out when they did.
---
Still, there last 2 quests start by finding a poster. Without a basic suggestion on where to search how are you going to find it. "There is a new quest in Appalachia and it starts by reading a poster, good luck finding it"
---
Wait...That thing is a weapon? I thought it was junk! ...What?!
---
Yes I've done the same.. I felt bad but left their aid for them to re collect atleast.
---
That’s... really bad though. I’d hope with some perks it would do better, otherwise thats terribly inefficient.
---
Theoretically a max 20 charge quad with my perk set up would do 1740.
---
Wishing I hadn’t sold the quad one that I had now. Would like to see if it’s any good vs bigger enemies
---
Haha No worries. His English is crazy impressive.
---
100% this. 99% of craftable food and drink I look at and think' yeah, that would be cool, but no chance am I going to run around collecting all those ingredients before they spoil.' Which these days is in about 12 minutes.
---
Let this guy chuckle with his nuka grenade. It's cool.
---
It might be. I can see the loopholes associated with it but you can exploit any system. Even the economy.
---
Worked like a charm! Got a legendary yaoguai first try.
---
The freeze effect is on crits. I dont think a second immediate crit would even do anything in that regard. Would hurt more though obviously.
---
Where do I spend the caps?  Where do I buy the card?
---
Literally every plant on earth can be cultivated by humans. We are smart as fuck bro.
---
Bethesda fiddling where they shouldn't
---
No harm in facing the music. Nuka grenade was worth it. All part of the game
---
Why? What are you losing by people enjoying both game modes? They have survival only challenges with unique weapon rewards that everybody is entitled to earn. I think it would be cool to lock characters in if you had to make new ones, but as it stands now, that just wouldn't work.
---
It's definitely a bug, it has harsh edges which you can see in the little bit of green grass at the bottom
---
Don't waste your moneys to Atoms. This game has no future anymore. FO76 is already dying and even the most fanatic fans have hard time to believe anymore to this game or make more lies about brighter future. Use your money to the new games which are using latest techniques. FO76 uses almost 10 year old engine, which can't be upgraded anymore.
---
After all the duping bugs are definitely fixed so they'll actually be rare
---
I can definitely help you but i need to know your preferences, or if you don't have any i can just give you on of my op builds, some are great for pve other for pvp there is couple options kinda working in both scenario.
---
Yeah I realized that this data isn’t the best in terms of apples to apples comparison so I wanted to make the new post with a more even comparison.
---
I don’t use adrenal reaction though so these are all standard damage values pre and post patch.
---
Pretty sure I had bloody mess on each time too.
---
I love it when devs leave the community to find out a mystery, like Bungie does with raids and secrets like Whisper of the Worm (Black Spindle from D1) and a mystery quest in Black Armory.
---
Make a literal kitchen sink stuck into the chest piece somehow and Im sold
---
I've noticed some waste site zones randomly at times have nuked flora.
---
I've always quite enjoyed figuring this one out for myself although I have a sheet just for the junk you needn't bulk in order to sell. With CHA maxxed out some of those just about make it from 1c to 2c or 2 to 3. The price calc is done on an integer unit basis and then multiplied x the amount which loses you up to almost half of the possible total price.

I doubt that's the cause unless someone really screwed up. They can disable legendaries at different locations so there was no need to nerf the robot legendary rate map wide. For example, have you ever seen a legendary super mutant at Sommersville? I'm guessing it's just a case of confirmation bias and bad/unlucky RNG. I don't farm legendaries but I will make a lap around town when I'm down there and look for one. I've had times where I've went several trips without seeing a single legendary. Other times, I've had a 50% legendary rate.
---
Oof that’s bad man. What level is it? I assume that’s with no perks?
---
damn GG dude
---
Up Vote and ‘same’ comment.
---
Should have done my research! Sadly the combat helmet is the only piece I can't seem to snag the plans for. And while the mask may be too small to incorporate a gas mask I would assume it would have some filtering mechanics for airborne toxins to an extent. Either way I definitely need to find those plans now! Thanks for the info 👍
---
all that sounds like Bethesda's problem as they created the problems, not us fans of the game, and why shouldnt people discuss the issues with the game?
---
I know what you are talking about. You are tallimg about assassins Sentinal and assassins cavalier. I made a post recently you can look at that explains why they are NOT not broken and not godlike.
---
Yeah I'd be down for that. Adds another layer of flavour that's been in the older fallout titles.
---
You are complaining about snow? Is this a bad thing? Everyone last week said they wanted new weather, so what’s the problem?
---
that's what I was hoping
---
we'll see I guess
---
Listen to this. was just at whitesprings golf club (PC) so i do my normal routine.. knock on the front door with my running chainsaw.  Which usually summons the whole golf club worth of ghoulies up and out the stairs. I run into the tennis court where I proceed to run around in circle chainsaw'n their knees..  I happen to die and upon dying i literally watch this horde of 10 or so glowing ones all die as if God smited them from heaven.  Go into the club with another person.. we seeing glowing ghoulies dead standing and in their starting positions.
---
This has been consistently requested since early launch. Why isn't this a thing yet? Give us at lease 2 "Decks" or something, similar to WoW spec system where you can have 2 different specs for your character switching them out while out of combat.
---
Still, it would be nice for them to bring back the limited and removed items for Japan if/when people can buy atoms there. Selfishly I’d love to see them bring everything back briefly worldwide if this happens, but Japan and other regions impacted for sure should have a fair shake at buying the higher priced options. 
---
If they can’t, then it would be nice if they adjusted the cost of things in the shop for Japan so that things like limited time bundles and such are attainable with the earned atoms from dailies/weeklies. They wouldn’t be getting cash either way in this scenario but they’d end up with happy customers.
---
my god this sub is really going down the toilet, OP has a sane, rational idea to help the game out, and people are just shitting all over him for it
---
i think i need to go over to filthy casuals sub and never look back
---
Bigger question may be while the sledge does good damage, is it fast enough to deal with a mob?  If not, what do you change to when mobbed?
---
I'm L57 with a 1 hand melee build.  15 Str, including incisor3, martial art3, bloodymess1, gladiator1, glowsight3, tankkiller1, and  tenderizer1
---
But my weapon of choice against a mob is not a legendary, b/c the legendaries are too slow
---
L45 cultist blade is my weapon of choice right now.
---
Vampire machete was my previous goto.  (even took out a L30 Sentrybot with it) :)
---
I try to get a bit of all the things mentioned, bit of flux gathering, then deal to the adds for mass and fluid gathering, then stabbing the bejesus outta any SB that happens to land, but I consider myself a medium tank build that can take a bit if a beating, but is there mainly as a support unit
---
Either this or double down on stimpacks like I have. Take a couple of ranks in First Aid (Intelligence, boosts stimpacks by 15/30/45%) and have Power Armor with the Medic Pump mod in the chest (automatically uses stimpacks when your health is low, around 40-50%). This alone let me be a conduit and tank the Sheepsquatch without dying once, used maybe 13 stims (and the chem that reduces damage taken). I dont even have good Power Armor, just the lowest level of Excavator.
---
The red in a nuke zone can be hard to see on bugs
---
4 and 5 stars
---
Ones I hate most are the Luck cards; I've got a one and a three of all the major scavenging cards (caps, food, meds, ammo) and run with serendipity. Swapping without perk loadout manager means a ton of scrolling way to the right every damned time.
---
People in Alabama are actually great speakers. Too bad the same can't be said about Mississippi and Louisiana. And if Cardi B is a sample of how people speak in the Bronx, then they definitely don't speak English.
---
Chasing the meta will only lead you off a cliff.
---
That's what I've been saying for awhile too.
---
I’ve read 3 hours.
---
furious stats
---
Only new content what Bethesda can create is: Gather more junk and store them to even bigger stash.
---
I'm not gonna downvote you because I agree that I would recommend anyone who wants to play it, if they have a console, stay on there. It's very annoying though, too bad the optimization is a joke.
---
If you are using more than 20 stims as a conduit, you should be DPS. Being the conduit is a role that is best for people who are sneaky or tanky. If you do not have the appropriate healing abilities/equipment or resistances, you should DPS. Let other players know this in game if people are not doing well. It amazed me how few people communicate during these events.
---
How witty and appropriate!
---
Unfortunately, it's not actually snow, it's just the lighting being messed up randomly since the last patch
---
I hope not
---
I am the kind of trader who just drops things on my player vending machine for sale and hope for the best.
---
 I will also hit up other players vending machines when I see them.
---
 The whole going to a different site outside the game finding a player to trade with and meeting up inside the game seems like a giant hassle that I would just rather not do.
---
I have a suppressor's cryolator...that will be helpful, I guess?
---
Yeah, I played it the day it came out and it was insanely glitchy, I had to go to my ps4 home screen and reboot the game app a few times to be able to start it, and save and do that as well when the quest wouldn't show. The crouching stuff happened at that last part when you complete the quest. I'm guessing the recent update screwed up the hotfix.
---
No.  
---
I've said it before, the card system needs to be redone from the ground up.  
---
It's an awful system. Swapping cards, even with "decks", is just not fun nor engaging gameplay, it's trash.
---
Is your endurance low?  Mine is and I have that issue too.  I justcraft disease cures on my own now.
---
They probably need to test those items first/adjust the damage and so forth.
---
Yupp! Thought my game was about to crash when I got it before.
---
Also don't overlook Pipe-Rifles cause they can be modded to pistols. my Mutant slayers exploding pipe rifle turned into one of my number one pistols.
---
I bought one from a vendor inside The Whitespring
---
Probably watoga vendors because I live 9caps away and I can view sold nuke zone legendary items and both mod selections at them.
---
The 'meta' would be 
---
**Weapons:**
---
Bloodied / AA + Explosive / 25% Fire Rate / VATS crit / 40% Swing speed + Something else.
---
**Armor:**
---
Assassin's / Unyielding + Stat / AP Regen + Sentinl / Cavalier
---
Every other legendary is not really worth anything.
---
Yeah, legendary ones don't exist. I'm baffled that they removed flare guns from the legendary drop pool but kept drills and syringers in it
---
I agree with you and we need more players in survival. I've only been on a team of 2 once. It was fun but I do alot of solo pvp and I lost alot of fights n caps before the nerf.. made alot too tho lol!! But ya more conflict and more players would be nice. Waà sont survival said to be geared towards pvp?? I love survival and had to rethink my camp as a team of 2 destroyed it almost entirely lol. Now it's a lil cheaper.. but ya more fighting and more ppl would be nice. It's been hell tryin to cap farm now
---
In power armour with that yellow HUD I can't see places I haven't been to  because it blends to well so I need that change
---
I’m having to guess they’ve been arsing about with the spawns in general....definitely at watoga and I’ve also heard possibly around that new event.
---
Wouldn’t be surprised if they balls it up so much we’ll all be thinking “I knew I shouldn’t have sold that *2 tire iron”
---
So Bethesda is bringing Instagram inside to the game. What we are going to see next? Inside game Tinder? This game is becoming even more joke.
---
That is the idea haha
---
I've only tried it once and I was sneak vats sniping with a bloodied build. I tried activating the pylons since all the full health people in power armour weren't doing it. I didnt realize I would literally be electrocuted to death each time. 10/10 would activate pylons again
---
Holy shit yes please. I have so many cool scenic shots that would be amazing to hang up.
---
Right, he said he won't be buying them in the atom shop cause they will drop. I was correcting him.
---
You learn the Marine Armor Helmet by scrapping one, and the mask by plan. If you are on PC I can teach you to make the Marine Armor Helmet and/or sell you the plan for the Marine Tactical Helmet. IGN: jchamlin
---
Then your girlfriend should definitely try our the new daily quest - Someone To Talk To. Yesterday I got the part where you need to shot a cat with Vox Syringer, which then you'll be able to listen what the cat thinks in human language... Pretty funny, plus there's at least 4 or 5 cat in the quest area, and a lot of dead cat too...
---
I'm thinking they want everybody just to hang around white Springs and never go anywhere else on the map
---
I have no problem with it and my build sucks regardless lol just curious is all
---
Your title is a little demand-ey.
---
Lol. Nope. Every person I know plays the game for loot. There isnt enough content in the game to stay for any other reason. You can go from lvl 1 to killing the SBQ in a week or less and that's the "endgame content".
---
I don't think this is correct. I just think the lack of resistance penetration is an unintended bug. Either the Awareness Perk isn't correcting numerically per effects or anti-armor energy weapons are experiencing an unintentional bug of not "reducing" the armor value.
---
I talked to a super mutant npc.
---
yea i also use the perk that makes the stims work quicker and the perk that makes them give you more hp
---
At this point, do people even check Reddit before posting? After the repair kit debacle I'm feeling duplicate thread fatigue, and this is a subject I've suggested other forums and wholeheartedly support.
---
I can get most of my stuff from my garden, but I usually have to venture out to find an ingredient like Blight or Nuka Cola Quantum. I like that, it lets me explore the world more.
---
Not on PC man. PC people want trade for trade, and they want to get a better deal then they started with. Want a Bloody + Explosive or Bloody + Fire Rate ANYTHING? Better have an equivalent to trade. I really hope the Purveyor evens the playing field, because right now you can spend literally 800 hours farming and only see 2 or 3 of those items at most.
---
Cool idea, but huge Dada problems for shared world.
---
TL;WP your pictures are not textures and would be terrible if used as such.
---
wow the down votes and hate for you being real are exactly why this community turns me off. unreal. kudos for all you've done! good luck and have fun.
---
Closest to me at the time.
---
LFG is a crapshoot. I've made some good sales and have returning clients that just randomly ask for anything, but theres a lot of trash out there too.
---
I agree though, my extra legwork for proof of item doesn't excuse Bethesda for messing it up. I just try to practice good business to compensate.
---
I've only had that experience once tbh.
---
Well, I guess the disconnect between fo3 and NV and 76 would be an interactive radio personality. I always thought that the negative (or positive) karma would be accumulated locally but spread by three dog or mister new vegas as they would report on the stories. 76 sort of has that style of radio personality with Rose but obviously she doesn't fill the same role as the other two.  
---
As for the NPC factions, your karma was independent of alignment. If you were an evil brotherhood of steel character in fo3, you still get evil dialogue responses from paladins and knights. Most of the time it was your companions that were dependant on karma (which this game wouldn't have). The whole purpose of the post was to think of karma as a way to see how certain players interact with each other rather than interactions with the environment (bots, events, etc.)
---
Yeah it seems hazmat or PA regardless. Makes sense
---
They did the water the way they did on purpose, to prevent water farming from being too passive.
---
Let us have a wagon to pull behind us full of stuff...or a pack brahmin follower
---
Yeah I just realized that. I sound like a parent telling Todd to do his chores.
---
This still doesn't really reward the support players though. I'd rather everyone get a reward than hope that Bethesda can make a system that properly works. Heck, the SBQ still doesn't drop loot half of the time even when I'm the one who drops the nuke (and fights, of course).
---
Thanks I’ll try it!
---
Still a waste imo, but if that's how you like to play then good on ya.
---
I'm going to be honest - I think all the asshole 12 year olds are mostly on console. I never run into them on PC. Sorry console players.
---
Hey there bud. Me and the dude already put our differences aside. Your white knighting isnt needed here. Go join the neckbeard crusade or something.
---
You BOS up these armors or no dessert for you, mister!
---
 your right tho but ya I enjoy the pvp alot
---
I grew up in rural Tennessee and some of the nonsense I heard pouring from my own family's mouths still keeps me from having any real hope in humanity.
---
I mean what else is there to be attached to for the quests than the rewards. Content so far really hasnt been that greatly engaging so people are gonna flock for the loot.
---
Very nice. I’ve done the Event a little over 10 times looking for that plan. 
---
Did you already complete the quest Wolf In Sheep’s Clothing and earn the level 30 Fixer before you got the plan?
---
Thanks for the upload.
---
Players destroy CAMPs (because of reasons.) Whitesprings has heavy player traffic. If you CAMP there, your undesired outcome is more likely. You may use this information to manage either your locations or expectations as you see fit.

I had to collect all 3 clues before it would advance for me, I got the data from the terminal second.

A real solution would be to remove the character as the driver for the view and turn construction mode into the same view/control as the in-menu camera mode.
---
True, maybe I have the wrong definition of “cast” in my head lol
---
Please I’ll pay money for them.
---
The main problem for me is that if I miss a few shots, due to running a TSE Gatling, if the enemy gets close enough then I'll start killing myself too. Yeah I could switch to another weapon but I don't want to haha
---
Oh sorry, I had found the answer about Unyielding. That's what brought me to a 4 month old thread. Was just asking about the 20% hp/80% rads playstyle you talked about.
---
cool idea, but posting this 2 days after we just got Excavator skins makes you seem ungrateful af
---
I prefer to talk to Moo Moo :D
---
That's sort of the direction I'd expect with players. If someone has enough negative karma players would hunt them for loot or bounties.
---
Freeze and suppress I think is great.
---
This sounds like it’s going to end up in the atomic shop.
---
Blast damage going through structures isnt how grenades or any other explosive works.... it's a bug or poorly designed. Either way it should be looked at. I'm deleting anything because I havent broken the rules and you're just making yourself look like an ass.
---
PC Confirming this issue trying to add X-01 Calibrated Shocks mod. Will not complete/materials not used, but apply sound will trigger.

You. I’ve crashed to home on Xbox six times now.

A desk fan could be a "cooling unit"

I guess that would make more since than using the .38 receiver on my combat rifle since I'm a gunslinger.
---
I remember some Microsoft console sales being reported  in the hundreds per month at times. Yes, it's really that bad. They probably sold more Microsoft phones over there :)
---
His *soothing voice* is my favorite. My camp is at whitesprings as are all of my mules, so I sell there
---
I liked the event. You're surrounded by level 52 mr gutsys and a high level mini boss, it's supposed to be a little difficult. Perks first aid 3 and field surgeon really save the day for me
---
I think this is a balancing decision. To promote exploration for necessary components.
---
&gt; If you're going to come here to tell me to play what I want and that it doesn't matter, I don't really want to hear it, no offense. With that said....  
---
&gt;I haven't played this game since shortly after launch and I know there have been a lot of changes.
---
That's just it, it sounds like your gonna wanna just run around with some buds and kill shit.  You can do 95% of the game with just that, anything really.   You haven't been playing in a while so I assume you don't have 80,000caps or 25 TSE from the day laying around.  If that's the case then your are no where near ready for for any specific build or gear lay out, unless you like ebay.  My suggestion to you is to just keep plugging away with your group and "bank" perk points.  Find the style you LIKE not what the "meta" is.  A few mandatory quality of like would be Marsupial and speed demon along with the Starch Jeans perk card under luck.  That's about it...again...play the game and discover what YOU like, trust me, it REALLY sux spending 65 points on perk cards and moving perk points to only discover you hate the play style you have chosen.   
---
I give this advise based on 800 hours of play and over 450 levels.
---
Cammando+tank killer!!
---
Hm I always tend to blow my load early.
---
I dont think I should make any videos then....
---
Awesome! That's where I found my first power armor frame too. Congrats!
---
yeah i've been thankful to see people confirming the games i play are still in fact playable, don't know why some people are getting uppity about posts just trying to give people peace of mind.
---
But here's the thing, a heavy weapons build shouldn't be surprised that you use a lot of ammo, that's the whole shtick of heavy guns. Throw enough shit at a wall and some of it will stick. Shotgun builds expect things to die fast and in a few shots, so I can only imagine how much ammo got spent fighting the event and its adds.
---
From the hardest event in the game I think there should be a guaranteed 3 star at the end, after even 3 stars are crap 70% of the time. The real challenge is getting a good 3 star to drop.
---
I'm making a commando build next haha
---
Yea it would be easy to manage this on their end.  They could store server side. Or even store just the 3D wire frame position cords and render the images on load ect.
---
I bought that skin and I don't even use Excavator armor. I would buy this one too.
---
*Todd appears from his room* bu...but...but It just works! :(
---
Crafting shotgun ammo is such a pain when you also bulk all of your junk like I do! There isnt enough plastic to go around!
---
How do legendary drops even work? I've killed level 60 legendary 3 star mobs and they drop level 25 1 star legendary items...?
---
I would love pack brahmin. It would add a ton of legitimate play for traders.
---
Just seems to be a redundant point. You're basically just saying "it exists so don't discuss it."
---
"Exploration"? The world is empty bro.
---
I like this a lot. Makes me sad cause this seems very doable if the effort was put it at the start.
---
My bloodied heavy gunner makes everything except the queen and new cryptid monster a walk in the park.. and with bloody u dont use hardly as many bullets either... Google bloody heavy gunner build should get you in the ballpark.  I have my special is s12 p7 e4 c4 i8 a5 L14.  May move a point or two of str into agility later on, but this setup wrecks as is... most of the game is too easy now, but I've also been playing way too much..
---
Whichever one is closest when I'm over loaded
---
I agree it's ridiculous. I stopped curing most diseases ever since I noticed Radaway lowers your resistance 50% and lasts so long.  Most come and go unnoticed. "Oh, forgot I had that."  Shrug.
---
&gt;Diablo 2 DOES NOT HAVE GUARANTEED DROPS.
---
Yes it does, helllfire torches from the 3 uber's guaranteed to have a hellfire torch drop from them. Like wise anni charms are for sure drop from hellfire Diablo.
---
cool, many people would, I even say it's a cool idea, but posting "I WANT THIS" right after we just got something similar makes you sound like Veruca Salt.
---
This is pretty brilliant, I love the simplicity.
---
Ah
---
Today when I played only the shopping mall vendor was different, it resembled one of the whitespring ones
---
The others looked all the same
---
Yes, I had a lvl 30 Fixer and heard rumors or maybe someone datamined and said it's a possible drop, my 3rd time completing the event, so far I received the imposter sheepsquatch mascot mask , Mascot Imposter outfit, White Wolf Fedora, &amp; this Fixer Plan. RNG has been treating me well lately.
---
i also have the digital &amp; everything seems fine since changing my name
---
Check grafton
---
Idk, I got 4 legendaries off of an enemy I one-shotted after the guy I was running with tagged it so I don’t think that’s what causes it. Neither of us died and we both got 4. 
---
Or if it does cause that, it isn’t the only thing that causes it.
---
I did this on my second character too. I don't think it was worth it.
---
we love you japan!!
---
So Bethesda has been Vault-Tec all along!
---
Follow up to the overseer location question:
---
If you know where the overseer is, FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, WHY WON’T THE MOTHER$&amp;@%IN’ QUEST CLOSE??!!!!1!
---
I’d prefer the magazine racks from 4
---
Could we get and option to take Rose out 😂 But I love it so much
---
You buy the part and craft the card. I’ve read super duper can proc on it too.
---
100% need more flags. I want to be able to see who puts up that commie flag so I can bust their camp down.
---
You might be forgetting here that this game include lighting and meteo effects?
---
This is great, thank you.  
---
FYI: I couldn't analyze my sample, the terminal didn't give me the option.  So, I logged out and logged back in and then it worked fine.
---
Only the toughest of the wastelanders will succeed
---
one of my atom poses used to do that too, more often than not it wasn't available but they did eventually seem to fix it so maybe just give it some time? i know it's a shit answer, it did take awhile for it to start consistently showing up, maybe they'll have a fix for it quicker now?

I was tossing around an idea just last night that maybe there could be different types of fertilizer and the crops could be grouped into families each requiring a certain type.
---
They’ve been posted on this sub just search codes it’ll be a few down on new posts
---
Congrats.
---
PS4, I also did the event and got the plans. I'm hoping to sell a few level 50's. Also received the sheepsquatch head at the same event. I already had the costume from before. Made my day.
---
I've seen a few but they were the legendaries that dont have a star next to their name. Usually Protectrons.
---
thank you
---
I did it like this
---
This. I was on a server last night where only me and one other person on the server was over lvl 100. The sheepsquatch event triggered and I did a big 'nope' because there's no way that's happening with all sub-100 players. Same thoughts for the nuke. Before I join Scorched Earth, I'll check to see how many high levels are on the server and if there's not enough on the map, I don't waste my time.
---
Go get the Plague Bearer mutation and revel in your damage aura.

Can someone from the US not buy and send u one....or can u not order from an american site i.e. gamestop.

It’s “easier to find”, and it’ll tell you what thing your looking at. This would actually give you a reason for using the camera
---
Ad Victorium brother!
---
Asking because I'm pretty sure they removed the syringer from the table last patch, and it appears to have worked its way back in.  
---
This is starting to look like a version control issue again.
---
That would be awesome, and I am on PC. IGN: GIcrow
---
I just need the marine armor helmet, I was fortunate enough to find the tactical. Just didn't know I was wasting my time searching for a plan that didn't exist lol sent you a friend request, just let me know when you're on sometime. I'd be more than happy to pay!
---
Maybe 150? I've only done the event 4 times so far, but it's typically pretty short and you can really save a lot of ammo if you're not shooting at an invincible target. I only spent 300 ish rounds of ammo on my heavy weapons toon when I did it. It's really not that big of an ammo dump tbh. More importantly than that, this whole thing was just a joke how the fuck are people not catching that?
---
Scorchbeasts, even the level 80 variants, are easy to take down with lots of different builds. VATS crit stealth builds can take them down easily. Heavy builds can shred them in seconds. However, if you want to talk theoretical max dps for the SBQ, then a bloodied build with a .50 cal is the way to go.  
---
Bloodied ranged builds aren't risky. People think that mistakenly. When you're running 50% DR at all times due to emergency protocols and in power armor, you're still very resilient.
---
Regardless, they were wrong. It wasn’t a mod at all, it was plans for the salvaged assaultron head weapon itself, and the second thing it said I got was actually a bug or whatever.
---
I’m camped at the Whitespring station so either the one there or any of them at Whitespring
---
I've had about two disconnects since I got back on the game a month ago, prior to this patch. I think I've had five or six since the patch Tuesday. It's definitely not just you.
---
i think i can help you with that but you still need to mod it.
---
Tbh I’d rather have the diseases 2x more powerful with a 1/2 rate of contracting. I think that’s fair.
---
uhhhhh, okay.
---
Far as I know most event spawns (number of mobs in the spawn or health/defense of single spawns) are based on the number of players in the event area.
---
Which would be great for knocking out challenges like the rad ant one at tea time since it all but guarantees plenty of ants with 3+ players there.  But it still seems to only counts YOUR kills, even if you tagged the mobs and/or are in a group...so instead it's actually worse.
---
For one, if you get staggered or break a bone while under fire, that counts as moving and disables the sentinel effect. In addition to this, Bethesda have increased damage against players scaling. You should already know about Fireproof and Dense negating Explosive Damage, but this still leaves ballistic weapon damage and with AA and Tank Killer or Stabilizer, they are already ignoring a massive chunk of your DR/ER. You have made good choices in Dodgy and Serendipity, try also grabbing Lone Wanderer and Suppressor as they too reduce damage percentage wise.
---
I think in terms of pure DPS, meat hook or power first or maybe deathclaw gauntlet wins. A bloody .50 Cal with an optimized heavy weapons build does probably 75% of the DPS though, and is about 100x safer.
---
the robot vendors are my friends
---
Ah right that's understandable then :)
---
The copy/paste clipboard got full so they couldn't port them all over during development. Don't worry though, you'll be able to buy them with Atoms in upcoming patches.
---
So *you’re* the one who takes my camp spawn 😂
---
what would you consider fair?
---
Keep doing the new event.
---
Jesus, that's harsh. I thought having to re-re-repair my gear through two disconnects was obnoxious, but rebuilding a Camp? Ouch. My condolences.
---
sending invite
---
I would think whatever financial institution handles the transaction can handle the exchange rates. Only thing I would guess is maybe a regulatory thing. Though Japan can’t be a stranger to in game currency purchases. So I would think it has to be Bethesda dragging it’s feet.
---
It's actually pretty easy to survive except from the Sheepsquatch. The robots don't do much damage and are very easy to take out if need be. Most people now are also realizing you can have certain perk cards and can tame the robots as well.
---
The whole system needs to be reworked, really
---
They would be useful against trolls.
---
They will drop though that's the thing...
---
okay thank you! i haven't had a lot of chances to do it yet as it doesn't seem to come up very often when i'm playing &amp; i wasn't sure if it was worth it to keep looking for it if it wasn't the way to get the plans.
---
Level 50 I think, 45 at the least. May be affected by my mutations also, accidentally got the one that drops energy attacks. And yes that was with no perks or buffs
---
tank killer works with automatic rifles? didnt know that!
---
Does that precede a crash for you? I haven't experienced that
---
it always shows me offline I am on though
---
I was thinking like sandy, rocky, etc. soil and then different lights and moisture to create different conditions. So like a high sand high moisture medium light environment is perfect for say bloodleaf
---
**YES, PLEASE DO THIS.**
---
I have gotten plans from it after multiple tries just keep jumping servers if it does not pop up after awhile.
---
Yeah, gonna have to test it with a critical on that sheepsquatch...
---
This pop up is useless they swapped buttons what meant i will see pop up, quickly press tab to cancel and yea it will be scrapped 😞
---
Oh right, I forgot that one has a little Tuxedo.
---
I would paint them (atom shop paints) and love them and program them to play flight of the valkyrie with targeting parameter of mirelurk queens in SBQ fights.
---
i will definitely be doing that now, ha, thank you again :)
---
Yes. PC.
---
I can't think of a single mmo or multiplayer game that has this feature. There have been people who have wanted this from the start, and I have no idea why they can't realize that this kind of thing is impossible
---
Thanks for your help my friend.
---
Any other ideas would be greatly appreciated.
---
I haven't seen that but I do have a distant blue glowing spot when I look north
---
Maybe you shouldn't be throwing stones...
---
I dont believe the boss scales like sbq, so mooch away. Just dont be in the way.
---
If the internet has taught me anything, whatever you can do there's a market for it.
---
Im up, lvl 109, we can lunch a nuke if you add me, TheMegaK
---
IGN: Thirdstorm, will be on after 21:00 EST.  
---
Happy to help a fellow raider out.
---
Not so much a solve as hiding and swapping cards is something you might want to do if you can make yourself scarce enough.
---
It is, of course, easier to do if there are other players.
---
Also possible if you've stumbled into a faction v faction fight but you haven't been noticed yet.
---
At that point, why even have limits on the cards? Like, there are some cards that the majority of players will almost always grab. What's the point in making it tedious and boring to swap back and forth? They really need to rework this entire perk card thing
---
Me. Last night I died fighting the SBQ and my respawn counter for the event counted down from 3 to 2 to 1, then just stayed at 1 the entire time while the camera revolved around my corpse. I told my mates this happens all the time, and that I'd have to restart my FO76 to get it to work again. When I rejoined I couldn't loot the queen, never got the event rewards, and was bummed.
---
There are all sorts around. You just gotta look. Do you trust me?
---
I have lockpick 3 and can't remember the last time i picked a lock. Not worth the hassle for a random vanilla gun and 5 pre war money
---
They nerfed respawns in nuke zones couple times already. Now it's the race who will run there first and kill everything as you never know if they will ever respawn.
---
I don’t think her story is complete. We might learn more in the Wastelanders update. It’s staying in your Pip-Boy in the meantime. :(
---
Not the ones from the atom shop though...
---
Level 160 here, on PC. There are some jerks, but mostly everybody is cool. I've only had problems with five players so far.
---
What uses pumpkins and cranberries?
---
The only way I can see this working is if they have an item that only shows the picture to you. To everyone else, the item just looks like some generic scratched up empty picture frame that they already have a model and texture for
---
Well I mean I'll always use those stupid supercell games as an example. Yeah you can do almost all of it free. It just takes years depending on the game or almost a year. However you can spend money and get there in a fraction of the time. So yeah you're paying to win at that point. It's their business model in particular. Now games with loot crates and what not. I'm looking at cod bo3. Because I haven't even really played games in 2 years. Most that stuff is cosmetic and usually not game breaking. So you're not really paying for a win in that sense.  
---
Whoopie fucking doo though. If you don't like that shit just find something more productive to put your time into. Most of those games are just a joke now.
---
They have limits but they are vastly more powerful than anything else. Super imba, just because it is "possible" to kill one, doesn't make it balanced.
---
Are you gonna make it from scratch? I can just hold onto the mod until they fix it. I literally just come across raider mods and throw em on my raider PA for fun or tactical reasons (reactive plates), but it's not my main suit of PA.
---
Damn!  I just got to level 50 and want to mod my power armors!
---
Nope, only the improved repair kits, not the atom shop ones
---
‘Info’ is already plural no need for the ‘s’
---
Apologies for the pedantry.
---
Gotcha, well I am thinking this is falling under the infinite load screen, will edit to include respawn as well (seen it myself a couple times)
---
that's robot armor, the helmet could be a diving bell though
---
Not really. Mom said not trust strangers and I'm lvl 215 with 600+ hours of gameplay. The world is devoid of anything to "explore" other than a couple neat marked locations.
---
One day, I hope when doing the messenger quest, someone will answer the door.
---
that's just robot armor, the helmet does appear to be a diving bell however...
---
Vault Girl for life!!
---
I've gotten four of the mounted heads from doing the sidequests in the taxidermists' office. Hoping the only way to get more isn't the event.
---
how much?
---
Yeah more skins for the excavator having only three kinda sucks the base one, the raider one, and the gaharan one don't look very different from each other so variety would be pretty cool
---
Would also be cool to have them be deployable. Maybe like a signal grenade for drone delivery, 6 in a bundle
---
Yeah, going through all the json files and quest files, the only thing I can see affected by amount of players is her adds. It checks for players in proximity before it decided what to throw at people for next encounter wave. So more players = more side XP. I'll take that.
---
Maybe in your eyes. In mine its obvious they are working on more skins for the excavator, this isn't even the first one.
---
I don't think there is a right time to hold off on an idea personally, and I really don't care what people are going to project onto me for the post.
---
It's a suggestion, not a demand.
---
My .45 lever action is called ~Abroham Lincoln tilde for ease of sorting
---
I'm having the same issue with my power armor. Has anyone found a workaround?
---
yeah i did those with a friend &amp; we seemed to get the same four, so i guess they're a set reward for those quests. we were wondering if they were gonna add more next week maybe?
---
Especially with how many people use the armor
---
I want Nuka Cola stuff. My gamertag isn't NukaCola Fusion for no reason!
---
I’m pretty sure the photos are client-side only, so if they could do this, you would see your photos in another player’s camp, and they would see their own photos at your camp.
---
Seems that alot of people here think that "balanced" means no armor or weapon being better than any other but that's just not how RNG based games work nor is it how any game's endgame gear works. Yes, it is better than most armor but it also has such an insignificant drop rate that its justifiable that it be stronger and its endgame gear which is usually.... stronger.
---
Yeah. I noticed it for second or two and then game will lock up and I’ll be greeted to a launch game Xbox screen.
---
Even that isn't always true because add waves can easily bug out. I've seen both very low amounts and none when we have a bunch of people there
---
that framerate is lower than my grades
---
In terms of how the devs should spend their limited and valued time I really don't think this is an even remotely relevant priority
---
Actual vendors at original locations carry different items and mods. Checked this 3 times at 4 different sites.
---
It's a whole 'nother state!
---
Naw, raider gear is a HUGE step up from normal armor
---
Reddit Jealous Threaders...sorry m8
---
No doubt it bugs outs, but it looks intended to do that.
---
Where exactly did you find the info for the add spawns? I'd like to take a look at that part
---
Where are these side quests?
---
Can we upvote this a million times.   This can't be too difficult to do
---
Sounds like you got a set for yourself. Sorry but it's not balanced, expect a massive Nerf in the future.
---
I can show you the world. Shining, shimmering, splendid. Tell me, princess, now when did you last let your heart decide? I can open your eyes. Take you wonder by wonder. Over, sideways and under
---
On a magic carpet ride. A whole new world. A new fantastic point of view. No one to tell us no or where to go or say we're only dreaming. A whole new world. A dazzling place I never knew, but now from way up here it's crystal clear that now I'm in a whole new world with you. Unbelievable sights. Indescribable feeling. Soaring, tumbling, free wheeling through an endless diamond sky. A whole new world (Don't you dare close your eyes). A hundred thousand things to see (Hold your breath, it gets better). I'm like a shooting star I've come so far I can't go back to where I used to be. A whole new world with new horizons to pursue. I'll chase them anywhere. There's time to spare. Let me share this whole new world with you. A whole new world (A whole new world). A new fantastic point of view. No one to tell us no or where to go or say we're only dreaming. A whole new world (Every turn a surprise). With new horizons to pursue (Every moment red-letter). I'll chase them anywhere. There's time to spare. Let me share this whole new world with you. A whole new world. That's where we'll be. A thrilling chase. A wondrous place. For you and me....
---
Holy shit, I love it! I’m on xbox, so I’m not tryna steal your spot, but where is this?!
---
Sorry. I stoked my crematorium too high when the body count piled up.
---
Yeah guys! Stop making purchases that this guy doesn’t want! Totally unfair to him!! /s
---
This is my recommendation

---
I kept most of your QOL perks on. Moved the crafting ones and added others in their place. I replaced reduced ammo weight with one for heavy guns. Replaced that weird DR perk with blocker 3. Added fireproof 3 as a substitute to your endurance perks, you really want that for SBs, SBQ and PVP.
---
You also have 6 more points to spend at your discretion
---
then your choice of words is poor...  I never said we aren't getting more armor skins, you would have to be pretty fucking dumb to think that, but when you use phrases like "give us" and "you need" and "we need" it comes off as demanding, if you want it to sound like a suggestion I would refrain from those phrases, try "I would like" or "wouldn't it be cool"...  cos as it stands your post is very demanding.
---
This is the saddest message I've ever read in this sub.  
---
I'm not crying, there is something in my eye.
---
It's... a dialect? People in London think your English is dreadful, too.
---
Whenever I went here, enemies spawned. Do they not do that when you camp there???
---
Doesn't matter now, any one will do.
---
Just curios my little experience was a few years around 1990.  Though server side low dpi images would be the reasonable way to do this.  Images would not have to be big at all considering they would likely be a small poster size at best.  Plus hackers would likely be perma banned anyway.  Not that they could easily get images to server-side.
---
I didnt write down the quest holding it, but it's the parent of SF_CB15_ScorchedbeastQueen_Lan
---
It's the last part of the Scorched Earth quest chain and has a bunch if controls for her actions and adds.
---
According to the Church of the Children of Atom, Atom is not for sale.
---
Thank youu
---
My camp is nearest to Whitespring but that place is frustratingly laggy. I use either Watoga or Welch.
---
Well now you have
---
I totally agree with you. I go to White Springs and get a drink from the water fountain probably 10 times a day since that's the only way to get rid of them without using disease cures.
---
Lol, did the Winding Path event, forgot about the chems part  
---
Did the Winding Path event again, with chems this time.  
---
That didn't register either.  
---
FML  
---
I'm going to bed, lol
---
Now you're catching on
---
Absolutely! It adds to the survival aspect of the game which is nice when it’s properly balanced.
---
Thank you for bringing this up in a post that got a bit of upvotes lol.
---
&gt;	Yep...just surprised they’ve reached a new depth of cant be arsed.
---
More like this community has reached a new low of pettiness.
---
/s
---
I can do this when playing Subnautica, would be great to do it in FO76. Great idea OP!
---
Yeah and with how cheap it is to make (not sure if cheap just have made alot) I'm able to make a set and just give it away and going around and seeing so much yellow and black colored power armor it kinda hurts because it is used so much
---
ah yes, that’s it. grounded mutation is reducing it. I was gonna say 25 seems crazy lol
---
I just got mine for 2k suck it lmao
---
I’ve only ran the event 3 times so far, and the first 2 went fine with me getting in some hits and picking up a legendary from the imposter, but on the last run I did I got no legendary. Instead the guy gave me a drill. A god damn drill.
---
I found out recently that it hotloads mid-game whenever you go to the perk selection screen. I was so annoyed at quitting to desktop &gt; editing &gt; relaunching that one day I gave up and just edited while the game was running. Next time I launched the perk selection screen, all my changes were reflected. Made it way less of a PITA that I had assumed it was.
---
Nice to see you edited your comment there
---
Yeah all of the above, but I don't see a problem with it myself, maybe everyone else is just unlucky. I mean I have 2 Endurance and don't run Vaccinated and I don't get a disease every time, sure it's fairly likely to happen but I've been hit 5 times by diseased bloated ghouls and didn't get one
---
Yeah if you have grounded that will kill your energy damage.
---
And let use put those pictures on in-game t-shirts :D
---
Just giving Bethesda more reason to waste time and resources on useless content
---
High school or college? In NY, at least, college Japanese 101 made sure you learn hiragana first and phased out romanji very, very quickly.　がんばってね！
---
All my treasured stuff has been re labeled with an * to put it at the top and my initials, to try and keep mistakes to the minimum.
---
People make fun of Bethesda for going back and changing things, and the one time they stay true to the originals, they get called out! They didn't have any paint jobs on their T51 in 1 and 2.
---
Level 105 with an instigating Grognak Axe. It's interesting that your Super Sledge only does 305 damage total. My All Rise does about 440, and my Axe does about 340. I have all two handed melee perks, martial artist, Incisor, bloody mess...and also the other perk in agility that allows you to do more damage the more things you kill, I forget what it is. But with that build I can one hit anything, with few exceptions. With my Axe, and any food I'm eating, I do about 700+ damage in one hit. The only thing I think that's better is doing the bloodied build, but that requires you to obviously be pretty low health. 
---
In my opinion, Meat Hook is probably the best melee weapon in game. It counts as both 1H and unarmed, so you can use perk cards for both of those, although obviously there's only so much room in your strength perks to allow for damage. If you got a bloodied Meat Hook, I would go the bloody build and try that out.
---
Actually, Bethesda and Jack Links are teaming up to develop a new brand of Fallout 76 jerky that you can buy in the Atom Shop.  For reals!
---
But it would be cool. But you didn’t have t-60 in all the other fallout games except for 4.
---
No worries on not revealing your locations.  :)  Speaking of locations - in case anybody is looking for one, do NOT use the desk in the top room at the church in Flatwoods.  It eats serums!
---
Oh bummer I was thinking we got some new weather coming.
---
Yea it’s weird, I think the biome thing makes sense.
---
Where my CAMP is I have cranberries growing nearby in the dirt...don’t they grow in water? I swear I’ve seen them in this game in pools of water. Some way to mimic a biome be it a greenhouse or a ‘pond’ type of greenhouse would be cool, but I doubt the latter will come to..fruition.
---
If some guy can send Todd Howard a box of bobby pins and get the in game item changed...maybe stop complaining all the time and help us flood Bethesda with all the shit, we as the community, need acknowledged...I know repeat posts get old but maybe go outside and look at something other than your sceen and it wont be so repetitive :)
---
This is a great idea! I definitely have way too many throw away perk cards.
---
You can make our camp more visible, just build it as close as possible to a popular fast travel point. For example, I’m a vendor and have my camp directly behind the Whitespring station. I constantly get visitors because my shops design draws them in. Lots of people fast traveling there, especially when Whitespring is nuked. I’ll wait for them to show up or I’ll go to the clubhouse and signal players to follow me to the shop. It’s always busy. 
---
If you build your camp too close to a non-build zone, just be sure to not move your green C.A.M.P. box or you might get that message that your camp can’t be placed cause of a future update.
---
You... Clearly did not pay attention to the quest and then complain about it being misleading. Ok.
---
Somewhere else as well, there is EncounterWave\ActorPrice\CT_EWS_ActorPrice_ScorchedBeastQueen.json referenced by one of her curve tables and it should work in controlling the spawns. I can't find that table anywhere. Maybe you'll have better luck.
---
I can craft the Mod, but if it's not your main suit it's suggest waiting until they fix it!
---
Indeed, so much yellow and black
---
yeah but Beth added to the BOS Arsenal with the painted t60, not edited what was already there, if they did this they'd be editing it
---
﻿
---
If someone wants to spend on it, they can. Not like they’re secretly funding a Bethesda Death Laser to blow up the moon. Just buying what they like
---
A chemist build is also pretty effective. The slight health regen from diluted stimpaks with max first aid seems to completely counter the health drain, and I’ve got hundreds of those things. I was surviving as conduit longer than anyone else, and I’ve barely even got armor on...
---
They won't need them because individually the effects arent that strong and if they nerfed it then then anything less than a full set would be useless. Keep dreaming.
---
In the taxidermist's office upstairs.
---
Lol. I shot the SBQ with and Endangerol fart onetime, but I couldn't blame that one on auto correct.
---
I don’t think paying full price for a game and expecting it to be at the very least to be of similar quality as it’s predecessor is petty tbh.
---
My only vampire has been a spiked board, but boy will go toe to toe with a mobs of cave crickets for 20 minutes. Fun but I need something stronger or faster.
---
I was hoping that too but the more I think about it the less sense that makes. I hope there's another way as I really want the mounted Scorchbeast and Mirelurk Queen claw.
---
Slightly off topic, do you know where shadowed armor plans spawn? Ive not seen one for any armor patch since the plans-at-vendors patch happened.
---
I've seen this recently as well. I built a large tower and the shadows on the ground get this hazy look. I think it has to do with the draw distance.
---
İ think it is permanent
---
yeah :( someone else in the replies said to just keep doing the event so i'm serving hopping trying to find it right now to see if i can get anything. it's a hard event to find though.
---
I need some cult shit, a Mothman billboard ain't cutting it.
---
Why comment here? There's hundreds of posts about bug fixes. It's a forum. Let people talk about what they want. They're rolling bug fixes all the time. Chill.
---
I'm actually the sultan....
---
Glad to be of service. :)
---
Yeah, you can camp pretty much at the Whitespring station. My shop doesn’t go 5 minutes without some random stranger stopping by, great for business!
---
🤔
---
Oooooh, you have marine armor helmets? I’d love to learn that
---
Happy to help!
---
Someone just downvoted this 😂
---
Just go to the sulfur drinking fountain by the Whitesprings golf place. Drinking it cures diseases and is unlimited.
---
Yeah same - 500 hours played, level 340. I always hear stories, and the more I've asked, the more I've realized 90% of the bad stories are from console players. I've had one or two "bad" encounters but I found them more amusing than anything. A guy was punching my house, threw a molotov that hit my house.. and me, and I promptly gunned him down with my .50 cal. Meh, no big deal.
---
Sounds like downstate Illinois where wash is pronounced 'wursh'. Jewellery is pronounced jurrry. Although some I worked for Birmingham City Schools where teachers that supposedly had Doctorates in education couldn't speak English. I remember forcing myself to use proper grammar while talking with people at the schools and the younger teachers (40 and under) were the ones that didn't speak properly. The older teachers would lite up and smile when I would say I am doing well rather than I am good. Even I tend to do a double take when I hear someone speaking with proper grammar.
---
Accepted your friend request. Come on over and join me and I'll craft a couple for you (one to scrap, and one to keep, for 300 caps).
---
Oh thank God, it wasn’t just me and my insatiable alcohol consumption throwing off my compass reading abilities!
---
It took me about 10 server hops to get a legendary enemy, and the enemy that spawned wouldn't follow me. It was a mirelurk king that was just standing in the same spot spamming its echo attack if I walked away. Uuuugh
---
Just a bug, seems to correct itself if you back out and reenter the screen.
---
Seeing this on PS4 as well
---
Finally someone posts a suggestion that I can agree with that isn’t random bitching about the game not being easy enough. The game is supposed to be good for solo or group but you obviously get favored more in a group. Especially charisma perks. Someone could always random invite but I know that some trolls would make thing a bit more annoying.
---
Also can we get the shoe-bits for the Marine Armor legs?
---
I’m tired of my brain making the twinkle-toe sound effects whenever I see the tiny feet prancing about.
---
&gt; but you're a moderator with a job to do here,
---
And that job should totally be your sole focus. If you're a mod who isn't on the subreddit and moderating 24 hours a day you have failed. After all, this is a message board and it's far, far, far more important than anything else could ever possibly be.
---
Get fucked.
---
They do now
---
Let’s not kid ourselves, decrypted is the most badass event that’s been added to the game.
---
I recently picked up a 2 shot plasma gatling and it lays the hate on the flappy bois better than my 2 shot .50cal. I can drop them out of the air with this gun, don't care if they land or not.
---
I'ld be okay with it if it were easier to craft cures. I'm lvl 71, craft constantly, harvest constantly, and I've never have had the right pieces to craft a single region specific recipe for a disease cure. Seems pretty ridiculous how difficult it is to get the necessary ingredients. Finding flux has been easier.
---
What is your current spec?
---
Seems to happen randomly. I have seen what you describe at The Whitesprings clubhouse before and also watched it happen in the Enclave bunker, but I hadn't died.  Every robot in the whole place just slumped to the floor.
---
Would be cool to have weapons and other things on our backs or sides.  As long as they stay that, just cosmetics. A bumper sword on the back would be dank.
---
Had a vampire level 5 laser pistol and it was the best gun I’ve had for like 50-60 levels. I even put points against it to boost my other guns. Like the mutations that reduce the energy damage and crap like that, but it just shredded and shredded and I would never die. Sadly it become useless after level 70 so I just junked it. I was upset.
---
I thought the same thing. Legit stopped consuming booze for a week in game.
---
It’s permanent. That’s why it’s 2k to do another one. Gives higher levels a use for some of those caps lol.
---
Seems like a you problem
---
I have about five, but I’m on PS4. I got them while hanging around Watoga there seems to be a lot of those cargo bots around there
---
It has a suggestion tag. I think you are reading way too much into this.
---
Definitely a good idea.  I’ve got quite a few gathering dust and I don’t think they’ll ever get used.
---
Reroll a new character
---
Laugh's maniacally. 🤣 But no it does indeed work
---
You want to watch me blow my load?... alright then.
---
^*unzips*
---
Ok sent
---
New one
---
100 levels without getting the per card system? Wth dude?

---
All relevant DPS perks for a bloodied heavy gunner build, the most effective ranged build in the game for PvE. Also includes swap cards for crafting and all the necessary mutations. Prioritize the primary build while leveling, and spend points on other stuff when you can't take anything from the primary build. Have any questions, PM me. I'm level 340 now and wreck shit.
---
That would be a great! I remember fallout NV was like that
---
That has very little to do with how the positioning of the new vendors. That’s, literally, just bitching for its own sake.
---
Are you trying to be a smart ass by shitting on an interesting idea with pointless comments like "IT CAN BE ABUSED"? It's not working out. Everybody knows that everything can be abused, calm down.
---
There was a fella on here yesterday I believe starting a coliseum type camp and was looking for other people on different platforms to get it going as well so a community could start growing around it. Just thought you might be interested if you want to look it up!
---
They should just go back to fallout 4s system honestly
---
I like this idea, the game is so damn pretty it's hard not to take pictures
---
I am reading your own words, words have meaning, I suggested ways to make your post come off less demanding, fine by me if you don't take my advice, but I am not reading too much into anything, you literally sound like an ungrateful child in your post.
---
are you suggesting that bethesda is vault-tec?
---
I’m wondering this too. I get diseases all the time and figured it was tied to my 1 endurance.
---
Guess it doesn't work with mirelurk kings, then. Sorry!
---
He said "or;" I was affirming that latter position.
---
Each to their own I suppose
---
&gt; But isn't the only purpose of workshops now for PvP? There are far more quicker and easier ways to get resources than a workshop with no PvP risk. 
---
This is precisely the problem. Dying in this game isn’t very punishing, so opening yourself to pvp isn’t actually that risky, just annoying really. However, even considering that, the reward for holding workshops still isn’t worth the risk, as minor as they are. As you say, it’s too easy to get these resources with less risky methods. 
---
The only workshop I’m even tempted to take is the one that gives Salisbury steak without rads. And I only want it so I can pile up the steaks and use them to basically ignore the food foraging part of the game for a week or two...
---
Why this got downvoted? I mean, that’s basically what this is about. I think they’re somehow managed to see that a lot of people where hoarding their atoms for stuff to come and since datamining is a thing we know what’s coming. But they want you to buy shit now booii! Go get the orange pipboy skin for 4$!
---
You can change it to whatever color you want in your .ini file.
---
Correct, the Soldier, Knight, and Officer suits are all undersuits.
---
No one is downvoting this mod's comment because they're "being real" its because they're being patronizing by saying 'oh let me just go tell my professor I cant present my PhD because of Leddit" .. 
---
Like cmon.. obviously I wasn't saying "Hey dude please drop out of school and just moderate this sub!" I'm asking that this sub **actually be moderated** which I don't think is much to ask for **from a moderator**. He/she wasn't voted in or forced to moderate, they signed up for it. We have moderators for a reason yet they're not moderating. Go to other gaming subreddits, they're moderated just fine. Why can't we get the same?
---
You can change it in your .ini files.
---
Then don't go to an event with junk on your person.  Not that hard to think one step ahead.  Unless of course, you're someone in excavator armor carrying half your weight in junk.
---
well there’s the bomber jacket that’s basically the orange underarmor but with a leather jacket, it’s cosmetic so it goes over your armor
---
It’s always a sad day when our favorite weapons become obsolete. Other than my board the only others weapon I’ve been using often is my quad lever action, because who design love a lever action with 20 rounds in it? It really plugs super mutants up pretty well, and 45 ammo is a lot easier to find and make than a lot of others.
---
You clearly aren’t very intelligent lol I’m not going to debate this🤦‍♂️
---
The 50 terminal trophy and the revive one are broke for me :(
---
Thank you for your service, and good luck on the presentation
---
You should send a ticket to Bethesda rather than write a how-to on Reddit.
---
How long did it take the community to find they had just dropped in a new vault.  We figured out the drinking fountain in white springs cures diseases.... And how long before people were talking about when you started being able to pick up the circuit board in the enclave bunker?  I'd give it 6 hours after being told it was somewhere in the world before somebody found it.
---
The people who thought all fissures needed to be closed at same time would organize a professional search with assigned search grids and everything if needed.
---
You know that just because one game can do something, it doesn't mean all games can easily implement the same feature, right?
---
Not to mention it should be stained with cat feces and have rats crawling around on it. I've seen the show!
---
What's this mean? There's a way to activate the event for caps? Is that what those expensive new junk items were for?
---
As much as I’d like that, I shudder when I imagine going back to the constant crashing from the beginning. I love the hell out of this game but fuck it was terrible in the beginning. If the engine is working hard to hold onto so many camps, then we’d lag right out of every single server. Unless you’re talking about keeping a set 24 (or does the game max out at 21 players? I always forget.) camps + set 24 players in a server at all times, in which case, it sounds like a good road to implementing that
---
Hi!
---
I'm not in front of the console now but from memory..
---
[My Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f48564e&amp;d=s50sb2sa2si0se2sj0s01s60p72p10e42er0e20ep0c81c41ii0i44a03la2lb0lr1l71lt0lu2lp1&amp;w=a70&amp;n=&amp;m=0123456789abcdefghi)
---
I tend to go 1H
---
I have a melee build so I’m just hoping like a faster attack speed, vampire and +1 strength. Would be the best powerfist ever. For some reason I love the power fist over the deathclaw gauntlet because of the armor Pierce.
---
I said I'm dumb. I didn't hide it lol.
---
I think the diseases should have more severe side effects but the chances of catching something should be lowered drastically.
---
Lemme just slow down their servers even more by storing 1000 image files in their database
---
Getting sick of seeing people act like spoiled entitled children asking for useless features that barely improve the game if at all. There, we discussed it.
---
I'd love to be able to do this with the Enclave or BoS underarmor. It looks like they're even coming out with an Atom shop underarmor, so I hope so. It'd be nice to have a version of the look that isn't covered by my ugly, mismatched armor.
---
I can confirm the nuclear winter roadmap picture has five stars
---
No issues, I know mods might make a difference.
---
I have Better Inventory and a mod that changes the paper bags to backpacks, no ultrawide/lockpick mods
---
I didn't understand some of the intricacies.
---
Like how instead of maxing out all the Gladiator cards it would have been better for me to use three one-star ones to fit in other stuff.
---
I never really saw the benefits of serendipity and adrenal reaction. That's something that I never figured out until recently.
---
I've just never really been a Min maxer kind of guy. I've always been super casual. Now I see all these insane builds that people are doing, and I'm just missing levels in a lot of the cards that would make that viable for me.
---
Todays ones are just as bad. Kill a legendary near a fissure site... ok so basically you have to do a queen fight, but what when it’s not near enough to a fissure site? Then the specific event thing and the level up one is now a standard thing I guess. Just frustrating...
---
Hotfix being added
---
Me too. I'm on XB1
---
If you're on PC, I would definitely be interested in participating, or providing my assistance if you need help getting it started.
---
Yeesh, what a weird thing to correct on the internets.
---
Protecting and serving and protecting and serving
---
I've thought about it. I have one that's like level 70. But I just put so much time into this one learning all the different recipes, etc and I don't know if I can do that again.
---
Words to have meaning, but you are reading a tone into that meaning that isn't there. This is very common on the internet, people project personality into text, in this case Veruca Salt.
---
Bethesda probably doesnt know how
---
Use pharma farma perk regularly and you will find enough disease cures.
---
Also you can craft disease cures by finding the right plant ingredients, if you have the disease cure recipes.
---
Same 
---
"Go away stupid human"
---
They all come at max level
---
not really any other way to take "give me"...  it's petulant and demanding, you aren't asking or suggesting when you say "give me"...
---
I did apologise 🤪
---
I agree with this simply to reduce the amount of water purifiers in the world. Right now more purifiers are the water storage.
---
&gt; What is end game loot?
---
3 star drills.
---
The one next to my house lol. So glad I can just 1 stop shop now
---
Wouldn’t this mean op lost all of their caps?
---
Thank you. I wasn’t sure which one he was referring to.
---
If you feel like making a new character there's a double xp long weekend coming up on the 25th.
---
Thanks for the answer. What a damn shame 😔
---
I didn't say give me.
---
Yeah I’m pretty disappointed in the region disease cures. It seemed exciting to have harder to cure things but who cares if you have antibiotics or general disease cures that do the same.
---
I like this suggestion a lot. Makes disease cures mandatory just in case. And since they're kind of a pain in the ass to create yourself, the value would match the effort to make.
---
Ah yes, I would love to hang the picture of me banging a super mutant wrapped in chains on the wall.
---
Thanks, I’ll keep an eye out for it!
---
I’m actually curious.
---
It happens all the time calm down kid
---
100% agree! It’s a good part of the game just not really balanced at the moment
---
Awesome thank you all!
---
Cool. Be angry. That's fine. You're still playing the game and wasting your time complaining about.
---
Flashbacks to Vault 81 molerat disease.
---
Sadly I’m not on PC xbone player but appreciate it greatly!
---
it's a subreddit about a video game. and this is legit NOT the only mod. this mod was (rightfully) annoyed at being called out to bear the brunt, I dunno I'd be salty too. 
---
people are so down vote happy on this subreddit if anyone ever voices displeasure, a complaint, constructive criticism, or any words that don't seem to immediately bow down to Bethesdas "greatness"  ... it's ok to love what they created (I know I do) but sometimes it's also ok to complain you feel like they don't care about player base in the hopes to change it.
---
so yeah, mods should mod. but it isn't fair to call someone out singlehandedly on a (gaming) forum when there is other people that can also moderate. sometimes snark happens. was it really that offensive to downvote ? or possibly have some perspective and compassion for fellow humans.  I dunno, I kinda just laugh and move on  because I get down voted a lot so whatever.
---
Could you possibly link me the post??
---
+karma anyway ;)
---
We got new cameras?
---
Yes,you can buy the part and craft a new card. I haven’t done it yet personally though.
---
Wait, what? I'm running around with three points in tank killer for nothing?
---
You can join me if you want, my in-game name is Z0MG_H4X. I have a tight schedule tho, so you might only see me online during weekends.
---
Should've read the labels
---
Same here can't install anything on PA
---
no, you said give us, I was paraphrasing, either way it's demanding, I am just now starting to think English might not be your native language, if it's not I am sorry and now you know give is a demanding term in English.
---
More like New Vegas 🍻
---
Finding an open world with the thing available is absolute hell
---
Then, even if you do find one ready to go you still need someone with a card and changes are your world's too full for anyone with one to join
---
This would be nice
---
Is it this Tuesday it releases?
---
I get diseases when teammates get hit by enemies. It's like FO4 when in the hidden part of vault 81, if a companion got hit by a diseased mole rat, YOU would get mole rat disease even though you were never hit.
---
They’re upcoming used to be next week, now it’s the 23rd
---
Cool cool, hopefully we’ll see each other soon!
---
I was thinking about that. Double XP, and does that stack with the extra 20% in survival?
---
I don't think it's related to underarmor on my defenses are still lower while not wearing it and in power armor.  I also noticed my radiation resistance is lower than normal.  I still think this is an old bug that came back as I remember experiencing the same issue a few patches ago.
---
April 16th I think
---
I dont remember but I don't think so.
---
Because Bethesda decided to let the event refresh every three hours.
---
“Gladiator style combat arena proposal” is the name of the post and it’s from 19 hrs ago. Not sure how to directly link you to it on my phone!
---
I didn’t learn about that until it was too late... the only time I ever used console commands
---
The loading screen feature is super cool. I hope future games have it.
---
It's obvious that they split development at some point between FO4 and FO76. So they were coded differently at some time during each of their development, thus not everything will work with each other just because it's the same engine as FO4
---
Across all servers or does it vary like faschnacht?
---
I'm not saying people are going to go afk. I'm just saying the more things you take away from the design intent of the general gameplay, the weaker that design becomes. I'm not saying the sky is gonna fucking fall, I'm just saying it shifts things out of the gameplay loop a little. Why does everything have to be so fucking binary all the goddamn time.
---
Wow, thanks for  correcting a non native english speaker instead of helping with the topic
---
Lol just here reminding you that your idea is not only terrible, it shows utter lack of respect for the dev work going into this game. But by all means, continue
---
I've had it happen. I have also had all eyebots or glowing ones.
---
This. I know this is the opposite of what you want to hear, but everything’s the meta. Bloodied’s fun till you find yourself dying to a million things on your road to lvl 50 (and if you’re not careful, a million times after) because you want to constantly keep your health so low. Vats/Crits builds with pistols, rifles, etc. are good, but you’re not maxing out your rifle damage to a fuckin kajliion like some people are doing. (Which in my opinion is so boring, the fuck is the point of a game if you’re god-tier? For example: GTA is so much fun after you turn on all the cheat code, but you’re really only enjoying yourself for about an hour.) 
---
My point is: every build has its ups and downs. You can ask the majority of people what the meta is and they’ll say it’s those weird bloody builds who have huge reserves of caps laying around to pay for sentinels, unyielding, bolstering, etc. armor, + whatever 3* bloodied weapon you wanna run around with. Other people will tell you bloodied’s shit against a vats/crits build, and the people running pistol builds... we just don’t talk about those special kind of people. 
---
Just look at the perk cards and pick what you want to do compadre, set up a build then work towards it.
---
TSE definitely sells for more than 1-5k, that was the low it hit during the duping craze. It has rebounded quite a lot since then
---
Hope it’s a few weeks away busy packing and getting ready to move 1800 km
---
Same boat with the nukes and 800+ hours, however I'm more discouraged by the fact that out of my 5 leveled characters only one has not actually discovered Grafton Dam, the rest have, but the Challenge for Toxic Valley counting Grafton Dam won't budge after being discovered 4 times already under 4 different patches. How hard it is to link the Challenges to the actually discovered locations? I hear that's how dupers entering the dev room got banned: their maps marked the dev room as discovered, so poof, ban. Why can't Challenges "just work"? Grrr!
---
Everyone is having issues. Apparently Bethesda is aware of the problem but we'll see when they fix it.
---
Yeah I've seen them start appearing, sadly will probably be ages before I can get a decent one with my luck
---
Keep being mean and I’m gonna tell my mom so she puts out your flame
---
Your english is perfect. But the all caps of atom was kind of odd to me.
---
Ah ok. Thanks.
---
Are you activating the computer?
---
If so and it reads to come back later, event is in cooldown
---
If you operate the computer and it says you need a recall card, well that's self explanatory
---
And finally if you activate the computer and the event pops on, good luck and pray your server comes to help
---
Im just telling the truth, it being mean is completely subjective
---
I'm right there with ya. It is easily the most fun weapon in the game.
---
April 16 th
---
Agreed, I play solo since all my friends hate a game they've never played and while I'm having fun solo the game is way better with people.
---
Running inventory mods? Got the same problem.
---
Yeah I know this, I’m just saying that the event is a massive pain in the ass, it’s so hard to actually get into. Why make it so complicated?
---
Well they did patch again today lol hope they will fix tmr I'm selling X01 mods so all my customers not very happy right now 😁
---
Turn off all other quests this may help
---
See the feature slip? Pushed camera back, pushed player vending back? That's why we didn't get a roadmap to begin with. I suspect they were concerned about backlash, which I am happy to say seems to be missing for the most part.
---
That said, I cannot wait for the camera. I prefer action shots to posed selfies, and am quite looking forward to being able to \*quickly\* change to a cam, take a pic, and get back to the fight.
---
I will. Thanks for your blessing. I like how you're the only negative comment on this thread, but we're all in the wrong for wanting more things lol. I, for one, am having the best performance I ever have from the game, so... Keep wasting your time complaining. Have fun.
---
Sorry i didn't mention this:
---
-I'm not staggering
---
-I have adamantium skeleton , Lone Wanderer Dense mod and Fireproof.
---
The weapons killing me are usually non explosive handmades
---
thats exactly what happened. they slumped to the floor in unison
---
It varies but you wil need to be lucky you wil still need someone with a key. I already used mine and I'm refusing to buy a new one, so server hopping is my only option...
---
No it's disabled. I just tried again :(
---
You two need to shut up or I'm going to turn this car around!
---
Well I’ll have a few hours a night to run it can’t wait
---
I’ve still got one and I’m trying to get into a game where the event is actually fucking on so I can use it
---
Upvoted solely for the reference.
---
We already have like 30 NPCs tho
---
Armor is for Weaklings.
---
I came on here (as a very casual lvl21) to make sure I know as much as I can before going into events.  There are SO MANY unwritten rules and expectations an average player cannot be aware of unless they first know forums exist, and visit them.  It is very frustrating to play a few hours a week but be on the same platform as hardcore, full-time, dedicated players and be expected to play the same as someone who eats drinks and breathes FO76.
---
Hard the believe they’re non explosive, but the damage scaling would be the likely suspect.
---
[This could be pretty snazzy...](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/labyrinth/images/d/d1/Junk.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20111004202045)
---
Yeah from what I understand it affects your chances.  I feel like melee hits spread disease pretty often as well, so I think you only really see it from animals.
---
"Give me" is far more selfish than "give us"  my dude. Demands can be made in a humorous tone as well, thus my comment about reading too much into it.
---
English is my native language, so you can put that suspicion to rest.
---
I wish i could level up factions. Want to be a raider? Then you can't be a responder and so on. Each could have their own boon too. That would be so cool.
---
I like the click of your keyboard
---
I don't know about survival. 240% would be pretty tasty though.
---
Yeah been having that problem too. No known fix yet.
---
I still think you should be able to fire the flare gun at other players to blur their vision. 
---
Would make it kind of semi useful.
---
And the Fire Whiskey unless I missed that somewhere...
---
Bounties need to be better
---
Quad crossbow would be fun!
---
I'm level 143, and Good with Salt has still never dropped for me. I'd trade someone for that.
---
Living that mutation life 😎
---
I noticed this stealth nerf also.
---
I'm also currently conflicted on whether or not my quad is actually doing anymore damage after 5 charges. I shot a Mirelurks queen in the face with 3/4 health and I appear to have deleted her from the game files, then I shot another one in the face 2x and it didn't register any damage.
---
One thing I have noticed that I didn't notice before, because I never used it, is that I can charge it faster if I am running.
---
sure, i will concede that give us is less selfish, but selfish and demanding are not synonymous, it is very much just as demanding, again, especially with the exclamation point at the end.
---
Lol.
---
Exactly. Even let us just claim one faction. That would be awesome. There could be pvp battles.
---
That'll be 1500 atoms please. Also we have 15 different frames, and you love them all.
---
Or at least give us the ability to hide duplicates
---
Again, it is all in the tone you are reading into it.
---
What about smart move l
---
Let’s find 4 people and split price for card 
---
If someone have much harisma it’s 1700 max
---
Yup, either that or an explosive shotty. That fizzing sound makes it seem so harmless...
---
Oh don't get me wrong before fo76 i was barely on Reddit, the lack of help in game and the lack of any fleshed out wiki into drove me here.
---
I'm just suggesting more 'hardcore' players start letting people know instead of just complaining.
---
This even more than any other has forced me ^I ^Don't ^like ^talking ^in ^general to throw on my mic and tell people what's going on.
---
It's a community event more so than the Scorchbeast Queen or Fasnacht event and requires those in the know informing others and helping everyone succeed.
---
I always do this so no it doesn't help.
---
Most players are my level +/- 10 (160) only sometimes around lvl 80. Yeah ik i hardly find any players who can kill me but sometimes i am just confused. Also this is only happening in survival in adventure i can wipe whole squads of sentinel assassin users lol
---
If we're going to catch diseases at such a high rate, can we at least craft a sulfur drinking fountain at our camps?
---
Can I get a Nukashine syringer? Get people drunk on Nukashine and teleport them to a random location.
---
Adult classes, actually. In level 1, grammar was taught completely in romanji, although we practiced writing hiragana every class. In the last class, kanji was introduced.
---
Level 2 starts on Monday. I’m very much looking fwd to being able to communicate solely in hiragana/kanji! (Tho I likely have a ways to go, haha.)
---
Aren't they reading? I don't need to report it at all. I'm only not allowed to exploit it. Posting this here might give it more attention. When people find out what the trigger of this duping is, Bethesda need to react. I only told what i've done, not knowing what caused that exploit.  
---
When Bethesda don't want that people are posting exploits, they should give a bounty, when finding /helping to find a exploit. Some Atoms and no penalty when using an exploit but not benefiting from it (eg. getting higher amounts of caps, high amound of junk, keeping rare items) and i would gladly help them privatly to find exploits.   
---
I won't send them a ticket. Either I can post this here on reddit or i won't tell about it at all. Not my problem.
---
Miss that event
---
What is the quickest way to level up?
---
Should come back next year.
---
 It can take 10-15 minutes to do some of the new quests. People don't log in, say, do Biv's quest once, and go "That's exactly the amount of content I needed. Too bad there's nothing more to do."
---
Loot is as equally as important to a game like this levelling. In fact, it's more so. Rewards you get help better shape your gameplay and diversity. Otherwise, why would anybody care about finding a legendary handmade rifle? You could just buy the plans, build one, and you'd be like "I'm done now." Borderlands, Anthem, and Destiny are all built on this principle, and to a lesser degree, so is Fallout 76.
---
in some cases yes, but the term "give me" or "give us" can't really be taken any other way, I don't care what your intention was or what tone you use, when you say "give us x!" with an exclamation point, right after we *just* got something similar can really only be taken one way.
---
which system are you on?
---
Time to escape Imperial City boys!
---
Path of enlightment is the event at the lighthouse.
---
Can confirm. I practically live there, and haven't seen even one legendary there since the patch (on the streets, that is; the EMS building still works as usual).
---
They could do something where they can say how the T-51 isn’t suppose to look like that in canon and they could change it.
---
Like an enraged Mothman.  Or a high level Grafton monster.
---
Which ones? If you mean the code locked ones, that may be a future update..?
---
That is a very good point. I just took conduit because no one else was. But I was also in private chat with my friend so didn't even think about talking to the wider group.
---
Wooby might be what killed the brotherhood and what awaits in the depths...
---
Yeah those ones. Exactly what I thought, wasn’t sure if I was missing something 😅
---
The camera sounds like the sheika slate one
---
Yes, let me hang my JoJo poses on my camp.
---
Havent played 76 but I have followed this launch closely. I'm playing NV for the first time currently. I dont have a dog in this fight, but i do have an opinion.
---
Bethesda treated its core fan base like a bunch of chumps. Sold a half finished game for full price. How can so many people say its ok to be lied to as long as eventually they might receive what they paid for? Look at how reviled No Mans Sky was and look how far its come since launch. In the end, its their money and they have the right to spend it however they want. I just wish unethical business practices (lying to your customers) wasnt rewarded.
---
Dont even have to mention the nylon bag deception for this to be true. Once that is taken into consideration how can anyone convince themselves Bethesda gives a shit about any result other than their profit margin? Shouldn't there be more than just that?
---
I really wish they would port over some of the lessons learned with ESO. Subscription based bonuses like unlimited storage would be a huge boon for the game.
---
i just go the closest one to my last login. now i can cram in 2-4 Serums into the vendor, and hoard my junk until i can dedicate time to playing more then 20 mins (days off work)
---
I personally don't like selling anything for more than 6k. Having items go for anything higher feels shitty to me, specially when you see some weapons and armour go for 25k each. The majority of the players that can afford those probably earned their caps through illegitimate means so it's pretty ironic.
---
Preach.  I definetly play less the past few weeks.  Too many children up past their bedtime randomly shooting at me in adventure, coming across hoardes 20+ levels above me in regularly really easy areas...its too unpredictable and random for my taste.  I really did like the Fasnacht event -- and will eventually try this new one.  But the attitude of "fuck the lower level parasites fucking up my game" is just....disgusting.
---
I hear ya. You also have to remember connection differences and also this game can be wonky at times. Inconsistency makes it hard to give you a concrete answer.
---
How much you paying for each?
---
Lol I laugh every time I see it, because I know you will be there to comment.
---
That's pretty cool. How long is a class in cumulative hours?
---
For hiragana, I kept a notebook and just filled up pages and pages with each character. Over and over again, making sure to work on my stroke order and angles. That put me WAY ahead of the class in terms of hiragana and katakana. lol
---
Totally subjective interpretation.
---
You have to trick the system. Remove the wall panel. Put a half or quarter size floor on the outside like a deck. Then install the conduit. It needs support, thats what the small floor is for. Then put the wall back up. But connect the conduit to something before you put wall back. It's tricky but can be done. Lots of post's are saying to run conduit outside where a wall panel goes then put wall back in . That trick works for support post also. Set roof on walls then remove one wall panel and install post's in its place. That's how you build a covered porch.
---
I’m 100% down for this sadly I’m Xbox but am greatly interested in making one as well with traps for added effect to each fight maybe even a switch for the audience as well PM me to discuss on ideas and such if you don’t mind and if anyone is interested we could totally make a discoed for this or it’s own reddit thread
---
Wait i just realized, you asked difficulty and mods, neither of those are in fallout 76
---
What is your strength? I am at 15 with armor but I use power armor alot. I heard PA limits your strength to 11 but I wasnt sure. I'll have to see if I check in and out of PA for weapon damage.
---
Attaching mods still not working either.
---
Just go to the Wendigo Cave
---
Couldn’t install mods on my weapons.
---
All i really remember was that it was a melee knife only playstyle, and did it to sneak clear entire camps of enemies
---
How would one target something outside of V.A.T.S? If I ADS at the enemies (this apparently effects nuke card drones and vertibots as well) they show up with a name and health bar, but its in the cream 'non-hostile' status color. Its only after damage is applied that they turn to the red 'hostile' status color, and then they can be locked onto with the V.A.T.S. system.
---
What do you stream on and name of your profile on the platform I'm on XB1 and I think that would be cool to watch
---
I'm not sure you're using sound logic there, you're just in a large group or like-minded ignorant people. But that's fine, ya'll can circle jerk this trash all you want, your idea is still bad. And a waste of dev time. But I wouldn't expect anyone here to understand or care about that. And this game is still great despite the fact that it's a buggy shitshow at least 1/5 the time
---
NOPE. YOU are WRONG on this. Some of us spend a GREAT deal of time in WS, especially hanging out in Artisan's Corner (because Bethesda didn't bother to give us a player hub, we made Artisan's Corner into one)... and having two noisy bots in there really kills it for me. It's game changing. The other vendor bots are merely annoying but the Free States one is really badly placed.
---
After a nuke, it will reroll before resetting back to ghouls. I've had tons (and I means Tons) of level 1 bots, but I've seen the ones you describe too.
---
I got a question! How do you get into the area in back of White springs? it's in the garage area inside? there is a red force field with the hand code lock deal? anyone know?
---
Yeah i'm very confused. I wondered what legendarys or builds they have . i tried out everything. Even anti-armor is not good enough vs sentinel.
---
Weirdest scenario was a russian guy with a explosive laser rifle shooting me down across the whole map while i did nothing with a weapon which puts out a good 1300 dmg
---
It’s broke for everyone
---
Hell yes
---
Oh really so u can’t equip any mods or just that one
---
Love it. Fucking rad idea
---
There are a million of them north of the water park in Toxic Valley.
---
Not any. It’s affecting everyone. PA armor and weapons. Ur crafted plans work but the single use mods don’t.
---
the kitchen at summersville (back of building)
---
Hydro is the way to go!
---
Thanks bro
---
Appreciate the tip
---
The power armor screen doesn't translate either.
---
This would be especially helpful for things like level locked weapons you get during certain quests, like the all rise. Just hit level 85 and mines stuck in level 35
---
Hm. Given this is one of those Live-Service games where they want to rack in the big cash through microtransactions, not beeing able to buy atoms sounds like an issue they'd give a high priority.
---
Dammit I wish you had video
---
I would be thrilled by private servers.  I can see why Bethesda would be too.  Go for it!
---
I would suggest starting reddits for the private server people, and inviting those who are dissatisfied to join the subreddits and the servers.  That would be outstanding.
---
You can get one by getting a little lucky when turning in technical data to camp Venture. Additionally many people sell them online between 1,000-1,500 caps
---
I always see a few around the gold club at whitesprings.  Not sure if this would be tricky though as they might be spawn at a higher level, probably because of a high level player in the area.
---
You know what would be cool - trail cameras we could mount to take pictures of players and creatures coming through our camp.  That could get pretty hilarious if you could pose and stupid things while checking out someone else’s camp.
---
All good, mostly just worried about the higher leveled scorch there
---
Because they’re are a million threads and comments detailing exactly why it’s a bad idea, and I’m sure you’ve seen them by now.
---
The point- is not that repair kits are game altering- it’s that prior to the games release Bethesda on multiple platforms and through several different individuals advertised the game as having a shop that will contain purely cosmetics. This advertisement -will- be false come the release of kits. 
---
The narrative you wrote doesn’t address this main concern of most players only one piece of it, that’s why people won’t engage. You’re playing to a part of the argument that’s weakest not the whole thing.
---
I'm kinda disappointed you didn't find out that Hornwright was paying miners in scrip.
---
We need more gallery space if they're gonna implement a camera as a feature.
---
no, it's not, tone is not the only way of expressing meaning, in fact more value is put on the words than on the tone, especially when they can be quantified and defined.
---
for e.g. if one says "I'm going to vomit" does it really fucking matter what tone they use?  the only exception to that is sarcasm, but we aren't talking about sarcasm.  now take the sentence "I think a Hoarder skin would be awesome for the Excavator PA", or even "I suggest Hoarder PA skins" either of those are a polite way of expressing desire for a new PA skin two days after we just got a PA skin.  whereas "Bethesda give us a hoarder themed Excavator power armor skin!" sounds ungrateful and demanding.
---
to reiterate, words matter more than tone, anyone can say "I'm going to break that vase you like" in any tone they want, and with the exception of sarcasm it only means one thing.
---
if you ever need an assist on a quest or anything feel free to hit me up GT is mom3nt0fzen 👍🏻
---
If I remember rightly I have a feeling that’s linked to a quest line. Don’t wanna spoil it fo you.
---
All games released after April 2018 was supposed to support it. So Fallout 76 should be fine
---
Thanks for that. I had no problems with that. It was the long vertical conduit with the attachment in the middle. It only turns green when you push the attachment through from the inside wall. 
---
Anyway, I worked things out for the most part. I still couldn't get conduit to run in a straight line. And I agree that some refinement is needed. I also wish the radiators covered more space.
---
TLDR:
---
“Im okay with false advertising bc capitalism”
---
Right! Exactly this.
---
I'm glad it's all been summed up so I don't have to. Out of all the things that have been complained about FO76, this has been the only thing that's actually turned me off to the game. I absolutely hate it.
---
Deck sets have been asked for by myself and so many others since beta launch. Along with some other QoL around cards... like dealing with duplicates, hiding cards we don't want to see. And maybe something to do with all the duplicates like trade them in?
---
I would also like to see the flexibility that if I have a rank 3 card i can equip the rank 2 version instead or rank 1 without having to own a rank one and rank 2 and rank 3 versions. Basically being able to choose between the ranks.
---
Oh ok good to know thanks
---
Shitty build of perks?
---
That's what I thought, I will keep questing then. Thanks!
---
Yep, they are sometimes spawned at high levels as well.  Probably due to high level players frequenting it for legendary gear
---
A lot of if comes with preconceptions, recently there was a post about the SBQ *not* scaling with the amount of players showing up at the event.
---
This is important because if true everyone has been wrong about it all this time and just griping about 'lower level parasites' fucking it up for 'us' all.
---
It's like the "Charleston" Traveling vendor.
---
The first person to get him to spawn reported it was at the Charleston train station.
---
Come to find out that's not true at all it's random and he has a few spots he spawns, but because of everyone's preconceptions they've assumed he only spawns at the train station and even though they say no griefing and no destroying player camps, they are perfectly ok with destroying anyone scam that "might" stop the vendor spawning.
---
Spoilerish stuff but, the overseers logs if you follow them tell us that we need to work *together* 
---
If the hardcore players and no-lifers who put the time into the game aren't more understanding and patient with lower level "casuals" then all the community is going to do is push away potential new players.
---
There are a good amount of helpful people on this sub, even more so on r/fo76FilthyCasual sub, they are much nicer to the newly initiated and overall a less toxic sub.
---
Also, now you can attempt to repair things at the tinker's station. What the hell. How is this so broken.
---
Not just that, it's also just annoying in general. When i'm out exploring i have a combat ready loadout. When i'm back in my CAMP i have one that is much more aimed at crafting, scrapping, gardening  and building. It takes ages to swap between them. Why can't we have a loadout manager to do that quickly?
---
Is that the garage area with a collapsed roof btw?
---
Running any mods / have a Custom.ini file?
---
I second this, my GT is CoverZero215
---
I'm going to vomit is a terrible example because it can absolutely be used in a number of different ways, you can even use it in a teasing fashion or to show disgust.
---
You are placing a subjective tone on the words. obviously I didn't seriously mean "give" given that I immediately talk about players purchasing Atoms, which directly contradicts the view you seem extremely bent on applying here.
---
Dude, chill.
---
I HAVE 2 of this helmets [PC] so i would sell the Second one...
---
Regardless of what side you’re on-
---
A major pre-release policy (and advertisement) was reversed, there should be an explanation prior to the release of repair kits.
---
Something like would definitely make sense and be very helpful
---
Are you using mods? If so, you have to update fallout76custom.ini to include the file names from the new patch.
---
Talking npc's those who have conversational options, those who are aware of what happened in this wild Appalachia and time to time have something to tell to us, even when the content change.
---
JUST MAKE SURE YOU DONT DO IT AT PRIME FISSURE SITE.
---
I learned this the hard way for both the legendary and the level up at a fissure site. Neither counted.
---
That's awesome! Glad you're having fun :)
---
I strongly disagree. You can easily (VERY easily) make 1400 caps a day from vendors, that means you'll hit 25k in just a couple weeks. I have found and immediately sold (for 8-15k) guns and armor to people who were clearly just regular players with regular gear, who saved up their vendor cash to buy something they wanted. Hell, I do it myself from time to time.
---
Duping had a ruinous effect on the 76 economy, but it has bounced back far better than you're giving it credit for.
---
no problem..or more specific the other side of the diner
---
Good to know!
---
Ah I am. Will do.
---
i like it.
---
Thanks, didn't know that one existed.  Very, very new to reddit.
---
I am I'll look for the new ini ty
---
It's all good, I appreciate the tip! I'm gonna keep trying. Bethesda can make the challenges harder all they want... I'mma get those atoms
---
Says I can't view the community :(
---
You're doing it wrong.
---
I discovered Fissure Prime doesn’t count as a fissure site for either of the fissure related dailies. Like..
---
.wtf
---
Look to buy a gamma gun and shoot at your feet.
---
Just had a look at mine on my gaming rig at home, here is what I've got (not sure its *the best way* but everything works for me):
---
&gt;\[Archive\]  
---
&gt;sResourceArchive2List = SeventySix - ATX\_Main.ba2, SeventySix - ATX\_Textures.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 03UpdateMain.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 03UpdateStream.ba2, SeventySix - 00UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 01UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - 03UpdateTextures.ba2, SeventySix - MeshesExtra.ba2, SeventySix - GeneratedMeshes.ba2, UHDmap.ba2  
---
&gt;sResourceArchiveMisc = SeventySix - MiscClient.ba2, BetterInventory.ba2, PerkLoadoutManager.ba2, Glow.ba2
---
So....why are you here if it's just a ignorant circle jerk? Hmmm...
---
Never happening dude
---
My friend changed his name and he lost nothing in game so you are good.
---
Hey everyone has to start somewhere.
---
The filthy casuals sub is good and if your into camp building r/fallout76settlements is a great place to go for ideas and to see some truly amazing builds.
---
It's actually a terrible system that needs to be reworked.  I don't know how the random perk cards work, but I get the same perk cards since level 5 (level 80 right now).  I don't want another 9 martial artist, useless endurance cards and cap collector. 
---
Allow us to re-roll 5 duplicates as the op suggested as well as allow perk cards associated with crafting, lock-picking, hacking, etc to be equipped 24/7.
---
It's annoying swapping them out especially in PVP Survival servers.
---
I was helping a friend build a base in a swamp. I had parasites. I found out the disease timer ended when I was notified that I had caught parasites again.
---
Added both! Thanks!
---
What’s the reward for this week?
---
Cool. Looks like we run the same mods too. I'll try it out when I get home
---
Atom shop
---
Right now I just go find the security bots lol
---
It happens to me on x box. So doubtful mods are the cause.
---
Thats for the pipboy
---
Or even better, actually letting you visibly holster your weapons
---
Thanks for being honest :D
---
bloody anything
---
I always get just one star items on its body. I might not bother doing the event anymore but yet, so much steel from the robots
---
I'm for it. The Enclave under armor is pretty much spot on for the character I'm trying to create, but its buried under my armor currently. Blergh.
---
Get carnivore and start eating raw meat. Problem solved! Most enemies you kill drop meat so you can kill more and craft less!
---
Good for lead, steel and aluminium.  I smash em for ammo👍🏼
---
This finally helped me compete after a week of struggling. Thanks man
---
or just take a course in grammar
---
To make you fully aware of your failure to produce useful ideas
---
Where's it been confirmed that it's instanced?
---
My thoughts exactly!
---
&gt;I have cranberries growing nearby in the dirt...don’t they grow in water?
---
No, cranberries grow in dirt (well, bogs).  The berries float when ripe, so farmers harvest their fields by flooding them.  (They also flood the fields to keep the vines from freezing in the winter).
---
I've got some cheap unyielding if you'd like to try it out before you commit to the expensive stuff:
---
1* heavy BOS combat armor chest
---
1* studded leather left arm 39/51
---
1*welded raider left leg 26/12
---
I'd sell you those 3 for 1750
---
I also have a 3* heavy leather right arm +1 perception and durability, that I'd do for another 1250
---
Or a 3* Trapper's right arm +1 luck, reduces falling damage, that I'd sell for 1200.
---
I had seen him deliver a message to huntersville. Definitely seemed a bit more hardcore. Though he did go to the whitesprings clubhouse to sing happy birthday to the ghouls once.
---
It's not something you just come across. (spoilers, but nothing storyline related):
---
&gt;! You can get it, as well as other Brotherhood outfits, by doing the Forbidden Knowledge quest, which is repeatable, and started by finding Technical Data. One of the people who datamines the game files suggests that depositing two is optimal, though it will only show as one on your inventory. !&lt;
---
If only that 1/5 was true....
---
I just counted 20 and no legendary.
---
Let us place junk items around as decoration!
---
Lmfao why you quote bugs.
---
Wow - I'm not going near that thing now.
---
If its got armor or weapon weight reduction thats pretty valuable for mules.
---
no i knew what was going i had it figured out by before step 4 of the quest. i am saying where is the sheep squatch that is in the data mined files. You clearly didn't read the post.
---
If I’m not in a hurry I usually do it for some easy stimpaks.
---
I got ***10*** in END. For what, you may ask?
---
3* Slow Metabolizer
---
3* Lead Belly
---
2* Cola Nut
---
1* Good Doggy
---
1* Aquaboy/girl
---
What does slap damage have to do with it? Slightly confused. 🤔
---
"legitimate" is a stretch
---
Yes! great idea!
---
You've detailed exactly how to do it. That's not helping, that's hurting. And they can't be expected to read every single post - you didn't even tag anyone from Bethesda. This bad faith on your part. Your just asking to make more dupers this way.
---
I can give you them for 50 caps
---
This has happened to me as well with only one quest marked.
---
Removed. I guess you're not allowed.
---
I got them on PS4 without issue
---
The while thing seems harassed to me, with the common vendor pool of caps I don't see the point of faction vendors at Whitespring. 
---
Central market for special items?  Ok, then why have the vendors in the towns?
---
I feel like it should have been either common cap pool OR all factions in whitesprings , not both.
---
Huh, TIL. I knew the root system was obviously in the dirt, but the only photos I’ve ever seen were of the flooded fields (not realising that’s how they harvested) and assumed they grew in those conditions. Thanks!
---
Agreed, I mean that was the case with fallout 3 and new vegas, I'm not sure why they changed that
---
Game balance
---
Got given shit... Done the event 4 times or so. Get killed heaps... Even had some arse steal bag back from right next to me too!
---
Golf course at whitesprings
---
The wild appalachia trailer did show the burrows, it’s the bit that has 4 people all backs towards the camera(some in some superhero outfits) shooting at some on coming ghouls, it’s then after the video shows Arktos Pharma, which will be released later on.
---
What platform. You on?
---
i was thinking about a weekly thread here for pics
---
They grow up north in the forest too
---
Was surprised to find a non diseased cranberry up there
---
Play the game muwuahahahaha
---
Can Do and Good Doggy keep me well fed.
---
sun kissed
---
the other that cures rads
---
and some for vaccine and all night long
---
END RLZ!
---
Are you sure? I know you can change the pip boy HUD but I've not been able to change the general HUD. I need the classic fallout green!
---
Oh man, thank you so much 🙏!!
---
Amen... I mean there are still people who just love to bash this game, but on the other site there are folks who will defend every inch of it, despite the fact that some things are going down hill again. Not only the atom grind thing is getting harder, server disconnects and blue screens are back more frequently. It’s just sad, really... it was actually playable for some time but I got disconnected three times now in 30 mins, same problem yesterday ...
---
Thanks, running errands, will try this.
---
Rumbly
---
Good to know it's just me being dim ;)
---
My PSN is UzzLott. Thanks :)
---
I get that it's a trust issue. They're on thin ice and they made a ballsy (and pointless) move and a bunch of people are mad. Sure.  
---
But really, if it's not game altering, how is it so bad? It's utterly useless even at mid level, and better repair kits are drop only loot. 
---
Maybe I've just been burned too often by games to give enough of a shit. I'm 38, I have bigger things on my mind than Bethesda offering non game altering non cosmetic items for real money. 
---
If that makes me an Asshole I guess I'll just leave. Thanks for actually responding to my most downvoted Post ever so far, though. :)
---
Maybe next time we interact it will be on some cool shit we can agree on like rad new paint or something. 
---
Take it easy
---
I got a super mutant with a hammer to follow me. Worked real good.
---
Git gud and sell your soul
---
Jk, but a lot of the people who are +100 used to farm whitespring before the patch that decreased given XP from glowing ones (I was like 180 or something).
---
I’d recommend areas such as Watoga(The lvl 50 Protectrons, Cranberry Bog in general, same for the Mire, West Tek, whilst also doing a fair goof number of Nuke runs and SBQ, plus also, Nuked whitesprings XD.
---
I don't know, it sounds so many levels of PRO! /s
---
That would kick so much ass.
---
I honestly thought this was the entire purpose of the new camera. It seems very redundant otherwise.
---
Well, after getting the daily 1400 you can still sell them to players. 
---
I guess it will depend on how many serums one makes each day :)
---
New event faster than whitesprings
---
This has got to be the best request I have ever seen on here. Little picture frames scattered about in the camps.
---
To make people select leather armor when they want energy resistance, otherwise once they pick up better armor they'd never go back.
---
Oh there definitely are some.
---
Yep. I noticed this as well. I had only one quest up with only one objective and it was trying to take me north on the radar when i needed to go east.
---
One of them gives Salisbury steaks!?!?!? :-)
---
Which one?
---
I added you
---
Just nuke WhiteSprings and kill some ghouls i did that 6 Times and from lvl 50 i rank up to lvl 68. 1-2 days of work lel
---
Oh for fuck sake. 
---
I haven't even been looking and just browsing my home feed during the day I've already seen easy guides to all of the shit you're whining about.
---
If you don't want to do the mothman event there are spots on the map with guaranteed firefly spawns of 8-10 at a time, there are locations adjacent to fissure sites where you can drag a legendary over easily and if you do want to find the mothman event then SERVER HOP and its easy as shit to find. For fuck sake I've done it three times already today because I wanted to go back and get a picture of the moth at night and then again to have someone else activate him so I could get a photo with his wings spread.
---
Gather steel and aluminum spawn vertibirds and kill them then repeat
---
It seems to be a way to get people to coax into buying atoms to monetise the game, see something you like? But the dailies are harder.
---
I’ve got a hunch that it’s slowly incrementing in difficulty to get less people to rely on that method and just cave in and buy with cash...
---
I was earn caps by grabbing some caps Stash at morgantown but they gone after today server break so idk
---
Woah lol , agreed tho and yeah hopefully as the game is improved it can move towards this.
---
That.... and mine was level 30, while I am level 130. Y tho.
---
OR
---
Have them flip through our film roll on a TV screen!
---
Theres also alot of people that are happy to help. You can sell alot of serums for less instead of selling one at more. If i sell them at 250 people might buy 2 at a time if you sell them at 400 people might just buy 1. Its profit in quantity.
---
I have this issue as well. I navigate mostly by opening the map to make sure I'm still pointed toward the right spot. Seems like about 80% of my compass icons update on fast travel, but then don't adjust to my movements after that. The remaining 20% work right, but the majority don't.
---
Oh yes! I'd love this
---
1.no.  2.yes. 3. Only if a new no build zone is out where the camp is and it blueprints it
---
Fair point, also my responses got super downvoted so fuck logic I guess?
---
Though they said you can repeat it indefinitely, that doesn't mean right away. 
---
I bet there is some cooldown involved or even an entry fee like on sheepsquatch event.
---
Let's hope I'm wrong.
---
Great idea
---
K thanks. Noted.
---
You are either supremely unlucky, or looking in the wrong place. The enemies that spawn just inside the sundew grove are what usually spawns a legendary one out of 5 times. The other group that moves to attack them almost never does.
---
I imagine they'll do something like they're doing with the legendary vendor. Trade some in for points then trade those points for packs.
---
Am I missing something? What is the incentive to level past 50 besides more perk cards that are a pain to swap out?
---
An exploit at the ammo factory with the vertibot and a bed in survival. 420 Xp a kill
---
Yes we need it
---
Dude has an AMA and then won't even answer the questions.
---
I use to do the same but whitesprings is my new go to
---
Bethesda tallied about it before. Not sure where to find it but I'm sure you can Google it
---
Plague walkers rejoice
---
I thought about this too! Maybe let them cycle on a TV like they do the loading screen
---
No one knows where she is, her last reported location is the Mountain B&amp;B
---
Ad Victoriam
---
So it’s still a you problem
---
I don't really enjoy eat/drink mechanics either but I got around it by doing the following:
---
Rank up Cannibal card
---
Rank up Lead Belly Card
---
Rank up whatever the card is that makes you not got disease from drinks
---
After you finish a fight, put on cannibal and lead belly cards and eat your victims - health and food regen
---
When you find water put on lead belly and the disease resist card and drink your fill.
---
Requires three cards, but only 4-6 endurance to pull off. Also negates the need for Thru-Hiker card to reduce food/drink weight because you wont carry any (except maybe 5 purified water for emergencies)
---
I checked my CAMP emote, and it seems to be working. Did you go to the atomic shop and check that it's equipped?
---
Whitespring station roof.
---
This is a pretty good idea. Showing timers and such on the map may be too complex, but if we get an alert when one starts we’d know there’s enough time to complete it.
---
Agreed.
---
Jump and interact, grenade and power attack, not to mention all the other ui conflicts like an inventory ui popping up while trying to reload/switch weapons/use stim when using a controller.
---
That's because it doesn't pop naturally, a player has to spend an item wich costs a bit under 2k caps to start the event.
---
You can keep jumping servers forever but if noone uses the reclaim card, the event won't start :/
---
Check vendors, I think most of them have the card on "Others" tab.
---
I actually told my friend the same thing
---
Best idea I have seen in this sub.
---
Don't super mutants wear sinks as armor... oh no, that's a BATHROOM sink. We want a kitchen sink. Ok then.
---
If you keep your drink and food intake up you'll be fine.  Letting either or both drop will increase your disease chances.
---
Be a good power armor skin for Traders once the player Vending becomes a thing.
---
oooh okay yeah i saw that on some of them &amp; wondered what it was! thank you!
---
press your vats button to zoom
---
X bone here, can confirm no install available.
---
Slow metabolizer, good doggy and lead belly can just be used as soon as you need to eat (You switch them on and then off when you are done), keeping those on all times is a waste of perk points.
---
Yup yup. Birds.
---
Grats! I've been super lucky in this case and got it on my first completion.
---
Not much use for me cause I'm non bloodied-melee main but still happy with it.
---
You can out do it with an online code. The codes are one time and generated randomly. It is very often glitchy however
---
Because people always claim to have bugs after patches and most of the time they are caused by custom ini's and mods they have installed that are not supported by bethesda. Making them non-bugs. Maybe? :D
---
Communities. Communism. Better dead than red.
---
Once you hit level 50 whitesprings is a good grind.  If you do all the main missions you should hit level 50 even if you only play solo but it helps if you have a squad and the increased exp charisma perk
---
You're welcome.
---
Fantastic idea!
---
Wow that’s actually really smart,  I think I have an assassins Gamma Gun.
---
I’d rather they were harder to get, more dangerous and harder to cure
---
Keep up voting, everyone!
---
Buy the circuit board they sell bring it to a tinkerers workbench to craft the card also needs flux
---
I think it would be better if we could opt in to events to be notified and have it pop up anytime an event becomes active.
---
They carry different stuff to buy. But I bet if we collectively complain about that enough, Bethesda will make every vendor carry the exact same loot
---
It's kind of annoying to get pictures off my PS4 onto social media, if there were a way to facilitate that in game and it were quick that would rule
---
Just do an unyielding bloodied two shot exploding melee build, yo
---
You just roll with it. I have been a casual since launch. I may not have the top-tier and optimal set up, but I feel like my money was well spent. When you nit-pick over minor inconviences that are workable with a few extra steps, you take away from all the good that is in this game. If you have a complaint, email the devs your corrected code or data needed to fix the problem. If you can't do that, email them an example of your perfectly built UI. If you can't do that, just explore the game or submit a ticket. The squeaky wheel gets the grease but the noise from these broken operators is louder than the title music on startup.
---
Today's aren't so bad but some of them have been ridiculous. Kill a glowing enemy during a radstorm? Chances of that happening eh. The weekly ones aren't much better. Do an event that doesn't work/spawn, repeatedly do a pvp event that no 4 people are interested in..
---
I agree with your statement "what's the point of faction vendors". However, now you can go to a single location and view faction specific plans and gear. I discovered I didn't know half of the plans available from the brotherhood vendor.
---
To accidentally scrap like I did
---
Lore wise it's already in the game too.  There are a number of examples of other crops being grown at the various farms or indoors.  Make those camp plans you can buy, get randomly, or from related events/quests.
---
Yeah I feel the same way lol I may just hold out and try to re-roll my 3*** instigating when the purveyor is out
---
The flux is fluorescent, which is really easy to make in a nuked whitesprings.
---
Im on console, whats an ini? Is it the opposite of an outy

Screenshots are stored on your PC before they're uploaded to steam.
---
Unless you get stuck with swinging dick Harry who is lvl300 and wants to rape you because they are a "Raider" :)
---
I feel like this is supposed to be sarcastic but of they have different inventory they should have separate cap pools as well. It isnt working as described in patch notes.
---
they said 2+ meaning 2 or more
---
I still sell them for 200-300, what they do with them afterwords I don't care. The vendors are for emptying my extra junk imo.
---
Mods are bugged. Hold on to it until they fix it.
---
Downvoted for this answer? Ok......
---
Yes... and they also said that single player could complete it alone. What's your point?
---
All night long gives you a 60% decrease in Food/Hunger drain at night. So that's an overall +30% more effectiveness.
---
Yes,yes....profit in quantity.They will be making 200 caps for each one you sell em at 250.
---
"Supply and demand", your in the wrong century pal, that was last millennium - now, it's lie to your own people, sacrifice the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent women and children, and give classified no-bid contracts for ***billions*** to a company that you used to run, that you *still own shares of* all for the sake of war profiteering.  Or, sell drugs that are extremely addictive at a high profit margin and reward your dealers (doctors) if they move lots of your product.  Or, sell a combination of a patented herbacide resistant seed along with an herbacide that kills most of the neighbors crops.  Or, pay your workers so little and instead, really on"handouts" from the government to give them food stamps and Medicaid.
---
***So, when you say: "you can't just demand free stuff" to me, you have it absolutely fucking BACKWARDS!!!***
---
It's not ***me*** asking for handouts, I'm actually the one asking to have my taxes raised, because I'm not one of the poor people, that *shouldn't even exist* in a country this wealthy.
---
No sir, it is the wealthy, and the corporations that are the greedy fucks feeding at the trough of government handouts fueled by corruption and pandering politicians that heel obediently to their wealthy masters!!!

Tweaking your build, or completely altering your build. If the RNG ever grants you some god tier weapon you want to start using it's nice to have the perks in the bank to be able to spec for it.
---
In my experience it's just being near a diseased enemy that causes a chance.  And while endurance seems to have some impact either disease chance is ridiculously high or it's pretty negligible.
---
End also seems to have a pretty negligible impact on addiction.
---
If you've dropped a nuke you've completed the main story.
---
I am LMAO.  Did you really have to think about that?
---
Have you done I am become death?
---
How?
---
Exucse me?
---
i mean they don't weigh anything. so if you hoard every bit of lore you can get your hands on like me, yeah there's a reason. i typically just dump all the unimportant ones in my stash box though.
---
Doing the Blackwater mine is a good idea. Plenty of mole miners generally, plenty of their gauntlets get dropped, opportunity to either scrap for parts or sell for profit. Close to whitesprings to do major junk runs, ghoul killing at the golf course, random encounters on the outskirts of Whitesprings as well. Once you've cleared them out, server jump and repeat. You can easily spend hours doing this circuit. The Uranium Fever event is always a bonus to encounter too.
---
Also unsure. I’ve been trying to stash a lot of weapons that I like, but have weird rolls (maybe can turn that nocturnal handmade into an Anti Armor?) and especially weight-reduced items. Not entirely sure how the legendary vendor will work, but seems like it’s helpful to have a stash of weapons you wouldn’t mind upgrading.
---
Was doing it to me last night on PS4. Thought, well there goes my PS4 GPU!
---
I think it brings life to the map. Certain plant life only occurring under certain conditions would give players a reason to have the greenhouse that you mention too.
---
 I searched high and low for fire cap and a greenhouse would be
---
No slap damage
---
If you got to the pc, and it said down or wait kr whatever then the 3 hour timer for the summon hasn't passed. Wait 3 hours or server hop. Terrible communication here on bgs
---
It was a little. I think I might be the only person that actually enjoyed the daily fast traveling all across the map. Now there’s no point in it really. I don’t mind the shared cap pool much I guess, but it doesn’t make sense lore wise at all
---
Hey leave Louisiana out of this, we just want to eat our great food!
---
Just because it was in FO4 doesn't mean it should be in FO76
---
Have you successfully completed the final quest? Have you acquired perfectly preserved pie from a vending machine?
---
10 steel 8 aluminum per spawn, go to the ammo factory go to the vertibird pad it asks if you want to spawn vertibird do so, it spawns you kill get xp then repeat
---
This way is much better. Don’t have to fast travel around each day (if you don’t want to) and it makes it possible to sell more expensive stuff if needed
---
Many end game builds can't be finished at level 50 as many of the perk cards unlock late. Usually level 75 is when most people can have a full build with decent efficiency.  People who heavily optimize can get it done earlier.
---
Has that been released yet? Haven't seen it
---
Ehen you haf to fast travel all over the map you spent half your caps on travel alone
---
Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself...
---
this was made by Young Kim? correct me if I'm worng but your username is not "Young kim"
---
Sounds like they behave like a recon scope.
---
Hmmmm, I think this man may be a Synth!
---
Then I taught you a useful lesson... I see this so often on forums and I gladly suffer the arrows of criticism to help my fellow chat buddies 👍
---
What was the subject again? 😕
---
Swap weapons once you get them below 5%
---
The people who brag about their kd without it even being part of the conversation while also admitting to spawn camping for easy simple kills and complain about any rewards being reduced (caps aren't hard to earn) tend to be try hards who all use similar load outs (or the meta) so its safe to assume that you fall into that category...
---
oh okay cool cool thanks for the heads up!
---
Ya know, I actually totally agree with almost everything you said. Except raising taxes. The rich raise taxes on the middle class and write their own loopholes. Same thing the AHCA did cause it was written by insurance companies to reduce care and increase cost. Cause people making 100k are middle class. The rich are the billionaires that write the checks. Raising taxes won’t do anything, because the people writing the tax laws are beholden to their money makers. People want Trumps tax returns. I want Pelosi’s. How’d most of Congress go from middle class to millionaires, huh?
---
Only problem I have is that you are comparing the aggression you have toward a VIDEO GAME to GMOs, the NWO deep state cronyism corruption model that runs out of Bohemian grove. That’s a bridge too far
---
Buying non-cosmetic items for a video game ***is cheating*** - no matter how much you try to make excuses or rationalize, so please, don't do that.
---
You misunderstand. I am not claiming you, personally, would troll them. I am claiming that any attempt to do this sort of live stream *now* would result is this sort of obnoxious stream raiding.
---
Up the road (North) of Flatwoods along the river.
---
If I am in power armor, a radroqch bite shouldn't give me worms.
---
Your post said 2 level 50+ dwellers implying that there couldn't be more. It just should've been worded better lol
---
In restrospect, maybe I should have used my irl name for my username on reddit...
---
Enclave quest line gets you access.
---
Yes. I bought a "Mutant Slayer's M79 Grenade Launcher" from Whitesprings because it was so cheap, later found out that the actual effects at the workbench are " +30% damage to Super Mutants, 90% reduced weight, 15% faster reload". I was really jazzed about spending that 66 caps honestly.
---
Yeah. I figure I'm gonna be rolling pretty sluggish the next month til we find out what the reroll system is going to be like and I know whether I'm dumping this all or have something useful to do with it.
---
Enclave quest line.
---
Only lasts until dispensed for usage...am I right in assuming your saying it doesn't put the name on the chassis once you've set it down for entry? 
---
I mean, you can rename them, so at least they're organized in the Pip-Boy screen and Stash (pretty sure stash, haven't tried that yet).
---
Sorry my wood is unyielding.
---
Thsts exactly what the insdide the vault says. I think myself and Bethesda assumed that people would get that in a 4 player team game "2+ PvP 50" meant that was the minimum recommend. Its worder fine.
---
Never said they didn't have sights, nor that hip firing guns are real, just pointing out how ludicrous it would be to have a hip firing gun with a sight. And again, with the accuracy being what it is, the sight is pointless anyhow.
---
If all the pylons are active, it shouldn't be cloaked. Unless I missed something the few times I did it.
---
Dunno man, people down vote the most weirdly innocuous things

Ad Victorium!
---
I am thinking scavenger hunt, like for the nuka paint for the x1
---
Nice to see everyone being so positive today! Thought I was on r/fo76FilthyCasuals for a minute here.
---
Thought this was fixed in the latest patch
---
I'm pretty sure I found a syringer before this patch but after the patch before that. I remember a post right after that "fix" where somebody got a drill drop. I thought it was only flare guns that were removed
---
Yeah exactly
---
Thanks for the fast answer. Regarding 1 - does the base still have a 10k limit?
---
End game... nuke
---
‘War never changes...’ blah blah blah
---
Scavenge junk, kill critters, kill players...
---
On and on, but new content  DLCs ? FUN!!
---
😀
---
I never bragged and at no point did I say I spawn killed? Maybe you shouldn’t reply two days later cause you seem to have forgotten the conversation lol
---
Lol! I did think about it...and kind of pictured it unintentionally!
---
Yeah, I had that happen once. Using the thing does take a degree of situational awareness that can be vexing (I once nuked myself by aiming over a ledge at a target and not realizing the actual attack comes from the right side of the screen instead of the center).
---
Cool! thanks, I will check it out tonight..
---
You still get rewards and they have to strike a balance between rewards earned and items lost
---
And again this is a beta version where adjustments will be made to to make sure its worth playing for everyone
---
And they way you described that you play sounds more like a normal pvp game and not a survival game
---
You just sit in high traffic areas and rake up kills that's not a survival game if you just played normal and then killed people you came across it would be different
---
But do what you do
---
No problem, I only realized it when I saw it on reddit :)
---
It’s not item based. Each item has it’s own budget. Lights and turrets take up a lot while walls and floors take up barely any
---
You’re telling me you’ve never seen someone sporting a flag other than the American one outside their home? I pass a few Belgian ones and a German one on my drive to work everyday
---
Yes. I have.
---
Yeah but those rednecks in west monroe are wacked. I know about the food, speent every summer growing up split between Raceland, Houma, and Homer up north. My uncle Ray was a true coonass and if you called hin a cajun, he'd get pissed and lectured everyone on the difference between the Acadians aka coonasses and the cajuns. My step grandfather was a cajun and just would laugh at him every time. My step grandfather ran the LSU dairy farm for many years outside of Homer.
---
play adventure mode and you are fine
---
A bloodied rifle build can be useful in teams to either pick off tons of small enemies or focus fire on large enemies. 
---
But if you don't have defensive legendaries you'll be left vulnerable.  
---
If you have bloodied teammates a support heavy gunner build can be nice. But be aware it'll be bad for solo play. 
---
Unarmed or one handed melee builds are most very strong. Melee is still op. Its had minor nerfs but it still outputs tons of dps.
---
🙄🙄🙄
---
Diving.
---
Is it possible you’re dropping your frame instead of placing it? That was the first things I renamed and mine all keep the name when placed. But if you drop it you lose the name.
---
^ this ^ more expensive stuff 👍
---
Don't worry, it's still something broken, but it's broken stuff that you don't have to fix!
---
Been banking the ones I won't use, got at least twenty in armor alone.
---
In a single 2 hour play session I very rarely see the lighthouse event pop up even once, and half the time when it does the light isn't interactable if I actually wanted to complete it...
---
Leading a legendary to a fissure is even more of a pain due to legendaries that only run away from me, when I get lucky enough to find one anywhere besides a few  highly trafficked areas that aren't particularly near a fissure.
---
Because it wouldn't be a discussion, it would be a literal flood of angry rants and crappy memes that would drown out any meaningful questions. And no matter how they tried to react to it (ban the worst offenders, try to answer only a few and be told they're ignoring the rest, or just ignore the chat entirely), those same people will be outraged.
---
Discussing the game and its problems is important, but putting themselves in that situation would be stupid, wasteful, and accomplish nothing of value.
---
if you were in survival mode that's the whole point.
---
if you were in adventure mode then that sucks but one asshole shouldn't be the reason you uninstall the game, at that point you're just overreacting. 99 times out of 100 the people in adventure mode are chill.
---
And likely the PA when you suddenly disconnect.
---
Sounds like you got MEGA yeeted. Switch to adventure  mode to not get yeeted.
---
They're recon binoculars. "Shooting" with them scoped on a target marks that target for your team.
---
The different vendors exist to sell different things, they allowed a shared caps pool to make buying and selling easier but they're not going to give each vendor an independent 1400 cap stash.
---
It's all the same cesspool of greed and corruption - just selling $4.99 cheats in video game isn't on the same level as say, a church that raped thousands of children, or genocide, or the  Mexican cartel selling tons of Crystal meth...
---
It all makes the world a less good place.
---
I and my friends all participate in corruption in little ways - we tell ourselves: this is nothing compared to the Monsantos, Verizons, and Halliburtons of the world, so why not?...
---
I say, if we have to, use the fucking *military* to close these God damn tax holes - I'm so fed up with the ultra-rich fucking over everyone else.
---
If we don't do that, then at least axe the health insurance industry - that shouldn't even be *for profit* in the first place.  It's so long overdue for the US to join the rest of the civilized world and adopt Universal Healthcare (single payer govt. health insurance).
---
I approve of this
---
I don’t play the game for the loot.  I suppose that’s why I’m not complaining about random loot drops.
---
Bye! 🖐
---
You seem to have a conceptual and dictionary issue...you don’t understand what “cheating” means. 
---
Cheating is not doing something different than you. Or having a different opinion. Or play style. Or anything else. Cheating is breaking the laws within the game. 
---
Is it cheating to use serums? It gives me an edge over you. But it’s a function within the game that is intended
---
Was crashing servers in order to force rollbacks that was able to duplicate items? Yes. Doesn’t matter that people bought them or not, that was an exploit not intended in game
---
So if items are introduced that allow you increased function, that can be gained with in game currency, and are a part of intended non exploitative content...serums vs duping...no, it’s not cheating.
---
You need to learn what words mean. And you need to learn that just because you don’t agree with a definition doesn’t make it change. Your opinion doesn’t matter. I can say you’re cheating and it doesn’t make it true, unless you break the rules. So please learn what words mean
---
umm...  first I only have endurance of 1, second, and really this one should be first, I am not eating people.
---
great. thank you
---
Lore is an awesome part of the game and should be kept to as much as possible. However, things have to come down to functionality. Having all of the vendors share a cap pool may not be perfect in the lore but it makes the most sense for players in the game. Now im actually going to sell things to vendors when before it felt like a waste of my time. 
---
It seems you are interested in factions are you excited for possible faction based PvP in the future?
---
Not that helpful but my personal solution to this issue is to have the Plague Walker mutation, I am really getting a kick out of that one at the moment.  Combined with Unstable Isotope and Electrically charged, most low level mobs just commit suicide on me.
---
More helpful: Use the Sulphur fountain at Whitespring to cure diseases. Since finding that out (and before I got plague walker) I almost never bothered to cure diseases unless they *significantly* impacted my gameplay and if it was one I needed to get rid of i'd normally swing by Whitespring to get rid of it.
---
Of course this doesn't address the underlying issue of high infection rates, but it might make dealing with it easier in the meantime :)
---
Well yes, but the items placed by another player still count to your base limit?
---
I thought I read somewhere that you use your own budget to place items into the base of a group member. So let´s say the owner of the base uses all his budget, can other players still place items in his base? So a group base could hold 4 times as much as a solo base?
---
I think that’s used to be a thing but they fixed that in recent patches because I cannot place things in my friends max budget camp
---
No, you need to learn that just because the devs are selling the cheats, that doesn't somehow magically make them not cheats.
---
If you *pay instead of play*, to gain an advantage, you are cheating regardless of whom you are sending the money to.
---
If you're just trying to rush levels, what you're doing will work fine but honestly I don't see the point. Just playing through all the main quests and regularly doing the claim workshops and side quests that pop up and you'll likely hit 50 pretty quick
---
Ripperoni
---
They should have just increased each pool
---
Well where else would wild mongrels Reddit from?
---
Heh yeah, it can get pretty addictive.  And you've started playing at a time when the game is in a good state, too!
---
If I was going to play for the world or gameplay I would go elsewhere
---
Or an Ultra Instinct Legendary Glowing Insult Bot
---
I think you miss the point of why they did this. They aren't raising the max amount of caps you can get in game per day. They're trying to maintain a consistent cap standard and game economy.
---
Ah, thanks, good to know.
---
Thought about creating a bigger fortress with my friends. To bad.
---
Ridiculous somehow feels like an understatement. Lol.
---
I mean, it is supposed to be a high level creature. When I mean high level, I relay mean un the 110's
---
I was playing with these guys and that is all they do.  Just steal camps and kill just to be assholes.  I can't take them anymore.  I can't stand them being 170+ and 230+ and just killing lvl 25s for their workshops. Then following them to camps and destroying the fuck out of their bases.  
---
It's mean spirited. They couldn't cut it in survival so they punish the rest of us.
---
We don’t have to use our IRL names but if you got his actual name from somewhere else than I totally agree
---
This would be really nice as I like to customise everything 
---
Like I the type of guy that changes the colour of the hud on my computer.
---
Agree. Why can’t there dust pile fall to the ground
---
I’m level 40 and 30 years old. Can’t provide you much but if you want someone to play with I’m down. Add ziggyreznor
---
Thanks!  I'll play around with it tonight and see what I can pull off.  Still need to find or buy a stools recipe though...  although apparently there are some coming to the Atom Shop along with some other bar themed materials.
---
Nuuuuuupe, happens in all my PA frames :(
---
In case you were unaware, the Sulphur Fountain at Whitespring cures diseases. Not always helpful, but might save you a few cures here and there.
---
The fountain is in the park by the tennis courts, small white structure with domed roof and statue on top.
---
I like the idea, but it might not work out too well in the current serverless world.
---
Well Fed/Hydrated with Rejuvenated - 70% Resist
---
Vegetable Medley Soup - 20% Resist for 1 hour (Takes Carrots, Tatos and Salt; Learn from finding a bowl in Fort Defiance)
---
Antibiotics - 50% Resist - 50% Resist for 1.5 hours (Buy recipe from the Enclave Medical Wing)
---
With these and a modicum of Endurance, you are unlikely to get diseases, even if you're popping RadAway.
---
Apparently you’re not satisfied with the loot, either.  So why do you play the game?
---
"Pay To Win" is a tired euphemism - I just have the sense (a deeper understanding) enough to call it what it is: Pay To Cheat.
---
It's not legitimate to call it "win" if you just bought some "Chests" or "Gems" or "Repair Kits" using $$$ instead of earning it legitimately through game play.
---
People have a problem understanding this are typically painfully ignorant, or, incapable of deep thinking, perhaps?  I'm not the one with the deficiency, at least not in regards to understanding of this topic.
---
You can mod the client currently. They have plans for allowing private servers -w- private mods sometime in the future.
---
The PlayStation blog mentions any game published after a set date should be fine. Though I appreciate you letting people know regardless.
---
I haven't edited any of my comments in this thread
---
The tiny bit of hope that i might get good loot for once,
---
I love this mutation (I have 11 mutations now) combined with unstable isotope and electrically charged it makes for killing lots of low level mobs without actually doing anything.
---
My theory based on the description of it is that it will scrap the legendaries or trade the legendaries for another legendary that is requested with certain legendary effects. I don’t think it is reforging but I could be totally wrong
---
In your 20s to 30s, start doing the workshop rounds. Log in, clear and claim as many as you can. After you claim them all or as many as you're going to go back first to last grabbing everything from the resource collectors. Server hop, rinse, repeat. 
---
Great XP, resource farming, plans, etc
---
Thanks for the info :)
---
It says: Level up! (0/3), or in my case (2/3) this morning. So no special criteria was needed, I leveled up and it just didn't update it
---
Not replying to this. You can delete your post and edit this to your other, but I won’t be doing multiple posts with you
---
Great idea yes!!
---
Like the scoarched beast queen, it is too powerful for nothing
---
You literally do not understand the definition of cheating. It’s not your opinion. We can’t even have a discussion when you make up definitions in a fantasy you’re having. Your argument is functionally flawed, and you are your own logical fallacy. You can’t make up a new definition and then base rules regulations and morality off it, trying to turn it into something that was not intended because it gives you control and an advantage. 
---
That literally would be cheating haha. You are doing what you profess to hate
---
Grow up
---
We need more than just that for the CAMP. But it’s okay. They’ll drip feed it to us and in 2 years we’ll have as many items as we did in FO4.
---
I noticed this as well.
---
I've completed the boss battle 3 times and haven't even completed the quest yet. 
---
So I'm not complaining.
---
Power armor should be even stronger tbh. If it were up to me nobody in power armor should die to melee attacks until the armot piece is broken. If your fully suited in a suit of steel. I dont understand how that sledge hammet managed to kill you through millitary grade tank steel. Right?
---
I'm a cannibal with carnivore and butcher's bounty. I'm always full with 5 or 6 food buffs active haha.
---
Excessive, maybe.. But a man has to eat.
---
I'd love to play it! PS4 ryanburns003
---
You can get the plan to build it up to level 50 from the event
---
Gonna be honest. Don't waste the time right now. Prestige system is supposedly coming soon and it currently is looking like everything above 50 doesn't really "count" so it's not going to lap itself every 50 lvls or whatever. So you're better off just enjoying the game, go back and do side quests for special items now that you're 50 and can get them at Max lvl. 
---
Then post prestige, it's gonna be a completely different game most likely.
---
Yes a want this too big let down on the little bit you can grow
---
Thats why i said it isnt worth doing on your own dime.
---
They aren't people anymore, man. They're the enemy. It's a little iffy, but you can also eat mute hounds, so theres that.
---
You can at least take one half of this suggestion and not have to carry (much) water anymore.
---
For food you can get the carnivore mutation.
---
Me? I'll gorge myself on the flesh of my enemies to take their strength as my own.
---
This sounds like a blast to just spectate
---
Yeah there’s that. But numbers can always be adjusted.
---
Lol his insults should manifest and become weapons.  Like Silvertongue on Doom Patrol.

---
I really want match making to make its way into the game. Wether specific events or for free playing together. Would be a great way to meet other players
---
I noticed this with my 200% repaired fire axle during a queen fight last night. I have consistently been able to complete the event from less than 200 percent  with plenty of durability to spare, but last night it went from 200% to broken half way through the fight.
---
Good loot, to keep playing the game, to get better loot...in a game where you would choose other games for the world or gameplay.
---
I’m sorry that you can’t see the flaw in your logic.
---
But best of luck grinding for the loot you want.
---
I do the event, but only if I have 5 friends online. The bm players ruin the event otherwise. The ratio of people who actually try to kill it, and activate pylons is too small compared to the ones who stand over your body when your downed and wait for your bag so they can loot it.
---
Yup I'm acadian from the lake Charles area.
---
this
---
I'm confused.  My irl name is Young Kim.  JSevatar is just a username I use on reddit.
---
You should not need to server hop to complete dailies or lookup guides to complete, it should be clear-cut on how to achieve it, it is not supposed to be a puzzle.
---
We had several people do that last week! Feel free to do so otherwise join the fight! It's more fun to participate I promise!
---
Someone alert u/srgrafo! Another one of his ~~comics~~ SEQUENTIAL ARTS became a meme
---
Duplicates shouldn't even exist. I'm level 150+ and don't have all the perk cards yet, but have many duplicates. Why?!
---
I don’t wanna get all on Bethesda’s ass and conspiracy theory about this being intentional so people spend money on repair kits, but i heard about it from a friend too and now people here...
---
Players wanted endgame besides sbq, Bethesda listened. Its a good thing.
---
Don’t worry, Initiate. You’ll get the hang of it. Ad victoriam!
---
There is no flaw dude. Some people liek grinding for loot for the sake of loot itself. Don't try and belittle me because you enjoy games in a different way kid.
---
I’m supporting you saying to the guy that we don’t have to put real names as usernames on reddit. Great art BTW
---
Seriously. The animation even follows it to the ground, than poof
---
There's seriously like a dozen perks that will help you with this. Not even including gear and serums. If you don't just build for Max DPS you can have a far more enjoyable game experience
---
Is that so?
---
I mean, that's not a numbers thing. More of a 'entire way the game is built, hosted, load/population balanced' thing.
---
There is that.
---
I admit that I'm getting a bit bored of it after only a few weeks, even though mine is nowhere near a perfectly optimized variant. I'm typically running around with unarmed strength perks even though I'm mostly using my rifle or Fire axe, because even with the wrong perks MOBs are mostly an irritant.
---
When I run into a gang of Col. Gutsy or high level super mutants with gatlings I get nervous because they can chew health quickly from a distance, but even the Deathclaw, Yao Guai, and Mirelurk Queen adds at the SBQ are butter to my bloodied axe.
---
load up while you can because I'm sure this will get nerfed quick
---
feral ghoul across the map: spawns

I believe there's a couple hanging up at the freakshow. It's been awhile maybe mistaken. I remember a honeybeast carcass in a trailer too.
---
oh haha ok, thanks!
---
You don’t get the point here. Of course they’re still doable, but they’re getting indeed harder and harder and you have to invest more possible game time into the daily’s. Just a question of time when the weekly challenges will be time consuming too. And no, it’s not THAT easy to lure a legendary near a fissure site... a month ago I did the daily’s in around 20-30 minutes, some without even looking first. But the times of „kill 5 supermutants“ or „drink a nuka cola“ seem to be over, because they want to make more money out of atom purchases.
---
Oh, one of my friends just mentioned that the dev´s spoke about Megabases and we think that they meant the workshops. Haven´t had a look at the budget of a workshop and I think it´s difficult to build a team base on a workshop, because as soon as you lock out the workshop is gone.
---
Also we just saw a youtube video where someone claimed that the budget is always the same but the amount of budget an item takes away decreases when you level up. But that would mean that someone lower level placing an item into a base of someone higher level would use up more budget and vice versa.
---
Not familiar with the area but thanks anyway
---
Repair kits still drop. BETTER ones than you can buy drop. You were acting like they don't drop. They do. Cheers.
---
Workshops, i capture 6 workshops in survival mode and just go between them all for the defend events. Each one pretty much yields somewhere between 500-1000 xp without calculating the xp gained from kills
---
I'm quite lucky actually. Anyway i got it.took me 32 server hops.
---
Thats the exact reasons I prefer the plasma. 
---
I have batteries not included so both are light. Plasma cores are just a bit easier to craft (and have overcharged, so less reload) 
---
The laser feels more accurate to me though.
---
Well, speaking of lore isn’t it reasonable that after the vault opened the dwellers started to repopulate/explore/establish humans there again. Along the way it made Whitesprings a hub and so each faction sent a representative there.
---
This change has nothing to do with Bethesda or fallout. It just happens that it is the first day of PSN's new policy if allowing users to change their PSN id.  Pretty sure Xbox live has had a policy allowing you to change gamertag for awhile now (first time is free, after that it's like $10).
---
So again, this has nothing to do with Bethesda working with anyone to let you change your name, it is just consoles letting people change their id/gamertag on their online services, and since those IDs are used as your screen name in every game on those services, it has the side effect of changing your display name in fallout.
---
True but they're things that should simple like the plots it would keep safer from getting destroyed by enemies and other players... Like and indoor garden
---
Definitely hoarding the 2\*\* and 3\*\*\* I find -- I think I read somewhere that we will be converting them into tokens to use at the legendary vendor.
---
Thanks that makes sense.
---
yeah those things are gnarly. I remember fighting them right out of the Vault and hopped up on something to get some distance so I could shoot them. That's when I learned they can jump...ugh
---
I run a defensive support gunner (medic?) And those col gutsy still chew me up. I wonder what their inate armor pen is.
---
I believe they were talking about vault raids not this dungeon
---
Aaaaand you got downvoted already... man some folks literally don’t want to see/ believe this. I mean, it’s a popular thing in online games, that the difficulty of getting such currencies to buy stuff from the in game store are getting harder with time... sadly bethesda is on the same road
---
That would be honestly amazing i didn't think of this.
---
Are yall trading with players who walk up asking while playing the game?
---
The Fallout universe is pretty different from ours. Europe basically collapsed into a bunch of small warring states years before the Great War, and the U.S. was *very* heavy on American patriotism and xenophobia. I doubt you’d find many real non-American flags in the hills of Fallout’s West Virginia.
---
When you place it the name is just Power Armor. 
---
If you drop it instead of placing it the name resets. I think they’re dropping it instead.
---
If you're going to be too much of a whiny bitch to something as OUTRAGEOUS as asking other people for help or hopping servers a few times then at that point it's YOUR choice to not finish those challenges for the day.  This isn't another instance of having to pray for a fucking rad storm, the only thing keeping you from completing almost every challenge today is your own unwillingness.
---
I really like the idea but not sure how it will work in the current server situation. Maybe when they release Wastelanders.
---
Woah...I’ve also noticed this... repair kits are coming 😩
---
Minutemen radio?
---
We will see. I cant imagine this wont be instances otherwise you have a cave meant for 2 to 4 people being decimated by 16 or 20.
---
Damn, all the recipes?  RNGsus gave me several dupes, so I'm still missing Mountain Honey moonshine.  Firecracker whiskey and the mixed drinks that use it are apparently bugged and no one has them yet?
---
I have a suspicion of that too hehe.
---
Whitesprings since clearing the golf club is when I usually end up the most over encumbered and in need of a vendor.
---
It’s slightly offset for me as well.
---
Yea, an event no one is interested in... I wonder HOW they could get people interested in doing it... maybe they could make it part of a challenge?
---
I've said it once and I'll keep saying it. If they're worried about low level characters farming cranberries for the xp boost than they should add in region based plants to the camp build menu. So if you're camp is in the Savage Divide you can plant carrot flowers but not snaptail reeds, in the Forest snaptail reeds and not carrot flowers and etc. Obviously more than just one specific plant per region. I dont think it would make sense to be able plant cranberries in the Ash Heap.
---
can't put my jetpack on that I bought... :(
---
A nice chrome BOS logo on the wall of my camp, would of been epic actually
---
I brew 10 drinks in my sleep!  Easiest challenge ever.
---
Your English is very good. I wish you the best of luck with getting atoms. One suggestion i have for you is to try Amazon or a similar vender to it in Japan they might have a physical card with atoms that you can buy.
---
I'll go flesh over insect any day of the week..
---
Mutant, miner, ghoul or you taste better than that mosquito stir fry.
---
I know, it’s practically stuck in the 1950s but just saying. It’d make sense if after all the bombs fell everyone that was hiding their identities could live free and hang the flags that have been chilling in the deep corners of their basement
---
just out here feeling bad for the lad who was all confused @ me buying 20 egghead serums for this
---
I've only read news here and there on passing, but is it still a sort of you can mod at your own risk and if its deemed to be a cheat you can be banned? It makes sense in an online game since cheats can skew things quickly. But I more meant things such as better graphic/texture mods, perhaps things such as the cbbe or outfit retextures, or even the def ui item sorting etc.
---
As for private servers, I only have heard of them through Warcraft. Essentially an area where something is locked to a certain patch? Why is that beneficial? I'm legitimately curious since its typically said to be a good thing. And at last, would there be any real modding benefit to getting the game through steam instead of the bethesda launcher? Of course besides having most of your games under one launcher. Thanks
---
I bet not. I think this is one of the reasons the change was made - serums being sold too cheaply online.
---
Best of luck :). Hopefully they read it (I used to work in support, trigger finger at the ready for canned responses) and provide a solution.
---
It's too easy in my opinion. The ai behavior for the robots needs to be more agressive.
---
Quad Teslas are super pricey right now. I've been looking too.
---
Lol it still amazes me how many people still don't know how perks work even after 150 levels.Fact is you have at least level 1 in every perk in the game once you've reached level 50 and spent 50 perk points.Learn to use the filters and scroll through your perks bro.
---
Bethesda don’t tell me u tryna pull a sneaky with this repair kit shit
---
I posted about this and crossed my fingers it would be taken care of in the maintenance but iwas wrong. Its really frustrating when you have a mob coming at you and only fire one round and have to re spool bavk up to continue firing.
---
You said “There isn’t enough content in the game...” and added a player can go from level 1 to the Queen in a week.
---
There’s some rushed power-levelling there, and missed content.  
---
Also, if you like grinding for loot but you don’t like the grind, what does that tell you?
---
Can confirm armor too. I tried putting a dense mod onto a 3\* marine that dropped today.
---
It's the best exp grind in the game. It's honestly not worth killing the boss over killing the adds.
---
total opposite of SBQ. Not that great health but one shots like a little bitch
---
I hope not, this would suck.. I will check it out tonight.
---
Any acknowledgement on the friends list being completely unusable now? /u/Ladydevann
---
There is no sorting whatsoever. And many people are still experiencing the "failed to add friend" bug that prevents them from adding anyone to their friends list.
---
Also, if you want to platinum the game you need to get to level 100.
---
The rate of 3*s should be increased for sure.
---
Honestly from crafting it yourself. Get the plan and craft away. Farming them from drops is too inconsistent.
---
Yeah. I’m thinking along similar lines- takes maybe caps and/or semi precious items and you can re-roll legendary effects. It would be super great if you could pick which effects you want. Or maybe take the effects you have and apply them to a new weapon?  Hard to say
---
How are people having trouble killing this thing. it's considerably easier than the Queen and gives the best exp.
---
Diseases definitely seem a bit off at the moment. It seems like diseased enemies now have a disease aura that lets them infect you without actually attacking or hitting you.
---
What's the max?
---
I love it! That's a great idea
---
ok, the tactics I've been using is becoming the conduit for all 3, and then keeping mostly out of the fight and making sure I am still alive.
---
It frees up everyone else to hose him for as much time as possible.
---
Its probably just a stability thing so they set the cap relatively low to test the waters.
---
If they set it high and it turned out the be a big problem it could be bad for the servers in general. Which aren't great to begin with.
---
Well since there's no slap damage in adventure mode unless the other person attacks you back you can't kill them, before it would deal slap damage and so you could kill than bad it would give you a bounty
---
Expect more of it since Bethesda removing the big attraction to survival mode:  the caps. 
---
Killing a high level player in surivial used to be quite profitable. Now, killing a lvl 200 will get you a measly 50 caps, split between your entire team.
---
I don't. I like exploring west virginia in the company of others, seeing their camps, etc.
---
Yeah I want the paint on my TSE and IE.
---
I like a grind which is different than having a 0.01% chance of getting anuthimg worth keeping. You have made an ass of yourself. Congratulations.
---
Why buy them when you can easily farm dozens a day?
---
The pylons... You must not be helping as a conduit at all.
---
Fair enough; but I wouldn't say the current design is really engaging or functional.
---
But a lot of that comes down to the combined mechanics; location based, spoiler timer (that spoils faster if you fast travel), most items require multiple spoilable and location sensitive materials, etc. 
---
Adding a quality of life change that alleviates some of that bad gameplay loop should be embraced. Even if initially implemented with a low availability limit. IE: 1-2 per camp. I'm certain once the QoL improvement aspect is seen by the many, it'd be more easily adopted and requested. 
---
But then again some people don't mind added grind style gameplay loops. I hate them in games like 76, but don't mind turning my brain off and grinding in games like Minecraft or Ark.
---
Invisible enemies.
---
I've got 35 three star weapons put aside and probably about 10 three star armour pieces. I'm gonna laugh if keeping that weight does not pay off lol.
---
Some do but it's not a great way to sell or buy items. Most people use looking for groups sites or trading subreddits
---
No specific enemy drops a specific legendary.  Its all RNG.
---
Yea, I upvoted too, 10/10
---
Should have posted legendary in the title.
---
Well I did run around Morgantown with the Instigating rolling pin the event dropped for me braining scorched and saying "Here's biscuits" so i got some fun out of a shit drop before i sold it.
---
woah woah woah, you got gold!
---
N'awww, a downvote! That's it! Just like the original poster, I'm done! Goodbye! 
---
Curtain call! Exit stage right! Got to be over dramatic when I don't like something! Don't try to stop me! I'm using 50% more exclamation marks than I normally do! Byeeeee!!!🖐🖐🖐
---
New boss event is godly exp. Leveled twice the last time I did it.
---
Want more?  I'll be on in the morning and will sell you all you can afford at 200c each.
---
Something like 25-40. I didnt exactly count but its not a lot.
---
And why haven't you been going around all the numberous post about this subject that have been posted since game launch to enlighten all the others people that have saying what i posted in my original comment?
---
Because, it's not my own opinion or anything like it. I simply kinda copy pasta what haf been previously posted by others.
---
The radio always seems to stop working for like 20 minutes after like 3 songs.
---
if you’re on XB1 sure lmao. I’ll hit you up later
---
They might have went too low but the cap cost beforehand was unsustainable. Not to mention most dedicated pvp players juat stored caps on a mule.
---
They needed to just put in a hard limit. Instead of letting the cost raise forever.
---
PS4 sadly.
---
can cofirm. mirelurk kings just refuse to leave the grove for some reason
---
Oooh yeah nobody drop them. Sketchy business. Already read of somebody getting a disconnect while they were dropped, buh-bye PA sets.
---
Looks stupid haha
---
Twitch- username is Birdman805, might change the name for the fight organization. I’ll keep you posted :)
---
What's the max? I'm about to name my 50th PA so I'd like to know where I gotta stop lol
---
I'm online right now
---
It'd be nice if you could also 'plant' some of the location sensitive ingredients seeing as your camp can determine whether or not you are beside a lead node or an acid node and give you the proper extractor option.
---
Camping in the Ash Heap? You can plant Blight. Camping in the Swamp? You can plant Strangler plants. Camping in the Cranberry Bog? You've got cranberries. So on and so forth; including the option of aquatic plants if you've got a body of water within your camp limits.
---
You're not alone.
---
youtube is my custom radio station
---
Do you have what it takes????
---
Same here. My all rise was done halfway in
---
They're probably holding out to make hud and flashlight color customizable via atom shop, which would be fine by me.
---
Has any other gunslinger noticed that the ultracite laser pistol seems to also not benefit from gunslinger in single fire receivers? Seems wrong that my normal lad or pistol has almost 2x the damage.
---
You've gotta be close. I felt like it was less than 50.
---
Dang man I need that tag of yours, bought the raider icon in the shop forever ago.
---
Ah for legendaries its just farm regular legendary locations, whitesprings, harpers ferry and of course west tek. If you don't want max leveled uranium fever is also good. Got 3 of my best items from it.
---
I personally have the best luck at west tek for natural legendary spawns.
---
change your flair on the sidebar.
---
because after you have sold 1400 worth to the vendors, and can STILL sell serums for 250 each?
---
How
---
I am stepping down. I said that. I have no issue with being expected to while on the team. My issue was with being singled out.
---
I'm gonna run a test real quick
---
I know there's a need. That's why I was doing what I could *during* work, which I shouldn't have to do. As I said, I am stepping down.
---
I did not know this; awesome!
---
You can get one of the miner's helmets with the lamp on it to change it to just white.
---
antibiotics are BROKEN, they make you MORE likely to get diseases.
---
No, man. I know how to use the filters. It's not there.
---
Ad Victorium, Brother!
---
Only if you did it poorly. Top of the world to whitesprings, to watoga, to harpers ferry. For responders just go the vault 76 and go to the airport.
---
You're welcome :)
---
That event outfit is pimpin’ though!
---
Xbox 1 I can confirm. Cant install my mods on weapons (sledge and knuckles)
---
No guy. I have been a conduit all three times I have done the event for the entire fight. It does almost no damage to me with 700 energy resistance. The only thing in the whole event that can potentially kill me is the bosses melee, which a single marsupial jump de-aggros. You people keep talking about wasting chems, but really your putting no effort into the event and expecting it to be a cake walk Zerg.
---
It's a spawn for the end of one of the "Unsolved" side quests of the new Sheepsquatch quest.
---
Yay!
---
Well, that's just another broke mechanic that's been there since beta. If you're broke you can keep attacking someone (or seeking revenge in adventure mode) without risk while the person you're attacking will lose their normal amount. 
---
There needs to be a bankruptcy penalty applied, at least in adventure.  The significant reduction in caps payout in survival has lessened the amount of broke players there since the risk is now significantly less.  
---
What id prefer to see is PvP more balanced. Be more about skill, not gear, and this is said as someone who's harvested a mountain of caps and aid from survival.  There's also several exploits that desperately need addressed in survival mode.
---
Idk why it happens but I wouldn't complain
---
Yes! It would make camp decorations much more interesting
---
So, Shielded lining on it is basically the same as the 76 vault suit? Stat-wise?
---
Fluffy is a mutant bear created pre-war by a scientist who’s name I can’t remember. It’s part of the Sheepsquatch quest.
---
because it's easier to just leave them out sadly.
---
This idea is as old as the game itself.
---
Just keep an eye on it next time. It really behaves just like a normal assaultron with cloaking ability: It seems to just periodically cloak and de-cloak, maybe on a timer with a cooldown? When the pylons aren't active I have seen it de-cloaked, and cloaked, but it has a shimmering energy shield surrounding it at all times. Also, the moment all 3 pylons are activated there is a blue column of light that flashes upward from the 'Squatch an is meant to be it's shield collapsing. I think that also temporarily knocks out it's cloaking ability, though it regains it's use of it after a little while. I had a match where a single tank player activated all the pylons themself, then sat on the roof of the shack in stealth popping stims all match and didn't die once. The Sheepsquatch definitely cloaked off and on, but was still vulnerable to damage. ;)
---
Happened to my buddy for Uranium Fever. Got hella lucky
---
Can confirm the limit is 50
---
The way they've done it with 76 doesn't bother me, it's not weapons or armour, and there's no subscription fee like in WoW, etc so they have to make money somewhere. It is a business after all.
---
What a major shame. I'm a new player, just hit level 20 last night and I'm really starting to enjoy this game after months of having it sit in my game library because I didn't enjoy it.
---
This is a mistake for them to make themselves liars about the microtransactions being cosmetic only. Them making weapons degrade quicker to encourage spending money on repair kits is scummy af.
---
I just set up camp on that exact spot yesterday (to the left when crossing the bridge). I've been hoarding like crazy and managed to fill up my stash with mostly ammo and junk components already, at level 17, so I thought I might as well find a spot where I can leave some goodie bags and other resources for new players (my karma is too low to get much for selling it anyway).
---
Just confirmed 50 is max
---
I mean there’s no concrete proof but as soon as there is I’m outta here.
---
stupid comment haha
---
I'm all for end game content. But I feel this dude has a tad too much health. With 10+ people murdering him his hp barely goes down while he Is vulberable
---
Oh I haven't started that quest yet.
---
Okay I guess they set its spawn near my camp, I should probably move it. Thanks everyone, mystery solved.
---
Yeah my first thought was, how would you print them realistically? Having it be a quiet reward is a great idea
---
I make sure I am the conduit for all 3 pylons, because I can keep alive, and it means everyone else can kill the critter easy.
---
It is when the conduits keep dying it becomes hard.
---
Been happening on PS4 occasionally for a while now too.
---
Congrats! Now if you’re in for a real challenge, I just secured nuclear codes for the first time...
---
Thank you god
---
No dude... Almost noone has that much energy resistance. Just beacsue you ajve that doesnt mean other people arent putting in effort bur we arent going to completely respeec to do one event. I have full Sentinal and refractor and I,still get melted.
---
I had a CAMP just north of there for awhile. Loved all of the fireflies!
---
Because they are assholes. haha
---
I learned the assaultron weapon plan and it said I got the imposter sheepsquatch, but I can't craft it. Must've been a glitch.
---
I agree but honestly with server conditions lag can play a big part in who wins. I don't know if this gane can support properly skill based balanced game play.  The mapa are too big, and the gameplay infrastructure isn't designed for it. Not to mention the number of perks and possible interactions.  At least with costs being low you can keep survival servers populated. The aid loss is still a deterrent for me personally as a medic build who hoards too much to always stash away.
---
Gear helps a lot but outside of a few combinations sentinel/assassins it seemed like you could get kills pretty easily if you got the jump on them. 
---
I would personally prefer cap losses stay at like 100. Splitting it between party members is fair since thats a penalty you get from teaming up. You get an advantage in combat, but the risk to you is greater since if you die its takes more effort to break even.
---
You call that lucky? I'd hate to see you on a BAD day, lol. Anyway, I'm glad it finally worked for you. Probably still easier than the alternative ways. ;)
---
&gt;!Spoilers!&lt;
---
Awww hoped it was an exploit I could use
---
But killing in survival is a lot more easy
---
&gt;  server side low dpi images
---
Maybe this could work.
---
Besides selling to players letting you exceed the robot's daily caps limit, the removal of easy hat-caps and addition of the new Lying Lowe cap-sink quest should make caps more valuable, so I think you'll still find sellers.
---
In there most recent live stream someone in the chat brought it up and bethesda acknowledged it and said they're aware etc. So hopefully it'll be getting fixed soon, fingers crossed.
---
I kinda like it. once it moves, it means it will teleport you straight into the event, not out at the entrance. also happens with the horde events, once the leader pops, you can see the quest marker moving. no more 3-4 fast travels to hunt it down
---
Same! That's why I had to regain my sanity by posting it here
---
No. No it's not. 
---
In adventure you can stalk your prey and keep track of them because they're marked on the map (unless they're crouching).  If they're in their shop, you can pretty much be guaranteed to have the jump on them even if they see you because you get to decide when PvP starts and they don't have much time to react, none if you're prepared and can kill them quickly.
---
My gatling plasma sometimes just empties my entire clip when firing like ill go from 150 shots left to 0 instantly and it fires a giant burst. (Not equal to what was consumed. 
---
I would have prefered the other reloading glitch even though they called it an exploit as if firing 8 free shots was worth the hassle of your weapon never being ready. It already comes with a long wind up.
---
I've also noticed this and I'm catching diseases like its hookers birthday party,
---
That just makes it a challenge nobody is interested in doing lol.
---
eh even with grounded and refractor (also have about 700 energy resistance + med x you will still have to heal up some times or got some vampire mini or something. Yeah it's doable but not easier than the queen fight. SBQ you can fight with no hands, Parkinson and being blindfolded. It's literally spamming attacks on a giant hit box, it just takes more hits...
---
Lol ya that's it...well either you are using mods or something that's messing up your game or you just don't know how to cycle through perks.All you have to do is pick it when you have a free point.
---
I discovered It a few days ago and i'm only using it for the great blinding flashlight. My eyes start to cry sometimes when i turn It on
---
I liked the other glitch I could play around it at least.
---
Nope, just wolf, yao guai, owlet, and rad stag
---
I will settle for robot followers instead like Automatron.
---
First anti armor does not work for energy weapons.
---
Are there even any reliable ones left?
---
What, why....
---
I'm not playing a lot in adventure so i'm not sure, But the other player needs to respond to start a fight, right?
---
Aye, that's all I have found
---
Careful not to cut yourself with all that edge
---
Ok
---
No armor PIERCING perks or effect work for energy. 
---
Second sentinel is deactivated if you get crippled or staggered.
---
20 hours, total.
---
And that’s really funny you say that. I study about 2 hours a week on my own and the first hour is doing exactly what you said re: filling pages with Hiragana! Very cool.
---
Ive gotten to where when i run out of ammo, i swap weapons fast and then swap back and itll be full. SOMETIMES the one shot glitch doesnt happen. Sometimes it does. I wish more people cared about the issue so Bethesda would take notice and do something about it.
---
If they don't own a shop, yes. If they do own a shop, then no. Anyone on your team can contest the shop, making the owner immediately hostile to your entire team, regardless of where they are on the map.
---
Firefly from a random drop playing the event.
---
Maybe this could be a function of the new camera item
---
Very good post. +karma
---
Second energy weapons are awful. I mained them because I love energy weapons. I have one semi-useful one a explosive gatling plasma. 
---
I have a vicious laser rifle, heavily modded, it can't kill a level 1 sorched in one shot.
---
I won't. Thanks for the concern.
---
Some areas are barely above water, so it still views it as a water source. The nice thing about this is you might be able to put a purifier there. 
---
So I'd just move the foundation
---
haha yes indeed
---
Honestly I’d love a tab for:
---
QUEST (items, so I don’t scrap)
---
KEYS (sortable by RECENT and OLDEST)
---
HOLO (sortable by RECENT and OLDEST)
---
PLANS 
---
I know that’s a lot of clutter for the scrolling menu, but honestly I’d take a few more sections over ever having to search through the lists again.
---
Also, moving relevant holotapes to the top of the list (Supply Requisitions, games, quest-related) would be awesome for terminals, but I get that it could be hard to do.
---
I had a glitch where I was losing hp really fast immediately after spawning. It wasn't the invisible assaultron attacking me or the bots. I'd run away from the commotion with no enemies around and lost hp at the same rate. After about 20 deaths I got the infinite loading screen..
---
Thank you sir, your input is greatly appreciated!
---
AA counter the shield def value, energy weapons are negated by the bolt def value.
---
And excavator! Or was it 35...
---
Its because energy weapons are bad and only us foolish people main them. 
---
I can't help it, i know they are awful, but... the lasers, plasma, the pew pew, its so cool.
---
You obviously dont have the right lasers lol
---
Your telling me that almost no lv50+ can't make leather armor, get 1 mutation, and bring a few chems for damage reduction? Ok. 🤣
---
That wont get you 700 energy resist. Youre full of it.
---
Last update broke mods. Its a known issue. It'll be fixed... sometime.
---
Queen? Lol
---
