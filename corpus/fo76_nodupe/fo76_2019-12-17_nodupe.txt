Did you complete the other two with it? You have to complete 3 of the listed things to get the atoms.
---
---
---
Pass on that. Good thing there’s no anti cheat stuff then. 
---
The prices will get driven down to reasonable prices if the weapons become available again (legit ones!)  I saw someone charging 200 pounds/maybe 250 dollars of real money for a weapon 
---

---
Beyond ridiculous.
---
Go to a vendor bot and look at the misc tab. You can buy the wrapping papers to craft gifts. Use chemist perk to make double. 
---
Or you can farm scorched. Those jingle jangle scorched drop gifts as well. 
---
Open them up to learn plans.
---
I forgot about the infinite carry weight bug, haha.
---
This is a great build... I really admire camps that can look so liveable and inviting. The fireplace is a nice touch.
---
my homie has a private server,  it's still recycled which is lazy on their part.  Ill find unused extractors in a workshop we've never been too in that playthrough.  Secondly, the forward camp should have a small building area to place maybe turrets and a few crafting tables  and barricades.  Or making the private servers persistant? If i'm shelling out \~$100 don't destroy the world when i leave.  Thanks.
---
You got attacked by a beaver.  What next, someone is going to claim they were one-shotted by a chicken?
---
I think that may be what the guy was getting at i admit it was more fun when u could get any gun u wanted from a duper and not trade ur soul for it weight limit dindnt matter cuz u could drop it and get another if needed not that im saying we should all start duping but there is a problem when a gun costs more than the money limit
---
Not really. These are weapons with in-game authentic stats. Others will make the 10 star weapons instead. If no one wamts to dupe that weapon to bring the market down then it'll forever be high.
---
I knew it!
---
Ok everyone.... I’m back to max caps in just that short span of time. Guess I’m buying more wrapping paper lol
---
Got multiple spawns for about 2 hours this morning and didn't leave the first corridor. Kill one wave, pick ultracite, repeat.  Got 17 small presents, 9 regular and 4 large. In a group, didn't kill the scorchbeast, ps4.
---
I think the money limit is a waste of time for every character anyways. I think its the bigger issue.
---
To much work... 
---
15$ skin take it or leave it
---
Looks fine to me.
---
&gt; I just heard (on the radio, oddly) that the latest patch broke legendary armor; reloading your weapons causes the damage stat to plummet. 
---
Hello.  Welcome to the patch before last.
---
Haven’t played in a bit. What are you guys going broke over?
---
Most likely. Though there's some odd times when a low level mutie would spawn (usually 10) , but then later encounters would be of a higher level (48 - 60+). I find this often at Huntersville, starting at the road going up towards the town.
---
Holiday wrapping papers
---
Almost never seen one
---
While farming Morgantown airport I had level 68 scorched spawn lucky I was on my main, because my other character is level 30
---
What a cool thing to do. My wife just set an alarm to go visit you tomorrow lol.
---
Since this event started I have seen a bunch of normal legendary scorched, whereas before I saw maybe 4 or 5 in 700+ hours. It may be a side effect of the holiday event though and go back to being the way it was.
---
Worked for me too, I'm hoping that when wastelanders comes out there's a little slot machine section at the raiders base. Something to throw caps at when you have too much.
---
yes and yes
---
Do the quest there and all the robots will leave you alone
---
With concentrated fire, 33% added to headshots is clutch...
---
back in my day you couldn't step foot on the whitespring grounds without being 1 shotted from the roof by a two shot explosive.
---
The wall thing just needs you to restart the game, moving your camp would be an overreaction
---
[removed]
---
Back in my day
---
 \~ 
---
 player.setav  100000000
---
I would actually even prefer that over a 25% discount!
---
Pretty sure it's a hangover from way back I'm the day. If you do it with strangers you can see the stuff they are pulling out.
---
Pretty sure Its loot is based off of server not your time like most everything else is.
---
I'll take the copper and you can have the rest?
---
¿Que?
---
PvP without commando is self-nerfing. Most people who pvp have specific sets of armor and fast fire weapons who kill you fast enough to feel you were oneshot.
---
I like to take workshops and run with vanguard doing its job. Just for fun.
---
Change it up sometimes though, I mean, who doesn't want to see a Super Mutant dressed as a Leprechaun or Easter Bunny?
---
Sure, but then why are we celebrating faschnat, Halloween, thanksgiving, and then Christmas? Yes, it’s that time in the real world but it’d sure as hell be ore immersive if the game reflected that.
---
Are you a follower of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster?
---
Looks fine.   
---
Minor possible tweaks - demo expert doesn't provide a huge bonus for most weapons so those points might be better allocated elsewhere.  Travelling pharmacy and bandolier seem unnecessary as this is a non pa build so I assume at least partial unyielding - your carry weight will be solid so again maybe those points could be allocated elsewhere.  
---
But those are mostly  nitpicks.
---
Yes ! The pasta jar will provide.
---
Heh...looks like I dodged the charismatic bullet there lol... I stocked up on my charisma m8
---
Me too.
---
¿Battle Royale Fallout 2 es?
---
Heh... dodged the charismatic bullet there lol
---
Fixed spawns dont work for taming.
---
Launcher has been wonky since free weekend. If you're on PC launch from the .exe
---
Nice way to speak to your kid Mom .. what a whack job .. geez have some nukashine already ..
---
Now \*this\* is the type of grade A top notch quality suggestion that I can get behind.    
---
Take an updoot my fellow vault dweller.
---
Me too honestly. Ive got a mule full of scrip that ive been trying to peddle into the machines, but these back to back events and holidays are impeding the process. I actually think ive lost ground. Lol.
---
Thanks dude!
---
close the launcher, also in the system tray..try again
---
You sound like an idiot.  Please remember not to run with sicsors, you might hurt yourself or someone else.
---
You on Xbox?

The encryptid event is as rare as your willingness to pay for the recall cards

PM Sentinel Looch for enlistment details (Discord Looch#7529).
---
Noticed it too.
---
Get or wear all unyielding gear and play at 20% health. This will give you +15 intelligence and a 30% XP boost at all times. Along with all the other methods posted should level you up pretty fast
---
Yup I’ve def experienced this. It’s a pain when ur in combat.
---
What do you mean cover ?
---
I made it less than 24 hours ago on ps4
---
Yeah max unyielding and I have radicool as well. I suppose I could try moving most of my meds to a different character and dropping travelling pharmacy to 1, I rarely use stims anyway unless I need to use PA for Meltdown.
---
Ramen.
---
You've convinced me.
---
Oh I was devastated after I did that lol
---
Thanks for clearing it up
---
It is really annoying. Did it glitch into a tree or did you place it there? I was thinking of a tree house build at some point. I do really like the Mire though. Its the only place where nighttime is actually dark. I might move my camp out that way since it looks like moving is the only fix. Do you find you have really high level things invading your camp?
---
Insert "let me in" meme here.
---
Right?! Anything for people that pay extra. I bet if I had Fallout 1st they would fall all over themselves to help!
---
I’ve given away most of the plans and really kinda stopped picking them up when I already know them. The ones I do pick up I’ll lost em for 25c until I find a nice young soul to give them to
---
I got two of those rare baseball bats.
---
Back in my day. We had spurs that jingle jangle jingled. Water chips always broke. And we always tried to take all the gold in the Sierra Madre.
---
They've also used fallout 3, 4, and new Vegas footage before

Pandering at its finest.

I talked to a guy that posted here the pics  of his challenges all done beside and raid. I only have the wood left myself and he said he just made laps every 3 hours at wood locations.
---
I got tips and tricks to speed up or completely cheat every challenge, but the wood one is just a straight grind.
---
Honestly. They just need to tweak the numbers and make it a monthly thing all year round. Next month is new year. Fire works and beer. February: candy hearts and valentines. Etc...
---
Ay bruh ill take em off ur hands if you're ps4, ive still got alot of plan searching to do ay lmao
---
And if you empty them out you can server hop to get more.
---
nice, old mumbles definitely seems to go on streaks from time to time.
---
Same. I used to drop 10 a month. In just atoms but with the 1650 I only need the 400 deal. Tbh I want a 1st skin for the combat rifle or something like that.
---
I’m on Xbox man. Sorry
---
Nah
---
Lol.
---
Sometimes the glitches are good for the little guy.
---
This and no armour deterioration bug were great while they lasted.
---
Not that my armour takes much of a hit now anyway (stealth sniper looking to be a stealth commando with my bloody FFR combat rifle)...it was great for my non-stealth pistol build though.
---
If you want to describe the real economics it isn't that simple -- you could start talking about hyperinflation...
---
A simple fix that the incompetents can't or won't do.
---
It’s definitely a decent game- it has its bugs and trouble but it’s still a fun game. If you can find some people to play with it’s even better. I would recommend it if you can find it on sale.
---
I dont mind people enjoying Fallout, but imagine Fallout being a paper towel if you wet that paper towel it's not good at all that's how alot of people feel about FO76 and even FO4 if you Fallout 1,2, and or NV you would get what I'm saying the stories are dumb down to such a level it can't even tell a compelling story honestly no story in Fallout 76 had me feel immersed the only story I had really felt was the Morgantown Airport even then it's more like reading/Listening to a book no good NPCs and I can guarantee the ones coming in Wastelanders will be like Preston Garvey or Porter Gaige from Nuka World.
---
More Beth failure!
---
I'd buy THAT for a dollar!
---
No wonder I had to repair strangler heart earlier than I thought
---
You are talking about changing weather. You can celebrate a holiday any time of year. You can’t make it snow in October in West Virginia.
---
Million cap Idea!!!
---
We splitting this 50/50?
---
Did you play during the free weekend the past few days? If not seems like you missed your chance to judge for yourself.
---
Can you put a tv in, so I can watch the game?
---
In a lot the speculation I've seen and read about the ash and soot that would be purged into the air would actually block sunlight and would cause temperatures to drop and create colder conditions. Hence the name nuclear winter.  But that is also a big possiblity.
---
Only place you can store stuff safely in in a stash box. No one can access your items in a stash box. They are yours and saved in the stash box...
---
[winter festive pant suit](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Festive_winter_pant_suit) right?
---
No offense but you're really emotionally deprived sir
---
I just crafted 20
---
Thanks!  
---
Interesting, with something that causes issues to begin with having no "stacking" limit / system to prevent a spamming of the same FX.  
---
  
---
If you don't mind a followup..  
---
What do you use for performance profiling and how much data does it uncover?   
---
Running into an issue with the Fallout76.exe forcing the rendering onto the wrong GPU (GPU1 when it should be GPU0) and no Windows, Nvidia, '76 INI edit will change it, and I've replicated it in a second system with completely different hardware proving it's the EXE and not local software/hardware.  
---
Trying to find ways to trace the issue and find a workaround and looking for more tools.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Thank you again and appreciate the hard work!
---
This is brilliant, worked for me to get the elusive plasma grenade plan.  If anyone is going to try this method just be sure the character is level 4 or lower for best odds.
---
Back in my day we had whole herds of legendaries as far as the eye could see. So many we just gave them away with little thought to the future. Back when white springs was king.
---
My Cousin moved to from Michigan to WV and said it's the same but worse lol 2 foot of snow at 8am by 4 its 75 and sunny
---
One word... Yes
---
I sell mostly ammo and a couple plans. My plabs range from 25 caps to 50 caps.
---
Ya. If you got a real low agility probably helps. You only need the first two kills. I play junkies and energy weapons and get sneaky crits all the time with escape artist.
---
Open in adventure mode? Doubtful. You can explore in nuclear winter obviously they removed door because people were glitching inside somehow.
---
Sounds like a deal to me
---
That is a good idea for those who never had the chance to collect some. However the only question is what price?
---
Thanks!
---
Naaa.  I just carry Corn Soup all day every day.
---
Lol holy hell. We'll get 3 feet of snow at night here then a a bunch of Melting snow around 10 am then by 4 sheets of ice
---
Can multiple people use the same stash box but it only shows their items to them?
---
You really could have stopped after the first paragraph and they would have gotten the message...  all the outrage and gatekeeping over a mundane abbreviation? Pretty unnecessary
---
I am, the wasteland is a terrible place.
---
... can you sell me some emotions? I'll pay caps.
---
Yes if we both interact with the same box, at the same time... I’ll see my stuff and you’ll see yours.
---
Ah the good old days
---
Hackers are trash
---
All stash boxes are connected.
---
Every stash box can only show you your items. If someone looks at a stash box in your camp they'll only see their own items.
---
This is happening to me also, but they are still giving rewards. It’s hard to check XP part but scrip and weapons/aid items are still added to your inventory.
---
Indeed.   I have no idea, but I'm tired of my 23rd Brahmin Head Plan. ;)
---
Ark survival evolved has seasonal textures with different times of the year and I think Fallout 76 should do the same. Every single season should look slightly different, have different weather types and maybe even different fur or skin colors on the creatures as their coats or scales change to the season. Modders will eventually do it if Bethesda doesn't; it's a huge opportunity to draw people in for the seasonal changes ontop of the events.
---
😂😂😂😂😂
---
They scream like an ex-wife and fart radiation. Hardly a prince. Plus they are delicious.
---
Plasma grenade plan is worth it. It’s crazy rare, and has been pulling trades of legacy weapons and good gear before the event. Without it, you can’t finish one of the possum badges.
---
And it would just erase your Camp if someone was in your Camp spot haha
---
Ok got it thx
---
And my unwillingness to solo it.  Which I've tried.  And can't do.  I know others have.  I can't.  Waste of Caps if you look at a half full server, or one filled with low level players, or at best, with a few high levels doing nothing but SBQ nuking runs.
---
I've seen the event fail due to lack of interest far too often to take the risk.
---
After my first (lvl 5) trip to Toxic Vallet, I got scared, and basically soent my first 50 levels doing this a year ago.  
---
It's a superb strat.
---
Yep, running a bloodied build. Be patient and wait for the last horde to spawn before looting the SBQ and if 1st place your tent immediately after the SBQ dies and store the flux before last horde spawn.
---
Ah ok
---
Finally something to do with my 130 repair kits!
---
Yes and no.
---
Respeccing an existing character all at once is a lot faster way to having fun with a new play style than grinding a new character up from level 1 to 50+.
---
A new character CAN be a good way to get new enjoyment from the game BUT the story is still the same as it always was and still on railroads with no choices...so the mileage varies depending on how you deal with that and are feeling.  
---
I enjoyed leveling up my new pistol character BUT that was because I returned to the game after 5-6 months away and wasn’t burnt out on the gameplay.  My pistol character is now a bloody stealth sniper because he died too easily without stealth...and as soon as I get enough commando perks he will be a bloody stealth commando thanks to a bloody FFR combat rifle from a happy vendor last night.
---
I shouldn’t HAVE to start a new character if I don’t feel like it though.
---
- it’s a grind
---
- the story isn’t engaging the second time around (it took serious head canon to make interesting)...let alone a third).
---
- I can’t easily transfer items between characters (should have a central “bank” for all characters)...and the risk of losing the weapon I want to base a whole new build around is very real if you’re not doing it with your best real life friend.
---
I’d happily say keep the current “re-spec” system if a few things happened:
---
- new content that changed based on earlier game decisions.  (Suddenly one character could be a raider and another could be a member of the free states, etc).
---
- a central bank/stash for all characters on a player account...limited size and only available from your camp with a new special stash box.
---
- more viable play styles for the end game.  (And an actual end game!).
---
Shotguns absolutely suck and I sold my bloody shotguns I was considering doing a new character for because of this.  
---
Pistols can’t keep up in terms of damage or survivability. 
---
Energy weapons are still not up to par with ballistic.
---
Yeah, that would be nice, but hopefully that would be gated by some content.  I’d like to earn it besides just paying out.
---
lawl
---
In MY DAY, we had to buy overpriced crap from a robot, or do without!
---
There’s also scrip rewards. I think I ended up with 800 scrip from my 40k caps
---
Heh...
---
I just caught a bargain on scrip at a vendor bot. He was selling 1* level 1 weapons for 50 caps.
---
Thanks, glad the hotfix resolved.
---
If you msg me I might be able to hop on sometime for you I'll try to do a little bit later on at night too if I can
---
When you are wielding a junkies weapon, other weapons will display the junkies bonus.  It's a display bug, and equipping the non junkies weapon will cause the proper damage value to appear.
---
Thanks for the update, the success of the hotfix for the durability seems mixed.
---
I just made 5 on ps4 an hour ago.
---
Sorry for the delay, weekend had a ton of adulting.  
---
That is a little insane, what concrete foundations were you using?
---
Loved the 200% armour durability AND DR when fixed with FixIt .... or the boundless legendary ghouls.  That last one feels a lot like this Christmas, Scorched Gift, event.
---
I probably wouldn't have noticed if it was gutsy but the level 1 liberator was a wtf???? Moment. Then I've been farming level 1 scorched (long story) and got killed, then again, and again.
---
Something is definitely off since the update.
---
What are people buying with caps right now?
---
&gt;Never even picked up a gun, just crouched in a bush
---
Wait, this isn't how you're supposed to play NW?
---
Shouldn’t be a scrip or caps limit tbh.
---
SHOULD be anti chest measures that ensure an even playing field but the arbitrary limits on those two currencies make no sense to me.
---
If someone has 150,000 caps and someone has 20,000 caps, the former does not have an advantage over the latter IF the item to buy is priced based on demand, not the highest possible price.
---
I still won’t pay more than 15,000 for a fixer plan for example.  And that’s a big stretch.
---
It won’t ruin the in game economy unless people can quickly cheat to get caps...remove the ability to cheat and the economy remains stable because there is no easy way to suddenly create an influx of new caps into it, which would drive up inflation.
---
Apparently consoles have bad performance.
---
I hope we get some of those players from other mmorpgs that figure out all the formulas and stuff.
---
How dare you ask for clarification that is just blasphemy
---
The holiday wrapping paper so you can craft gifts
---
 I hoping that's level 45 that you mean. ;)
---
I payed the full $60 for the ore order and I will say... I’ve gotten well over $200 worth of a game. Glitches ya, bugs ya, a holes yup. But in the end I still love it for what it is, think of it like a beat up old house, you love it. It may be terrible but it holds great stories and times, and with some work, it can be the perfect place. Don’t get me wrong, you may want to smash up a window or two at times but with how cheap it is it’s well worth the buy. 
---
Ps I have actually never spent a penny on anything other than the game itself so no need to pay extra for the fun
---
Oh no, because they sometimes fail to fix a bug or introduced a new one, the dozens upon dozens of bugfixes they have done in each patch don't count! I forgot, how silly of me.
---
Imagine working at a small studio making a game you have decided you want to make, and then a large company buys you, immediately cancels the game you are working on, gives you a Game Engine made for singleplayer games and tells you to use this engine, which none of you have worked in before, to make a multiplayer game. And their owners in turn cuts down on the development time you asked for because they want money on their investment now.
---
As a former programmer myself, I think these Devs are fuckin' impressive. Bethesda however should have transferred people who worked on this engine before and helped upgrade it for F4 into this team. but they did not. And ZeniMax can just go fuck themselves. But I have nothing but respect for the Austin Studio.
---
I figured not, but something I think would be cool for them to do is allow you to go into the vault in the main mode, and then just move you into nuclear winter. It wouldn't be entirely practical, but neither were the cardboard cutouts for the atomic shop, and at least this one would make more sense.
---
I wont disagree with that but if they did increase i assume everything would rise in price alot and i assume its there becuz back In the old fallouts if you hit a certain number of caps it would kill ur save if i remember
---
I stopped playing after they patched it along with server hopping to get 3star boss kills back to back. I came back for nuclear winter and reached 70+ then left again. Have not returned. Waiting on the Npc update that is overdue.
---
 Yes I too make this humble food and hot key it. ;)
---
I'm game we can replace the fog for it.
---
GTA does it but not nearly long enough.
---
I can't sell a vendor full of plans and recipes at no more than 5 caps. Granted my camp is in the middle of nowhere-ish. I'm like a 5c fast travel away from the purveyor.
---
Well you can price the gifts bases on what the wrapping paper sells for now. So a high quality wrapping paper costs like 1700 or so caps. So for large presents, in the future, can easily be worth like 2200 caps. With the chemist perk (I think) you will make two gifts instead of one when crafting and in return you can make up to 2700 cap profit. 
---
By the time people start to resell gifts, Wastelanders will be out and a lot of new people will probably get into the game. (hopefully)  The new people will probably think it is a super rare (kind of is at that point) item and want to buy the gifts at higher prices. This may seem scummy, but thats how the cookie crumbles. 
---
I want to try and unlock every plan in the gifts then I'm going sicko mode on farming for gifts until the event ends.
---
That's because Todd HATES you.
---
I would rather them focus on bugs first...
---
I am just gonna leave this here:  
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YViAD9MLlZA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YViAD9MLlZA)
---
They could build in better protections against engine exploitation using current existing systems as a basis.
---
Then add in anti-cheat and use the whole shebang as a advertisement feature.
---
No I have all ingredients on my person, still nothing, swapped servers 2 more times even
---
I think the bigger issue is the lack visible weapons here I mean where do you put that Gatling laser or Dragon when your done holding it?
---
Well damn, idk then, it makes the sound like ya crafting them, but gives no xp and none are actually in my inventory when I exit the bench and check
---
At this point, I've got so many one star and trash two stars that I just sell everything at the price given for three machines and the fourth with actually decent items. I've reached peak "cannot be bothered" with that endless scrolling to the same price per scrip that I'm like "23c for a 2* combat knife? Yep, that sounds about right now that I have 74 2* combat knives"
---
At Then if an item is over 15 lbs it's just free; I just like knowing players actually get them vs them despawning eventually without helping someone with their scrip. But every morning I'm at my camp begging for people to take my scrip, like I'm about to pay THEM at this point just to get myself unoverencumbered for two seconds
---
I’m on Xbox and I don’t normally have an issue except sometimes the Queen is laggy
---
Na, I like limited time events. Otherwise they don't feel special.
---
Well I have no clue , I gave up, thanks for the confirmation it's just something on my end tho
---
Cool. Good to know
---
These young punks don’t understand the struggle of the original low  stash limit.  Having to travel all over the map to find the vendors instead of just going to to the white springs mall.    Then while there, getting swarmed by ghouls if you tried to visit the golf course while hoping that someone wouldn’t nuke the place.
---
Wish kotaku would do anything other than talk shit about fallout.
---
A bloodied explosive 10mm. 2 stars. The best part is that my bloodied gunslinger found it, so no server jumping here.
---
I'm level 269 and I stopped caring about leveling up a long time ago. Feels good.
---
Okay, case closed folks, apperantly I'm just shit out of luck for now, thanks for the info👍
---
Noticed it too, along with increase in water/food usage, gotta luv those stealth nerfs.
---
As a West Virginian I can say that all it does is pour the rain anymore. Been raining here the last 5 days and it’s December smh
---
Yeah I know about that but it’s been 25 years since the war so the nuclear fallout would’ve long fallen, so it would just leave the planet hot. Or so I’m assuming
---
Its to sell repair kits
---
❤
---
Yeah, it narrows down the odds a lot. Still the same odds of rolling a weapon plan but if you do get that roll it narrows down the chances of getting the plasma grenade from 1 in 21 down to 1 in 6
---
Playing a role in a story doesn't require talking to humans. Was Tom Thanks not playing a role in Cast Away when was only speak to a volleyball?
---
Did you give your character a name and develop that character's story while taking on quests? Did you become an Enclave general, register as a Responder, Firebreather, Brotherhood of Steel soldier, etc? Assign special attributes to further develop the character as you progressed through the main quest? If so, then you've probably been playing an RPG.
---
I'll have to stop by  sounds fun
---
The only way I found out that Fallout 76 existed was because it came with my Xbox One X. It's my most played game by far.
---
Got'em, Mr. Rico.
---
Have you tried picking it up and placing it down again?  Maybe that will make it despawn the grass?
---
I haven't had a run in with one of these pieces of shit yet, but I have reduced the  time I spend at my camp to avoid it. I can do most everything except reload my vendor at the whitesprings. Sad though.
---
I got 5 boxing gloves , coal and fertilizer.  No gifts.     Guess Santa Tron thinks I really like boxing.
---
No difference in the end. I just did one point in each card for 30% instead of 3 points in one card for 15%.
---
Doggie doggie what now?
---
By 'old' do you mean that the server has been running constantly without a reboot?
---
At first, I would have agreed, but I think what actually happened is that when Unyielding broke in those first couple days, I was forced to play a more physical game with melee, and you end up getting beat on a lot more than when you can just pistol everyone from a nice, safe distance.
---
I was really hoping that is what the Atlas Observitory was going to let you do. Change the weather for an area on the map.
---
I wouldn't mind seeing more legendary mobs at Faschnacht.  And a couple more similar legendary explosion events in the year.
---
This event has flooded the game with legendaries, which has driven down the vending prices, and made GOOD gear available to all, even the RNG challenged.
---
Fully embrace the idea of more legendaries.
---
And you get items from them? I haven't played it in a while
---
If you want a non-cheater experience hit up a console version.  There are nearly daily threads here complaining about the mess that is the PC version.
---
Otherwise you’ve been given solid advice.  Like any game. It’s always better with friends.
---
Gifts are the event.
---
I believe if you max out all 3 cards and equip them you get a total of +75% the 3rd rank in each one is only 5 I think.. I have the level 2 in all 3 combat cards and I think that's how they stack
---
Nellis AFB is &lt;- that way, Boomer
---
Agree
---
Restart the launcher
---
What are the other effects of the shotguns. I have a shotgun build on Xbox I may be interested
---
I like to at least pretend to put up a fight. A rabbit with nasty sharp pointy teeth is a tiny bit less likely to be slaughtered than a normal bunny rabbit.
---
Nothing and depending on your build, you may be better off going with 10-15% damage worth instead of 20% and grab some utility.
---
Oh ok thank you
---
Got it. Thank you
---
oh yeah, blame Bethesda for not understand you own fucking hardware. youre the moron here.
---
I’ve had grahm kill the legendary as I arrive the last 5 times
---
Thanks, I just started from the .exe file. Guessing the saved creds were borked from the free weekend thing?
---
Well it is Appalachia and reclamation day was Oct 23 and its not uncommon for snow in late October there.
---
My favorite game I played was with complete strangers who just invited me to their party after I was put on their team of three. 
---
Game starts, everyone finds a crate and a weapon
---
"Hey, Noddy, you have a weapon? I've got a laser pisto."
---
"The fuck I need a gun for? Can't you see I'm in a bush! Nah, didn't think so."
---
Nope.  Nothing on the keyboard would work at all.  I had to switch my Tartarus to one of it's "XBox default" setting and navigate using keys that I had to figure out what did what.  Once I did that, I was able to go and disable the controller setting which made the keyboard and mouse work again.
---
In West Virginia? That’s pretty uncommon.
---
Pretty sure Wastelanders will have the entire region in a more snow-like appearance, as it was hinting through art of colder-looking equipment (like sweaters), and some critters are about ice cold variants (the Blue Floater).
---
To make 'snow', they'd have to go over more or less every outdoors texture in the game, a number of particle effects, a number of rocks, and so on. It ultimately isn't worth the amount of work it would take, particularly when some textures are used for multiple areas, some of those areas being interiors.
---
I get people want to see interesting things happen in game, but this sub has a hard time grounding its expectations.
---
I have never had more than 8k caps. Ever I can't sell anything except gunpowder fml...
---
PC farmer here. I have duplicates of rare plans. Let's get a discord going to trade these out so we optimize our returns.
---
Yes.  I blame Bethesda for making a moronic decision that is the equivalent of defaulting an XBox One or PS4 to using mouse and keyboard with zero controller ability until the mouse and keyboard setting is disabled.
---
Sorry, you can white knight this all you want but nothing about this decision that Bethesda made is good.
---
Bolstering at low health, vanagurd at full health. Both give +35 a piece. Sentinal is also super helpful
---
Okay I'll keep those in mind. Thank you!
---
Yeah I’m going to start collecting them next week. Until then I’ll keep opening them
---
I feel like my armor breaks all the time and my thirst/hunger depletes much faster since Patch 16. I am constantly repairing every 30-40m of intense combat and drinking/eating every 15m or so.
---
I think they are lv 55 not the weapons lv 55
---
I had a teammate that looted at least two boxes. I begged for a weapon for five minutes. No dice. I eventually found a grenade launcher and killed someone with it. Defining moment of my night.
---
Sorry friend but I'm on xbox. Would love to otherwise.
---
You wouldn't say the same if you were here before they fixed their attack rate.
---
Gould already hit to hard
---
Sounds more like he has a terrible connection to the server and some data transferred incorrectly. There aren’t “bloody servers” to my knowledge. Not that has been confirmed at least.
---
you know, you can just like, unplug it then turn controller in the settings off instead of coming to reddit to call bethesda morons even though you are one with the weird non traditional peripherals. this is an issue of operator error.
---
Its a 2 star lv. 50. Bloodied and explosive is all it is.
---
Can Confirm
---
Right lvl 55 toon.
---
I saw this today inside the Big Bend Tunnel and my VATs kept targeting them, it was quite annoying :(
---
How many caps?
---
You’ll get there man. Just keep grinding. 1400 a day to the vendors.
---
Yeah. Rare plans or what used to be rare lol. The infamous plasma grenade plan for one.
---
Y'all wasting your limited refunds on such cheap items. At least get your atoms worth.
---
We've wanted them to do that forever, it won't happen, we might as well get snow at this point
---
I run vanguard's. Previously full vanguard BOS but transitioning to Marine for some Rad resistance. 
---
I run a full health build. Never use PA unless I'm harvesting flux or lead ore. 
---
My only real defensive perk is blocker. Vanguards and blocker is pretty solid. Rarely find myself in trouble and if I do the VE comes out. Dying is very rare.
---
Rather them not break more stuff trying to half ass it
---
Message me on xbox if you're interested.  JS The Ragman
---
Have they figured out how to make their servers not crash yet? 
---
I see they've implemented pay-to-play with your friends, rather than just listing selectable servers that show how many players are active because that would be too much like most multiplayer games.
---
I remember the good old days when we paid money to play with random strangers and hanging with your friends was free.
---
Nope. 15 strength, 15 intel, 1 charisma. I am a strong, smart, unlikable asshole. I like it that way.
---
 It's there anything I should really keep any eye out for?
---
Sounds like a great addition to the game, which can add not only new gameplay mechanics, but allow for a fresh look on a pretty stagnant game world. Thats why it will never ever be added. Because Bethesda.
---
Nope, not even once since it came out last week lol I heard the chance is minimal like 2% or something :(
---
They already have rain shaders, I doubt something like a frost (maybe not a snow) shader would be doable- especially since we've seen it in modding with games like Skyrim and fo4.
---
Yes.  The servers do come down on their own, but a high traffic area will get picked clean pretty easily.  I’m guessing Glassed Cavern is on the top three list at the moment.
---
It’s an easy fix with a server hop.  It’s much more of a pain when you’re trying to farm a nuke you just launched.
---
I'm going to keep crafting and opening large gifts until I get all the rare plans.
---
Lmao
---
There is definitely some more mechanics then pure rng code. In a fresh private server I will never spend any script on armor because it's almost always light armor. When you travel to placese some of the first spawn are low lvl before the game recon your high lvl and spawn matches your lvl. I could go on. The code mechanic is not as simple as one would think. To often I get similar stuff in the same instance. Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, weightless, weightless, weightless, unyielding, unyielding, unyielding and so on. In the end it might all be rng lol.
---
Just let it go and accept they will never be fixed. Whole game is a giant bug.
---
Just sell you’re excess legendaries for 20-25c per scrip. After you max out your daily 1400 everything else is just extra caps. Meds seem to sell good like stims stealthboys and dog food.
---
In Chernobyl they say they winter is the safest time of year to visit because the snow acts as a radiation shield.
---
Hiroshima also still has snow. Really the entire world wouldn't be getting hit so these seem like realistic examples they won't waste expensive weapons backwoods just major cities and water and surviving creatures would carry it pretty far as well as the wind to do the rest
---
I put it in the tree roots, it's visible but I can't select it. I have one spot on some level 40 radtoads north of Berkeley on the junk node, it's a tree house. Usually there's only a few level 60s if I do get attacked. I don't have defenses and it's seldom an issue
---
What are people buying? I haven't been able to play in awhile.
---
It will be Lag City if they did
---
welcome to the beginning, what every they did, undid changes this is how it was at the beginning when white knight and 5 intelligence for you choice of weapon were needed.
---
Back In MY DAY we would use the mortars as an infinite stash
---
Thank you, I will look out for vanguard and marine.
---
I see what you did there
---
A ScorchBistro sounds amazing!  I love elaborate builds! Mine is just a cabin by the river. Nothing to crazy but its decorated to the max. Do you have any pictures up? Id love to see yours!
---
Living in the toxic valley makes it feel like it's snowing.
---
Become Jim Pickens.
---
Holiday gift wrapping to craft holiday gifts
---
Thank you kindly my fellow explorer.
---
I can’t wait to see us all in them. *coughs* Bethesda *cough*
---
It's been asked for, problem is, everyone's working on Wastelanders to take the time to make a winter version of Appalachia.
---
I hope they do this (for free)
---
I get a reduction on damage (+6% instead of +33%) taken from Empath with lvl 3 Class Freak
---
They weren't lurking when Fallout 1st came out lmao
---
I run Carnivore mutation, so anything that drops meat is food and I always have lots of water.
---
Or, you know, Bethesda could not make stupid ass decisions that require people to unplug their peripherals just to play the game.  There is nothing weird or "non-traditional" about the Tartarus.  This is an issue of Bethesda making stupid ass decisions.
---
Are you in main menu? I think you have to invite to team from main then drag them in that way. But I’m not a fallout 1st slave, so not 100% sure.
---
I live an hour away from it and we had snow early November
---
Yeah, they were really rare, been seeing more separate from the Holiday Scorched.
---

Moonshiners Shack near the Gunner's HQ in FO4, just as you get within sight of it . . . KA-BOOM !
---
When you finally explore the ruins, the reason becomes clear
---
per the release notes:
---
User Interface
---
    Private Worlds: Following community feedback, we have added a new button to Private Worlds mode on the Play Screen so that Private World owners have more choice in how friends can join their World.
---
        The button can be toggled between “Team Only” and “All Friends.”
---
        Team Only: When “Team Only” is enabled, only the Private World owner and players they have already formed a team with can enter the Private World.
---
        All Friends: Switching to “All Friends” will allow any players on the Private World owner’s friends list to enter the Private World.
---
there is no button, and the cake is a lie.
---
PC
---
That sounds like last night but..
---
All cargo bots that spawn on the map eventually fly there after dropping their load. I'm guessing they are supposed to de-spawn there, but for whatever reason, they do not.
---
I've followed several across the map after crippling at least one engine.
---
I had rare ish plans on sale for 10c each and nobody bought anything ever.
---
*IF YOU LOVE IT SO MUCH THEN WHY DONT YOU MARRY IT?*
---
Hmm yes, that is odd. Sorry I can’t help you more dude.
---
I'm having the same issue I don't want to redownload the whole fkin game again =(
---
MAYBE I WILL
---
??? they literally post hundreds of articles about things that arent fallout every day
---
Fuck yeah science
---
I would love this. Pastafarian all the way!
---
I had it happen a while back, I let it cycle and eventually it stopped (about 5 mins)
---
Maybe the punchline was the game we've playing all along my man...
---
Okay. I don't have FO1st and i'm on Xbox so i'm probably the most under/qualified person to be responding but it sounds to me like a Bethesda side issue based on your other comments. If the social menu is messing up and not letting you invite people, it's a Bethesda issue. Send in a ticket asap.
---
Suggesting option for boat build minus the water, like around the New Gad area, where most of the water is gone but there are still small bodies there. Used to build there a while back.
---
Whats a Kotaku?
---
I run uny sentinel. Uny gives me buffs to carry weight, vats and ap. Sentinel keeps me alive while sneaking around. Use barbarian in strength with uny to give dr. Iron clad in endurance for 50 dr and er. Serendipity to negate dmg if ur a low health build, nerd rage for more dr and ap, evasive in agility for dr and er.
---
Back in my day we drank straight from the water source with even meaning to or causally sit down while getting attacked or looting
---
Upgrade to Fallout First Premium for access to the winter servers.
---
Don't give them idea for the atom shop !
---
lmao imagine getting so upset at bethesda because you dont know how to troubleshoot
---
Ok Beta. I bet you’re gonna say the night was darker and a chance to get perfect preserved pie cost caps from vending machines
---
R'amen
---
They stay on the map to reduce lags. Same with the nuke zone. Far up north.
---
Honestly, don't. Unyielding really only gives you a boost in combat if you're a melee build. If you wanna run bloodied and PvP with relative success then you wanna go with Bolstering.
---
While I absolutely know they are, I'm not entirely sure if true bloodied (running at 75+% radiation/&lt;25% HP) builds have any use other than PvP at all anymore. I mean what good does your 986 damage in your handmade for PvP when you can no longer hit for higher than 110? Add in the fact that the damage delayed when looking at a bloodied weapon are pretty irrelevant with PvP and now you've willingly decided to contribute to dying and fast. But mutant adds +10 per piece and you're not radiated enough to benefit from bolstering but you're too radiated for vanguard  so you find a middle ground.
---
I was pissed when people started to realize it's nonsense for PvP; I'd literally just gotten an executioners handmade and E tesla.. but most all of the PvP players that used any bloodied/commando play style realized it was a stupid trade off and realized they could just put it in the middle. And it's honestly as if everyone forgot "mutant" armor existed, it's a totally ignored prefix by the vast majority of everyone.
---
If you're going bloodied commando, go for (hear me out here) Mutant Sentinel, and willingly keep yourself half health. Both bolstering and vanguard have their amazing added additional resistances but you have to stay in either extreme, which is either going to give you super low HP but +32 DR EE boost from the half health can put someone hitting consistently 110 and you now don't have to run the opposite direction of every rad shower and you've gained almost half your HP back. 
---
Junkies is pretty fun, but what everyone fails to mention is the required dexterity and muscle memory of what you take and when. The way people just hit 8 different things in their favorite wheel had be awe inspired at first. It's sorcery for them to have more than four items on favorite wheel and not struggle with "No, I wanted a quantum, and now I've hit a stealth boy. Let me try it again. Jesus now I'm just gonna be that person that is ALWAYS stealth, this wheel is unusable" 
---
Then you see a junkies POV and they are hitting their wheel methodically and in a pattern they've memorized. And I'm over here still trying to drink a quantum, eight MK3s later. I'm a huge fan for vanguard sentinel for junkies, and strangely enough, mutant sentinel for half health/bloodied  but people are so attached to that apparently magical "assassin" prefix
---
I remember trick or treating had to be rescheduled for snow on multiple occasions.
---
A green glowing snowman for camp! That would give you rads , equal to the decon shower taking them away. This would be awesome tactical ootion
---
Despite the negativity, the fun and adventure far exceed the issues...that’s why so many continue to play.   With the game at the price it is now...I personally think now is the best time for new players to jump in and get their feet wet and expose their mind to the Fallout Lore in preparation for Wastelander.  Go for it.
---
Use the tents. Easy to build, looks cool and realistic, and can be moved easily if you want. Flat ground can be tricky to find in some areas but you can do a quick little foundation if need be.
---
Completing “Mayor for a Day” is literally game-changing. Can walk around Watoga without being attacked by robots (unless you aggro them), and they will attack other enemies for you.
---
Regarding fallout specifically but in generally they focus on negatives a lot more than they use too. I use to like kotaku a lot.
---
No fucking way. Once you let one religion in—and it is a recognized religion—then we will have fucking sjw assholes wanting to have hijabs etc.
---
I thought the puns would get old... they do not. One might say Pastafarian
---
I've had at least one piece of armor break nearly every seasion since the patch and that never would happen before. I would normally be fine repairing when I got back to camp. I even put two points of white knight on cause it was annoying and I still broke armor.
---
I’m going to leave this comment. Just as I feel it could be misconstrued
---
That on its own is probably doable, but a full winter redo for the game would be a waste of development, especially considering what they are/were working on this month.
---
Oh I gotcha.
---
Gotta get those Mr. Fuzzy tokens somehow.
---
My friend and I tested it out and we figured out that’s where they all go after they’ve unloaded their cargo. To forever fly there until their inevitable death..
---
Because it's too easy to accidentally take instead of antibiotics and thus ruin your junkies build...
---
That’s a reasonable rate of return considering I pickup 1* scrip from player vending for up to 300 per.
---
Yes this times 100x I hate having to switch shit around when I dont want to wear my pa or bust out the shotty.
---
If power armor counts, Ultracite PA. Something about that suit just makes me feel like a chad.
---
The day I successfully kill someone in NW, will be the day I will have no choice but to declare I won fallout 76. And never play again. Because I will never achieve that twice. (I'm God awful with spatial awareness, I'm pretty sure I'm the only person who uses VATS to find something and then shoots it out of VATS. (Honestly what has started working for me is berry mentats, even if nobody is stealth it adds that pink glow to your otherwise "Why is this tree shooting me... that's not a tree" body.
---
So far I like the leather coat! I’m holding out for a Mr, Pebbles Costume!
---
Nice post.  Glad you're enjoying the game.  If you just started during the free weekend you have a lot left to discover and learn.
---
And I agree, while the NPCs drove the story in previous Fallouts it was tiring to click through the conversation tree.  I much prefer listening to a holotape while moving on.  And the world hardly feels lonely when there are many camps to check out, many other players - nice or nasty (hm....sounds like a cool shampoo name) - and a bunch of Fallout buddies on mikes to talk with and share adventures with.
---
Very kind of you.
---
Wait....I can build more than more Santatron at my camp?
---
BOS Heavy Combat Armor, Shielded BOS Fatigues, BOS Combat Helmet, Patrolman Sunglasses and Veil of Mystery. 
---
(Or is that too specific?)
---
I wish I had pics. I've been begging for help with them for months. I've got no eye when it comes to pictures.
---
Im looking forward to it I think its gonna be the icing on the cake for this game and I'm gonna play the soundtrack from NV and pretend my character  is the courier and has moved east and is older like a dark knight courier play through. Wasn't the checks for Ulysses in nv like 100? I'm just curious
---
There’s audio cues for the present dropping scorched? I play with the volume off and subtitles on.
---
Actually That’s just what my friend told me, I haven’t used it yet. So idk.
---
No one has access other than you, but the crafting system steals junk. If you put a bear in your stash box, and then craft something that requires cloth, it will most likely destroy the bear.
---
Pastor outfit with White Wolf Fedora. Sometimes sunglasses
---
Why is that a problem?
---
Yes Bethesda...add the Christmas captions!
---
Even a snow machine similar to our fog machines would be cool
---
I just want a Borderlands system where you pay the in game currency to respec (Not atoms I mean caps)
---
Different uniforms for different troops. 
---
BRIMSTONE Squad
---
T-60 - Elder Torso, Blackbird helmet and legs, Atom Cats arms.
---
DEMON Squad
---
X-01 - Blackbird helmet. T-60 - Elder Torso, Blackbird arms and legs. 
---
Armoured Ranger Coat, Raider Skull gas mask. 
---
Check out some styles here:
---
Doesn't it return the excess material like in fo4?
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
Do they have caption for the West Virginia Tales? I cannot find the option, please add caption for that too.
---
Wasnt there just a free weekend???
---
(Quick upvote for you, brother!)
---
Keep spending! I’ve seen many experiments that show many servers lean towards certain legendaries
---
Addictol? Try finding some Jet. I'm having serious withdrawals
---
i feel you, same happens with me
---
Spreading scorched is their way of living. And stay alive if our way of living. So yes, if they don’t die, then we die.
---
As a bloodied build, and I'm not suggesting you go that way, I rely on Serendipity for low health. On my full health build, I rely upon Dodgy. These help a lot more than you think they would, especially Serendipity.
---
If you have Agility to spare, Evasive is handy to have. Also, Born Survivor is an amazing perk. 
---
As for armor, I use a combination of Combat (BoS) &amp; Marine Armor. Scout Armor is ideal, but it can take time to find the right legendaries.
---
I wouldn't get too caught up in DR/ER numbers. Yes, you need some, but there are some amazing perks that can help out with that. I've got all the PA builds, and their only real benefit is Rad reduction when a regular armor player is set up right.
---
In game name is space doctor, so the clean space helmet and the vault tec lab coat.
---
We do not need this game to get woke or be a battle ground for people wanting their pet BS memorialized.
---
Welcome home, when you first start just try to stick to the story and level up, if you want to do a pistol build just keep an eye on your perk cards and get what applies, there is a list of perks on here somewhere. In my opinion you would be better off with automatic pistols you can keep your vault suit till endgame and could find some one to put the mods on it so it has some type of protection to it.
---
They don’t talk about the great holiday event that players are clearly enjoying, instead they focused on bugs and cheaters. Oh, medias. This is called selective reporting, reporting truth is about reporting the both sides. They are clearly watching the FO76 community, and yet they ignore the good things people are talking about.
---
If you use vats at all the agility buff helps with AP a lot.  Not sure if Dodgy works with PA, but it is kind of nice.
---
Loaded from Christmas event.
---
- Leather coat
---
- Green hood 
---
- Prisoner collar
---
- Plague doctor mask
---
- Keep out backpack
---
Lol I can agree with you on that.
---
So 3 one star cards cards give you +30%, but 1 3 star card is only 20%.
---
I love the pirate outfit and hat with my bloody shovel &lt;3 or the ritualistic clothes and mask for my deathclaw gauntlet
---
So your a border patrol officer?
---
My friend did earlier- he eventually just had to dashboard
---
I would agree that the constant yellow brown colors hurt my eyes especially in the Queen area lol
---
Heavy bos uny wwr armor with shielded bos under armor, and just recently got the armored ranger suit with the armored raider skull mask!
---
There’s a button on Xbox but I had someone on pc tell me there was no option
---
Thank you for all your input fellas. I decided to get it since the game is on sale for 20. Now if i can find this stupid redeem code that "was sent" to my email.
---
Armor durability isn't what I'm seeing, but that low level are having way more impact on HP.
---
Forest camo jumpsuit with patrolman glasses clean army helm and free states bandana and backpack atm.  
---
Except I got a damn trapper chest and it’s messing up the whole look!!
---
Other chars:
---
-Rotating Asylum outfits
---
-Cultist robes, the special hat and the tire backpack / clown outfit as secondary
---
-silver shroud ensemble, occasional pastor vestment with black prospector hat as secondary 
---
-scarlet sniper/secondary hunter long coat
---
So happy I picked up the black shovel backpack.  It goes with a lot of outfits.
---
For once playing on console has an advantage, non of the crap being introduced by the duping cheating scum that you get on pc. Don't get me wrong there's duping scum on xbox, but PC players have taken it to a whole new level.
---
You really think they will put that kind of effort into it? I mean the Xmas tree in the atom shop doesn't even have lights on it lol. No chance
---
Yes!
---
I’m playing the Chinese Version, I think all Asian version’s sorting system is just a total mess. I have no idea how they are sorted based on the name, it’s not like the alphabetical sorting in English version.
---
And it’s a pain in the ass
---
I hadn't seen any effects of this yet. Then last night I fast traveled to a train station and there were 3 Scorchbeast Queens flying overhead.
---
I mean... it does?
---
It's been proven in multiple studies that smoking being portrayed in media children consume leads to increased risk of smoking.
---
And drink... I saw the Nuka Cola drinking animation from Fallout 4 New Vegas Mod Preview. It’s so cool.
---
I wish I read this before purchasing the holiday lights in the atom shop 😫
---
Gotta sell those repair kits brah.
---
If they sell it in the current state. I won’t. At least I won’t till it’s actually Private Server instead of Private “Session” where I cannot make adjustments to the world and rules.
---
However I bought the membership. Simply because the 1650 atoms per months already exceed the value of the membership. 
---
Everything else is not worth it at least now.
---
Ask for a refund maybe
---
Nearly every other camp I see has fallout first. The scrap box, survival tent, and private world are the biggest draws but there's also some sweet cosmetics and monthly atoms.
---
I don’t think any of this will happen until next year.
---
It's also 12.99 per month if you decided to go that route but honestly nothing other than actually feeling like a lone wanderer. You get 1350 atoms a month which cool but I probably won't be renewing my membership honestly. Also a scrap box and I believe something else
---
I must have missed the thing about 1650 atoms with the subscription.
---
It's about $156 if you go per month.  $99 for the whole year.
---
It's been pretty worth it if you like playing with a small group, or like this Holiday Event, being able to visit places without fear of someone else having cleared the area before you.
---
Cool tip, thanks :)
---
That explains a lot... Biv' found a new job 👍
---
Dupers and griefers? Not familiar with those term?
---
why are you asking us if bethesda is going to say something? ask them, reddit doesn't know.
---
As if they're doing us a service.
---
Leave it to Kotaku to spin it like that.
---
Did you find the hidden sacrificial chamber?
---
In my day, we thought we had to take the pictures of the monsters while they were still alive....
---
Go away troll
---
Yep!
---
But I don’t have balloons :(
---
Don’t worry, they will probably add “winter snow” to the atomic shop for only 5,000 atoms.
---
Indeed. Unfortunately, me and controllers don't work very well together. Plus, there's way too much to loose on my account(s) to switch platforms now.
---
Who says I'm a troll, I'm genuinely curious. Damn so defensive already lmao no wonder everyone calls this sub r/StockhomSyndrome
---
Repair kits?
---
Speaking as a trader - the new exploits has a real chance to ruin the game for me and many others . This is really depressing and  has nothing to do with "being negative".  This need to be stopped.
---
  Also as someone who has been quite active in the Twitch F76 community  ( as a moderator and in chats)  -  i want to say that there are many great content creators - it is just that F76 simply doesnt attract many viewer.  
---
 One of my favorite channels is a trading channel doing price checks and auctions  . 
---
 Many of the things you talk about do exist  - it just isnt any of the " big" names  doing it  - rather f76 is a niche game right now.
---
Back in my day people sold their unused legendaries to vendor bots and I bought a lvl 35 TSE shotgun that could one-shot anything, me included.
---
Personally, I believe that you should let people do what they will. So what if people support this game? It's not hurting you as a person therefore you should not care why they support it.
---
LOL.  I went the opposite route and started shedding weight gradually as I tried to adapt to 76, having come straight off a playthrough of 4 before launch.  
---
At one point I was the anti-hoarder and carried 5 stims max.  Encryptid and triple SBQ got me back up to 20, but I’m still frugal.
---
I get your point, though.  I feel like a king with unlimited scrap and a couple extra guns in my stash, which I only use during the Meltdown raid.
---
I've been scripping 3 characters worth every day, but it is easy to transfer to an alt in a private world.
---
Bring on the next purveyor sale.
---
fuck off dude you get your information from youtubers. lmao what a joke.
---
people play the game because they like it, just like any other game. people dont play games to think about some company or shit like that. noone needs to justify thier choice of entertainment to you.
---
That's a never adopted feature from the Skyrim game jam.  They've got more FO4 stuff to put into the Atom shop.
---
loool
---
I'm not here saying fuck yall for doing it, I said I don't understand why despite everything Bethesda has done you guys continue to support it as if it hasn't been one of the most controversial video games to date. And now you're all being defensive and won't answer my questions directly
---
90% of your 3-day old account history is low effort shilling. Hop along.
---
Idk why but I think my level 32 character is taking less damage
---
No it does not
---
Not until people learn that it's not called script.
---
I think they could do it in spots like the ski resorts and other mountain top marked locations. Add some decorative lights on some buildings and all set.  The other areas need not be changed at all really.  WV doesn’t get that much snow other than the higher elevations anyway.
---
I've never smoked IRL, so it would be interesting to smoke in-game. No health risks included at least xD Bring it on!
---
Well it's simply because people enjoy the game. Sure the company isn't doing what's best for the consumer, but the game is still enjoyable and there is fun to be had. Most of your points are valid, however your aggressive approach may make people a bit defensive initially.
---
Wym?
---
Back in our day you could over repair vfast melee weapons and fucking wreck shit with a buzz blade. RIP Vampire handy blade 😢
---
Half of me is doing this because I am actually curious, and another to see how pissed people get when I insult their god Todd Howard, the unsinkable one
---
The game has issues, but is still fun. I've played about 1800 hours &amp; I still play everyday &amp; enjoy it.  Have fun :)
---
Back in my day we had to waste 50+ caps traveling around the map to visit all 7 factions to collect our daily caps, and TSE shotguns ruled the land.
---
God forbid someone insult Todd "The God" Howard. They in denial with buyers remorse
---
Yeah me too
---
I knew this is why it broke in last tuesdays patch, they were trying to stealth nerf armor degrades and some dummy moved a decimal or forgot something was a multiplier, but it revealed the true intention... To change it somehow, and not likely for the better. 
---
Expect reduced queen repair kit drops soon.
---
That's more doable, for sure. It's just that adding snow beyond 'white fog' would take a lot of work, especially if you consider what the OP was requesting.
---
The game is awesome.  I'd love to see what their second rendition would look like on next gen.
---
I find it impressive what they've done year one.  Ark, H1, ect all had huge issues.  I'm not sure what people expected with this one.
---
On a side note, I wish all mp survival world games would allow you to build a public market.
---
Buy it
---
Where was this cool pastor at my church! Lol
---
I don't remember what the bears are made of. But let's say they are 2 cloth and 2 leather. If the Bear is in the stash box and you craft something that requires 1 cloth. It will take the Bear from the stash, and put 1 cloth and 2 leather in your inventory.
---
When i use to buy ballistic fiber, I would have to remember to store all junk after fixing my armor, because when it broke down the bulked ballistic fibers it would put the rest on me, and I would loose it if I died.  😞
---
So it's definitely a good time to buy right now?
---
If your looking for just good ol fun of looting and fighting enemies and exploring the map, then yes 100% buy it! If you are looking for story and choices and stuff, then you'll have to wait for the Wastelanders update.
---
It's $20 and you really can't beat that, especially when they  are going to be adding free content to this game for years to come.
---
Do you think if I wait for the big update it will rise in price?
---
Thank you, much appreciated.
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
what the fuck do you want the people on this sub to tell you? if bethesda is going to make a statement about the current bugs and hacks?
---
Was: Stalker coat &amp; goggles with black cowboy hat
---
Now: Caravan coat with stalker goggles &amp; civil war top hat
---
Both with black miner back pack
---
Well for starters, double xp ended almost 10 hours ago
---
I have one of those and a noodle cup on display lol need a pirate outfit still :P
---
I've come back a couple times but only for 20 minutes or so. I really want to play, but I just can't get rid of all my scrap. My stash is full and I've over 1000lbs on me, *after* reductions. I always get an urge to come back but I can't experience the new content without fast travelling and there's no way I'm dropping all my stuff.
---
Shame really.
---
LOL dont tell me what words I can use you arent the boss of me.
---
It's probably on sale right now because of the holidays. If you were to buy it now, you can start playing now so you can level up, get some good gear to better prepare yourself for the Wastelanders update.
---
I imagine a lot of it will require being a high level and have at least decent gear. You'll also want junk materials in case Wastelanders offers anything in terms of crafting, which it almost certainly will.
---
That's hardly the main concern I'm facing..
---
With Wastelanders around the corner its a definite yes
---
I'm not on atm, but have a group of helpful players who should be able to. 
---
PM Sentinel Looch for enlistment details (Looch#7529).
---
Yes the exploits need to be brought to light faster. Snitches are needed. It’s a bad thing on all platforms but pc must have it rough. But cheaters need to be punished harder. Longer bans, stricter rules. They know what they do. They read the TOS, crack the whip and be hard boss. 
---
That’s the thing 76 “can” have a following. Everyone raves at NV being the best of the best. But I recall it had a lot of crashes and problems. And look now people bring it up like it’s the framework we need to follow going forward. 
---
That’s great that people are but without putting on pedestals. We need to get them out in the open. Make them known. Point people to them.
---
I got Fallout 1st simply for the atoms, survival tent, stash box and atomic shop exclusives. I never really had any interest in private worlds, without having control over the settings and mods, to me it's pointless.  
---
However with the Holiday Scorched event, Private Worlds have come in very hand as a way to farm Scorched because you don't have to worry about an area being cleared out.
---
You don’t wanna dump a lot of it on another character? That’s what I did until fallout 1st came out. Now I just collaborated all the mules stashbox into 1 scrapbox on my main character. It’s really convenient! :) 😃
---
That's a really good one. Even better than running the tunnel, honestly.
---
Lmao!
---
Cars show the damage also
---
Restart the launcher.
---
Snagged a junkies explosive handmade today so I was pretty stoked as well! Two days ago I got an aa explosive fixer! I haven’t gotten anything good in the last 3k scrip so maybe I was do
---
I love NY furious shovel ❤️
---
I can’t do white knight I value born survivor and action boy too much lol
---
Thinking of building a camp near one lol
---
They are more tied to area and creature spawn level than anything.  If you kill them in the Forest, you're basically going to find gear that's Lv. 10 or less.  In the Bog and Mire, you're more likely to find something Lv. 35-50.
---
I'm ready for Hanukkah Fog Crawlers, with sidelocks hanging from their head and a prayer shawl.
---
People who use exploits to duplicate items, and people who troll other users.
---
Let me know if you find a Bloodied Explosive Tommy gun! &gt;&lt;
---
Medical goggles are the best!
---
I used to have a commando build that I copied off of nukes and dragons Ill link it here for you to check out, you can always change it to your liking depending on weight reduction perks and whether you want to be a stealth build and do more damage. If you dont already have it get the mutation adrenal reaction. You want to try and keep your health low enough for nerd rage to kick on but enough buffer in case you get hit. Im not a commando build anymore (melee now) but can get my BE handmade to 280 a shot. Bet yours will be crazy with all those perks.
---
[Bloodied Commando Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f145bf&amp;d=sb2s01p02pd0pk0pl0pp2eu0c71ic4an2ar2ao0a30a02lv2lt2l71l10cr0pi0ph0pg0li2lu2po2&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=Bloodied%20Commando)
---
I wasn't aware that was a thing! Some people have too much time on their hands.
---
I only play malee and will break 2-3 pieces so frequently i am now just farmig for scews basically.
---
Toothy man mask and golf outfit or pioneer scoutfit w shorts hehehe

---
That or something similar should get you where you want to go.
---
Do we know if the gifts will still be usable/able to open after the event?
---
That's a fair point.
---
This worked.... all is well.  Will update OP
---
I finally started transferring the rifles I had been hoarding to an alt that'll eventually be built for them, but def need to make a another one for general storage. Trusting Bethesda to not wreck your private instance after dropping legendaries you actually like into a train station suitcase is nerve wracking to say the least, but I do like being able to move.
---
You just throw on Fix it good when your at the bench then take that sucker off. I’ve just recently been using it again because the repair kits are making my game freeze when used! Annoying af!
---
I would say at the rate the armor is breaking. A player with level 50 armor playing in high level areas MAYBE would get 2 hours of steady gameplay with one basic repair kit per armor piece
---
Just build a massive base, put that scrap to use
---
I think Rust has one now, too. Someone made a mod for it but I think theres legit in game now  
---
But their economy and items to sell aren't as impactful as Fallout.
---
240,000 for my plasma grenade  plan I was willing to pay 100,000 for! #somehowstillworthit
---
Heck, I'm considering buying it digitally and I even own the disc but am tired of switching xboxes.
---
Yes.
---
Yeah, same but I love the box art of games so I usually get the physical version.
---
There's more than 100 hours of content really. I'm level 144 and haven't discovered half the map yet.
---
Store the notes and holotapes you already read/listened to in your stash. That’s what I do. Easier to locate the ones you just picked up.
---
Longshoreman with a fishing hat. That's my default since I found that responder bot and knew it was special... Seen it two times before and thought nothing of it. Took over a month once I knew I had to see it again!
---
Many Shuvs and Zuuls were roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you!
---
That sounds awesome.
---
I got two stalkers .44 in a row yesterday... Stopped spending immediately lol
---
yes  large gifts can reward scrip
---
I never said anything negative lol. I just said I missed the community part of events.
---
Really need to go read that again, all I said was I missed people together doing the events. Never said it was bad or anything negative.
---
Thank you both! I looked though your builds and made one that fits my play style, appreciate your time!
---
It's nice at least for repair cost reduction, I keep it up on all my chars but bloodied guy
---
Drifters outfit with the hunters hood.
---
Yeah I use it alongside fix it good for repairs I just don’t use it out in the world.
---
It's a code/programmer mistake, but I never felt it was a problem. My bloodied unyielding ninja always has enough food and water. And I eat and drink for those benefits, so... No big deal.
---
Never said you said anything negative. I just think that most fallout players are polarized on what they want
---
Let’s just be brutally honest here— big named people are not playing this game because nobody wants to watch somebody play it. It is just a buggy unfun mess right now. 
---
If they want exposure they need to improve their game.
---
Is it worth making the gifts?
---
I've been farming the scorched since it started.
---
I have about 6k caps and the perk to make double.
---
Do the crafted ones give better stuff or is it the same as if I find a large gift just quicker to get?
---
Easiest way to explain it, Don’t think of the c.a.m.p as a ring but a bubble. If you want to build high place your c.a.m.p high. My buddy built a 15 story camp I think before(maybe 10 I can’t exactly remember). You can either start from the ground build stairs to get higher then replace it higher or use a PA jet pack to get somewhere tall.
---
I have my tent set up like south east of there too. Right in between a mini fissure and a random spawn point.  Got 3 scribe outfits today.
---
Winter jacket and jeans or hooded rags, today. Tomorrow, we shall see... 
---
The only one I always go back to is the green hood + explorer outfit + backpack. Really immersive.
---
Yeah, right after they introduce the "value" bundle of repair kits in the Atomic Shop. Odd timing, isn't it?
---
Yeah, right after the update were they introduce the "value" bundle of repair kits in the Atomic Shop. Gee, I wonder what happened :\\
---
I’m over 1k hours in and still play almost every day. If you like exploring and building you will like it :)
---
For the gifts no, but the legendarys that come with them yes.
---
Interestingly seems going to a low area and farm for a bit would be an amazing way to get low lvl weapons for a new toon. I've got a few 2 and 3 star low lvl items.
---
Maybe farm the airport for a bit with your main and see if you get some good stuff to help the next toon.
---
"" air quotes is right, I'd rather by something that is semi worth it
---
First, Bethesda were on the brink of being sued, and loot boxes are literally in the game files but aren’t implemented as of yet, this isn’t criticism sure, because it’s  j o u r n a l i s m, and please tell me these circle jerks he was in and the “multiple” occasions where he had to apologise for being “flat out wrong”, and I want to see at least 5+ videos of him just apologising, not just tiny segments of videos, but whole videos of him discussing the topics where he had to apologise, and he has explained before why he has the 48 hour videos, because they’re not in the same video style to his others, therefore he can delete them since they’re not in the same category to his channels other vids
---
There have been far more other games that are buggy and messed up before 76. 
---
Exposure be it negative and positive is needed. The negative needs light just as positive.
---
You can get up to 100 scrip from one. I have not been this lucky yet but I did get 500 caps once.
---
Once at least. I think that may have been the case both times, but I don’t remember.
---
Yup. Vintage nukashine will do that. Makes an old school videogame noise, changes screen colors then after a few minutes you black out and wake up in a random place on the map.
---
I agree. Too dark and plagued by awful spongy mirelurk hunters and friends.
---
It’s definitely worse for me on Xbox. I figured it was all the legendaries I’ve begun to hoard
---
Everything seems ok for me.  Weapon and armor durability seem normal once the hotfix rolled back the 250dr bug.
---
As a sniper I don’t get hit a lot, but every so often I get spotted.  Since I run bloody with typically less than 15% health, I think I’d definitely notice a spike in incoming damage.
---
I’ve been spending an awful lot of time at fissure sites lately, and I’ve found that as scorchbeasts crawl out of fissures, they seem to gain the same omniscience that mole rats and radscorpions get versus stealthed players.  If you’re already in caution and fighting as they emerge, you immediately go into danger.  A full suit of uny/sneak armor, a fixer and 37-40 agility doesn’t matter.  Spotted immediately.
---
seeing as you’re late to the party...
---
make sure to equip Chemist (INT) so you get x2 gifts instead of 1!!
---
My friend made a ripper during that bug and it was a cursed object. Chucked it into a nuked fissure and nuked it again for good measure.
---
I’m on Xbox and my stash is always laggy
---
Try checking the map. Sometimes the SB gets “lost”. At least for me. Noticed this during line the Sind, surface to air and a few other SB related events.
---
We sacrificed the young blood for the Pie but the Pie was never sated. It was a blessed thing that lay untouched by mortals.
---
I'm sorry I should have specified. I am on xbox as well. Happy to hear I'm not losing my mind!
---
Regular mole rats can chew through concrete so why not mutated giant mole rats?
---
Only one for your CAMP - but you can also place one in every Workshop that you claim.
---
Divert devs from working on main game bugs to work on Nuclear Winter. Divert Devs from Nuclear Winter to work on Wastelanders. Game still plagued with bugs, NW filled with hackers, forums filled with requests that will never happen, and the number one fan request got released as a paid product. Hey I love 76 but damn I really hate Bethesda lately.
---
It's worth it for people who regularly buy atoms, because it comes with 1650 atoms per month.  The other things are just a bonus.  Most of my friends have 1st.
---
Join as many events as you can. Most are really easy and just surviving them will give you neat if not needed stuff. Especially, if you are low level. Walk everywhere that you can ( instead of fast traveling ) and just take in the scenery. Each region has its own flavor. You don't need to follow the questlines but I highly recommend that you do the one that gets you the Excavator power armor.
---
SSD will make load times nonexistent. It's beautiful.
---
Side note: Seasonal events need to start earlier
---
It's on sale cause it has more bugs than features. Fo4 is cheap and runs signifigantly better. Also it has mods
---
Most of the time its happening several seconds after i fast traveled.
---
LoL i actually found that out on accident too. Im a wanna pharmacist and pretty much alway have that card on unless im fighting the queen.
---
True, but the multiplayer aspect is compelling.
---
Scabber Outfit with the Sack Hood. (Still can't believe how rare that sack is) It's been my Raider getup since the bundle dropped.
---
If you are in a team only session you have to make a team through the Social Menu in the main lobby before you start the server. If anyone crashes then you have to quit out and reinvite to the team in the main menu.
---
Welcome to the wasteland!!👍👍
---
What is polished up from fo4?
---
this doesn’t work for me but i see this advice from time to time.
---
anyone have any ideas?
---
I cleared out that huge Grafton power plant last night just to claim the workshop. Trying to get enough steel to make ammo to last a day or two. 
---
Just as soon as I built a fusion generator a dozen rats destroyed it, twice. Then server disconnect, had to do all that work again, but this time I was ready for the bastards.
---
Also note that power armor adds a flat damage reduction per piece before even DR is in play. You can have armor be equal in value to power armor but not in terms of total damage reduction.
---
Console Master Race.
---
"Do you know how bad that is for you?!" he said, waist deep in radioactive sewage with med-x track marks.
---
Anything and my monster mask
---
The game freezes up like a the Nintendo wii’s disc drive playing sky landers, a scratched DVD, and my Dad’s stalled car which was in worse condition than Fred flinstone’s car combined
---
The moment of the player is one
---
I’m on Xbox too and it does that all the time also when I’m selling to the robot vendor or using the legendary exchange it definitely gets annoying lmao
---
I don't know exactly what ur going for but it looks like u could also use demo expert in intelligence. Also maybe class freak if ur running a few mutations and action boy for the ap refresh. I might take some out of perception for endurance and put on revenant with mysterious savior under luck for dmg bonus. Just my thoughts.
---
A simple fix that requires resources.
---
What would you prefer, the resources put to fixing a minor inconvenience or resources put to fixing the gamebreaking shit? Because those are your choices.
---
I’m on PS4 and it’s slow as shit right now and 4 disconnects per day. 
---
Lots more people playing since these Santa legendaries came out.  I guess that’s what it is.
---
Disc wouldn't matter. The loading tho is amazing. It's even faster on private servers.
---
Wavy Willard’s is one shot killing and up to 5 Santa’s each time. 
---
Low level weapons though.
---
Buy the ticket, take the ride. If you played other FO games I can’t believe you don’t own this yet. Don’t listen to the YouTube haters. This shit is fun.
---
And after that we only got what? Like one absolutely bland black skin and one semi-decent gilded one? I mean, I LOVE all the glittery and shiny stuff but even I passed on that one despite having 3k atoms by that moment.
---
100% this! Accessibility should be a default for every single game. The fact that it's not already is pretty disappointing actually...
---
Yes, how wonderfully they fixed so many gamebreaking shit in patch 16.
---
The modders pointed out ages ago: it's literally a matter of adding a "-" in the code. But sure, fixing the color of the scrapbox and a bush in Flatwoods are WAY more important, I'm sure.
---
I'm not on his side but anyone who uses the word "shill" is a troll who doesn't even believe their own rhetoric.
---
I do
---
Hw called you a "shill" that should tell you that you aren't going to have a legitimate conversation.
---
Ok, sounds like everyone in this discussion (except for a few) think I should get it so I think I will.
---
guess what, those who mess with art assets and those who mess with code are completely different people.
---
Pete the painter aint going to fix the code, just like Craig the coder aint going to fix textures.
---
This is the build I run. Bloodied vats commando build. My main weapons are BE Handmadefor most enemies, and B33/25 Combat Rifle for boss type enemies. (Uses barely any ap points in vats, great for critical hits.). I have a full 5 piece set of Unyielding armor with a mix of poison resist, ap regen and weight reduction.

Logged in yesterday after a long break, got 3 disconnects within 15 mins, yup, looks like this game does not want people to return.
---
Turned of 76 and play other dozens of games that at least don't have fundamental issues like unstable connections.
---
I want more contenta creator like Rifle Gaming.
---
The white ones seem to be common, dirty, weathered or clean.
---
From my expierience -
---
Green and brown are more frequent than other coloured ones,
---
blue, yellow even pink are rare but spawn at least once/twice a week. Had only once luck to find a forest one. The red is for me like plasma grenade plans.
---
But congrats to you for multiple Sets, even in red.
---
Its a real love hate relationship. Its both the best and worst game at the same time. Just wait till you are just about to pick up that legendary item you have looked for your whole life, and the game crashes. I can't stop though, so I know what you mean.
---
Are you using Blocker and Glow Sight perks?  I agree Ghouls and Scorched are doing more damage recently.  Even my XO 1 PA takes a pounding.
---
I am assuming you don't have a lot of experience with programming.
---
He’s good. A great baseline of a CC. There are areas to work on but he’s got a good footing. Nuke experiments? Fantastic. The community towns. Spot on. In fact that might his best theme.
---
I kinda like coming home to a bunch of random mounted wendigos.....
---
Then you can turn the toggle on 😇
---
You want to download 50GB of textures with shitty snow overlays? because thats exactly what it would be. 
---
The engine is not capable of dynamic seasons, at least in its current form. They wanted to do it all the way back in Skyrim but had no chance of making it happen.
---
Curious as to why you need auto and non-auto rifle perks on at the same time. The gun can only be one or the other, and you can swap them???
---
Nice build!
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
Tomorrow
---
There's a ton of people making content for the game and enjoy it. I feel like it's less about needing more people to make content and instead we need more people to support current content creators.
---
Thanks for the advice, will add demo for sure.
---
That comes with more people. But they need a better outlet to get more support. Better publicity is highly needed. 
---
Also happy cake day.
---
Same here
---
PC, and 20K at the moment. (Santa Crash and Icicle Lights are 10K just now.)
---
.
---
That's the highest I've ever set anything, so I feel kinda guilty. :(
---
If you already own the game then you have literally nothing to lose by playing it again. Only you can make the decision.
---
Yes. I just thought I was more spongy than I thought because I sneak normally and recently I've been more just blasting.
---
I wanna fuck your honey hole cunt cunt
---
you mean the hunting rifle vs the LMG vs a 10mm smg? because they're not exactly the same class, you know.
---
However, I don't know any of the added content or how much it contributes to the longevity of the games current state.  Which is why I would like to receive opinions from current players.  I didn't want to have to reinstall, and spend hours playing only to realize nothing major has changed.
---
I was just in your shoes. I bought it on sale two weeks ago and am having a blast. I'm already around lvl 50. Sure, there's some glitchy shit and some things I think should be fixed, but the good definitely outweighs the bad. I've easily gotten my money's worth and I plan on being around for the long haul. It's definitely worth checking out.
---
Meh.  Wheres my Krampus whip?
---
I don’t know that that was a glitch or just a mechanic. And it worked for armor as well. It was awesome until it was conveniently removed right about exactly when Repair Kits hit the atomic shop.
---
Right, I used to love scavenging thru dropped bags full of literally dozens of legendary items. They used to litter the grounds around the Golf Club after every nuke.
---
Whitesprings barely sees a nuke these days. Sucks really
---
I swear every time I set a workshop and enter WesTec, it freezes up on me. It's even done it on private servers. I don't waste my time any more
---
I did this event on a private server and we saw none.
---
I found a better price and got it for $10 on Amazon.
---
No free santa hats?
---
They both can be broken down at any crafting table my man
---
Ok Beta Boomer
---
Nah I'd wait for wastelanders
---
No
---
Living in Texas this post is my constant mood.
---
They weren't free last year.
---
10mm is easier to keep fed but the Lmg has better dps and range but a pain to keep ammo. Smg can be had cheaper too in similar legendary setups. SMG is a good pve where Lmg is a good pvp on top of pve if you can keep the ammo.
---
And this makes it OK how?
---
Wow his question flew right over your head
---
Too bad it only ever rains or freezes the rain in point.
---
Or my joke flew right over my head my man
---
Because we aren't OWED free santa hats? Lol.
---
No Christmas outfit with the event. No eggnog recipe. Only 2 camp items. Pretty sad effort.
---
I know my smart man I wouldn't add them too, everyone feels the same way thats why I added that last bit to make sure everyone understands its a joke because tags like that don't exist anymore (especially not with ToddFellas) as its damn universally accepted they are lame, thus creating an extra layer of irony, which when combined with my naive but heinously crafted response to his question, including some top notch puns might I add, creates an amazing joke. 
---
Do you need further explanation about that joke or can we move on?
---
So what is the best gift people hav given to themselves and how much did it cost you.. lol
---
They did already give us a free robot Santa
---
Found another minor bug that is related to reloading any gun. The responsers has mark which gives you -2 perception ends up giving you -4 when you reload.
---
Yeah it was cool, but I feel like more useful cosmetic items are on their way just coz of that gesture  - around Todd never fold.
---
Note: this after off fix to roll back the 250 damage resist bug.
---
I spent half a million on gifts
---
Stealth melee is great when it works, I find first hit doesn't register fast enough or at all sometimes and can make it a pain. But get escape artist and get your hit off and re position and crouch to get caution status. rinse and repeat
---
Spent half a mil myself
---
Yeah this exactly. Ever since Patch 16 I have to repair a couple pieces of armor every play session. Completely out of the norm for me. 
---
Been playing since the B.E.T.A. and it wouldn’t be the first time they snuck a change in without saying anything. Really crappy to have regular armor be as tissue thin as Power Armor was in Fallout 4. It’s just not fun to constantly have it breaking.
---
Lmg is an actual monster! Only gets better with perks. Down side is you pretty much have to prime it to be able to keep up with ammo. So more of endgame beast used for serious business.
---
I can’t see too many legendaries as a problem.. I do t necessarily disagree in principal but for months I feel like I’ve watched the legendary spawns decrease dramatically..
---
Back in the old days (lol) there would be bags and bags full of legendaries littering the grounds around Whitesprings after every nuke.
---
New fangled scrip nonsense
---
I just wish it had a higher chance if finding gifts.
---
Love to see imaginative builds.  Awesome.
---
I feel like people giving away their low level legendarys are your Santa’s minions and your the mvp Santa lol I will probably stop in sometime this week by the way
---
Some of the plans you can get have level requirements. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G_G5qKE/htmlview?sle=true#gid=0
---
The map is worth exploring and is online dynamic, turn your brain off to bugs/crashes (Don't get too worked up about loosing weapons or caps on accident) You'lk have a good time if you are not serious about it.
---
 Nice finish lol
---
I see what you did there.. and I like it
---
How is this not a thing already?  It's a conspiracy.
---
I’m waiting for wastelanders and reviews to come out before reinstalling.
---
Santa hat would be cool but I want the scorched Santa outfit

Bethesda at their work [https://www.tiktok.com/@brendanxa/video/6768950551213264134](https://www.tiktok.com/@brendanxa/video/6768950551213264134)
---
All my armor pieces are different types.  The combat armor breaks the fastest.
---
Your doing saintly work Mr Kringle!
---
At first I got a long answer containing the tutorial that is also available from the Fallout 76 News. This was after 1 hour. 
---
I replied and explained what I had done and that it is still not working. I also attached some screenshots from twitch and the linked accounts page for proof.
---
The next day, I got a reply that the package was added to my Fallout 76 account.
---
I logged in and each piece of the package was visible in the Atom shop - flagged as "owned"
---
I would then consider teaming with people.
---
Watoga
---
I’m not a pvp player.  So I’m leaning towards the smg, But I also have no trouble farming ammo. So I’m still torn
---
I've been waiting on these as well.
---
Yeah am still not done probably sell the legacy stuff I collected for more caps
---
I run a business where I mod for people...teaming with them is a courtesy so they can FT
---
Wait a minute.. this WAS in the patch notes I'm sure.  they said there was some bug that had stopped armour taking damage during combat and they fixed it.  So it's not that they've increased the rate it degrades, it's that it now takes as much damage as it's meant to.  *supposedly...*
---
Yup 200% durability is awesome.
---
Well shit.  Havent logged in yet today. Ill check it out.  (Ps4)
---
That sounds like my kind of multiplayer game.
---
I must’ve gotten on a bad server this past weekend because I went to the majority of all those locations without luck. I should’ve tried server hopping.
---
Outstanding
---
I dunno man.  This shit is fun and hilarious.
---
If you’re on Xbox I can build some at your camp for you
---
dang really? yea thats definitely a bad server lol. also you can get holiday wrapping paper of different qualities at any train station or faction vendor.
---
PvP is all or nothing. You have it you’re good otherwise don’t bother. In pVEna good stealth bloodied commando build can slay with a decent bloodied unarmed weapon too.
---
Thanks - I didn’t know this - but explains why PA still seems so much more tanks to me even though it doesn’t have that much more DR/ER than my regular armor ...
---
Sneaky stealth bloodied rifeman here and I would say to have the melee as a backup. I recently got a bloodied swing speed miner gauntlet and it’s a game changer. I’m now currently a sneaky stealth bloodied rifeman/unarmed. Having that option to switch weapons and gameplay is pretty cool and makes the game more interesting. Plus when I’m fighting a scorchbeast and it lands on the ground I hop like a little fat boy loves cake towards it with my unarmed and in three slashes or less it’s dead.
---
So I made my own kind of build on that website but I’m not sure how to save it for later...
---
You're giving the programmer's too much credit. They can't handle much more basic things, like not breaking the character select option for instance.
---
speaking of hearing impairment, I've always wondered how Bethesda deals with it in their games, like are subtitles enough?
---
Well...okay.  You came in with a chip on your shoulder and found reasons why it should be there.  Like all mmos, raids are hard, tedious, repetitive and difficult
---
It costs 450ish caps for a large gift with Chemist and level 3 Super Duper up.
---
Huh. Seems like you might have had better luck with a team. Did anyone anywhere at any time mention publically that this might be considered a team raid? I swear I read that somewhere..
---
If you are on PS4 (I can't tell because you failed to identify yourself) add me to your list of friends you don't know (Gheist009) and let's try this as a team!
---
Frankly, yeah, it's a long drawn out grindy raid but the strangler PA is kinda crazy OP.  If it didn't have reduced XP I really think most of the negatives would be offset.
---
Melee and rifles get along like a house on fire. The perks you need to make them shine are all in the PER 'tree' which you probably have like 3-6 points invested in.
---
Shotguns use to be my backup weapon of choice and from a utility standpoint they still work - with enforcer you can easily cripple SBs' wings and make them land, MQs's spouts so they stop dribbling all over you etc - but after many many... hmmm... 'rebalances' the damage is just not great.
---
Still, if you want to remain stealthy they can use a suppressor but if you want to see any real damage be ready to be pretty much in melee range. 
---
Personally I prefer heavy weapons these days. You forfeit stealth (and stabilised if you are not in your tin can however you can use a range of regular armours and VATS without needing to be tethered to a power plant like a fucking Evangelion so is not a bad tradeoff) but the damage output is good and Gatlings for instance are 'cheap to run'.
---
The crafted gifts are the same as the gifts you find. You mentioned having Chemist, but make sure you have level 3 Super Duper up to for a 30% chance for a third free gift per craft!
---
My armor doesn't break more often, but I'm taking WAY more damage than I used to. My rifle character now dies in 3 hits from a level 62 charred feral. It's BS.
---
They’re both a blast. If you haven’t already, buy both.
---
If I were you I’d do a modified bloodied.  It’s the most versatile build I’ve ever used.  Focus on range with backup melee (when you get bored, run out of bullets or when you’re getting overrun).
---
Some people go all in bloody builds and they can be quite squishy....I run a modified bloodied build on my farming char....I only have 2 melee specific perk cards and I can take out every monster in the game (not sure if I can still do SBQ solo though...I’ve heard her armor has changed past few months) with relative ease and rarely ever die.
---
Incisor and Martial Artist is all you need and the rest you can focus on typical bloodied builds for ranged stealth/commando (with slightly more focus on tankiness since more damage is just overkill most of the time).  I use bloodied range weapons but vampire melee.  Key is to use a fast attack melee (I use a Vampire SS Bowie knife).  The fast attack allows me to heal faster than I lose health.  When you couple either PA, bolstering or unyielding with nerd rage, serendipity and blocker...you’re essentially a tanky bloody build.  You’re damage comes from the Adrenal Reaction Serum and keeping health around 20-30%.
---
I wish these time limited reward tracks involved anything else that wasn't Nuclear Winter, because the amount of blatant cheaters I've encountered during it is wholly discouraging for me.
---
The most notable one was where this guy was running around the lobby with a "corrupt" character model (it looked like the textures were blackened and the model was crushed into a skeletal shape, I don't know how else to describe it), and had an extremely loud, overlapping sound coming from him that sounded like the knife weapon swinging repeatedly.
---
The match started, and several seconds later, all 30\~ people in the match were killed by him with that same, loud overlapping knife sound blaring, and the match just ended with his team of 4 as the victors. I ended up just saying fuck it, I'll get the event items next year if it's the same reward track and there's some form of anti-cheat implemented. Like goddamn, they have to know this is a big problem, right?
---
I already play 4 and its dlcs, they were pretty fun
---
Yeah there is.
---
the main issue with the raid is that due to server lag, you can fail the raid by running out of time. its out of your control and kinda defeats the purpose of a challenge if you can fail for reasons other than your own merits.
---
I play on a PC
---
Just reach down into Santa's sack
---
wow, i was just going to add that i now also have the exact same bug you describe, crash on purveyor buy.
---
i seem to be collecting bugs now. found several non-legendary santascorched...
---
Looks great! I wish that red fireplace would come back to the atomic shop, I've been wanting to put one in my camp but haven't seen it available lately.
---
You’ll miss the NPCs (until Wastelanders) but honestly the combat has been tightened up. I find the vats better, although crits are worse
---
couldn’t agree more
---
Same shit, to be honest. The game was patched so many times since the launch, that little to nothing useful was left from what's on the disc, so the game is already running directly from the HDD just like it would if you had the digital version, that's why when you installed, you probably saw it copying just 500mb or so from the disc, and downloading more than 70 gigs from the internet.
---
Youd have to share it, or copy the link and keep it in your memos or send a text to someone. It will save it as long as you keep that link. If you'd like to save it to a website you can creat an account on falloutbuilds.com and you can save it on there for people to use. Nukes and dragons is great to test out builds and see what level you will need to gain all those cards, what damage output youll have, and youre resistance. Its more like a planner to test out different perks. But Im glad you found one you like so far!

Yeah I heard that's pretty much the one issue with the game that really turns players away.
---
This is my hoarder build with 5 unyielding and lever action rifle. I switch to commando handmade for the queen. The biggest advantage is .45 is abundant so I haven't made ammo in months.

Playing 76 drunk or high is my favorite hobby 😂 I just love fallout and having a few beers and getting back into the wasteland is a great stress reliever lol
---
Raider Vendor bots.
---
I would say x2 faster.
---
I'm stuck on this one too, so I'll gladly help out!
---
I run a commando stealth build, full health AA. I don't have a secondary weapon, things like ghouls for example can brush last me and not notice. You have to be careful with all builds, as effects can get broken and glitch. Like using to many h2d pieces with the sneak perk, I use no h2d and rank 3 sneak with escape artist and I go unnoticed everywhere and can easily escape being seen within seconds. What I mean for a better example, with messing up effects is that I have an AA5025 Handmade, having tank killer plays with the AA effect so I don't use it, having better crits perks messes with the +50% crit damage on my handmade, its weird and hard to understand but legendary effects are there so you don't need to waste perks on, that what people don't get still. If you have the perk on a piece or armor or weapon then you don't need it on your perk cards if that makes sense...
---
So...it was too hard for you? You cant do Meltdown solo. If you can, you're a badass and I want proof. 
---
The other 2 raids you can solo. But overall the vault raid is a team raid. These raids are not about xp. These raids are about the end rewards. 
---
I do these vault raids daily. They are exciting and the only challenge this game has left for me. 
---
My advise to you: Find yourself a team. If you're on ps4 I'd gladly drag you through a vault...as long as you can keep up that is
---
I actually got the robot arms plan in a gift today. Quite a surprise. Now I just need robot chest and I can actually do the Roboticist challenge.
---
Should've been a tree that upgraded with each level (more foliage, baubles, lights). And actually interesting ugly Christmas sweater outfit with lights or giant reindeer costume (like the black bear)
---
Sometimes I just had to leave because infite load time (2 mins waiting in the vendor screen and wasn't empty, vendor mark shows plenty of items)
---
We aren't going to get a single gift from him xDDD
---
Happened to me 2 out of 3 times today
---
They’re too busy breaking the game further
---
Yeah it's ridiculous I've went back to ignoring it and getting in power armor instead don't understand why it breaks so fast its just armor
---
I'm a firm believer that some things shouldn't be rereleased because it shows you're OG but...I want these tile floors too!
---
Atomic shop didnt concern me then as it does in my end game play. But damn did I miss out on some cool stuff
---
not on the ps4.
---
pc or xbox?
---
On man. Poor you.
---
Indeed, I also saw the pic but with all the effects and only 3 stars above the weapon, its in the Juicehead's video on the subject if you want to see it by yourself.
---
My man, I probably wouldn't enjoy your friendship in real life, these might be the stupidest questions I've ever seen in this sub and that's saying something.......

Who the fuck says "official currency of United States of America since 1792's Coinage Act) ("Dollars") 😂

Secondly if you really needed to ask a reddit group of people whether to get the game then 9 times out of we're gonna say yes. Its almost like you're trying to flex like

I will if they ever release a wall-mounted one. There is a dartboard for entertainment though...

Gotta call it like I see it bud lol. If you want to keep it a buck then you gotta keep it a buck. Cringe comes in all forms including the official currency of United States of America since 1792's Coinage Act) ("Dollars") 😂

Thanks, I'm sure it'll come back sooner or later.

Bear in mind if you've got over 1700lbs carry weight, the items get destroyed if you try to drop them,

This all thread including that overdetailed dollar description is a joke, some smarter lads got it, (see where's the punchline comment) some didn't - like you 🌝 don't you have cringy posts to edit then delete altogether friendo?

Could you get fallout 1st for a month then put it all in the scrap box?, then if you need to revisit it again   pay for another month later down the line?

Maybe they'll scrap this whole slap-pvp mechanic including workshops and implement proper zones? Should be easy enough
---
Que?
---
Try buying something off of market76 and add this request as a part of the deal in a tongue in cheek way,  works most the time

If I'm not at a workshop or even claimed one then I shouldn't be killed at all when the other person has God mode cheat on

Yea I was modding my strangler heart and it said I had it too on pc but it was still grayed out
---
Oh yeh, XB.
---
That awesome finally something for the raider power armor.
---
Sorry man, I forgot to put the platform on. XB....
---
Yeh thats the exact reason I'm doing it, its shocking what people ask for in trades sometimes, the greed has gotten worse over time. I doubt it will change but then atleast I save someone from giving up everything for one. It's a great weapon and I've slayed a many of everything with it but after figuring a few things out recently I've gone to AA and now it's gathering dust.
---
I have a zealots ffr lmg that I primed and it is freakin unbelievable...... my furious ffr 10 smg not so much.
---
Festivus pole??
---
just letting you know I got more than fertilizer and coal as you stated.  If you get scrap already then why place the santa?
---
 I’d rather they focused their efforts on more important things. But it would be a nice quality of life feature.
---
I'd look for someone between say lvl 45 and 55 who just happens to be low health. Initiate trade to make sure they're not just an alt ( usually dead give away they'll have 10 or more different guns they've found, maybe a 1 or 2 star, pieced together armor, wood shack for a camp etc. lol). Drop gun with 100 rounds they'll get the idea!
---
As someone who doesn't have them, don't make them available again, yea you could make a quick buck doing it again, but then people will always wait for the second release. Make some limited time shit unique, add tension, do I wait and hope it comes around again or go for it now.
---
Deathclaws require animal friend rank 3 to tame, despite needing wasteland whisperer to pacify them. Wasteland whisperer is not required to tame deathclaws.

And the railway bridge just northwest of Big B's rest stop in the mire is always a good spot for one.

I think you're replying to the wrong person......

No problem thank you for your generosity. Wish more people would think like this!
---
Two put of the three weeks of vault raids can get you infinite bug spawns with no repercussions to death - you take your junk with you if you die. Get some music on, head to the vault for an hour and just kill the bugs
---
It wasn't an issue before December for me but it seems to be occurring more often since the beginning of December and end of November
---
just wanted to mention here that impro-colt benefits from both pistol and rifle perks (AGI, PER), so i can recommend these highly for snipe-builds. beats any other rifle with perks, its low mainenance cost, 45ammo and pretty moderate vats-cost.
---
Yeah, I've given away stuff that usually goes for 10-20k, but sometimes you just need to do a deal. I had a spare fixer plan that I would have been happy to give someone who really wanted it, but I honestly couldn't find someone on my system who was desperately looking for it. Put up a trade for 5.56 and a completionist jumped on it. Sold it to him for 5k 5.56 which was fair for both of us. If he wanted to wait it out, it's entirely possible he could sell it for much more, but not so much more that he'd end up making a lot more than I did given his initial investment. That's how I like to trade.
---
Of the games in the top 10. That's the only one I've never played. I'm going to though. I've never heard a bad review about it.
---
Yeah, i played other MMOs and run all raids in ESO for example. They're hard. But v94 is just..  ugh.   There's nothing hard actually. Just boring and stupid pixel hunting.
---
Undertale is not in the top 10?
---
Not sure what criteria they used then...
---
I'm on PC
---
Not being ass, but I've not hear of that one. I'll definitely check it out though.
---
Not a good idea. It's more likely that removing the scrip limit would tank any existing economy. Some people already have literaly hundreds of legendaries lying around because they can't sell them all for scrip.
---
Removing the cap would just make the divide between the super rich and the super poor even wider... I seem to have encountered an allegory here..
---
Anyways. Wouldn't recommend.
---
I've only ever once been flamingoed by a stranger, but I found it quite hilarious :)

Nope &amp; nope, you can do neither.

I think we are all doing the same. I was at 24k Sunday. Monday 211. Damn gift wrap

I would not think you are an ass just because you haven't heard about a game.

That would make me an ass.

So, drinking alcohol is fine, i guess?

No more than the usual lag on PC, I just server hop if i get a horrible server.

I got the membership for one month just for the cosmetics and emotes. I was lucky enough to get the advance ranger as well in that months time. The 1650 is a nice bonus.

Although I have mixed opinions, I do intend on picking it up for wastelanders. Just so I don't have people one shotting the new mobs. I want the full experience. 
---
In fact I picked up another month just to grind the Xmas event.
---
I look it up for sure. I'm always up for a good game I might have overlooked. There are a few on this list I'm gunna look into.

Pets for our CAMP that don’t take damage, or maybe even as companions on the road.

Would you be up to selling or trading one?
---
I liked the Halloween event I just wish there were more costumes involved in it.
---
The rotation is nice as long as they don't put a severe gap between them and they're not like meat week. Which I took a break during both times.
---
It would be nice to have legendaries more frequently though because I barely find them without events.
---
This. If you are at the one by Watoga, check NAR - he gets stuck in the fence. For the one near Harpers Ferry, he gets stuck in the forest. You just have to find him and lure him back out.
---
The glitch is that it keeps you in a loop, it plops you down at a random place and 1 second later back to loading screen and then to get another place, etc etc
---
I while back there was talk about cross play, and i was for it thinking it would be great to meet and trade with players across all platforms. After seeing the level of hacking PC users are doing i have now changed my mind and hope they never even consider cross platform. Im on ps4 and happy to play the game as it is.
---
All of the vending will be screwed because everyone on the game and I mean everyone farming. Expect slow sales for a little while.
---
Imma have to agree. Also would like there to be a way you can select the one you want to do instead of having to wait a week to reset
---
im thinking about transfer to consoles too
---
I want one just never used the forum for trades, but just for an alt I started
---
I suspect you can brew "fresh" alcohol, you just have to wait for it to ferment. Once that's done they're indistinguishable from the standard types so they should work the same.
---
I dont blame u, it sucks that when people talk about hacking on pc they kinda lump every pc player into it and that isn't right. I would be worried that anything i traded was duped and eventually get wiped out of my inventory not that that doesn't happen on console.
---
Back in my day I organized my loot into multiple different appropriate themed containers around my house with no limit to how many things fit. And if someone broke into my house I could Suplex them.

get out of the vault

They do work the same. If you have one of the alcohol types in your inventory then just drink that.

Don't drink it until you get somewhere you can complete it.

I was just using a basic concrete floor foundation. I'll note that I've used various Atomic Shop skins on the same floor in the past; I just happened to be using it's default look at the time.
---
A little backdrop: While I had seen someone on another Reddit thread suggest concrete floors were the culprit, a separate user on the beth.net forums claimed that changing the skin of their mesh-top upper floors solved their phantom budget issues. Attempting the latter did not fix my budget, but the concrete floor skin definitely did.

Since this seemingly worked for players using mesh upper floors, my theory is that every time you swap the skin of any floor type, (eg. from default to light wood laminate), you risk losing budget in the process. I don't believe the bug is consistently reproducible, though, as I've often changed the appearance of my floors without any repercussions.
---
And it means the booze works as long as it doesn't say fermentable.
---
I always just carry one of each for these dailies
---
What platform?
---
Fermented drinks never worked for me
---
heres someyhing i found out... before when i fired my explosive gat at my feet in PA id take no damage but recently il take damage as if im not wearing any. i cant pin point the fault as sometimes it works as normal. tried getting out and back in and it dosnt fix it and before and after reload and thats the same. so im unsure whats causing it
---
Sorry ps4
---
Fermented drinks never worked for me, but you aren't the only one saying this so I'll edit the OP :)
---
Robocop classic line 👍
---
Wait about a year and a half more. By then there should be enough content.
---
My Bears I've been collecting have been coming up missing after a few days.  Its starting to p&amp;%s me off, some of those bears are hard to find.  Still trying to figure this one out.
---
They are not able to fix a bug without introducing other 10 and you want them to add snow...
---
Back in my day, I had one toy, and it was a stick!
---
To bad the vault didn't open until late October and the story implies you left last and days and nights happen but surely its always the same day
---
Wish they would put PVP in their own maps.  On PC there are to many ways to hack and cheat.
---
i think that public servers are test servers now until wastelanders launch :D
---
Nice!
---
The way I see it. How much can you get it for, if you buy it now? How many movie tickets is that? If you get more hours of entertainment out of it than you would get for the movie tickets, then it's worth buying.
---
You can do giveaway - I've done it recently on trading subreddit and all people that get their items (one legacy, one ranged, one melee, one armor piece, one rare outfit and one set of rare plans) were very happy. I trade a lot and I'm happy that someone who would struggle to get top-tier items can get something nice for free and would enjoy it.
---
They delayed it, not sure what the new release date is or if there even is one. The safest thing to do would be to assume they’ll be postponing it again.
---
To add on to this it always seems to be “unarmed” enemies that will do the most damage to me.  A single hit from them will take anywhere between 25-50% of my health, meanwhile the ones with guns or a melee weapon will barely scratch me.  Somehow it almost seems as if hostile unarmed damage is completely ignoring armor.
---
I’ve gotten 1000 a couple times from the basic/medium ones.
---
It's only 20 for a few more hours but I'd say yes especially if you like loot and shoot type survival.
---
There's other stuff to do but this is what I enjoy it for. 
---
Wastelanders isn't supposed to be far off either so even just playing casually you would be ready for it.
---
You should it’s a rlly good game, the only downsides is cross platform and a few minor bugs
---
IIRC, Chemist works for gifts but Super Duper doesn't.
---
I would consider October 23 mid October. Yes days and nights happen... but it’s always October 23. And it would be very rare to have snow on October 23 in flatwoods.
---
Think of the damage!!
---
I’d love snow but i cant cope with the snow doing the same damage as a 5.56 or whatever other bug damage glitch would get introduced...
---
All you would see is everyone staying in their camp and continually repairing the roof.
---
It's been bugged since the start and they never reload to full amount. So it's not even on their radar or they don't care or can't fix it ether way it's annoying thinking all this time with every update will it get fixed...
---
Agree with this. Most times when I see something I want in the store I tend to wait for it to be released again at a discount to save a bit. If I wasn't guaranteed that second release I'd definitely spend my atoms a lot more. I had hoped the 4 horsemen PA skins would be limited OG items but they'll be released again I'm sure. Think the whole set was released again recently lol.
---
Honest question, is there really any concern over "rich" and "poor"?  There's nothing in this game that requires you to have maxed out gear (or anywhere near it) and the hard to kill stuff drops garbage loot anyway, and cap limit is attainable by anyone with not much work.    
---
Like what makes someone "poor", and how does other people being "rich" impact that?  How does it limit gameplay?    
---
I honestly don't know if I would be considered rich or poor.
---
I play with a few friends and we just have fun playing together. There is a lot of drama on the forum but the game itself seems to work just fine. We play on both public and private servers and just do adventure mode.

There's a list to my bloodied heavy gunner. I also run a be gattling plasma. Depending on the ammo t of guns you're carrying you can swap out bear arms, but since I'm carrying 11 heavy guns I kinda need it...
---
Sometimes I have gone to peoples bases and just picked up stuff on their trade terminals to get things like robot armor pieces or other weapons. Outside of that I don't have much interaction with other people. I don't know if any of the items I have purchased are duped or not but they are certainly not amazing items.
---
Grape. 
---
The flavor you’re looking for is ‘Grape’. lol
---
Have you seen the unofficial patches the modding community makes for beth games? If you compare them to painters, they are renaissance man.
---
 i did all this solo, wasted so many stims and other chems, constant rad hell is really the dumbest thing ever, and then i get to end and fail it, only to spend 2h in there and get nothing out of it.
---
Then you're in a coma and none of this ever happened it still snows in silent hill.
---
Or a synth and the pipboy never registered you putting it on
---
Yes. It was either a stealth need in the latest patch, or something that was unexpectedly broken in the last patch. Could be anything when it comes to Bethesda.
---
i would not say fallen for it, as it is really mandatory if you play regularly, you need the scap box and a lag free private world if you do some grinding on your own,
---
He does tell you what to do before you drink it. If you listen to make he says after the quest starts he will say something like start a bar fight(melee). But good list though.
---
Low levels you don't notice.  I think you can get a couple hundred hours into the survival campaign before cheaters irk you.  NW on the other hand is different.
---
With this event if you are running places like Glassed Cavern you'll be loaded down quickly.  I've just stopped picking up any one stars once my daily scrips were cashed in, cause selling them is pointless, and most are of no use even to newbs.    
---
The economy of this game was dysfunctional from day one, IMO.  Caps are so easy to max out on, and rare items are so rare that selling them seems like such a waste, assuming you can even hold more caps.  On top of that there's no pvp, and there are virtually no challenging enemies so the most powerful guns are so overkill it doesn't even matter.  I can go out with non legendary gear and have zero issue doing basically anything solo.    
---
I say just take the limits off and let people have fun, personally, but I don't care either way really.
---
every one is naughty and all was just a scam to get you play the game and  buy some atoms
---
Unhostly if we could have unlimited carry weight I'd enjoy the game more, I'd just have to deal with a messy inventory.
---
I gave up a switched him to scrap but I have enough fertilizer to turn Appalachia into a giant farm
---
is it even worth it, do you get anything special from those?
---
2020.
---
Any time is good enough at this point. At launch I would've said wait for a price drop and bug fixes, but it's been over a year and all we've gotten is the price drop. You could wait for Wastelanders, but at this point who knows when that's coming? Supposed to be first quarter 2020, but in Bethesda speak that could mean anything.
---
There was news that the new workers they got plus the funding from fo1st has pushed the update ahead to probably the first couple months
---
I saw that to, im on ps4
---
Nah. It's good now, but all year round would suck.
---
I'd like it it if they use this idea for other holidays though. Costumed Feral Ghouls for Halloween would be tight.
---
&gt;I'm bored with killing scotch
---
An alkohol problem is nothing to brag about. 😂

10mm SMG is under commando
---
sigh... these muricans asking for snow meanwhile i'm here with 85°+ everyday lol
---
Yes, it's gotten to the point where I play even less than I already was. Yesterday I logged on to dump my legendaries for scrip and sell other stuff for caps. Then I did one Uranium Fever,.sold some more stuff for caps, then got off. No point in staying on, I got my limit in less than an hour.
---
When did they add the small back packs?
---
Thank you!
---
It is a terrible game made by an incompetent developer. They have broken the game significantly in every 'patch'. Microtransactions have become more and more aggressive and Bethesda is on record bold face lying about them being cosmetic only. It is a cash grab intended to suck the money out of the loyal Fallout fan base. Do not buy this game.
---
\*Taps head\* You can't run out of time when you carry 360 minutes worth of buff for every single alcohol.
---
Used to be 400.
---
my friends would just build all types of penises with stash and balls in my camp lol
---
As someone who have these floors I kind of wish to remain unique but at the same time I get why people want them.
---
It's around a 1% chance for it to give you a gift. Bethesda failed to mention that. Instead just saying that's it's free so that's wed rejoice and praise them again.
---
no there isnt. scrapbox in fallout1st is unlimited for components.
---
try excavator with shocked legs (+200lbs).
---
use weight reduction perks, dont keep any food in box use tru-hiker perk.
---
mod armor to ultralight if you stash them in box.
---
do boyscout challenges to get backpack (small one is free at morgantown airport).
---
thats my tips.
---
It is strange that there's no Santa hat in the shop. Unless it's coming closer.to Christmas. Not that I'd actually buy it, but still.
---
Instead of spamming your "brotherhood", you could have helped OP and given the solution.
---
It'll be interesting to see what becomes of this. This is a serious hack that really shouldn't have been allowed to go for a single day. PC is fucked and I don't think Bethesda can unfuck it. If I were to put money on it I would bet that nothing is done for at least two weeks and even then Bethesda might just throw their hands up and just let it happen.
---
Sorry to be the bearer of the news, but you need to delete "free version" and redownload the game through the launcher.
---
Which nuke zone?
---
Give Bethesda more money via a subscription.
---
No,I don't think I will.
---
I have heard (and from a layman’s point of view it makes sense) that lots of cargobots there is a good indication of server stability.  Lots of cargobots there means the server has been up for a long while.
---
I've been hoping for a king but no luck they're never alone
---
thank you for your courage!
---
Sorry, adding snow would probably introduce another game-breaking bug
---
That would probably not be easy to do.
---
Got nothing to do with you champ. 
---
I don't know how to solve that problem, what I can offer is help to new players. Which they are. 
---
Jeez I really hope that I never end up as salty as this guy in life...
---
The answer is no. Mobs do not get harder to kill when you're in a Team
---
Too much radiation exposure
---
Someone nuked the SBQ on my server last night. I decided to join. We got her to about half health, and I died and got the unable to respawn glitch.
---
So, had to reset the game. About 20 minutes on a new server, lucky me, another SBQ nuke! So, I tried participating again. Well, we managed to kill her this time. But, I got no completion XP, just the single legendary for killing her. And when I went to loot her, nothing on her body.
---
What a lovely game.
---
Beth only fixed the bug where you couldn't get the nades, nothing more. They did not fix the basic arty bug.
---
My guess is that they'll wait another few months because in their mind the arty has already gone through "bugfixing".
---
That's the hardest part of the game right there, the real end game boss!!!  Haven't been killed in game in months but that damn box fight man, I tell ya what!!
---
Ty &lt;3
---
Gotta be either the bloody chef outfit, the padded blue jacket, or the surveyor outfit.
---
I love the regular person look
---
Are you a lower level playing with higher level friends?  Might be spawning in higher level enemies than you are usually doing solo.  Or are you going to higher level areas with said friends than you normally stick to solo?
---
The hardest learning curve, IMO, for all of us used to hoarding everything from previous FO titles is exactly this...REAL inventory management.  
---
As soon as I got it through my head that I don't actually NEED to have all this JUNK all the time and gear for every possible scenario I might encounter, my game opened up.
---
Look at the components you need to use the most...weapon, armor, and ammo requirements along with food and water, these should be your only priorities...anything after this is just gravy.
---
If you find you just cannot manage, there are a few options like mentioned in previous posts and/or you could always buy another copy of the game while it's on sale.
---
Remember though it's a persistent multiverse and most all of that stuff is always out there.
---
It might be harder to stay stealthed when teamed up, so you'd lose the damage bonus from that.
---
thats true, enjoy it while it lasts
---
&gt; When it says fresh it simply means NOT CRAFTED at a brewing station. So buy or find the drink, DO NOT brew it.
---
Nope.  "fresh" means anything but "fermentable".  In other words "fresh" means "not fresh".  Buy it or brew it and ferment it, no problemo.
---
Mods incoming.
---
 Thread Locked.
---
User banned for racism.
---
Think about it, all the junk from alle the people, and them hoarding unending amounts, no no NO, the servers CAN'T handle that!
---
Unless ofc you pay Bethesda 10$ a month, then anything is suddenly possible
---
NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
---
I think you'll find it's *fermentable* that doesn't work, not *fermented*.
---
That's just lag.  You have to wait around a couple of more seconds before killing them and they should go green smoke to legendary.  🤷‍♂️
---
"I'm filled to the brim with extra items I got from an event, how unfair!"     
---
People need to stop complaining about every little decision they have to make. Give it to low levels or sell it, and move on with your life!
---
I don't think there is ever a good time to buy this clusterfuck of a game.
---
Lol, fine 😄
---
Its amateur hour at Bethesda again. Unbelievable that we are a year in and they still can't get a handle on hackers and cheats. It seems as soon as one dupe is "fixed" another takes its place.
---
That's a Texas sized 10'4
---
There's no proof of this, other than sometimes you get more than one of the same prefix in a row by chance sometimes. What makes you think they make the RNG of the purveyor change per server to give more bloodied than another?
---
I did this and it worked :)
---
Forest camp jumpsuit, camo combat helmet, green bandana, and welding goggles.
---
Hmm, maybe try having a friend build it at their camp and trying to use it? Its a guarantee at a friends place.
---
Just one movie ticket (without the student discount) and popcorn. The price of this game really dropped.
---
Every day is reclamation day. I don’t know why you are arguing haha
---
I don't believe Bethesda has said.
---
&gt; I know its had alot of issues to include hackers,bugs,griefers and a questionable season pass
---
Hackers:  On PC, and mostly in NW as I understand it.
---
Bugs: Yup.  Fewer now than at other periods, but there are still bugs.
---
Griefers: Very rare in my experience (PS4, Eur), may be more common on some other platforms or regions.
---
Season pass: If you don't want it, don't buy it.  I haven't.
---
I expect it to require a low level since a lot of players will jump into the game just because of this update.  Doesn't make a lot of sense to lock something this big behind a high level requirement.
---
Don't forget that it's way more buggy and glitchy than FO4 also. That's an important distinction to make.
---
its a known bug for months, but mostly occure by explosive weapons
---
I'm guessing you already played more than 2h? And you liked it so easy decision.
---
I remember the 400 stash limit and I remember the days before the collections and shit. But like even 800 isnt enough we need another stash increase just like the camp budget
---
No big problems on PS4 (pro), I see more complaints from PC players frankly.
---
What?
---
Hope you had pacifist on, or it's be a good way of tricking you into PvP.
---
I acknowledged that one but the mob only heals for a while and then the next round of shots should kill em but this ,its not even explosive nor legacy ..
---
I'm not saying that they just need to flip a switch but it's more than doable with limited hassle
---
I bought it for $10 on Black Friday. Have put hardly any time into it at all. Hard to get in to for me, rather unlike the past 3 titles released were. I'm told it's better to play with others. Based on what I've seen playing it so far, I would not spend more than $10 on it and actually would kind of rather have the $10 back. Of course the general opinion around here will be biased toward "absolutely go buy it!" Just look at all the downvotes I'll get.
---
I have to feed my char every 5 minutes, totally increased by 250%.
---
Pfff, I can make it snow *anytime I want*. What is situational about that?
---
I bought them, and will be using them **24/7/365**. Well worth the money.
---
I did, won't ever do it again, I thought it would be nice to be able to take workshops and not have anybody take it over. But the fucking game still freezes up, I'm pretty much done with this game.
---
Well I think that is a complex thing to answer, but I will try as best as I understand it.
---
See, in every MMO there comes a time when the meta ("current gameplay mechanics and power levels") change and everything that used to be "good" or "overpowered" becomes either obsolete or de-valuated (for reference, see the release of "The Burning Crusade" expansion for World of Warcraft). That is all well and good and should be part of any release cycle to keep things fresh and interesting for the players. Sometimes this type of mechanic is referred to as a "power squish".
---
The problem comes in when some players can buy their way to the new current meta without actually playing the game further. It reduces playtime and enjoyment for almost everyone involved. It is always important to keep some sort of balance, so the experienced players don't get bored and the newer players don't get too overwhelmed and thus leave the game. 
---
If, for example, some basic weapon starts to cost 50.000caps just because people have that kind of money lying around, you know the balance starts to get skewed. We all know Fo76 isn't the most balanced game around but there are a few things that are there for a reason and some measures need to be there for balance purposes (in my oppinion, anyways)
---
Some people call daily cap/scrip limits bullshit and a way to just waste a players time, but it also encourages players to come back to the game regularly and thus create steady stream of players. I think this is not much of a problem in a game where you only have an entry fee and no running cost (just a reminder that lots of mmo's need monthly payments to keep playing)
---
I hope this answeres you question at least somewhat.
---
I personally love the X-mas emotes, they're worth it just for the snow animations.
---
I said situational,not temporary. Would you use chrismas emote in may and look like a moron?  That's like never taking out decorations in real life.
---
We're they in a display? If they were just in your stash box they probably got scrapped when you crafted or repaired something
---
Yes
---
K. I have my opinion and you sure won't change it lol.
---
How much can you get it for at the moment? How many movie tickets is that? Even if you only enjoy a couple of hours it's worth it. With every content update you can add a couple of movie tickets worth of entertainment, for free.
---
Making them stealable does nothing to make them less of a burden on the server. Multiple independent chests with different things in them that are meant to be persistent would probably actually just make the server load worse.
---
No presents here either - probly about 20 hours of play time, checking back frequently - not a single present through the robot, including like another posting running multiple with workshops.
---
There is one way to know: find a full set of unyielding armor. That means all stats at 20-30 whatever your specialization. Test and choose. 
---
My rifleman is rifle main, machete second.
---
My unarmed is unarmed first, crossbow second. But first doesn't mean you can't kill most enemies from a distance: the punches come when required and instakill.
---
HEY!   I leave up my decorations til May...  *grumbles*
---
Is there any correlation between the size of the gift and the level of quality what's inside?
---
And I answered before reading it was PvP. Just go commando.
---
In addition to the things already mentioned...
---
its as close to a single player version as you can get.
---
There actualy is Snow in Fallout Shelter
---
strange, maybe another bug
---
I was going to respond differently until i read ur user name. U most likely do this to get a rise out of people or ur just an angry  person behind a keyboard. Believe it or not u didnt have to respond to this post, people will find someway to get by with out ur words of wisdom. But either thanks for the comment
---
Ah, the "good ol days". These young un's don't know how good they have it. Took an hour, just to farm your daily cap limits, and it was uphill the whole way.
---
The past held both good and bad times, I learned the value of mules quickly, and even though my stash box had a 400 limit, thanks to the camp duplication bug, (the one Bethesda called an exploit), I crammed 77K lbs of junk in that box, then distributed it across the wasteland, to over encumber my opponents.
---
That's the plan
---
No ! It just works.
---
cool story bro
---
Thanks, I've seen this said before. I think I'm going to try it.
---
welcome to our world :)
---
the map is divided into areas called the forest (green, left middle), the toxic valley (top left, beige-ish), ash heap (black/dark grey, bottom left), savage divide (strip down the middle of the map), the Mire, top and middle right), and the Bog (lower right). 
---
As you explore the forest, you'll pick up missions and quests.  The overseers quest will likely be the first one you find.  Stay with it, and it will keep you in more or less level appropriate areas.
---
Each area is tailored to a range of levels.
---
Forest: 1-15 or so
---
Toxic Valley : 15-25
---
Ash heap : 25-35
---
Savage Divide: 35-45
---
Mire and bog : 45 +
---
All this for a mere 20 $
---
Are u on ps4? We can revive each other?
---
Crong sbadenk
---
I meant low level players. I have done glass cavern and fusion sites all night. I like some low level players, but most servers are 3/4 low levels because of the free weekend.
---
Not even close to the worst game of 2019! I’ve been playing it all year. I’ve jumped out of it for Borderlands 3 and Outer Worlds but keep coming back.
---
Yeah, its great. I was on the fence about it too for ages but bought it cheap and ended up loving it. Massive fascinating world to explore, CAMP building is fine, always enjoy running across other players in the Wastelands, and honestly didn't find it that buggy at all (especially not compared to all the stuff I'd seen online.) 
---
Sunk hundreds of hours into the game now and really enjoyed it. It's a blast. West Virginia setting is awesome too. The only downside is that most of the quests aren't great -- mostly glorified fetch quests -- and definitely the weakest part of the game compared to NV, F04 etc.
---
How about some rad snow?
---
All that tells me is you don't know what a good game is clearly.  But whatever you do you bud. 
---
I wouldn't support a game company who makes it so clear and obvious they dont care about you. They care about money only.
---
&gt; Would you use chrismas emote in may and look like a moron?
---
That's the plan.
---
Sure. I’ll “do me” and not troll game communities of games that I don’t like.
---
Snows actually a known buffer for radiation. So hell we could have rad free zones temporarily
---
No there are scorched that are legendary outside of this s Christmas event
---
Roadtripper and Christmas Elf are basically GOAT
---
Agreed. Until you know what you’ll be using regularly, about 100 max of each component is sufficient. And once you know where certain junk is abundant, you can just make a quick run to restock. 
---
Like, when I need to restock on Rubber, Grafton Middle School is my go to spot. 81 rubber in about three minutes, and there’s a Tinkers Workbench on the north side in a school bus.
---
Not sure which platforms you are considering but it's worth noting that hackers are only a problem on PC.
---
Yeah, I’ve noticed the Line in the Sand one will just sit on the ground behind the building sometimes.
---
(: worth every sec
---
So frustrating!
---
I still don't see a reason to waste caps on presents... 
---
You can easily farm 20+ presents an hour.
---
All of the rewards are on the market for a pretty low price.
---
I'll save my caps for the next cap sink.
---
GT HasNoStyle
---
While this is true, if they skip the first "season" of the game, they will miss the whole backstory, which I'm sure will all be useful info during Wastelanders. You might have to do the main story that we currently have to access all Wastelanders content.
---
I have a bloodied prim lmg I use for sbq but for the most part I just use a 50 cal for farming or casual.
---
Thanks that’d gonna be very handy :)
---
Store it don’t scrap it
---
Known bug particularly with Tesla FFR.  Mine does it from time to time after continuous use.  Sometimes I alternate between weapons to reduce the chances of is happening. Carry a good melee with you as a backup when this happens to get yourself out of a pinch.  Restarting the game fixes it.
---
Alright, noted. Thank you ;)
---
It's not even a 2019 game, it was released in 2018 you melon.
---
Ok thank you, gonna stick with automatic pistols.
---
Mods on jumpsuit alright, noted. :)
---
Yep. Exactly
---
Game is been better than ever after the successful launch of Fallout 1st
---
Back in my day we'd open treasure maps and look at them while in the middle of combat.
---
Oh wait- that was yesterday.
---
Yeah that's how bad it still is. 2019 is the year they promised the biggest content update the game every would have seen. It's also the same year they decided to not give us that update and instead try to make us give them more money for a broken ass game with nothing in it. Then those paid things didn't even work right.... yup.. worst game.
---
A quick 2x2 set of foundations and railings around 3 sides of the base can fit a tent and small generator really comfortably and organically. One tent for living in, and another for crafting benches and you've got a super mobile cosy realistic camp!
---
I've made over 100 of them. Chemist does double them, but Super Duper doesnt proc.
---
I haven't done it personally but captainoob on youtube has videos where he tests weapons by soloing the qyeen. See what you think based on that.
---
On an unrelated note:  Repair kits are on sale!
---
Oh yeah 100 percent, I think since last patch or patch before.. I think maybe we have been spoiled up to that point, mine seldom broke
---
There are definitely people running around with hacked 5* weapons on the PC right now.  Hopefully this gets patched away (and the items removed) today.
---
The homemade ones are the main reason higher drop rates and the plasma grenade plans.
---
Good thing that's not a nightmare to repair or anything.
---
It’s not a photoshop, I know people who have been given them.
---
It's always the same. Solo killing her is fun though, brings somewhat of a challange to the game.
---
That's a good idea.
---
Less bugs..
---
Nice I got t a bloodied fss deathclaw gauntlet

I generally run around looking like the Wicked Witch of the West, although this week I've been running round in my skeleton costume.

I don't, I'm afraid

blade or chain it for extra damage.

Personally, I prefer the 3\* chefs rolling pin.

It is legit.  I know people who have them.  People are able to create 5 star weapons out of thin air using some sort of script. I don’t know the details on how it works, but I do have very trustworthy friends send me screen shots of items they have been given using this process.  They have also been given SUPER rare items like the Fasnacht Sun Mask (or whatever it’s called).  
---
Some of the 5* weapons have been given bonuses that I don’t believe exist in the game either, like the ability to “stagger” on each shot.
---
More space? No, but if you manage inventory it’s not that bad. You shouldn’t carry a lot of excess armor or weapons. Scrap all junk. Bulk and sell what you don’t need. Manage the amount of fusion cores and. Meds you carry (super stims are insanely heavy).
---
Man, people are making the most overpowered weapons with this hacking shit.
---
I am still the opposite of anti hoarder lol my carry weight fully loaded for battle is 50 to 80 pounds depending on how much ammo I have. I have 1 stim pack for ressing peeps 10 quantum colas and 10 nuka grapes.
---
I bought it and was about to mod it, but I ran out of adhesive
---
Yeah it’s annoying.
---
That's a beautiful photo.
---
It was never promised for September. 
---
But yes it was delayed for Q1, 2020. They did add a little mystery to solve as a teaser if you visit the grafton pawn shop.
---
*Slow clap for Bethesda*
---
This hame always finds ways to amaze me. 🤣
---
It's a good spot when you first visit it. Your second or someones else's first is going to be a bit lackluster compared to the first visit. Becuase Spawns are there but the Ultracite is usually mined.
---
I wouldn’t mind buying just one individual emote, just to spread some Christmas cheer. But I’m not spending 840 atoms on several others I would never use.
---
Ah good to know, what about the scrap box what's the difference there
---
Does ut actually work
---
I think that's the FO 1st box.  No experience with that one.  I'd guess it was the same, but IDK.
---
If your doing semi/auto rifle build, max out Per and Agility, second highest is luck. This is my layout but I ended up moving one one extra point into End for Radicool for the extra str points.

---
Which also means that things have been looted/ server shutdown could be coming soon.
---
This is why I don't trade.
---
If I were to trade I wouldn't be giving up my items 1st for any reason.
---
Lesson learned I guess.
---
No, it’s just a baseball bat essentially, but the fact that it exists, proves these people don’t care.
---
For me personally I would never buy any emotes for any reason.
---
Yeah, tell me about it. Just putting the word out there so nobody else gets burned by SniperQueen1992.
---
Found this thread at Zero... Why.. the man is posting a bug he has.. I voted you up again.
---
I had the same thing happen to me.. (being voted down on a bug reported) Don't understand this behavior from the group????? My issue still is having full AP but can't walk just because I'm 1lb over carry weight.
---
Master race
---
Find some friends, the social aspect of the game is what keeps it interesting, make sure you have a good Headset/Mic, most people play using party chat.
---
I'm over 3000 hours in and still can't wait to get home from work to play each day.
---
That’s why there’s couriers tho.
---
did the excavator quest at level 30.  i ran it for 25 more levels, then upgraded.  now trying to build and cannot
---
That’s the thing.  
---
This games dying, Bethesda’s making sure of that, but the handful of new players or alts, all need to start somewhere. 
---
Unyielding,bloodied,vanguard stuff, even 1* should be sold for 1-2k caps tops. 
---
That shit will turn a profit, you just adapt and go higher volume instead of trying to pop a quick 25-50k a month (new players won’t have that and won’t know how to do +&gt;25k anyways). 
---
These people, if treated right, will also become your serum buyers, then your 10k 2* buyers, then finally, your end game item buyers.
---
the bat in question does not appear to be a hack.
---
Search this forum or Google "reddit fallout 76 allstar bat" and you'll find references to it (and legendary versions thereof) back to (at least) Jan 2019.
---
I’ve written “Penis” a few times in a couple random camps... can’t lie.
---
I farmed there exclusively for the first few months of the game - liked the spawn rates and I grabbed everything for a while.
---
The main issue with the raid is the timer or the lack of checkpoints... not lag not nothing... just those things.
---
I don't recommend buying  or accepting any of these cheat items. When Bethesda gets around to another ban wave, they'll probably throw the net wide and round up anyone who touched one of these things.
---
Can you drag me? I can keep up! What is your PSN ID?
---
That’s a bo us, esp lucky hole, but just in general.
---
I do westek / other runs in excavator, because no one wants to farm caps while eating up supplies to “gain carry weight”- counter productive.
---
you probably have a perk or legendary effect active that makes the weapon lighter when you have it in your inventory then it would be without those perks im quite sure the missile launcher actually weighs something like 30 pounds thats why you dont have enough stashspace
---
Don't forget to keep modding, once mod melee weapon is done another opens to mod one handed melee, and then bladed weapon afterwards (or in the other order, but combat knife counts for both of those).
---
I always get mine from the cranberry glade down in the bog
---
Can I add you? Magness1993
---
It's worth a try
---
I failed on my first try but succeeded on my second. Also check out angry turtles clip on yo utube. After watching captainnoob &amp; angryturtle I thought it's worth a shot.
---
Yes it is big difference, it saves 10-15 seconds loading into a game and about 5-10 seconds on a fast travel compared to internal HDD.
---
Are you using weight reduction armor? It doesn’t affect the stash box so a missile launcher that weighs 16 on your person still weighs 24 in the stash box.
---
I’m sure it’s fine, because they know these are being given away, therefore a banwave would hit a lot of innocent people. It’s just annoying that things like this exist.
---
Still I'm not handing my weapons or armor off to somebody I don't know.
---
 Been wanting to trade my AAE gatling laser for months because i dont need or want heavy weapons. I'm just waiting for some kind of better trading system ingame.
---
 Until then it will sit and collect dust in my stash Box.
---
The normal bats don't tend to have exploding bullets normally
---
Yeah that’s fine I was just saying until they give us a viable trade system the couriers exist so you can safely trade items
---
Ooohhhh.... Well, dont drink Nukashine kids. It leads you down a dark path.
---
I'm on xbox, but even if I wasn't after all the caps I've spent on wrapping paper it is sadly too rich for my blood now :(  This event has really put me in the poor house  lol
---
Problem is, somebody has to give up an item first when trading straight up and not selling for caps.
---
That’s... what the couriers are for. Both parties give their items to a third party courier who then exchanges the items. That way no one runs off with anything
---
Right, a melee weapon with double ammo capacity and exploding bullets, seems very legit and not a hack
---
What do you mean you cannot build it? Do you have the materials?
---
This is just a cash shop with a barely functioning interactive mode. Why do people continue to tolerate Bethesda?
---
Exactly. 
---
People were warned this was coming.
---
If you disconnect in a private server you will not lose your workshops when rejoining the server.
---
Oh!  I missed that part.  I just saw the name and starts, didn't read the description
---
Dang fine print - gets me every time
---
I
---
I’m rather surprised we can’t actually scrip it?..
---
I find that's what happens with most people. Think about how many melee enemies hit from ground level. Dogs, ants, moles.....shooting them near your feet with explosive weapons makes it worse.
---
Also GINGERBREAD HOUSES!!
---
There is never too much of Atom's love. Accept his glowing embrace
---
There’s currently even 5 and 10 star weapons in the game, with the free weekend the cheats got out of control
---
I do every time, unless there is someone else on my server
---
I see that you are also a player of quality
---
Thanks! I'll remember this!
---
HOW DO I UPVOTE THIS TWICE
---
Some people are total dimwits...why must they always ruin everything???Play like a normal person and stop hacking!!!I never liked the idea of cheating in a game and i'm not gonna start now!
---
Bet you hated the Pride frame too
---
I’m on about pastafarians and those who pray to the almighty atom. This isn’t a witch hunt for religions which should definitely be left off this Reddit thread.
---
I think its never been different till now.
---
If you make repairs it will scrap items in stash automatically. 
---
I know where all the bears are, and you can google too. There are static spawns for all of them so not too hard to replace thankfully
---
That is pretty damn annoying isn't it lol
---
I never listened to reviews.I read them to get the general gist of a game,but i never take them seriously!Always like to form my own opinion on a game and FO76 is a good game from the get go!
---
Does it have issues?You bet it does!But it's fun and i like the whole scheme on the game
---
Yah I'm pissed about the same thing. I have 2 copies of 76 and it's killed the disk drives in 2 PS4s I still have my PS4 pro to use but can't play the other 2 because this game kills drives. 
---
Wanted it cheaper and it's not even in the year end sale
---
Back in my days level 30 was a lot
---
What is couriers never heard of it
---
Not really a story, just advice.
---
It's just a skin for buildings they could put together a team and have it done by the end of the day
---
There’s groups of couriers on reddit over in the market sub that will do trades so people don’t steal your stuff. They normally have a high karma / history of good trades and have to go thru a process to get approved
---
Ah, I melee but I've taken to jumping around *lots* to avoid most hits, so this would explain it.
---
basically this.  I'm like everyone else in this thread, YEAH SNOW WOULD ROCK but when you think about what it would take to do, you switch to "ooooh yeah never mind.... fix the other broken stuff first kthx"
---
Try cdkeys
---
They were an award for the Fastnacht Event, so unless a player vendor is selling them you'd have to wait until that comes around again.
---
It's alright I joined a server right in front of a player vendor who had the serum.
---
Yeah this ain’t a raid, it’s just a grocery list simulator mixed with gun play, I’ve played all kinds of raids across different games, this is the one that doesn’t feel like a raid.
---
How about fixing the current hacker problem first.  
---
Creating custom weapons, and spawning anything they want into the game is a way better issue to be focusing on.
---
This is the best way to determine someone actively looking for a weapon and not being able to obtain it.  Random handouts could go bad quick - but you can tell someone searching fruitlessly pretty easily on the trading sites.
---
Its ehh ive dont it with me and a plus one same lvl as i and we got her down to 30% b4 server crashed sadly... it wasent bad but ate ammo
---
this.
---
as soon as enemies are fighting someone/something you dont get sneak bonuses
---
Just have a bank toon problem solved i have 3 xD
---
By the way sorry for my english if it's strange.
---
Back in my day spaghetti dogs ran rampant through nuke zones, the mayor's safe in Watoga would hand out 8 stimpaks a day, wanted players with 10,000 cap bounties roamed the wasteland, and scorchbeasts were a VATs-only battle because you were blinded by a constant bombardment of sonic screeches and couldn't see shit.
---
Let people do what they want. Until wastelanders the market is dead anyway
---
You are not the first one who had this happen. Same shit happened on the last "free weekend".
---
Or, ask the community if someone could stop by and place some? You can move them where you want them. Just a thought.
---
It was at 20€ friday.
---
WV doesnt get much snow in real life , why would it get it in game ?
---
Yeah I mean I get all that, my point really is that while I could easily be considered "poor" as I just have a mishmash of armor I found on kills, and a one star armor ignore level action, I can one hit kill everything outside of a few monsters, all of which I am perfectly capable of fighting.  I don't think there really is a very functional difference between someone kitted out with the best gear and someone with low level shiz because the power level of monsters compared to players is so dramatically low.    
---
The problem I think is that 76 ISN'T really an mmo.  It's a single player game, with a single player game loop. It's really 95% FO4 with a multiplayer mod tacked on.  It was never designed, or balanced from an MMO experience perspective.  So unless they add on a whole new tier of monsters SBQ level and/or higher, gear wealth has very diminishing returns, and your currency wealth is essentially nonexistent as any level 10 character can have max caps in under a month literally just selling wild blackberries and trash.  I honestly don't know that they will even add that "end game" tier either.  I have a feeling that the new stuff we get will be similar to the stuff we have now.  A sea of trash mobs, and a imposter sheepsquatch level "boss".  We'll just have to wait and see what wastelanders has to offer.        
---
There's just a fundamental value problem at the heart of the games experience.  Everything is weak so OP weapons are really nothing more than fun for the fun of it, and the currency cap is so low that rare items have to sell for far far less than they are worth in effort it requires to attain them.  If you balance time required to get something, a really good meta 3 star should be worth like 200-300k caps, realistically.  Because it can takes months, and months and months to find one.  THe overall balance on the game is just... really really off, and the progression process seems to have not been considered really at all, and there's really no "end game" to pursue like any other mmo would have.    
---
76 just seems like a regular fallout game, with the focus being on exploration, narrative, resource management, rather than the MMO gearing up to fight progressively stronger endgame foes.
---
I have heard this but I am not the sharpest with what hardware I should get. Anyone have a moment to help a brother out by linking some amazon items I should pick up? My load times are terrible.
---
Wait there is a twitch prime thing in fo76?
---
more materials than i can possibly use!  i am not given the choice when at the power armor station to build it.  even went back and did the whole quest again.  cannot build it.  so annoying
---
That was a joke...nothing about the bat is overpowered.
---
thank you so much.  been looking forever.
---
I tried this solo as well, and I could not stand the endless waves of ghouls while searching the for keycards. They weren't difficult to fend off, but it was a complete distraction to focus, there was very little time to spare between waves and it kept causing me to walk right by a card as I was getting pummeled. It was also easy mode... I enjoyed the mission with the mirelurks, but having to run around fetching items in this current mission, just doesn't feel like a raid at all.
---
They need to come out with matchmaking and servers really need to stabilize from all this lag.
---
I'm not demanding that everyone stops buying wrapping paper... I'm just informing them that they can save money if they purchased the items they need from players.
---
you want stealth
---
most people use automatic rifles/sneak builds because there isnt much downside to using automatic instead of semiauto
---
that said riflemen can be very powerfull but they lack the dps to efficiently fight the queen
---
sadly the plasmarifle doesnt work well with stealth but the lever/gauss/hunting rifles can be oneshotting pretty much anything with sneak attacks and headshots
---
I’m NO expert but I run Rifleman perk cards with a Handmade for normal usage and a Lever Action for longer range shots. If I go to a SBQ fight I switch those cards out for the ones that apply to automatic weapons (can’t remember the name right now) and bring a LMG and Gatling Laser. Idk if that’s helpful or not?
---
Yeah i wanna see snow!
---
That is really bizarre
---
but this is an actually fun money sink.
---
Yep , i've update the main post with the link
---
You do you. I'm just informing people that they can save some caps.
---
Don't mean to be an asshole.. but as someone sitting on 14 known serum plans (my cap sink) .. Save money for WHAT exactly?
---
Thanks for an in-depth reply.
---
I still just don't get it.... but solely in regards to FO76. I understand for MMOs and whatnot.. I understand how their systems work. But just not 76's.
---
100k caps seems low as hell... though to be fair, I don't remember the general worth/pricing of items as much as I do the other Fallout titles.
---
Idk what I'm trying to say honestly. But if I can get 100k caps in New Vegas before reaching max level, these guys grinding at the game for way longer *should* be able to have more purchasing power than I do.
---
(Again, maybe they do.. I can't remember how the different economies compare.. but I'm still doubtful.)
---
If you did the quest you crafted it already. If you can't craft the PA set on a PA chassis at a power armor station. You need an empty chassis. If you still can't craft it, look at the terminal in garrahan mining R&amp;D area.
---
I feel sorry for the genuine PC players. Little out of hand I think. Past time for them to do something.
---
"ALOT" is the one spelling mistake that everyone capitalizes for visibility.
---
Lots of Mr. Fuzzy bears and a bunch of junk for me...no gifts. I didn't lock my santatron though so maybe visitors are raiding any gifts that have dropped in there. From the sound of it though, I guess that is unlikely!
---
weapon durability is also degrading a lot faster. my harpoon gun now breaks in about 25 shots compared to like the 150+ shoots before the patch
---
For future more valuable and worth while cap sinks.
---
For a needy noob.
---
For a friend who's just shy of affording the gun they want to purchase.
---
For yourself. The ability to purchase an item in the future that you don't know you want yet.
---
Maybe in other countries, but this is AMERICA!  Even our baseball bats shoot things and explode!  WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
ALL PRAISE THE ALMIGHTY ATOM
---
I was enjoying the durability that came from a bug in patch 14, it was corrected in patch 15, and I haven't seen a difference with the last patch (16), I run a lot of SBQ battles and recently dropped 70 improved repair kits to get my stash down to 200, I prefer to repair at the workbench to get the 200% condition, but frequently use the repair kits just to use them up.
---
Many players are also commenting that they are struggling with Hunger and Thirst issues since the last update, but I believe this is actually due to the fact that they are using more Radaway which increases that because of spending more time near Fissure sites.
---
The guys at Bethesda have said that they won't give lost items back.
---
Oh well.
---
Wait until you hear the "ping". That's when you know its dry and hes reloading the baseball bat. But you have to be quick, it reloads 15% faster.
---
I mean, they are not wrong.
---
It all depends what you're trying to do with your build. My junkies build is set up for commando, rifleman, and gunslinger. I use my jffr handmade for stuff like the queen and raids, or events that spawn lots of enemies at once and need more crowd control. That's the real downside to the non-auto weapons, the clip size and reload time. 
---
I run a junkies explosive lever action for most of my PvE though. I still 1 shot most things with a sneak crit to the face and I keep it regular, un primed because a lot enemies and ammo boxes give .45 so it's great on ammo. For that I run almost the same cards as my commando set up, so it's easy to just swap the 3 rifleman/commando cards back and forth.
---
this winter event is better than the Halloween one for sure
---
Wow never thought of that solution
---
Well it is what it is. I kinda figured when I dropped it I was kinda screwed and there was no way to get it back, but thank you very much for the help!!
---
Im not mutated but it still feels that way
---
i want caldwell's helm
---
Caps won't buy top tier guns and armour anyway
---
That helps. I'll jyst dump some points into i think it's Commando(?) To get more auto rifle damage. I'm only lv. 44 atm but was just thinking about nukes and raids and was trying to be more prepared for all that the best i can be.
---
this is a little off topic, but how do you use mules?  do you have to have a middleman?
---
Yep, they have been there since launch
---
It has never been promised.
---
Point being it’s still very enjoyable for $20.
---
You know there's a ban wave coming on Thursday, right?
---
I did the same thing, just after the second I scrapped it, it dawned on me that it was the skin. My own fault, I read the messaged and proceeded to scrap anyway. Just a response to say I feel your pain. And guarantee we will be told “Tango Sierra” (tough shit)
---
"Oh no, he criticized the game in a post about rampant hacking on the game... Shills assemble!!"
---
I don’t mind it. Been looking to get rid of the caps anyway
---
We said the same once. Guess what, that is one year ago. So no, this time I just wait for reviews before l’m coming back. Not enough repairs in a whole year for me.
---
I personally would recommend commando, especially if your build is being used for pvp. Although you can always do half and half
---
Question, i actually got a lever action yesterday that has +30% damage to scorched enemies, would that be more effective against SBQ? Or would i be better off getting a Gatling Laser gun or Lmg or something for nuke drops?
---
Yeah well 99% of the players in this game hate PvP so good luck with that.  
---
Was at a train station today mixing it up with another player and someone my level 250+ fast travels in so we shift our focus to that guy and he flips out on his mic telling me he’s reporting me and blah blah blah.  If you have pacifist on who cares?  Or if you don’t want to PvP don’t return fire.
---
Heavy weapons and non pa isn’t very viable - Stabilized is a game changer for heavies.
---
Awesome, thanks. I'll try getting a auto rifle and some commando cards then.
---
You just sounded very entitled. Maybe they should remove cap limits. Carry weight. Hunger/thirst. Why not. You don't want to struggle to decide what to keep, but you also don't want to give anything away. Don't ask what other people think if you're not prepared to hear you sound entitled.
---
And if it's not, I assume you're going to give them their $20 back?
---
Believe it or not, not everyone will like this game, even after trying it. The current number of players should be evidende enough.
---
800 caps is chump change. I’ve given more to random players.
---
well it works on the SBQ but your overall dps wouldnt be enough
---
but you can participate in the event by shooting the mobs on the ground your lever would be good for that
---
the melee players who deal great damage to the queen are thankfull if someone holds there back succesfully 👍🏼
---
I personally, have issues only with ammo factory... But mostly avoid workshops now with disconnects. Annoys the hell out of me
---
Yeah but...I like the dice roll. Just going out and buying what I want isn't as fun. I'd much rather spend 10K on wrapping paper and find a plasma grenade plan than 8K to just buy one off someone.
---
Id like a frying pan to wear on my head, to protect me from the rain. A drying pan.
---
Almost happened with my t51 power armor
---
Commando is my preference - rifles are just too slow paced for me.
---
Yeah there’s a website where you can “plan your build” but I’m too dumb to use that so I just winged it and it worked out decently. Lots of perception, agility, and luck haha
---
I switched to commando with a bffr combat rifle. So much better. Vats crit and sneak help too.
---
I agree with your analysis, I've never stepped away from the game since the very beginning, and did some Raids when they first came out, but found them to be unrewarding resource hogs, I don't care anything about getting the special Armors that lag the servers when used, so I no longer do vault raids.
---
Yeah it’s just one of those things lol. What happened was I was trying to go to the pip boy and if you go to the stats tab you can press square for a radaway and X for a stimpack. Well apparently I was on my weapon and pressed square to drop it and X to confirm the drop. 
---
Pissed me off at the time but only temporarily. Nothing I can do to get that weapon back unless I do some trading or just hope I get the slim chance of finding something similar in the wasteland. 
---
The weapon I dropped was an AAFFR handmade (anti armor faster fire rate) which I had traded another weapon for it. Perfect weapon for my build but sucks I lost it lol
---
Great. Thanks for the help.
---
Agree.  That single perk card makes the difference.  Sure you can max out a nice heavy build without it but why give up that much accuracy and AA?
---
Word
---
I swap back and forth often. Rifleman when you want to conserve ammo and see bigger numbers. Commando for everything else.
---
yes took a chassis to garrahan, read all terminals, had all components, and still no build option, pa station only gave me option for x01 prototype, and ultracite
---
See with power armor at least you can easily get that back. Finding my handmade in the wasteland again is slim to none XD
---
You're right. You must be not moving products because you're charging "chump change....."
---
I get that. You are thinking like the hot / cold metric works in 7 days? I meant beth would screw up the design that after like 5 minutes or some other random event, the snow turns to bullets or something equally stupid and have some sort of un-planned effect...
---
If we only 38 was the currency because I’ve got 600k of that (yes I’m serious and no I didn’t dupe it)
---
Hey there,
---
My recommendation whenever somebody wants build advice is to study all the perk cards and mutations, and weapon types and their affixes.  The outcome will give you far more than anyone telling you to do A,B,C.  Its actually really fun adjusting perks and seeing improvement. The result will end up being a setup that is perfectly suited to you.
---
Have fun!
---
Lol, i feel you there. I guess I'll just mix and match some stuff and see overall what works best. Thanks for the advice
---
The future may not include anything of the sort. 
---
I don't give handouts.
---
I don't like people...or give handouts. 
---
I know every plan and it wasn't cause I bought them/traded for them. I played the game. If there IS new plans coming, I will win them instead of using caps. Wrapping paper is all there is .. you sads cause you opened some cool shit and no one will give you anything for it? Wait til the event is over a week and then pull these plans out.. nothing is worth a DAMN thing til the event ends.
---
You need PA for a heavy build or you wouldn’t be maximizing the build.
---
I just got a friend back into it by just telling him how much I like it and why.  It was a slow process over a few weeks but it eventually worked, he reinstalled.  Then I twinked his low level toon out with bos heavy armor and a fixer/handmade set.  Games a lot more fun when you aren't getting curb stomped, ya know.
---
Also, tis the season, gift them copies for Christmas perhaps?
---
If i took over the ammo factory. It would also b free for all to take the 5.56 ammo
---
Hes charging 20 caps per scrip, 800 caps for a 3 star trash weapon. He wonders why people aren't buying his shit during an event that gives everyone a bunch of extra legendary items.
---
Yeah Bethesda make a nuclear winter an actual thing ;) if a nuke gets launched make it let the area get snowed on ;)
---
I’m not hurting for caps. I was broke for a few hours but made about 20k last night.  It’s not hard
---
I also compare fallout 76 to ESO, and 76 really needs something like a public dungeon or world bosses you can solo and a dungeon group finder.
---
What if you interact with Garrahan posters that usually launch the quest?
---
Chalk it up as a loss bro
---
I have a feeling this will be the start of another purge of duped weapons, probably including legacies. They're not gonna let this shit roll over into wastelanders. I hope.
---
Where do you get the current player base numbers?
---
np if you are on ps4 i can offer you to visit my camp and i help you out a little bit 👍🏼
---
Different game, but go Torgue!
---
Lol, love it!
---
I made 24 large ones this morning and got a total of just over 8000 caps from opening them all, you also get up to 50 scrip from some of them, and can get 500 caps from the medium ones.
---
Apparently I missed something about this hacking bullshit. Well, whatever, still think my comment is amusing and still personally loving the game so what do I  care about downvotes. Even if this post isn't a valid thing, some of the stuff in the actual game still does make me chuckle as I come across it.
---
I wish I had the means of giving this an award. You sir deserve that frying pan.
---
Do you notice if overall performance is improved, apart from things loading and rendering quicker? Like does it help with lag in any way? I'm not very savvy with the inner workings of computer hardware, so just curious. I thought maybe some of my lag problems was due to an old hard-drive and not all completely server side.
---
No they won’t. I also don’t think you know how wide spread this has gone. For the average wastelander trekking alone is probably uncorrupted. But I know multiple discord channels swapping this stuff around. So many duped items and every pattern in dev room only in the game now. People leaving this trash everywhere for people to pick up. Some have been doing it just to dirty the player pool. A decent portion with first memberships and paid atoms. The pool of players isn’t large enough to wipe out their income. I can’t claim to know how many play. But I play a lot and see many familiar faces every server im in. Aside from the weapons they know how to stay under the radar otherwise. I’ve seen some of these guys in groups you’d think your safe from.  Ask to create a weapon, armor or mod you know isn’t possible . People are learning stuff they probably don’t know they technically can’t.
---
Some guys did the math during the Mischief Nights event, and it showed that the number of players across all platforms was around 14k at the time. 
---
And Fallout 76 no longer appears in any Top 40 most played games either.
---
Agreed, &amp; I've made over 200 large ones
---
time trials suck. infinite mobs suck. lazy design.
---
I've seen people do this a lot.  You can buy what you want from the right player.
---
I logged into anthem today. Its new content still cannot interested me like how 76 did. However damn the snowy winter looks gorgeous. Just unbelievable gorgeous, feels like the landscape is completely changed.
---
There is still glitches in this game? LMAO
---
I feel like I'm in the minority on this but I prefer rifleman. I have an executioner's fixer and aae handmade. Definitely feel more like a killing machine with commando, but with a few point in adrenaline, things start falling fast enough once the first couple go down. Plus, I don't play enough to want to farm for ammo all the time (I know, I know, Lucky Hole Mine, etc.). It's a personal preference thing though. I have always used semi-auto in Fallout games.
---
Im on xbox
---
Before I joined Reddit i took workshops regularly. Out of 50+  workshops I only had someone contest it 3x. (8x if you count the guy who tried and died five times in a row trying to take Poseidon from me). I joined Reddit (where I heard all the horror stories about workshop griefers) about the same time they ended survival mode and since then I use the standard sneaky guerrilla tactics to take workshops when I want them. TBH though, if I need a resource that's at a workshop I take it on my private server because I'd rather just avoid the drama all together.
---
I think the best thing would to buy a bunch of wrapping paper and then once the event is over make presents and sell them
---
Clearly made by torgue.
---
EXPLOSIOOOOOOONSSS!!!!!!
---
There's definitely not enough make-shift armor.
---
I run a bloodied/unyielding VATS rifleman second character. With all 3 rifle perks, bloody mess and adrenaline I can one shot most enemies with a bloodied/FFR hunting rifle or bloodied/FFR gauss. Use serendipity and nerd rage to boost your survivability below 20% health and four leaf clover and better critcals to melt tough enemies like scorchbeasts with vats criticals
---
Thx, interesting. To each his own I guess. I'll be sticking with fo76 for a long time as long as I'm not the only one left...lol.  it actually saves money, at least for me since I'm not buying new games that last 1-2weeks with no replayability.
---
I had three armor pieces break within 10 mins of each other during PvP last night. This was at 200% as well. After repairing, pieces broke even faster.
---
I've spent more than 100K on wrapping paper, and have yet to see more than 500 from a medium sized gift, but do frequently get 1K from large ones.
---
The players are why I stick around and deal with the bugs. Welcome!
---
I could never destroy the balloons I built. I'll have to check again.
---
If they were doing these things intentionally I'd tip my hat to their creativity. They just keep find new and innovative ways to fuck everything up!
---
Man, I have an Instigating/PA damage buzz blade that used to be awesome. Cut through the Whitespring ghouls like butter and could one-shot max level super mutants with a power attack. Good times.
---
There should be 3 tiers: no build, build/limited destroy (current), and full permission. I'd like to collaborate with friends on stuff, but it's really cumbersome to have to ask the owner to come destroy something that's in you're way.
---
True, true.
---
I've spent more than 100K on wrapping paper, and have yet to see more than 50, and scrip only comes from Large sized gifts.
---
I was just hoping this would be released at the end.  It has to be a crazy amount.
---
Hope they can do this annually during other festivities. For example upcoming new year, Chinese New Year, April Fool and more! That will be so great
---
People are already selling plans, but I agree with you.  I'm waiting for the event to end....hail RNG gods for making my snallygaster mount worth a fortune. Who knows.
---
Melee weapons on Destiny need ammo! Lol
---
All jokes aside, I'm glad I don't play on pc, I've been seeing alot of these posts and ps4 has enough problems....still love the game tho.
---
Lmao worse, people created a program that you can spawn any kind of weapon, and swell as anything that's in the game files into your world
---
I haven't bought one lol
---
I am on
---
Buy some good beer or weed, invite them over, make them watch you play.
---
Maybe they don't want to support this trash and they aren't wrong.
---
A lot of people have been claiming to spend 10s and 100s of thousands. This post is mostly directed toward them.
---
I'd buy it
---
I never claimed they would.
---
Mothman is the one people keep asking me about. I have 1 extra after 200 or so presents. Still sitting on another 150 right now. Hoping for the plasma grenade plans and still missing one mount.. the radfrog.
---
Welcome - And added :D
---
Thank god, finally some one agrees that we should have changing weather!
---
Why so?
---
I only run one character but I've easily spent 20k.  Cannot imagine how much the serious guys are dropping with 5 toons on 5 accounts.
---
Stabilized in intelligence is crucial for a heavy build.
---
There are certain players with good reputation - couriers, middleman's, faction representatives - they won't scam to you because that would fuck their brand up.
---
Eat some brain fungus soup too!!
---
Back when I was desperately scrambling to get some pocketed armor before it was patched.
---
Back when I was trying and failing to reach level 22 so I could disarm traps, for the infinite XP glitch. I really didn’t know how to play the game.
---
Oh, yeah i am on PS4. My psn is EkoLion. I'll be on after work if you're around.
---
You can't expect anyone here to be able to make that distinction.
---
Camp budget doesnt go by levels, what yiu see is what you get lol
---
I'm interested, and I'm okay with paying first so at no point you'll be prone to be scammed.
---
What build do you use? What weapons and armor would you be interested in?
---
Remind me why you’re on this subreddit again?
---
Vats sneak rifleman is devastating in my experience. I use an instigating lever rifle and one shot just about everything other than the real big baddies. For those I use a two shot primed gauss rifle and not much stands up to that for very long, and it certainly has plenty of dps for the queen.
---
Speed demon? Yeah, I fucking hate that class freak doesn’t change it.
---
It should’ve been an fing priority. 
---
It’s basically game breaking if your broke, or over encumbered.
---
I think I have several radfrogs..need to check...if so, I'll give you one if you're on ps4, but if you have 150 presents to open you'll get one ;)
---
What platform you on?
---
Agree on using private server for resources... but i want a public server to share the joy of the game as I have been gifting my low level legendaries to newbies when they exited vault76.
---
I thought i scrapped my level 1 2* board. Turns out it was in my higher level account. Gonna b santa tomorrow n gift it away to a low level. See who is the lucky dweller
---
That would actually be a really cool enemy, a mutated scorched, perhaps?
---
Or, increase the legendary spawn rate to match what is in game now. I think the logic of throttling the drop rate to make us play more is bunk. I am playing more now since I have a greater chance of encountering a legendary. Sure its mostly one star scrip, but I am finding myself playing at least 50 percent more due to the increased spawn rates.
---
99% of the beth pelase threads don't get added :( I'm willing to take -11 bullets for telling the cold hard truth my man; I'm ready to be a martyr... please make sure they remember me
---
How does a game kill the drives?
---
Not to mention that it snows like hell up there irl
---
Will add you in about 20 minutes, I’m level 52 right now.
---
Is that title a Nick Valentine quote?
---
wait couple o months for Fallout First's inevitable budget addition my man
---
Wait, could scorched not be legendary before this?
---
To get a laugh at people still supporting Bethesda's bullshit.
---
Yup. Random deaths galore, when normally I haven't had to worry nearly as much. But now I'm chugging rad aways and stimpacks like never before... So much, that I've removed some perks to replace them with Med Perks to help this new burden.
---
There was some sort of feud between the mods.
---
Spider Scortched
---
I’m doing rifle man on my first character.  I’m going to try commando on my second. 
---
I was using random junk weapons and crappy semi autos for my first 35 levels.  I found a semi-auto handmade and it’s a whole new game.
---
When I level my 2nd character I’m going to build it around an auto build.
---
After that I’ll probably make a third character focused around a wacky weapons I’ve found.
---
I find the opposite, i find being handed end game gear strait up just takes the fun away from the game, my favourite time playing was during the beta when high level players didnt exist to interfere and to take on a scorchbeast you and like 6 other randoms had to team up with your pipe weapons to kill it.  
---
Being in areas you and your friends are woefully ill prepared to be in like the warzone that was watoga in the beta was amazing, since you surviving meant you out ran your friends, where you had to share ammo cus there just wasnt enough, when 1 of you had to uograde all the weapons in your team because you the only one with the perks to do it...
---
I mean at that rate they can make it show the nuclear winter mode
---
Thanks. Curious how you know this though?
---
Funny you mention that, I think he does say it at some point! 
---
But it's originally used in the play Hamlet from Shakespeare.
---
Any tips on how to max it out without that card?
---
I hate to say it, but as a FO1 member, I hope this isn’t /s.
---
PC here - using an SSD is the best thing you can do for this game outside of a total hardware upgrade. 
---
You also need to have your main OS drive on an SSD so it doesn’t cache to a HDD and start frame hitching.
---
Same... I see no reason to buy one lol.
---
PC here, dang. I am hoping to meet some PC present farmers that want to do an exchange. You got one though?! This is good news. I will get it before the events end for sure! Thanks for the info and good luck.
---
PC but went from constant frame drops to minor if none
---
I just started playing again.  At launch I remember being able to build more as I leveled.  Has something changed?
---
What is better than 1 overpowered weapon. 10 more 🤣
---
Lol It's not legendary gear bro.  Its grey level 20 craftable stuff.  Things he could craft himself if he had the plans.  Just giving him a leg up lol
---
depends, i live in germany and im gonna he online for the next few hours 
---
shoot me a message on reddit when you get online so i can switch to my crafting character before we meet 👍🏼
---
Hey, thanks for your response. Sounds like a good investment, although I'm on PS4, but I assume it wont make it worse.
---
Is there a fix for this? They can just remove all 4 or more starred weapons, right ? I am not playing anymore if this is allowed to stay.
---
U2!
---
Im not saying its wrong, im just saying i personally prefer to not have stuff given to me when new to a game
---
I did. I hated the shit out of it. Mindless virtue signaling. No place for it in a video game. That's some Feminist Frequency bullshit.
---
My suggestion. If you are planning on going commando you're going to have to wash your pants more often.
---
Not a building tip per say but I visit lots of camps and find ideas to inspire me. I hate building but when something strikes me, I get encouragement to rebuild
---
It will make things speedier across the boats. It’s not a silver bullet for all things but it really helps.
---
It was one of the things mentioned to come with FO1st, back when it first came out.
---
Sack hood and drifter outfit or engineer outfit. 
---
When I do get the wonderfully rare RP moments, my characters are a fully-covered ghoul trying to stay bundled up so the smoothers don’t get freaked out. 
---
Til I talk and sound like I smoke 3 packs per hour. 
---
Come visit The Bag-man sometime!
---
Looks like the boss at the end of one of the old mortal kombat can't remember name
---
I think at this time, the raid changes. Give it an hour or so
---
The vault mission changes over every Tuesday morning and remains unopened for a few hours while that change over takes place. You just hit it at the wrong time, try back later.
---
Thank you sir. That does help.
---
In the past they didn't ban players who bought modded items.
---
No worries man nicely put. My perspective is this patched up engine is awful at this point and game should be retired after Q4 2021 by going F2P and having 7-8 (they already have 4) events on repeat for some years after that, as it will serve its purpose after that point as a financial year filler so even most of Austin can work on proper projects.
---
No matter what they do, no matter which quests they add, essential places like Watoga has been sub20 fps from day one, and they can't change it via patches.
---
You have no idea how many T51b parts I've scrapped by accident :P
---
Now, my bloodied FFR 5mm Gatling on the other hand, I was a bit bitter about having dropped by accident :/
---
I put an AAE handmade (2\*) in my vendor for 25k and it sold the same day.
---
It's OK'ish atm.
---
You can build some pretty great camps if you don't use turrets and other budget sinks.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Only legacy bats are explosive
---
We have everything in common with every other online gaming community in existence. We have nice people, and we have assholes. There really isn't anything different here
---
Wish we could lock items so it isn’t even an option. I know it asks to verify first, but what if I’m double stupid that day?
---
How about a hud that shows chem duration or defensive perk cards being active so you can see if you forgot to take super duper off and put serendipity on instead.
---
If its a atom shop skin a popup will warn you dropping will destroy it the same with other atom cosmetics.
---
I definitely agree with that idea!! Because last night was one of those me being double stupid, and having the option to lock an item you don’t want to drop out your inv would be such a QoL.
---
You can buy every reward for less than 25k. I don't get why they'd spend that much.
---
Should of charged for santatron given emotes for free. Something like that. Why would I spend that to use them for 2 weeks lol
---
I’m sure they would’ve if their game wasn’t already an ass hair away from falling apart lol
---
*POST GETS DELETED*
---
Negative, there are thousands and thousands of people playing this game and you can play with all of them by switching world instances. This is no difference in functionality than guild wars or any other layering system employed by other mmorpgs.
---
Idk lol, i came a little after launch and its been the same for me since i started...have 1800 into it and always had the same budget. Maybe as you level up you figure out tricks to make it seem like you have more budget? Turrets, lights, displays, and crops take up the most budget
---
The Bog. So many locations without scrap benches. End up huffin' it back to Watoga to scrap.
---
This comment has more charisma than anything 🤣
---
I wish the budgets were bigger. It feels like we're having to build smaller &amp; smaller &amp; simpler camps to have enough budget to decorate it with all the cool little things we get in the Atom shop. I hating having to pick &amp; choose what does &amp; doesn't make the cut.
---
It’s pretty dumb that if you spend atoms you risk destroying your gear forever, extra prompts or not. I almost don’t want to ever put skins on.
---
Let me put it this way, even tho I pre ordered this game, and was my first pre order.
---
Over a year later, I still enjoy it.
---
Yeah there are annoying things.. yeah glitchy and shit. But I still enjoy it.
---
ps4
---
Leave the past in the past, brother.
---
This is how I generate ideas. I like to THINK I’m creative, and then I go to another camp and am immediately amazed at the wacky/cool stuff some come up with.
---
I ran into a Log Cabin Hunting Lodge last week, so I made my own last night.
---
One recommendation I’d say is to pick a theme and roll with it. My best created camps have all been themed ones.
---
Yea why buy 20 of them to get 1 plan I want when I can wait for someone to post it for 5k :/
---
will not start since already did it
---
seriously...
---
Let them be hit, then. When you're buying cheap, multiple star item from vending machine, you are no longer "innocent".
---
Yes I know lol, but when you go on the stats part of your pip boy where is shows all your limbs, on PS4 if you press square you can take a radaway and press X to take a stimpack. Well I was on my weapons page apparently and I pressed square to drop the weapon and X to confirm this drop, but I did it very rapidly without thinking. because usually if I want to get rid of my rads I’ll just go to my pipboy and take a radaway and stim at the same time so I press Square and X pretty quickly and that’s what happened when I was on my gun. 
---
Sorry if that’s hard to follow but that’s the best I can explain what happened XD
---
I keep getting the 1k caps in those and getting back the caps I spent easily.
---
I use a Gatling gun or a Gatling laser with power user I don’t prime anymore due to the lack of people launching nukes. Both are good for casual
---
200k
---
Megumin can use explosion 15% faster with this!
---
We have no indication that they plan on doing anything.
---
The harshest thing they have done is make these people write an essay....
---
If your doing heavy guns and non power armor just use automatic rifles instead
---
idk man its pretty fun
---
then again i only use it on my private server
---
U go over there to activate it yourself, it’s a permanent event and location
---
Well one guy suggested a lock option to lock items in your inventory and not not be able to drop them. I personally think that’d be a better idea, but definitely after last night it was a huge lesson learn lol
---
I’ve been buying them left and right, making presents and saving them till after the event so I can mark them up and sell them.
---
As of last night I've dropped about 60K on them, on my one character.
---
I’m a big C.A.M.P builder. Probably more than I’d like to admit. I move often and rebuild often. 
---
I think the first key to building is being happy with your location. Do you want to be on an extractor? A good fast travel location? Scenic view? Near a train station/vendor?
---
After you have an idea of what you’re looking for from a location, I recommend keeping the building itself small-medium size... maybe 4x3 foundation plus a small deck. I used to build larger structures but would always find them to look overly huge and I would typically run out of budget space to decorate and give the interior/exterior some character. 
---
I think that’s a good place to start!
---
For real, not everyone we team with is trusted that much. Improved social tools are a must.
---
Thinking about doing this and saving 3 points in strength for heavy guns so i can use my cryolator and gat plasma on the queen
---
Thats what happens when a single player game dev makes an online game without consulting ANYONE with experience.
---
Pedro is a buen amigo.
---
I know you are, but Pastafarians are an actual religion. Sure they're tongue in cheek, but they exist in the real world, and use the same laws that other religious groups do. I, at least, don't want any of that real world bullshit invading the game. The fucking rainbow bullshit was bad enough.
---
Yup.
---
Muy buen amigo, incluso.
---
My Friend Sancho
---
To be faaaiiiirrrrrrrrrr...my chest armor is still breaking very slowly. Everything else seems to be made of paper
---
Try to reach the support then but I doubt they'll accept to do anything. I had a similar issue with the BOS quest line, a random guy in my group did it and it completed it for me as well (bug), then I was unable to use anything that needed you to register yourself while doing the quest. No recon  rifle for me :( and the support wasnt willing to do anything.
---
cool story, terrible advice. well, you tried
---
If I was influenced by player counts and reviews, I wouldn't play Fallout 76.
---
Vote for Pedro!
---
I second your opinion OP in 20 years of online gaming this is the worst I have seen hacking getting without even an acknowledgement from the company.
---
It is absolutely disgusting that it has been allowed to get this bad.
---
The community is to blame as well for encouraging this crud.
---
Well it IS Bethesda...so yea seems legit.
---
Plasma granade plan is that expensive?
---
It's gone man. Until they give us a lock feature this will always be a problem.
---
Well, it's up the developer company to turn those player counts and reviews into something positive.
---
I've had this happen to me. It's nothing to do with stash space. I've found I need to leave the server and join another one when this happens. No matter what you take out of the stash you won't be able to deposit anything on that server
---
Back in the day we use to farm whitesprints.. let the low levels hit the target and then spray them with our shotguns.
---
But my friend Pedro actually works and isn't a wet dream cash grab
---
There hasn’t been any response from Bethesda on these hacked weapons
---
I feel the same, Last night I got a little frustrated as i was over encumbered, armour broken, almost out of 5.56 for my handmade and I came across 5 level 64 Ghouls, then a scourchbeast decided to join in.
---
They don't have ammo to double, they don't have bullets to explode, and they don't have anything you need to reload...
---
Ouch
---
Interesting...
---
Any idea what's in this small patch?
---
It’s not 4 star, these are all legitimate effects that don’t apply to the baseball bat. They cannot remove a lot of these hacked weapons without complications.
---
That's not entirely true. They definitely received consulting from the microtransactions and monetization teams involved in other online games.
---
The sad thing is, they HAD someone with experience. ESO exists. They just had to ask.
---
I think they just didn't give a shit.
---
Lol point taken
---
Its 384MB on XBOX btw.
---
That's one of my issues, keeping it small. When I tried to build a tree house, it ended up being more like 6x6 or so, and then I couldn't help myself but built one in the next tree and connected them with a bridge.
---
Looked ugly, had no roofs and ran out of camp budget. So ended up deleting everything.
---
I just found that. Was curious also about what was updated
---
Absolutely. Watching the lessons ESO learned being relearned by a studio with the same publisher is just painful
---
That was a myth. It was just that turrets used to take up about 10% of budget and lights took up a lot too back then so some people were able to build a lot more if they didn't have turrets
---
Yeah lol from what people have been telling me it’s gone for good. Not really a big deal though. I could always just hope murmurgh will love me and give me a similar variant for what I had :D
---
Lol.  which was already fixed but hey at least you tried, right?
---
Nope :/
---
I built a decent base this weekend and have change to spare.   I have turrets, billboards, ect.  I’m more wondering what the potential is if I get really into it.  Judging by other bases I’m not too worried about it.
---
Okay...
---
I've got a Mothman mount, a gorilla head mount, three plasma grenades, a mirelurk king head mount, and one other rare mount that I've forgotten. I'll easily be back at max caps the first day after the event ends.
---
Me too
---
lol
---
Most likely for stability? Nothing known yet?
---
Still heard a few people reporting the issue.
---
A fix for the fix that fixes the fix they fixed
---
I see you've never played GTA online
---
 Small console patch for the big fix last week:
---
&gt;Hi everyone,  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;We are planning to roll out a small update for console versions of the game at **10:00 a.m. ET tomorrow, December 17**, that brings a follow-up improvement for the bug fix reversion we made on [Friday, December 13](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/376149/complete-fallout-76-maintenance-december-13-2019?language%5B%5D=en).  While the change we made on Friday resolved the main symptoms of the  armor/reload issue, this adjustment will address the issue more  completely. This was already done for PC during Friday’s maintenance and  now that we’ve determined it was successful, we are going to  update consoles to match PC.     
---
&gt;**We do not need any downtime in order to release this update for consoles**,  and the download size will be under 1GB. As mentioned above, PC players  will not need to download anything, as they already received this last  week.     
---
&gt;We will update this thread as soon as the download is available.   
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/376573/complete-small-update-for-consoles-december-17-2019/2?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/376573/complete-small-update-for-consoles-december-17-2019/2?language%5B%5D=en)
---
I've talked to the guy who made the spawning script, I talked to eck, I looked at the script, I've looked at the esm, I've read the forum post where the people using the script talk about what they're doing with it...every single one of those people has said it's impossible to do. It isn't possible with the limits of the game. That script is just a spawner, it can't edit the esm. Editing the esm is what would be needed for the game to register any star past 5. There's people making 5 star weapons and running around. Not 10 star. Be upset over the 5 stars being made, don't fall for the hype.
---
Is it fixed?
---
Thousands are playing CoD too. Guess it's an MMO.
---
Goro!
---
Armor degradation is making up for lost time then?
---
Haha yeah I give that advice only because I’ve struggled to do that since this game came out!
---
My most recent camp was the first time I kept it small and it’s probably my favorite camp I’ve built.
---
Not an open explorable world that is linked in even remotely the same way man.
---
Thanks
---
So it's not an RPG then.
---
Marsupial first time was awesome.
---
Need to get me a proper drive for the ps4. Do you have a normal or PRO?
---
Best reply award!! :)
---
Yeah, the raid is kinda garbage and the only reason I want to do it is for the power armor and even then I gotta do it more just for the vault 94 steel
---
Damn, the proto-scorched.
---
That's why you don't mod precious weapons. We are quite dumb, because our fingers are used to the click click click and we sell things we don't my want to sell, buy stuff we don't want to buy and scrap and drop nice shit. 
---
I know because I scrapped many beautiful rare outfits which were in my inventory among some very scrappable armor.
---
Ah, so they adjusted turrets budget costs.
---
Unusual to have zero info. The patch seems to small, however, to fix anything broken in the last patch
---
Well they first have to unfix half the fixes to figure out what fix to fix and then fix it again.
---
Hopefully a fix for all the dailies that stopped giving any rewards
---
It’s not hacked it is probably glitched. I had an armor pice with vampires and faster fire rate but next time I fast traveled it won’t back to the normal legendary effects.
---
I seem to alternate between:
---
\- Hunters Coat, Elmer Fudd hat with flaps up, prison collar and bottle cap shades, Shovel backpack
---
\- Padded Blue Coat, Fasnacht Beret, Prison Color
---
\- Whitesprings Jump Suit, Mr. Fuzzy Mining Helmet
---
\- Fire Fighter (Halloween one), Gasmask/Helmet, Skull Bandana
---
Tbh if you need an essay to pitch a game than its not worth playing
---
They still have rewards for me, they jist never popped up on screen. I defo gott scrip for doing them anyway
---
Cool?
---
It seems like every patch they release messes with food and water consumption. It's one of the first things I always notice
---
Same. I also find one on the backside of Top of the World (walking down towards that encampment to the east) quite a bit as well.
---
u r killing me.  i would of gave you 25k plus stuff.  hahah
---
The 10 star weapon has been already proven fake, as shown in:  [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/376558/no-the-10-star-legendary-is-not-real?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/376558/no-the-10-star-legendary-is-not-real?language%5B%5D=en)
---
&gt; But to allow players to directly influence the game with simple scripts? Damn, that's a mistake I would expect from an indie, unexperienced company, not from fucking billionaire Bethesda.
---
Well it's the same with GTA V.
---
And the rewards... Well...
---
I have to exit out of VATs to "reset" it and it works again. I noticed it wouldnt hit enimies even at point blank range.
---
Hope it isn't a big fix, I need my daily fix.
---
Okay you got me there. It isn't an mmorpg. Remember, mmo is shorthand for mmorpg traditionally.
---
But is is a massively multiplayer onlinge game.
---
I see it like it I want it I can’t get it because I am a console peasant
---
Did you even look at the effects? It is literally nonlegendary none of the effects work on melee items, double ammo capacity, explosive bullets and 15% faster reload. That bat is about as legendary as a drill.
---
That bat is nothing but a joke weapon, and it isn't like it matters if it was OP as this sub has clearly stated every time that there is no way to gain an advantage in this game as there is no competition between players in adventure
---
The Stockholm's Syndrome is free as well.
---
I'm confused....So they broke , the broken thing they broke and now they fix it with another broken fix ....
---
I'm selling the plans. Why would anyone buy the gifts?
---
It feels like this could be the case: came to say the same. Most precious legendaries to me are the ones with reduced weight. I have no problem selling godroll weapons, but I will never sell my reduced weight firearms.
---
Beth threw PC players to the wolfs to make sure to not mess with the console players.
---
I feel entitled.
---
For a niche game? Of course you need a essay.
---
For the every day game you really don't need think about.
---
This is actually hilarious. How much is it selling for?
---
Every single one.
---
Of course I looked. I also saw that 10-star Handmade. Would you say that is a joke, too? Or do you have appropriated such weapons yourself..?
---
And there is a competition in adventure, it's called PvP; scripted weapons like these will obviously give you an unfair edge.
---
Water and hunger are going down faster and most enemies now have a sixth sense as to where a player is. It's almost as if they're trying their best to make the game a pain in the rear.
---
I have about 800 hours into the game, and the vast majority of that is on my Vats Crit Rifle Build, I can say fro certain I have experienced this issue since day one.. I will notice it predominantly on my Lever action rifle where I will miss a full 5 round mag at close range it %95 and sometime I reload and shoot more..
---
This issue definitely seems to have been a thing from the start, at least for me.. however I’ve always dismissed the issue as down to either server latency or just the down right chance of it🤷‍♂️ I have also touched a fix, if you come out of vats and then re vats the target, you may lose you extra accuracy gained from your vats streak, but for me it seems to fix the issue! :)
---
Hmmmmm fo76 as a niche game🤔 not gonna lie this is the best defense I've seen for this game and it totally works - nice man!
---
Must be, because I'm laughing my ass of rn!
---
Yet you offer zero proof, just a "believe me". I already have given you links to tools that will tell you the 10star legendary photo hasn't been manipulated.
---
Still won't be better than a automatic rifle with tank killer
---
I bought it for about 500 or so, I was searching for scrip and saw this.
---
Thanks for reading!
---
Worth it.
---
I noticed this as well. Limbs I have repaired 3-4 times each over the weekend, but my chest is still over 100%.
---
It was a small update to consoles only. 
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/376573/complete-small-update-for-consoles-december-17-2019?language%5B%5D=en
---
No I found this early yesterday and it’s been like this all day.
---
Not sure how but when it happened I searched it up and apparently it's a common issue with people playing Fallout 76. now the game just starts to spin up and then doesn't read anything and it says unrecognized disc to any disc in there except for DVD movies. I've had the hard drive wiped I even put a new hard drive in that didn't help I reinstalled the operating system that didn't help. Next step is to replace the drive but I wanted a digital copy so I can just play it across all systems
---
On the PS4, it's such a huge difference you wouldn't want to go back to a spinning drive.
---
PvP has been removed in adventure for roughly 6 months when they removed slap damage.
---
HA! You expect too much of Bethesda.
---
Glad you posted this. I couldn’t find info about an update today anywhere. 
---
Also, why does this game copy the update sooooo slowly?
---
Nooo your misunderstanding.. they broke the think so they released a fix which broke the think that they want to fix so they released a fix that didn’t fix so this is that fix to fix the fix!
---
I suggest fully leveling up the Rifleman build, then put level ups into Commando.   For me, Rilfeman makes better use of limited ammo during early game but is rather slow moving. Commando requires more ammo but moves SO much faster.  At higher levels you'll have the resources to farm and make an abundance of ammo.
---
Fortunately, both builds require (basically) the same special stats.  So you can move back forth as you feel like it.
---
It's easy to recoup caps via the vendors unless you have a spending problem. I seem to always be around the 25,000 - 30,000 cap mark and it's been many months since I've had my vending machines at my camp. Even if you buy thousands of rcaps worth of stuff you should be able to recoup that in a few days.
---
If you stop shooting for a sec and then continue shooting while in vats, your shots should land on your target
---
Sell them while you can. Plasma grenade plans are already going for less than 10k. Santa crash and Icicles are going for less than 3k. The commons are sells for less than 200ea. The prices are dropping by the day.
---
Then they were repeating old information. The whole chunk of 250 code is gone. There's no accuracy to that. I can confirm strangler. still works now. No reload bug. 
---
That was an issue for about 72 hrs, lol.
---
Unobtainable for the time being
---
Trading in high end gear has become extremely difficult. You want to buy that junkies explosive handmade you see on facebook? You offer, say, 75k 556. An amount of ammo that took you quite a long time to farm. A next guy pops in, offers 100k ammo, a legacy weapon, and 3 god tier bloodied handmades. Items most likely god through duping. Now imagine these dupers can dupe 3 star lvl 1 guns and scrip 1,000 of them at a time because the cap is removed. They basically have the means to get whatever guns they want now through patience of just buying hundreds at a time. They can buy anything they want for whatever they want, and you poor shmuck who farms your own gear gets nothing.
---
They aren't available according to this [List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugsPWW8jLU_QWJJXolwy0dnY8k0J5gpqXWv1G_G5qKE/htmlview?usp=drive_web&amp;ouid=114061490874631881134&amp;sle=true)
---
I agree with you. I’ve played the game consistently and my play style has never changed. I’m an explorer/scavenger who occasionally farms the queen. I don’t use power armor. I’m used to every once in a while a piece breaks and when it does I go ahead and 200% repair all armor. I’ve never since I reached level 50 had to do that multiple times in a session until now at any point in playing this game
---
Goro vs. Sub Zero
---
back in the days (until this one) we just hadn't a stash limit. Back in 2018 we were told, the the servers couldn't handle the stress of more inventory management. Well we just learned, that that 13 bucks a month can fortunately releave some stress finally.
---
Yes it seems to be worse. Also, my heavy guns (LMG, Gatling) are more affected than my shotgun or lever.
---
I take it the 250 drwr still breaks primary legendary effect?
---
No unfortunately.
---
yeah thats great. And only 100 bucks a year. What a bargain!
---
If you say so. Plenty of people would disagree, though.
---
It's because it's going to "copy" after downloading and it uses the entire game file size. I have no idea why
---
Actually i gave 40 pieces away to lower levels, i actually always help lower level players out building armor and weapons for them when ever i can. All i simple asked was to lift or increase limits during events like this if they plan on putting gear and a present on them, its double what u would normally get. Maybe u should learn to actually read all the comments before u post stupid responses, just saying. Its people like urself that make posting anything not worth it and ruin a good community. Im going to stop now because honestly ur not worth the time in the day to respond. Take ur hate to another post please.
---
I know, but I'd bed money they've noticed, and are discussing what to do. They have the ability to remove items from the game and they have before, and that was for nuke colas and shit.
---
Todd Howard don't you call me 'cause I can't play
---
I owe my sole to atomic storeeeeeee
---
Ah then well probably a hacked item.
---
[http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/12/guide\_why\_does\_ps4\_copying\_update\_files\_take\_so\_long](http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/12/guide_why_does_ps4_copying_update_files_take_so_long)
---
Have you seen one in person or just the image?
---
That was for excessive amounts of stuff, everything about this item is legitimately other than the weapon the effects are on, I don’t believe they can detect it, and if the guy who was selling it had more, they can’t ban people for having them.
---
I dont feel it, but,but,but lets just say " yes i do" so my armor will last more 😄😄
---
Bro i need this so bad. Like ive been thinking of it since always
---
and on console. PC is a trap
---
Every time you freak out about a fake 10 star, you're causing Bethesda to be distracted from the real issue--the 5 stars. 
---
I'm one of the dataminers for this game. Legendary effects are classified by type, or which there are 5. If a 10 star is possible, then we'd see images of guns with 10 stocks, 10 scopes, etc.
---
If 10 star is possible, why are the exploiters stopping at 10? Why aren't they going all the way and adding every star?
---
I've made mods for Fallout 76, I've made mods Fallout 4, I've made mods for Skyrim. The only way to do something like this is to edit the esm, which 76 has locked down.
---
Tell me then, if these 10 stars are possible, why is there only one picture of them? Why are there multiple pictures of 5 stars and videos on 5 stars in use, yet only one for 10 star. Everyone referencing 10 star legendaries points back at this one image. Whereas, there's 5 star images floating around at an insane rate. 
---
By the way, I'm not offering up where the script came from. I've sent it along to Bethesda to look into. Sharing it here would be helping the exploiters.
---
Yeah I made it to 30k last night only to buy more wrapping paper
---
My experience is the same as the rest - if VATS misses, sometimes it gets "stuck" missing until you exit and re-enter it.
---
Not even an explosive swing? What a shame...
---
Nope. Ran a silo about two hours ago.
---
Just stopped by the sub to see how many people are still torturing themselves playing this “game”.
---
If you are you must seriously hate yourself lol..
---
Im lucky that my wife plays so i use her alt characters and she uses mine. That way my mule and my main can be in the same world. If u are a first memeber, im told u can drop ur stuff in a container, leave, change character to ur mule and go back into that world and ur stuff will still be in the container u left it in. I have not tried this. If ur on ps4 ur more than welcome to use my world to try it but if u do i would suggest leaving something that isn't worth anything incase it doesn't work.
---
That is what Austin was originally, mtx specialists.
---
No wonder... who plays Xbox?
---
As long as people keep paying they won't be putting in the effort. Fo1st showed them that people will pay regardless of the quality of content or number of bugs. They fuck up over and over again and people keep giving them cash, so why should they change? If they can change that is, the 250 DR and duping bugs have been in the game since the start as far as I am aware, and the attempts to fix it have been shambolic.
---
GTA Online is peer-to-peer based, it's much easier to cheat in this kind of multiplayer network. Games with client-server model usually have much better anti-cheat protection.
---
I really want to know how many Scorched were killed during this event.  It must be a crazy number.
---
Hahahaha! Yes! I remember excitedly telling everyone in my group that they didn't need to find an actual living Alpha Deathclaw when I discovered this. :)))
---
Turns out it's a prank:  [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/376558/no-the-10-star-legendary-is-not-real?page=1&amp;language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/376558/no-the-10-star-legendary-is-not-real?page=1&amp;language%5B%5D=en)   
---
My bad, deleted the post; don't wanna spread the panic.
---
Also be careful about containers you find in camps. My free weekend account had containers with every plan, weapon, junk, chem ingredient, armor recipes, and armor and people have come and taken from them. Risky risky ;)
---
I’m wondering if some more Christmas stuff will happen today (Tuesday).
---
Sooo many legendary robots. Phoenix was always busy.
---
Lol I took basically that same photo the other night
---
if you can play dvd, then nowt wrong with drive. possibly some thing like a cache on your hd. Havn't heard this one before, but 76 definatly messes with the controllers and  comms.
---
No there’s none.
---
I know. That's the reason I asked.
---
Please tell me you took another pic with your head in it’s place.
---
nobody at bethesda plays this game the whole raid feels like something thrown together by an intern in their lunch break
---
Depends why you looking for them and what for .. But the cabins just above white springs is pretty guaranteed, but you need to server hop .. that's the known location .. top of the world will spawn one, same deal, dependent on server and then they spawn at the dry lake in Toxic value and around toxic valley .. also just across from fort prickett is a small camp, I forget what it is called, if interested, I will look it up. But not aware of any spot, you will always go find a scorpion guaranteed. Cabins at white spring is the best spot.
---
&gt; lazy design
---
its the motto of the game since launch
---
everything is as lazy as it gets
---
Was the 5 one photoshop too? Asking fr not sarcastically, I’m not doubting that one after seeing alien blasters with 3 stars
---
That's a bummer man :/
---
I'm selling them for 250/500/750 to degenerate gamblers.
---
 All the negativity breeds negativity and turns people off.
---
I’m glad I came back and I’m not listening to the hate train anymore.
---
I'd like to see this too!  Would it break the game though? That's the thing we have to think about...
---
Dude deal with the 150 a day. This games economy is already fucked. Plus I'm calling bs on you. Even if you have found 3 star weapons during this event, you're claiming on top of the 40 pieces you gave away you would have gotten roughly 90 3 star weapons? And if it's a mix of 1, 2, and 3 star armor and weapons like most people are getting from this event its hundreds of items? No.
---
because you can pay less for the present and have a chance to get the plan. Gambling has a long and profitable history.....for the House.
---
Guess we'll find out in about an hour!
---
They tested the subscription taking our money early pretty well. Works flawless
---
I ran into this issue, you can walk up to the cores and press X to destroy
---
The 5 star ones are more than likely not, the only reason why the 10 star version was created was to f*ck with script kiddies and youtubers
---
I’ve waited days and nothing. Ive relinked my accounts and nothing showing. Did you have to claim it from the Atom shop?
---
It would cost more per year for me in electricity managing all the junk between 10 characters on 2 PS4s so yes I would Agree  consider this hard bargain 3! Oh my!
---
Is it a gag? Bug maybe?
---
So as fun as this has been im blocking u, u contributed really nothing to this conversation...thanks for playing
---
You're right, the cheating is rampant there but it's Rockstar's fault that they decided to use peer-to peer networking (which is much easier to exploit) beacause it's cheaper than hosting or renting dedicated servers.
---
Yep, they have always been there
---
I was thinking of getting one. Does the storage size of the SSD make a difference with speed?
---
LMAO I have not played this game in maybe 6 months but wow...When I left, everyone was duping from the Modex (Modus, whatever it is called).
---
I wonder if I still have all of the shit people gave me LMAO
---
Be nice if it would just remove the skin, that would make so much more sense.
---
How do you see the player counts?
---
Do I think I'll be good to start the game when that update comes out? The game Is just too boring rn lol
---
Dude having one guy run around like god in NW is on bethesda. He was in a hundred matches and at no point did they do anything about it. So many people reported him and used video evidence. Put it all over social media and they had NO ONE to police it. They don’t even have one guy working in game to admin it. Just hire one guy with some sort of admin invisible privilege to ban blatant hackers. He can go around in game checking for active duping. Hell maybe even go to private games incognito. Just one guy doing this would cull a huge portion of the cheating. If not that at least some temp during events because all the scum comes out in droves during that time.  The only reason I can imagine they don’t is that they’d loose too much income from the ban.
---
This is the only one that I saw in the mined images. Little dissapointed, as I wanted more "festive" colors.
---
I think you're referring to Gunsmith. The one that reduces weapon breakage.
---
No - it just sorta magically showed up. 
---
Check in game to see if you can craft the white suit (clothing in Armor station). That’s how I figured out I got the items; there was no other notification.
---
Commando, you can still tap of single/Burst to conserve ammo and with good perks still one/two shot most mobs.  When shit hits the fan you can then let er rip.
---
I love how they left a link to where the find scripts so now even more people try them out lmao
---
Oh right I’ve been checking Atom shop. I will look Thanks.
---
I see it on the Top 40 most played games on Xbox, a list from which F76 disappeared shortly after launch.
---
Ikr!?
---
Hahah what the fuck is Bethesda going to do about this? I don't want to return to this game anymore now.
---
I think so, someone told me the last patch messed it up. I am getting the rewards I saw tho, mostly the Mr Fuzzy tokens, I know I'm getting those, I just don't know about other random stuff.
---
It's randomly annoying lol
---
Sweet! I hate it how long it takes to reload my bat. Hope to get this drop!
---
And people buy them?
---
Also does anyone else have this issue? And is there a way around this besides leaving for awhile and coming back?
---
I'm getting horrible flashbacks to The Forest now...
---
That build is shit dude
---
Yes. It was an old issue that seems (to me) to be reintroduced, or at least worsened during the last patch.
---
I did, I logged out fully restarted and relogged in to it, no change
---
Visit a friend with a Private Server?
---
Yes good idea
---
Honestly man, its a great idea. But ihave so little faith in bethesda being able to re texture the whole game just about just for a christmas event. That im pretty sure they would make us pay for. So... this probably wont ever happen. Still a good idea.
---
Sounds like an upcoming Atomic Shop item 👀😪
---
I'm currently situated in this humble abode:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCZ9toQZTV8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCZ9toQZTV8)
---
I spend a fair deal of time building ;-)
---
I still haven't played it yet
---
Just the other day it was the first time my power armor took significant damage during fight.
---
This is a PS4 issue. Also... buy an external hard drive
---
How do you change it? There was no options in his little computer.
---
I'd be doing the same thing. There's a chance there's an OnHit event that launches bullets. Could you imagine smacking someone with a bat and an explosion going off?
---
Good to hear! I get a huge rush planning bases when I find a cool spot. Am I lame?
---
It feels like this issue has gotten worse lately.
---
The rug glitch can be essential to creative placement. If you don't know it, the basics are to place a rug (any rug will work, but I usually use one that kind of looks like a shower mat for its smaller footprint) then place your other item so that at least part of it is on top of the rug. Then, when you select the rug, it should move both the rug AND whatever you placed on top of it (dresser, display cabinet, table, whatever you want). 
---
Trick is, the build interface then uses the rug's placement footprint to determine where you can place both items, so you can clip your other item into places it shouldn't technically fit, as long as the rug can fit there. You can then remove the rug if it doesn't fit your aesthetic, but this has some issues. 60% of the time, it works all of the time. I generally design my spaces to incorporate the rug into the look, because it can get glitchy when you take just the rug away, but sometimes it just goes away without a fight, YMMV.
---
Using this, I've done all kinds of space saving and interesting layouts, like overlapping display cases to make it look like one reeaaalllly long case, used the fancy metal shelf with the curved glass as a weapon display cabinet by clipping it into the wall in front of wall displays, and lined up all crafting benches so they slightly overlap to create what I like to call the "Mega-Bench"
---
If you select junk or materials first, when you go back to switch it again it’ll have the third (new) option.
---
Right?! I feel like I’m being tossed around in only a couple of servers now
---
Remember the [Atlas hack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDOkVtKhEJo)? Good times.
---
So they  released a coldfix but it should have been a hotfix ??? Aaah , everybody makes mistakes .... Now I understand .... Happy holidays
---
How to craft?
---
This is why I stopped Borderlands 1 multiplayer.
---
I tried! Didn’t look as good as I hoped it would.
---
Best spot I've found is the small raider camp just north of Fort Prickett. 90% of the time there are 2-3 there.
---
It definitely does snow in w Virginia !
---
when i find myself being “sent back” to the previous server i go into the Atom shop for a couple minutes then load into a world. no idea if this actually does something but it seems to help me.
---
Very nice.  My weekend build has some decorations but it’s pretty basic.  I built it a few steps from the first vendor you need to talk to when starting fresh.  I have food, drink, ammo and heals for cheap if new players stop in.  (Feels weird when lvl 300s buy it)
---
I want to scout more locations before doing a serious build.
---
Yeah that's what I have had to do for a while
---
best answer. Radscorpions do not have any static spawns.
---
I have a bug where whenever I fast travel or leave a interior a supply box drops. It never has anything in it so it must be the same one. I have videos of jt
---
Try launching directly from the exe.
---
Drink fresh wine
---
"FRESH WINE IS CALLED JUICE BETHESDA. IT'S JUST GRAPE JUICE!"
---
Another Bethesda innuendo
---
Thanks. Not sure I had seen anything about it in the update and no mention of it anywhere
---
if you miss 3 in a row then exit VATS and immediately re-enter VATS and you should be back to hitting.
---
I was kinda hoping it was just the server I was on but it appears it could be more common
---
It's been in the workshop menu since they added the brewing stations to the game. I don't think they would have an atomic shop item sitting that long with out it being available.
---
That would be pretty epic.
---
Imaging: a rocket sledge with explosive impact, deals damage to the wielder as well as the target. Could be a fun way to do a bloodied build.
---
This also happens to me sometimes. Stupid Bethesda sends me to the same server multiple times! It is very annoying. When I'm going to do server hop it's the same thing. When I come back I realize that I went back to the same server. 😔
---
Many players like to build these palaces which can be cool. But for me I go deep out into the woods or on the edge of a mountain cliff and build a simple small camp that meets all needs. And I make sure it looks like if I actually set up a camp in the wilderness. Basic necessities water, food, generator, workbenches, tent/bed, fire pit/banjo, and vendor. I usually also do some type of picnic area and an outhouse
---
That seems more like a problem with the game having dupes than any regular game play issue.  I know you have to take those things into account, but if people can rampantly cheat like that the economy is essentially permanently borked anyway.
---
Sometimes when you take the hemlock workshop it gets overrun with waves or scorpions, and campfire tales event always has 1 or 2
---
It's been mentioned before, but you can still use the rug glitch to run wires through anything you want and make stuff look a lot cleaner. 
---
Step 1: Place small rug or floor mat on the ground with a clean line of sight to the generator. 
---
Step 2: Place a power connector on the rug and connect it to the generator.
---
Step 3: Move the rug a couple inches and place it again so that the wire remains valid. This somehow "locks in" the wire and prevents it from disconnecting during the next step.
---
Step 4: Move the rug wherever you want. The wire will now run through walls, the ground, and any other environmental objects. The only restriction is the length of the wire. 
---
I tend to use floor connectors placed as close to the corner of a room as possible and run the wires along the baseboards or vertically in the corner, and then put down decorations like potted plants or a shelving unit to hide the connectors. 
---
Related tip new builders don't seem to know about: power can be daisy chained from one object to another, so you don't have to connect each object directly to the generator. I see lots of noob camps that are a clusterfuck of wires because they'll have every single water purifier and vendor connected directly to the generator rather than connecting the generator to the first purifier, and then connecting the first to the second and so on. 
---
How to create an enclosed area without a foundation:
---
Step 1: Place a foundation block and attach a wall with a doorway to it. 
---
Step 2: scrap/store the foundation. 
---
Step 3: use the change menu to turn the doorway into a solid wall.
---
Step 4: snap a half wall to the bottom of the now hovering full wall. It should clip through the ground and give you a wall stuck directly in the ground with no foundation support. 
---
You can use this to create enclosed structures with access to the dirt so that you can have your crops and small purifiers protected from wandering mobs that want to destroy your crops.
---
My initial post said that works, " It will still launch if started from the Fallout76.exe and manually signed in "  it's the Broken Launcher that is my issue!
---
If its fir a daily challenge to kill them in savage divide, you cant go wrong with the cabins north of Whitesprings (they are just above Blackwater mine). There can be 3 that spawn at a time. You will need to server hop if it is another enemy, and also to get the final 2, but that's a good location for them.
---
Yes... pretty much it locks on the wrong point, but keeps doing the math with the right spot.
---
This happens at my camp at least once per week. It's caused by two enemies loading in, but getting stuck. You can shoot them but nothing happens.
---
I have an update on Xbox- maybe it just crashed because they’re pushing an update?
---
No.
---
Giant enemy spider, muhwawawsea
---
It's a small update
---
While they're at it, they can add a toggle for joining pvp when your party members start pvp. 
---
The other common party troll tactic.
---
MLB cheating players be like...
---
Power armor plus non bloody weapons, the bloody effect is for pussies and heavy gun users aren't pussy brother hh
---
You buy the wrapping paper from the robot vendors (like at the train stations) and then make it at a tinker's workbench.
---
There might not be a lot of alternate servers available depending on your location and time of day. This used to happen a lot in Survival once it started dying off. With only 2 open servers available, switching servers didn't change the fact that the same players with the same CAMPs were in either server.
---
Heck no, I have to, I found some pretty cool places too! Definitely don't know how to build tho haha
---
[Here you go; this is my Bloodied Gauss Rifle build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f315ff&amp;d=p02pd2pk2pl2pp2eh1lt2an2lk2ir2a12la2l12cr0ar2ao0a51a72l71lu0s11e00sb1&amp;w=ic4iq2pe2lm2a31es2&amp;m=2f3&amp;nw=&amp;n=Rifelz).
---
It one-shots pretty much anything except really bullet spongy mobs (mirelurk queens, sheepsquatches). Stealth Commando builds are reportedly even better, but this is what I like.
---
Well, *liked*, before all the hacking bullshit.
---
What is the going price for a moth man plan? It might make a chance at unlocking it with a gift worth it.
---
I've played since launch. On my 1st character i built like 5 places and the last place i was really really happy with BUT after coming back from a break, id have to server jump 5-6 times cause someone else built a camp there. It had a little water area with a small "cave" overlook thing, it was awesome.But i started a new character and found a nice spot and for the 1st week, no problems. But over this weekend it was really bad, jumping servers a lot again. 
---
(End "rant") 
---
But my new spot i have, I'm going for a " organic" look. I like to try to use the environment and make it look like something that actually could be found in the world. I do enjoy ppls. Treehouse maze homes or the glitched under the world shop i found the other day but i just didn't want my camp like that. I have it built under, over and around one of the many bridges in the game. I have 2 buildings on both sides of the bridge and then on the bridge is my little outpost and shop set up. 
---
But Like someone mentioned before, pick a theme and run with it. Not every house has to be a huge mansion to look nice. I find a lot of bigger house camps seem really empty or jyst cluttered with a bunch of random stuff. But yeah, just keep at it and hopefully you build your " forever camp" soon enough.
---
Friend, lol
---
no, because people that don’t have them may not understand what the emotes mean unless they are looking directly at your character. 
---
but they’re soooooooo cute tho
---
I have a few other videos on my youtube, maybe you can use them for some inspiration :)
---
A buy a lot from low levels, actually! Mainly ammo and the odd legendary if i need my scrip capped fast.
---
If nothing else, Grahm and Chally should be dressed up for the holidays.  Grahm with a santa hat, and Chally with Xmas lights and a couple of wreaths......
---
Well hit me up if you want company!
---
Yeah, I noticed this for the first time after last week's update. It's been a problem for my friends before though.
---
Did you really go into a trade with someone named  "failed 2 Ban Me" and expect them to be legit? Totally separate from the crash, which probably had more to do with the update, does that strike you as a person who is likely operating in good faith within the ToS? lol
---
Give it a month and a couple patch cycles tell me if you still feel this way. Bethesda will manage to demoralize you one way or another.
---
it’s that auto weapon glitch. you need to stop firing a little sooner and then the game will quickly catch up with the damage calculations and the enemies will die in a more timely fashion.
---
It's an update. I haven't neem able to log back in since 10:30 EST
---
And lights take up a lot of budget
---
The days when you could run into whitesprings and everything was level 7 and the unruly golfers still existed
---
Me too, and everyone is level 20ish. Also I did not get one uranium fever event last night, but as usual, path of enlightenment popped up every half hour
---
About a month ago I started the game and was befriended by a level 650 player. At level 5, I was carrying a pop gun literally, and got a 1 or 2 star reward. My total damage could barely hit 200, so what is the theory about the required amount to get a 3 star piece of gear?
---
Turrets went way down in budget, but you're now restricted to 8 of them. They also reduced the cost for lights, but added a restriction of 50 max light objects.
---
Update speed is dependent on your internet speed. Many of my friends report that updates for this game take hours to download, while it takes only a few minutes for me. The installation takes only a couple of minutes as well, but I use an SSD on my Xbox.
---
I noticed how it only accured w my auto tesla , i guess i should fly somewhre and get back to them i guess , damn im gonna miss that 3star 😅
---
How’s that?
---
fallout life will be easier if you pay for fallout 1st
---
Oh I seen that, figured it was for custom gifts. So it's like a recipe?
---
Yeah, but that takes a lot longer than the old method of blasting them with an explosive weapon and destroying the entire console in 2 shots.
---
all you need to do is let go of the trigger a little sooner. give it a shot. worst case scenario is you die and get back to playing in like 15 seconds.
---
Once you have a foundation built, spawn back to your camp a few time and have a friend spawn there ass well, build your vendors directly in the visible path of the spawn point if you are into selling
---
Well to be fair it's pretty consistent.
---
I see, will give it a try
---
Hahaha I didn't play that game but that is nuts.
---
Mr. House always wins.
---
Indeed best andwer.
---
see if you can find a player that has a Bloodied handmade but with lousy stats like vats hit chance and +P or something like that
---
It does take a lot longer, you're right. But until they fix it this is the only option to do a nuke unfortunately
---
Yup. I’ve chalked it up to hard mode.
---
This is probably the best answer beside the "none"
---
They did do something about it, several times. The problem is, these cheaters use disposable accounts and can just come right back in after being banned. You don't need a high level to win in NW.
---
Think about it this way. The top players on Xbox NW are just now reaching and passing level 300. If the cheaters on PC haven't been banned, they should be well over that level by now.
---
That’s normal it spawns there by default. Or in front of the building.
---
Hang on,,,,, the Brand Ambassadors are on the way, they will dismiss downplay blame and disregard all reports that indicate any problems with the game. Bethesda loves you and you love Bethesda
---
Here's a weird thing that happened to me in the past few days. A two star SB was attacking the main entry to Whitespring. I was using a 3-star Furious hunting rifle, and with the help of the robots, downed the beast. But she died and fell on the roof. No way to get the loot drop. Same dumb thing happens on Borderlands 3. Only way it seems to fix this problem is to have a postmaster like the one in Destiny 2. I doubt that such a practical fix will ever be implemented by Bethesda.
---
No it’s real, I bought it thinking it was funny and it’s stayed like that.
---
The problem isn't one guy in Nuclear Winter. There are teams of people participating in this nonsense in NW and people in adventure are way too complacent with duping and glitching.
---
The community absolutely has a part to play in this nonsense even though the lions share is on Bethesda.
---
Oh awesome, I’ll just wait for them to really show me the way
---
The best gift I've opened so far had icicle lights, a prime handmade receiver plan, a vintage nukashine, and 500 caps.
---
Lol true
---
In case it wasn't clear, i already know every of the most known places. What i look for is someone that maybe planted camp in the middle of nowhere and found an unmarked guaranteed spawn.
---
Both. Easy to swap out the perk cards.
---
What the hell. BETHESDA FIX THIS! Stupid hackers
---
Nuh uh.  PC is the master race.  I read it on the internets.  Gotta be true.
---
I see that you a fellow player of class and distinction
---
Nuke Grenades still work. They're even better than shooting out cores since the explosion goes through walls and obstacles.
---
There actually were explosive melee weapons in the BETA period. I've seen an Explosive Spear. But this one is likely a PC fake.
---
The infinite carry weight glitch was the most amazing thing ever and completely changed the game for me.  The day I had to scrap the hundreds of weapons and armors I was carrying around with me after they patched it was one of the darkest days of my life.
---
Anyone have any idea what the update was for?
---
The download speed is dependent upon internet speed, I agree. But, I am talking about the ‘copying file’ speed which happens after the update is downloaded.   It is SIGNIFICANTLY slower for this game than any of my others.
---
I do West Tek in normal armor. If you get good 3 star Legendary pieces and good perk cards that's easily better than any PA.
---
If you don’t like it, quit.....
---
Yeah i think so as well.
---
Like I’ve said a few times, it’s really hard, because this isn’t a special 4 or 5 star weapon, it’s a normal 3 star with all obtainable effects. There is no reason this should exist, but I cannot think of a way they’d be able to fix it.
---
I know you're not going to like this answer but move your camp.  The map is huge and you've picked somewhere a lot of people want to camp.
---
Yes!!!
---
And someone clearly created this weapon to taunt  Bethesda and mock their  incompetence.  A baseball bat doesn't use bullets and it doesn't need to be reloaded.  Someone put that weapon out there to send a message, which is "Hey Bethesada you are a bunch of idiots who can't stop people like me from breaking your game."
---
Wat
---
Or if not "fun" per se then at least "funny."
---
"... what has this game come to?"
---
I stopped playing a while ago. I don't understand how people who've been playing for an entire year, manage to have any expectations that it will improve. I see people asking for cool features that I would love to see as well but, THIS is what Bethesda would rather give you; continuous lies and disappointment.
---
EA said the same thing with BFV, and look at them now.
---
Before the event, it was. Value after the event has ended will depend on how many will be thrown on the market. 
---
I'm not informed as to how useful the actual grenades are (good for PvP? No idea), so as far as I'm concerned, I would only need them to finally finish that one single possum challenge, and so to me, they are worth exactly one possum badge, and that's not a lot.
---
Completionists would need one of the plans for every one of their active characters, so I figure the demand is / will be there. I found one plan so far, and I'll sit on that and any extras I'll find for a while.
---
The 10 star weapon post was a fake. Somebody has posted a link as prove somewhere in the top of the comment section.
---
The 5 star that was posted though COULD be real.
---
They nearly always run like that.  So not trying to be a dick but:
---
Do more damage quicker and don't miss.
---
It was not like this was some high risk trade to me, someone was offering a 2star lever action for 1.5k caps (nothing compared to what i have so if it was lost in a scam trade that wouldn't be huge to me) and a friend on the game was looking for one like it so i went for it.
---
Anyways it did turn out to just be a update issue and the trade turned out fine with no problems after we got back on, the timing was just Really bad and it turns out the update wasn't even automatic, it had to be manually initiated from dashboard.
---
I did quit, months ago. Just can’t believe it’s still this bad
---
Does this happen in console too? Bcause i play on ps4
---
You can fight the Flatwoods Monster but you just have to be very lucky that it doesn’t disappear. I killed one once without any significant loot.
---
What the fuck are you talking about?
---
What? BFV is a great game... great shooter.
---
I use an SSD, as do a couple of others like Glitch and Fall Damage. When we load into the NW lobby, it's dead silent cuz it's just the SSD players. The only thing you can hear is the air conditioner in the Vault. Other than using ethernet rather than wifi, it's the single biggest performance upgrade you can get for 76 on console. 
---
I use the Samsung T5 drive, which I highly recommend. I tried using the Seagate Game Drive, designed specifically for Xbox. Two of them failed on two separate Xbox consoles. Glitch uses one that is about 4x faster than mine, but it doesn't seem to improve performance accordingly.
---
I’ve noticed this too, recently bought an SSD and moved 76 on to it, game loads in faster and fast travel load times no longer take ages!
---
Yeah, the SSD helps a lot with installation speed.
---
Haha fleetwood monster
---
Go ‘Stros!
---
I am sure I sold 2 or 3 of this plan by 500 each. Oh my xD
---
No wonder they sell so fast :)
---
What platform are you on? If you're on Xbox and bring me the Flux, I can craft all of the mutations.
---
They can detect it, especially in cases where the effects aren't actually used by anything, or when they're on the wrong item. In fact, they've done similar things in the past when it came to duped weapons.
---
As for bans, they *can* ban people for having them if they want to. 
---
Really what they need to do is patch their servers so hacking like this can't be done, and then deal with the items.
---
You can spawn in dev room containers that contain every weapon, every plan, every recipe, every armor recipe (including vault 94 armor), every clothing and armor piece, legendary modules, bulk V94 steel, the Fallout 1st scrap packages, all junk, all consumables, all chem ingredients, etc. I spawned in a bunch at my free characters camp as well as a test planet and the nuke blast which causes curious players to come over and they grab out of the containers. That’s a big no no!
---
That's quite a good tip, never thought of that.
---
"Master Race"
---
Lindsey Buckingham is a slippery foe, indeed.
---
The weapon is hacked in, due to lack of an anti-cheat, items like this can just be made and easily too.
---
BF games are among my favorite videogames. But we can't deny that BFV sold way less than BF1, in big part thanks to EA's attitude.
---
What size ssd are you using?
---
No it’s only on PC as far as I know
---
There are other ways of banning somebody than just deleting their account. They could ban their IP adress for example.
---
\#hottakes
---
Dunno yet, been on private servers all weekend.
---
Take the rifle and commando perks. Swap them as need be. Two is better than one!!!!
---
Not EA atitude... Gamers atitude... I agree with EA on this one...
---
Who cares if it’s not a hot take, nothing ever changes so why stop saying it
---
yet.. here you are
---
When I said they can’t ban people, I didn’t mean it literally. I know they physically can, it’s just that they can’t do it without losing a lot of innocent players at the same time.
---
They can drop weapon prime plans, plus i like the meat to make scorchbeast stew.
---
“My life will be forever Autumn”
---
They drop ultracite and a little xp
---
Thanks for the recommendation, I'm going to try it. I'll check out the T5.
---
well you're not even playing the game anymore, so basically you're just here being a whiny twat it seems
---
Yup, I check every once in a while to see if people still blindly follow Bethesda’s crap and look: here you are!
---
SBQ fights do give random stable flux
---
Someone has to be a whiny twat, because fanboys like you certainly don’t make the game better
---
I have absolutely no problem with this specifically. The bat seems to behave like a regular bat except its hilarious and makes a bold statement of idgaf.
---
500GB for my favorite games and a second 500GB SSD for gameplay videos.
---
Was wondering if anyone else would know where that is haha
---
They might be able to, but changing IP is easy enough.
---
You'll wanna get the High Radiation Fluids, Glowing Mass, &amp; Harden Mass Before gathering the flux. So say you nuke The Whitespring. Kill enemies, collect the ingredients, then collect the nuka flora. Having greentumb gives you 2 per plant so that helps. Then go into Whitespring to stablize it.
---
You do not use raw flux. You have to have stable flux. There is no expiration on that. Look in vendors for the flux. It usually sells between 100-150 caps each
---
This is what the Astros have been using 🤣😂
---
I did em all yesterday, saved me loads of mats haha
---
yum
---
I respect your opinion.
---
They used to go for **at least** 50k, so yeah, too bad, but you'll see more of them in vendors at your price, especially in newbie camps, so you can just buy some back. ;-)
---
Christmas stuff isn't even bundled...ugh costs more then it should do.
---
Nuke whitespring. Kills ghouls and get the mats that don't expire. Then nuke other areas to collect the plants that do expire. Then craft them before they are gone. Use super duper while crafting, ise that perk that doubles your harvested plants while picking them so it is a lot easier to get them. Use the perk to stop your food from spoiling. All those perks maxed out will help you farm like a pro.
---
If you don't want to launch nukes then server hop or look for people here posting they are launching nukes.
---
If on Ps4 I have some spare already crafted yellow flux if you want it. If I have others I will drop them also. For free.
---
Thank you for the response.
---
I got ppl on my buddy list that i have helped once or twice or ppl i have traded with.
---
One of them told me he sends alot of invites so has many servers to pop in on for his vending.  Makes alot sense.
---
Yea true. But this is ridiculous and how much was it
---
Does Mr. Claus' suit come with the beard?
---
Right?
---
Be sure and use the level 2 Contractor perk card to reduce the amount of flux you need.
---
Not seeing a weekly freebie either.  Merry Christmas!
---
Great job fellow Vault Dweller! I am not at work, but I do appreciate the gesture.
---
I've started renaming everything valuable. For everything I want to keep I put a Z in front of the name, so it's like Z Junkies FSS Grognak or so on. That drops it to the bottom of every list and really only puts it near Zealots stuff. Then any legendaries to be scripped, sold or kept, I just rename them -junk, -sell or -keep and they pop to the top of the list. Everything non legendary just stays in the middle and I can scrap it. It's an extra step, but it's saved my hide a few times.
---
About 500 caps, but they probably think people who have them will get banned. There was probably more of them
---
Pro-Tip:  Pull your display cases and vendor machines out of your main camp, off by themselves before moving.  Then they'll be blueprinted, and wont need refilled.
---
ah, I don't mind selling them cheap besides knowing there is a chance someone bought them to resell.
---
Sometimes I give good repeated plans to lv50- players... like marine parts.
---
depends if you play with ears or eyes, as the screech is beyond annoying
---
If I haven’t unlocked backpacks yet but I buy the Santa one do I get it in game?
---
I was hoping this one to be a photoshopped one just like the other 10 star handmade thing.... =/
---
nope :(
---
https://imgur.com/a/DkzBLRn
---
don't think so. you have to craft it.
---
It’s not, I actually saw this in a vendor myself. I could probably get more pictures when I get home, but I’m busy right now.
---
It sucks cause after year one ESO was on a marathon of never ending improvements xD. Maybe wastelanders will be that turn idk.
---
The four armed four legged headless beast.
---
Ugghhhh.  No good.
---
Thanks though!
---
This was the team that made the mp game battleborn doe.
---
You need the pioneer scout backpack before you can make skins for it. Sorry!
---
He will travel real time to the new location from your old one.
---
Three building tips:
---
\- Never build a floating base.
---
\- Never build a square box.
---
\- Never build too big.
---
I can make as many as you want, my psn us gfg6179
---
It will move with you, and it was reported many times that deathclaw upgrade to their lvl 91 glowing version(not guaranteed)
---
So much for the bloodied build😂
---
Back in your day, were you unaware of how to manage your inventory, pick carry weight reduction perks, or just duping? Genuinely curious.
---
I mean, to each their own. I hoard just about everything I come by, but I never had this issue aside from when I actually used PA. Oblivious why people would torment themselves by "playing" like this rather than just picking a few relevant perks.
---
Finally a fireplace that I dont have to make
---
not the original poster but i did save the [pic](https://i.imgur.com/ZV8qn52.png)
---
I'll have to give that a go later. I wonder how many people know if that? Thank you for the tip!
---
Thanks for the troubleshooting advice. I'll check that when I get home and see if it's the case.
---
Pretty shocking the Xmas stuff isn’t bundled!
---
This won't work if you plan to set up any vendor machines,  but I have zero electricity in my camp.  I use the oil street lamps everywhere I need light.  It saves on resources for wires, conduits,  etc.  
---
I started doing this in FO4 and found I really prefered the warmer light and the ability to place them anywhere.  I initially used them in Fo76 without even thinking about it because of this, but eventually came to appreciate the savings it has on the overall budget.
---
The best camps are many structures, not a single 4x3... thats gigantic... I can build a proper camp in a 2x3, even a 1x2...
---
If it snows I'll reinstall
---
Wait, people still willing use their launcher? Update the game &amp; close it, all its useful for anyways.
---
Seems like a silly thing to be up in arms after everything else...
---
Use the balloons. They show damage numbers and can't actually be damaged.
---
Man that is amazing work!
---
I guess the problem is other players.  In a solo game, it's fine if you get to the point where money is no longer an issue for getting equipment.  In an MMO, you have to content with other players comparing their gear and their purchasing power.  It'd be a problem if a 1% trader elite with all the best gear evolved well outside of the reach of newer players.  But, as you say, it's expected that a high level player has more power to obtain equipment than entry characters.  Tricky issue!  That may be one of the hidden benefits of leveled gear- you don't have to worry about getting the best endgame gear until L50 when you start having the power and the money to start getting it.
---
I agree cap limits are a bit of a blunt instrument, designed to hammer players above a certain level down to match the buying power of lower level players. (Or to keep vendor mules in check.)  I guess the issue is keeping items accessible to lower level characters at all.  Without a hard cap limit, I imagine every decent legendary would end up being priced well out of the reach of players who haven't been collecting caps for a hundred levels.  More available caps means higher prices, while PVE income remains the same.  
---
But that's just speculation.  We already see a barter market now, where most of the really high-end items are only available for trade, because sellers are too close to their caps limit to price items for what they're worth.  I wish there was a better way, too.
---
You think they will bring back the old Santa suit from last year?
---
Son of a beesting do I want that fireplace
---
Nop, if you dont take the time to see my build I dont want your caps.
---
This actually wouldn't be too hard - assuming this works vaguely like Fallout 4, there's a function that can fetch all the eligible legendary effects for an item (the code to generate a legendary item is basically generate item - fetch eligible legendary effects - choose effect at random). So they can in principle loop over every item in player's inventories, check to see if it has valid legendary effects, and then delete invalid items. They'd need to be careful to check against effects that have *ever* been eligible, as people are going to get pissed if their legacy weapons get deleted.
---
So they can handle item-specific unobtainable effects.
---
The thing that would be really hard to detect are items with *item specific* obtainable effects (e.g. if someone cheated in a bloodied explosive handmade).
---
you can't :(
---
I don't think the small backpacks you get earlier allow the skins as they are smaller
---
Reminds me of blizzard with diablo 2 and 3
---
Go to Morgantown airport and get the small one from the overseers stash. I think it can be customized but I’m not 100% sure
---
Yes but only because I still harbor the most bitter of hatreds for them from leveling at launch.
---
Destroying the cores was probably the fastest part of the run. A comment above talks of nuka grenades still work. Going to try that later tonight
---
lone wanderer works when you are not in a team. 
---
If you are not in a team, and at a public event, you still are not in a team.  It works at events.
---
a gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes
---
as if to hide a lonely tear
---
my life will be forever autumn
---
cos you're not here
---
Same. The hate train put me off the game at launch even though I got the game as a Christmas present. I didn't play until August and I wished I never listened to the haters. Still having fun with the game 4 months later.
---
It's a public service. And where I got the prime receiver for my LMG scorch beast killer. Kinda karma.
---
White Knights can't accept that Bethesda is wrong in this matter and want to blame the user instead of holding Bethesda accountable to fix their error.
---
I missed the beard last year and was hoping it would show up today ...
---
Two versions of mothman... Well 2 behavior. Most common is to just watch you and poof away when you're getting close. Rarer one it will attack you.
---
Flatwoods monster seems more rare but it seems like it always attacks and has a frenzy aura that turns everything hostile. I first saw it at whitesprings when I was a low lvl.  Whole place attacked me.
---
Thats all i was waiting for!  dang.  Was the Santa suit different last year?
---
where the fuck is that snazzy blue suit?!?
---
It is a Silly Thing, No Question, It's just the sheer Volume of Silly Stupid Mistakes that is getting me Fired Up!
---
Depends how high level you are really, if you don’t have a strong build then they’re a waste of ammo and time, if you’re strong enough to take them out in a few hits then they’re worth it for the prime plans junk and xp
---
Shoutout to all of you. I'm going to give Scorched Claus a break and try some of the suggested ideas.
---
Yup haha.
---
Still nothing for the past two days.
---
Ugh, XB servers still aren't bsck for me. It's been 2 hours.
---
Where's the bundles?
---
I wanted the beard with the outfit! Beth!!! lol Beth can you hotfix a beard in before Xmas? Beard fix 1.0
---
The drop rates for the rare taxidermy, weapon, and armor plans are better on the crafted versions.
---
This outfit actually does come with the Santa beard. I just purchased and was surprised to see it in crafting.
---
When major cheats get public...that’s where we are now unfortunately. It’ll get worse...
---
It serves me just fine
---
Any weapon is viable in PVP if you know how to use it.
---
There are ways around any weapon and armor combination in the game.   Vs explosives Dense/Fireproof (doesnt stop the ballistic damage)
---
If you are fighting Teslas, then leather armor.
---
Against straight ballistic, Combat armor and DR perks.
---
I can make a stupid argument against any weapon type and why it sucks in PVP.  But people kill with them every day.
---
Im sorry my choice for PVP is not your ideal optimal.  I dont give a shit.  Come here and let me kill you with it.
---
They're more or less supposed to do that. Especially the first few times you meet them. They'll show up, bask in their own ominous presence, look at you in a way that says, "soon..." and then VOOMP! off into the darkness.
---
When you're a bit more leveled they'll consider you worthy of a fight... even if it's a bit more unsatisfying than you hoped. But for now it gives you something to look forward to when roaming the hills at night.
---
I can’t use my fermenter if I don’t leave room on the budget
---
Man... I remember making whites on open D2, damn some of them you couldn't even look at in inventory because it would crash the game.... good times.
---
This issue appears to have now been fixed
---
Ive done 50K at least just myself. Finally got Icicle Lights, Santa Crash, and all the Mounts so i can stop crafting the Large Gifts. Now if my Legendaries i have up in the Market would sell i could get cracking on a bunch of Small Presents to try for some of the other plans.
---
Personally, I just put the stuff I know is good in my vendor for what I consider a fair price. Yeah, it might get scooped up by someone who will just resell it for a fortune, but it also might not and it might make a player's day. I have no interest in getting involved in the racket of the trade board and I've gotten all my good legendaries from player vendors or in the wild.
---
I am legit disappointed to not see it available. Maybe next week.
---
Oh sweet, leave it to BGS to NOT put that in the description, lol
---
It’s not that hard when the server doesn’t check what the client sends, or if the data is modified...it’s a major security fail that even the least techy guy knows to check and work on
---
Well, finally a paintjob for my most used melee weapon, so there's that. Underwhelming update in every other respect, though.
---
I have seen a 5 star legendary doing the rounds. Some interesting traits I hadn't seen elsewhere too.
---
I bought the Santa outfit and it does come with a beard.
---
The only skin that works on the small backpacks is the Arktos Pharma skin you randomly get by completing Project Paradise. It only unlocks for your current character, not the whole account like Atomic Shop stuff.

---
Damn now you're set for life with that bat
---
I remember that lol I was making those weapons with an editor, you had to have the right balance of crazy damage and abilities. One time I made one at the damage cap with every offense ability on it. When I used it my game would instantly crash. Wasn't till I played with some friends did I find out I crashed everyone else who was playing with me lol
---
You sir are a wise man, thank you and a very Happy Holidays to you!
---
Since nobody said it yet, make sure to use super duper when you craft Flux! Good with salt or refrigerator backpack helps as well until you get back to CAMP.
---
He will walk to your new location just make sure that you don't sign out or move your camp again in till he gets there
---
This. I’ve almost scrapped my hunter’s longcoat a few times.
---
Fair enough.
---
I added it to Steam along with a secondary exe for dual booting, second one references a secondary ini for lower quality graphics though tbf I'm not sure that whole step was necessary.
---
They'll probably be released next week.
---
Hot is not the same as “hot”. 
---
Also zero human caused emissions now.
---
Yeah must suck not being good and having to cheat to get good weapons.
---
The issue is that salt shakers don't, so if you pick up one green seasoning stick, and it's the wrong one, you might go "oh don't bother" unless you hoard plastic.
---
I did rifleman for a really long time before switching to commando. As long as you fire in short controlled bursts, you hardly use any more ammo doing commando.  I end up making more ammo at pretty much the same frequency as before. As long as you aren't just hip firing blindly it's pretty comparable.  That being said, I do prefer rifleman in general and it's how I would normally play fallout games.  Low level enemies I can tap the trigger and fire a single round,  I just like having the dps available for the tankier enemies.
---
I just got he Icicle Lights last night as well. Nice Camp. Damn that makes me want to buy the Christmas Bulbs in the Atom Shop. Guess i should quit being a cheap bastard (i have 5800 Atoms saved) and just pull the trigger.
---
🤣
---
Not all heroes wear capes (or perhaps he does)
---
Yes it does I have the mr. Claus beard hat and suit and I just purchased a suit
---
I agree that the person/s who made these tools, are at another level. People don't understand the level of logic sense you need to have in order to create this. People think you can "just hack" - it isn't so. Most of us wouldn't even be able to use the tools, even with a full manual.
---
Maybe you're just in a popular spot?
---
I bought out someone’s vending machine of gifts last night. I don’t think they knew what they were selling. 20 large gifts boxes for 10 caps each.
---
I found a spot I really like &amp; haven't moved from it in many many months.   Having said that,  though, I am actually on my 6th or 7th incarnation of my treehouse on the same spot.  Over time, I repeatedly ran into issues with the boundaries of my building elements getting more restrictive,  so I wouldn't be able to put a wall back that I had just "temporarily" removed so I could make some other adjustment.   
---
This has actually had a beneficial side effect, though,  as the placement of everything just works so much better now.  (It's really tricky to make sure everything will line up right when you are trying to work around existing structures 8-9 stories up and you're being given maybe only 4 options for the starting point (due to other existing structures, trees, water, what have you.)
---
Same thing happened the first few times I encountered them. Just gotta be quick and do some heavy damage. By the time you see them again you should have better weapons. Ive been playing since the beginning and encountered both less than 10 times total.
---
Not really, imo.
---
Wish people would check out the qa managers name on LinkedIn and see who’s the blame 😑
---
I hoard everything!!
---
Hopefully tomorrow?
---
Have you seen the actual fireplace in the Atom store, added today???
---
Don't worry, because the guys posting it on a public forum for everyone to see give you everything pretty much done. You only have to introduce the script.
---
That's why it makes it even more frustrating that Bethesda seems to be unable to do anything about it.
---
I can’t figure it out either
---
I want an outfit to where for Christmas!
---
Yeah, this is BS. They've bundled averything else, are they even releasing more X-mas stuff?
---
No worries, I don't mind doing that, either. But you could have traded those plans for a legendary or even legacy weapon of your choice if you'd known. ;-)
---
Please, could anyone tell me if there is a handmade skin available in the atom shop ?
---
I don't mind the cost, but I would play again if there is a skin for the handmade.
---
I saw a black skin and a golden one, but I don't know if I can buy them now.
---
Please !
---
I was just looking them up last night too. Too bad I could only find that seagate exclusive one, that one was nearly 200 bucks
---
Why would you bother selling while the events in progress, prices will skyrocket immediately after its over.
---
That is a fair observation, an I only got it for 20 dollars. Which a standard movie ticket where I am at is about 12.
---
Hey, sorry to "high jack" your thread, but is there a handmade skin available for then handmade currently ? I'm on ps4, if it matters.
---
right  but Raw is required for the Stable, and I am having issues getting the raw flux due to various reasons..
---
interesting, will try and replicate, thanks!
---
incoming "temporary bans" and a partial dupe wipe, followed by Fallout 2nd, where you can get semi-private "servers" for only 50 bucks a year
---
Nah, 10* weapons aren't real. But it's a fact that 5* guns with ridiculous effects (I've seen an explosive *baseball bat*) are starting to flood the market.
---
I don't see how Bethesda can fix this. They probably will let it be.
---
This is one the biggest places I have failed so far, great advice, ty!
---
They debundled a lot. Personally all I wanted was Santa outfit so I am pumped!
---
Are they really flooding the market?
---
doublekill!
---
wait...
---
I forgot about this perks when I swapped to an all DPS perk build.  Thanks for the advice, and yes I am on PS4.
---
Wow, I totally missed that one, I need to see if I have it, or get it...
---
Only on PC, but yeah. It's starting to be a real problem.
---
There’s still a few things missing, I assume they will be released next week
---
The beard is there.  Go look at the apparel section.
---
do you work for Bethesda?
---
Sell it for 30k!
---
Noobs Will just buy it
---
You can also make a post. Sometimes folks will even build for you for a set price.
---
Thanks, more solid advice!
---
there was a raider one, but i think thats it?
---
I guess you've never played GTA Online then. FFS. Yes, Bethesda don't give a shit. I post about how this sucks and get upvotes for a day, then wake up to negative because of downvotes. I'm not here for a popularity contest so it don't matter but I find it funny, day your FO76 criticism post gets upvotes, day 2 the fanboys come and downvote the post and every comment you make in it. These fanboys will defend Bethesda no matter what they do.
---
Following as I am also wanting to know
---
I’m so glad they debundled!
---
Oh yeah, I'm surprised I haven't been downvoted to oblivion already. That's proof enough that this is a big problem.
---
I killed one once and then I got disconnected from the server before I could check it for loot.
---
You can't customize the Small Backpack.
---
How so?  Not really noticed anything.
---
Be patient young one, usually takes a bit for them to update the new ones.
---
Battlefield V, that's what game provides an inconsistent player experience as well.
---
In the image of the 10* handmade, the effect “Bullets explode for area damage” has a period at the end, but the others don’t.
---
This weeks is the worst mission, imo. the other 2 are more interesting.
---
i like how you complain but buy it anyway\^\^
---
There is the Christmas TENT for 1st players, but I guess they figure the Santatron is it for everyone else this season.
---
There isn't at this time. A few weeks back they had the black paint for it but it was limited time.
---
I was looking forward to a female Santa. Was there one last year?
---
Mrs Claus outfit is in the game just not legitimately obtainable yet
---
Why wouldn’t I? It’s worth experimenting with at the very least.
---
If you do get an SSD, it's going to take some time to make the switch, and please, learn from my mistakes 😂 here's the best way to switch. It's probably best to do this an hour or two before bed. 
---
1) Back up any photos you want to keep.
---
2) Uninstall Fallout 76 and any add-ons you have.
---
3) Plug the SSD into your Xbox (a rear USB port is probably better). Format the SSD when asked.
---
4) Go to your Storage settings and select the SSD as the default game installation location.
---
5) If you have a digital copy, skip step 5 and 9. Otherwise, go to your Network settings and set your Xbox to offline - this prevents issues with the game trying to update while installing, leading to a corrupt install.
---
6) Restart your Xbox by holding the Xbox button and selecting Restart.
---
7) Install Fallout 76.
---
8) Restart your Xbox as in step 6.
---
9) Go to your Network settings and set your Xbox to Online.
---
10) Go to Manage Game for Fallout 76 and then select the updates tab. Update the game. This can take several hours, so like... Sleep for the night or go to work.
---
11) Log into the game and allow it to sync your profile. Go into the Atomic Shop and favorite your NW cosmetic items. It's very important that people be able to recognize you when you're wrecking them.
---
12) Play the game with much less lag (there will still be hiccups, this is still Fallout 76).
---
After the patch installs I will hit you up
---
It's basically the price of a wall decoration I believe
---
I can’t believe people actually believed that was real lmao. Impossible to go over 5*
---
that's what I thought this was at first...
---
Because the effect has a period at the end
---
I understand, but just one day before Christmas? Bethesda should consider all those playing with female characters.
---
I never did that XP glitch but boy I sure lived in a hazmat suit whenever Whitesprings got nuked. 1k XP for 1 bullet? Yes please.
---
Mad nice. Didnt know you could do this. Thank you.
---
So do I uaut highlight and store before dropping a new camp?
---
Should have bought some of the things last week. 😐
---
Ah yes same loved that
---
*wear!!!!!
---
I think I found a guy selling the explosive baseball bat in my post, these people ruin the game with this stuff.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ebvrcs/found_this_in_a_vendor_what_has_this_game_come_too/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
I believe I saw they are scheduled to start today (Dec, 17th) at 7:00PM ET.
---
Also, be careful about scrapping unique items.  I somehow had the ability to build that one globe one day, despite never buying/ unlocking it.  This made me very happy.  Up until the day I scrapped it to clear room for one of my re-builds and found that I no longer had the ability to build it.
---
Spoiled meat has always given you diseases. Carnivore doesn't make you immune to that. The same applies for Herbivore and spoiled fruit/veggies.
---
It's a glitch. Sometimes closing out of the game will fix it, sometimes quickly fast traveling before you "pass out"/load again works too.
---
I was considering the Santa outfit too, but I really want the Mrs too!  Show us females more love
---
Then I must be lying! /shrug
---
This sub is on another level of bitching. Competitive shooters like Siege have blatant teleporting and aimboting hackers 4 years after release. But having more OP guns than usual OP guns in a game where you  don't even interact with other people most of the time is the worst, ofc.
---
So certain plans are behind certain present sizes? Been buying just the large presents because I thought that's where the actual good stuff is 😅
---
Agree :)
---
K
---
Personally, I find it fun to hunt scorch beasts. But then, I set up my character to do just that.  I no longer weigh resources/reward.  For me it’s just fun. 
---
Depends on your build as to how difficult they are to kill.  I’ve had builds that could hunt scorch beasts by level 60.  And I’ve seen players over level 100 that couldn’t put a dent in them.  
---
What’s fun for you?
---
Mostly same here. It seems like one of those issues that might go away entirely for a patch cycle or consecutive patch cycles then patching something else randomly makes it worse for another patch or several. Just like food/drink/fusion core drain rates, and that thing where sometimes the last scorchbeast you killed travels all over the map with you.
---
It seems they have gotten away from bundles lately.
---
nice little village you got there
---
I've been using it with a sniper rifle. When I miss a 95% chance I cry a little.
---

---
Breaks down everything. After getting the Rare Mounts and the Camp items if you only care about getting the other plans you are missing it makes more sense to craft small presents. The large and medium do have chances for extra plans but its very very rare so not worth the extra caps cost.
---
I'll give you half my lunchable for it
---
Enslaving people was wicked in Fallout 3, would love for it to come back. Could bring back some of the dark shit this series has seemed to have lost as well.
---
The real problem is that you have a game that is such a buggy, glitchy mess, easily hacked on PC, that when people see these things they are believed. If this game was properly maintained ie bug fixes, anti cheat etc, you would see a lot less of this. This shit is firmly in Bethesda ballpark and they are unable or unwilling to fix.
---
changes are you awarded a guy creating it, while not liking what he did.
---
 and we still dont know how bethesda will react to those items.
---
Oh my god the Candy Cane skin for the Walking Cane. I feel the laughter from a year ago coming back.
---
It really only matters if you’re into PvP.
---
Now that's a mutant!
---
I’ll help you out....
---
I ran into the same problem.  Filled the twitch redirect to Bethesda.net to link accounts and then ‘claimed’ my prize.  Showed it as claimed and still nothing in camp or showing up in atom shop.
---
THE FIX:  Log into Bethesda.net in a separate window (NOT from the twitch redirect).  On the Bethesda page click the user icon at the top right and then scroll down to ‘Linked Accounts’. You’ll probably see your PS4 linked but Twitch isn’t (even though linking through twitch redirect said it was a ‘Success’). Simply link to Twitch from the +option.  Voila!!!  Go restart game and you’ll see it in atom shop and in camp.
---
For some reason the twitch redirect linking doesn’t work even though it says success...you MUST link to twitch directly from Bethesda.net!
---
Good luck!
---
Bethesda: "We have noticed that a number of players would like an environmental change for weather, so we added a Winter and Spring aesthetic. **It'll just cost you $100**."
---
Appreciate it!
---
I got mine right away (Xbox) but a guy posted here earlier today that it took 4 days to show up in his account
---
10* legendaries arent real.  They cant hurt you
---
I think players running around with 10* weapons and armor and TSE baseball bats is probably not healthy for server stability
---
Did they update it then? You use to lose your pet when you moved
---
I finally heard them last night.  I was teamed up with my nephew, had headphones on and they were clear as day.
---
When I'm not wearing headphones though and the sound is just coming from the TV set up?  Nope.  Can't hear them for the life of me.
---
Don’t need pa except for fixing the reactor. Have all three hacker cards for using the terminals to take care of the turrets. Carry troubleshooter or instigating weapons.
---
Bloodied stealth rifleman its good, also just stealth rifleman with full chameleon its also really good
---
Yet you’re still shitposting.
---
I am not saying you are, just wondering what you have seen.  As a PVE player not sure how this even will affect me other than mess with the already wonky economy.
---
Also, put the vendor blueprint down FIRST, before you build anything else. I've had them lose their stock when I spent too long building other stuff in the new camp.
---
I seen that thing in a movie once when I was young and it creeped me out. 
---
It was nice to know they put them in my favorite game.
---
See my other reply; if you kids just constantly jerk of Bethesda how will they ever change their predatory practices
---
Well X01 of course lol. Another reason to wait till lvl 50...
---
Sad. Thanks for the info
---
I have full XO1 at lvl 40
---
Got a Plasma Grenade and Plasma Mine plans and some random other plans that were not related to head mounts.
---
Ultracite is lvl 50
---
I was speaking literally, yesterday all my comments and a post a made on the same subject had mostly upvotes, this morning all negative. I deleted the thread, if we can't even have an honest conversation about the situation how can we expect things to improve? May your post still hold up tomorrow.
---
I have not received it in probably close to 100 presents, I have not kept an accurate count.
---
I've gotten two so far,both from small gifts. Used one,will probably sell for 10-20k depending on market after event.
---
Anywhere Mr Messenger spawns is a pet spawn.
---
Yup. This bug went away for a while, but seems to have come back in patch 15.
---
My deathclaw changes level occasionally, going as high as 91. But he stays mostly at the level at which I found him: 21.
---
I've gotten four. Learned one, sold the others, all for 10K caps. They're certainly less rare than they were before, but that's a high bar. They're by no means common now - that four is from opening over 200 gifts.
---
The game already automatically bundles your existing build as a different variant of blueprint with stored things.  But it's rare you can place it, which is why you want to separate it.
---
If you separate it out, make sure to also disconnect power before moving CAMP.  I've had problems with blueprints primarily when there is a power link that exits the blueprint to nowhere.
---
If you really want to hurt... I bought it out of someone's vendor for 500.  :D  I already have a 3* AAE handmade, so I just held onto that one till I was low on caps.
---
I accidentally bought them the other day. I clicked on them to see the individual emotes and presto! They were mine. Lol.  I think they are ok but not worth 800 atoms
---
People would be able to buy it from the legendary exchange for scrip, and get the armor without doing the vault raids
---
That's what I meant sorry. After 50 you're going to want it to be max level and resistances right? I did the same thing and within a few days was hunting tons of springs and screws again. Btw that's in sugar grove, tons of desk fans, globes and clipboards if you didn't already notice...
---
The scrap box is part of the fallout 1st subscription service.  It holds all non bulked scrap..unlimited amounts
---
Browse groups on XB1, the one I play with is the "Minutedudes of WV", No kids allowed, &amp; most of the Active group members have multiple characters over level 200, you don't need to be that high but I recommend teaming up with others that are still leveling so you can run the quests together.
---
Ahh I guess they would..
---
Give or take in 250 presents I've had 2, first dropped from a small present and the second from a large handmade present.
---
They do exist, they still afaik still share the same rarity from quests and explosive boxes but because these presents are much easier to obtain the chances are higher, after the event ends they'll go back to being stupidly rare again.
---
Are there any other updates besides the atom shop today?
---
Haha I've got the map screenshotted already but thank you! Just wondering how people get high level spawns or if there is a glitch to make them higher level
---
I wouldnt have my XO1 if I didnt
---
👍🏼
---
Ah ok. 21 is the high DC I’ve seen. My alt character has a level 35 mirelurk King though.
---
Seems people complain either way tbh. I would like to see all items in one large bundle for a teduced atom cost and all the individual items available separately.  Best of both worlds in my opinion.
---
There's a small update/patch to download but as far as fixes or things added I'm not sure yet. Next Inside The Vault I'm sure will have some info
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bsyukf/new_map_of_random_encounter_locations_found_by/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
All the red dots.
---
If it doesn't bother you, good!
---
But it should definitely bother Bethesda.
---
Can you still get the kings? I believe they cannot be tamed anymore
---
The regular handmade gifts have the best chance to give weapon plans. To game that further, only open these gifts on character below level 5 as it will eliminate any plans requiring a minimum level.
---
I literally just picked up an external 500GB SSD last week from Amazon for $59 for this reason.
---
Amen to that, let it snow!
---
 Pretty sure there is a major snow event happening at this moment! So it not like west Virginia isn't getting snow.
---
So you make yourself a gift and then open it?
---
Yeah idk where you got that from my profile, I’m 23 with a job and buy my own stuff just fine thanks. 
---
Again, you can’t refute my argument so you resort to ad hominem. Good to see plenty of munchkins like you still play 76.
---
I noticed the same. Multiple misses at 95%. Exit VATS and try again, hit first time.
---
I wish the aluminum tree set was a bit cheaper.
---
Fireplace is a solid buy IMO though, even at the 500 atoms.
---
Seeing the 3-wallpaper set drop down to 640 atoms is kinda nice. I didn't pull the trigger on that one initially and may do it now.
---
Anybody know how much budget the giant rocket takes up from the Red Rocket bundle? Is it similar to a flag or what?
---
I've wait around 4 day for them.
---
Weird, cause this morning I had an issue, the launcher was saying I had to buy the game again, I contracted customer support, and within 5 minutes they replied and resolved my problem.
---
A day one ps4. The pro should be even morw optimized from what i read.
---
You're Gona have to be a high ranking mage to dodge dark cloaked dimension slash!
---
Lol because you’re one of the few players that still plays their trash game and they can’t afford to lose you too? 
---
Keep it up tho
---
Indeed , you don't need to claim them in game (only from the website with prime reward).  
---
I've see they was on my account while browsing the atom shop for check something for a friend.
---
For all the shit Bethesda's done, if they changed all the hacked weapons to have effects like this I would have a fair bit of respect for their creativity.
---
Tip: Equip Chemist to get x2 crafting of the gifts.
---
You can make yourself a gift (2 if you have the Chemist perk equipped), and you can open it yourself, just like the ones that drop from Xmas Scorched, or you can trade it.
---
Spawns scale to your level (within a threshold based on region). Glowing is the highest level variant for Honey Beasts.
---
I've been wanting the Red Rocket bundle..mostly just the sign but not sold individually..that said I'm guessing its the same budget as say The Mothman Statue or the BOS statue. As its interactive. The rocket takes off.
---
$20k? My stupid ass has been selling legendaries for caps this whole time.
---
That's the weirdest Grafton Monster yet.
---
  Troubleshooters, and PA if you have it. (I did it in L45 Excavator.  targeting HUD made it easier to spot the turrets)
---
Move slow, crouch and peek around corners to locate the turrets, back up.   Pre-aim the weapon, ease back around the corner, snipe the turret.  back up, repeat as needed to kill the turret(s).  
---
I've heard, but cannot verify, having multiple people in the silo makes it more difficult. (I ran it solo, but I was way above L40)
---
Healing factor mutation will greatly reduce your need for stimpacks (IIRC, I only used 2)
---
There was nearly 20 people on this morning. lol
---
You can be butthurt all you like. It’s just funny to see you rage like they owe your entitled ass something.
---
Troubleshooters handmade works well
---
Wow nearly 20? Insane!!! Those numbers!! 
---
They don’t owe me jack shit, I just want them to fix their absolutely dogshit game because it could’ve been fun. Instead we got nuclear winter and fallout 1st and wastelanders was delayed. How can you possibly defend that?
---
Ah, that would make more sense since it's interactive.  Ummm...so what's the budget for those look like? I don't have either of them. 
---
I'm at max camp budget so if I want to see if I can even work around my camp to fit it in if possible.
---
Find them in random locations like train stations or around watoga. 
---
Cannot craft.
---
No they are able to track it, they just don't like removing it because they know lots of people prolly payed allot for it. This was talked about in juice heads video
---
Most people dropping that amount of caps are likely hoping very rare recipes that you can't buy.  Think plasma grenade plans.
---
I've been trying to complete the LUCK test for the past month-and-a-half.  Have tried every possible combination of removing/shuffling perk cards, switch weapons, and removed/put on Power Armour  . . . haven't gotten off a Critical Shot even with the Critical-o-meter maxxed out.  Wish I hadn't started this one, eh?
---
Could you teach me how to git gud at RNG?
---
Will he engage mobs he encounters along the way? Can he die?
---
Damn nice haul bud. If I ever see you on PS4 I'll certainly buy the Icicle Lights. It's all I crave lol. Happy Holidays 🎁
---
Where can you get the suit?
---
Yes and yes.
---
I’ve got 9800 atoms I’ve been waiting to soend
---
Thanks for the replies guys, that makes since.  Saving them in the stash box wasnt the best ideal now I read this.  Figured I could google it but some times I like to find stuff the hard way.  Keeps me going.
---
We all made it seem to be against bundles ,but that was because they were poorly handled. Bundles should have a discount on the total of the item they contain,and there should always be an option to buu said item indipendently. They did none of this most the times and we obviously let them know. Now it's up to them to decide how to sell their items.
---
Dang, that's a shame.. wonder why the Fo76 wiki says they cant be crafted... weird..

i have finally been able to get 2 versions of fallout 76 running on 2 monitors (one version on each monitor) thanks to this guide, so thank you very much for that, but my mods are not working on my secondary monitor.  everything working fine on the primary monitor.  any clues what i can do to fix this?
---
This absolutely.
---
That’s just it. You get Bethesda to clean their game then you get maybe a couple of legit players along the way. Not to mention all of the hackers that will lie through their teeth to get out of a ban. Bethesda ain’t got the back bone to handle these people.
---
I got some. Saving it, and a few other rare plans I've found, to trade if I don't get all the heavy metal armor plans before the end of the month. Although I hope I can get all the camp decorations too...
---
I'm doing exactly that, though only had one or two sell.
---
I might randomly list one for 100 caps, just once.
---
On the server I was on. (Thought that was implied)
---
So even though you make it, it's RNG what comes out of it when you open it?
---
Obviously it was implied, I was being facetious. 
---
What about the other things I said? You glaze over points that are inconvenient to you huh?
---
I have two pieces of unyielding armor equip and normally use bloodied rifles. But as far as I know those haven't been having issues.
---
Fallout 76 isn’t an MMO, but your point still stands
---
They want it all and then some.
---
I agree.
---
Thanks for the info and link!
---
Boba Fett dies
---
Hahahaha fuck me lmao
---
This. The rest of the build can essentially be indistinguishable.
---
It does say when you start it that it's meant for a team. I tried by myself, maybe got halfway or so before I ran through all my stims (85), at level 100.
---
That was terrible. It should not punish you without giving you some kind of space to breathe. Was it me or were the mobs doing more damage? I don't recall mirelurk king spam being nearly so killy.
---
That will be in the Mistress for Christmas bundle
---
Does anyone know if you can wear the skill mask with head gear?  Found out the hard way $$ you couldn't wear the any of the 3 glasses set with head gear.  Was disappointing.
---
Cause they can go their own way.
---
For what it is worth (not much) I too have noticed this.
---
I *think* head shots may be showing a bugged percentage. I generally only have this issue on headshots. If I switch to centermass/torso I seem to hit at whatever percentage it says.
---
[](/flutterwhoa)
---
Oh you mean your pathetic, whiney bitch, post? Yeah, I’ve never experienced any of those issues. If I did I would have went to Bethesda with them, not Reddit.
---
I've noticed water and food going down quicker aswell
---
That's not what i meant. I meant that  it must really suck being good and having to cheat to get good weapons and not grind like the rest of us.
---
Lol, you’re really incapable of discussion huh? 
---
Have a nice day.
---
Thanks. Helpful. Question is, what did the update do?
---
I checked and can’t craft that. I’ve linked my account twice now so maybe I just need to wait longer😥
---
I’ve claim it on the website but nothing.
---
They can only drop on Large. Same with Santa Crash and most of the Rare Mounted Heads. Large Presents are rare Drops from the Holiday Scorched (only gotten about 4 and i have been farming) so your best bet is to buy the High Quality Wrapping Paper and Craft your own (Make Sure to equip Chemist!). I was unlucky enough to only get it after spending about 50K Caps on Wrapping Paper Santa Crash has the same drop chance but i ended up with 5 of those, Damn RNG.
---
I got the fireplace as it will look good all year. The FO1st holiday survival tent has a really nice looking decorated tree and a rotating snowflake nuka cola lamp in it. Bit surprised those are not for sale separately.
---
After their separation they prefer the term consciously uncoupled, or self-partnered.
---
&gt; You think those people duping 10 effect items are doing it because they want or need 10 effect items? They're doing it to prove a point.
---
No, that was a photoshop made by someone to troll a group of dupers to see if they could replicate it. Spoiler alert: they couldn't.
---
But, I agree with everything else. They have cheaters because they obviously don't care if they exist, or at least don't care enough to actually fix it. And, I truly believe they only fixed the bug they introduced last patch so quickly because Fallout 1st members on console complained. This is shown by the second part of the fix coming to consoles today, after they said "well, it worked on the ~~guinea pigs~~ PC players, so let's let consoles have it".
---
Im planning on getting mr clause suit (even though i play a female character) and the sants Claus backpack.
---
Just wished I could travel without the use of power armor.
---
Theorizing that one could fast travel while overencumbered, user SamBeckett drank a Nukashine, and vanished. 
---
He woke to find himself in a different place, but after a short amount of time, he would fast travel again.
---
And so, SamBeckett journeys from place to place, striving to put right what one went wrong, and hoping each time that his next fast travel... will be the fast travel home.
---
Fresh servers or private world's are the only times I've not experienced this
---
Buying it right now, I’ll let you know
---
Holy god damn !!!
---
Shameless ploy by Bethesda to visit the atom shop. I on to you Todd.
---
If they did this id probably redownload it just to fuck around in it a bit. They usually do it in GTA for a bit around christmas and its a cool change
---
10* legendaries: bullets explode for area damage,  each consecutive hit does more damage
---
I'm over 300k easily. But I did finally get every plan available from the event. Now I just have to sell all my spares and make some back.
---
Also, the camp builds that he shows involving factions are fantastic!
---
If you're on xbox I can sell you the flux for 100 caps each.
---
I bougt the xmas bulbs the day they came out. Still hunting down the icicles plan.
---
Imagine buying a legendary weapon for 500 bucks lmao. That being said, trading in game things for real money has been a thing since a long time. Look at CS:GO with its skins. I even know minecraft servers with people managing to sell things for more than 500 euros, and im not even joking. This is not just a thing from Fallout 76 but something that happens in the whole industry. As long as you have multiplayer, you have people selling in game stuff for IRL money.
---
Love u sage
---
Han Solo dies.....wait wrong movie.
---
did you double  check the second "custom" ini and make sure the mods are in that one?
---
Unscheduled interruption = vulnerability patch my guess
---
Ah shit is that was holiday wrapping does? I saw graham selling some and I didn't feel like dropping 1.5kish on wrapping. I thought it was to drop presents or some shit for other players lol
---
to switch it up for the holidays. GTA is set in California basically and they put snow in around christmas too
---
Thanks, The issue looks to have fixed in the hotfix
---
They got effects that are only in Fallout 4. (Yes im aware they exist in 76s game files)
---
I feel like the real issue is that Bethesda simply does not care about PC specifically.  The consoles have the numbers, I'd bet less than 25% of the copies sold are on PC maybe 15% or less.  
---
So when the hacks happen mostly on PC they get largely ignored.  Follow the money.  
---
But hacks that impact consoles are clearly higher priority.  The only way to get hacking fixed is to figure out how to extend the PC hacks to consoles, make it widespread and available to all.  Then and only then will hacking be addressed.
---
The Borg invade Coruscant.
---
I thought that's what people asked for to have both, but they only seem to do just one or the other... One would think they'd make a little more profit if they appease the bundle buyers and individual item buyers, but :shrugs:
---
there is a free backpack that you dont need to do Pioneer scouts for? I already did them, but never knew about this unless I misunderstood what the person was talking about
---
Agreed. It’s that, that help come to the plausibly that one of the unopened vaults could be used for player factions. Big vault, can be instanced for safety. And be linked to a separate world. And be link to all worlds for sending to and from.

Apologies for the absolutely terrible quality pic
---
I was really hoping we'd get a handmade with 40% faster swing speed
---
ok zoomer
---
Look at all that stuff I cant add to my camp due to having no budget left
---
It would be nice if your pets could scale to your level instead
---
Whats the free item?
---
FYI, I bought the xmas light set, and was terribly disappointed at how hard it was to be place them. 
---
Granted, I don't have a traditional 'house' camp, but really found I couldn't place them where I wanted.
---
I like the suggestion elsewhere of adding lights to the power wires that already exist.
---
I basically build farm houses - one for crafting and one for me. They are small (generally 2x3) and are made to be aesthetically pleasing, instead of flashy and potentially gaudy. I like to give them a nice view as well, so one wall may just be the low defensive wall looking out over a river or view from a clifftop.
---
Maybe just learn to aim your gun better and not rely upon Vats auto aim system so much.
---
Thank you for supporting my point that there are aspects of the community totally complicit in this behavior
---
It's always been this sordid hypocrisy.  They whine when someone like Bethesda does pay-to-win, but in the same breath, some will go and spend real money on eBay for gear and think nothing of it.
---
What makes it all rather pathetic is that there is really no "win" state in 76 to begin with.
---
I know you guys are kidding but my game worked fine until I did that update on my ps4, it now crashes on opening
---
You probably need to apply an update. Happened to me earlier
---
It might be a part of the twitch prime rewards but idk
---
Is there a hat?
---
Seems this is a fake photo. Was photoshopped. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ebyo1r/beware_the_fake_screenshots_even_on_this_sub/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Is it already decorated or do you have to switch it from normal to decorated? Because it its already decorated that means it's most likely temporary through the holidays until Bethesda changes it back...which would be sad...
---
If I can't find your vending machines quickly or easily, you won't get them anyway. =P
---
Yup! It was added after pioneer scouts. It’s a much more simplified version.
---
Yes. There's a static list of things it can be, but it's RNG which ones you will get.
---
Typically, it includes a junk item, alcohol, and a plan, although the small gifts often don't have plans, and the larger ones even have caps from 10 to 1000 caps (I believe). It's definitely RNG.
---
There is a Google Doc floating around that has the % chances of each individual item as well as which size present they come out of.
---
Try restarting - fixed it for me
---
Darth Vader is Luke's father. There, you've been spoiled.
---
That's correct.  It has half the capacity and you can't apply mods or most skins to it, though.  Find the Overseer's Cache in Morgantown Airport for the Small Backpack plan.
---
Crops are incredibly expensive as well. I've completely removed them all now.
---
Gave my second copy away in the spirit of Christmas.
---
On higher level yes. Really sad because they don't look great.
---
Keep it simple 2x3-2x4, stick with themes that could actually go in the place. Kitchen, nuka cola sign. Bed, poster, bookcase, dresser. I’m saying you shouldn’t have plants on top of your bed or a raider sign in a kids themed room. Just try to make it look like it could belong there. I still have my 2 bedroom, 2 stories, kitchen, living room, and a spare room all in just 2x3. You don’t need a mansion.
---
$55 K  in 10 months? I can quit my job and sell weapons for this kind of money.
---
To add to your comment:
---
That Radscorpion spawn at Top of the World is not common. I'm camped at the junk site just south of there and I go there practically everyday for the various plans and mag pickups. That Radscorpion is there probably less than 10% of the time.
---
I don't think I've ever seen a radscorpion at the campfire tales event...
---
It's actually not too bad
---
So far, the power plants have been the best place to find the xmas scorched. Did a run early this morning. Had 6 at Poseidon. Five small and one regular gift but two 3 star ones. 
---
It was a good run. I get excited when I hear the jingling. 
---
I finally got the icicle lights and santa crash yesterday. Now, I'm going to have to redo my camp to make room for all of the goodies. It would have been awesome to get an increased build budget too.
---
The Blackout Paint for the handmades is Awesome, but I don't think it's available any longer.
---
That was my initial thought; I didn't have any in my list but shortly after posting I tried resetting and the update showed up. Was just worried that it had more to do with a ban code than anything else because I just bought a month of First membership when I booted up this AM. Thanks for the help tho, friend
---
That's good enough for me. I don't keep a flat numbers list or anything. As long as it's not similar to a turret or something, I can make it work.
---
P2W!!!
---
[Its there](https://imgur.com/a/0v4qHKj)
---
how the fuck does this not come up when you google "how to get a backpack in 76???" lol, i figured it had to have been added in like the past month or so, bc I somehow completely missed this at the time
---
What the heck man 😠😠😠😠😠😠😠
---
Assuming you can still make gifts after the event is over. It should work that way...but we haven't heard anything one way or the other.
---
Damn it, now people can get dirty water where I can't and beat me in PVP.
---
Tbh I should've just done that before I posted lol. Thanks for the help tho
---
Lol. I bought it and can’t find it in the menu to place. But thanks
---
I haven't removed or changed a single perk card. I have a combat shot gun kept in my stash just for this(until I get all the recipes from BIV). I head to Flatwoods &amp; kill some low level molerats &amp; ghouls. The hardest part for me was working out how to use VATS. I didn't realise I had to hit the space bar to make the critical shot once I had maxed the critical bar
---
Got my Plasma Grenade plans on present #1 that I made myself. 50k caps later, still no second plan. I got the Mine plan at some point, no idea when because I wasn't looking for it.
---
It came out a few months back. It’s the “small backpack”. It’s at Morgantown airport in the overseers cache.
---
But it was free and I still haven't bought any atoms
---
190k so far.
---
Yes. Unless you are hostile. Just fast travel.
---
They put the plans in the presents to make a big cap sink, I'm broke af rn
---
Just fast travel out of there
---
You might have to right scroll to see it listed under one of the other tables.  
---
Your welcome, sorry I didnt understand your question the first time.
---
I'M SO HAPPY WITH MY 1STER TENT. I did spend an insane amount if time making my own custom fireplace though only to have them release one a week later 😣
---
I mean bro... you have to adapt you feel me? Nightmare Before Christmas!!!   
---
DO IT!
---
That’s boring af tho mannn
---
I know right but as i've said before i've wait something like 4 days for see them so maybe other need to wait a bit longer or less.
---
I don’t wanna, I wanna break stuff ya know the fun way
---
Embarrassing.
---
Ok
---
You are so nice!  I could build a rifle range....
---
PC, but thanks!
---
No problem
---
Yeah it just replaced the regular one, didnt see an option.
---
Thank you!!
---
Aaaaaahhhh! Best day ever. Mike miner gauntlets are my JAM!
---
Mirelurk queen was my nemesis.  Had to get close, and dissolved every time....
---
Sorry for the question but pets? Im fairly new returning to the game and this is the 1st I've seen about pets
---
Yes the hat and beard are crafted separately from the suit. The hat made all my hair disappear.
---
There is a raider and a flat black skin, although I don’t think they are currently in shop.
---
Yeah, there are a lot less enjoyment killing bugs tho
---
ahh ok that actually sounds familiar, I think it did come out after I got the Scouts backpack, thanks!
---
Slow as hell though, just like the water pump. I never use mine (or the pump) for that reason. On characters with camps not near water I find myself just fast travelling to the Overseers camp to get water or cook stuff.
---
It would be nice if both those options provided water more quickly...I mean, I get it. It's a post apocalyptic world and we're supposed to struggle with resources,  especially at low levels, but it's painfully slow as is.
---
I used my FSSRW Candy Cane last year to beat wanted players to death, then sent them videos, it was hilarious from my perspective, but a few did not appreciate it.
---
I'll be doing the same this year with my BSS +STR Candy Cane.
---
I had an idea last year I would love to see someday; A JunkJet type weapon that shoots Christmas Cookies &amp; Candies that also leaves behind lootable ammo like the Harpoon &amp; Railway guns.
---
1000000% it's so hard to get back into fo4 because of this. 3rd person is so much smoother and less clunky
---
Yes! Things like that would be amazing
---
Do you still use the resource nodes? I ditched mine, not worth it... i also have no turrets, i just kill things or repair. Most people who visit take care of their adds anyways, when they don't the cost to repair is so insignificant it's not worth having turrets.   
---
Those 2 things alone will give you much more build space. But yeah, as more things come out, and as hours in game grow, space is becoming a serious issue. They'll likely be doubling it by Wastelanders. If not... well then they just don't like money, and are into strangling their monetary growth.
---
Minor issue, but you have a point.
---
Personally, none of those is of any interest to me because of the *SLOW* rate you can get water from them.  I looked at getting the sink if the collection rate was better than the pump, but alas they both pale in comparison to a puddle.  I'll keep my camp near a water source, thank you very much.
---
No free item.
---
Dyuam
---
This can’t be fake, can it??? 😂
---
It’s okay :) I know the error messages make me worry too lol I’m always like “what could I have done”
---
Just when I find a death claw gauntlet and scrap my wolverine claws
---
They are not hidden but you wont find it without taking less then 30 secs, if you dont have 30 secs to enjoy my build I dont want your caps... What I really want is you to see my camp and be inspired
---
He is right!
---
Oh don't worry. Keep supporting them and the loot boxes are just about to come in.
---
You cant.  You need the perk.
---
This is why they changed it. Orbital strike beacons used to still work. Idk if they still do
---
I'll give ya that up vote
---
And Leia is Luke’s twin sister. 😱
---
many different ways to play this game, different builds, chars, weapons etc 
---
you'll be fine no matter what
---
I'd say it's more than full time job for them (as in being online almost non-stop, juggling accounts and characters, running errands, scripting, etc), but yeah, it's hell of a money.
---
We all knew this going in... the very nature of how f'ing easy it is to mod their games... meant hackers... anyone into PvP is just punching themselves in the face with a game like this lol. Sorry but thems the hard facts. Like it or not. This is the tradeoff of having a highly modable engine, that has been this way for literal years, and is known for it...   
---
OH and yeah, couple that with babies first online title and we have a cheater filled nightmare for anyone even remotely interested in PvP.  When Rockstar can't do shit... do you really expect BUGTHESDA to? Come on man. Take SOME responsibility for your frustration lol.  You knew better.
---
OTOH, you can't spam-collect water from it, from what I understand, so it's inferior to the Water Pump.
---
I prefer my Rifleman build over commando because I like the 3k normal hits when Adrenaline gets running.
---
I will say this from experiance.   If you are not using a lever or a hunting rifle, you are better with Commando.  The semi auto rifles look great in theory, but the damage per hit is lackluster compared to the true sniper guns (Lever, Hunting, Gauss).  
---
If you like Handmades, Fixers and Combat rifles, Commando is the way to go.
---
Realistic
---
Yeah that's correct
---
kylo-ren kills han solo
---
Upvote given, what a disgrace of a game studio
---
Is like to buy this plan.  I’m having no luck finding it in gifts.  Still two weeks to go so there’s hope.
---
Keeping the buildings small and non-square.  Odd angles and corners actually give character.  It's easy to get stuck in the square and large gym mindset, but break it!  Embrace odd shapes :)
---
You can do multiple small buildings even. Just keep each building to a theme. I was playing with this concept so did some work underground.  You can see the draft video walkthru here: https://youtu.be/ceRROudfTGQ
---
I mean they really just need a zone in the mountains. I want an actual snow zone, with snow storms aplenty!
---
Ritual Bindings and the Cultist Hood or harness, Sturdy Raider armor, and the Armored Raider Mask
---
Yes, and it really sucks when you waste a Vats Crit with a BE Dragon standing 5ft from the SBQs face.
---
I thought you couldn't get deathclaws anymore. We are talking about the taming perk cards under charisma right?
---
I get a disease every time I log in. I’ve just accepted the fact that I’m constantly playing with a disease.
---
Yes. And you can still get deathclaws
---
I played for less than 2 hours (3 crashes and 1 disconnect btw) killing scorched and got plasma mine plan
---
"Martin, meanwhile, said he's never been banned. He estimates 80 per cent of his stock is duped (something he says is due to a spate of mass duping crazes previously flooding the market - claiming he's only been involved in later "more controlled duping"), and he's managed to avoid hitting the weight cap by spreading his inventory over 12 PSN accounts and 70 different Fallout 76 characters.
---
"Bethesda has never interfered with any real life currency trading ... simply because they couldn't care less," he added. "Bethesda is a multi-million company who I assume does not consider from my perspective sellers who are selling items and somewhat promoting their game."  
---
Hey Bethesda, do yourselves a favor and prove this guy wrong and show your community that you do care, because right now from where I am sitting it sure as hell looks like he is correct here.
---
I’ve had an issue lately where they can’t place my camp, but I’ll load into that world and there isn’t another camp in my spot. I don’t get why that happens.
---
Oh shit, I could have sworn they made it so you can't get deathclaws, mirelurk Kings and sloths
---
By your logic there is no "game" state too once you finish the last quest. Nice brainwashing you had done there, making you believe it's p2w only if it's pvp. By your logic, chinese gacha games are not pay to win since they are not competitive.
---
I don’t think it starts until later today - not sure what time
---
For me it did work fine on PS4 . Anyone else is having issues?
---
yeah so i should just let the game die in a fire lol... nahhh, i'm good. Your rage culture around this game is overblown af anyways. Stop watching youtubers farming rage.
---
The beard is included? I didn’t see it shown in the preview image.
---
It’s not
---
I can confirm you can still get deathclaws and sloths. Guy above said you can still get mirelurk kings so. There was confusion before tho, a weird patch made it to where you have to be super close to the deathclaw/sloth to tame it. Not sure if that's been fixed. Try getting closer to the random encounter
---
BUT, you *can* buy skins for the backpack before you have it. I bought the shovel backpack skin about a month before I got my pioneer backpack.
---
I don't need to watch YouTubers to rage, I feel the rage every time I play and shit's broken.
---
Re equip ur weapon and it should fix it
---
the only reason I have turrets at my camp is to help me kill the sheepsquache that spawns behind my camp from time to time. my spot is a hot spot for random mobs
---
I thought it was a heavily modified Cadillac sedan.
---
Rule 1 of online game creation: never trust the client.
---
Sweeeet mirelurk king for sure, I hate fighting those, would rather take on a deathclaw anyday
---
No one gave Bethesda the memo. Apparently, those things you worry about when making an actual game, not a cash grab.
---
The rocket only takes off when destroyed. Not interactive I’m afraid.
---
And as with any other item in bot vendors, prices are affected by charisma perks: hard bargain and foods: grape mentats, alcohol, etc.
---
Yep, that's exactly what happens. To avoid it, I always make sure to have no more for sale than 20,000 caps worth of stuff, and I always burn caps on something to keep myself below 10K
---
Ive tried to get back into but this stops me everytime
---
Whaaaa....well shit. that pic of it is misleading then
---
Upvote because this is useful! It’s nice to see someone posting something useful so we can see snapshots of what is available instead of waiting 5-10 minutes to load the game. (Preemptive: yes I know 5-10 min is not long but it saves time none the less)
---
Yes there was a bundle including both outfits. The elf outfit had its own bundle.
---
Steel grating floors cost less space than wood, and if you lay down a floor, then change the texture, it counts extra. So lay the proper texture the first time.
---
Lately AAA games really becoming stupid "games" they are just there to your money and offering nothing good back.
---
Beside Outer world, Borderlands 3, I don't see other game companies that listen to their players. (I don't know all of them of course they could be a lot good games too)
---
I remember that behavior since day 1.
---
Is there a reason you are only buying from shady websites?
---
The original one from last year just changed the icons now they have a snow effect when you emote so up to you. I got it and i like it so.
---
&gt;Hey Bethesda, do yourselves a favor and prove this guy wrong and show your community that you do care, because right now from where I am sitting it sure as hell looks like he is correct here.
---
he is correct and bathesda dosent care :)
---
Paradox does an excellent job catering to their player base. They have been adding updates to CK2 since 2012: that's commitment!
---
Because it just works?
---
I don't think those are shady websites. My friends usually buys their games from these sites and I've already done that a couple times without any problem. Besides, the game was 11.85€ there :D
---
&gt; Bethesda: for Wastelanders please remember to actually release it.
---
FTFY
---
Sorry to break it to you but &gt;!Han shot first!&lt;.
---
Lol my thoughts exactly. First time seeing it so I kinda panicked😅
---
...Is it bad I keep 6 of each "booze" in my Stash? Simply remove 2-3 (I can have issues with time, too), then restock when time isn't an issue.
---
Im talking about the place, Fleetwood
---
You can use the rug glitch to make VERY clean wiring (or at least have the ugly backend stuff out of sight).
---
To wit, I have my generator on the ground floor connected to rug glitched advanced connector fairly near, with a wire going through to the ceiling of the second floor. Then that connector goes to a rug glitched power pole in my rooftop greenhouse.
---
The result is basically a set of invisible or just barely visible wires in each corner of the building with all the ugly stuff (powering vendor machines and whatnot) behind walls on the first floor. Super clean and very cheap compared to trying conduits.
---
It appears to have started.
---
So the trick is to just name my program definitelynotacheatengine.exe
---
You know what grinds my gears? When people don't give credit where it's due... look i was there day one... i complained LOUUUUUDLY for a loooong time lol. 
---
I quit for months, got back around Halloween and not even a FRACTION of the bugs exist, free stuff is being handed out in the atom shop on nearly a weekly basis... people bitched about it being just avatars, so they gave us wallpaper... they gave us a santatron and people now bitch that we got nothing free this week lol. 
---
You people are impossible to please, and you NEVER, EVER, EVER give credit where it's due... you ever have an asshole for a boss? You know the type... always points out your faults, never appreciates your efforts... so you just say "screw it" and go into minimal effort mode because the prick doesn't notice your efforts anyways? That's you right now... 
---
Don't be that guy. They've come a long way, and they've been doing good lately. Be rational or you're not going to be taken seriously by the adults in the room. 
---
Happy Holidays.
---
Less reputable "Grey market" sellers can be selling stolen or duplicated codes, that in no way supports the devs.
---
Stop being cheap, and buy from a reputable seller.
---
It seems to me these players would be easy to identify and delete their accounts at the very least.
---
I know players who have purchased in game items for cash, which seems stupid to me, but it's the sellers they need to go after.
---
I believe you can blame Sony for that.  The way it installs a package it does a lot of backups/copying, and that is beyond Bethesda.
---
Woo! That's freed up some build space 😄👍
---
Thanks for this. 
---
I'll probably only get the fireplace, the rest is just some shit I won't use for the other 11 months of the year, just like the Halloween stuff
---
You could build just a single small generator to power just one vendor machine and that would broadcast your location without needing to worry about more for lighting. If you're into that sort of thing ;)
---
Curious how you got this source code?
---
I thought there was.
---
 what do you mean with "reputable seller"?
---
Juuuuuunk
---
I have been mostly playing on a private server lately.   It's liberating.  😉
---
Literally any retailer, or non-shady dealer?
---
Wow, Fallout 76 could become great if they really want to too...
---
I had to add the Christmas trees of course 
---

As someone very new to the game that link was really useful as it led me to find Mappalachia.  That should make finding key materials a whole lot easier!
---
In the pics for the Mole Miner gauntlet, the toon is wearing an Elf costume.  I'd assume it will be coming available eventually as well.
---
Is this going on on console? I have yet to find one of this super duper legendary weapons.
---
How did you want me to know that g2a or instant-gaming were "shady dealers"? The only dealer I know sells the game for [58 fucking euros](https://www.pccomponentes.com/fallout-76-pc) and I only had 13€ on my bank account.
---
I had an issue where my 1st character couldnt craft even the small pack....its bc when he went thru Morgan town there was No backpacks yet. If ur older characters cant make a backpack go back to the morgantown airport overseers stash, the recipe is in there !
---
You clearly haven't played long enough to notice the bugs then. No one gives a shit about their "free" stuff. Burying your face in the sand and pretending everything is fine only makes the problem worse. Do you know how long PA was broken? 3 months: 90 % of the time you exit the PA, the game would freeze. In those three months, they added repair kits and scrap kits. And that's just one example. Look, the hatred is not unreasonable. No one has a fucking agenda against the game. The free blue wallpaper does jackshit if the game doesn't work most of the time.
---
Dude Paradox releases a skeleton and makes you pay for every asset they add to it
---
Exactly.
---
It's  pretty shitty that they sold the Red rocket sign by itself for 1400 atoms (which I bought) then later release a red rocket bundle for 1200.  No, this is not a matter of me choosing to buy the sign instead of the bundle, The bundle did not exist when I bought the sign.   Not sure if any bundles existed. It's been about a year ago when I bought it.
---
If I had gold I would give it here
---
Can't wait for YongYea and the other youtubers to blast this.
---
Is this how its setup when you place it, or can you choose between regular and Christmas themes?
---
they really need to debundled the rocket sign sht.  That bundle has been returned 3 times now and it never de-bundle!!!!!!  
---
I have all the pieces but that tower! Don't want to buy bundle price for the tower, seriously....!  
---
=/
---
Kotaku posted an article about hackers adding NPCs into the game, which had a link to the hackers' forum. So I went there and started reading their "research" right from BETA and came across this gem.
---
It has a proper Christmas tree!! I do think they should have given that to everyone but I'm glad I am a 1st subscriber. Can't wait to get home and check it out.
---
After today's patch it's gotten better, but it's still slightly noticable
---
I live on a river, so I can spam dirty water faster than any of the fountains.
---
5 star is possible, since they added the effects some months ag. Still unobtainable in game and probably used a third party software or dev room, but not necesarrily game breaking as the photoshopped handmade.
---
Ummm
---
https://imgur.com/a/9cZLGgx
---
Anyways, i'm sure now i play "too much" and i'm just a fanboy. I didn't bother to read past your strawman about my playtime. Take care dude.
---
Lame.
---
I'm waiting for the convince bug now to happen where most players lose their accounts.
---
Knew this was a joke when the title said bethesda and fix
---
 Never used it, so no problem at all. Always seemed like a cheat to me and I am death warmed over, so why would I need a cheat. ;)
---
Nice read, thanks for the link.
---
The sellers only \*claim\* they made 20k, and the author is justifiably skeptical (as am I).
---
And asking $60 for strangler heart power armor, I really hope for the guy they were duped for that low price and they didn't grind for it! Then they'd be better off working at McDonald's :-P
---
Anyone have the Pic? It was removed.
---
actually some pretty fun items in there this week!
---
What platform? I'd be intereted in buying any that I don't currently have.
---
They changed a lot recently though. Surviving Mars, Imperator Rome, Surviving the Aftermath etc. have been pretty good since release and the base game gets consistent good overhauls and updates, with DLC being truly DLC and not essential features. Hell, even CK3 will contain almost all features from CK2 and all its DLC. Stellaris has had major overhaul to its base game as well and all big mechanics update are added to the base game for free. CK2/EU4 had this problem you mentioned, but they changed a lot over time. Even now, base CK2 is pretty content rich. Morevover, Paradox puts their DLC bundles on very frequent, hefty sales (once every 1.5-2 months) where you can get the DLC for 70-80% off. So it's sowhere near as scummy as daddy Todd.
---
Yeah i love that tree... and those lights. The soft bulbs. My wife went nuts, and now she's hoping they go on sale soon. I told her it's likely they will. I'm sure they'll sell the tree, and that bottle... that bottle gives me hope for the Nuka bottle in the frathouse! That thing is really nice, and people been asking for it since summer. With this holiday variant, i'm sure its coming eventually now.
---
I own the sink and can confirm that you can spam collect by drinking, then spamming the collect button.
---
Glad the new stuff is reasonably obtainable without buying Atoms. One fireplace coming right up!
---
You literally just said you didn't play for a long time. Which means you missed many of the bugs that were breaking the game in between.
---
I've been saving the good low-level legendaries I've been goinging to gift to some newbie also. So far there's a quad pipe revolver, and armor-piercing combat knife, and a 2* zealots laser pistol. I'm probably not going to go public until after Christmas event though, that way wherever I go to farm scorched hasn't been cleared out already.
---
Wait, the gifts give something other than 500 cat and dog head mount plans? -.-
---
I'm on XB1. Would be happy to sell any that aren't already promised out. Won't be on for a bit though.
---
But not untrue
---
That's a very good level up weapon
---
Ahh...PC here. Good luck!
---
well played though imo using legacies and teslas are in the same category.  I've had people call me out for using a tesla vs a legacy and I'm just like wtf bro, at least I'm using a weapon that can be obtained.  
---
That said I prefer non stealthboy, non tesla non legacy pvp but it's rare to find other players with similar mindsets :(
---
That’s a smart idea! Thanks for the suggestion!
---
PC only.
---
You can switch between the normal tent and this one.
---
Talk about santa claws😂
---
sad face
---
Sweet, I'll swap mine out later.  I have it parked near Morgantown airport currently.
---
So it was a fake. I don't know what to believe anymore, I don't like this fake news age.
---
Well, I stand corrected if that's the case.  I don't own it.
---
Looks like something additional to the armor/reload bug.
---
Essentials for crafting gifts
---
This, give/ sell to people making alt accounts or storage accounts
---
I farm as what else is there to do?
---
It's slower than collecting straight from a river, but possible.
---
That was a great video 😂😂👌👌
---
It’s me, I don’t think I worded it well. I’ve looked under the table bit and scrolled through but can’t see it.
---
I like to kill things, helps me get my anger out. Not IRL of course
---
Betherapist:
---
&gt;10* legendaries arent real. They cant hurt you
---
I used to watch Yong but he's become quite a negative nelly so I un subbed
---
6 and 8 are lame, make them different
---
I’m no good at waiting.
---
Well, now you only have 1.15, and no working game.
---
Congrats?
---
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
---
I've had it drop twice, sadly though I don't remember the gift size.
---
Only way to get it otherwise is a player vendor or the market.
---
I can't say I really "farm" Legendaries, in that I don't really go out of my way to find them anymore.  I just gather up Scrip and when they have a Purveyor sale, spend it all, only spending Scrip in between sales to keep things below 1,000.
---
Ever since their introduction, player vendors have been a far more productive way of gaining Legendaries.  Why take a roll on a single 3\* Legendary when you can visit a CAMP and find a dozen rolls?
---
The data transfer rate on the Xbox internal drive and motherboard are intentionally slowed down to prevent overheating. This is a small part of the reason why Gen 1 Xbox 360s had the Red Ring of Death often. Microsoft learned their lesson this time around but gave the option of external drives due to the USB 3.0 on Xbox One having a faster data transfer rate than the actual internal system.
---
Add a ssd and you have a system that loads games quicker. Also helps  reduce lag in online games like Overwatch and Halo just a smidge.
---
always appreciate and look forward to these posts!  Thanks for doing this!
---
Its only a spoiler if you still care about Disneys cash grab version of Star Wars.
---
It is worth it sometimes if you have script available or free stash space till script resets. That's the way I do it cause my drops suck in game but if I save script the purveyor has been decent towards me
---
Destiny (twice) with Diablo and WoW on their side. Pathetic.
---
Yeah I hear you....to many sanctions for doing it in real life :)
---
The skull mask is very mediocre at best, got mine the first time around and it removes any facial hair etc. Looks really cheap when wearing compared to the pics they show, it's okay but I was pretty disappointed by it.
---
STFU.I didn't ask for help to be criticized by some assholes.
---
I wish there was an "Invite" function so badly. I like to use my private server for farming and playing with friends and its always such an "oh....... ok" moment when I go to an event and some random person I did a trade with 6 months ago is just chilling on my server. I don't want to set it to "Team Only" because I have teammates that come online at different times and I want them to be able to join.
---
Yep learned it the hard way, lol.
---
How much are the plans going for? I’ve got 10’s of the regular mounted heads clogging my characters carry weight
---
Lag is largely due to internet connection speed but having an ssd does help improve it just a bit.
---
I guess it could be, but you don't get access to key Bloodied survival perks until well beyond Lv. 5.  You're basically stuck with Lone Wanderer and Serendipity.
---
Just to specify for others reading this, i quit around July, came back mid October. This guy is going to find a million and one reasons to try and prove me wrong in the court of public opinion... he'll refuse to see any sort of reason, because it means he has to concede.  
---
Anyways, i'm enjoying the game right now, and i think 1st is worth having if you enjoy it too. People know what they do and don't like, we don't need others to tell us, and we don't need to organize some sort of strike. Bethesda either continues to improve this game, or we go elsewhere. Capitalism at its finest! God bless.
---
I received one, no clue what size package.
---
I remember a man I traded with months ago, I wanna say in March. I had to fast travel to him, up in the Savage Divide. He said he'd gone over his weight limit on the very first day of the game's full launch and was encumbered ever since. He just walked everywhere and picked up more shit, trading what he could. I think about that dude sometimes and wonder if he's still at it, somewhere in the Savage Divide.
---
Haha selling gifts. GG fam
---
There are only a few perks you need for a Bloodied heavies explosive build. 
---
Heavy Gunner, Expert and Master, all at rank 3
---
Blocker and Bullet shield at rank 3
---
Demo Expert 5, Nerd Rage 3, Stabilized 3 (stabilized is most important)
---
Bloody Mess 3
---
Everything else is just flavor, you NEED these to be effective, you also need to be in PA to make heavies viable.  You will lose too much accuracy and AP if you do not use Stabilized in PA.
---
Got 2 thus far.
---
&lt;3
---
I got it from a Large Handmade Gift
---
I guess they counting the santa-tron twice :(
---
right?
---
Ewoks are just short Wookiees!
---
Same. I love having a workshop and some rando I made serums for free forever ago pops up and kills me. I’ve had to unfriend and block 5 people so far. Which isn’t bad but still dumb.
---
How great, some fucktards started downvoting my comments without providing any argument. Fucking pricks.
---
I was at an antique store and it took all my willpower not to grab every old desk fan.
---
So your opinion is, lay down, lick Bethesda's feet and don't complain. Got it.
---
No wonder more and more companies think they can get away with producing absolute garbage, with "players" like this.
---
On a console no. On a pc it’s going to depend on your motherboard. Newer motherboards are going to have the capability for higher data transfer rates for hard drives. Ssd’s can load quicker due to less lag from not having any moving parts.
---
Those glasses are dope! Im mad i didn't get a chance to cop those!
---
It's a console thing to help smooth over some stuff from last week's hotfix. That's all.
---
Awesome! Do post an updated picture!
---
You’re on Pc right? I’ll try to visit later
---
I totally agree.problem is once people get dusted with handmade,they usually end up pulling energy weapons out.if you ever want friendly PvP with just ballistic let me know!
---
I got one, too! I cannot remember the size of the gift...
---
Excellent.  Got it.
---
I wish I could change the color of it to match myself in real life, and I wish there were kilts in the game.  But for now this is as close as I can get...  https://i.imgur.com/51c0mjj.jpg
---
I’m sorry, but &gt;!Paladin Danse is a synth!&lt;
---
I'm just peeved it isn't boiled or purified water. Drinking from it will give you a disease
---
I will likely buy the entire responder bundle that was datamined.  Otherwise I like to pick and choose specific pieces.  They really should have lots of different things each week to appease everyone along with the themed bundle.
---
Cool I doubt I'll be on today again but I'm normally on 8-9pm GMT most days
---
Yea I agree I rather pay a flat fee then deal with loot boxes like ESO. 
---
I just wish they changed the atom shop once a month for like 80% of it's inventory, so there would be more time to earn atoms to get what you want instead of the weekly rotation.
---
Do what Bethesda did to get you to buy it... Lie to them..
---
Mine is the same and I have a very good internet speed. The copying takes ages compared to the download. Believe it’s something to do with backing up. Frustrating as “small” update takes an hour plus. PS4 player
---
The daily/weekly challenges seem to be better lately as well. I've been getting 3-4 of them pretty easily lately, instead of just 1-2. My atom balance has noticeably improved lately.
---
The slow rate sucks but makes sense. Ever fill a gallon bottle from a drinking fountain? Slow AF. I almost never build my camp away from water though because of how much the pump sucks. If I do then I try to post my tent near water.
---
Cool thankyou
---
Cool. Thanks!
---
+karma
---
Does anyone know if getting the full 150 instead of leaving 1 or 2 in there.. gets a faster reset??
---
Oh yeah , they sure do run in teams now . As if it wasnt bad enough fighting solo cheater's , now we get to battle teams of four .
---
I have to agree.
---
Where is Blocker or Bullet Shield.
---
Thru Hiker and Adrenaline instead of Action Boy and Dodgy is just silly for a PA build, you would be better with AB and Dodgy and 2 in adrenaline instead of 5. 
---
OGA is situational at best.  If you are not killing something in 4 or less hits, then OGA isnt going to be a big help anyway, 
---
No Serendipity (what kind of bloodied are you without this)
---
No Class Freak
---
Radicool would be better than Good Doggy if you are looking for a filler end perk.
---
This is half food build.
---
One out of every 1-200 legendaries will be at least "good" meaning you can use it or sell/trade it.  One out of every thousand plus will be amazing.  
---
So the only way to get something good or amazing is to get a metric fuckton of legendary items.  And the only way to get a metric fuckton of legendary items is to farm them, scrip the trash, and spend your scrip at the purveyor.  
---
In this way, eventually, you will obtain the gear you want including god tier items.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/aehWV5v hopefully this one works, it made it private for some reason, so I just reuploaded it.
---
:0
---
time to start a new melee character :P
---
Same here! Hopefully, Bethesda will continue on this streak, because I’m enjoying the new content they’re adding in place of Wastelanders.
---
It makes sense I've looked up Legacy's before to see what they even were(back when I was new) and saw people selling them for $60 a piece. You can also buy caps from 1-30k, junk items, etc. It's fucking crazy
---
you are killing low level legendaries on the west side of the map.
---
Scrip fodder at the train station, or be nice to a newbie.
---
When I first started, someone gave me a L5 (instigating or furious, I don't remember which) fire axe.    
---
Used that until I found a L20 vampire machete.....
---
Picking perks around their effectiveness was likely the reason why my character ended up being a melee.
---
No worries, I’ll add you, same IGN as here?
---
I don't have the time in my day to actually dupe or be complicit in duping, but I'm not surprised that it exists. It's existed in every game that allows it. Key word being ALLOWS, because you can patch out those exploits. You can know your codebase and architecture well enough to fix it.
---
What's surprising isn't that an "aspect of the community" does this, it's that Bethesda has done nothing. Hell, even Rockstar has fixed duping issues consistently. An NPC in RDR2 even makes fun of dupers from GTAV in a cryptic one-liner, a vision about white cars in a room but no one is happy about them.
---
Does anyone know if they’ll be putting the elf outfit in the shop? That’s the one I’m reeeally gunning for.
---
Thanks all!
---
Stay crouched. It seems to have an affect on the mob spawn rate
---
Like the guy from ESO (I forgot his name but he's a kinda major character I think
---
This made me feel so much better after I lit a test engine above him after knowing him for 5 min.  Prolly explains why he took a rocket flame right to the dome only wearing the BS good.
---
Just because you can doesn't mean you should.
---
I realize that the lack of action on Bethesdas part absolutely fuels the practice, but it is alsp up to us as a community to do the right thing, in this case not absuse exploits.
---
I still watch but yea you are right. Being negative is just more profitable now.
---
Still waiting for those Mosaic floors to return.  A little disappointed they weren't included in last weeks "greatest hits" section.   Hopefully they return soon, I mean, they are a pretty sought after piece for anyone who missed it, so if not during the holidays then when else?
---
I keep an eye on the RMT market. It's super interesting. Most expensive legendary I ever saw sell was a BE/reload fixer for $250. Strangler PA sells for $150-200 all the time. Those are kinda outliers though. Most sales are junk/ammo/caps for like $5 and sub $30 legendary weapons
---
Excess Adhesive (5)
---
Damn that’s too bad I have a bunch of the holiday themed cutouts too, sadly only on my Xbox character. Oh well I bet if you ask around someone could build them for you it’s not very many materials
---
Only get it when its free, they've literally broken every promise they've made...Don't support these assholes
---
I think you're on the wrong sub.
---
I don't think it would be that easy. Short of actually buying stuff and banning the accounts that deliver it, I don't know how they can tell. And even that wouldn't be very effective because people deliver on smurfs
---
I got one from the Medium Handcrafted Gift. It was on day one, in the second one I crafted.
---
dear God this sucks in West Tek when it would happen...!
---
I got two so far, they can drop from any size.
---
Dammit.  Thanks for the heads up.
---
I bought a bag a few days ago and was confused.  I assume this is the scout quest line.  I think I’ve done part of it.  Time to finish it.
---
Busy cooking the Xmas dinner!
---
Christmas what?  Your title isn’t too clear.
---
It had a sign on them that said limited time and a countdown on them.
---
Is the Santatron gone? 🥺
---
How big are the aluminum trees?
---
Dang. I assumed the counter was for the whole 14day event
---
I hear you there lol, i spawn the Mothman and the Flatwoods monster rather frequently out in the mire.
---
I'm eye-balling those aluminum christmas trees... I didn't play last year; it says it comes with 4 decorated and 5 undecorated but only shows very plain colored trees (assuming undecorated) with stars on top. What do the decorated ones look like? Lights? Balls? Garland? I'd like to know what I'm paying for...
---
I have zero knowledge of coding so I will just take your word for it.  I feel like there should be more, it looks rather rudimentary.
---
Turrets and crops are the biggest budget killers. It's display cases and the items inside them that kill most of my budget. I have 11x the 6-item display cases, 6x the -item display cases, 5 magazine racks, and the bobblehead display. XD
---
They do deliver on Smurfs, but Bethesda has the ability to log the IP address and could then Ban every account that had used that IP, I know this to be true based on comments made from their support group while helping me resolve an issue.
---
Unrelated but may i ask what kind of roof is on your door? Looks stunning and i have no idea how to do it..
---
Sorry.
---
Looks like decompiled code.
---
I've got that plan like 6 times now. Still no Plasma Grenade though...the search goes on. lol
---
Nah this is all there is. The point is, it IS rudimentary, otherwise I wouldn't have posted it.
---
Nope,i think its there till the new years
---
it’s just a collectron that you know collects junk and stuff
---
I think there’s more Xmas content that I like in the tent than in the whole Atom shop Xmas stuff
---
Yes, that's exactly what it is. This is their net attempt at stopping hackers.
---
🥳👍🙏
---
I thought the icicle light plans were dropped during the event? I have yet to find them and they are the only thing I really want from the event.
---
Displays have a lot of potential and catch my eye.  Otherwise it’s overall interesting designs (no box bases).
---
Same as in adventure mode.  On pc it's pip boy then "t" but whoever you access your perk cards on your platform the process is the same in NW.  
---
Protip: there's an option to view all unowned cards so you can see their cost to buy with overseer points.
---
Yeah they drop inside the presents. Just have to keep at it i guess. My wife got 3 sets... she's been killing it! But i mean... i drop my presents for her since she loves opening them so much lol.
---
Yep, I've got 2 so far.
---
That’s the Santa Collectron. There is an Anamatronic Santa statue that moves in some way, but since Atomic Shop are just photos you can’t see what it does.
---
I got 2 from 2 large gifts
---
Small gift.  From Camden park of all places while doing Lucky Mucker.
---
I respectfully disagree with everyone saying you MUST use PA for a Bloodied Heavy build. Yes yes, Stabilized is AA and obviously the most efficient for "Min-Maxing" But as a Mix-Maxer myself, I hate power armor! You can run a Bloodied Heavy gunner with a full unyielding+Sentinel set, put lots of points into Strength, Agility &amp; Luck. Mandatory to use Serendipity &amp; Radicool. Remember that Endurance is your "Dump Stat" (Keep it at 1) Make sure to put 3 points into "Blocker" (in Strength) &amp; don't forget that tool of destruction as well: I suggest a 50 cal or LMG. Rad-X Diluted &amp; RadAway will become your BFF's, but you may die every now and then to a miscalculation on your part. Without PA you're basically a Glass Cannon but one that can SOLO the SBQ... however for the SBQ I would still recommend PA, but that is the ONLY SITUATION where I'd say so. Keep a Chassis around for Scorched Earth and you'll do just fine.
---
So you're actually wrong. You act like you know so much but there's more to it than this but I'm not going to disclose exactly what because why the hell would I? Like I want to let more people use hacks than already do.
---
Lol this is literally pseudocode for if(isHacking){ban()}
---
I've been grinding the crap out of these scorched! haha. I have about 14 mounted cat and fox heads though! Ugh! Time to hit up Big Bend for the 1000th time! :)
---
I got it, keep an eye out on the market people will be putting them up, i know i will be soon.
---
They ARE incompetent. I just saw their anticheat code and I wantbto shoot myself in the foot. And I am not even a programmer by profession.
---
Atom store
---
You should do more research instead of relying on a post on a cheat forum that was inactive for a very long time
---
Honestly though. IMO the best things are the icicle lights, which I’m glad wasn’t atom shop.
---
that's the tesla bug.  Gotta relog to fix that.  It hasn't returned, it's been here for some time now.
---
1. What is the source of this screenshot?
---
2. You have some fucked up post history. Don't do it.
---
Yeah I’d agree with that!
---
Lel
---
If it's the same one as last year, it waves its arm and makes a creepy distorted "Ho ho ho" noise.
---
WHAAAAAAAAT?!?!?
---
You have just revolutionized my gameplay. I move my CAMP at least 2x/week, and the BIGGEST annoyance is having to repopulate and re-price all of my vending machines and bobblehead stand.
---
This is AMAZING. Thank you.
---
No ammo weight reduction armor? Does it for me...
---
Senedipidy dose not proc in pa. Thats what kind of bloodied build I am. A heavy gunner as op is. 
---
Dodgy makes it so I can't move a lot of the time, which mean I end up killing myself with my plasmas.
---
Since not running dodgy I don't need ab
---
Since running an exploding plasma as op is you need to be very aware of melee attackers so blocker is not very helpful. Also running lone wander r3 n emergency protocols I ignor 70% of dmg anyway
---
As for adrenaline and oga I run them as most of my time is spent farming the Queen. So I like keeping her on the ground and maxing my dmg. 
---
Why do i need extra str from radicool for guns? I've got over 100 pounds of extra weight any way
---
I don't not find the few stat debuffs bad enough to run class freak. I have not had any issues not running it for that last 70 lvls. (lvl 290)
---
Running in pa gives you a bit more room for qol perks I find. Which a lot of people like. And call it a crunch but running exploding plasmas and Bffr weapons I still completely obliterate the Queen and imposter. And very rarely die.
---
Ah ok, I wasnt playing this time last year. Thanks!
---
I've seen it too lmao
---
Is it the same “Ho Ho Ho” you faintly hear when opening the Christmas presents for plans? That one is kind of creepy.
---
That fact that this WAS all they had at launch is still laughable.
---
Nope. Also, on my other two characters, the card works fine.
---
Also, let us change to different vending machine skins without having to reload... I don't even fuck with the skins because I don't want to be bothered with reloading my stock.
---
I haven't been on in a while, what does the Santatron do?
---
Dude tell me about it. I was looking at a recipe video on facebook this morning and someone posted a cell phone picture they snuck at the premiere last night with a MASSIVE spoiler on it. I was like, man I was just looking for a new cookie recipe! I unfollowed pages that would potentially spoil me, but no where is safe!
---
oh shit when did they add that
---
Today with the Atomic Shop update.
---
I think it is, or some version of that.
---
The rng has mysterious ways.
---
The fucked up post history is because this was originally a throwaway account and I just started using it for Fallout. I could post the original source but it is a forum full of tutorials about how to cheat in NW, so that'd be pretty against the rules to post it here. It literally has all the cheats we see posted about here: walking in air, one shotting players without moving, shooting through walls, etc. I am 100% sure that's against the rule to post here.
---
Over a year later. You act like a lot of games don't have problems at launch. Or maybe you just want to incite more anger about Bethesda. Why not try to be more constructive about things instead of being entirely negative
---
See my reply to the person under you. I've been running this build for over 100 lvls, with some slight tweeking, and find it to be a great balance. I rarely die and absolutely shread everything.
---
It sounds like I am in a very similar weapon situation to op. Not sure how my build is shit when I melt absolutely every thing in the game. And don't have to spend all day managing my weight.
---
Agree very well put
---
Strange. As long  as it works I wouldn't complain though lol
---
How did you get source code?
---
That’s good to know. Thanks.
---
I'm confused did you literally just look at a post from November 5th, 2018 and then jump over to reddit claiming that was the anti-cheat? That was the anti-cheat as of a year ago, but since then it has been updated. You can literally find posts about what it does now on the very same forum. 
---
It is obviously still insufficient and imo Bethesda deserves critique in this category, but this post is pretty misleading. I would update this with the actual anti-cheat and critique them on that as it is still pretty lackluster
---
Its the laughter of todd howard
---
Have you modded the armor?  That may help.
---
IKR, but it’s driving me crazy that I can’t figure it out. 😂
---
fusion cores are also considered ammo, so may be affected WR armor for ammo....
---
I'm selling them at 1k. And selling.
---
Sorry, I meant as in what cards do people use!
---
Lol. 👍👍
---
I just want that blue and snowflake patterned suit.
---
Someone go ahead and make me some armor pieces with hacked +500 carry weight already
---
HMU
---
ö
---
Fml im gonna buy more atoms now.
---
I use VATS for unarmed and melee cause it's fun to jump off buildings and cliffs and have the VATS pull you down to the enemies and vs versa to have the VATS pull you up to enermies. I've noticed since the last two patches that I will be literally be on top of them and my hit misses 2 to 3 times or if I'm down at the queen and go to VATS the creature standing in front of me and the queen is behind me, it will swing me around and lock onto the queen.
---
Okay seriously, what's up with this sub's obsession with the anti-cheat all of a sudden? Like one week literally nobody was talking about it then all of a sudden this week there's dozens of posts saying how 'bad' the anti-cheat is, how Bethesda 'is a joke of a company' and how they suck big time etc etc.
---
Not to mention this is how it was a year ago, so as usual people on this sub are once again spreading around misinformation (that everyone else takes as 100% fact) just to start an uproar for literally no reason whatsoever
---
Yeah I highly doubt Wastelanders will magically fix everything. One of the biggest bugs in the game was the +250 DR bug, and after a whole year, they try to fix it and it ends up breaking *all* armors. Imagine what trying to add whole new areas will do to the game. Bottom line, they are a bit shit when it comes to coding, and if they actually do it well, *yay*, otherwise, *sigh* and lament the money you wasted on this shitshow.
---
Also, $10 on Wastelanders being monetized as shit, apart from being a buggy mess.
---
The abundance of VPNs and ways to shift your IP make this a moot point nowadays.
---
So, you *just* bought this game and have already decided to be a griefer?
---
Okay. Good luck.
---
Oh. Has anyone bought from Graham, is his wrapping paper better then any other vendor since he is hard to find?!?!
---
Everything is a cash grab
---
You, Me, &amp; so many others.....maybe next week who knows.
---
For those that haven’t read the comments, this code was shared on a hacker forum around the release of the game in 2018 and very well may not be used code anymore.
---
I agree with OP that this is shameful if it was truly their only anti-cheat measure, but a better way to have framed this post may be to criticized the developers for using it at all when we don’t know for certain that it is still relevant.
---
It literally does the same thing in more verbose code, and only manages to catch some blatant hack tools. Most of it is still useless compared to common commercial tools such as EasyAntiCheat.
---
ahh i’ll have to check it out when i get on
---
What kind of armor? Different armor types have different resistances available, and mods will increase those. A heavy metal piece with the polished mod will give the highest base damage resistance, but no rad resistance and poor energy resistance. Buttressed trapper armor has the highest base rad resistance, but poor damage and energy resistance. Studded heavy leather gives the best energy resistance, but poor damage resistance and no rad resistance.
---
If so, Bethesda really needs to stop releases holiday stuff literally days before said holiday. People like to be festive leading up to the holiday.
---
Because recently people started playing a lot of NW and encountered the greatest amount of hacking.
---
The afk inside bushes perk, works perfectly
---
Delete lights, turrets, display shelves, and some floors if you can.
---
The present code is very similar, and essentially just spells out the exe names in hex instead of plaintext. This adds some benefits when scanning memory, making the tools "next to useless", as opposed to"completely useless".
---
My turrets blast away at my santatron haha
---
Make sure nothing is in the stored tab.
---
ah it’s the santa from last year it just waves
---
Rule 2 - the less you trust the client the more lag is introduced.
---
*looks at 76 lag state*
---
yeah, self answer.
---
Yes! Let me also type in prices instead of using the scroll bar while we're at it! Also, let us modify prices in case we want to mark the cost up or down. 
---
Instead of cancel sale, scroll through inventory, find item, re-list... Oh crap, I accidentally posted the wrong price... *Cancels sale again...* Let me just click a button that says, "Modify Sale".
---
The hell? Two baseball bats now? Or a hammer to go with the sickle, and we can call him the Scorched Mr. Clean?
---
That is false in soo many ways.
---
I fully agree. They did the same thing with Halloween pretty much...not cool
---
I was going to say that. It promotes the game, and he made 50k but has spent more than I have spent.
---
Well.fo4 has a extremely bad glitch and still does where you edit in the first area and you get caught in an infinite loop of dying and cant play, ive never played fo4 past the first minutemen mission
---
You beautiful man. I'm in Australia but since this is common law i can use these precedents in the civil tribunal I'm going to next month against Zenimax. Thank you
---
I guess I can count myself lucky then, bought and crafted 42 medium Handmade gifts yesterday, the plasma grenade plans dropped on the last one I opened.
---
Yeah I wish I had a girlfriend so that I could spend time with her after work instead of having to play this shit game.
---
And that's ok? Shouldn't Bethesda have fixed that asap?
---
Scamming is not something Bethesda need to regulate. They arnt fucking with the game, its code or anything else that would violate their terms of use. 
---
They could change the trade system to give it more utility and make it safer ect but they don't need to fuck with players just playing the game.
---
I just learned a trick yesterday that someone else posted before. If you choose to drink, then during that animation you can spam whatever button you use to collect water. It's much, much faster. If I drink twice I'll get enough water to make my 20ish razorgrain soups.
---
Took me all of 15 minutes to do this. Most of it was thinking of the 12 items.
---
The rewards will never be enough to justify how awful the experience is doing the vault raid. I hate it.
---
Players like you are literally the reason camp objects are for the most part unbreakable.
---
If you consider mental health issues a “fucked up post history”, you need more friends.
---
It's used for making Strangler Armor.
---
They should have but they havent yet and that was discovered over 2 years ago and still happened to me 3 months ago, a bug or glitch that makes a game unplayable is where i draw the line and say definitely not ok
---
I got the fireplace.
---
Seriously man? Spreading misinformation then calling people white knights when they call you out on it really lowers your credibility. This is proven time and time again to be over a year old. I understand being disappointed and a bit upset about the game, I really do but this sort of behaviour puts you on the same level as the people you're trying to discredit. Try harder.
---
And Thorn and Solar scout armour
---
I've been swimming in Bloodied drops for the last month, nothing crazy god tier but still nice.
---
Except this guys info is a year old
---
Please add TLDR for TLDR.
---
I've got 30K set aside. Gunna wait until the last week if I haven't got it by then I'm loading up on paper
---
I wish they'd just fix the Nuclear Winter cheating...it's going to be painful playing it to try and get the new Christmas/Winter items :/
---
God I really hope we can become Bounty Hunters, if only for Bethesda to add something like the Regulators/Talon Company from Fallout 3 along with some sick outfits.  There is a severe lack of dusters in non-Atomic Shop gameplay.
---
Nah. I am not charging people $13 to read this. Ergo, they are worse.
---
The FO1 is way more pay to win than any major MMO I've seen in a while.  The unlimited junk stash thing is a ridiculous advantage to a game that has such a huge inventory problem it could be described as an inventory simulator.  
---
You should probably step back a moment because nothing you're saying is objective here.  The game is in a really sorry state when they took what would probably be the largest quality of life improvement in almost 2 years and locked it behind a $100/yr paywall.
---
It's one of the perks cards that lets you tame creatures
---
I'm not terribly familiar with UK law, but a lot of the assumptions listed here would fall flat in the US, and will likely fall flat in the UK.
---
Also, the case law is hilarious in some instances, and show pretty clearly that the person writing (who is only a student) needs a little more real-world experience.
---
where and how do I find this armor?
---
I wrote more complex code in middle school within a day
---
Except this info is a year old and out of date.
---
Lose my shit.
---
I didn’t downvote! I refuse to be a sheep 🐑 shed more light on this horrible situation! Fight the Galactic Republic! May the force be with you. Lol I just wanted to use those movie reference due to Star Wars coming out in a few days but we need to fight the system!!
---
I think a few People can understand prog langage.. But client side instrad of server one... Bring me some memory of d2 or even lineage 2 xd
---
The snide edits probably aren't helping you mate, your posting old as shit content without even as much as a source to back up any of your claims.
---
Don’t. It’s old info from last year from the beta
---
Show us the current anti-cheat.
---
How did you lose both gear and caps?
---
Uhhh, okay bud. Not entirely sure what the relevance of that is? I'm pretty sure the "white knights" you're demonising aren't either.
---
If its blue screen delete game and reinstall its not bethesda its memory fragmenting
---
People are saying this post is old but can anyone honestly say it's incorrect?  I mean I can't see any ways in which the cheating problem has gotten better over the past year.
---
I'm not sure the point of the doubters.  The cheating problem has absolutely gotten far, far worse as of late, especially with the advent of Nuclear Winter and now the dupes and hacked item drops plaguing the entire game.  
---
If their cheat detection is better than this pile of code crap-crap from a year ago, there's certainly no evidence of it.
---
Yes, its a great game, but after some point, there is nothing to do anymore, no content, the game become a    
---
economic simulation, nothing more.
---
The game lacks of Content.
---
After a year, they was able to bring out nearly nothing. Not even a Chat. Nuka-Shine questline, Pioneer questline, Vault 94...
---
It is NOT incorrect. The current new anticheat does the exact dame thing in a slightly different looking code.
---
Yeah and a lot of people are reeee’ing over it.  Kind of sad that people are defending something as egregious as this.
---
I tend to pull my hairs when i get good drop at low level, for that reason I haven’t farmed festive scorched in anywhere other than the borg area.
---
Make sure you equip tank killer too!
---
I’m personally a fan of verticality. I like the challenge of incorporating height into a build without it floating. 
---
It’s also fun to give the building a story. One of my camps is a ruined hotel with three themed guest rooms. Another is the “tomb” of my vampire character for instance.
---
So instead of the blacklist they used to use, it is now a whitelist, which seems just as easy to dupe.
---
While the survival tent is nicely decorated, I hardly ever see it. I would like more decorating for our camps as well.
---
It has a nice animation to it, but it sucks compared to get it out of a pond. It is a utility, but in the form of the Free water pump reskinned. It's not like the wallpaper or refrigerator that locks the unique use behind a pay wall.
---
Nope. Servers never went down in the first place
---
I guess my theory is that in typical Bethesda style, The fix in patch 15 just didn’t work so they fixed it in patch 16 and didn’t tell us.
---
So I just throw out all the flux I earned so hard doung Scorched Earth? Look I had just had this discussion, and there have been many posts here as well saying how having the scrap box frees up 300-400 lbs in your stash, it's not even a point of contention.
---
It's funny how apologists like you repeat the exact same arguments, almost as if someone came up with it and taught you to repeat it.
---
Lucky
---
Good for you.
---
Yeah, I was actually thinking the same thing as I was typing it up but at least it is extra content to play to keep players active.  Doing the same dailies and events from Day 1 is pretty stale.  That is why I believe these roles should have exclusive rewards to unlock so it is stuff players can works towards.
---
It’s all good will have liked to had a Mrs. clause outfit
---
What i do is leave a single Foundation piece and place my 3 vending machines on them and leave them up/unstored then move the camp. It will build a blueprint with the vending machines on the foundation piece and keep my items and prices. Then i place the blueprint (foundation makes this easy) and move them to their final location in the new camp. I gave up on a Full Camp Blueprint a long time ago so i just store everything (minus the Vendors) manually and rebuild it any time i move.
---
Spend your flux? Ofc having the scrpabox helps but you don't need, if your stash box is full, sell something , build something , the game doesn't encourage hoarding , and no im not some apologist your argument is just bullshit
---
Thank you!! Flipping outstanding!
---
I wondering why nobody had posted about it. I have the "Vault-tec engineers are hard at work getting our servers back online" message popping up and have done for the last 6/7 hours.
---
Update your game. Might have to restart console to get the update.
---
Try restarting your system and checking that your game has updated
---
Think its a 300mb update or something, its only a quick fix to revert the 250 dr "fix"
---
It encourages hoarding if youbpay for it. I could just put all my flux in a scrapbox and forget about it and sell it leisure. That's why they intentionally limited scrap storage. There was no engine limitation, just lies.
---
Remember to slot in the Chemist perk, twice the gifts from crafting.
---
Eso devs have no idea what they are doing. So many players have un-subbed while ZOS "re-balances" the game in the name of "performance". Sadly, things just went to absolute shit when they released the necromancer class, and further Elsweyr. Server performance was garbage, class identity was garbage, skill audits/balancing was alllll over the map to the tune of 50% buffs one patch, 80% nerfs the next. There are so many stupid bugs, like halfway into a 2 hour raid instance killing bugs out the wazoo. People being disconnected in groups, party finder crashes, AI break downs, etc. So no, they wouldn't be the best folks to learn from.
---
That's what makes it almost entirely inexcusable to me, I play both and to see the mismanagement with this game sucks man. I really like this game and want a turn around but at this rate it's becoming harder to see that ever happening. I'm fairly certain Wastelanders will be making or breaking this game for good, we'll see.
---
I always seem to catch a disease with that method but have yet to get one from a Stream by my camp.
---
Yeah ill admit that the stash is limited on purpose , but it's not that big of a deal and you dont need the scrpabox clearly if something is in your stash not being sold or used its just shit
---
Pc or console?
---
Santatron has been useful.
---
Martin was in a fb group I'm in selling guns. I asked him how much a tse Tesla would be (this is like 8 months ago probably) and he sent me a pic showing prices. Couldnt screencap it quick enough but they werent cheap.
---
Well at least Bethesda knows how to punctuate. That's the only complete sentence, thus the only one that should have a period.
---
I never noticed this and now I'm kinda impressed.
---
But it’s more fun than sitting in an office and dealing with bosses. Quality of life is important.
---
There is a responder skin for the X-01 PA, but I can’t see it in the store,anyone know something about this?
---
Junkies or Bloodied
---
Are you volunteering yourself?
---
There’s ways to set up a flamethrower trap and a switch to destroy it at will.
---
Console or PC? I think that is the hardest part.
---
See in the face of logic now your sentences don't make sense. Probably because Bethesda hasn't taught you a good response yet. Go back, you're just embarrassing yourself. The entire world isn't wrong. They k ow it's fucking p2w.
---
think christmas bulbs
---
You also get a guaranteed 2-star item automatically put into your inventory for competing the Scorched Earth event (scorchbeast queen fight)
---
Private servers are already broken enough as they are, I don't think anything from them can be representative of the "intended" game mechanics as a whole. I didn't spend money on that but I have seen reports that eventually legendaries just stop spawning there altogther. If that's true, there are definitely some background problems going on that could affect drop rates. 
---
Enemy levels are nothing new, the game loads in NPCs when you arrive somewhere and sometimes that's done before the game properly draws your character data and presumably treats you as a level 1 in terms of spawns. That has nothing to do with legendary item/effect drop rate seeding. Obviously you won't get a legendary handmade rifle from a level 6 legendary because their minimum level is 15, but that's still a problem only with spawns and not item drops.
---
Nobody knows for sure except for the devs (and with half the things in this game even the devs have no clue what they're doing anyway), but there have been a few people tracking thousands of legendary drops across servers and never found any statistical evidence pointing towards server seeding. I used to keep track of a few hundred drops and got the same results. There are some very arbitrary factors in place (i.e seems like left arms/legs are more likely to drop than right ones, or vice versa) and as a whole some effects (like quad) are much rarer than others. But as far as I am aware nobody has yet tested this with all of the existing factors in place (i.e quad might just be rarer because many guns can't have quad on them).
---
The fact that people see "streaks" is most likely just a logical fallacy. You get the same effects multiple times in rapid succession once, call that a server seed, and ignore the next 19 times that doesn't happen.
---
&gt; It's almost as if they just slapped a few mods onto Fallout 4 from Nexus and sold it as the game. 
---
That's literally what they did. It's FO4 Online
---
The math... (3 x 10) + (6 x 5) = +60% damage for max rank in all three levels of a weapon perk.   
---
For fun (and PROFIT!) add Bloody Mess \*\*\* to get you to +75%.  
---
(and later, Adrenaline, Tenderizer and some anti-armor perks for even more FUN!)
---
PVP is Commando Sneak Sniper using Anti Armor
---
PVE is either  Bloodied Sneak Rifleman, Commando or MeatHook
---
I have 1500+ hours and love this game, yet even I admit that oversights and lack of common sense are a common recurrence from the developer. So it is odd, but quite normal relative to how they’ve operated 76 since beta.
---
My heart breaks every time I see one of these and it starts to jingle when I get closer.
---
It does, I love watching my my car slide through the snow or my character shiver because they're cold, and definitely the snowball fights.
---
Ah yes. I suppose that would cause mad issues if you were in your scrapbox menu and then someone’s camp knocks you out of it... I’m sure there’s a way around that. Proximity, like you said, sounds good.
---
I don’t think so since according to another comment on here it’s 20 hours after your first exchange
---
You seem like a spiteful and unintelligent human.
---
Camps also can’t be placed if the game detects a player in the area as well. I’ve loaded into a world without my camp and found no structures anywhere around, but a player in the nearby vicinity. 
---
On topic, however, I think ‘First Come, First Served’ is the only way to be fair.
---
There's an end boss that isn't a wendigo? Seriously? I've done that dozens of times and always see the wendigo.
---
RNG is a bitch sometimes...lol.
---
What be free?
---
PC Master race dude
---
On ebay their about 50$.   I bought one just to have it.  Damn thing is creepier irl
---
I understand where you're coming from. But definitely with enough voices we can make it happen and if they try to charge for a more immersive experience in a troubled game we as gamer can screw them over and step on the foot they just shot themselves in again and support the modding community who is more than happy to fix Bethesdas mess.
---
When i first encountered a scorched leader in that suit i really wanted to take its clothes instead of the large gift.
---
It's a symptom of shit coding, just like all the bugs.
---
There is a Mrs claus outfit just put on the chef clothes 😉 just kidding! Yeh hopefully they add female Santa /elf outfit next
---
You seem like a very intelligent person so keep it to yourself.
---
If I understand it right, the recent hacking issue is more of a server side issue, though, rather than something related to anti-cheat on the client? In theory, entity spawns and inventories should be entirely server based. I wonder how the hackers managed to spawn items in a way that they do not only appear on their own clients? I guess it must not be easy or simple, otherwise it would not have taken a year for this kind of hack to appear. Maybe it exploits some security issue in the network protocol used by the game, or there is a hidden debug functionality (similar in purpose to the developer room) for creating items that has been now discovered?
---
Even if you change "Cheat Engine" to "lolokwtf", it will still show up as CheatEngine.exe in the taskbar, so you can't just "prevent getting banned" from just changing the name of something.
---
And when holiday gets everyone busy fewer people will actually buy them before they’re gone until next year.
---
Where did you see it? Perhaps you could post a link to it or post the picture itself?
---
At the weekend I was using the stash box inside a camp as it dematerialised.  I could tell because of the sound and the background behind the stash menu changed, but it allowed me to continue in the stash box menu until I was done (despite there no longer being a stash box near me in the game world).
---
So you don't appear to be knocked out of the menus you are in, even if the camp disappears literally beneath your feet.
---
Been away for a few months and for me it was TSE then and now that I’m back for me personally, I have a TSE shotgun and still favor a non legendary sniper rifle over the shotgun, I’ll only pull out the TSE when in dire situations like when my rifle breaks.
---
They seem to operate by the same logic as the Christmas lights and other props like that do.  You can't directly attach them to the side of a wall.
---
That's how it works right now, but it's still easy to bypass it. The website I got it from gives details.
---
If I have to explain why ruining someone else's playing time so you can have fun is a dick move you aren't going to get it anyway.
---
Plague Walker!
---
7pm est I believe
---
Just out of curiosity, did you delete this posts text or was it removed by mods/bots?
---
Great idea, but that would require Bethesda to hire someone to implement the code. BETHESDA DOESN'T SPEND MONEY FOR YOU, YOU SPEND MONEY FOR BETHESDA!!!
---
Mine required an update earlier and has been running fine since
---
Build tall tower, place santatron or bramin on top. Place spring loaded traps on floor or walls, launch robots or cows into space. Also fun for head start leap off of your camp. Especially with bird bones mutation.
---
Looting someone’s base in a game where that is 100% possible and practically encouraged (plus lore friendly) isn’t ruining someone’s game. I see that the player base really fell flat like the game too god (before you say it’s not encouraged lockpicking allowed on doors and chest/ containers is obvious)
---

---
You got scammed but the scammer is the idiot...  Too bad they don't have machines people could sell things through that would eliminate that kind of stuff...
---
Send me your account name. Do you like PVP? I used to until I saw all these 5 star legendaries.
---
&gt; But, if the Battle Royale mode catches on then that changes. Suddenly teleporting and aimbotting become a problem and people are going to cheat more. And if that happens, Todd Howard is going to need to step up the anti-cheat game if he wants to keep the game full of legitimate players that enjoy playing the game.
---
oops
---
Yeah, but the TENT is one big object.  We don't "get" the tree or other things for use at our CAMP.
---
A while ago, I built CAMPs for both my characters around existing trees.  This worked out pretty well for Christmas, because I can decorate all around the tree.
---
Tesla explosive is the problem. Kinda like shotgun explosive bug where your freaking out the server. With I/E double barrel it's mostly ok but if the server is stressing I get the rubber band damage.
---
TLDR: server can't compute some crazy weapon combos.
---
Bethesda coding never changes
---
Thank you!❤️
---
I didn't know about that,  thanks!
---
IS THAT YOU TODD HOWARD!!! YOU WILL SPEND TO KEEP US, OR WE SPEND TO PLAY FORTNITE!
---
Did you have any luck getting them? I’m having the same problem. Hoping it’s just an, “it takes time” before it shows up. I have the accounts linked and showing that the loot was claimed but I’m not seeing it anywhere in game.
---
Yup!
---
That’s the one!
---
I do have it available. Time to go blend in with the Scorched.
---
Not all skins work on all armors. Are you sure Prime can be applied to Raider?
---
They are ... Evolving.
---
Completely agree with you. I think they are all awful; so happy I am not delving back into NW for these!🙏🏻
---
Sell them
---
Jingle bells and presents.
---
I did! I noticed it a bit later. However, I only saw the sleeping bags and I haven’t checked if everything else was there yet.
---
Of course there’s a reason. But considering you can’t be at a very high level yet, and haven’t gotten a true feel for the in-game community, you’re choosing a challenging and antagonistic path. 
---
But, you do whatever is fun for you. I’m sure there are some players that still need to complete the ‘Kill 76 Wanted Players’ challenge.
---
Yes, this photo is old. Get rid of it. No one wants to see you crying over false information. Beat it kid.
---
You don't have to mislead people to make your point. That's why everyone thinks you're a fucking moron. This game has so many problems that going out of your way to criticize something from over a year ago by implying it's the problem currently, you lose your credibility. And your attitude towards everyone calling you out for this is expected. I hope this thread is not a true representation of who you are, because it is a fucking shitty representation.
---
Idk. After about a year, they finally fixed the ultracite combat rifle receivers to use .45 instead of .44 ammo. Maybe one day they will fix real issues without creating two equally troubling ones

This is not false info. It's old but it's still the same. Why's everyone pretending like they put in a revolutionary new cheat engine to replace this shit?
---
And you you purchased it at almost a 40% discount of that.  Again, warning bells should have been going off bud.
---
Bethesda as a therapist. Betherapist.
---
I'm ashamed of this now.
---
And yet, you can’t actually gain any ‘loot’ other than crops, water or basic junk out of resource collectors. 
---
You can’t get anything out of their stash. You can’t take anything out of their vendors without paying for it. You can’t take items out of their Fermenting Station, etc. 
---
This isn’t like Rust where you can loot a bunch of stuff out of someone’s base. 
---
But again, go for it. I’ll take an easy kill to advance my ‘Kill Wanted Players’ progress.
---
Well, it fooled me. I considered it was photoshopped but honestly 100% expected that this was a thing people could do in this game with the piss poor anticheat. Completely forgot about legendary attach points
---
I'm lost-is this to reinstate it after rolling it back because of the glitch and is DRWR now working properly please?
---
Haven’t got a single holiday gift from it, it’s cool but I’d take some wallpapers over having it listed for a month for sure lol
---
Dun dun du du du du dun
---
Yeah it is one of the acceptable sets
---
Could this post increase the amount of hacking going on? Are you exposing the obvious or did you just hive a "gem" to a bunch if shitheads? I barely understand python, so thats where im at.
---
Wouldn’t it effect all of my games when they update then?
---
Nah, why? Most of my purchases had no issues before this one.
---
Your right first player I met was 2 levels higher than me and just stabbed me for no reason his little knife insta killed me. Honestly level shouldn’t dictate if I can loot others
---
the mechanic for snow already exists in the game too.
---
just make the toxic valley ash/snow fluff go all over the map.
---
Nope unfortunately
---
Beth is hoping to fix 250dr with Wastelanders
---
Patch 16 broke armour legendary effects, so they rolled that fix back
---
Today was the minor rollback patch
---
it's not october year round in the game.  time moves.
---
when it went from summer to fall, we got fall leaves on the trees.  they were green in the summer.
---
I’ve been getting some good junk from it. This is only the second week of December maybe they’ll have another good freebie next week for Christmas?
---
Except I’ve met a few people who have placed their survival tents at Whitesprings for the sole intention of preventing people from loading in their shops
---
This method is obsolete now.
---
I'm on ps4 as well and I have all of the fasnacht plans unlocked on my main, be glad to help you decorate later. I'm usually on late evenings after work til whenever I get tired, west coast time. Psn is MyLittleShadow, send a small message with the request so I know who you are.
---
Add the sound effects of snow crunching, some blizzard mechanics and environmental effects on the player and boom.!
---
Oh so much variety...!
---
Except, you know, literally not that.
---
I use a junk extractor so that might be why I’m less enamored with it as it’s junk isn’t better than that for me personally.
---
Straight out of the forest.
---
Lmao you are getting roasted nerd
---
A 512 mo fix? 🤔
---
Right, so what you’ve posted is outdated and inaccurate, thereby invalidating whatever shitsmearing campaign you have going on. No one gives a fuck. BF5 subreddit is still pretty salty go hang out there you whinny ass.
---
I have the regular collectron and the junk from it is better. I think the santatron just brings toys, coal, fertilizer, and a very small chance of one of the gifts.
---
I dunno man, 600+ updoots and two silvers, doesn't look bad to me. The real clowns are people like you who think Bethesda is doing something amazing for Wastelanders.
---
fuck bethesda
---
Sometimes I hate being right...
---
So you dont waste more time:
---
There is nothing you are going to say here that will change the fact that ruining someone else's play time so you can have fun is a dick move.  Sorry, not sorry.
---
Pc - 10 star hacks
---
What it has ALWAYS been from BETA on...Bloodied Stealth Sniper.
---
Should’ve been set to at least give one small gift. I wonder how many people are going to keep it up past the holidays lol
---
This reminds me of when somebody posted to this sub (or was it the main fallout one?) saying there was no encryption. They posted pictures of network traffic and said they could kill you across the map, make you drop all your items and hack your PC because it was all right there. Post had thousands of karma and a few awards.
---
Was all bullshit of course. They posted it after a server stress test (the sessions before release) so that nobody could verify or disprove it for a few days. It spread across the internet though. Surprised but glad to see scepticism about this post before too many jumped on the bandwagon.
---
It's not back, this has been a problem for 100% of the game's life span. From the beta up to today. It was "fixed" during the january 2019 patch, which made it far less likely to happen. Then the vault raid update broke it even further again. Tesla rifles can still 100% consistently cause it within a few minutes of play time. Other weapons like plasma flamers, regular flamers, and some combinations of bloodied/fire rate/explosive/etc weapons like .50 cals, gatling guns, gauss rifles, etc can still cause it too
---
I read somewhere it’s like a 1% chance at a gift. I will be switching back to the regular collectron.
---
It's not inaccurate. This is still true. Old doesn't mean outdated and inaccurate. Just because I took a photo of the Eiffel Tower in 2007 and posted it today doesn't mean the Eiffel Tower is hot pink how.
---
Are you General of enclave? You have to do the quest to access a silo. If so, I'm down later after work, 9pm pacific... Heavy gunner PA support. Psn is MyLittleShadow
---
That is slightly better but still shit. Is actually same shit but with a cherry on top.
---
It’s coding not a building. A lot has changed since launch, nimrod.
---
Ya I just need help getting through the silo I have everything we need to complete it
---
It has not. This code is still in the game, that's what I'm saying.
---
I think 'very interesting' is a stretch. This games writer basically just ate up everything admitted dupers told her, nor is it new information to say that some people make a lot of money selling items from online games.
---
No to mention you can heal with it using friendly fire perk.
---
posting a question that someone answered 10 min before
---
the laziness of some people
---
Hmm sounds right. My question is if both have it on a team do both get  -33% +8% damage   so you should have a net of -25%   have tried to test it its just what i thought anyone confirm?
---
Turns out you somehow know less than I do about lockpicking you love this piece of unfinished shit so much you probably have fallout 1st meaning you have never reached max junk stash. In short you have to store some items in lootable chests and containers at higher levels as in the stuff someone would want cus you can’t get anything else in your stash
---
To the Corporate White Knights in the comments: please keep defending Bethesda for their incompetence despite them not paying you so that they have ever more reason to release shitty products
---
Then why use this instead of the present code. You're just trying to stir shit for attention and karma, oh that's why.
---
Bethesda has clearly crossed the line of cosmetics only, but this sink performing like a basic water pump only indoors is useful to virtually nobody but hardcore roleplayers. I'm not sure describing that as 'utility' is completely accurate, especially considering how many people will take your comment about it being non-cosmetic.
---
let him do his thing
---
Because this one is way easier to read for the average "gamer", that's why, since it's not unreasonable to assume that the averahe Fallout 76 player does not have a degree in comp sci?
---
can anyone tell me how many of the Aluminum Christmas trees you're allowed to place in your camp?
---
I'm incredibly miffed you can only place 2 large trees and don't want to bother with the aluminum trees unless i can place 25+ in my camp.
---
Yes, there are some jerks. But the existence of some jerks doesn’t justify creating a ‘forced move’ for those that aren’t being trolls, in my opinion.
---
English common law is persuasive in an Australian court of law. If Zenimax are found against at VCAT (which uses different rules of evidence) and decide to take it to court all of these cases become relevant to the decision.
---
But you already know that I'm sure. I'm just a vexatious idiot
---
Not lazy, didn't see that someone asked it
---
10 star doesnt actually exist it was photoshop by sage but yea 5 star new meta
---
Because BGS refused refunds, legal precedings are the only way to get them. Given Australians got theirs due to a legal judgement against them
---
Yeah... that Santa sack is gonna be mine.
---
Yeah, I actually asked him some questions and he shrugged them off with "beta is offline currently, see for yourself once it returns". 
---
Obviously the question was also controversial.
---
The rewards are the taxidermy plans and other rare plans like robot armor and plasma grenades which can be used year round
---
If he was able to damage you, then it wasn’t for ‘no reason’. If you’re Wanted, you’re fair game. And anyone that kills you gets a bounty of caps (taken from **your** caps) equal to your level (max of 50 caps). 
---
And there’s an Atom Challenge of ‘kill 76 Wanted players’. Plus you drop your junk upon death, which he probably looted. 
---
And if you weren’t Wanted, then you got flagged for PvP some other way, such as attacking him or his teammate (without Pacifist enabled) or you were trying to contest a workshop. 
---
Outside of a very specific method, if you’re not Wanted, don’t attack someone while you have Pacifist disabled, or try to claim/contest a Workshop, no other players can damage you in Adventure Mode. 
---
I strongly recommend you learn the mechanics of the game first before going the ‘Raider Route’.
---
Yeah, I don't know.  I'm on PS4 and can't get into an actual world.  Been tryinh for 30 minutes.
---
spider scorched, spider scorched, does whatever a spiderscorched does
---
I can, but I'm on PC
---
That would be awesome! When would you be available again?
---
Wow! Some strong words, from people that might want to find the definition before expression! Lmao! 
---
I get it, this information may be unrelevant, and it may be true!  
---
But to start a verbal war of words towards someone,  is at the least, just as poor, as the post your criticizing! 
---
I am not defending this post, because I don't know too shits about coddling, and algorithms. 
---
Mind  you, I do find it interesting at the least.  
---
But I  will definitely defend someone when they are being attacked by people that use words like Cunt to make a point, just to reference one comment that stands out! 
---
I thought this community was better than this!
---
 Instead of everyone attacking him for this post! 
---
Why not prove him wrong at the least, by bringing facts to the table. All that I keep hearing is alot of hot air being blown around, with no disrespect to anyone. 
---
I get it in the heat of the moment, things are said, but come on now. 
---
Okay, so out of curiosity, what are Bethesdas prevention against hacking, on all platforms? 
---
Because to be honest, 2000+ hours in,  on the Xbox  box Platform.  I have seen, duping, I have seen people do shit that honestly should not be happening in the game. And yet I am told that it is absolutely impossible for someone to hack into this game, or use cheats well playing on my platform. Yet it happens. And my source is from a complaint I made a few months ago to Bethesda. So is it a bug that hasn't been resolved, and someone is exploiting it? 
---
Nonetheless I wish you, and everyone the best! 
---
Let's be kind to our neighbors! No one is perfect!
---
Posted something similar and devs took it down for clickbait lol... i guess they're off to lunch.
---
no free item except the Santa-Tron :(
---
Is this a reply or a poem?
---
There's a ton of rare plans that you can get that have zero to do with the holidays.  Mostly taxidermy plans but also power armor plans (for the pa it'self not mods), plasma grenade plans, etc.  
---
Most of the legendary items you will find will be scrip trash as always but it's amazingly easy to hit the 150 scrip cap and if you have multiple characters you can easily max them all out every day with minimal effort.  
---
So it's up to you if any of that sounds appealing.
---
I mean they were up for a while... ya cheap bastad! LOL.
---
Finally got in.  Incapable of joining a friend from main game menu or PS4 menu.
---
It's a poem! Got a  problem with that!
---
That’s not what people do. Any items in a public container will be gone after a server reset. 
---
And players cannot ‘lock’ public containers that happen to be in their Camp radius. Any of those that are locked don’t belong to them, and those are instances for each player. 
---
Meaning, if you and I both access a safe in the world, then you have your own item list and so do I. Anything I pull out doesn’t even exist for you, and vice versa. 
---
No one stores their extra junk that they want to actually keep in a public world container. And Fallout First is only about two months old. 
---
Many of us have played in the ‘400 lbs stash’ days. And we learned inventory management. 
---
Once again; you need to learn how the game works before either going the ‘Raider Route’ or even worse, trying to talk like an expert in here.
---
It sucks at this rate I'm just going to get sick of it and leave again
---
If it has to basically redownload the whole game for every tiny patch I'm hardly going to get to play the event even.
---
Nothing like running whitesprings, flicking vats and double tapping level 62 ghouls without skipping a beat. I'm damn near useless on the queen, so I have my bss meat hook to sort the bitch out!
---
That alone no, but the fact that even when the tent isn’t physically within your buildzone you can’t because you’re within its is broken as fuck
---
I really hope you have your Santa power armor on when you do this.
---
Translation: He slapped his camp down by a cabin that already exists in game.
---
Three words.
---
Enforcer explosive shotgun
---
In Australia there's no snow lol maybe West Virginia is secretly Western Australia...
---
I keep seeing people with these enormous camps with turrets and decorations, and wonder what I'm doing wrong with a two story 3x3, a deck, no turrets, and full budget.
---
That’s definitely peculiar. I would expect the game treats them the same, occupancy-wise.
---
He repeatedly hit me, he was already wanted. I assumed Todd put a little bit of truth when he said fighting was balanced but it’s back to my unfinished piece of shit argument
---
+1 for screwing up the title oops.
---
I gave up on this game back when wastelanders was supposed to drop. Everyone move along, nothing to see here except a mess.
---
So this shotgun will collect cards for me?
---
As I say this 7 days ago they came out with a candy cane weapon 😂😂😂
---
Right now. Also, my routine this week will be online at the morning for a couple of hours, and in the afternoon (5pm-8pm). I'm in the CST time zone.
---
I personally believe they did what they normally do, copy pasted the code from camps, which is why it has a unique buildzone. However certain parts of its personal buildzone ignores others. For example, I can place my tent at the edge of your camp. Just outside your buildzone. If you leave and load back in you can’t place your camp anymore because it’s now within my tent buildzone
---
No just making sure how I should read it. Poetry needs a different mindset.
---
You wrote paragraphs about the wrong thing I don’t mean random containers that are part of the world
---
Yeah it's mostly on fire ( really hope that those get put out soon invade you're from there) which would be appropriate for the Battle Royal mode as long as they change the name.
---
Another tip for wiring, you can wire through mesh floors then switch them to a solid floor after your wiring is set up. This makes it so you can wire up a whole second story (or first if you're creative with how you place foundations) with your wiring completely hidden.
---
what platform?
---
How much EXP is needed to reach this level?
---
Then that means you retaliated. Being Wanted flags *you* for PvP; that doesn’t mean you can damage other people that aren’t flagged for PvP. 
---
And if he ‘repeatedly hit you’, he didn’t ‘insta-kill’ you. 
---
And for someone that doesn’t even know the basics of the game yet, you certainly have a biased opinion on the game. 
---
Bias and ignorance are a dangerous combination.
---
Thank you, none of the pictures showed it, might have to grab it now!
---
Chasing down the rare plans by mowing through Santa Scorched is the most fun the game has been in months IMO.
---
You are doing it correct!
---
same thing isen't it
---
Not Us. - They've been trying to tell us they aren't the enemy. These are the people from the first vault. Hope we get a Scorched faction with the option to fuck up our bodies to be like theirs.
---
I was honestly try to defend you, because I personally now how this community can be.
---
 Mind you, I am not the smartest cookie in the bunch! 
---
Nonetheless I wish you the best!
---
Not really considering Reddit wasn't loading properly, so I could only see posts from 3 hours ago
---
uh oh, what are they gonna "fix" now
---
Oh I'm on xbox probably should've specified that
---
Ps4
---
Just do an experiment for me....Look at your SPECIAL numbers on your current build....Go pop in max class freak and compare...I think you will be surprised at what you are losing in shear numbers....  Also, do you just run around in PA and shoot a big ole gun all the time?  I run 12 in Strength unarmed Unstoppable Monster and a Boxing glove, BE Lever as backup..... SBQ switch out unarmed cards for Heavy Gunner cards, remove Nerd Rage and put in stabilized and run my AA FFR Primed gatling laser...Easy switch out....You could also do this with a rifle/commando switch too.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/376722/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-december-18-2019
---
Santatron, apparently
---
Then what are you talking about?  Any ‘containers’ within a players Camp are either Stash boxes (which are instanced uniquely to each player), water collectors or resource collectors. Or, they are pre-placed containers that exist whether the Camp is there or not. 
---
What do you *think* you’re ‘looting’?  If it’s anything other than water, crops, junk or ore... you’re not looting another player.  You’re looting the ‘world’.
---
ah well, I'm on pc.  Happy hunting and maybe someday we will have cross play :)
---
looks like santatron not dropping gifts has gotten the elves' attention.
---
Santa has been hoarding them all to himself and the elves are pissed that all their hard work is going undelivered.
---
PC here! Been farming and have extras. We need an auction discord/giveaway discord group, dang it.
---
This is often how scorched spawned from a travel encounter walk.
---
Which head plan was the last one you got?
---
Is that you, Ron?
---
oh he can keep them for all I care, all my chars are overweight with the insane amount of legendaries from this event
---
yes?
---
&gt;  Try harder.
---
Tell that to Bethesda
---
It's been a problem for me since day one. At least my melee seems to be working fine tho. Couple patches ago it took a couple hits to register.
---
I wish the damage bug would get fixed.. I'll hit an enemy health goes down then back up it seems. Not sure the issue. Not every enemy but some.
---
No elf suit dissapointing
---
shills be shilling, man.
---
None of this would be an issue if Beth didn't use an engine that's been picked apart 10 times over for the past decade.
---
And how exactly does this change the fact that you’re having a mental breakdown because people are calling you out on spreading false information? People upvote and gild stupid shit all the time lmao
---
Oh yeah its my fault but still a week.
---
Instead of going around looking at Christmas lights in real life I'll just walk to people's camp in my get a way game.
---
It was Mounted Mirelurk Claw.
---
They should up his percentage rate because he missed a week, from 10% to 20%
---
&gt; paying for convienence isn't pay to win
---
Sorry.. he should've said pay to not play the game. That's better.
---
Oh sweet, any chance you guys know the location? Really want to check it out, always loved cozy cabins made of wood, but the one we can build is not that great ahah
---
No, I try to do the same then forget &amp; drink them. I'll be glad when I have the last three recipes
---
idk about OP, but I hate on FO76 b/c it's a sloppy mess thrown together by a money grubbing company using an engine that's wholly outdated while asset flipping the previous game. 
---
But that would be a reasonable thought.
---
Robot vendors. Under misc tab
---
Don't know how on earth they thought it was worth being the final rewards. I grinded like crazy for the skeleton outfit, but I won't care if I don't get that outfit. They've shot themselves in the foot by being greedy
---
Underrated
---
I don't use tesla weapons and have this issue. I have no idea a fix. I'm hoping all these updates they are pumping it actually fixes something. Not a revert of a revert.
---
Its always been this bad.   It's just that hackers have made easy to use tools for cheaters so everyone is using them now there are 5 or 6 "one click" tools that work on current version.
---
There are exploits (that have been shared with bethesda and on cheater forums) from *beta* that are still in current build and exploitable.
---
duping is still do-able btw, even after they did a big PR claiming it was fixed.  Cheaters are just keeping it very low key so they don't raise too much attention.
---
this game is trash.
---
Throw them in a vendor for 100 caps. Thats what i do and sell out
---
Whoa calm down there buddy, he said the meta not the chuck Norris
---
I know what I'm losing, but I don't feel the need to have more carry weight, ap, or exp. I'll throw on class freak when crafting. But other than that the int isnt that important to me
---
And yeah I live in my strangler armor and shoot giant guns all the time. I've done the unarmed thing with full Unyielding n it was great. But I went back to my gunner. I just love it
---
Mid-range price for an RNG item, or a stupid high price for those low chance drops. I'd go with getting as many plans now as possible.
---

Blue pyjarma'd bastards

It happens to any Tesla, not just explosive. I have a run of the mill Instigating Tesla and it happens at least once a session.
---
Wait?!   Where is the Xmas Tent in our FO-First sub?  Did it appear in the Atom Store today?
---
In comp 17?
---
Has it started yet I mean can we get the xmas rewards?
---
Nope.
---
I jump vats stuff all the time (Jump to see in a window or over a hill, enter vats, hit shoot and wallah, dead enemy).
---
I rarely have it miss at 95%, but when I do, it’s when a charred diseased level 50 ghoul is in the animation of attacking me and I have rad worms.
---
Not in this sub they won't. As it is the excuse for every item that gets added to the atom shop when they are called pay 2 win. That it can't be pay 2 win as there is no competition you can "win".
---
I'm sitting at 85 free gigs and something tells me the update is less then 7 gigs I'll bet.
---
got any furious combat shotguns? lol
---
cool story.. good on you
---
Cant wait to receive my presents from ZAX for being a great overseer ;)
---
Doesn’t have access to a good quality of life job. It’s not that hard to read basic english
---
Also, a little known budget-bloat culprit is the wiring that you run between conduits and generators.  If you don't take the trouble to scrap the wiring when you store or move objects, that wiring stays as 'phantom' budget occupancy until you move your camp or rebuild it.  Always take the time to remove wiring before doing any changes!
---
Looking at the datamine the aluminium trees do have a decorated variant with balls on them. There is no Christmas tree in the datamine with lights on it so I don’t think we will get that unless it’s patched in for next week
---
Right thank you, i had to guess it, looks amazing, you know the place by chance?
---
Freaked out about the items? I played PvP d2 which was full of hacked items back in .09 it was some of the most fun the game was. I hope they keep these items around honestly, I find bugged and hacked items are fun to screw around with and fun to duel with as long as everyone has access to the same items.
---
Literally the same still. Nice try tho.
---
I'm on PC, I ended up giving it to a newbie
---
What was today’s patch for?
---
If I could PAY someone to play this mode for me so I could win these, I fucking would. I WANT those.
---
This is an essay written by a law student lol who doesn’t know why he is talking about.
---
Sorry, I should clarify. The "you" was more generally referring the community. Not you specifically, I apologize for that.
---
I agree, some of the stuff will be interesting. Like that bat we saw earlier. It also may lead to legendary versions of weapons like alien blasters in the mix, since Bethesda keeps neglecting them.
---
And who knows, maybe Bethesda will "fix" this by making the 5 stars available legitimately.
---
I got downvoted to hell a few days ago for pointing out of wasn't possible. 
---
Without some serious work the game can only store 5 legendary effects and the gui cannot display more than 5 stars.
---
No... it really doesn’t. Look at your pip boy. 
---
And no, the trees have always been that color since launch.
---
I was talking about closed b.net back in patch 1.09 USwest had wrings and hex charms on closed b.net USeast had occy rings, ith weapoms, 6 socket windforces, 4 socket stormshields, and east had tons of "hacked" jewels as well, like 900%+ magic find zephyr bows.
---
I think this one is near seneca rocks visitor center.
---
Check to make sure the auto-renewal didn’t get turned off somehow. I wasn’t getting charged when I expected and checked. It was off for me so I just manually re-subscribed.
---
No idea, didn’t notice we had one (PC)
---
Because Preston Garvey is running around White Springs station in his underwear hollering about some settlement, he’s not supposed to be in WV.
---
Craft mando armor.
---
Yea sorry ps 4 had a patch (at least I did)
---
No need to be rude. You start off saying quality of life matters. Now you are saying he doesn’t have quality of life. When you use sentence fragments it is easy to be misunderstood.
---
That’s a ‘Festive Winter Suit’, my friend!
---
PS4 had a patch today
---
I haven’t said anything. I just read the thread
---
Last week sure. This week, no, because we got nothing.
---
At this point I don't care, got my Plasma Grenade Plans, finally.
---
It's mostly a visual problem
---
I don't think you understand what he is saying
---
At this point and 1 star weapons and most armor I don't bother looting or drop for others.
---
Wait?  Is that verifiable?  I researched this some time ago, and everything posted in forums and Reddit said the Plasma Flamer Mod does *NOT* work with Friendly Fire perk...?
---
Are you trying to teach me what pseudo code is?
---
The santatron is easily worth twice what a wallpaper or icon is. They might make up for it next week, everyone is so quick to complain about everything Bethesda does on this sub.
---
PS4 copies the entire game, then deletes the old version.
---
The only time I needed a 70+ gig update for FO76 was when I installed it, the update today was like half a gig for me and I have shoddy internet and it was downloaded in 20 minutes
---
I'm by no means an expert but this seems like the exact same thing, just with more writing...
---
He said got the code from the hackers “research” not a screenshot off the blog post
---
I had this happen with one of my camps earlier today, I think it's just one of those odd glitches that happens when spawned in.  I just quickly store the odd turret and then place it out again, and it's fine.
---
He makes reference to case law, which is common law, meaning it's acceptable Australian jurisprudence
---
I know literally nothing about programming, but from some of the comments it look like you don't either
---
O:
---
It happened to me also. I’ve seen it happening at camps at WS station. I fixed mine by going into the build menu, storing the turret, then replacing it.
---
Bwahaha.  Whiners owned.
---
Nigga wants people to go to super max prison for hacking in a few sheckles
---
Yea, last week it was. This week it's worthless because it's already been claimed, is my point.
---
And yea, maybe they'll make up for it next week. But it's Bethesda so I'm.not gonna hold my breath.
---
You think that because you don't understand coding, like the average Fallout 76 player. They just act like "Someone says Bethesda bad? Downvote."
---
**Preston is doing WHAT?!**

They aren't going to do anything for at least a month. Just like last December when the dupes were released over the holiday, they didn't do anything until late January last time. Not even mentioning they probably can't do anything as they are dealing with 2 completely different versions of the game, the one currently released and the one they are building wastelanders on.
---
With their handling of the 250dr bug fix breaking half the legendary effects it is pretty obvious they pulled that fix from the wastelanders version without checking if it would work properly.
---
Honestly I just hope this game gets true private servers we can run ourselves with whatever mods we want. Because the way it has been going since launch I think others could run the game much better than Bethesda.
---
You can but it's difficult. They're a little clipped into the wall. I have some over my front door. Move em out too far and you get the floating error.
---
I think it’s a glitch or bug (imagine my “shocked” face here). The store and replace fix worked for me, too!
---
Big fucking deal.  Play to whine.
---
Got all armour plans, don't care about plasma grenade plan that's newly common
---
There's a new free F1st item in the store. 
---
A holiday survival tent
---
I got mine above a few of my doors and on the walls and on my fusion generator and vending machines. It takes some fidoodling but you can get it on a wall. Maybe try the conduit trick and hang them from that? I havent tried that yet.
---
Oh I definitely agree! Point still stands in regards to op though
---
Yes still available, got it in my vendor for 16k
---
3 must haves:
---
Adrenal Reaction
---
Speed Demon
---
Marsupial
---
Where would I check if it’s off? Through bethesda? I’ll definitely have to check that.
---
Already planning on going for speed demon and marsupial 🥴
---
I downvoted cuz you gave expired information.
---
Nice, can’t wait to see it
---
Unfortunately doesn't sound that appealing. I can see how bringing that previously rare stuff in is cool for other players and all that, but it doesn't mean much at all to me. If anything I have too many legendary weapons, all heavy weapons I can't put multiple of in my vendor
---
Awesome giveaway. Hope that lucky fellow realizes just how lucky they are.
---
The reason I love Fallout 76 is because of stories like your giveaway. 
---
The helpful players make it a lot easier to stick with this game long term. I started during a free trial over the summer and was most excited to try out the mutations. Well I lucked into marsupial at a super low level and didn't want to give it up, so I made the trip to whitesprings resort to collect nuka grape to remove rads and keep the mutations. Wandered through some camps near there at level 10 and a level 120 ish gifted me a level appropriate legendary hunting rifle and a melee weapon. 
---
I continued my journey and as I was passing by the golf club to hit the resort I was mobbed by dozens of ghouls, so I marsupial jump on top of a bus and try to plan my escape. Then another high level came by to save me. He emoted when a legendary arrived and let me tag them all while he kited them and then finished them off.
---
Needless to say I went out and bought the game immediately after that. I have since regifted those low level legendary items, but I did keep my very first 3* I got from those ghouls a furious walking cane with 90% reduced weight as a souvenir to remember those helpful strangers at the very beginning.
---
Build a platform and build walls around it
---
They’ll only start caring once it affects their profits. 
---
Downvote me, it won’t change the fact that they view us as cows to milk and 76 as a project only to fund their other projects.
---
I think it depends on your platform. I’m on XBox so I just went in through the Fallout First link in the bottom right and then to my payment/subscriptions in Microsoft. Don’t remember the exact path though. 
---
Hope you get it sorted out.
---
You.  They're coming to fix you.  Get some tylenol.
---
That's ok, shill
---
I think I have a similar link I can check out. Thanks for the suggestion!
---
Just cut out the middleman and pay Bethesda the bitcoin
---
You have to do the quests to get the Standard back Pack, the Mod plans for it cna be sold.  You can also get a small backpack in the Morgantown airport terminal in the overseer's chest.
---
&gt; Total cost....4800 Atoms....
---
Wow, that's going to make a significant dent in the 12,000 atom I have.
---
if (strstr(runningProcesses, cheat) =NULL

---
I wish I could live life as ignorantly as you
---
To unlock the backpack that you can skin you need to complete 3 tadpole badges (thus completing the tadpole portion of the questline) and get the plan from the vendor at the scout camp near grafton dam.
---
The only tradeable backpack plan is the small backpack plan from Morgantown airport.   You cannot apply skins to these, only the standard backpack from the tadpole quest.
---
Yeah, it's Nuclear Winter irl minus loot boxes
---
What do you want to know about d2? And are you talking pre or post rust storm and warden?
---
Slacker.
---
Find player vendors selling them from 200-500 caps each and buy them.
---
Really. 
---
I thought it was only attainable though pinoner scouts.
---
Might have to check. This grind is a pain 
---
Which is absolutely bullshit. Tent zones should be exactly the size of the tent's footprint. It should also be allowed to cut into existing CAMP buildzones or into loading ones so long as the space is empty. If they can check for item coordinates for the bulldozer function as a CAMP loads they can do the same for CAMP item Tent conflicts.
---
Not sure honestly
---
Easy farming method for mutations...go to top of Pylon 9, I think it is, in Cranberry Bog....Go to the top and their is a monorail car there....turn right and go to the end.....Press the button and some electrical arc comes on...Jump through it (you are going to die) but you will pick up a mutation every time...Good Luck
---
THANKS!
---
Visit JUG on Youtube. he has some great building tips! including some of the tips mentioned below. he is very good at explaining exactly how things work. As other people mentioned i often travel to peoples camps to get some inspiration and then incorporate bits from everyone into my camps. I re build once or twice a week. its my favourite part of the game. I have started trying to keep the physical build at half budget and save the rest for decoration. All depends on what I'm going for. Location is also key. you have to be happy in your surroundings. i like the lush greens of the golf course, but also like some cliff spots for the view.   
---
honestly just play around and just experiment with building. its so much fun! if your stupid like me an spend a lot of cash on atoms.. atom shop camp purchases really really help make a place look good and full
---
I’d rather get them the hard way lol, I have other things like plans I’m trying to save caps for
---
Did you not read the second top reply with the current anticheat code? It is just whitelisting now instead lf blacklisting like his screenshot shows.
---
Both end up doing the exact same thing, scanning for .exe names on a list.
---
sounds like you should skip it, then.
---
They added a small pack for low-level players sometime this summer, it only holds half the standard.
---
to clear things up,,, its still the same anti cheat
---
I would guess it comes down to the engine being used and multiplayer more or less being frankensteined together in the first place. Pretty wild stuff for sure though.
---
Honestly I don't think I've caught a disease from either method. Now if I get within 10 feet of a higher level ghoul, I seem to contract bone worms or flap limb. It's always one of the two.
---
Ok, shill
---
&gt;I found a spot I really like &amp; haven't moved from it in many many months.
---
Me too. I've relocated half a dozen times, but always end up moving back within a couple days.
---
Hopefully to patch the chest engines that players have been using to add crap to the game
---
Speaking of vendors anyone got any good .44 for sale?
---
Anyback pack would be useful right now.
---
These tadpole badges are a grind only managed to do one.
---
Just need the smores plan to do the cook one but only plan ive seen was in a players vendor for 5k caps 😂
---
Any link to the 2nd rewards (pictures)
---
So what?
---
If I’m not at/or around 150 cores, I start feeling uncomfortable lol.
---
A visual problem? It tells me not enough free space
---
Medic build is almost useless now because it is best used for PvP in survival servers but now we no longer have survival servers.
---
Tank is kinda unnecessary but being tanky is kinda fun.
---
You cannot really even start to specialise at such a level because of legendaries needed and perk choices are few, but you can lean your character towards a direction through allocating your specials. 
---
You want to be tanky and are using melee, then Strength is your thing, maxing your Strength should be one of your goals. You would want it maxed at 15 so you can put Blocker, Barbarian (for non PA), and your melee damage perks.
---
You might want to avoid Endurance because it only gives 5 health for each point, and there aren't a lot of good perks, but if you want to do an extreme tank build without PA then you can consider upping it to 5 or more for Ironclad and other perks. 
---
You would want at least 4 Charisma for the Lone Wanderer perk which reduces damage taken when not in a team. 
---
You would also want at least 5/6 Intelligence for crafting perks and stuff. The rest is up to you.
---
There is this thing called a bloodied build where you can be sorta tanky and do insane damage but you have to keep your health low, your DR/ER would not be so high either. I don't know if you would do that as keeping high DR/ER and staying full health seems more like a tank build.
---
The game that got cancelled and never finished?
---
Did you even read what he wrote? You always use a lot of big words that I don’t think you understand. Are you also a law student? Haha
---
Got two from small gifts so far
---
Hmm which platform are you on
---
Fair enough!
---
Woodchucker is really op, hope they nerf it soon
---
Lol. Me too. What the hell’s wrong with us?
---
Aww theres my problem, tried to tame one but it just pacified and thats it, thanks
---
Another random tip: You can embed pretty much anything in a wall if you build a doorway, place the item on the floor where the door would go, and then change the wall into a solid one. You can make display cases look like they were built in, you can build a stack of lightboxes, wire them up, and then encase them in the wall so they look flush mounted, etc.
---
Yeah, the have market cornered in the wood scrap game.
---
you are about 6 months late on learning about the awful anticheat this game has. but it does have 3 different scans, you are only listing off the first one.
---

---
Using /iprelease then /iprenew in cmd prompt is enough to change your IP. Closest way they could ban a person would be through a hardware ban, as ips can be changed and MAC addresses can be spoofed.
---
Thank you
---
Amazon sells pc copies for $10 so that’s good
---
It wouldn't be so bad if you earned these rewards concurrently, instead of having the counter reset every single time.
---
Soooooo, is this actual source code, or something you found, somewhere?
---
 I think I would have to buy it, if it was anywhere near reasonable. ;)
---
Yes there are only 3!
---
Ah so you just jumped in to be rude.
---
Or those of us waiting for the game to \*\*\*\*ing update.
---
So the info is outdated. And because it’s outdated,It’s false
---
Thanks for the advice. I have kinda dug through these Reddit to see what is good right now. I am not too interested the the bloodied builds. I did draft this up on the builder website. I made this build more towards how i always played the fallout series. [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwQLBgMNBAgBAQEAKugBA8EBArIBAfABA3sDfAOHAQPQAQJrA4MBA6UBA7ABA4kBA3QDcQOsAQEXA7sBA9UBA9cBAdsBAwA=](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwQLBgMNBAgBAQEAKugBA8EBArIBAfABA3sDfAOHAQPQAQJrA4MBA6UBA7ABA4kBA3QDcQOsAQEXA7sBA9UBA9cBAdsBAwA=)
---
Actual code.
---
Not everyone who gilded the post is just here to trash 76. I play every single day, even after all of my friends left to play other games like Borderlands or Outer-wolds. I’m still here supporting the game and trying to influence where the games future is headed.
---
I’m not very vocal in posts or comments, but I’m here casting my vote on posts to show that people still care.
---
bro, you admitted you didnt know about the hacker forum until you read a kotaku article that linked to it. lmao sit down
---
At least u can get the santa suit separate this year i paid 2k for it last year
---
Laaaame-o.
---
 Go into Game Options in the launcher. Make sure Auto Update is on. ;)
---
Christmas rewards starting in a bit. Wait till later on and kill two birds with one mini nuke.
---
(PS4) ;)
---
From... the source of the game?
---
&gt;What do you do when you hit max caps from selling items?
---
My vending machines are in a 1x3 area that has a garage door and a regular door with a level 3 lock. The garage door and vendors are wired to a switch located in my locked bedroom. When I get too close to max I simply flip the switch, which closes the garage door and turns off the machines. This means that even if people stumble across my camp they can't access the machines. 
---
The small locked door allows me to access the area to add or remove stuff from the machines without having them powered on and worrying about people buying crap while I'm trying to adjust my inventory or prices.
---
A link to the Twitch rewards?

Says the man acting like a prick because someone else doesn’t have the same options you have. I spent 3 years in a hell hole of a job because it was the only thing available. I didn’t make nearly enough to even get a car. I walked a mile in the heat, the rain, the snow, when it was 5:30 am and 14 below. It’s the only job within walking distance of my apartment. So my QoL was shit. Being able to make money off of playing game sure as hell beats any job if you ask me. And whether you like it or not, anything can be a job, yes including games. It’s called grind. And 76 has it.
---
Nope the top comment in that thread from the dataminers that shows they still are doing the "look at exe names" but now they are going with a whitening instead of blacklist. Still same thing.
---
Try glass caverns. Go through it once then go back to beginning and this time pick a piece of ultracite. Scorch will spawn. Kill them then pick another. This also works around fissures but I find going through here twice then hopping servers is the best.
---
See!!! That’s a holotape I would follow!!
---
How is that relevant?
---
I had to drop the link to twich and reenable it, that worked
---
Console players didn't get a complete patch when they rolled back that armor/reload problem.  Today's update on console only was apparently to finish that.
---
We have settlements already, they are called C.A.M.P.s
---
its relevant because you are a noob that doesnt know anything about the anticheat, you only just learned about this stuff and you havent learned it all yet. watch this video for starters https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cD9RMEb5Urw
---
The anti-cheat code is in the first 30 lines of the program?
---
would you be willing to sell one to me I'm on ps4 too
---
The gift boxes are distinct from Legendaries... I don't think they ever said the Santatron would deposit actual Legendaries.
---
I think you can only get 1 per server. So if you get something you don't want purge it and log to main and jump back in.
---
Removing them is random so get at least one set. Speed demon and marsupial seem to come often enough it's not too hard to lock them in the "natural" way.
---
This is going to be a repeat of last December when they went radio silent for a month and a half right when the dupes went public in middle of December but didn't put out a patch or say anything until last January.
---
So don't expect this to change. Also almost all of the hackers were using free smurf accounts because they expect them to be banned. But they won't ban those with just the items as they've been giving them away in the gift boxes to innocent players. So basically they have no way to track these items and ban the hackers.
---
&gt;Visit JUG on Youtube.
---
Good call. Watching one of his videos is what helped me figure out the trick to building curves and creating enclosed spaces without foundation support.
---
They should give us free shit for Christmas. Am I broke? Yes. Do I want shit but have no money? Also yes😔
---
Hey man. If you can get more recent info id totally back you up.
---
But you didnt. And your info is bad. Your username fits you btw. Only a person like you can get mad over the internet
---
I'll give that a try thanks
---
Thanks was wanting to see the 2nd drop any link for that?
---
I know. Literally if I had a choice between a holiday scorched dropping 10x large presents OR taking his blue-snowflake suit I’d take the suit so hard I’m sure I would rip one of his limbs off lol.
---
So, current anticheat blocks cheat engine, you're saying?
---
They are just using basic cheat engine. This is nothing but script kiddies. Literally anyone could do it with the program.
---
Then I guess it doesn't work. 😐
---
No i dont think so either, but still cant carry anymore
---
I appreciate the advice greatly as I had no idea it was only one per server, but I tend to server hop to switch up the player vendors to get a wide option for plans so that’s not too inconvenient.
---
