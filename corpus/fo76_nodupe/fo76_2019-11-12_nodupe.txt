You guys really have that good of luck with farming these?

Blow out your ass pedant.

They probably didnt have any tech they wanted.
---
I'm level 235. I don't run any dr or health perks and win almost every game. I'd rather use perks that make my offense stronger.
---
That sucks. Title made chuckle a bit though, first thought was "neo, is back in the matrix."
---
Camden Park, on the floor next to some wooden blocks in the shed with 'The Boss' robot.
---
Haha it is definitely worth the trip back down there!
---
That made me snort my drink.
---
I’m on console, no hackers here.
---
What a joke of a game
---
A long time ago, when pvp servers were just coming out, I did a video on this though twitch (it's gone now because of how keeping videos there works, anyways)

Stealth has all kinds of issues with one of them being distanced rendered. Basically if someone is running around in your area and you just happen to be outside their depth of field or render distance, the moment they get in close, even if you are in stealth for you and maybe 1 person next to you, that person sees you perfectly fine. They can even vats you 50/50. Your team members can run to far away, turn to look at you, and suddenly you are no longer in stealth. This bug works with the Chameleon mutation in the worst way as the mutation will make you blink and cannot be fixed unless you pop a stealth boy, take off or put on weightless chameleon or normal Chameleon armor (then take it off) to reset the effect. It isn't even a garrote that this will work. 
---
Stealth also has a duration issue when it comes to stealth boys but, by now we all know that these are features, not bugs, and surprise manics designed to keep us on our toes/ point of rage quitting. Working as intended.
---
With the terrain of 76, and general gameplay of the fallout series, I find the most effective approach is to "always make sure you ARE the closest to the outside of the ring OR have the impassible obstacle between you and the centre of the ring." Basically always seeking the flank.
---
I've accidentally outflanked a team of three that was downing my own team by just bumbling around moving clockwise or counter clockwise around obstacles and whatnot. 
---
When I have gotten my multi-kills, my team and the enemy team intercept each other as two lines, with combatants storming to the right or left of these lines. I happen to be on a ridge or otherwise have elevation, and I can see the entire enemy team and they don't notice me.

Yes, tried to fast travel to the Whitespring and ended up in cranberry bog, can't remember the place but needless to say, it was definitely not the Whitespring.

Doesn't matter. I'm also on console but they don't make platform specific changes. You can't have pc hackers gaining tons of atoms.

Blocked people can show up on your NW team so wouldn't be hopeful.

Yes, I've just published a new guide. You can have an idea of how "lucky" it can get: [https://youtu.be/S34j7Xq9fbg](https://youtu.be/S34j7Xq9fbg)

Id like to see more of america added to 76 in the future. Is it too out of the realm of possiblity to imagine someone spending a full day walking from one state to another
---
rofl
---
I guess it is all rng, my luck is garbage though.
---
People can’t do that stuff on console “pc master race” my ass
---
Fuck yeah. That was my jam as well, RTS everything. But due to friends being obsessed with Halo and stuff, I found myself playing that often too
---
This should be very easy to implement. This game already gets a good portion of its data from the servers on client request in JSON format and not as a stream. While I'm not sure how Beth has implemented their net stack, in almost any case all they would have to do is have the client query the world before joining with the player CAMP coordinates and get a quick JSON response that either tells the client whether the space is free or not. This isn't taxing or resource intensive for the server at all.
---
A request could be as simple as this:
---
{"request":"join","playerCAMP":"250,420,50"}
---
And the server response as simple as this:
---
{"response":"ok","canPlaceCAMP":"true"}
---
Is that last sentence a joke? You can fast travel to camps, brother. And if that’s a functionality that’s blocked when blocking and I’m unaware, they can just physically walk there
---
They should add perk cards that buff a specific group of weapons(hopefully the underperforming ones), like Grunt and Cowboy from New Vegas.
---
For example a perk that increases the damage of all Pipe weapons, another one for the Civil War weapons, another for the Cultist/Bone weapons, another for the Firefighter weapons,etc. Something that allows them to be on par with the top tier weapons from their respective categories.
---
Never had a server crash on my private server.  Neither has my wife.
---
Sorry you're not having any luck!
---
do you have their PSNs? I want in :o
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one that immediately thought of riding a battle chicken into a nuke zone.
---
And poop is tasty?
---
Much appreciated
---
We have all 3 playstations and it happens most on the Pro. Not gunna lie 9/10 it loads a lot faster but that 10th time is always when ur doing something important
---
For what it's worth, 'server not responding' is not necessarily the result of a 'server crash'.  In fact, network errors are a lot more likely to cause this sort of issue than an actual server crash.
---
There should be a super crazy wasteland scientist who invents a time machine, one that can only take people to the future (to the times of other fallout games) the machine cannot go back in time because the past is the past, but they can steal the ideas of the future to improve the wasteland today. 
---

as for rewards for doing so, some themed items/skins from those games in question.

If you chose to stay on that world and dont build anything else will your camp be ok for next time you login, or would you need to place it again with your blueprints

Congratulations

oh sorry bro. patch 15! lol

"How is asking a question that can easily be answered, "entitled"?"
---
Because you went on to complain that others were stopping you from getting the answer you seem to feel you deserve. Therefore you seem to think you're entitled to an answer, which you aren't, it's purely at the discretion of others to provide one if they so desire, which few did. I was merely pointing that out. 
---
"My assertion that I have a right to be given a chance to be answered is completely justified"
---
No it isn't and no you aren't. I can demand that I'm entitled to a response from you for this message, but I'm not, I'm entitled to jack shit from you or anyone else, you're completely free to ignore me. In fact it's probably best you do
---
"There's absolutely no reason to have downvoted me except for that first reason you gave"
---
Except you can't know that, yet you're insisting that you do
---
Over analysing? Dude you're the one confused by the initial down votes, perhaps a little more self reflection is exactly what's needed?
---
Why would anyone assume the worst? This is Reddit.
---
Anyway you got an answer and a bunch of up votes , so it's all good now. Yeah?
---
im not okay with this
---
yup all the stuff is gone
---
Not one server crash and usually when I run a private server I have two game clients running at the same time on my rig swapping gear between the various alts or using one to instant respawn areas without having to log in and out.
---
This wasn't historically a multiplayer franchise and you're bothered by people not being openly friendly and communicative over the mic? Let alone the mixed language issues in regions with vastly different national languages.
---
To add to this,. . .This game is online only and you are at the mercy of the game severs.  Remember: your internet speed is only as fast as your slowest connection.  Meaning, that even though I have a 300Mb connection on my end, it drops to 120 as soon as I hit M$'s live service.  And that further drops when playing on the FO76 servers.
---
And as previously stated above (slightly), if no one on your server is in a particular region, then there is no need to have it loaded.  So, when you get there, the game has to render everything, on top of every other region that has people in or near them.  
---
Add both of these things with the poorly optimized game, and it starts to make sense.  Bad excuse.  But, it's what we have.
---
Ok ty

I was gonna say this. In xbox at least thers 5 or 6 regulars and a few other less social folks like myself that tag along from time to time.
---
Reason why I don’t play on PC
---
I was at 13,952/14,000 XP. One more game and I would’ve been good, but nope. Even worse, I’m on the East Coast, not too far from where their HQ is, so clearly they meant East Coast right?
---
&gt; And no, moving just one skill point per level doesn't count.
---
Yes it does.
---
Its only 7pm on the east coast. 🙈
---
I got them by now.
---
I just launched my first nuke ever, I feel proud. But that's not the point here.
---
It's not about feeling weak or something, it's just that i'm bored of playing heavy and i'm looking for new builds ! Eventhough I found cool heavy guns, I'm just gonna store them in case my heavy gf need them or if I feel like making a new heavy character one day ! \^\^
---
You should not be at the SBQ fight at all at Level 7...end of story...you are doing no damage to the Queen and probably not enough to the ADS to gain experience...SBQ fight, IMHO, should be at least level 50 or above...
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Thank god I play on console, couldn’t imagine getting 1 shotted.
---
Commenting here so it hopefully rises, I had tonight off and was planning to grind the last couple k away and yup, gone. Not exactly fair as I choose to hang with my family this weekend and was working the rest of the week. I tend to win or place high so I was maybe a few hours out too. It says 12th which in mind would mean the 13th it would end or at least in the AM on the 12th but definitely not 7pm EST? What? Not too upset just disappointed.
---
About the one in the tracks on Charleston, there's [lots of other places to get the vendor bot to spawn](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/File:Mappalachia_random_encounters.jpg) - my favorite is in Janet's Soft Serve, where the turkey is. It's much faster since all you have to do is go down the road and server jump.
---
If it's above level 5 then it's the wrong level for you.
---
It might have been level 62.   Can't imagine why I might know that.
---
The moral of the story is never ever buy a bgs game again and only then will they understand that they work for us we don't work for them.
---
What platform are you on? I have a spot near Morgantown that a lot of people take. It takes me 1-3 servers till it drops my camp. I am on psn servers.
---
Cancer?
---
The plan was to leech off of the the other players but it didnt work so ur absolutely right. Got some lvl 20 legendaries tho lol
---
&gt; This game needs some **helaing**, big time.
---
Wha?
---
I'd be happy to get any new info, though to be honest I'm less interested in hearing about Wastelanders. I'd like to see that they have some focus on the interim, and would rather have info about things coming in the next month rather than things that may come in 3-4 months.
---
Yes, they ended it for all of us. :(

I didn't say there was a problem.  I'm just pointing out that Wastelanders is unlikely to change the nature of the game sufficiently that those not interested in playing it now will stick around once it drops.
---
I do believe that there will be problems though.  I believe that the NPC's will be basically holotapes with slightly more interactivity.  People who stand in one space to ensure they're there to spew out the next quest text.  But that's just me.  I'm a cynical asshole.  I certainly don't think its going to make the game like FO4, let alone FO3 (and certainly not FNV).
---
It is depressingly empty. And no, that isn’t “epic” or “cool” because it sets the tone. I just hopped on then for an hour and 80% of people just stand in their camps the whole time, not even joining public events, and the other ones just completely ignore you, even reject team invites.
---
If they took TSE out maybe, but they didnt. 
---
They took it off of energy weapons which include the following:
---
Ultracite Laser Pistol/Rifle/Gatling 
---
Laser Pistol/Rifle/Gatling
---
Plasma Pistol/Rifle?Gatling
---
Flamer.
---
All of these weapons with any prefix and explosive as a secondary are legacy weapons. 
---
The only weapons that are not energy weapons in the legacy category are the Survival mode weapons like Unstoppable Monster, Action Hero, Sole Survivor, The Guarantee, ect.
---
Those are specific weapons from a defunct game mode, and no longer drop.
---
When people discuss legacy weapons however, they are usually speaking about explosive energy weapons that no longer drop due to explosive being removed from energy weapon drop tables
---
You always serve up great videos! Thanks! Yes, I've had good luck getting scrip fodder hunting SB too.
---
nope I'm casual at reddit as well I'm told. r/fallout76filthycasuals
---
12:00 PM reset on most updates like that.
---
I'm thinking of using this to mainly farm scrip.
---
Server crash or disconnect?
---
Leave some memorable junk item in a world container so you can tell when you are getting back on the same server after a disconnect.
---
I haven't had a server crash on a private one yet. Disconnects are pretty rare too, maybe once a week. Still get maybe one client crash every two days though, but I'm running my graphics all the way up.
---
So did I miss out on the event or do I need to just wait for reset?
---
just watched a video on YouTube about this. she had this map
---
Maybe I am being too careful, but I never accept random team invites, as I was jumped a few times by people who just wanted to PVP kill and grief people early in when the game came out.   I just play solo
---
I see the watermark now
---
Bethesda didnt replace TSE With Two Shot, Explosive
---
TSE Litteraly means Two Shot Explosive
---
How do you like the build? Does it feel balanced?
---
[removed]
---
Not happy either. Grinding last night and the servers kept crashing. Also only needed one or two matches.

Definitely agree, this guide is very nice. I've just had no luck with getting the sb to be 3*

This post is about camp placement, not acid farming.  I had the same issue with my camp and I don't place it on resource nodes.

No hate from me, I know I'll die. I don't even try to mount a defense unless the ring drives me onto dry land.
---
I'm est and it just disappeared for me.  I'm probably a game or 2 away.  I'll update if I get the reward.  BS if we don't get it since it said until the 12th...
---
Indeed.
---
They just ended it about an hour ago, almost a full day early... I thought I had enough and then say it was gone.

This has been happening to me but instead of a different location it spawns me further away than usual, like a good 50-100 meters away and it’s slightly annoying but not a huge issue
---
Holy shit man Im not trying to rag on you at all but seriously fuck yourself. I presented a solid argument expecting something at least slightly intelligent. Yes it would be better to have a larger stash and access to private servers for trades and such as well as stability since you would think private servers would be more stable (apparently not) if you want to do something specific with friends. Yes fallout first makes the game worse but if they added that for free it would be worse? You asked for proof of a slippery slope you got one.
---
That's what I'm saying I was at like 11k so I think I'm just going to keep playing and hope it comes up.
---
Oh cool. I didn't even notice him there before the event launched, perhaps his assets was added a week or so before the event was due to start. I honestly don't know.
---
Any exploits found, any crippling data protection bugs I vote you publish them online wide open for maximum exposure since clearly reporting them in confidence has people just following procedure like a cold soulless robot.
---
Yeah, I agree. I've been playing since beta. But, I never noticed him there. To be honest, I wasn't exactly looking for a new npc around there to begin with, Aha. Either way, I'm glad he has a permanent home now.
---
Yes. Indeed it is nice.
---
This is so unfortunate because NW is such a fun game mode.
---
Love it. If I had a better explosive weapon I would be better off but for me I sneak 2 shot most things.
---
I'm having major crashes and instability as well.
---
It seems the longer the server instance goes, the less stable it becomes. Eventually it'll crash out and I'll lose my workshops.
---
Well CRAP. I was not expecting it to end until the 12th.
---
just passing by to say that pretty cool
---
On PC a lot of mods work, its basically a modders royal instead of a  battle royal.
---
Thank you. I will remove this post shortly, so the other may shine.
---
Same here. We had to stop last night because we kept getting stream sniped by hackers and now I get on and it's gone. The only thing I wanted was the skeleton outfit.
---
Where at Tyler county fairgrounds would I find it
---
I feel for you. I am totally in the same boat.
---
I do not play on PC but can you not just hover over their name on the map and click "send message"?  Is that really that difficult?  I do it all the time on Xbox, I would imagine the same option is there for you on PC.
---
I was going to finish it today, I was so close =(
---
No, something is wrong it’s definitely not the 12th. Every other time there is a reward or an seasonal event week it ends at noon on the day listed.
---
Well that is what the login new screen has been telling us all week. 😭
---
Fun fact: level 3 locked toolboxes and treasure mounds have roughly the same chance to contain power armor plans (~0.5% or 1:200)
---
My main character is a bloodied lever action....Let me know if you want any pointers
---
Yeah, total fucking bullshit. All of the other shit that Bethesda gets all the grief over I just ignore, keep playing, keep spending atoms, stay loyal 
---
I swear to god
---
Yeah I noticed that too.
---
The faster reloading legendary doesn't stack with speed demon, so both of my combat rifles reload at the same speed, but lately the one with faster reload is reloading notably faster than the other. So it seems speed demon is probably not working for me on reloads.
---
Running seems fine.
---
Straight up fucking lies from Bethesda, again.
---
That feature is part of the Fallout First Subscriber Package.
---
I propose a solution: when you block a player, the prices in your vending machine are tripled for that player only.
---
Same here. On my last match and poof. So disappointed.
---
'We appreciate your report and will pass this information on to the dev team'.
---
NW winter bug. Shows larger than it should.
---
Ah thank you :), I wasn't playing on NW though
---
Just reading the name of that song makes my eye twitch.
---
Can I give you an example of why this needs to be this way?  Well, I will....I just saw a post and want to go buy a weapon or trade for something...If my CAMP spot is taken and the system auto directs me to another world then I can never get to the world where I NEED to go....  Some people need to go to worlds to do stuff and interact with other players and sometimes my site is not available on that world but I still need to get there....Make sense?
---
Ill give ya a melon for it
---
I misunderstood how to do it. However the original way worked
---
Did you go from NW to adventure mode?
---
I didn’t say autodirect though now did I? I said when you select the find another server option
---
Bethesda flails around with a ban-shotgun and a blindfold.  They don't know who they're banning.  They don't care.  You must have done something even if it wasn't this thing.
---
Yeah. That'll be it! Thank you :)
---
1. No. If PvE - anything can be made viable, as the game is too easy at this point.
---
2. It was happening a lot about 3 months ago. Barely played since then, so can't give you a definitive answer.
---
3. TSE shotguns were never good, per se. TS is a bad prefix for a shotgun. On point - TS is ok-ish, not meta though.
---
4. Yes. 
---
5. It did improve, but still shoddy.
---
You . . . you do know that anyone can make a Reddit sub, right?
---
So, if you want to name and shame cheaters . . . then make a sub for that.  And you deal with the fallout (heh).  No need to pollute this one.
---
Just take it to the Purveyor
---
It's not free. It's 12.99 a month or 60.00 a year
---
I am the exact same way. I am not even a big fan of NW but I wanted my costume so I put on my big boots to give it a go.
---
Only for this to happen. My heart hurts.
---
This guy codes. Bethesda wants your address!
---
Me too :( I’m still gonna just play and see if I get it.
---
Been playing this game daily for a year. When they say something ends on a certain day, it is ALWAYS at noon eastern time on that day. Idk how the fuck they fix this mess
---
scrip
---
I literally have one friend because I only added my gf so that we could play on a team together, and kept it that way because I don't want the huge friends list issue.
---
So true!!!
---
sssssssssss - then people might have to stop running around gathering loot because its too dark to see.  They might need to start using those camps.  Bethesda has a firm policy in place that forbids darkness in their games lest a player have to stop killing for more than 30 seconds.  This goes all the way back to Oblivion.
---
I was litterally in the middle of making a post about this when yours popped up. I stayed up till 4 am just to get close enough to finish it tonight, and i work from 6 am to 7 pm...
---
Not sure what that means or how to do that honestly. I'm not really big into many games
---
..just have enjoyed every Fallout I've played, and this is the only one I have issues with.
---
Looks like an overseer room. Maybe vtu itself was a vault experiment. Like get a bunch of well educated aspiring students together, challenge their morals with a great postition that requires them to do horrible things, and see who breaks and who conforms.
---
Yeah it doesn't make sense. They usually follow Eastern time which means it was supposed to end in 4 hours and 40 minutes from this comment.
---
I was so close. Submitted a ticket &amp; united for visibility. I could cry.
---
It's not my connection. I have been through that, and have the largest ban width I can get.
---
When you launch the launcher, click game options on the top right and select, “scan and repair”.
---
&gt;doesn't mean people can't use mics
---
Can mean they don't want to.
---
Sorry man, you missed it. It's gone until maybe next Halloween
---
It would put this up for 1400 in my vendor
---
Seems to have reset at 4 pm PST, that's when i noticed it was gone from the top of the Character tab of the challenges menu. Very disappointing. Did they 'accidentally' set the reset time to UTC?
---
My guess is that modding will be restricted to private servers, so F1st will gain in popularity (and revenue) when modding comes out. Depending on their approach, they might have another store to purchase mods, and for mod creators to make money (with BGS getting a cut). That is why private servers are online, so they can control what mods are applied to private servers in the future.
---
https://discord.gg/s2tGt2H
---
No, but a lot of people are saying check before loading or similar...  I want to have the option to stay in that world
---
I wouldn't even mind forking over a sub fee, if they gave us an option to host locally. But that'll never happen, so i'll be keeping my 14 dollars.
---
I feel like I wasted hours for nothing now
---
I don't think that's the idea. I imagine the process should be that if you choose to JOIN a world, you should join it and gain a message. But if you choose to FIND a world, then the game should designate a world that has your space free so that you don't need sit through multiple loading screens for no reason.
---
Does anyone know what timezone they go off for their dates? Because my Nuclear Winter challenges are gone and I thought I had until the update for November 12. I wanted to try and finish off the xp to skeleton suit tonight but cant now. I would at least like that clarified for next time because being on the East coast I would not think it would end at 8pm.
---
I get that but I also get the complaints about it because it's super annoying. There's many times I don't care, I'm only logging in to trade in scrip and I don't care if my campus can be placed. But other times I want it.
---
There's no reason it can't find a world, check the spot, and then prompt you if you want to switch to another world. I think the argument is it takes a minute or two to load just to find out you can't place it, why can't it take 10 seconds to check and then prompt you before even loading in.
---
Everyone on this thread has. 😖
---
Mods are a private server only thing so I'm not sure how that would devalue fallout 1st instead of increase sales
---
Why do you want Ultracite Armor?  X01 is king
---
Then they don't have to. But it's weird that literally no one uses it. I know they don't want to. I know they don't have mics. Whatever whatever. I'm complaining about the fact that people don't WANT to use mics.
---
They were all over the place public and private a few weeks ago, now I can't find them on either instance.  I think its just luck of the draw.
---
I was going to grid the rest out tonight, guess I’ll head to bed early
---
I see them almost everytime I scroll through notes at watoga. I hear a lot of people say they have trouble finding them.
---
I believe, and someone can tell me if I'm wrong, that the vendors have a list of things that spawn and once one of those more specialized things is purchased it doesn't respawn for 20 hours or whatever the timer is. So your private world, since nobody else is in it, just happens to have those items.
---
So if you buy the signs and letters plan and then join your private server with a different character I bet that it's not available from that vendor anymore.
---
Also as a side note with hard bargain 3, some grape mentats, and whatever else you need to increase your charisma you should be able to get that plan for like 9k.
---
Splash screen shows down for maintenance Nov 12 10am EST...
---
They did it for a reason. It's called a CAMP, construction and assembly MOBILE PLATFORM, it's not a settlement, you're supposed to move your camp as needed.

whatever helps you sleep at night

Is there any other way to check how much XP we have? For some reason I still feel compelled to keep playing until I hit 14k. I was only around 1k away when I last noticed the challenge being tracked. :(
---
Are you on ps4?
---
The exploding part is decent, the other two perks aren't very good.
---
Personally I would do a price check on that subreddit which is not allowed to be named for some stupid reason.
---
oh okay, I was just surprised when I been on private server that I found them so easy. By the way they are not worth 10,000 caps. I mean I want them but dam you can not even use more than 50 letters so your even limited to its use. I put up the name of my shop and put Guns, ammo and lots of other great crap for sale...lol
---
I was saving the 4k xp I had till today so I could grind it out with my brother &amp; get the costume together. Now I’m done, I’m actually done. Fallout 76 is done for me. I defend BGS, I defended F1st but they can’t even uphold I simple word (UNTIL THE 12th) well that’s odd today’s the 11th. I’m just done, gonna go to other games maybe I’ll swindle my way back to Destiny 2 this games dead to me man. Seriously disappointing.
---
Thanks for the report, we've got ban incoming to your account ASAP.
---
I had the same thing happen. It’s definitely a bug or something wrong on Bethesda’s end. I was so close to getting it as well. I submitted a support ticket, but I don’t expect them to care enough to bring the challenges back or extend them...it’s really disappointing.
---
BGS is silent on the subject as always so I’m done. Not gonna play anymore they can’t keep their word on a simple date, they only care about the money. Just done now, gonna switch to something else now. Sucks I really enjoyed this game but this is my last straw I’m out. Not gonna be lied to day in &amp; day out by these idiots. Sell the company to someone who cares about the fans &amp; fans only I’m tired of BGS.
---
So grateful
---
Get the text chat mod: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151
---
It's really surprising how so many PC players do not know there are mods for F76.
---
xbox :)
---
FYI: Explosive bait does ***not*** work on scorchbeasts.  If you aggro one and there's an open area nearby, it will land every time. 
---
Only creatures on [this list](https://imgur.com/a/DMc6AkY) are attracted to explosive bait.
---
Awesome find
---
I submitted a ticket as well, maybe if enough of us submit it they'll extend
---
It's a myth. See my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dv0rjp/roadmap_to_farm_fissure_sites_for_legendary/f7a7pwr)
---
Farm legendarys for scrip and sell junk to robot vendor for 1400 caps. Maybe join a few events.
---
Whener i had tried to join groups in xb1 they seemed cool at first but then turned to murder, exploiting invites, tricking people for their junk and caps. EVERY group.
---
Now i feel relief that does not happen anymore. And it is lonely
---
Same problem here. Yeah it makes no sense why they would not disappear until after the update. Probably going to put them in the Atomic store tomorrow and say if you missed out here you go.
---
I know this isn't proof at all but here's why I thought it did- https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d8xjfe/psa_imo_the_explosive_bait_100_works_on_queen/
---
Im with you on this one bud
---
Man, I feel for you, but this is hilarious. Can they even do one thing right?
---
Same here I have like 9 hours of grinding in and poof the challenge disappeared
---
Maybe they ended it at European timezone. Here in France it's 2:37am, don't know when it disappeared for you. To me grinding so much point was a no-no anyway. Because I was doing the challenge each day it showed up, I add to redo every single points. To me the combat rifle paint wasn't 7500 but something like 21k from start because my points were going back to 0 after each reward.
---
I'm familiar with Mappalachia, but there are some patterns I've observed: not everything happens at every spot (unless RNGesus is just fucking with me?). There are three "object" spots that I've reliably gotten civil war reenactors, but I don't ever see them at others. (The dam that everyone farms for the Halloween costumes, for instance--never seen the CW corpses there.)
---
I just assumed--maybe wrongly?--that this behavior was the same for all random encounters.
---
But mined data is hard to argue with, and you're not the only one to tell me about Janet's.
---
Ok guys, big brain time.
---
Bethesda Austin... Austin... A-U-S-tin... AUS... Australia... It's Nov 12th now in Australia.
---
Case closed.
---
That was lame too, I waited till all the challenges popped up and then only needed 14k total but I got close. I thought it would've ended with the maintance tomorrow.
---
Oh wow.  So that means they set it for 12 GMT like the Nuke Codes.  Not 10am est tomorrow like literally everything else?!  lol.  That really sucks :(
---
We're already "tomorrow" in Europe. Maybe that's the explanation.
---
Ok, I know that this is distasteful, but the real truth is to get the  Yao gaui and chicken mounts you have to complete the hidden quests *mount a Yao gaui and chicken*.
---
Don't  forget to bring a lot of antiseptic, Abraxo and disease cures.
---
Mutation, either get it randomly or buy it from the Enclave/Players
---
I don’t mean to get so upset about it but missing out on a unique outfit like that because BGS can’t keep track of their own calendar is ridiculous. Yeah maybe I should’ve done it yesterday instead of waiting until the last moment but I didn’t think BGS would lie about it. Maybe it’s a mistake &amp; they’ll bring it back? But who knows cause they haven’t said a word about it.
---
They said it would end on the 12th of Nov.. which even in all American time zones isn't even here yet.. so they screwed it up or something
---
Ok so after another 1000xp (should be around 15k)  still no reward, rubbing it in that the Halloween event info page is still up and says until November 12th...
---
Sad I'll not be able to show you a little trick for people like you two D:
---
Visibilty. I seriously hope its a bug.
---
name calling and profanities are really not needed
---
I'm glad I grinded mine out a few days ago.  Commenting/upvoting for visibility.  Hope you guys get it fixed!
---
Preaching to the choir. 
---
How does a AAA studio keep getting away withbarefaced lies every other week
---
That’s usually when dailies/weeklies reset, so everyone assumed that would be when the rewards would end. :(
---
The problem is the time zone they are talking about would be middle of the ocean because even england is 5 hours ahead of Eastern time zone so it should have went down at 7 then
---
Just another BGS lie. Can’t be surprised anymore. Unless they bring it back for a day I’m done I’m not gonna be lied to anymore by them.
---
I really really hope so. They should extend the deadline at least.
---
Thank you.
---
Retract what I just said bc I'm stupid. So they set it to European time? I thought I at least had till ~8am CST guess not
---
When did everyone notice it gone?  If it was about an hour,45 ago, then it reset at 12:00 GMT like Nuke Codes do :(
---
This is the final straw /s
---
There's so much hidden stuff in this game it's insane. I'm at 800 something hours and just found a marked location I had never been to before (despite grid-walking the entire map) and another unmarked location that had some pretty cool lore in it, and I also JUST found the responder colonel holotape (who the hell builds a front porch with no steps anyway).
---
Just keep looking around places, and walk paths you normally wouldn't.
---
Legacies are usually traded for other legacies in trading subreddits. Caps and outfits arent going to cut it most of the time (unless ur tqlking about q red assylum uniform, or an item/plam of similar rarity). My advice to you is quite frankly, look fot an easier alternative, or grind your heart out, with multiple characters.
---
Neither of which were directed towards yourself
---
The first case I saw said they noticed at the end of a match ~ 8pm est
---
It should've imo. I think they messed the timezone. Idk how they'll fix that. Best thing would be adding a few more days as an excuse.
---
I defended 1st &amp; even bought it for a month but this was enough. It said all over the main menu (ending ON THE 12TH) just distraught man. All I wanted was that outfit, screw the red asylum, screw the pirate outfit I wanted THAT one. Maybe I’ll come back for Wastelanders but likely not.
---
Better let: allow players to submit their own insults that are turned into text-to-speech for the robots, like Mad Verse City from Jackbox.
---
I actually went down at 8pm EST for me(in EST) because I also thought maybe UTC but idk really
---
I usually defend the developers as much as possible and put the onus for the bad shit on the greedy corporate people but wow, that is total incompetence.. 
---
same with that Fallout 1st error that had PC members losing their access one week in. This is real simple stuff, these kids of mistakes shouldn’t be slipping thru with this kind of frequency at a major company like this.. 
---
Really really makes them look like a joke
---
At the very least they should give a reward extension.
---
Exactly!! Like all other events.
---
The following day's rewards were unlocking early all throughout the event around that time so that makes sense.
---
100%!!!
---
I've played the game for almost a year and never knew that.  No wonder my weapons are breaking down constantly.
---
I haven't played this game in a year, but I have no idea how to refund it so here I am, subscribed to this subreddit, on the off chance that I'll have a feverish dream prompting me to play 76.
---
Point is, I'm just commenting so this will rise and HOPEFULLY the Bethesda team will see it and fix this. Because I may not play this game, but I *always* play the game of correcting injustice (yeah, I was reaching there, but whatever).
---
It just works
---
Actually this could be an interesting tidbit..  
---
There are "far away" models assigned, and they are ghoul, but why it would happen to one player and not the other in the same location is odd....   
---
I've seen it happen on multiple accounts, some with render down to zero and others maxed, so not sure it's the render range, but still interesting.
---
Haha yeah, the myth goes back like 6-8 months. If you have comments in that thread sorted by "best", there's another datamininer (friend of mine, actually) who also says is doesn't work, but didn't show the evidence.
---
They have lied every step of the way. Cant really be a surprise
---
Yup. &amp; they’re silent as always. Sucks man I was 4k away but I was gonna stay up all night to do it (I suck at NW so 4k is a grind for me without double XP). Just went to the store to get some snacks, come back &amp; see they’re all gone. Nice lol
---
I noticed the challenge info was gone once my game crashed and I logged back in to that splash screen :/
---
Is this going to turn into another one of things Bethesda has done wrong?
---
Man wait until you get to a busy Scorchbeast Queen if you think the nuke bluescreen is a problem
---
There's also another thread of this going around and they said 7pm est as well
---
True. I was stupid enough to defend them. Well, now I’ve realized &amp; I’m done. Cancelled my 1st &amp; gonna put the game at the back of the shelf for a while. Maybe I’ll show up for Wastelanders, maybe not. Just ridiculous. I’m so upset the Fallout franchise was ever sold to them man. It could’ve gone to someone who actually gave a shit😪
---
Making a comment on a barely known Reddit post is one of the worst ways to get Bethesda's attention
---
I have been grinding all day, took a break with roughly 1300 to go. Came back and it's gone 🙃 I wasted 6 hrs of grinding today
---
One would think that start/end of the event would be announced with **time+timezone**.
---
How hard can it be?
---
They reset the nuke codes at midnight GMT ... so it would seem they did it based on that or something close to that rather than the normal 10am or 12 noon Est\\EDT
---
The bots with watoga in their name still won't be. You have to kill a dozen or two of those kind or nuke the place and then the bots start spawning as  level 52 gutsies and usually one or two are legendary. It's fun to do once or twice but not practical to farm.
---
Your camp comes back if you hop to a server where the coast is clear.
---
Its an industry wide problem, companies churn out garbage half made games with the title "early access" and sell them full price but never finsh it. I defended them and now i just want my money back
---
It does affect the ghouls inside.
---
I'm just about positive that it does not.
---
All they had to do was add a slider...
---
Doesn't it feel great getting fucked over and over by Bethesda? Fun times, great company.
---
r/ChoosingBeggars is that-a-way.
---
Scraping the weapons or some station vendors have a few
---
They plan on removing this try again feature and insisting you just have to pay for private server via F1.
---
Yeh, I don't want to sellout the video in here, just sharing the roadmap for anyone who might now watch me :P
---
Bethesda messing up and fucking over their last few fans? Noooooo
---
It's not common, I only saw it a few times so far.
---
I've also submitted a ticket in hopes they can extend it because we're all upset. But I doubt they'll do anything.
---
Post more of your fidns
---
I was so close to getting it too, fucking pissed now
---
As someone whos played since beta, i thought the servers rolled over at 7pm est, which would explain at least some things
---
Bethesda Australia... :O Okay, but where's my job? :P  
---
I'm not entirely sure, but I thought the servers were running off of EDT \[Eastern Daylight time\] which it is currently 8:58PM Monday, 11th of November. Meaning we'd have about 3 hours left to grind before the event challenges disappeared.
---
Yeah I completely understand that that’s why I just now made a mule I’ve been grinding all week now. I just thought I could give it a shot on reddit to see if anything else is possible to get that weapon ya know ?
---
lol, of course.
---
Same. I run a lead deposit. Yesterday, i had to try 5 times to get on because it kept saying my CAMP could not be placed. No, i don't want to remain in a world where my CAMP can't be placed. Of course i want to try another world. Why not just take me to one in the first place.
---
Laser gat is heavy AF - so bear arms
---
Fusion cores are heavy AF so batteries included AND power user. powr user doubles fusion core life. when I reload I have a 999 round magazine. 
---
currently I am running without bear arms and have all heavy guns perks plus bullet sheild plus blocker. 
---
that puts my weight at a 80 to 100 pound combat loadout.  which includes 50 fusion cores 10 super stims and a scattering of antibiotics and radaway. 
---
 I can only get away with that because I use a Vampiric Ultracite lasergat. to be honest the .50 is probably beter. no spin up time, ammo is already light and fairly cheap to build. 
---
I dont know what the dps is on both weapon types. I honestly think the positives and negatives of the 50 vs the laser gat lean to the 50 cal over all lol. if I ever find a good one I will be swapping over for a trial run for sure.
---
Not sure that’s why I came to reddit too see if I can have some luck haha
---
Or, or they could just announced start end of the event with time and timezones. Like every mmo developer does.
---
I will be crossing my fingers and hoping Bethseda listens. Thank you.
---
I feel the same as well. All the time spent grinding for that costume feels like such a waste now. I'm not into playing NW but really tried to grind it out for the Halloween stuff. So crushed that it disappeared when I was only a couple matches away from obtaining it.
---
aaah gauss, I miss it at times. my first end game build on my character was end game sniper with gauss tse. (pre nerf days)
---
They almost have the whole line painted.
---
Same. Unfortunately I doubt that’s happening in the US. We’re out as much money as we paid for atoms &amp; 1st &amp; the game itself &amp; they get to lie &amp; rob people. Truly should be illegal but the world revolves around money so sucks to be us🙄
---
It do
---
The ghouls become glowing and bloated but they do not drop glowing mass, hardness mass or irritated fluids.
---
They won’t this week. I’d love to be wrong on that but it’s going to be very quiet on anything content wise for the next few months for 76.
---
Yes, it makes glowing ghouls and bois
---
Where are these mods then? Is nexus no longer the place for them?
---
LOL yes yes indeed. equally amazing and frustrating.
---
With no radiation
---
If you do a full run it's usually over 500 ore.  Keep an eye out!
---
That.. is big brain time indeed.
---
Spend your time and money on a better product
---
When three different versions get put into one patch because nobody is sure which way they're going.
---
Doing the Battle Bot event gives 100 fuel almost every time, and an added bonus of plasma Grenade plans.
---
Wow, that’s awesome!  I had something similar happen at Big Bend Tunnel East.  There are usually like 5 or 6 scorched there, one time I rolled up on at least thirty.
---
Yeah, the person behind mappalachia said that these encounters are different depending on zones. For example the dead power armor raider encounter doesnt happen outside savage divide.
---
the dragon cracked me up. I used to joke about showing up and killing the one thing then retiring during the reload. I didnt even have a bloodied explosive. my god the numbers have to be amazing on a clean shot.
---
Some graves now have interaction options and RifleGaming has found a mission briefcase under one of these graves in photo mode too. It seems like Bethesda is adding content for Wastelanders, just like the companion interface bug that you see inside of Vault 94 (sometimes). Either that or old content that never made it "live". It feels like they develop things and then leave them in the game files. Data miners have found a lot of "content" that exists in the game files but it's not accessible to us right now.
---
Yea, I was 1 or 2k away when I noticed, it really sucks, as it was one I really wanted.
---
I love Fo76. I have met so many great people.
---
Yeah I haven't had any really game breaking bugs in 800 hours. Annoying stuff, but nothing too bad. I managed to side step a lot of it because I never used power armor much at all though. I don't blame the power armor fans for being upset with bugs since 90% of them effect them.
---
I mean, Bethesda has social media managers that check this subreddit. Commenting on this post and upvoting it will help it rise on the sub's front page, and once it's there and high up enough, Bethesda will likely see.
---
Wait, you *time* yourself doing this? W-why?
---
You can meet all the great people you want, does not change the fact that fo76 is a terrible product and managed by an incompetent company. You can't deny that
---
Vault 94 during meltdown event. Unlock only the engeneering section
---
This is Such bullshit....
---
Same happened to me. I also made a post (before Insaw this one)
---
&gt;They’re slowly improving it
---
Dude, they're getting ready to drop this game. Wastelanders will come hobbling along and fucking smash everything to bits for a while, and then that's it. They've got bigger fish to fry, and the fanbase for 76 isn't getting any bigger.
---
On PS4, can mod for free. I can also give you bullets, but only as much as I can craft. 10 caps every 100 bullets.
---
Sounds about right for NW.
---
Guess we got TRICK for Halloween
---
At least it’s getting visibility. You can tell because people who don’t play / aren’t interested are showing up to trash Bethesda/ 76
---
Yeah I'll check again tomorrow but I think we might be out of luck sadly.
---
Get to know people, then group with them. If you don’t play with friends, you are likely to get bored.
---
NINE NINE
---
This seems like the usual amount
---
That's my favorite way to kill them all. It's like shooting fish in a barrel!
---
Feel free too look me up online.  IGN LordZarak
---
I’ve made plenty of friends on the PC, and chat regularly with the little community that we have built.
---
Yup. I hate NW to begin with but pushed on to get my 14k. Sweet, not again til the next outfits. Then the wife ask me to help her get one. Happy wife happy life...she had 0/14k fml
---
Spent all day grinding in my own personal hell. Was 3k away then bippity boppity boo it disappeared
---
How is your latency, jitter and packet loss?
---
Speeds mean nothing in gaming besides time to download
---
Us too, my gf and I played from weds on and didn't even get are atom challenges this week in adventure so we could get this reward. Its seems now it was all for nothing. Another disappointment Bethesda! I should really be predicting these outcomes by now but my hopeful thinking got the best of me again.
---
I saw they did an update this morning. Maybe they took it off early
---
Same dude, same. As of an hour ago it was still there. I'm so close! I don't know how close, because the challenge disappeared. FFS.
---
yup, they ended it early 
---
BUT THE DECORATIONS ARE STILL THERE
---
At least now I now it's actually an issue and I'm not just insane. Granted I do still play this mess so that bit's up for debate.
---
Noice.
---
Yay! 😉
---
I'll remember this next time I'm on! (Hopefully. My memory isn't the best but I'll certainly try)
---
You saw what?
---
I think you are WAY beyond the soft cap on armor resists.  I’m thinking you might want to diversify into more of the awesome luck perks, but it looks like you might not ever use VATS based on your build. 
---
This is my basic Instigating Lever based Stealth/VATS build:

---
Guess that's not it then!
---
If you lived nearby I'd invite you to bring your XBox over and try it on my connection.  There's gotta be some reason that your experience is terrible and mine isn't.  We're playing the same game on the same platform.  Is it your connection?  Your local Internet infrastructure?  Has something gone awry with the data for your specific character?  I'm not trying to blame you at all; clearly the game should be able to handle whatever you're throwing at it that I'm not.  But what specifically is the kicker here?  Why is it smooth for me but not you?  I'm not doing anything special.
---
I wish we could solve this for you, because in theory you and I should be having the same experience.
---
They should have started it way sooner 😒
---
they’re such asses
---
How did you put your life on the line while playing Fallout?
---
Dang. That’s a bummer.
---
It's the one time the Ops guys took the Marketing guys seriously:
---
https://twitter.com/Fallout/status/1192139627802562561
---
&lt;Ops Dude&gt; Welp, they said "Before the 12th" so I guess we turn it off some time on the 11th since that's technically "before" the 12th
---
Imo cheat detection and modding will go hand in hand
---
1,700 xp away.. I hate this.
---
They ended it at 12 gmt, same as the nuke code reset
---
Noooo
---
That's what happens when you ass-u-me
---
oh hey it's you?! you rock. js
---
Yep, about 7pm EST I had the same issue on PC. It was there one match and gone the next! 1500 XP left.
---
So how does the cap on damage resist work?
---
Thanks.
---
And the loading screen still had it advertised until the 12th. This is some bullshit.
---
Demolition Expert isn’t worth it, do the math.  You get 4% more damage with one point, but only 2% for each additional point. So only one point is really worth taking.
---
We basically only know what they shared during the Quakecom 2019... lol That was a while ago to be honest.
---
Just give up guys. I don’t know what to say other than it’s fair to say that 76 will still be bugged regardless. Any event will be a mess and you’ll be taken advantage of. 
---
Plenty of more deserving games that could do with your time and effort.
---
I guess they meant the second it becomes the 12th somewhere one the planet.
---
So stupid question but what’s the best way to offload and share pictures?
---
You could put up a camp nearby with metal walls within metal walls. Maybe even drop an item in a paper bag inside the staircase that leads into the camp. It'll make them think you're inside. They'll investigate, which will buy you more time. If you're really lucky, it will draw another team in on top of the first team. As long as no one is looking in the water, you're gaining XP. :)
---
Take screenshots or photos through your phone, upload them to the app imgur and paste the link to them onto reddit. That's how I do my photos.
---
why don't they drop? Glitch?
---
THank you!
---
I like shotguns because they are straight up overkill with vats. I always aim at the head, and with the shotgun I have that does double damage at enemy full health, and with all the shotgun damage perks. Man, everything dies in one shot outside of scorch beast, deathclaws and other boss type creatures.
---
They really need to start being consistent with this.
---
Enemies inside load screens never have dropped flux crafting material. Idk if it’s intended or not. Same thing happens with Charleston capital building or any of the mines in the ash heap.
---
Lmao who else but fucking bethesda
---
Its unreal at this point how much they keep fucking up
---
I know it’s an American game, but wouldn’t it be a little awkward celebrating a holiday that another country also celebrates (but in a different month)?
---
hmm I have like 4 or 5 grape mentats. I rarely use the stuff. I usually save up around 10 then sell in my vendor. I have some orange as well. I use beer and other drinks a lot because I always max out my junk weight and need the extra strength to fast travel home...lol...The scrap camp we get as a Fallout 1st member comes in handy now so I don't have to fast travel but I don't plan on being a member for a year.
---
Now I’m not one who has crunched (or tested) the numbers myself.  But from what I’ve read, having armor/damage resists much over 250 have diminishing returns.  I believe at 250, you are taking 50% more damage.  So most people recommend you don’t focus on defensive perks, since you hit 250 pretty easily with gear, so you’re better off focusing on offensive perks that end the fight sooner. 
---
If you want to be more tank-y, people recommend Blocker, Serendipity and Dodgy.  Dodgy is an AP sink, so if you use VATS it isn’t optimal. Serendipity doesn’t work in PA.
---
I agree, it’ll be right when Elder Scrolls VI comes out in late 2020 or 2021. Early &amp; mid 2020 will be all about Wastelanders
---
I was right there, so damn close. Been going all day!
---
Awww Congratulations!!
---
Yeah, we saw the graves a few months ago, figured it was a cut event or something. (We didn't see the briefcase until after that video tho) We have also experienced the companion interface once right after doing free range lol :) I try to keep up on any new or newly discovered content, even little things lol
---
if you guys are on PC, i'd suggest the mod that makes the ore glow, man, you can see ore spot from across the field.
---
happy cake day though!!!
---
Have any mods installed?
---
There were rumors of exploding arrows/bolts too.
---
Hell yeah, time for some no rifle skins and clothes and hats with buckles. Fuck immersion, give us tires with buckles on em too
---
Yeah oh, save that grape mentats. I believe it's the equivalent of plus 10 Charisma for the vendors.
---
Sweet, I’m looking forward to the definitive Bloodied Paddle Ball build. 😜
---
You should just try to get your self a junkies/bloodied faster fire rate laser with whatever 3rd modifier. The fact is and no one points this out, is that once wastelanders drops, the devs are gonna re arrange all damage values anyway. This has been confirmed. We dont know the specific but if I had 2 guess, the devs are probably gonna whipe legacies of the face of the game, or re-add them with new energy visuals, making them common again, or the most likely, nerf them to oblivion, again. So, if you ask me, the grind is rlly not gonna net you a lot of value. Anyway, best of luck.
---
Nope, never have
---
Nice map, you should run a FO76 YouTube channel ;D
---
Do you know specifically which station vendors?
---
"This is the worst day of my life"
---
"No, this is the worst day so far."
---
ive crafted over 100k ammo for my minigun, in preparation for wastelanders.
---
I've farm the lucky hole for the lead ore and farm the steel ore around vault 63
---
I farm the three guaranteed spawn gnallysnatchers are toxic larrys meat and go near the legendary gear vendor. 
---
took weeks of play off and on but I got it.
---
Also I use a mod that makes the ore spots glow, makes finding the ore really, really easy.
---
Hmm okay. I’ll look into that because that would open up some perk slots for me.
---
Link isnt working for me. Can you explaing where this is, i had a camp here one i forst started and have been trying to find this location again
---
Exactly, Mandarin 🙄
---
I run shotguns and they're dogshit. Doing like 30 damage when they're in the air, and even with all limbs crippled from enforcer they don't land. (And when they regen at 50% they always go back into the air even if you re-cripple them)
---
They've said in the fallout first article that extended camp budget and workshop persistence are both coming at a later date for private servers
---
Ohhh dang yeah I never really thought bout that lol thank you for telling me! I just wanted one because I thought they were cool to use and be fun to have around haha but yeah most likely they’ll either take it away or bring them back with low damage
---
Yes! I’m terrible at NW and rarely get a game over 200XP. So many hours, so many matches..for nothing. I actually do feel a bit time-robbed. I could have spent those hours earning atoms or being real-life productive.
---
Everywhere
---
I honk scrap farming is the best way
---
I get a ton from farming west tek, and scrapping all the weapons. With scrapper on you get 20 odd steel per gub
---
Major bummer.
---
Or at least noon on the 12th. 
---
I was kinda pissed when the halloween event ended at noon and not midnight like I was expecting.
---
Even if they are, it’s still a massive joke.
---
Same. 😂😂
---
Update is tomorrow.
---
They probably meant the world standard of GMT.
---
7:00 pm Eastern is 12:00 am GMT.
---
They keep finding unexpected ways. 🙈
---
Like if you watch the last time they revealed the concept art for wastelanders, they literally said it. We are gonna re balance all of the weapons, every single one oncw wastelander drops. People are killing themselves for a legacy or plasma grenade plans, and beth is just going to make them accessible to everyone, I just know it.
---
So completely different then every other challenge they have had? Which has been based on eastern time.
---
Then don’t pay for it and quit griping.
---
Instagram says before the 12, but the patch notes say through the 12th.
---
I was 14000 away, too many fucking cheaters to enjoy it
---
Good to know it’s not a platform specific issue.
---
Dude. Not cool. I was fairly close and was planning on finishing the grind tonight. Before the 12th.
---
Grafton Steel workshop let's you farm two steel deposits and a lead.
---
Yeah WHAT THE FUCK BETHESDA?!?
---
Pretty nifty how all the Halloween decorations are still up inside Vault 51.
---
Fucking bastards
---
*"Be sure to complete all six challenges soon, because they’re only available until November 12. Oh, and don’t forget to take a look around Vault 51. ZAX took over the decorating duties this year, and the Vault is more BOO!-tiful than ever before."*
---
Camp vending was delayed and that came out really well. I hope it's the same case here.
---
You can also get quite a bit from uranium fever. Loot all the mole miners in the event and those in the other parts of the mine.
---
What?!? NOOOOOOO!!!!
---
Yeah you’re probably right. I think I might just hold back then and wait to see what happens lmao cuz I’ve been grinding the past week and I’m kinda getting tired of getting bad stuff 😂😂
---
They said that is coming in the future FYI. 1st will continue to get new features. As it stands it is pretty bare bones in terms of private server benefits.
---
This really isn’t complicated lol. I don’t know why people have such an issue. If they want those features they should just hold off on buying.  Not a big deal.
---
If its USB wifi, try another port.
---
Speaking of bush Wookiee here’s an actual selfie of me playing NE[selfie in NW](https://imgur.com/gallery/3SENpyg)
---
They sure as shit better not think that the solution here is to make it a free item in the atom shop. I was going to EARN that costume and be PROUD of it!
---
It's Ethernet, so there is only one port. And it is working fine for everything else
---
Only real solution is for then to give us an extension.
---
Oh my gawd. Of cours eyou are suppose to be alone. These wastelanders have a few rogues in them that are nasty surprisers. Before you know it, you're dead and signing off forever.
---
 Yeah, I got nothin. Its just strange that plugging it in crashes the game, and I thought it might be hardware, like a wonky USB plug. Good luck.
---
Add me to the list, I was about 500xp away so I played and added up over another 1k xp just in case. Hopefully they extend it a day...
---
I wouldn't know to be honest, I'm just aware that there's a lot of modders in NV on PC. Sorry I can't give more info
---
Plus i like the sound of Combat Shotgun 😁
---
pc player mifesto here to help!
---
Thanks anyway for your help
---
It wasn’t even a swing. Just another example of doing the bare minimum possible.
---
Hells yeah. This guy gets ir
---
no you just have really trash ass taste
---
&gt;I figured the game is great,
---
Welp, theres ur first issue there bud.
---
Any weapon. I think it might have happened after fast travelling too, or possibly only after fast travelling, hard to remember.
---
I will own that. One man’s trash is another man’s treasure. I like what I like despite whatever you want to call it. 
---
Take your little butter knife you like to use to stick and poke others with elsewhere it will do you no good here troll boy
---
farm the weapons use scrapper from wes tek, and uranium fever.
---
That's why it's weird.
---
The only two times I've ever seen places base events on for online games is Eastern or GMT.
---
No reason to switch from one to the other without explanation.
---
Mods don't work for NW
---
How close? If you leave the gate of the parking lot  of the vault and turn left straight away and cross the field where Meat week happens there’s a pond right there
---
This is seriously disappointing. I've been struggling to find time to play while also balancing work and I was only 1500 exp away from the skelaton costume.
---
You can find them at Camden Park as well, I picked one up beside the game machine earlier today and completed the challenge.
---
Platform?
---
Fair point.
---
Saying fuck it and creating a new character is, in my experience, an essential step in any new rpg. With enough complexity/eccentricities you can’t expect to do it right on your own the first time.
---
Down the hill towards the saw mill?  There’s a pond down that way
---
I thought the spot was above vault 76. But ill check this out
---
Early bird gets the worm on this one ..
---
Harvest iron ore
---
Yup, but they didn't mention what country ;)
---
Except nuke codes dont reset till tomorrow. 🤷‍♀️
---
Look up how to unlock tnt dome 3 if you have not done that quest yet, can grab cappy clothes and nuka cola paint for t51 there.
---
/u/valseek /u/LadyDevann mind following up on this?
---
Asbestos is for anti-flame mods on armor.
---
Nuke Codes don't reset at 12 GMT.
---
They've been on Tuesdays at 8 pm EST.
---
I don’t pay for it. Stop acquiescing.
---
I too feel this hurt. On a physical and metaphysical level.
---
Ha ha I am 40 years old but thanks for showing your colours.
---
anywhere that has mobs with weapons.
---
Visibility. I don't play this dog shit any more.
---
Yeah pretty sure it disappeard at around 7pm.  I was grinding some and noticed it stopped keeping track a little while ago I was pretty close to the combat armor so I was doing a few more matches to see if it popped up.  But by this point it doesn't look like it will
---
Yea you know Bethesda they think  MVP is a limbo stick
---
I can do that if you're still online.
---
People tying the knot so soon nowadays, no wonder divorce rates are up.
---
Thank u
---
Honestly watching this made me rethink allot about the builds I have for my characters, I never knew the medics legendary effect could be so powerful for tank/healer builds, great work!
---
I'll be there in 1 min
---
mentats overall moves fairly well out of my vendor. I usually charge between 5-10 caps. I try not to over charge because I want stuff to move each week. like RadX is easy to find a lot but some people just want to get it quick so as long as I don't overcharge it sells. I think the thing I sell the most is 5.56 ammo. I cant keep it in stock. That and copper bulk sells fast too. I crafter myself a rifle with a mod that changed it to pipe ammo. I use it for low level enemies and its a good way to go loot and burn up some of that ammo that nobody buys.
---
not mothmans, but scorchbeasts.. they even show up at my camp
---
LOL. They'll be for sale
---
That's half the reason I have my camp near Morgantown lol no scorch beasts here! Just the occasional super mutant attack.
---
Your Ign ?
---
You mean ex-players that didn't click the unsub button?
---
Same thing happened to me
---
My ticket status went from “awaiting agent” (or something like that) to “investigating”
---
That seems hopeful
---
Did you get it?
---
This is absolutely inexcusable. They are treating their remaining loyal player base like garbage.
---
Wtf I was at work. I needed literally one only 1000 more exp.
---
Yea seems so
---
LoL
---
He means the timing. The Nuke Codes reset at midnight GMT on Wednesdays now. Since they moved the day
---
Cool reply. Makes sense.
---
That actually got moved, recently. Its now Wednesdays after they had a snafu where they didn't reset at all a few weeks ago.  But its the timing is right.  They reset at midnight GMT Monday \\7:00pm est Sunday
---
I’ve personally had fantastic performance with private servers so far. The only time I get any issues is during peak hours in my city.
---
Have you recently messed with your settings, or upgraded any hardware?  My buddy got a new graphics card and had to fiddle with his settings/software quite a bit to prevent crashes.
---
Wow....... I was literally almost done..... and 
---
 All of a sudden the tracktor on the challenge stoped showing up for my os xp points, It happened about exactly around the time you posted this..... they said the 12th.... all I needed was less than 1000 xp points to reach 14k points,  I took their word, and spent time on trying to get it and now I feel failed and disappointed with the people who are really running this game and especially with this situation  with me spending my time in getting something that is promised but is actually not. 
---
This is a BIG LET DOWN!
---
Because shitheads keep pouring money into the coffers? That’s my guess.
---
I wasn't at work, but only 1k away myself. Been playing since yesterday, and I don't play NW. So I had a long way to go as of yesterday. I was level 1 when I started out. I'm level 14 now. 1k, seriously, just like 2 games away.
---
Yea I can, fuck em I hope they get hit by a bus.
---
Ahh ok
---
No joke I was less than 500xp away......
---
Same, granted I started alittle earlier. I don’t play this mode and I have absolutely hated every second of it.
---
Its becoming a joke £60 for a game and its barely even stable let alone finished. 
---
There should exist some legislation that bans companies from lying about the game theyre making simply to scam you into preordering
---
It’s meant that I succeeded in finding something quite unique 😁
---
in another thread about this someone said they were like 42xp away. shit’s nuts
---
I had less than 500 xp to go...! 😡
---
Mandarin, ***also known as Standard Chinese***, is one of the [Varieties of Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varieties_of_Chinese).
---
Did you even read the first sentence of any article I linked? Or, did you just ignore them all so you can keep feeling smart?
---
You're not stupid. Getting inconsistent info is all. 
---
Was it to end with the update tomorrow?
---
Is it tied to Eastern servers?
---
Or is it that they set it to GMT? 
---
If it was set to GMT, was it stated anywhere,that they challenges ended Nov. 12th GMT?
---
Someone's a little salty
---
Seems a bit rushed, much like the game’s release...
---
It was very, different. I liked the fact everyone was on an even playing field. Balanced really well! I was surprised. I was able to make it to 2nd place many times, but not first once. 😂😂😂 Won't be playing anymore though. Enough of being ine with the bush.
---
Except they base every event off of EST time. For example mischief was stated to end Nov 12 at 12pm EST. If they had a precedent for basing it off of Central then ok but they don't so.... don't quit your day job.
---
Grinded all that XP in one night, if you win you get like 1,000 XP and they also gave us like more than a week to get the skin. Maybe they made it like that so it’s harder to get? What the point of it having a deadline and being a special outfit if everyone can get it easily.
---
Deadline is one thing. Ending it on the 11th a day sooner is completely another.
---
No, you can't. That's why the person in the OP used those camp letters to actually spell out all their messages. Some people use those to get people to add them on Discord, but neither option is exactly practical. Especially if you just want to talk to someone during an event, or something.   
---
There is no way to message someone through the game. When you select someone on the map you can invite them to a group, add them as a friend (which still gives no way to actually message that person), mute them, block them, or report them. I suspect your ability to message them uses the built in Xbox messaging system, the Bethesda Launcher doesn't have anything like that.
---
From my side of the fence (PC player), PS4 is by far the worst platform. If I ever bluescreen from any application, I've got some major issues. Having said that, I've never bluescreened while playing Fallout...any version. CTD's, yes, tons of them. But bluescreen? No, never.
---
I have zero issues playing Fallout 76 nor Fallout 4. Fallout 4 can give me the most issues, but that's due to mods and dirty files. Once files are cleaned and load order is sorted, all is well.
---
I'm not a console player, so I can't say that PS is at fault, nor can I say Bethesda is at fault. What I can say is that I've had to clean all of Bethesda's major .esm's (Skyrim &amp; FO4). I can say that a bluescreen is usually related to hardware conflicts with the software it's trying to execute.
---
Did you ever think it might have been accidental?
---
But arent they in texas...?
---
Yeah they can't blame on Day light savings , it was too many hours from true end.
---
I feel like it is closer to about 350 or so, but yeah, that is the idea. With super duper (and an alcoholic drink to boost my luck) I walk away with about 800-900 smelted lead.
---
😭
---
Don’t they usually ends things like that
---
People who preorder are also fucking things up.
---
Two shot sucks, I only buy it to flip it for profit.  I never want to actually use it due to the HORRIBLE accuracy.
---
Lol. 
---
If BGS had made the game they announced at e3 i wouldn't be mad. But its not that game. Its a p2w BR game with some survial mechanics. Exactly what they said theyd avoid
---
If I were writing this, I'd make the request have the same data but the response is either a list of servers or a server ID that transaction locks the site so you don't join a server only to find someone camped there milliseconds before.
---
No, they usually end them at noon on the date.
---
Now only if they would completely remove the NW mode. Fuck battle royale modes.
---
"But i'll quit if theu remove it."
---
Good, fuck you.
---
WTF Bethesda I was so close also!
---
Instigating Exploding or Instigating VATS50 Lever are the best sniper rifles for full health.  Bloodied Exploding or Bloodied VATS50 are the best low health sniper rifles.
---
Damn bro that sucks ass hopefully it was a mistake? Or is it really gone?
---
socializing in this game has a lot of barriers.
---
1. the team invite join is clunky.
---
2. Team mechanics are exploited by pvpers. The face guy joins your team. shoots his actual friend to initiate pvp. his actual friend kills you.
---
3. the audio is clunky, being in a team in auto takes you out of open into team chat. changing the chat mode is a pain. 
---
4. many peeps also use discord or TS and aren't in open. 
---
5. I have a small brain. A friendly conversation causes me to do dumb shit like throw out all my fusion cores with the rest of my scrap ammo.
---
6. even if you manage to get a team together chances are someone will disconnect. 
---
7. pvpers also exploit the friend list. the "face guy" pretends to be your pal and gets added to your friend list. he then serves as recon and a bridge to your server for the strike team. this includes access to your private server. 
---
8. Loading screens suck, load screen for fast travel load screen for going into a building. when you add friends to the mix that means load screen to go to a friends server as well.for awhile I was part of a player ran brotherhood faction we spent a ton of time just server hopping trying to get on the same map. I eventually got tired of playing the load screen game and just quit. 
---
All that being said I do have friends in the game. names I have been seeing since launch day still show up. I don't seek them out they don't seek me out we just know each other. we aren't even on each others friend list. its like a nice surprise. we catch up and then go our separate ways lol. 
---
  What works for me overall is just keeping lone wanderer perk on. not joining teams or adding friends and using open mic. I show up and help randos, have convos, all the social stuff. I just dont bother with trying to make long term friends. the long term friends have just sort of naturally happened. ie yesterday I introduced my wife who is fairly new to an old friend who started with me at hour one. He needed an upgrade on some high level armor and knew I was trustworthy to just hand over legendary armor peices. To be fair I would trust him with my most valuable crap if I needed to as well. so yeah its not joining up on teams and searching through load screen after load screen friend level. but I consider that guy a friend.
---
Thank you! I love you! I...love you?
---
Yeah I’d also like to know why you aren’t allowed to name that subreddit. Likely corrupt mods (on either side don’t wanna get banned on here) but who knows
---
It could be luck. Both the Mothman and Flatwoods Monster have specific spawns and have a 5% chance of spawning there when you enter the area. It's possible they'll increased the rate but why would they not mention it?
---
If you're team is on a server where your C.A.M.P isn't available, you'll be in a different server without them - OR - you can have them all join one whe your's is available [but no guarantee that their's will be available]...
---
It was cut early for like no reason
---
&lt;3.
---
At this point I'm really just starting to think this game is one big social experiment of how much bullshit people will tolerate
---
What in Todd’s name is going on ugh!
---
Same. My heart dropped. 😐
---
If you are on PS4, I have plenty of all 5 outfit variants for cheap in my Nuka Cola Outlet shop.
---
6pm for us, Mountain.
---
I hop it isn't gone yet, I'll check tomorrow morning though just to be sure.
---
postmodernist...
---
I don’t get how you guys are still surprised when Bethesda fucks up. That being said this really sucks and I’m genuinely sorry you have to deal with this bullshit.
---
Apparently so, I was at 1.1k away from getting it early and was gonna complete it tonight.
---
I have one...what are you offering for it?
---
You've tried your best to work with Bethesda.  And you failed miserably!  The lesson is:  never try.
---
-Homer, probably
---
Can confirm, one run through Blackwater mine (without Uranium Fever) picks up around 1000 steel, not sure if that’s inclusive of weapons though.
---
Honestly I don’t know what it’s worth but I’ve got a couple thousand caps
---
But they did. They literally admitted to ‘misleading’ Australian consumers. 
---
Their words.
---
I thought it ended on the 9th.
---
I held the ammo factory from a dude for three hours before getting bored and leaving the server. The guy has been joining my game and harassing me for the past two weeks. He’s tried to steal from my acid extractor, he’s tried to lead a behemoth to my house and one time he actually tried launching a nuke directly on my house. 
---
Just because your shitty stealth-auto-sniper build didn’t work on one guy doesn’t mean you follow them for two weeks.
---
I’ve blocked him but I think he’s using a second account to target me.
---
When they take the servers down for maintenance most weeks, right?
---
Add me to the confused and sad club.
---
I'd like to know too, been wanting to make an Enclave plasma rice that's NOT automatic, seeing thats usually what drops from events &gt;~&gt;
---
Im on Xbox, that sucks
---
Xbox
---
This was a feature in the original Fallout.  Clearly far beyond what Bethesda could do.
---
(On a serious aside, I'm glad they at least let you type in keypad numbers using the number keys...so it's baffling that such a rarely encountered feature would get numpad support but something as common as setting cost or quantities wouldn't be...)
---
Nooooo!
---
No it was posted for the 12th I earned the 7k one today
---
I need a clone please.  I made it to level 6 with zero player kills.  Then gave up.
---
Yup. I got the 7k reward today but now it doesn’t show the glowing skeleton outfit
---
Who is downvoting my post? It was scheduled to end in the 12th you fanboy
---
It absolutely does stack. I've tested speed demon+15%faster reload+ground pounder3 and they all stack on my lever action. Also have tested speed demon+quick mags+ground pounder on my handmade and that stacked as well
---
Literally just logged in and went to play a match to get the rest of the 1.1k xp or so I needed left just to see they ended it.
---
Well considering every time has been eastern, in the USA, why would they randomly change it for this one event ya ding dong
---
I'm not paying for the ability to play online on top of my internet bill.
---
My base is NW of the satelite relay tower. I usually run through Westek, clearing all of the mutants, and collect **everything**. Scrap eveything before leaving. Leave through the rear door, clear the 4-6 mutants there, looting and then slow walk NW to the satellite relay tower. Clear the mutants there, collecting/scrapping everything. I can usually pull 1-4  legendaries and about 500 - 800 steel with scrapper.
---
you are most likely being downvoted because numerous other people have made topics like this that the event ended early
---
take a shot or two and let them pile up!
---
Yep - same here - was hoping to grind out this today and it has gone
---
I rarely get a "depressingly empty server. maybe 1 out of 10 is depressing empty they seem to come in three types for me. 
---
the lowbie servers with a bunch of lowbies just a few high levels and flatwoods shops, if I launch a nuke I know I will probably get some good chaotic entertainment burn a lot of ammo and be in for a good long fight followed by some after action drama and wailing. 
---
the high rent servers there's a bunch of shops right next to white spring with overpriced everything's. every dot I see is level 300 or higher. If I launch a nuke on those I know I better be there when the nuke drops cause that queen will go from hole to dead in under 2 minutes. 
---
the just right for me servers, a random mix of lowbies and high levels spread out with good shops all over the map. if I launch a nuke there I expect the queen to go down pretty quick and to witness some good family friendly type interaction between high levels and lowbies. 
---
pvpers use team to loophole pvp mechanics to gank people with. player A is friends with B and invites player C to join his team. player A then shoots player B to start pvp and player B then goes and murders player C. 
---
   If you send me a team invite that's the primary reason I reject it. the other reason is I use lone wanderer perk. if I accept it means I will have to swap to inspiration. it means we will probably go somewhere and do something and you'll probably be disconnected, or you'll get a phone call, or something else that wastes my game time. I dont reject your team invite because I don't like you. I just know that more than likely teaming up with a rando is going to probably waste my time. THAT BEING SAID I explain things to people in open all the time and do group related events and such. ie we dont need to be on the same team for me to ask someone how to do something or explain how to do something, also if you get downed in my area I am gonna stim pack you. 
---
LOL usually people standing in their camps are sorting inventory, stocking vendors, or they are building. 
---
public events are constant you have to ignore them from time to time in order to do anything else. also if you go there first other people see the dot and are more likely to join you you. I map watch. seems like once one dot goes a bunch more converge on it.
---
Keep your pipboy light off. Shadowed armor is nice for smeaking around.
---
I was a 100 away from pumpkin paint for my combat rifle. I took a break and they fucked me 😖😫
---
Don't worry, I'm sure it will be in the Atom shop soon.
---
Nice, i just got the game a couple weeks ago so no i dont think ive done it
---
Well that is terrifying
---
What about the cappy shirt and jeans, do you know how to get that
---
I encountered two Mothmen and a Flatwoods Monster this afternoon.
---
Lights off constantly
---
considering how many saves nexus broke before I uninstalled it  there's no way in hell that software is getting near my online game. 
---
the problem I have with nexus is the mods are pretty darn touchy and it is really easy to make a mistake and wipe out a lot of service. I will keep my 76 vanilla just like my fallout 4. the game ran better vanilla.
---
Oh wow are you on xbox? If do I would like to buy a couple pieces of armour from you
---
**Relevant pro tip:** The *Surface to Air* events in the bog can spawn unlimited scorchbeasts. I run a loadout that is purpose-built to one-shot scorchbeasts, so when I see an event going off in the right location, it is ON.
---
If you want to break out of interior cells, using VATS on ceiling mounted turrets with a melee weapon can clip you through the roof. I managed to get outside the interior of the Mama Dolce's bunker like that.
---
They shouldn’t have released it without those features. They knew what they were doing but wanted a snag a couple Bethesda shills without really doing any work
---
Please, good sir, in my second paragraph above, I do agree that there should be naming and shaming.
---
It is just that the naming and shaming should be done not by a random FO76 redditor, but by a panel of trusted community members/moderators that are knowledgeable in what constitutes as a "cheat".
---
If the only condition is to "post a video of proof", it will lead to more problems, simply because players will only post their side of the story, which is often catered to make the other party look bad, and many innocents will be lynched by the mob mentality.
---
Take for example:
---
* I post a video of a "cheater" who got a bunch of kills right at the start of the map, for 2 matches in a row.
---
* All the video shows is "player XXX killed so and so", and that sentence repeated several times for the kills he got right at the start, across 2 matches.
---
* Reddit bandwagons and blocks that "cheater", agreeing that that's a "cheater" because the kill-rate seems similar to those who cheat.
---
* In reality though, that "cheater" actually chose a risky spawn location near a large crate, and got lucky with a missile launcher twice. That netted him a bunch of kills early on. But the video that was posted showed none of this.
---
If you allow the random player to name and shame, you'll get tons of videos like the above. Players getting killed by crossbows, posting about it as a "no gunfire cheat", other players claiming some "weapon spawn cheating" due to lucky weapon spawns, or an "explosion cheat" as there's no way a grenade's radius should hit behind certain obstacles (except that it does hit due to position lag). Or many other cases where things look suspicious due to lag.
---
That's why the random community member shouldn't be allowed to name or shame.
---
That's why we need a blacklist, and a panel of trusted community members/moderators in the know that will review or filter such evidence prior to naming and shaming a cheater.
---
Nah man, life happens. I tried to get a game or two in this morning before the kids woke up. My toddler found me at least an hour before he's allowed to wake up. No NW this morning for me. Oh well.
---
You brought snacks right?
---
i havent seen em in months
---
I have a feeling that we'll never actually get to play Wastelanders , hope i'm wrong. Looks like GRRM's book, The Winds of Winter.
---

I am in your boat as well. I have tried stealthy characters a couple times but always get fristrated with how gimmicky it is. 
---
currently my main is a heavy vamp laser gat PA user. I just finished a spare set of X-01 with stealth boy mod. I have found with my regular PA I can get a lot of ranged sneak bonuses against long range targets such as scorchbeasts / drones etc. so my intent on my next few days is to try out the stealthboy power armor to see if its worth not having jump jets. 
---
my thoughts are mostly around melting the drons with the nuke cards really fast. I already succeeed in stealth attacks fairly often with my jetpack armor. maybe the stealthboy x-01 will be good. 
---
FYI i have gotten a lot of bursts into a drone before detected with a laser gatling . thats why I am exploring the idea further. the range has to be just right i am thinking with stealthboy I can get closer ? meh I will test and see. on the plus side if stealth does break I am already in PA with a mingun /shrug.
---
I am terrible at NW, too.  I can get around 300 xp per match just by hiding on the edge of the safe zone until some hacker shoots me from nowhere.
---
Or until I stumble onto someone else by accident.
---
4k?...have anything to trade?
---
100% agree.

As a free player icon to make amends.
---
There's some people that just buy up anything cheap and then resell them at exorbitant prices - it prevents other players for snagging up these items.  I'd say a way to block them from vending machines would be a great QOL improvement for a lot of people.
---
They dont have to. But they should be at least consistent with event endings.
---
Whitespring Clubhouse has been bugged for stealth for months now. I can sit under anything’s nose with 24 AGI but the minute I go in there I’m a magnet.
---
I won twice and had several high kill games I’m salty af
---
What are you expecting from fo76. People need to boycott it otherwise they will just keep on shitting on us.

Let’s go storm their HQ !!! Everyone that agrees say “Aye”  It’s time for a revolution my fellow fallout friends!

What does being a subscriber to Fallout 1st have to do with your camp position?
---
Literally same experience here! Well no high kill games but two fucking wins! I don’t even like nuclear winter. Just trying to grind this out in two days I got 2 level ups between yesterday and today.. dude I normally don’t mind Bethesda fuck ups so much but this one affected me personally like gahh
---
I was also less than 1k away. Utter bullshit that they end it early. I literally just earned 980 for a match win a few mins ago realizing that I was screwed from it.
---
[And the vault 79 entrance :P](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm5dmt/vault_79_entrance_discovered_keypad_and_elevator/)
---
It doesn’t even make sense why they would schedule it and end it early
---
people complained when they launched that they launched to early. Me? i was glad they launched when they did. I have enjoyed the hell out of this last year bugs and all. 
---
I want camp budget and workshop persistance as well and they are coming. in the mean time I get to use junk box and survival camp. both of which are good for me. 
---
are you a person or a robot have you been programmed to have a response to being called an astroturfer. if you are a person is this just an alt account or is its a mian account and you just have alts. 
---
if you are a person man you are a whiney dude.
---
Cause it was probably a glitch or mistake. Smh
---
I am a robot, if you ask a robot if they are a robot by law you have to tell that person you are a robot. 
---
I have been programmed to make your life HELL
---
Do you seriously think I’m a robot dude? How do I know you aren’t a robot programmed to defend evil mega corporations blindly? By law you have to tell me if you are
---
Or they are posting these schedules on gmt without including that in their descriptions...
---
the costume challenge/cake is always a lie..................... they were tough by Valve.
---
"I am a robot, if you ask a robot if they are a robot by law you have to tell that person you are a robot"  LOL thats funny as hell. its just all i ever see you do is bitch about bethesda. it seriously seems like you are the opposite of a shill. I dont uderstand why you keep bashing a game you dont like and play. move on to the next game already.
---
It was finishing up to get my skeleton outfit and the challenge disappeared... WHAT GIVES? Did someone set it to end at the wrong time or something?  
---
Spent a lot of time grinding it just to be so close and to have it end suddenly.
---
Dude I can’t say how upset I am. Mmmm normally I can shrug off whatever happens but this sucks. I’m not joining the fuck Bethesda train but gah I’m just so frustrated
---
But agi is better than per, would rather have more points in agi
---
^ Underrated post.
---
please uninstall, quit and take your whining to a different game.
---
It happens. Usually lower levels feels justified in taking your stuff as they believe you have a good stash and won't miss it.
---
This.. 
---
I’ve tried to always take up for the devs preferring to blame the execs for all the bullshit. All. The. Bullshit.

Inexcusable

Trick or Treat, guess we all got tricked.

Would of been nice if there was a countdown like the daily/weekly.
---
Higher levels not by much but enough to be irritating.
---
I'm 36 and I still tear it up in twitch fps games like doom (and soon, Doom eternal). Age hasn't slowed me down, and I agree with the other posters about the fact that it's use it or lose it...now, where did I put my controller....
---
You can keep your points where they are. Agility should be for perks like dodgy, ap related, sneak related. Rifle and pistol dmg perks should be in perception. If you run 9 pistol dmg perk points you could move those to perception and free up 9 points for sneak perks. As it is right now, pistols are useless when compared to the versatility of rifleman perks+ sneak perks
---
Ah nope I remember now I did post history. we have actually conversed already.
---
You received Trick
---
Because it’s my opinion. I love the franchise but I don’t understand all the dick riding you do over a game that is broken and misleading in almost every sense. 
---
You can like the game or not. You could quite literally fall off the face of the earth and I would not care. I didn’t ask you to comment with your shitty opinion about how you like a shitty game. The only thing it shows is you are probably as bland and tasteless as your game preferences. 
---
Please for the love of god go away and stop harassin me on the internet
---
a few weeks
---
think of it this way. beth delayed launching the DLC so they make sure they "get it right"  . so of course people complain that they arent doing it fast enough. if they do what it takes to stop you and people in your faction from complaining other people will just complain about something else.
---
Tbh pistols are useless anyway due to their low damage output compared with any rifle. They need a buff all the way around imo. Their specialty perks are the most useless compared to any other weapon type
---
Less damage output compared to rifles is balanced in weight. Pistols weigh 1/4 of most rifles
---
If your on Xbox and find them again let me know I have not been able to find them 😭
---
I do store it. It was the stuff I got while in the zone itself.
---
Pretty sure the shirt and jeans was in the atomic shop

"If they took TSE out maybe, but they didn't." 
---
What do you mean? Can you rephrase that properly please? 
---
Are you saying you don't know if they took TSE out?
---
I didn't knooooooowwwww the gun was loaded!
---
\&gt; we're nearly at the point now where 76 existed last year.   
---
Elder Scrolls Online first year was basically just bugfixes and QOL improvements while getting ready for console launch. It took them a whole other year after launch before they finished the overhaul that actually made the game good.
---
That song is kind of a bop though so I don't mind it too much

No.

---
Dank, that sucks
---
👋 see you in wastelanders.
---
They can't stop us all!!
---
dae killed me cow.
---
I might be there man 👍🏼 not sure depends on how BGS conducts themselves over this next few months. Not gonna continue to support a company that can’t even bother to keep a simple date for an outfit that plenty of this sub missed out on cause they can’t bother to look at a calendar lol
---
I don’t mind being asked if I want to change worlds if my camp site is taken but don’t keep placing my character in the same world repeatedly.
---
It makes those that set up camp there target you
---
Boo
---
Yup. I’ve been busy so I saved it for today just to find out BGS took it away a whole day early and now I miss out on what I thought was a really cool outfit. Like you said life happens I’m not gonna get twisted about it but I’m just done playing for a bit. Not gonna keep supporting them when they can’t bother to care about us.
---
Yup I double checked their site. ALL Halloween events are posted as ET time ending. The skeleton reward does not have a specific time zone referenced 🤷🏻‍♂️ BS
---
What are timezones?
---
Here here grab the pitchforks and torches ! ⚔️🔥
---
They just need better perks for pistols. Lots of people have thrown around the "cowboy" build ideas, based on heavy revolver and lever-action use. Perks supporting that set-up would be handy. They could also focus on a pistol's primary use as a sidearm. A damage/fire rate boost to pistols when switching from a recently-fired rifle would be great for commando builds, saving ammo and producing a more natural combat feel. You really don't want to buff them too much, but improving perks to support their use would expand combat quite a bit.
---
Its ok, you can get those rewards paying the next month subcription /s
---
That must be all the ghouls in there....
---
Currently if you die after Scorched Earth ends (no longer in the event) you lose all flux. Just deleted. Poof. All other junk is in a bag. I love dying to acid from some creature immediately after the queen dies.
---
BERKIE THE TURKEY MASCOT OUTFIT
---
Mid to late march i'd expect it. Only thing i'm worried about is if we get the full content that was promised. Also worried about if there is anything they are going to add between now and then. Games been out one year and still no new weapons added. :(
---
In the whitespring area? I did not fight a scorchbeast.
---
Semi related but has anyone else had groups follow them around and try to get them to initiate pvp just so they can take junk? Or is it because I'm on a fresh toon trying a new build?
---
Certain situations cause you to be locked on by spawned enemy’s no matter what unfortunately. One situation is when your at the SBQ and she lands she spawns a wave of enemy’s and those enemy’s always know where your at even when it says caution. Also the meat week waves would auto lock you. 🤷🏻‍♂️ it sucks.
---
I just meant nukezones in general. This is most likely to happen at Scorched Earth, but flux probably deletes from other deaths too now.
---
In all fairness, I'm not sure why you would think it would end as early as it did.
---
That's exactly it. ALL servers should be stabile, but if they want to use the excuse that they need more money to fix this and FO1rst memberships are supposed to help with this, then they should really rethink their business plans before trying to carry them out. I'm not going to stop playing the game because I love it. But it sure would be nice for everyone that has bought this game to get what they paid for. I don't think there's a sense of entitlement coming from FO1rst members, but rather more broken features to a game that hasn't been stabile since launch so more outrage because they're (we're) not getting what they said we would.
---
I want to role play Bethesda on this one.
---
Here i go..
---
Hahah asshole!
---
Lol they never cease to amaze me.
---
Even with the pistol damage perks rifles out DPS and out range them by a long shot. Rifles can use mister sandman and sneak perks too. Here's a damage calculator if you don't believe me. [Link](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
I’ll be on tomorrow at 7 eastern time  and will trade the plan for the shotgun and shells if you want
---
I'm not on PC. I'm on xbox one. But I really appreciate the suggestions and support.❤
---
I believe you. My only counter point is they weigh 1/4 the weight most often
---
Weight is a non-issue for most experienced players.
---
Yep. I'm not asking for too much of a buff. Just allow us to use pistol dmg and sneak perks together
---
Except for one. The BE Western Revolver hits for 600 without Adrenaline kicking in.
---
Well ill be sure to share it then
---
You're* 👹
---
True lol, I should have said that I figured the Fallout franchise is great...and what you're saying is an awful truth....but true nonetheless. I haven't lost faith yet, but getting there.
---
Yes and the BE Railway and Lever action hit harder with a much higher fire rate.
---
Very true. The longer it goes...the less stable.
---
God that’s so dumb man!
---
True, but the weight holds them back. With 90 RW, you'll be hurting a little bit from the weight. Also Vats cost is really nice with the Revolver, allowing me to reload 5 times in Vats without exiting. 
---
I agree with all the other points on this post about pistols however.
---
But when we talked about multiplayer, I think many of us wanted something like Borderlands: one player owns the progress, other players can drop in and out with their characters. 
---
Instead we got something that wants to be like Rust or Eve (in terms of the players creating the economy), but doesn't have the size to do that or the willingness to be cut throat about it.
---
They're all Big Iron if you play Big Iron on loop OP *taps head*

I’ll give you 2k for you loss hmu it’s ok

Jimmy Dean is probably way more expensive than he needs to be
---
I killed a legendary SB last night while a level 26 snuck in a few shots (which I'm more than fine with) I died once and decided to get my loot after the kill, right when I went to go retrieve it, the little bastard just took it and left.
---
Oh no its ok thankyou tho :). Plus you probably arent on xbox haha.
---
Thats rough man :(.
---
I’m on Xbox, I like to help
---
I’m on Xbox, I like to help aha
---
It just works !
---
They are on record saying December
---
It got pushed back. It’s releasing alongside the Wastelanders DLC, which got pushed back along with it.
---
I didn't have anything crucial, but still, I basically got him a free legendary.
---
It's definitely not a full year. They said in an interview that it wasn't on their radar I think March/April?
---
I think somewhere in the middle of the development of the game before it came out haha they just act like npc was an afterthought
---
It's just junk honestly. Really easy to get. Yeah it may possibly you off but 90% of the time you have too much junk anyway.
---
Ok thanks, i couldn't find any information just by searching for it being on steam
---
oh thanks
---
Cringe
---
Y only 6hours today...u have had days to do this and yet leave it till the last day...whos fault is that
---
I don't care too much about nuclear winter, I just wanted the rewards. I had 7000 xp to grind so I picked today, my day off.
---
&gt; It's gonna be so disappointing ~~if~~ when they manage to fuck up wastelanders even after a push back.
---
Ftfy
---
100% agree
---
I think his point was just that Survival mode was removed because the player counts dwindled.
---
It's been the 12th for 17 hours..
---
Bad bot
---
I said this before but literally the only thing you can do is to server hop and check modus' terminal, he spawns an enclave plasma with different attachments each time
---
Doesnt matter if im on the game or not
---
It’s totally random. Last weekend was mostly one star drops, and tonight I already have three days worth of scrip and a new b/ffr/90 gatling laser.
---
If you just let it load the occupied world and then server hop it works better. But when you are at the menu wait A few seconds for the background image to change before starting another server search. This gives time to completely disconnect. Logging back in quickly will get you the same server. That is probably why the find another server option keeps giving you A server where your camp cannot be placed. It may sound crazy but it actually works. And I like to check out the occupants base. Maybe buy something raid his garden or something.
---
Uh Fixer, Bear Arm, Sheepsquatch staff and club, Shepard's Crook
---
Other people  are entitled to opinions that aren’t yours, thought gestapo.
---
The mods have explicitly said this. If YOU don’t like it YOU leave. Not hard.
---
So this is the one time Bethesda doesnt use EST?
---
I look forward to it.  I’m hoping the bow will be a really excellent, silent sniping tool.  It’ll be fun to have a new god roll weapon to hunt for.
---
Tenderizer too. No legendary version sadly.
---
And while in A private server traffic at your vending machines seem to drop off severely. One of the downsides. And playing alone with no NPC's is not much fun.
---
On xbox also...the frames get worse every patch these days
---
I agree about GTA V story being awful. And GTA IV’s story was great don’t get me wrong, but I think San Andreas’ story was 1000% better. Arguably their best story of the entire GTA series.
---
Where you being sarcastic? Because if you were that went right over my head. Lol Now I feel stupid
---
Yeah was mostly giving the ones that have legendary status. That's why I didn't include the Assaultron Imposter head :(
---
I was. The internet makes sarcasm a bit more difficult.
---
I don't care about proper Grammer nor proper spelling so your opinion is irrelevant.

I'm a solo bloodied build, and the vault 94 raid is crazy hard solo, would love to get in a group to try to get those rewards. Let me know
---
You think being able to afford 100 bucks a month makes you rich??
---
Awesome sounds good!
---
Seems like it.. That or they made it end on the 12th 12:01AM at night, which would make sense, cause it was still going last night for me (Aussie)
---
Lol yeah, I wish I could say this was the first time I fucked that up
---
Well, I guess the cat is officially out of the bag.
---
Notes from the next patch.... “ We gave some consideration to shotguns regarding the vampiric weapon effect, and decided some balance adjustments were needed. Our goal is to make the shotgun as ineffective as possible, so the vampiric effect will now only apply to one pellet per shot.”
---
This! I like to see what the other guy did to the camp location. Sometimes it gives me ideas for improvements to my camp. Sometimes, not!

You do realise every other company encourages you to recreate bugs so it helps them fix the problem quicker? 
---
But I shouldn't expect logic or reason in this subreddit.
---
If everyone is reporting on it, it generally means its true.
---
If something happens in the news, you dont call every reporter failed for covering the topic. So why do you do it to people on youtube calling out the constant fuck ups Bethesdumb make?

This place has more shills than any subreddit.

But they still are affected by the radiation? As in become glowing when they otherwise wouldnt?
---
Aye
---
I feel for all you players but why do you insist on giving Bethesda any more time of your day?
---
Less than a half completed game, broken promises, falsely advertised items like the canvas bags, nuka cola and the ill causing helmets, broken fallout first subscription.
---
Seriously, why?
---
Lol they are literally trying to get more of you to leave but time after time here we are.
---
It's happened to all of us. There's no death penalty in the game so, take it as a lesson. When survival servers came out, remember so many people lost junk and all aid they were carrying. Most vets have lost more caps and junk than we care to remember.
---
Yep. Procrastinators are gonna be mad
---
Good, love a gun fight here and there 😊
---
"bethesda literally bans people on video proof your argument is invalid"

"because they are slow as fuck and low tier support is usually bad"

For Bethesda, pretty damn hard. This is pretty par for the course.  At this point, I'm not even surprised, just sad.
---
They need armor pen and vats related perks
---
Incompetence does seem a lot more likely than some master plan to fuck everyone over.
---
some of you ignoring the fact that they used the words ‘future’ and ‘evolve’ - there is no guarantee what so ever when or if these things are ever coming.
---
When people fall to there death at my trap base I just eat them when there on their knees to kill then instantly then take their junk 200+ deaths and way over 20lbs worth of junk. Hope I see you out there ✌️
---
I agree. But even moving the 3 dmg buff perks to perception would be a step towards allowing pistol+stealth builds
---
I thought rose was just a standard miss nanny?
---
Like I was posting before, agility only goes so far. I only have 7 agility on my char and he's as stealthy as probably possible. You want a set of mods on your legendary armor. One piece wood, mod it shrouded. One piece with harder to detect while sneaking. One piece shadowed. You can mod the chest dense with the rest ultra-light for secondary mods. Muffled in tests (this is my opinion anyway) is obsolete by using escape artist. You need guns that have silencers also. The fixer adds in stealth too.
---
at least it isn’t likely to have bugs or plot holes
---
I can go in there now days, they don't see me at all. They run to me but end up sat all around me while stay in caution.
---
If you report on it dishonestly and need to manufacture outrage to get clicks and likes you are a failed reporter, wether you run a YouTube channel or are a talking head on TV.
---
If you break the rules without authorization you still broke the rules, regardless of if you did that to enrich yourself or catch a dangerous criminal. He used cheats without Bethesda's authorization,  so he broke the rules. Now they might lift his ban because he's useful, but it doesn't change the fact that the coverage of this issue is dishonest and thrives on pre existing hate rather than on what a tually happened.
---
If i could award you,i would have.
---
I'm rather scared for the performance tbh. The game runs like dogshit on what feels like an average of 15 FPS with next to nothing in the game to justify it while looking like a last-gen title. I'm afraid my PS4 will start burning  once they add more stuff.
---
Will you people go somewhere else and stop trying to make someone feel bad for the games they play?
---
How is the report dishonest? And the news report on things as details come in.
---
Bethesda is getting the flak it deserves. There is no need to manufacture outrage when Bethesda csnt go two months without fucking up.
---
Fyi just tried this again last night was maybe 3 dead glowings and 3 alive in entire burrows. Don't know why but nothing like it used to be...
---
It would be nice but I’d cry because that level 5 Quad Explosive Pipe Revolver Rifle wouldn’t be viable past a lower level anymore
---
Thank you for saying this
---
A no scrap is just that. Bulked scrap. Scrap it for all the individual scrap components. As for the raid I’ve only been able to complete it on novice as well. Any higher and there’s a timer which makes it hard.
---
That is correct they still become glowing and irradiated but just don’t drop flux components.
---
Bloodied Explosive is the weapon meta and sentinel/caviliers is the armor meta. Sent/Cav means you have 8% chance to take no damage while standing still/sprinting
---
Should of started grinding earlier
---
nah this is my subreddit for fallout 76 too. you are entitled to your thoughts and opinions. I am entitled to mine. I will tell them right back at you.
---
Nobody is saying autodirect it to a world where it is. They’re saying that if you’re given an option to find a world where your camp can be placed, it shouldn’t waste your time and find a server where the camp can be fucking placed instead of reloading half a dozen random ones and asking again

I have heard that unlimited junk stash is a sure way to win.
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
As you must have experienced, the in-game social systems are very unsatisfactory and make it hard to find people to play with and keep playing with them after a play session.
---
I personally lucked out with a Brotherhood of Steel clan / Discord community that has opened many doors for me.
---
Until Bethesda makes the in-game social systems substantially better, I'd suggest asking around in the FO76 reddit Discord or any other subreddits' FO76 Discords to find a group of people you would enjoy playing with me. You can also message me here on reddit and you can play with my clan.
---
yep I bash the queen with the box. I don't even have to play the game anymore.
---
Never reply to Danny. He's a longtime troll of this subreddit and I'm still shocked he hasn't earned a permaban
---
Im not trying to be rude, but meta is well meh. 
---
Case in point, I played for about two months after release and got to level 62 and was dirt pour with nary a valuable item except my urban scout mask. I returned to the game about three weeks ago and have just reached level 109. I also don't have any money problems. I generally buy and sell 10k during a session dont even sell to vendors anymore, not worth the grind.
---
What does this have to do with meta builds you might ask. I don't run a meta build, never have, never will. It's boring, imho, every joe shmo running a bloodied build, every fookin' clown running around in the same damn outfit. 
---
I play my way, my style. Still wreck stuff, and collect loot, either keep it, sell it, or scrip it to the legendary gods.
---
I'm just asking what I should look out for, I don't care about being the best but right now my best guns barely kill basic mobs
---
Ok, thanks
---
Technically they have added weapons. Not many mind you and mostly just melee weapons. I think there's only one gun that's been added since release but 3-4 melee weapons
---
People have a hard time telling with me irl so you're doing alright lol.
---
Pistols last longer in VATS but you get more damage per action point with rifles. I'll find the chart if you're interested.
---
Well nuking humans in Ned Vegas spawned them, so why not ?
---
The stash box is out of the meta. The fridge is now the game winning new king.
---
There are rewards that you're missing out on but only on novice. There are plans for two different legendary armours as well as a new set of power armour. All of these armours have a set bonus for wearing a full set.youll have to beat it on standard or hard to get those plans though and you're limited to 1 plan drop per difficulty per day
---
Seriously ??? This guy isnt banned yet?!? He is doing this for months now!!!
---
Unbelieveable .
---
How many plains in total? This is starting to sound like the possum badges but maybe not as bad
---
Good, because I was thinking about buying it today.
---
I tested it. It worked. If you don't want rugs under everything... 1. get a flat surface. 2. Put the bench on it, and a rug in front. 3. Blueprint the rug first, then the bench or whatever. 4. Store the bench and rug. 5. Place the blueprint where you want. 😉 https://youtu.be/PgIVA8sj2KA
---
Just nuked last night and found 2 or 3 dead glowings, maybe 4 alive in the whole burrows. And the usual robots at the end but 0 legendaries. Hopefully just a bad server and I'm hoping they didn't "patch" this too. Anybody else been in there while nuked lately??
---
How do you like to play? What's your killing style? Choose your playstyle build your char around that.
---
Myself, I like to play mix of stealth sniper at night, and frenzied maniac, emptying magazines into their face at close range.
---
Because that's the way I like to play, I dump points into
---
Rifleman, sneak, dmg reduction perks!
---
&gt; I figured it would help me show support to better development, bug fixes, and new content   
---
At this time all it showd Bethesda was that there are people out there who can be abused even more. Seriously folks, if you want better games don't reward the shitty ones.
---
This!
---
It's worse, there is one normal armor and power armor. You get like right hand plan here and left leg plan there, and you need ridiculous amount of Vault 94 steel to make the armor
---
Well , Bethesda is clearly doing nothing about the cheater's ,so what else is there to do if not raise awarness by posting video proof's? And maybe if enough people will get mad about it ,then perhaps Bethesda will finally take some action.
---
Honestly you should give it a try despite the bad press, I’ve played more well received games that are much buggier and worse. The problem is the game should have been Free-To-Play or Early Access and all the bad press would have been reversed just with any FTP or early access game, people will forgive the bugs under the assumption they’ll be corrected over time at the cost of a reduced price or being free. That said I’ve played every Fallout, minus the non canon ones, and I genuinely think this one has the best game space and I think when you actually get down and play the “story” it’s actually one of the best. The Fallout story’s have always been secondary to gameplay and really exploration and RP, for me, so saying that I think this game is one of my favorites because of that and well, I can play with my friends which means I have a reason to keep playing the same characters. Give it a shot if you already bought it, is it buggy like any other Fallout? Yup, but it’s damn fine fun.
---
How can it even be witch hunting when there is proof ?
---
This game is awful. I loved it at BETA and then it was a waste of time afterwards. If you listened to the community from the start things would be different. Obsidian is besting you at your own game. The Outer Worlds is a perfect example of what YOU should be doing. Starfield needs to live up to expectations... or else people will lose faith if they haven’t already. Your loyal fans are crying out that you take your time and do Elder Scrolls, Starfield, and Fallout 5 the right way. No micro transactions or any stupid 76 crap. You should have co op play. Would make it interesting. But no multiplayer. Ruins the experience.
---
If you are doing pvp and long range sniping, use the beam splitter. If you are fighting scorchbeasts, keep the beam focuser. Prime the gun always because ultracite fusion cells are nice and efficient to craft and makes the gun a lot better on queen fights.
---
Never use the beam splitter in vats, the damage goes way down, stick with the beam focuser if you like to vats. Always use "luck of the draw" to keep your weapon from breaking super fast and don't use bloody mess during pvp or else the person you killed can respawn with the godmode glitch.
---
Sorry for the slow reply, but I would argue that WOW at launch had enough content to justify the fee.
---
Then what ? My whole point is to raise awareness against certain player's who are using cheat's... because i personally would rather not play at all than waste my limited time on a unfair game.
---
Agree !
---
Hate to break it but starfield is the next release, es6 isn’t till 2022+
---
Becoming? You mean it was totally fine from beta and now it is becoming a joke?   
---
No wonder you are asking how do they keep getting away. Don't forget to sign for Fallout 2nd when it's out mate.
---
same. Save for the event spawn, ive not seen one since like last year...
---
I just want us to unite against it , since Bethesda does'nt care .
---
We can all unite and stop playing with them on the same server . We can server hop and choose not to play until every last one of them give's up and moves on to some other game .
---
People should stop saying so easily" i suck at NW" ... because i could bet you that 80% of the times ,those people just care across aimbot .
---
6×3=18 plus you can get a strangler mask and a vault 94 jumpsuit so I think that's 20 rewards all together. Plus theres a hand full of challenges for it. So far you've missed out on 3 weekly challenge exclusive photo frames but they might rotate them back through like they did with survival weapons.
---
You dont really think meat week caused all those cleavers to appear at a random train station, right?
---
Sound like you was getting ready to do some. hackin and wackin and smackin....
---
Country Roads and there’s not doubt about it
---
Yeh, there is no way I’m ever paying for XBL Gold or PSN. Nopenope.
---
Hands down, it's Country Roads.
---
How would you know if someone was running a bloodied build? (Genuine question, as I tend to run around and stimpack any poor person who needs it.)
---
I really love the Ring of Fire cover, but if we're talking songs that were originally in the game I'm going with Praise God and Pass the Ammunition.
---
There are people literally everywhere.
---
&gt; Idk how the fuck they fix this mess
---
That sentence could be used to explain the entire game to be fair.
---
Murmrgh is a woman.
---
What's NW
---
Fucking saaaame
---
So
---
Inside is not a nuke zone
---
I freaking love this mod. It’s completely changed the game for me and would not play without it at this point
---
Sixteen times the detail
---
I'm on PC and all it says is "Another player took your bag.", however, that's not what I was referring to. If I drop a bag when I die, the bag doesn't say "Sertith's Bag", so you can't exactly tell the level of the person whose bag you took.
---
Hayley Porter, one could wonder if they had problems with copyright :P
---
Since it'll be coming out in the first quarter of 2020, that means NPCs and story will be "top priority", for a little over a year, which is a good sign.
---
Really only had problems at meat week. Something turns off stealth there. Let me link you some videos. I know what you mean by wonky, you have to unequip and re equip. When it's working though, it should be good. On my bloodied, run the same setup and he's stealthy too, but the difference is with 5 chameleon, can re enter stealth by moving spots.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGlOxnSJbz8
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCKAUSHE_so &lt; you can walk in stealth by getting out of power armor while taking fire in danger. Even stays between loading screens. Works good for farming- not sure if they'll fix it.
---
No you are not. Has been discussed thousands of times already.
---
Yeah i was only 100 xp away from the skeleton
---
Maybe it is the trick in their trick or treat?
---
The same question has been asked for a million times, search the answer.
---
Combat armor skins was 1 of the only atom shop things I really liked for that reason. Didn't even appear using legendary machine 😂 but now with all vanguard scout armor don't have that option just need to be even more careful...
---
Please don't support Fallout 1st.
---
On the other hand, in agility they stack perfectly with evasive perk.
---
I would just prefer more pistols in the game, the choice is very limited.
---
The way I understood it. Unless you continue subscription the tent will stop working. You can still craft things using your scrap box scrap, but can no longer take scrap out, or put scrap in. All the atomic shop stuff you can keep.
---
I'd rather they didn't. But only because they currently have bigger things to worry about.
---
Sorry, but it kinda serves you right for supporting these greedy practices in the first place. I have no sympathy for you.
---
Same, 2k XP.......
---
Well screw that then.
---
The vault jump suit and raid mask are not in them drop pool, you get them the first time you complete standerd (jumpsuit) and expert (mask)
---
And there is only 5 pieces for each set,
---
Agreed.
---
So reskin of combat rifle and 4 meme meele weapons...
---
Welcome to Bethesdaland.
---
Broken in what way?
---
They didn't take anything from the game that I got before 1st was released, so I'm fine with their offer.
---
I never said anything about workshops
---
2pm local (to me).
---
Oh, do you mean are shotguns still aiming down sights preventing you from applying a stimpack or swapping weapons unless you reload first costing you precious seconds?
---
Yes. Yes they are.
---
My favorite song is Walking the Floor Over You.
---
So many different favorites. I didn’t anticipate so many people liking so many different songs. I guess that means the game has a good overall soundtrack. Perfect for the setting of the game
---
Why are you still here trolling around? You seem quite masochistic. You hate it, but still deal a lot with it. You're fucking up your own mood
---
Exactly. It doesn't pick my pockets or inconvenience me if someone else is paying like $12 for a luxury item or two that I don't have. I don't measure my happiness against anyone else's. That way lies only madness. If they want to support continuing development of the game and get a couple of little odds and ends, I'm not going to tell them not to. They're the ones who are paying for Wastelanders, which we'll all get to enjoy when it comes out.
---
Let *me* worry about that, son.
---
The person I was replying to said that the only reason he made his comment was to grab Bethesda's attention. I was saying that if that's the case then there are significantly better options available
---
Yeah, you're literally the only person.
---
I’m not hating on you, but what’s a better way? He said he can’t get a refund which would be the best way to get their attention, but like what writing a letter? They obviously go on this Sub or at least one person does.
---
Well server hopping will only do so much...the hackers will just join again.
---
I doubt someone would ever reproduce with you, grumpy old ass bastard xD
---
ok boomer
---
I think they're talking about the damage nerf and/or replenishing health bug.
---
I'm 32yo you dumb huge baby xX
---
These people never played FNV. They either don't know or are so wrapped up in their tiny bubble to realise how much heart Obsidian put into that game while Skyrim is a "streamlined" elder scrolls game the same way F4 was "streamlined" by a soulless corporation just cashing in on their IP. Do you know why everyone says oblivion is the better game? Because it is.
---
Skyrim is pretty, and you can have 2 swords, that's it.
---
Oofda I was all types of wrong
---
Idk ty
---
"Wait, you mean that if I don't keep putting gas in the car, it will just stop driving after a certain point? Screw that."
---
The real Stockholm Syndrome relationship in Fallout 76 is going from loathing to loving that song.
---
So you don't mind pay to win or convenience items behind a paywall for which you already payed money for with the initial price of the game?
---
You may be okay with that, but I'm not.
---
I'm pretty sure Bethesda could have stuck with customer friendly practices and released a polished product which people wouldn't have refunded and we'd still would have got Wastelanders.
---
Being shitty towards the less wealthy players doesn't make it okay just because they promise an update for which we're not yet certain will be actually good or not.
---
It's Sixteen Tons for me
---
So you're fully okay with this?
---
I like the way you see things :) cheers!
---
Oh, I thought you were referring to raider rose, sorry my mistake.
---
Was that not clearly sarcastic enough or are you just trying to make up things that were obviously not said?
---
You're really comparing furling your car towards a pay to win microtransaction for which should be free?
---
Instead if posting on an unofficial forum he could try Bethesda's official forum. Personally though, I'd just contact Bethesda's support team and talk to them about it. Most support teams would be understanding and give something in return, idk if Bethesda's would though.
---
Writing a letter and making a petition are kinda extra, but it's always a good start to just Google the company's name and see what comes up
---
Don't worry about it haha. I've spent a lot of time in there. And not many have, but I'm glad more people are asking about it and trying them out. I actually really enjoy them
---
That is really strange. A game should not be able to do that. I have had the game crash but the game just vanishes and I am back at the desktop. Actually having it bluescreen is a real problem since that means an error was caused in a kernel driver or hardware problem. Bluescreens put information in the event log. It may be worth it to look in there and see if you can find the problem in there and post that information.
---
"Pay to win." Are you kidding me? It's at most a mild convenience. 
---
This said: Everyone who buys a car knows that they're going to have to keep paying to keep it going. That's the nature of a car. Same here. It's a luxury you get to keep benefiting from for as long as you're interested in paying for that luxury. If you decide it's not worth that money, you stop paying and you stop getting that luxury. Like anything else that you don't really need but might decide that you'd like.
---
How would you suggest that Bethesda continue to generate new revenue and profit for this game in order to fund continued development of new content for it?
---
It happens when u lose well fed buff while having really low health, sometimes it can take u to 0 without killing you.
---
No, no it honestly wasn't.
---
How am I supposed to tell if that was sarcasm or not?
---
You realise that a word in written text doesn't have the impact as in voice right?
---
You could have written it like this: "Yeah, you're totally the only person. Like duh! (just kidding)"
---
Another dumbass that doesnt understand basics of pay to win mechanics.
---
You too, friend!
---
Why say this? My TSE bolt action stacks rifle and gun perks. Please don't take that away...
---
Yeah and it’s the first bloodied gun I’ve had with 250dr, is that effect buggy?
---
I thought that me asserting that you alone were the only person on the entire Earth out of over 7.5 billion to still think that the scrapbox should be free, on a sub where people are constantly talking about how the scrapbox should be free, would make it obvious that I was sarcastic. I'm sorry that my intention did not come through clearly enough.
---
Insulting me adds nothing to the discussion.
---
Definately. It’s the first mod I install in every Bethesda game when I go back and play. I like dark nights, I like the challenge being greater at night. Means the night is something to be feared. I’m a big dying light fan.
---
im nearby whitesprings on the nearby mountains 
---
i recently had 3 scorchbeasts at my camp... had to repair a lot
---
A setting for individual players would definately be a welcome addition
---
Buying a car and knowing to refuel it comes second nature to anyone.
---
Buying a microtransaction which doesn't directly tell the answer of it will continue or not after subscription is not the same thing.
---
But going forward stuff that should be in the full game will be hidden behind a paywall.  
---
Pretty much the only thing I trust Bethesda to do.
---
250dr is bugged, it will "cancel" any primary effect on reload and until re-equip.
---
Bro we have the option to pay for scrap/ repair kits, the scrap bot, wall papers, refrigerators, candy bowl, and the shit show that comes with fallout 1st. Bethesda dipped their toe in the water and others said jump on in with game altering microtransactions. So please domt expect anything to be free from now on except Icons, skins, and the occasional camp item. I find it funny that cosmetics are the only free things weel get now when that's what was supposed to be the only thing we were guna pay for... after paying for the game.
---
Maybe not be assholes to their players and stick to their promise of cosmetics only? I feel like none of this would have been an issue in the first place if they released a polished product, had better design features and didn't break something after every patch.
---
Am I an insane person for thinking that?
---
Yea I thought I heard somewhere that they weren’t causing much for damage so they were broken I never read that there was a nerf just thought it was a bug
---
I enjoy coming across peoples tents and using them for free
---
Lol that's every gun not just shotguns
---
+1 this, please!
---
Love uranium by the commodores 
---
https://youtu.be/I8AjDfpXFBc
---
Well in recent times everyone's been silent about it, so I was honestly wondering if I was the only one that cared anymore.
---
Also make walls act like electricity connectors, because, you know, we like to hide them inside walls.
---
Carpets but for walls. That'd be nice :)
---
It seems that this kind of quest doesn't universally break for everyone. For example, I've never had problems with Queen of the Hunt before, while for months on this sub people reported it not activating, while I had Boomer not giving me the location of the bombs. 
---
Lately, the scouts quests seem to be broken to some people, and while I don't remember which one is Pompy, those two quests work fine for me. On the contrary, Zeke down in Camden Park is broken for me. I have his quest and he keeps repeating his introduction speech, but never gives me the option to actually throw the thing.
---
Right on, I hate them honestly. I only did it a couple times as they were coming out and my old ps4 just couldn't handle it. So many bugs and waiting around made us lose anything higher than novice. But, my buddy got 1st so running them in private servers has made it more tolerable and I kinda fell in love with washout since I've been walking out with like 300+ acid without even trying to farm the crickets. They're a fun idea but until they get more stable I cant see myself doing it much. Oh and the whole thing about having to fast travel out is kinda bs imo
---
The only one that's a meme is the Crook. The other three are some of the highest damage weapons in their class. Don't think they're memes just because you haven't seen a good roll on them
---
I usually just charge in with full ultracite armour and a twoshot exploding double barrel shotgun while hall of the mountain king is playing on my pipboy.
---
I think you're right.
---
I really need to move on from this game, as much as I have enjoyed it.
---
I can't take this level of greed.
---
Yeah I've learned that trying to reason with idiots doesnt go very far.
---
Eh, I still enjoy it. I've just really lowered my expectations. I may jump ship if wastelanders is behind a paywall though. Theres no evidence of that, it's just my personal speculation.
---
Why am I not surprised anymore..
---
As far as I know, power armor has hidden damage reduction in addition to the displayed resistance.
---
I’ve added over 300 people to my friends list thru this games release, I’m at over 2200 hours and I’d guess I’ve played for maybe 20 hours outside of a chat party. It’s the least lonely game I’ve ever played :)
---
It’s complete garbage created by super villains. But at least it’s the closest I’ll ever get to being a home owner.
---
So… 8.36am yesterday? Better check the Bethesda website, oh wait…
---
Alright what the fuck. Now I cant prove those but I swear armor in general got nerfed before mischief night. Before the update I had buil my vanguards up to about 550 Bdr and now it wont go over 380. Its annoying but I've been taking fat damage the past couple of weeks.
---
Isn't this natural?
---
That’s the next perk with F1st :) lol 
---
(Really hope not that would suck)
---
Buch of bones tied together with duct tape I guess is meme no matter the damage it does.
---
For now, the brick wall is quite a good choice, giving the interior a special vibe.
---
Guess pipe rifles are meme in your view even though they do the highest damage
---
This game has hard single player experience at the beggining... it changes later.
---
For now, listen what some are already telling you: enjoy being alone, explore the lower level areas before going to others.
---
Except for Whitespring and Deathclaw island, usually the uglyer the area is, stronger the mobs are. If something drops a weapon you cant use, you shouldn't be in this area yet. Follow this and you probably will never lack ammunition or stimpacks.
---
dem haters are still talking about how unfair it is since release....
---
i agree, it sucks, but dealt with it and am now enjoying unlimited scrap 
---
shit aint gon change, better to give in and claim all workshops
---
I don’t know I’ve always used power armour. I feel like if I have such close DR in both situations, the difference in damage I take should’ve be so massive. It has to at least be 10x or more.
---
This
---
Events aren't worth it at all. Most useful thing you will get is some water, but you get too much of that shit anyway.
---
That might explain it. Bloodied weapons are going to be hit next lol.
---
Nope. What some people don’t get is that BGS said they couldn’t offer unlimited storage because it impacts the servers. However that statement is only true with unique items like legendaries etc. Since scar junk stacks it takes a lot power to load that into a server. So why did BGS lock it behind a paywall and not make it free quest related since wastelanders dlc is delayed?
---
Simple, Bethesda is in the middle of a buyout. And they need to show a steady income. Something cosmetic only based games can’t do. However subscription based income is a lot more stable. At the end of the day it’s all because of money
---
The junkies will rise
---
who are you referring to? the guy that exploited and got banned?
---
exploiting is bannable no matter which game you play
---
Gah crap. Guess I’ll have to store it until or if it’s fixed. Thanks.
---
Shotguns aren’t broken. They were heavily nerfed sometime ago
---
What do you think the word "subscription" means if not a periodic payment plan where the customer gets continuing access to the service in question so long as they continue to take part?
---
Same! No one mentions it but I felt it right away
---
I'm sorry, I think you misunderstood my question. Allow me to try again. 
---
The game needs to continue to be profitable in order for it to remain online. To pay for continuing development of new features, to pay for hosting and bandwidth and such. For that to happen, people need to continue to direct money to Bethesda for this game. What would be an acceptable way for them to get customers to pay for this game, if not something like this?
---
This seems less a secret and more like they were lazy enough to make the demo vault by copying and pasting a different vault then blocking doors
---
Moans about bugs, doesn't list or mention any bugs encountered
---
OZ OZ OZ OI OI OI
---
For anyone else coming here due the same problem, here's a tip: go to higher level events, people usually die, you just need to run and revive them.
---
In Ash Heap there is a good one where we fight an invisible bot - people die a lot on this one; the Halloween even (unfortunately gone) was specially good for reviving others too.
---
*Laughs from 500 meters berserkingly*
---
To quote from the fandom wiki: "The damage the player takes is reduced by a flat 7% per piece on the frame, while the radiation damage reduced by 15% per piece, so a full  set reduces damage by 42% and incoming radiation by 90%. Damage and radiation resistance provided by each piece is then applied to the  remaining amount." This is similar to how the SBQ has a flat 70% damage reduction before everything else is considered.
---
And given how resistances work in this game, an equal amount of DR reduces lower damage even further than higher damage (e.g. 100 DR reduces a 100 damage hit to 50 damage, but a 50 damage hit is reduced to *less than* 25). Which means that the same DR on a power armor is more effective than on combat armor, beyond and above even the additional 42% reduction.
---
So you test an exploit and then report it to Bethesda so it will get fixed, but what happens is that you yourself get banned. That seem like justice to you. Not to mention Bethesda owes everything to it's fan based contributors.
---
It seems like you are out of touch about what these drones in Bethesda do.....
---
Shenandoah...
---
TIL
---
Ok just for you I'll make a Lil list and if you want I can send you some gameplay so you can review the footage to determine what a bug is 😊
---
Random server disconnects (Obvious)
---
Gun random firing spray after certain reloads or shooting in vats.
---
No damage (still a thing)
---
Enemies not visible when spawned but still attack you
---
Buying from vendor but not getting item but still taking caps (player vending issue)
---
Graphical bugs with instead of textures be loaded the entire space is being loaded.
---
Want more?
---
Dying when doing manhut and attempting to respawn makes your character unable to move causing you restart
---
Opening pipboy when starting game can still freeze
---
Enemies sliding on the floor constantly in certain area
---
Menus and ui overlapping if you die with your pip boy out
---
I never specified a country so good job.
---
you are exploiting ,doesn't matter for what purpose you do it 
---
thats why you use an alt account for "testing" exploits
---
A nifty way of making interior walls is by placing two brick doorways back to back in the same spot, then changing them to solid walls. 
---
As far as I'm aware you can place wallpaper on to them while doing this to!
---
Says the one that can't do basic grammar and spelling.
---
Yes, yes you are, exactly that.
---
As if Bethesda has ever been fair in the past 2 years lmao
---
I'm not 100%, but I understand that you can take stuff OUT of the scrap box, just can not out anything thing in. You will still lose the tent, you will lose the free Atoms each month, but keep any free 1st exclusives from the Atom store.
---
Oh ok I swear I remember people saying it was broken beyond use so I never knew there was a nerf
---
No, pipe rifles make perfect sense. They are actual thing. But you would destroy bear skull hitting something with it... 
---
Funny how everyone is runbing with handmade/fixer since pipes are so good...
---
Sucks to be you, I haven't seen any of those in my 3 or so hours that I play most days. 
---
That being said, I am getting tired of the shotgun damage bug and the bug where your favourites disappear from the scroll wheel. Thing is moaning on here about it won't make the slightest bit of difference.
---
My native language is not English if you cant tell. But it seems that people that run out of arguments have to go to the grammatic side of things. Just sad that I took you over 2 weeks to think about that response
---
Jesus Christ. One thing after another after another with this game. Not even surprised any more.
---
Cut the servers by half price as they're clearly unstable and unpolished for launch and don't put massive gamrplay changing elements behind a paywall. Also, let's not forget that Bethesda already make a crap tone of cash of the Atom Shop in the first damn place.
---
I'm getting the sense that maybe you'd prefer them to lock more gamplay changing features behind a paywall just to support Wastelanders I presuming. I'm not okay with that. If this was a fully free to play game then I'd see that as likely more acceptable. But it ain't. People already payed $30, $60 or even $200 + and Bethesda tried to prevent their refunds for which is disgustingly wrong.
---
If the servers were half the price and there wasn't pay to win locked behind it then I'm confident that more people as well as myself would have bought into it and it would have profited Bethesda even more.
---
There's your answer.
---
If they where truly persistent and nothing else was included in fallout 1st, I would still pay for a subscription. As it is now, no.
---
Private worlds don't have randoms camping in your spot
---
Well that's the thing.
---
I knew it was required for the servers, but I wasn't sure about the tent and Scrapbox.
---
Lol... Every thread I see has comments of a bug and an exploiter that has been doing it since beta. 
---
You seem like a bigot with a big lack of empathy. Think about it for a moment. Like properly. Have you even read the reddit posts about the guy I am refering to who got banned unreasonably?
---
A gun that looks like if you shot it irl it would blow up in your hands is just as meme of a weapon that's Fallout humor lol
---
I regard the term "pay to win" in this context as ridiculous hyperbole. The most you get out of this subscription is a mild convenience. Someone else who has a little more junk to build with doesn't "win" and I don't "lose" if I don't have it. It just means that they're saving a little bit of time scavenging now and then. This doesn't make me "lose." It doesn't negatively impact me in any way. It doesn't pick my pockets if someone else happens to want to be the one to pay for continuing development of new features of this game that you and I and everyone else are going to be able to enjoy for free in the coming months anyway. 
---
People just want to be angry about everything. The internet is stupid.

You do get a bunch of stuff permanently; the ranger costume, the emotes, and a huge pile of atoms. Those aren't going anywhere. The servers, scrapbox and survival tents you get access to as long as your subscription remains current.
---
For that reason though, there is a benefit to have pistol perks under agility: this way they can at least be occasionally useful to characters with low perception but high agility. For example, someone specialized in strength/agility, and melee or shotguns may sometimes use a pistol at longer range. But if pistols were tied to the same attribute as an all around (other than weight) superior weapon class, that would give even less reason to use them after the early game.
---
Just Google pipe gun and read the wiki article that pops up among top results...
---
I know it’s not what you want exactly but the Camp system will make its own blueprint when you move your Camp (probably not your current Camp) it doesn’t work well and something you add can break it at anytime but it can work. I have a friend who has a little town of buildings he has been moving around forever and I built a Brahmn launcher to throw Brahmn at ppls Camps. It worked great but I had to store the Brahmn every time, I forgot once and it broke haha. It is possible tho :)
---
Nice.  Bonus points for outfit. 😁👍
---
Submitted my ticket. I'm starting to debate on returning my birthday gifts from the Bethesda store my wife got me. Ya know, don't want them to come up missing as well.
---
&gt;Simple, Bethesda is in the middle of a buyout
---
Proof?
---
*paid
---
Balanced well?
---
"Like Scoobs, he's right behind us, isn't he?"

How do you know how much they are making off the atom shop versus their operating costs?
---
If you post YouTube links to casuals you will be banned, trust me haha
---
They’re*
---
You can pay to get an open server, why would they give you it for free?
---
Yeah I know what a zip gun is, they're not meant for long term use and can deteriorate quickly, sometimes only being used for one shot. They also suggest testing the gun before firing it by hand. This pretty much shows that they can blow up in your hand and be just as worthless. Also you basically defined what a meme is by defending pipe guns as you did
---
Making a game is hard work, especially an open world one the size or 76, they made the mistake of putting a rubbish game engine in with 76 but it’s not that bad. Fallout 1st is another story which I’m very disappointed about, the scrap box should be free. Private worlds should be 5£$ a month. They do need to address issues in the game promptly and pretty much FIX the game, but again I can still enjoy playing the game 6 hours every day. Just my opinion this game can be a LOT better but it’s run by super villains, I know that don’t really care about the community.
---
How much did money did the game make?  Maybe it made a good amount that could fund dlcs?  Were sales as low as you’re implying?
---
I can hear the" well aahhktuaaly "from here
---
oooh I didnt think of the fridge. so if you get good with salt will that stack with the plus 50% from the fridge? I havent used it in combat yet. has to be a slow attack speed.
---
Recent times? Like the past 24 hours? Just scroll down.
---
He is the chosen one
---
The vault raids are soloable, but v difficult if completed this way
---
Thanks, I fixed the spelling error.
---
Oh yeah I know, I just don't have the build or the patience to do so :/
---
Well that's pretty fortunate, Ie been experiencing it with rifles and my cryolator.
---
Well I think we all believed they'd be solo-able based on the easiness of The Burrows
---
?
---
Is there any indication they have worked on it? Is there even one screenshot? It’s been a name and nothing else so far. They aren’t releasing a free sequel to the game in a few months
---
There are 12 plans total I believe
---
16 Tons. I will actually stick around an area if it is on the radio nearby.
---
Ok boomer
---
But it is the 12th..
---
You aren’t really answering my question, how do their sales compare to their costs? He asleep people by cosmetics, but the question is whether those sales are enough to sustain the game and fund future development.
---
I’ve made the same argument and have been met with ESO fanatics that will just defend and defame without making real points.
---
It really depends on your build. I launch nukes solo. Unfortunately I'm on PS4 or I'd help you out But if you have a good strong build then you should be fine. Just bring plenty of stims and ammo. You'll also need a hazmat suit or power armour because there's a section in the silo that's heavily irradiated
---
I'm a vats/semi auto rifle build. I'm always low on meds and ammo and guns are kinda ass. I actually have people to play with but they uninstalled the game lol
---
are you saying you don't think it is?
---
I'll bump up what ancientwolf75 said and upvote it too. To achieve your goal, make a doorway. Go to the other side and you will be able to make a second doorway on the same wall, same place. Then edit the walls to no longer have doorways. The menu for this feature is right next to where you would normally scrap or store the wall.
---
They have literally the worst cs i ever had to deal with. They will lie to you and outright refuse to help you even with gamebreaking bugs (i had the main questline break on my first character on lvl. 35; had to start over on a new char). 
---
after that they had the audacity to ask me how satisfied i was with their service. nearly lost it at that point
---
Scrapbox should not be a paid for luxury, it should be a basic feature of the game or discoverable in game. A feature is being held hostage for payment, it is shameful.
---
No we have 100$ tents and private servers
---
Theres quite a few variants. Got em all, and I'll absolutely give any to ya! Gt: apneac
---
Lmao
---
Yeah it's ridiculous, man. I brought up the fact that I bought and was disappointed that it was just a generic MMO with an Elder Scrolls skin and I got told that I should have researched it beforehand, even though I did I still expected it to behave a little like other ES games. At least F76 is similar to FO4 in the control sense
---
Scrapbox was the final straw for me. I could argue the ranger outfit was a cosmetic (exclusive irked me). Private worlds are a service I could expect to pay for (although not having the basic feature of privacy was kinda dumb, yet alone it should come with at least workshop persistence). But taking one of the most publicly complained about issues, the limited inventory system, and locking a solution towards it behind a paywall is shameful and gross abuse of monetization.
---
It shows many of their decisions have been to force grind and payment from the moment they started envisioning pay to win atom shop, and that started with perk nerfs related to repair and scrapping.
---
My tent and private server was $13.90. But I also got some cool emotes and a costume I would have expected to be sold around 1500 atoms altogether. Also ESO has a similar deal so it's more comparable to that
---
Some one explain the silo codes to him I’m not sure how to decrypt them... I just google the launch code for the silo each week
---
Statistical bias, you do not see the people who were turned off from playing at all. You see the people who boight the sale price and the people who stuck around which are more likely to be subscribers.
---
I’ve never heard of this eso, but it doesn’t sound good.
---
&gt; A feature is being held hostage for payment, it is shameful.
---
Why does this matter? If you want it, get it. If you don't want it enough to pay for it then don't get it. Decide for yourself what this very minor convenience is worth to you and then spend not one more second of your life contemplating it. 
---
I swear, the ridiculous, tiny, meaningless things that people choose to devote their leisure time to being angry about are just EXHAUSTING to me. Surely this isn't the best way for any of us to be spending our time. This is all so stupid.
---
And weel never have free items that implement new mechanics to the game ever again. Thanks for keeping this tumor growing.
---
Its not statistical, its my own experience. I noticed the drop in players, but the ones I do see are mostly subs.
---
Level 5 to 24 they are great....
---
At minus 32 health you become invincible. Todd said so.....
---
Simple, lower atom shop prices dramatically. The reason they avoid this is you earn atoms in game and they wanted the prices to feel far enough away that people spend to get a single item. I think the market for volume purchases is much higher, if they were cheaper some people would get more for in game grind but more people would buy atoms so they can collect stuff faster.
---
For sixty dollars you should be able to buy more than a couple power armor paints, an emote, and a clean fridge and water purifier skin.
---
Eso?
---
Nocturnal broadsiders, with faster fire rate. Seriously the new meta.👍
---
The wasteland.
---
God I hope thats the case.
---
Did ESO really dodge a bullet? How could you not be pissed about being triple monetised have a bunch of pay2win stuff?
---
I thought it would end with the event so got mine before. Dont know if I still have it since I havnt logged in since.
---
Oh no!!!!  No more silly hats and lame outfits. Whatever will we do??? 
---
Quit the game, I guess.....
---
I honestly don't expect anything too specific regarding Wastelanders until January.
---
Mine cost $8.33
---
You're welcome!
---
Same here. Love it and still pay but I do not expect things to improve much in regards to the base game or free DLC.  
---
If wastelanders is behind a paywall, I'll stop playing too.
---
Truth is...the game was rigged from the start.
---
They pull the whole "well X did it", as if it's meant to mean that it's equally as good or not as bad depending. Doesn't mean either is right.
---
I’d say the title is missleading, sounds like you got it and then lost it. Then people wonder where the disinformation comes from. Rather would say ”expired before said time” or wte.
---
If you were grinding that for six hours, we can pretty much guarantee who the idiot was in this situation.. it’s a fucking outfit. Get over it!!!
---
It's nice to see you agree with me.
---
I think there is a BR game out there that does this. Cant remember it though.
---
Ill try unequipping everything and log off and back in. I regularly change perk cards around cause I have a PvP set and PvE set so I don't think perk cards are the problem but its worth a try!
---
you said junkies will rise I just went from junkie ultracite laser gat to vampiric ultracite laser gat.  i do lose some damage but man. utility and insane tankiness . ease of play. its nuts. far less inventory to manage as well. , i had vampiric laser gat left that for junkie ultracite found a vamp ultracite and it is good to be back I have to say.
---
What exactly does an Enclave roleplay entail?
---
Yes you can, also if you want, not only can you change to a brick solid wall but you can also change what material it's changed out of from the brick wall trick.
---
This is how I made a "lodge" bar haha.
---
I imagine that they carefully scrutinize the numbers on items that go on sale in the Atom Shop and compare the net sales there to those of items that aren't on sale to figure out what people are willing to pay for what items. I've bought some power armour skins when they went on sale that I wouldn't have bought otherwise, for instance, because I felt that they were worth $5 to me but weren't worth $10. 
---
But this said, there's so many people who have voiced so much fury at the idea of cosmetics being made available through the shop. And then the same people voicing fury for non-cosmetics being made available through the shop. It's so exhausting to even try to engage with the discussion. It all just makes me so tired.
---
Well I think I could hook you up with a nice Vamp snowballer with faster reload for 976 if you wanna look into running support.
---
That community, or rather the gaming community at large, really let that triple monetization happen. They just added a per which gives a buff to inventory slots. For the most part all of their users like it and want to see more pets like that
---
Well could be true. The want to get the game out late 2018 not matter what and just cut some content. Just minor things no one needs the first year like NPC's, a beta testing, fleshed out mechanics or social mechanics like a test chat....
---
Elder Scrolls Online, the MMO of Elder Scrolls
---
word? why would you pay that?
---
I'm  level 335 &amp; I've only launched one nuke
---
Darn.... well I hope they at least get it right
---
I'm level 132 and always play solo. Only ever launched a nuke once. There wasnt a lot of people on the sever and we didn't beat the SBQ. Was a bit of a let down and never bothered since because of the amount of stim packs and ammo I needed to use.
---
Ah ok never seen it referred to as eso so I was confused for a min
---
lol I will stick with what I have but thanks lol.
---
Well so much to persistent workshops sometime. But maybe that just costs another 5 bucks a month.
---
That's honestly on the devs. Consoles this gen have always been able to do 60fps but devs decide to go for higher resolution over framerate despite them never actually using the higher resolution to include more detail
---
Because pay to win stuff was promised not to come to 76
---
Truly the epitome of corporate greed, laid the groundwork for F76's atomic shop. The main difference being that atoms can be earned, while crowns cannot. Many of the items you buy in the crown store have a tangible bonus, but not all. However for $50 you can pick up an NPC you can summon anywhere to access the bank
---
Well ESO got a game, Fallout 76 is still lacking. I’m end game meta player in fo76 (which means casual playet in any other game, except for the time played&gt;) with 1,6k hours played.
---
When they figured out ESO was lacking they actually did something about it, vereran rank &gt; champion points and even reworked the engine. (Its in a video where they actually talk about the game from launch to console release and beyond).
---
You can also check the video about Path of Exile from launch and beyond. Where he explain how and when they figured out how to release updates. Source: https://youtu.be/pM_5S55jUzk
---
Player count rise after a patch and the decline after some time, the updates is what keeps the game alive.
---
Now think about wastelanders, being the big 6 month update and its now pushed back. It’s hard not seeing total disaster since which state this game is already in. Only adding the fallout 1st... Come on, you must admit this is laughable and their not making it easy for themselves lol
---
bucketing? yeah they fixed that i believe
---
Its not pay to win.
---
level 72 or something, mostly solo and havent launched a nuke, despite getting a ton of the officers turning up and getting the codes from them often..
---
Level 118 and I hadn't either. This last weekend, somebody posted here that they were looking for players to do just that. So I hopped on and three of us did the run and then Scorched Earth (obviously, others showed up for the latter). A couple of things went wrong due to my never having done it before: I had problems getting the sequence right to get the ID card to work at the start, and I almost died in the irradiated room as I wasn't wearing power armor and I didn't know I needed it. A few things surprised me: There really weren't that many enemies and they didn't seem to be that tough (I guess my anti armor rifle helps with that), I was surprised that there were 3-4 legendaries in there, and it seemed to go much quicker than I expected, like maybe 15 minutes tops. The other two players had done it several times before, so they obviously get full credit for that.
---
Anyways, even though I didn't launch it, we were teamed so I got I Am Become Death off my list. The other two were really nice,  but I doubt they'd run it with me again. I'm pretty quiet in the game so I wasn't fun company.
---
"Bethesda would never lie or mislead consumers" Your are joking, right? Right?
---
I got fallout 1st so people will attack me and I can clap their cheeks.
---
I too would like to know more.
---
I actually deleted 76 from my XBOX this weekend until it is released.  Finished Outer Worlds and starting with Freed Fall.  Hopefully when I am done Wastelander will be around the corner.
---
I am still hopeful about it and I hope BGS's decision to bake it a little longer pays off.
---
Well over 200 and tried a solo run once. PC disconnected when I pressed the final launch button.  ☢️ 🚀
---
Haven't bothered to try again as disconnects still happen too often. I avoid everything in-game that lacks fault tolerance.
---
Been in plenty nuke zones and killed the SBQ several times but never personally launched a nuke.  I've only seen nuke zones by the SBQ fissure, Whitesprings and one random time Flatwoods.  If I launch a nuke I plan to do it in a place where it's rarely seen.  Will probably be butts for flux farming but I'd like to see other nuke zones for some variety.
---
You cannot make the argument "but it's a good game" when talking about cash shops, especially when ESO's is cash only. Doesn't matter how good the game is when you can toss down $50 for an NPC you can summon anywhere to sell stuff to or another $50 for bank access
---
Why don’t you just heat up the party with a flamethrower? 🔥
---
No, I don't like that idea.
---
Uh, in case you aren't aware, Halloween ended 12 days ago. They should've ended at midnight on Halloween imo. Otherwise it feels strange
---
It's a terrible idea. I'm hackers could work around any barriers to improve the pickpocket APM so you're basically drained of all your items that are marked as items that can be stolen within seconds.
---
nope. griefers would use it as a loophole to torture people with. 
---
slap damage was supposed to let pvp be an optional thing it was exploited. 
---
people still exploit the triggered aoes on passive people. 
---
no - toxic players would abuse it to much.
---
You really think they're adding Wastelanders today considering we're in 2019 still? Seems wierd considering they've literally just announced it'll be the first quarter of 2020.
---
Todays update will likely affect nothing more than the Atom Shop and refresh the deals going on there.
---
I've played solo most days since the Beta. The wasteland feels like home.
---
I didnt say its good but that they actually got a game.
---
Only reason i am paying the sub fee is for the scrap box.
---
OK so do the exact same games (eg destiny, Anthem, outer worlds) run at over 100 fps on my pc but run like crap on my xbox? What you said makes literally zero sense
---
No it's becuase consoles are aimed at people who don't have that much disposable income and thus are cheap and accessible. So the hardware will never be on par with a pc
---
ESO was also cosmetic only at first, however everyone should have realized immediately this was going to change when they put the Imperial Race behind an upgraded version of the game and charged you $20 for the privilege
---
That sounds about right, by the time the Wild Appalachia content began rolling out, that was probably mostly done already, which I guess is also why almost all of it was released on time. Even Vault 94 was found in the game in a half finished state already in last November. And the battle royale mode was made largely by the Dallas studio. So, in theory (assuming BGS Austin does put major effort into any development) Wastlanders could have been the main focus since around the spring, with a pre-production stage until then from December.
---
Yup. Not done any end game content aside from SBQ. No nuke, no Arktos, no Harper's Ferry dungeon thing people have forgotten about, the ISS or any of the vault raids.
---
What is the point of a T-51b costume?
---
Yeah, I'd love to run Fort Defiance nuked someday. That's where I may aim my first one.
---
Oh look, [practically the same response I got](https://i.imgur.com/OUBczHy.png) when my C.A.M.P. shit got stuck inside of a bridge (and is still there).
---
They shouldn't have a playerbase at all to even have a game after asking for prices like that  tbh
---
Yea can't it check once every 20 or 30 minutes?
---
But fallout do? lol They keep coming short and now they need more money?
---
It's because people realized, very early on, that there was so much profit to be had in hating FO76. Whether that be in ad revenue on YouTube videos or articles, or just upvotes and likes on Reddit, Facebook and Twitter. You *get* something out of being publicly angry about this game, even and especially if you've never played it. It benefits you to be steaming mad about every little thing. So people devote their time to being angry about it. 
---
A hundred games could do a hundred times worse than anything FO76 is regularly lambasted for, but if there's no reward for being angry about it, people won't care. There would need to be a community of ESO-haters willing to support and reward them for it and that community doesn't exist the way that the community of FO76-haters does. 
---
Nothing about it is proportionate. Nothing about it makes sense outside of a discussion of "what people get out of this performative rage."
---
Lol what? Never said it was coming out today?
---
My scrapbox is called Grafton.
---
Yes
---
Just tested and crouching keeps it from happening which is great, I wasn’t looking forward to having to switch weapons constantly. Thanks again!
---
Have 3 characters over 100 and until recently never launched a nuke. Had someone walk me thru once and now will launch them solo. Only done a few times but nice for farming flux. If on a private server can farm for 2 hours without other people one shorting everything
---
Do you seriously think the only update this game has had was F1st? For a while during Wild Appalachia the game got a new content patch every day for about a month. And sure it was short content and not all of it repeatable but they did add content
---
&gt;Fallout 76 patch 15 suggestions
---
Patch 15 arrives in 3 hours.
---
Actually, do you think it's possible to nuke Deathclaw Island?  Wonder if it'll spawn Glowing Deathclaw hordes like Whitesprings spawns Bloated Glowing Ones.
---
Come up with something original for once.
---
Because 99% of people don't see having 5 extra inventory slots as p2w. Anyone who plays the game is concerned of the slippery slope that might come after but not to the extreme op is at.
---
Good for you, want some mutfruit?
---
That's true, nobody kicked Anthem like they do F76. "Oh wow guess this didn't pan out." But then many of the people who shit on F76 at release would say "now that anthem's out I won't have to deal with this shit game. But they said that about every game, didn't they? Anthem, then Borderlands, then Outerworlds... But yet which news do they check up on? They already played and tossed away the other ones after the honeymoon phase
---
They run like crap because they chose to put the game at a resolution that the consoles have a hard time running at. Also i have a day one xbox and destiny 1 and 2 run just fine and the outer worlds runs great as well so not sure what's going on there. Anthem is just anthem though.
---
And what i said does make sense because higher resolutions takes more power to run at that consoles don't have the power for. Forza has amazing graphics and runs at 60 so it's not the console it's having the game on unnecessary resolutions and lack of optimization from the devs.
---
I wish challenges tracked how many nukes I’ve launched... its hundreds for sure.
---
Patch 1-15 only come out with new content in roadmap... Not every tuesday those are minor fixes to game and updates to the shop. Its not considered a legit patch...would suck if im wrong but i think not.
---
&gt;You cannot make the argument "but it's a good game" when talking about cash shops
---
Of course you can. Cash shops in a good game area justifiable. Cash shops in a bad game are not.
---
People have made multiple arguments and all you keep saying is "you can't make that argument if...", so I'm not really sure what you're trying to accomplish here other than trying to shoot down anything anyone says unless it fits your narrative.
---
It was supposed to end at reset today... maybe they’ll address it in the maintenance this morning.
---
You can't be this dense? Are you actually saying that devs make the choice to limit the graphical fidelity of thier games? And its not entirely due to the limitations of console hardware?
---
Sorry mate but I can't argue with ignorance
---
All changes to the game are considered a patch, unless it is a fix to something which is considered a hotfix. We get 1 patch per month (or have received this for atleast 5 months) and today is the day we'd usually receive one.
---
Fuck this game its too broken to play
---
I still experience the bug where my hits with shotguns are just cancelled by the server and I only do a small portion of the damage I should.
---
Oh I read, but just because enough people are ignorant that the term is molding into that direction in my opinion doesn't make it okay. 
---
I speak English, not American.
---
Dunno what it's called. You'd walk up to a door or wall wearing power armor, exit it, then spam what ever button to enter it while pressing forward and one of the strafe keys. Would make your character enter the power armor slightly off to one side or even in front of it, clipping you through the wall!
---
You are not bright, are you?  
---
Letting companies that straight-up lie to your face have your money for their shit games, paying extra for some extra hats and fallout fuck you 1st memberships and then wonder how come they are starting to do that more often? What is so hard in it to understand it is YOU who are PAYING them so they won't be actually working on a decent game quality instead?
---
If your on Pc I'd be happy to give you something cool, my username is Bobbabas!
---
No, I was talking about right now. As I said I got 1600 hours in the game. Every patch note I’ve been one of the people who had to figure out the unintentional &amp; untold changes. 
---
Yes, Wild Appalachia was the most positive and probably best attempt to save this game. I could be more specific and put more time into my answers to you, but I see no point. Since you’ll just wave it away in a oneliner. You want to be a religious fanatic about this game, fine, thats your life.
---
All the raids can be done solo, and pretty easily on novice.  I’m not good enough to do solo expert on any of them, but standard isn’t too bad.  If I could memorize all the reactor shutdown tasks, last weeks version would be really easy on standard.  That’s the only part where I tend to run out of time.
---
Don't see how it's justifiable to put out $50 NPCs that give you access to a bank or merchant, $100 housing, or locking races like Imperials behind a $20 paywall. To have loot crates on top of that? Despicable that you can't even earn the currency in game like you can with atoms
---
Ill check the main lobby settings and check out the news today if it says patch 15vor just hot fixes...I think its just hot fixes bro like usually.
---
No one needs unlimited stash space. Defeat your hoarder self and level up your inventory management boss.
---
Possibly relevant old [speculation thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cwmypx/what_wastelanders_will_be/). Not sure how much of it is to be believed, but at least it predicted the delay right so far.
---
Why does this not work for me?
---
Wipe the golf club, main menu, play private server. They're all still dead. What's up with that?
---
Luck does not affect Super Duper
---
865 hours in the game, never nuked anything.  
---
Always using nuke in NW.
---
Good luck.  My armor mule ended up with an empty stash not long ago.  Submitted a ticket.  "We are very sorry, but we don't have the tools to unclog the toilet we've designed from the ground up."
---
Ah yeah you're right, we haven't had a real content update for a while if you don't count seasonal events
---
Drop at least one a night but my camps next to alpha so tend to see a lot of low levels if I think there down there for to long I go down and try to help had to message some people the code or drop a card or two but it’s nice helping someone that you can tell is brand new cause having that feeling of dropping a nuke is the best for me personally
---
Warm regards, indeed.
---
how about the reward being able to farm with machines
---
Yup. I play because I like Bethesda games. They scratch a very specific itch that isn’t provided by other open world games. That being said one day someone else will provide that same experience and do it better. That day will be a dark day for Bethesda. They burned all their good will and don’t seem interested in treating their community with a certain level of respect. I never had a problem with the concept of monetisation, never had a problem with the initial lack of content, never had a problem with the initial bugs but since 76’s inception Bethesda seem interested in ruining the very flimsy but decent ground work for what originally could be an interesting game. I’m a day one no mans sky player, I find it cute when people lecture me on this sub about 76 and it’s future. I’m okay with supporting something that starts terrible but has enough interesting ideas to potentially flourish into something beautiful. Bethesda don’t seem
---
Interested so far in salvaging those original concepts that the devs obviously worked hard on. All their recent actions seem to show that they’ve kind of given up. I hope wastelanders proves me wrong. But either way that update will be the final straw if it’s bad. 
---
Everything that makes me most angry about 76 isn’t really 76 itself. It’s Bethesdas cloak and dagger movements amongst a community that up until now gave them a lot of slack simply because they were the only ones making these types of games and up until 76 that respect felt earned.
---
kekw
---
I am ok with the free to play portions of the gaming community getting pissed off and quitting. 
---
games used to be good. 
---
communitys used to be tight. 
---
computers were expensive dialup was expensive. 
---
it was a community of nerds who brought tabletob dnd to the pc. 
---
UO came out and was good WoW came out and was good and a couple of the other grandfathers. they were all subscription based. All were good. subscription base gave them steady income they could show to their investors and plan around. 
---
Then guild wars came out with a really good free to play
---
then other games emulated it. 
---
instead of a community of people with no skin in the game we started get floods of empty headed spaz bots 
---
we started getting games catered to those very same empty headed natter bots. 
---
WHY why would you try to please the customer least likely to stick it out with you for the long haul. 
---
why would any company intentionally go after people who have the least to pay. 
---
I have watched games decline in quality and content since 1996. crap even UO. which was 2d even had more content than almost all of the games of todays market place combined. 
---
I have watched the quality of my fellow players around me decline steadily as well. we treated each other like people in the early days. young teens to 30 year old age group currently are just one of the shittiest demographic of asshat I have ever ran across. 
---
and look at the number one game of all pc gaming right now. Fortnite I have watched this gaming market get more and more mainstream and less thought provoking and meaningful every single year. Fortnite is the big deal. a meaningless fight for... oh wait why are they fighting? whats the story? uuuh whats the strategy? 
---
If players are shouting about free to play they're probably broke, if they're broke they're probably dumb, I know this because I grew up poor. all my dumb friends are still poor. 
---
nothing is free. ever. even when it says free on the box there's always a cost even if its just being forced to watch ads for advertisers. 
---
In summary I am ok with the sub. I hope all the free to play whiners get really upset and leave, because end of the day if you aren't willing to spend money on a product you aren't a customer any company needs.
---
Launched a nuke at level 40
---
I don't think it's exists in F76 - as far as I know (correct me if I'm wrong) there is only .44, .45 and .38 receivers for Pipe revolver.
---
Where did get stat boosting pets from? Pets on ESO are only cosmetic.
---
The only thing that you could say is pay to win is the xp boost scrolls that last 1 hour and the health and poison potions. But the potions are crap so your better off making your own then buying them for real money.
---
If anything I see Fallout 76 the same as ESO as in it needs time before it's good. When ESO started out it was horrible but now it's one of the best mmo I've played.
---
Back when I played, my motivation for nukes was always to scout out camp locations and drop the nukes on a group of camps. You just need to find your motivation.
---
fallout: Putting the "cap" in capitalism since 2102!
---
And wastelanders was supposed to be bigger then Wild Appalachia, even the update the ”negative” people was waiting for.
---
Exactly
---
I no longer play NW, it's a complete mess, and until they get it fixed, I will not participate.
---
The last NW match I played resulted in being killed within 3 seconds of spawning in by 2 players in Power Armor with Gatling guns. This is due to regional server issues, not anyone cheating, but until Bethesda finds a way to even the field and prevent this from happening, I'm out when it comes to NW.
---
2 Characters, 170+ 70+ neither have launched a nuke.
---
Came close last week as in need of  Violet flux, but then someone dropped one on Prime, giving me 100 Violet 70+ Crimson
---
Yep this is correct.
---
I like it as is for plan leaerning,
---
That's because it started early at the time of dailies' reset which is 1 am in europe(around 8 pm US). Hence it also finished at that time. 
---
No cospiracy or bug or anything.
---
2 normal armors*
---
only ridiculous amount is for the PA, normal can build 6 pieces over 5 days
---
Not a NW player too, hated the grind to get the pumpkin armor, didn't even try to attempt to get the skeleton costume lol 
---
I was pretty done with the 7k for that
---
&gt;How does a AAA studio keep getting away withbarefaced lies every other week
---
you ask this in a subreddit filled with people who are still playing this trainwreck of a buggy game and even buying up the Fallout 1st subscription 
---
you've got no one to blame but yourselves for buying this shit on a yearly basis despite bethesda shit reputation amongst gaming community
---
Sounds useful :)
---
Harpers (Just touching the River, mostly over town/ land) and Great Max are good flux locations.
---
I've been launching a few lately to test out my current build on the Scorchbeast Queen (which so far has proven to feel very OP as it melts her health away). Prior to that, however, I only launched nukes alongside my girlfriend so that we could farm flux.  
---
On a side note, the nuke silos are great for making progress on the "Destroy Robots with \[x\]" challenges.
---
&gt;Its an industry wide problem
---
yes, and how does industry get away with it every year? by having you guys still play their games after all the shit they do (and dont)
---
as long as suckers are willing to pay them money, nothing is going to change. welcome to the new normal. sponsored by fallout players.
---
Sixteen Tons is probably my favorite but the four Ink Spots songs are next in line. Hate that "Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall" didn't make it in.
---
You'd still learn plans. Just makes it so your not getting rubber for defending a Nuclear plant.
---
level 250 here.  and no.
---
Weird, are you starting in private? Log off, back onto private, they should respawn. I've done it several times over the weekend.
---
yeah thats the bucketting bug :)
---
it goes back quite a bit where you would use a literal bucket, press it as close to the wall as possible while trying to strafe into it, ending up passing through thin doors and walls
---
Level 226 and still to launch a nuke. 
---
Dont really know why I havnt yet. Just never got round to it I guess. My husband is level 217 and also hasn't launched one. We were going to a while back but never did.
---
Really must get this done!
---
I hope NPCs have more life than outerworlds. I got downvoted to hell for mentioning that on their sub lol.
---
You can trade gold you’ve earned with a player who has crowns to waste and you didn’t spend a dollar so there is that, I just wanted to put that info out there for anyone going through the thread who might not know there is an option to circumvent those prices
---
bethesda fans are just sad lmao
---
why would bethesda try to improve their games when their players keep playing them (and financing them) despite all the shit they've given to their playerbase (which keeps asking for more)
---
cause of weakling players like you is why whole AAA industry has gone to shit - you're just enabling them to do whatever cause they keep getting your money despite shit product quality
---
The mod team doesn't work for Bethesda. We're just Fallout enthusiasts who organize the Reddit community.
---
Exactly that. They're all still dead as if I never logged out.
---
Do you run the cottages too? Or have any others on the server? Or maybe wait for the server to reset?
---
im a bit late to this party, but here's info i can provide. (i also linked a really nice guide near the bottom)
---
rewards:
---
- rewards are off a 20 hour cooldown, 1 reward per cooldown per mission difficulty.
---
- vault steel is earned to craft armor pieces, you get 2 for novice, 4 for standard, and 6 on expert
---
- bulk ammo scrap is used to craft mostly ammo, it has a crapload of items so dont break it down until its crafting time.
---
- standard rewards a jumpsuit, and expert rewards a mask.  the mask counts as a gasmask but has -2per like FSA masks
---
- armor plans drop from standard and expert clears, there are 5 solar plans, 5 thorn plans, and 6 PA plans. as you learn a full set of plans the drop rate goes down by 33% for each set learned.
---
- vault steel, plans, armor pieces, the jumpsuit, and mask are all untradeable
---

Vendor Phoenix has the plans in Watoga.
---
L151, been in plenty of nuke zones, multiple SBQ battles, have at least a dozen cards, plus 10 or so repaired mainframe cards, but have not yet launched.
---
Been trying to lose enough weight to FT back to wher eever I select as the strike point, but not quite there yet....of course, I suppose I could launch so the sile exit is inside the blast zone.....  hmmm....
---
[yes](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more)
---
The franchise was great, my genuine favourite. I've lost all faith now after fallout 1st and the announcement that they're doubling down on it in the future. I'm not spending 100s on a game that's not even half finished and is basically monetising mod use in the future without paying mod makers a penny. Idk what happened to Bethesda but wow.
---
Tge beam focuser is definitely not more effective than the Splitter in any way, shape, or form.
---
They just added a boar pet that gives you +5 inventory space. But I definitely agree the game needs time. I'm just saying this cash shop is not equal to ESO's
---
I've launched it once just to do the quests, and twice more helping friends do them. They go off so often it's never really neccessary to launch unless you want to do something specific with them.
---
Hm... I don't exactly have anything to trade and the Discord isn't working out for me. I think another one of my problems is my age. I'm young and the demographic for this game seems to be older males (18+ usually).
---
I'm going to keep trying, of course, and I've gotten a few messages, so I hope that all works out for me next time I'm on
---
Never have. Level 93.
---
I was doing it solo, did the cottages, all the way round and back to the club. Log off, back on. They all respawned. Did this several times!
---
Clearly we have vastly different experiences. The most people I've run into in one server is maybe 5 and none of them work talk. Just yesterday I was in someone's CAMP at the vendor and there were three other people and none of them said anything back. It was really awkward.
---
I think the biggest reason is that ESO has drawn a fan base of more traditional, fantasy MMO players. Those games have been stuffed with this kind of crap for years, so ESO doing it isn’t out of the ordinary. While people may not like it, it’s not strange to them, so they don’t complain. 
---
76 on the other hand, has drawn a base of players who have favored traditional single player games. Many 76 players aren’t accustomed to this sort of monetization. On top of that, the repeated promises at launch that the MT’s would be cosmetic only just adds fuel to the fire. 
---
The other factor is timing. Gaming consumers are starting to wise up to how manipulative many of these monetization schemes are, and are pushing back—and rightfully so! Any game that introduces new non-cosmetic MT’s is seeing this right now. The fact that 76 has experienced so many PR “slip-ups” makes it an even bigger, and easier target.
---
On Bethesda’s website all event scheduling was posted with ET next to start and end times. EASTERN TIME. Not UTC. You’re wrong. For them to post and schedule everything around ET but then make this one specific part not on the same time zone makes no fucking sense. Go find somewhere where they say it was suppose to end AT THE TIME IT DID. Europe is under GMT so don’t come back to me with some Europe time means ET bullshit.
---
Level 82 and I've never launched one. I am planning to, but I'm quite sure where to go / what to do (quest markers are broken for some reason). And all those robots don't make it to sit and explore around without burning through your stimpaks. :(
---
You have no idea how bad the timezone stuff bites over in Europe.  
---
I get the kids off to school, get home, make a brew, get the table cleared, load the dishwasher, sit down at the keyboard and get about 10 minutes of play time before the fucking maintenance starts!   
---
Then maintenance finishes and I get all excited and then realise I have to go and collect one from nursey/daycare.
---
It for sure is an older crowd, me included :) there is a discord group called ClubFallout that is very active and has members from all platforms 
---

You can find a link on this twitter profile :)
---
As someone whos 26 and has debt I can actually relate to this song...
---
I've been here since day 1 of the beta &amp; I have yet to launch a single nuke.
---
Assuming the coming legendary player system works as an extension of what we already have, allowing you to allocate an extra special point every 50 levels you could do it that way but the issue being you’d have to be level 450 (at least for me I would) or hope to god that perk loadouts allows you to allocate special points separately from your first and third perk builds in which case you could swap at your leisure assuming loadouts could be favourited like a gun
---
We aren't in some lousy Skyrim!
---
Grab the plasma guns!
---
Every time I hear "and I'm so" , I add, FUCKIN'! "sorry my friends".
---
Okay that's the difference. I think either the time spent at the cottages OR the amount of enemies you kill in that time, is satisfying the criteria to respawn them.
---
Because I'm just logging inside the club, that's why I'm not seeing it.
---
Thanks!
---
It does not, unfortunately. Riflegaming did a video on it, and it wasn't worth it. However, some off the beaten path places can be rewarding. Palace of the Winding Path, Monongha, Capitol Building, etc.
---
Or sentinels assassins.
---
We found out..he kicked the bucket and old man Moe's is dead !
---
Every time something happens, theres always several people saying that.
---
It's been a year of blunders. I think those that would have quit, have quit already.
---
My robot solos vault 94.
---
So you are claiming now they are lying? You realize these are the same people Bethesda flew down to Austin to test NW right? Lol
---
This is actually a nice answer. I think you're right about all of it. It's only just now that gamers are "waking up" but not everyone has woken up
---
I didn't know about the boar but I do see your point with it being pay to win in that regard. But if you have a maxed bank you have 240 slots then add in the guild bank of 500 slots, you have 740 storage and that's not including the 200 you can hold on your person. Plus it all enable in game so an extra 5 slots is kinda crap.
---
There is also the craft bag that hold all your crafting materials that's kinda like that scrap box that Fallout 76 added. But still not worth £100 a year lol.
---
Check Path of Exile 45$ for a outfit, it works because its a good game that some want to support. Its even a free game with 100% free updates, which is a kick in the balls to ANY subscription game.
---
I'm Lvl 167 and I also have never launched a nuke .
---
Console wars? Lol what is it, 2010?
---
Well.... when you get near them (before they die) you can see their health and you can pretty much be assured that if someone is running around with a Faschnacht mask, no power armor,  and a deathclaw/mole minor  hand... it's a bloodied build.
---
F76 is totally different because your data is handled on servers rather than locally. Most of the mods available are texture replacers and QoL improvements like text chat, perk card loadout, and better inventory. None of the mods modify gane mechanics for obvious reasons, so there really is no risk in trying them out. If people ran into serious problems while using F76 mods like you did with F4, people would have already been talking about it.
---
I really recommend using mods because some of them will make you question how you've managed to play the game without them.
---
Noticed the armor thing too.
---
No he is right.Its a choice where you want to make the cuts. Granted this is a mater of opinion on what is better. So they do have to make cuts but he is saying the devs don’t optimize the best. So going with a military analogy(because I watched way to much military tv yesterday) It’s like a battleship. They sacrifice speed for heavy weapons and armor. But for some games they are just running recon and don’t need heavy guns. 
---
On a side note I think the two most hated words in a devs language are documentation and optimization.
---
Hi Ok boomer, I'm dad.
---
Fair, then I don't know how people are able to shoot in the sky and get a kill or fly around
---
I didn't get it, but I also wasn't interested in most of the NW rewards.
---
Not "Everybody" who didn't get it, missed out.
---
I'd be cool with a slider for that, but generally making nights darker - nope.  It's hard as hell to see in some places as it is.
---
I do believe he kicked the bucket
---
I was trying to get my work done so I could play this game. This whole time I was doing it backwards!
---
That would require me to reinstall the game. I uninstalled after they released fo1st.
---
Furry Walls...
---
They'll probably make them doable solo, but right now they may be figuring out how to make players pay for it lol.
---
And putting in twice the effort is seems....
---
There are certain songs that would have given the feel of the commonwealth had they been included I think that would be one of them. I think they intentionally placed songs that would match the feel of the Appalachian mountains
---
It is absolutely home. Every time I sign in....Welcome home
---
Could maybe be that yeah! Happy hunting!
---
I rarely go into any situation where I am carrying a lot of junk around with me.  Especially places or situations like Encryptid or SBQ where you can die.
---
If you’re the developer what little extra would you give to those who are willing to pay you extra every month?
---
You ruined it with your god-awful pay-to-win armor
---
Only time I've made friends when I heard two people talking and building their camp together and I hopped in to wave and greet them lol
---
We didn't establish a point of contact outside the game and then I stopped playing about a week later, and now that I'm back I've yet to see them online 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
Although, I do love just wandering into people's camps and waving and heart emoting their cool builds and then disappearing back to the wasteland, it has some fun cryptid energy that I really enjoy lol
---
I'm on PC as well, I think only around lvl 30? Feel free to join me if you want to play together, username: linnnnda
---
Your mom must be proud.
---
I don’t really have anything of worth and I don’t have 4K caps. I think I’ll just close this thread and look elsewhere. Thanks for your time.
---
That was a mistake
---
Mad cuz bad I bet
---
I mean i hate bethesda at this point but he is right, always finish something at least a day before deadline lads!
---
But they didn’t say anything about pay to win stuff not coming
---
It was pretty cool. Just finished farming it. It wasn’t that scary but seeing the Dunwich heads and giant tentacle man was pretty cool O_O
---
I'm always short of the hardened mass...
---
Surprised they didn't extend event since what else we got till March?
---
Its Nuclear Superman!
---
Okay! I'll add you next time I'm on! I have a list of people to add now!! Thanks, Reddit!!!
---
lvl 215 now I think??? but I've launched personally 2ce. carried folks more than 20 times. I have a vamp buzzblade. it will carry you. or something vamp with really high speed. power armor. done. I also have a vamp Tesla and it's bomb. when you're against waves, I like something that heals me.
---
I have a feeling Bethesda is now just making fun of their fans.
---
Did it once at level 50, couldn't kill the scorchbeast queen
---
Oh boy i love spend $80 on a game and being expected to pay more money for a shitty premium.
---
Fallout 76 is a game filled with rpg players. nw is not difficult calm down 😂
---
"Dev team have noticed their mistake and won't throw it into paper shredders instead into a fire to help keep office warm, Fallout 76 always thinking green"
---
It is for the 50 people who couldn’t finish the challenges in a week lol
---
You're suppressing extra build options for 1 game design flaw
---
You are right. Server downtime is when they remove the files associated to the theme event. It would be really difficult if at all possible to remove models, scripting, etc. during live game play without server restarts.   
---
This is for sure a bug and I would fight them for the costume. Tell them to just give it to you. They are already on a shit creek streak. Fuck Bethesda.
---
The real problem is that so many players have already left, so when the ban wave comes, the only people that stayed are the super diehard fans, the NW players, the hackers/duper, and when the dupers, and hackers go, the playerbase will take a fairly big hit. FO76 may not survive if no one will back it, when the player numbers get cut in half.
---
People are mad that the challenge ended before it’s announced schedule you tool. This is not about skill it’s about fallout 76’s unprofessional inconsistency.
---
some overlooked loot locations I like and loot regularly
---
* Toxic Larry's Meat n Go: bobbleheads, meat, recipes, magazines
---
* Charleston capitol building: lots of enemies, chance for legendaries
---
* Garrahan estate
---
* Medical building in Charleston

back in the 90s open mic chat was something all of us wanted but the tech wasn't capable of delivering it. now we have it and people don't want to use it.the irony kills me.  I straight up tell people their emoji doesnt mean much go get a mic I don't mind helping a fellow waste lander out but I am not going to play 20 questions to figure out what some dude is trying to emote to me.
---
It was still about a week, if you wanted it you would’ve gotten it before then.
---
UwU
---
Rad resist is a bad idea going into fire. You need the rad to stay alive.
---
Exactly!! It's so annoying and the mic option is so easy to use!
---
Much of that *could* be caused by your internet, anything from being on wifi to problems with routers between you and whatever AWS servers you're connecting to.
---
Not saying that *is* the issue, but eliminate those possibilities before you look anywhere else (and no, 'my wifi is strong' and 'I don't have problems with any other games' are not valid excuses for proper troubleshooting).
---
That said...76 is a buggy mess and is more likely to be the problem than the things I mentioned, though none of that is universal to everyone.  Consoles, especially older ones, seem to bear the brunt of the problems for some reason.
---
That’s nifty!
---
Some of those bugs were previously fixed. It's almost nostalgic. 
---
I am hoping that today's patch cleans this up. Yes, send bug reports with videos, screen shots on the Official support forum. I do each individually which makes loads of tickets. :D
---
Gary
---
I didn't launch my first nuke until I was level 200 and had about 435 hours played. and that was last week.
---
No you and him are completely wrong and are literally talking out of your arse
---
&lt;Rad Worms Intensifies&gt;
---
I'm with you. I'm still lvv 78 and can't decide what should i do there, since SBQ had 70% damage resistance.
---
I just look at what I enjoy. If I enjoy something I allow myself to explore that. Yes it sucks the gaming industry is trying to milk us specifically my favorite developer but at the end of the day I’m going to allow myself to enjoy what I enjoy. I will not spend my hard earned free time in negativity. This is about me and no one else.
---
Why ? They werent designed accidentaly.
---
What I do now, as a melee/shotgun guy.  Quick respec and a .50 works  :-)

Would also like to know

Some girls have to kiss a man to hold him, but me?

I have to hold em to kiss em!
---
Did ESO launch as a full priced game with the micro-transactions in place, or did they add all that on later after people were already playing?  I know if was a long time ago at this point, but I'm not at all familiar with the franchise.
---
Not making a comparison exactly, ESO is an MMO and 76 really isn't, but since they're both from the same outfit I'm curious if they're both taking the same path or if 76 is a different approach altogether.
---
So clever lol.
---
I'd like to see your perk cards/build please my kind Sir !
---
Out of roughly 20 support tickets I have submitted I have only received a request for additional info twice, and submitted video evidence on both occasions, both of those tickets were closed after receiving emails stating that they were investigating the issue, all other tickets have received nothing more than a Canned response, and were immediately closed.
---
Bethesda, unfortunately seems to lack the manpower or tools to properly support their customers, on a few very Rare occasions I've heard of them restoring Characters &amp; Inventories, but those were restored from several weeks old saved data, with all recent progress lost.
---
In short, don't hold your breath, you will only get blue in the face.
---
Yeah it was a $60-100 game at release with a mandatory subscription and cash ONLY shop. Eventually they did drop the mandatory sub for a voluntary one with extra perks but the shop is still cash only and it's not f2p except on certain weekends. Basically it's the triple monetization trap
---
If you're still choosing to play this game despite everything that's happened then you can't be upset about this kind of thing anymore.
---
Country Roads, 16 tons, and praise the lord and pass the ammunition.   We hot really lucky with the sound track.
---
Well, to be fair, ESO has a lot less bugs and never crashed, at least in the 2 years I played.
---
The timer for the first item started early, around 8PM EST on the 28th, not the 29th. I'll bet they started the timer early, which would also explain why it stopped at around 8pm on the 11th.
---
I got mine on the cheap during the Halloween event.
---
That is the most anti feminist song in all of existence lol. Basically the message is if you have a man and you want to keep him shut up and please him. Why? Because a good man nowadays is haaaaard to fiiiiiiind
---
Thanks bro!
---
That wouldn't be "fair" to the cheaters that spent an hour to get the costume. Or to the people who legitimately got them, but Bethesda cares less about them. Naturally the best response is to put the costume and paints in the Atom shop for 500 atoms, give everyone 500 atoms, and you can buy them with your 'free' currency if you want.
---
I’m nearly 100 and have never nuked. I’ve tried it solo a few times, but just got frustrated and went back to doing fun stuff.
---
It's definitely not worth the time you used up to play this god awful game
---
Haha nice one bud! Plenty ore too! Think I need to make a trip tonight. Got plenty acid so might as well!
---
Yeah I may not agree with it thematically but damn if the 
---
**H U H U H U H U H** 
---
Isn't funny as shit
---
I want to say 80-90 so far... If only we can see how many nukes we’ve done lol.
---
I remember in Beta how enjoyable it was. Even though it’s a great soundtrack it does get tiresome. But there are a few that never get tiresome. Everyone has their few and the cool thing is it’s a different few across the board
---
Dude I got so much. Thanks for all your help :)))
---
It's not an MMO and Bethesda aren't MMO developers.
---
With the settlement building in Fallout 4 I couldn't agree more. It was very restricted to certain settlements only but I'm guessing since it was the first time they implemented it they didn't wanna go too crazy I dunno. Before 3 I had never played a Fallout type game before it's one reason I got so hooked on it. Fallout 76 is incredibly addicting. I managed to get a few friends to give a shot too. Your on Xbox, as am I, what is your gamer tag I will add you. It's always awesome playing with someone who shares the same passion for the game
---
I am lvl 99 and never do that. Because that is a group mission and I always play alone.
---
Yeah it was like that last night for me when I was ganna grind out my last 2k but I was crushed by the site so I just logged out. So lame
---
It definitely fits fallout as something over the top
---
I have done it once. I mostly solo and when they nerfed explosive, my build became much weaker and I can't even think about the amount of bullets I would need to solo the launch mission.
---
Prob 35k plus, it's legacy. A lot of people are keeping hold of them for trades only. I'd happily buy it for caps! HeHe.
---
No doubt.  I really get tired of Ol Man Mose and I didn't know the gun was loaded.  I say get rid of them for Big Iron and Ain't it a kick in the head.
---
k
---
Lol someones raging early morning.
---
Well that's honest at least.  The paywalled amenities is one of the reasons I haven't even considered ESO, but if it was originally part of the deal then I don't really have a big problem with their approach.  Not a fan, but that's not an issue.
---
76 had no monthly fee up front, which is why a *lot* of people take issue with locking pretty nice perks behind a subscription.
---
I've got no issue with the cash shops or a monthly fee (I played WoW for many years, and it has both), but changing directions mid-stream really leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and has cost them a lot of trust with the whole company.
---
Regular Armor provides resistance to specific body parts, which does not include the head.
---
I have only ever done one and it was for the quest. Too many are already going off that by the time i get to the launching part that the place i wanna nuke would already be nuked.
---
Lol.
---
I think they purposely left certain songs out that if played would give the player a feel for another game. They wanted to make sure the songs fit the feel of Appalachia. It’s a shame and purposeful all at the same time
---
If the game isn't supporting itself, then something has to be done if cosmetics aren't cutting it. Also F1st isn't technically atom shop. You may think that this is a dumb loophole but ESO did the same by saying all DLC would be free with ESO+, then reneging that after two years and coming out with chapters, which are dlc that isn't called dlc
---
I've seen it sell for way more lol. I use this and an aaffr handmade. So I'm covered different resistances.
---
It depends. If it's the AAE with +50 DR while aiming then I say they aren't worth much as it's one of the most duped guns in the game.
---
Sixteen tons, it’s my favorite.
---
With their tiny roach hands
---
Harpers ferry dungeon thing?
---
Lol best question of the day by far.
---
cool, but everyone gets a warning about a nuke drop.  too bad there aren't "no warning" nukes! that would be awesome.
---
Think it’s only .38 and .45.  :(
---
There is a lot of truth in that song that doesn’t just apply to being a coal miner
---
Play stupid games and win stupid prizes
---
Ghost riders in the sky
---
The pink and forest are the more rare ones and of course red is the most rare. Yellow, blue, green, and brown are all fairly common
---
You are right, it’s a lot more. Your stash/bank can be upgraded, premium tabs, extra tabs, premium tab bundles, map tab, currency tab, essence tab, unique tabs and so on. Being priced from 7 - 25$ (each). Except to upgrade the free ones cost 2$ (think its 4-5 so 8 - 10$).
---
It’s in the asylum with the rest of them. There is brown, green, blue, pink, yellow, Forrest and red
---
Just launched my first one ever now solo, unfortunately servers go down at 3 but I'll still get some work done on the nuke zone before then.
---
I'm level 303 BTW.
---
True. And a lot of history. The company store was a very real thing, and it drove my Papaw out of mining. 
---
He was a miner in West Virginia. the company store, straight up riots over trying to unionize, and dangerously low standards for health conditions had him leave. He had stories to tell.
---
Must just be RNG. Personally, I have been getting more 3* gear dropped lately
---
I actually lol’d in game thinking about the same thing.
---
Yellow exists. I have one.  I've found all the colors except red
---
Or you can use weightless armor.
---
I’ve been grinding for about two months. Server hopping and still no yellow??? Explain my luck.
---
They still have significantly higher damage, but they were honestly a bit OP'd before. I agree it sucks when your favorite weapon gets nerfed, TSE was a huge one, but it needed to happen.
---
You mean like the 500 pieces they gave for a $200+ dollar canvas bag.  
---
I know it's totally different in scale of reward, but my time is worth more than 500 credits.   
---
If I spend 20 hours on grinding a holiday event and am only reward with $5 in fake monies, I'd be pissed.   
---
I can earn $320 for the same time spent. My choice, sure, but if I am putting my time into a game I would expect the game to correctly reward me for it. either give me the outfit or provide substantial reward for your mistake.
---
you compared them
---
16x the detail.
---
And I haven’t found yellow apparently. I’ve figured I had all colors.
---
Nice one! I keep what I need and sell everything else. A few thousand bullets doesn't last long before someone comes and buys it all!
---
If you going to waste time on a revolt, you should revolt real world problems. I mean... given this is real world, but it's very localized and people in Hong Kong or Chili don't give a Dirty Harry's Dick about Bethesda capabilities.
---
Saying gaining acess to unlimited , uncontested resources is " a mild convenence" is understatement of the year
---
I honestly think the yellow is more rare then the Forrest.  I've found two forrest and only 1 yellow in 6 months.  A friend of mine has had the same luck
---
It’s gotta be because I have seen yellow once since The whole time I’ve been searching
---
The time in Europe is irrelevant. The time announced is the only thing that matters. Who said anything about the earths shape 😂. I asked a simple question. When was the event suppose to end? It was announced to end for US eastern time on the 12th. You keep bringing up random things “time is time” what’s that even mean 😂. Yes time is time.
---
level 155 last night. #nevernuked
---
lure them out to the tennis court and mini nuke, BOOM possum badge
---
I treat ESO and Fallout 76 AS BUSINESS PRODUCTS, REMEMBER, ITS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY NOW GUYS!
---
This is why bethesda will fail and I honestly hope they shut down, have been a fan but they have been nothing but a social media clown and big jokes to the majority,
---
Each game is just a store, first thing that pops up!!!
---
"Buy our 50$ game to spend 200$ in cosmetics that you could lose the moment we shut down this piece of shit game! 😌"
---
I'm having a new one (new to me at least) where when I'm crouched, there's a weird glitch obscuring my visibility. And during that moment, I also have what looks like broken and bloddies limbs sticking out of my body. I only know this because I stripped down naked to see if it was an armor or clothing glitch. AND I'm having a new to me glitch of my guns going into scope mode without touching any buttons and it will glitch back and forth for a bit.
---
These both went away on their own randomly. 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Yea it happens almost everytime in private servers..you just have to ft away..rejoin the server and go back it..all enemies respawn then.
---
Communist detected on American soil. Lethal force engaged.
---
Maybe if you did any amount of research you'd find plenty of examples of games in the early part of this generation that had one version in 920p and another in 1080p and the 1080p version actually looked worse because they couldn't put in as much actual detail.
---
Also i know how game development works both actually making the game and the business side because ive done plenty of research on the business side and i both have tried game development and researched professional game development.
---
lol I don't plan on paying for a full year because I don't know if I'll be playing in a year. Suppose there's a chance I will, but that's like two iced coffees. I see your point though, it's mostly the scrap box that's a big draw for me, that and dance emotes
---
I was under the impression the last patch was Patch 15.  I was incorrect, it was Patch 14.
---
U may be right u may not i know what i was playing it was roughly half the vendors had it but ur also not seein the people who stoped playing becuz of it
---
Still broken, don't work. Only good (great) for crippling enemies.
---
The issue with that narrative that Bethesda banned that guy, is it relies on the omiting vital information. In particular that he was using a Cheat Program that the Anti-cheat system caught and subsequently banned the account in question. Given that said user has later said he was un-banned, which would confirm that it was not intentional action on the part of Bethesda, but rather the anti-cheat system. Of course that guy really should issue a retraction to put an end to the anti-bethedsa circle jerk his post generated.
---
Hahahahaha
---
Sure mate
---
Quick question: do the drop rates for the plans still go down if you get the plans for a full set but didn't learn them?
---
Eso launched with eso+
---
Fallout 1st fixes problems inherent to the game and pay walls it almost a year after launch.
---
They went back on their promises too, mostly switching up the "DLC will always be free" promise to "ESO+ does not cover story chapters, which up until now have been dlc"
---
if you cannot see/understand the huge advantage you can get from a fallout 1st sub - i probably cant say anything to change your mind.   I also really dont care - just thought it was funny to call it " a mild convenience" when clearly that isnt the case.
---
Actually with proper attachments and a less VATS railway, it costs 2 ap per shot. Handmades and assault rifles can get down to like 3 - 5.
---
To the right buyer it’s worth 35k+ personally while it’s a good weapon it loses condition waay too fast for my taste.
---
Its a bird, its a plane..no its (da nananaaaa) HACKERMAAAAAN
---
Possibly fractional radiation damage, so you’re at .25 hp which the pip-boy rounds down?
---
Im actually pretty sure they were the worst in the series
---
Truth on that, I just like to see peoples point of view when they buy it, in the end I want better for everyone on the game because they try to divide the playerbase with these types of purchases
---
Yes, please remove the last thing I enjoy (trying different builds to suit a weapon or armor I find) from the game.
---
this post made me leave this sub
---
Nothing needs nerfed, people just need to learn how to counter properly. You cant run around with a suppressors shotgun screaming nerf everything.
---
Lmaoo I’ve ran away a lot lol
---
That's mean lol
---
all is well on effects tab. class freak does not seem to be working either as negatives are not suppressed
---
i remember dying recently while trying to put the scorched dna in VTU and  the camera went crazy and i got a glimpse of a room like that lmao, now i understand xd
---
Get more fusion cores for you power armor.
---
sims?
---
I tried a couple times when i was at lvl 80. Got slaughtered by endless gutsys.... now at 146 i can't be bothered. I don't even remember or know everything i need to do. Besides, everyone else launches them anyways.
---
300+ hours in the game and I've launched only one Nuke and that was after playing the game for maybe 150 or 200 hours already. Originally I didn't feel the need to do so, while I still had content to do and location to discover and go through. Later, I was afraid that my stealth sniper build (with no good viable legendary) wasn't suitable for large indoor quest. And when I finally tried I was proven right. I could deal with the mobs, clear them from stealth... but it was the mobs respawning behind my back that really pissed me off. The constant running back and re-stealthing was frustrating.
---
When I finished the silo run I didn't feel satisfaction, I felt only relielf. The kind of "oh my god, thankfully that terrible thing is over" relief. The design of silos doesn't go well with my build and playstyle. The same goes for Vault raids. I can spend half an hour to clear a floor of mobs, only to have and objective trigger more mobs and run me over (or jump on me when I'm reading a terminal)... and then have to start all over. Mob respawning in silos and no player respawning in vault raids are there just to add tedium and therefore I opted out...
---
Does the guided meditation place count? Seems pretty chinesey i think
---
Mmm people didn't know what they were getting into when they lied and said "ESO+ will always cover DLC" which it doesn't anymore
---
but then he would already be banned
---
The Water Plant is always swarming with Liberators and you can build really close to it. Not exactly 'themed' but it's definitely been overrun by the commie's
---
Ok I have a lot of those. Do i just select it on my pip boy and equip one to put in it or?
---
Stop locking gameplay features behind paywalls they wont get as much scorn i will never get my freinds to play this game again after the sub fee was hard enough before
---
For power armor, you need to insert a new fusion core.
---
To add a stash box, enter build mode in your camp and scroll over to "Stash Boxes" and build the one you want.
---
To move your camp, find a place you want to have it, open up your pipboy, and hit the button/key for "Move Camp."
---
If you stay crouched, you keep the 250 buff too.  So it’s a big buff too, if you know how to use it.
---
Let's nuke his camp.
---
Thank you!
---
I dont find that mine does. I repair for double too though and have a forceful stock. I also do sbq a lot so I have tons of kits.
---
I’ll add you when I get back on later today
---
No just get in your power armor. It will automatically use the fusion cores. Not fusion cells, but cores.
---
That's a good idea, and the lake has a bunch of spawns...hmmm.
---
If you have more in your inventory, it will automatically recharge when your current one reaches zero.
---
ESO never tried to say it was going to be anything other than an MMO with monetary transactions. ESO didn’t try to cater to or entice the single player audience. If they had been as honest with FO76 as they were with ESO the backlash wouldn’t have been nearly as severe.
---
I agree things shouldn't be nerfed I never got to play with normal TSE weapons.  However, things have been nerfed already and unless Bethesda is willing to share the data on if it is a problem then it appears to be based on this boards discussions.
---
Keep in mind that if you die after the SBQ, the game deletes your flux.  So the very first thing you should do after the SBQ die is run over to the closest Fallout 1st tent and stash your flux.  Then you can proceed to loot and kill stragglers in the nuke zone.
---
Im not sure about that overpriced extra content is beths thing nowadays the reason i stopped buying there games after skyrym
---
me too, ive only found a few colored ones so far...its a serious grind!
---
Nah I wouldn’t do that. The only place where I pay for micro transactions is MK11 and R6S
---
On the one hand, grinding for the rewards did get me about ten levels in NW, with the normal rewards that go with them.  Which I probably wouldn't have done, as I'm not a regular NW player.
---
On the other hand, I was so damn close to that outfit, only to have the rug pulled out from under me.  That was a real feel-bad moment.
---
I'm not advocating for anything you're going on about. I just want blocked players to not use my vending machines. And make that a setting so that those who do can allow it.
---
Looking forward, I'd like to have a private server running mods that is open to the public, but I want the authority to boot people off of it. Bethesda needs to take a look at how games are set up in TF2, where you can choose a server based on the mods it's running.  Development of such mods will require server code to be runnable on a machine the dev has full access to, and I'm not sure Bethesda will ever do that.
---
Bethesda themselves can't get down to give an apology how did you expect their customer service to give one?
---
Your goal would be to blend in so find a spot that is the most American and overact being American (lots of 4th of July stuff).
---
Telepathy
---
That last part helped a lot! I’m level 7 already lol
---
That's what I had doubts about. Is the fire more of constant damage or constant radiation?
---
I have blue, brown, forest, green, pink, red, white, weathered, white dirty. Hats matching HOWEVER I FOUND MY YELLOW HAT. BUT GUESS WHAT DOESNT HAVE A MATCHING OUTFITTT
---
I’m assuming you scrap them as well?
---
Ay, yea that's probably why it was delayed. NEED those subs to get the full value of wastelanders, so only half of it will be available to non subscribers!
---
Everyone wants things for free, unfortunately that is not how life or video games have ever worked.
---
Damn it’s always a level requirement to get good stuff that keeps you alive lol
---
I've launched a good number. Silo runs are fun, queen fights are fun. The only time it sucks is if you are in a laggy server, dealing with mainframes is extremely frustrating in those instances. If your server is good tho, then it's a good time.
---
Especially in a game  heavily balanced around weight
---
Some houses have a red star on them, dunno if its WV thing but its new to series and i'm preeetty fucking sure res star means communism, meaning those lads are commies or at the very least union members? you might find a buildable red star'd house
---
&gt;  I have a very high perception stat paired with a lever action in VATs. I can clear enemies out quick enough that a player unfamiliar, might think it was an aimbot in use. 
---
Well, VATs more or less *is* an aimbot...
---
From experience playing as a bloodied, junkies, full hp aa and more I can say it's all pretty equal. Bloodied chameleon build giving you trouble? Get in a better position, use chems for perception, berry mentats etc. Or get a gamma gun. There is always a way. I was a bloodied commando build for a awhile using a be handmade. I swapped to full hp aa weapons.
---
This is pretty interesting. I'm a bit late to the party here but I've done a few of my own exploratory things in this area. Here is my addition to this:
---
1. There is a lot of ground work lain out here. Both in these 2 particular rooms but in many other areas of the "vault." A lot of interior cells don't have much going on outside of the bounds and usually only show the player what they need to see through windows and such. Here there is a lot of areas to walk around, many catwalks that lead to other areas and just overall a lot more ground to explore, most of which isn't visible by the players within the boundaries. Personally, it seems like the area where people would walk around and study the vault dwellers within.
---
2. The layout of that room with all the "servers" and the desk is different than other areas of it's type. It lends itself really well to being cleaned up, and filled with NPCs. Imagine this becomes a hub for settlers who didn't want vault life to end or something along those lines. I could definitely see this area working as a "quest hall" of sorts for a smaller VTU themed faction.
---
3. There are a ton of assets scattered about out in the void of this cell. Again, to my first point, there isn't normally a lot leftover from creating these interior cells. I've explored as many as I can think of and the only time I've seen any assets floating out in the void was once. This makes me believe either they have started working on it again and are leaving some assets around to design it under our noses.
---
4. I've explored this interior cell before and I really feel like I would have found this sooner. Could be a new installation in preparation for WL or maybe my memory is just fading.
---
Nah good idea but I’m looking to make my character for an RP so having a Chinese located base works well.
---
Don't comment if your just gonna be a dick
---
You say that and yet it prox more often the higher my luck has been in past experiences. Be it coincidence or not, that has been the observation every time so unless proven others I will continue to uphold said belief.
---
That’s the best place I’ve thought of atm but I’m gonna keep looking
---
&gt;This is why I like private servers, friends ~~assholes~~ can~~'t~~ steal my shit!
---
FTFY XD
---
I sure do love spending 20-40 min on loading screens trying to play on a server where I can sell stuff. Absolutely wonderful.
---
Nah the red star thing is a way to scare off snallygasters. I wish it was but the star is official WV lore.
---
The server isn't what's crashing, if it's constantly happening. It's on your end. You can add my vote to the growing list of people saying it's not happening to us (and I'm also on Xbox) and that it's likely your internet or something you're specifically doing to cause it.
---
I've sat on my server for 12 hours straight and only lost connection due to a manual world leave. That's with people joining and leaving it and doing multiple different things.
---
I'll agree with that but I dunno why everyone keeps saying ESO never misrepresented things or straight up lied. They said DLC would ALL be free with ESO+. Then they changed the name of story based dlc to chapters and only include dungeon expansions in plus now
---
Morgantown is also a really good spot for cobalt if you need it too.  The mutfruit by the train yard all goes to cobalt.
---
I really like how they do them in NW. Gives you 15 seconds to respond XD
---
Already on it.
---
Chapters or not is just semantics
---
they do not, but iirc not learning them gives you a chance at duplicates.  my groups didnt do to much testing on it. but it seems to "roll" a set, then checks to see if you need a plan, if you do you get x plan you need, if you did learn it then it just gives nothing in that reward slot
---
I just rechecked their article and it is specifically written the NW prtart of the event will end the 12,but no hour is written. It also says the 1st reward came the 29 while it should still have been the 28 in US(since it was 1 am in europe when it popped, I was playing it).  Do you understand now?  It started EARLY and finished after the days it was supposed to last. For americans it was 28 to 11 ,europe 29 to 12 and new Zealand 30 to 13.   It lasted exactly two weeks.
---
Do you still have something troubling you?
---
It's their go-to reward.  The one thing more portable than the frequency of their debacles
---
I’m looking more for themed or lore based not really enemy spawn locations. Thank you for location though
---
It just works!
---
Hot patch with additional bug fixes, notes should surface soon
---
Ahah, nice joke :P
---
There's no Job system in this game - builds are defined by gear, perks, and playstyle
---
Probably with the shotguns they carry around with em?
---
Ohhhh... Literary !!
---
I swear they shut servers down a lot more frequently, since they introduced first.  It's not even worth taking over workshops anymore. Every time I take one the server shutdown warning comes on 20 minutes later.
---
Maybe they are fixing the infinite armor condition? It probably does not help the sales of repair kits. :) Or it could be some new exploit.
---
Radiation stay the same but the damage increase. If you going for the briefcase you gonna need that rad to heal you. Also simpak are a must as well.
---
lolol
---
Not until they find the "best" way to make money off of it
---
That was my thought. Some exploit is the likely explanation.
---
I understand the frustration but don't have a ton of sympathy. There was plenty of time to get it. I got mine despite:
---
• Being a decidedly mediocre NW player
---
• Having a job/family
---
• Being out of town for two days for work in the past week.
---
The glowing skeleton mask looks awesome combined with the pumpkin combat armor paint btw
---
There's probably something wrong with the Fallout 1st sub or the Atom Shop.
---
Shhhhhh......me and my mountain of ballistic fiber at very reasonable prices dont know what your talking about!!!!
---
bloodied is a glass cannon.  no nerf just buff
---
If you on ps4 I could screenhot ya my nw briefcase built
---
It was 12 AM somewhere but not here :( They probably won't do anything. Best they could do is add it as a free atom shop item
---
It literally says 30% on the card...
---
This post is smug and dismissive of other player's personal situation. You may have learnt this lesson, but it makes you seem smug and petty to brag to people who might not have had the choice to play earlier or the personal situation to spend hours of their loves at a moment's notice for an aesthetic achievement
---
Just let me earn them in the normal game. I need no freebies
---
For real.  I like the high stakes game that bloody provides.  I've got four different character builds, and the bloody sniper is by far my favorite.  Killing SBQ solo with a bloody rifleman while at 19% health or less is an entertaining endeavor.  You can't die or her health will jump straight back to full.  I don't like the raids as much, but I enjoy the fact that dying is instant failure.
---
Explosive bait does not work.
---
Jail bait, however apparently does as they'll swoop on down every time for that sweet, sweet
---
Question, since I had wondered this before. I currently have my CAMP with the barn walls throughout. Minus the broken windows look, I dig it. However, of course it has the interior look of the unfinished wood framing studs. Fine for hanging stuff on the walls bu not super appealing looking. If I were to use my Atoms on wallpaper, are you saying I wouldn't be able to utilize in my build? I guess I had assumed the wallpaper would trigger some sort of drywall under layer for the wall paper to adhere to.
---
All this post has done is remind me I should hate Bethesda even more. Thanks
---
Is that 7 am or 7 pm ?.
---
I think 7 am is 1 pm here in the UK
---
7 pm is 1 in the morning.
---
Let me know please.
---
I will private message my PS4 Username to you anyway.
---
And thanks.
---
wait snallygasters are real
---
SAME. I was one game away!... :(
---
What are you even talking about? I'm not expecting everything for free, I'm aware that's ridiculous. They can charge for bonus cosmetics and for servers, that I understand although I think they're currently too high priced. I just really don't like gamplay changing elements that will effect me in Adventure Mode. 
---
I still have to worry about my scrap limit whilst for 1st members that's no longer an issue. I don't think that's fair considering I already payed them over £60 of my money and have been loyal to stick with this game.
---
They'll probably do nothing about it. 
---
Maaaybe they'll run the challenge again for another week, but think about it.
---
You had 2 weeks to grind it out. If you wanted the outfit, but haven't gotten it yet, it means you gain overseer xp really slow, either by not being very good at the mode or just not having enough time to play and grind it out.
---
Seeing as how challenge progress would be reset if they reinstated the challenge...do you think those people be able to start from scratch and get in another week?
---
I do not think they should just give it to everyone however, but that is totally selfish of me because I DID grind it out and got it, and everyone else getting it for nothing would cheapen it for me. Just being honest about my boss.
---
There's a lot to hate them for but we never learn :(
---
I'm in the 320s, and I think I've only launched one, somewhere around level 250.  I wanted to get the quest off my to do list, more than anything else.
---
Bloodied has its drawbacks its a heavy risk to run around low health especially in pvp, junkies has negative effects to it's stats it's( for full health) looking at the two in comparison it's about even for the two junkies is also starting to become popular people are still trying to figure out the build what they run I personally find it interesting I'm running autostim cavalier and have taken out 2 people recently with handmades bum rushing them can't we leave it where it's at.
---
Magic, I'll be online later tonight, will reply to you then bud!
---
i cant seem to kill anyone, when if they are naked and im wearing full marine armor with a 50 cal
---
i just resigned myself to being a bushmasta, which works! I  do soooooooo much better when i just avoid all fights
---
Best thing they could do is talk about taming creatures imho
---
Big ole dupe going around right now, besides the throwables one. Hopefully it's a 2 for one on that.
---
Yeaph ;)
---
Take the workshop for the plans, then clear the area/move on.  
---
When the defend even pops up, if you are so inclined, find a spot outside the workshop zone to snipe the CG enemies.  If no such spot exists, don't bother with the defend.
---
Obtain your mats while adventuring.
---
My exact experience. I lost my power armour during the patch where all armour pieces were removed from their frames.  I received the response that they cannot restore items and they are sorry I lost items. That’s when I stopped playing.
---
If im remeberiing correctly some of the content gameplay that has been tesased or leaked. Has actually shown that you do need to do at least some of the questline solo, it would seem.  Needing you to be solo without a team to even advance in the quests.
---
I remember seeing some video in one of juiceheads videos, before having to leave the video early. I try to watch some a good majority of his content, but more recently have been unable to stand his constant fence hopping reguarding fo76 in general. I get that he is most likely following analytics and is probably making a killing, but it does make him seem disgenuine and, at least for me, intolerable a significant portion of the time. Ill see if I can find a link for you to see what I'm talking about.
---
Got a yellow one about a week ago just roaming the asylum.
---
There is no need to nerf anything, maybe tone bloodied down a bit, since it's over synergetic with perks. 
---
What needs to be done is removing the ton of useless legendary effects, and adding new, useful ones, that would enable different playstyles.
---
It isn’t the Best Opinion, it’s Spacer’s Opinion
---
lvl 124 and played during beta and havent launched one yet...just started doing the merit badges though.
---
Same way they put on their top hats and hold their canes
---
Wow! That looks like a "blast!"   ...I tend to stand in the doorway to the building, toss a grenade down the stairs, which blows the lower level and the kitchen area upstairs and then they all come running out to my fist bumping action. I usually have to go downstairs to trigger the wendigo, but that's ok. Good for a final sweep. 
---
PS: Then I blow all the cars/vans outside and walk away...slowwwwly, as if I am a bad  ass in an action movie.
---

---
I think it sends the wrong message to the kids.
---
They still trigger Enforcer, and work well for support builds
---
Fair point unfortunatly 😅
---
You should check out YouTube rifle gaming. For all your "I wonder what would happen if I drop a nuke on....." questions. You think it he has probably done it
---
i get it on certain servers with any weapon that can deal a large amount of damage in one shot
---
certain crappy servers/network packet loss are the problem, not the weapons or perks
---
if i switch servers to a  better/faster one the problem is gone!
---
Pretty much what everyone thought
---
Was around 2000 xp away and it just disappeared last night, they did say the 12th... I’m positive I got the skin by how much I played and placed within the top 5 last night. 
---
I work a full time job, prepping for school, and run a side audio business. Time is precious and I feel I wasted it now if I don’t get this award.
---
They said first updates and bug fixes but the human interaction figure being added will not happen today set back to feb. 2020
---
I don’t even know how to launch a nuke, and I’m level 116
---
Classic
---
and to people downvoting: explain WHY- are you upset at bethesda, people complaining, or what?
---
I've met three this past week and none for months before that. So maybe
---
I came across about 300 mines laying on the ground on PS4
---
I have a bloodied explosive combat shotgun, and it WRECKs things right now....I can’t imagine what the experience would have been like pre nerf. 
---
I haven’t seen the health regen issue with this weapon, but have experienced it in the past on different ones.
---
That was a bug I was happy to keep.
---
Hopefully this thread will be of benefit to you also.
---
Nothing worse than having to walk around an SBQ Fight like a Baby with a full nappy.
---
:)
---
I saw that a couple of times over the weekend.  It always seemed to be the same few accounts, too.
---
Ironically, I got some of my best placements off them, as they usually killed all of the actually good players before they got around to killing me.
---
Nah, take their caps.  You might as well get something useful from their presence in the gameworld.    
---
On the other hand, what I'd like is the ability to set a level cap for items I try to sell cheaply for low level characters. *You're higher than level 20?  You can't buy this item.*
---
That and would be interesting to know how mole rats use elevators.
---
Ahhhh I remember those days. The days of hesitating to launch my first nuke. Burning through loads of ammo and stimpaks. Good times. 
---
Now I launch 3 one after another solo. Lol
---
Considering I'm weapon vendor who already spends tons of scrap making guns, mods and repairing. That Scrapbox would help me immensely. My Stash space is already mostly taken up by the 3 star legendaires in my vendor machines. I would love to not just ever worry about scrap taking up storage, but no I have to go though a paywall thanks to greed and certain fans that want to defend this.
---
I  like both the armors tbh.
---
I just prefer the Ultracite for SBQ fight.
---
Also like the Paint Job on it i bought from the ATOM Shop.
---
Huh sometimes I just randomly lose health when running bloodied.  Is this the reason for it?
---
Nobody ever wondered what that flushing sound was all about after submitting a ticket?
---
I have in both pve and pvp. it's nothing special imho. But my dropping a nuke experience was ruined the first time because a liberty prime user lagged me out to the point my game stopped responding until after that person left the area.   
---
Always remember, "It Just Works!"
---
Any new weapon and PA skins coming?
---
Sounds like you've got some network connectivity issues. I know it's the norm to blame everything on Bethesda but ISP's and hardware can be shitty too.
---
Lucky hole mine is great and all but I hate having to use so much acid
---
My lead run is
---
1.the Lodge at flatwoods
---
2. The firestation
---
3. Hornwright Estate (there is a workout room)
---
4. Monorail.
---
5. The penitentiary in the yard has weights
---
Lastly the mine of u haven't gotten enough from those spots.
---
So they ended it after exactly two weeks instead of when they said it was going to end. Got it. Silly me for assuming all the other events were on eastern time so this one would be too. they decided to throw an unnecessary curve ball and have this one end on New Zealand time. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
You can still be on that world your camp just can't be placed at that time. When you do connect to another server it will place your camp without having to relocate.
---
You can starve or thirst to death, if that's what you're asking?
---
Holy cow, another duping method ?Will they EVER be able to stop with the duping shit?
---
Me and a friend joked about this last night. 250drwr has been broken since beta and there is still no fix for that on the horizon. They break the conditions of armour and within 1 week they are implementing a hotfix. I think the community will riot again if this happens.
---
God yes
---
Oh I didn't kno about a gym at the university... Thanks
---
Oh come on, not everything us Bethesda's fault. You had plenty of time prior to the last day to do this...
---
More time. Like just an extra day or two.
---
OwO uWu owo
---
I've got a kill switch which shuts the keypad door to stop high level players taking advantage of the cheap I sell low rank players . Some players are just greedy ..
---
With 16x the detail they are able to now see the inner working of the lock mechanisms and apply their lock picking skillz
---
My dad worked at a steel mill. He tells stories of roaches so big they couldn't fit under the door. They would wait for someone to open it for them, and run through
---
I've launched a ton on peoples camp's
---
Tried once failed due to power armor bug. :/
---
It's really not hard to do solo, just somewhat tedious and the place is a bit of a maze.
---
I used to just go to nukes launched by other people most of the time but with the private server thing I'm finally finding reason to use up the 30 or so keycards I have piled up.
---
Lol I actually just tried to launch now and the nuke was about to land when the server shut down for maintenance. I forgot that was today till the countdown started during final launch prep. Figured... whatever. Might as well just launch it.
---
Whats your console? I've got the cal shocks plan for sale
---
If you mean nerfed into a second rate weapon, then yes.
---
If you mean rubberbanding damage, then yes.
---
If you have a bloody or junkies shotgun build, you typically do enough damage to kill something outright and avoid the rubberband, but it's really bad on instigating and anti-armor shotguns.  It's like the legendary effect damage registers, then is canceled out.  Before switching to junkie, I was using an instigating pump action.  I'd watch enemy health drop to 0 then shoot back up to 40-50%.  It hasn't been a problem with junkie weapons so far, but I haven't done much road testing.  Just a lap around the Whitespring, but ghouls are not particularly tough.
---
Using VATS concentrates all the damage into a single hit, and the rubberband effect seems to be negated.  If you can build towards shotguns with points towards Grim Reaper's Sprint and Action Boy, I highly recommend it.
---
Why can’t everyone do this with issues, bug, fixes, updates, fallout 1st?
---
Awesome, quite a few good fixes then. Now let's start on the rest lol.
---
You realize the resource extractors cap out in capacity after about 20 mins, right? You're meant to have to maintain the workshop and come back a few times a hour.
---
What you're asking for is another advantage to "pay to win" mechanics that everyone has pitchforks out for. The inconvenience of resource extraction is the very thing that provides value to said items which gives them value to reward your time in the market.
---
You can't have it both ways. Don't ask for lead, acid, etc to become worthless because collecting it is effortless.
---
And if you're just bothered by rebuilding structures, that's what blueprints are for.
---
I don't have ESO but if it will help you understand then kindly just line them both up and I can headshot both of them with just one bullet, just make sure The Bethesda logo is front and center, makes an awesome bullseye target.
---
So pretty much looks like they are patching items out that people got from the dev room?
---
I did this for 3 days 2 separate accounts and I'll be pissed if they put it in the atom shop! Just like they did for the pirate hat and why give a fireman helmet for a reward when you can buy 1 from the whitesprings toy store.
---
Who even cares about the Imperials? They're not even that great. They've spent very little time being META.
---
I've launched too many.... The overseer was not happy with me.
---
Early game my friends and I would just run nukes to farm mats to make the rad showers. 
---
Nukes used to be the ONLY way to get raw flux and hardened masses, so crafting syrums and showers and certain under armor layers was more difficult.
---
&gt;Because that is a group mission and I always play alone.
---
You can solo the silos just fine, in fact that is easier/quicker most of the time. Having said that,  you're going to want to do it with somebody who know the way around, at least the first time if not a the first few. If you are on PC I could walk you through one if you'd like?
---
played since beta and only launched one and that was before the Explosive nerf
---
Oh, the reason you can't see em opening doors is because of a mutation they developed.
---
Their antennae work like universal remotes, because rads, and pre-war RadSensors were already standard in all U.S. doors after Protrectrons and other security robots failed to grasp how doorknobs operate.
---
they just attack the door like they attack players
---
If you read my comment, I fully agreed with everything u/Morti_Macabre said except blocked people not being allowed to be in the same server as you. 
---
I wasn't replying to you so don't think I was disagreeing with you. I think you make a good point. 
---
If it's your private server, that's a completely different story. Kick whoever you want for whatever reason. 
---
As far as developing mods, Bethesda just needs to allow the owner to upload their in-progress mods to the server in some way, they don't need full access to the server. That's not terribly complicated. One way would be to upload them to the Bethesda.net mod "store", but have an "in development" option (perhaps with git support), so that it's not public, and is only usable for testing by the dev. That would also allow easy download to the private server, as well as easy download for any players who join said server once the mod is public and installed on someone's server. But it would also restrict all mods to Bethesda.net which would kinda suck, but that's what consoles have anyway. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I would much rather have the server code to run on my own hardware or VPS, for free, so you can mod it to your hearts content, perhaps in addition to Bethesda's hosting option for players that want a server but don't want to mess around with the code or don't have the setup for it. I just don't see that happening, given bethesda's greed as of late. I really hope they at least release the server code and update the client to connect to arbitrary servers whenever they stop supporting the game, so that it doesn't just die.
---
Its a secret i bet, they work behind the scenes.
---
250 Almost did once but then had a hard lock on my PC.  Haven't seriously tried again.
---
I think vault 79 will be the objective, not a social place. It all seems to be a big treasure hunt (The roadmap showed the vault full of gold) and maby both factions are fighting for the way in
---
I only got up to 1600 xp before I said screw it.  Took too long to get there, I can only imagine the grinding required for 14k.  Hard pass.
---
I've had similar problems before too.  I've done the unequip everything log off then back on and saw an improvement but I'm not sure if that fixed it. 
---
 I've also wondered if its server based or based on traffic in the area.  Sometimes I'll have a server that I'm in danger before I even see ghouls etc...if I bounce out to a different one everything goes back to normal or normalish.  I also seem to have a harder time with stealth on weekend nights vs lower traffic times like early morning during the week.  Lol I'm probably just imagining it or trying to make patterns in my head....if you find a solution please let all of us stealth guys know!
---
yea it was cool how he found the briefcase.
---
&gt; I mostly solo and when they nerfed explosive, my build became much weaker and I can't even think about the amount of bullets I would need to solo the launch mission.
---
 Explosive shotguns are probably the best weapon for silos so long as you have enforcer and the explosives perk on. You can make the Gutsys "dance" until they self-destruct.
---
The bug im trying to fight them for is when the scrap bix took 600lbs of my shit. They still wont meet me out by the flag poles. I paid for the fallout 1st and havent played since day one.
---
I think it depends on the audience. MMO players are so familiar with aggressive monetization practices that they don't even care about them.
---
The problem with F76 is that a good amount of its audience are into single player games, which used to not have microtransactions, aside from DLC (yes, some modern single player games actually have microtransactions).
---
Also, a good amount of the F76 audience seems to not understand that servers are rented by the devs (hence the F1st backlash), which might have something to do with not being familiar with multiplayer games.
---
Yea, so they can put them in atomstore
---
kills with a fat man. I did it with 2 mini nukes
---
I don't know about anyone else, but I never found that I particularly lacked for scrap or the capacity for scrap in my stash box. I always had what I needed in there to build and repair with, just as a result of passively picking up junk during my adventures. Having another box which I could drop more scrap into wouldn't help me or make any difference to me because I'm already doing fine in that respect. It would be, at most, a mild convenience.
---
The whole thing bothers me. Why are we unlocking Halloween themed stuff on Nov 12? Moving these challenges and events forward a week or two would have made sense.
---
Yeah it's not a v good comparison, but ESO is much more predatory than F76. After playing ESO for a while, I actually didn't mind 76's cash shop nearly as much. It's not anywhere near as aggressive and I don't think it could be
---
But the features in question are of such trivial use or importance. Why would anyone dealing in good faith ever actually care?
---
those are the best at SQB fights, no more lost FLux.
---
You probably know this, but if you put a suppressor on a shotgun the accuracy and range suffer horribly.  Like cut in half or worse.  I run without one, and I don't seem to have any accuracy problems with a pump vs a coach gun or combat shotgun.  The reload sucks, though.
---
Then why are you even in this subreddit?
---
I can imagine the people on consoles actually enjoying some matches, though. But on PC it's just not fucking fun, and they aren't doing a goddamn thing about it
---
700 hrs and launched once. A lot of work for little reward
---
 **Exploit:** Addressed a weapon damage exploit. 
---
We won't see Scorchqueens melt under 1 minutes anymore i guess ?  i hope it fixes the weird dmg output most heavyguns can get for weird reasons
---
they already answered that they are going to restore some junk. probably wont be the 200+ fluxes and 50+ vault steel i had, but at least something.
---
true, event should have been out by at least the 24th.
---
I always love these videos! Are you on PS4 or XB1? I always miss that if you identify it somewhere. Anyway, always makes me think about my own CAMP, which has remained fairly similar in framework for a long while now but probably needs some updating. I suffer a bit from the "wasted space warehouse" look. I bet I could bring in left wall one length and clean that up a bit and reduce my budget consumption. Maybe I will work on that!
---
Lmbo
---
They'll do nothing. Next question.
---
and i was aware. you’re not edgy, but thanks for trying for me.
---
Sorry for the harshness, but it's done. If people did not get it then it was not important enough to them and they should not get another chance nor the item for free. Took only around 3 days of light grinding to unlock it so people should have planned their time better. It's a reward item and not a participation trophy. If you earned it then you earned it. Clear and simple.
---
Duping isn’t fixed.  Still able to duplicate anything in the game.
---
It does cover DLC, though. It only does not cover whole expansions to the game.
---
Let's put it in WoW terms -- Battle for Azeroth (8.0) is a new expansion, you have to buy it; 8.0.5, 8.1, 8.2, etc. are "DLC" updates to the game that add new content, new raids, etc., and are free; Shadowlands (9.0) is a new expansion and will require a new purchase.
---
MMOs (and thus, their players) have different expectations than the single-player FO76 crowd, as people keep saying -- and you're really ... misrepresenting some things, which I find frustrating, because ESO does have a lot of problems (I don't even play anymore because of lacking bug fixes, latency issues, lack of QoL for console players, piss-poor treatment of support class players, etc.) so if you want to bring down ESO, there are much better and more relevant points to make.
---
Well if you live in a place where most people speak English and are willing to use voice chat properly, it would be a piece of cake. I was in total 5 times in a teams and 2 times were the perfect conditions and I won. I have 2 solo wins as well and multiple placements in top 5. You just have to be proactive and have a bit of luck. Being a bush wookie is a tactic, but will hinder your abilities in the long run.
---
i too submitted a ticket.  I don't really want them to extend it as i kinda hate playing NW. I had time last night to grind it.  i won't for another week or so.  Unless they leave the timeframe incredibly wide.  I saw when the deadline should have been and i prepared for it.  So just give me the damn thing.  
---
They have not yet responded to my ticket
---
Their racial abilities have changed more than a few times,  as has every other race's. The meta is constantly shifting because of that. They make v good tanks if I remember
---
How do you know this?
---
That really sucks.  I'm on ps4 myself.  I just had a hard time wanting to play.  I decided to rebuild parts of my base instead, as its really the only thing I enjoy about the game anymore.
---
I've only seen consistently weird damage output on my Bloodied LMG. It almost looks like a crazy furious effect on the SBQ ... I've stopped using that weapon though since sub-2 minute kills doesn't really help others joining the fight.
---
What kind of weird damage output have you seen on your heavy guns?
---
So they forgot about these on PS4 I have come across.
---
Vendor menu lag
---
Unable to pick up US Supply tapes (says weight limit exceeded)
---
Excess PS4 blue screens
---
Un killable ghouls standing still
---
Ghouls sliding on the floor
---
Doors say Close when they're already closed (quickly open then close again when you open them)
---
Player characters stuck in place when they're some place else on the map
---
Queen of the Hunt quest won't complete when entering sample
---
Unable to fast travel to daily events sometimes
---
Enemies sometimes spawn under ground or in walls
---
Random infinite loading screens
---
VATS in melee is sometimes un responsive
---
Opening the favorites wheel sometimes switches to the emote wheel
---
Turrets disappearing from camp and unable to make more unless you scrap whatever it was placed on
---
Character keeps randomly stopping and sounding like he's taking damage even when no enemies are around
---
Sometimes items in the Atom shop have a blank tile and no pictures
---
Campfire tales quest not rewarding badges
---
Entering nuclear winter mode auto completes some or all daily and weekly atom challenges in adventure mode making it impossible to earn atoms
---
Legendary enemies sometimes fall though the ground or disappear the moment they are killed making it impossible to loot them
---
It does apply like drywall to it. I have a mix of warehouse and brick throughout my build and when you put the wallpaper on it's all even
---
this isnt about you - it is about which mechanics are avalible to use/abuse in the game .  Fallout 1st gives you several tools to gain pretty big advangetes . Whether you use them or not doesnt change that
---
I guess we are back to having to repair armor. Sad, but fair.
---
I think it was more boredom than anything else.
---
Seconded/Thirded. I use the scrapper perk along with all weapons I collect from West Tek and anywhere else. Currently sitting on 4000+ steel.
---
I role play as myself in game so I asked myself. If I had possibly lost family members to a nuke and seen the desrepair of the world after coming out of a vault for 25 years, would I use a nuke even if it's the last resort? Nope not gonna happen, even if it means ii lose out of 80 atoms I can easily get those from the daily/weekly challenges so I'm with Roger Maxon on this one. Doesn't mean I won't travel to nuke zones to farm when they pop up but it won't be me pressing the button.
---
They make OK tanks. Like I said, they've spent very little (if any) time in the actual META. I do (did, until very recently) all vet endgame content; trust me, I'm aware.
---
It sure was strange to begin with ,indeed.
---
Maybe they started it early beacuse they realized the timing of the two parts was so off, that only a ridiculous small % of players would have been able to play mischief night with that costume. All others would have unlocked it later.
---
  Just as strange as giving hours and times for the first part ,but a random 29 to 12 for the second.
---
I haven't really misrepresented the crown store, everything I've mentioned is in there. I guess when I said "most things offer some sort of benefit" wasn't entirely true but there are a great many things like that. The atom shop is much more tame than the crown store
---
I had an asortment of flux. Like a couple steel since i only did the raid once for fear of losing my character.lmao. why is this game still downloaded on my ps4. I cant play it for fear of losing my shit.  The only reason to play is to get shit.lol
---
Did you take a regular Rad-X? I was confused for a bit when I got my first mutations, they seemed like they'd just quit working suddenly. Then I realized that regular Rad-X suppresses your mutations for 10 minutes. You need to take Rad-X: Diluted to avoid the suppression effect.
---
If you are indeed taking Diluted and already know about this little quirk, ignore me! I just know that it puzzled the hell out of me at first (and has done so to many others, I'm sure).
---
All that did was provide them with a stable income of flux materials, nuking workshops is a brilliant idea for the person that owns it because each defend mission that pops up has mutated flux enemies.
---
Basically you did these guys a solid.
---
Bloodied is not a problem by itself. The unyielding + bloodied unarmed is what breaks the game in half. 
---
Bloodied weapons should not be nerfed.
---
When I play I launch at least one per session.. doesn't take too long.
---
What are you talking about it ended early?
---
Sorry, you're right. I noticed I have four bloodied combat rifles and I thought I had three, so I think I was comparing the wrong ones.
---
regarding purveyor Murmrgh, you gotta ask yourself the dirt harry question: "do i feel lucky?"
---
if you do, then yes, but don't be suprised if you get some garbage-ass weapon with an even worse effect.
---
if you don't, then don't even bother, it's for your own sanity.
---
Not on PC until they implement proper anti cheat.
---
If they’re fixing what I think they’re fixing, it’s a legendary effect that was bugged to work a little too well on some automatic weapons.
---
It would be nice, but I don’t think they’re fixing the strangler power armor/legacy plasma combo.  That’s likely what’s melting the queen in seconds.
---
I was actually about to bring up Assassin's Creed: Greece about their single player microtransactions but you already covered that lol good points
---
Lvl 230 and launched so many nukes i have lost count lol
---
Actually Ive been here since the BETA on PS4. I would like to get the PC version of 76 but with all the shit going down Im probably gonna stay with the console version.
---
I was trying to throw out some suggestions on how to resolve the cheating/hacking problem 76 on PC has.
---
No this is just a random drop in health.  I haven't reached the starving or thirst point. I'll randomly be walking somewhere or at a workbench and just take a loss of health.
---
RIP Bloodied Meathook exploit.
---
Yes but you guys are missing the point. A rifle can use all the dmg buff perks and sneak perks, out shining pistols by a long shot. Moving the dmg buff perks to perception would allow gunslingers to use more stealth perks too and balance out the difference to a degree
---
I wondered how this was happening. I saw someone do like 3 queens in a row one night and she melted in literal seconds.i couldn't get off shots. By the time I ran to her she was dead.
---
Ill do it but only if I have to.
---
I soloed a silo about a month ago and threw it towards morgantown for the cobalt flux. Ive launched two nukes as of today.
---
Furthermore how can feral ghouls open doors?
---
I got them from doing the four quests you find on the noticeboard at Van Lowe Taxidermy.
---
Agreed
---
If people just got it for trying, I'd be annoyed...Next time they should try harder and not procrastinate.
---
I'm level 203 or so and I haven't personally launched one. I've participated in going through one of the launch sites with a friend, but he launched it.
---
I was just attempting to do it again but solo last night, and partway through someone else nuked prime, so I abandoned my mission to help slay the queen.
---
It will lead to the demise of 76. If Bethesda can pull their heads out of the cash cows ass and write a good compelling story like Fallout 3, they will hit a home run with Wastelanders.
---
Shhh, don't ruin this for me.😀 They actually fled the area and didn't go back the 30 minutes i stayed on afterwards. I kept checking
---
There's a lot of things I'm happy to see here, but the best one is the one where they're removing items from the dev room that made it into game
---
This is the worst game ever
---
They seem like incredibly minor advantages to me. And beyond that: Why would I care if anyone else has such an advantage? Why would that negatively impact me in any way? Good for them. I'm glad they're having a good time. It's not a zero sum game where someone else's success costs me anything. 
---
Ah, I'm just repeating myself at this point. Either you're not listening to what I'm saying or you're just committed to being angry about nothing and thus it doesn't matter what I have to say.
---
I'm going to bed.
---
Next time you're at the Whitespring, pick up all the coat hangers.  There are 20 or so on the coat racks west of the main entrance, and dozens more in the armor shop and clothing shops.  There are richer sources, of course, but I can't think of any easier ones!
---
10k+ damage with food buffs added
---
For american it started on the 28th and ended on the 11th because of time zones, and they think they got scammed.
---
There's no way to charge power armor. You have to get a completely new set each day. You can usually find them in your stash box which is where the CAMP is also kept. 
---
If you farm corn you can usually find power armor parts near the roots.
---
Congrats on keeping your $5!
---
Hope they arent nerfing my two shot LMG.
---
Ill find out when I get home today when I run west tek.
---
Takes me about 15 minutes to run and loot all the super mutants at west tek.
---
&gt; a final curiosity thing, where is everyone getting the info that vaults were designed for solo??? we knew pre 94 release that they would be team content via ITV articles. then the misc mission says team of 50+
---
I think a lot of people are just used to playing a certain way and assumed Vault 94 would follow the same basic pattern. After all, every single location except Vault 94 can be cleared by either face tanking everything or sneak-killing everything, then looting the place at your leisure.
---
It really is. They nailed the themes man. Nailed it. 
---
The unionization and automation are a combination of this region’s past and present problems. 
---
The major companies wiping out small towns as big mega corporations move in? Check. 
---
Government and secretly dumping chemicals into the water supply a-la DuPont? Running secret experiments in the hills like say the Tuskegee experiment? Double check. 
---
Mining DESTROYING the area, and the companies don’t care about the repercussions or the workers? Yuuuup. 
---
Whoever wrote the lore did their homework. 
---
Except for certain fallout at large exceptions. But we dare not speak of such a topic in polite company. Lol.
---
Rip my marine helmet
---
Hardly an issue if you ask me.
---
Damn... Never used it myself, but had a few friends that could kill the Queen in under a minute with it.
---
Dont u have to do a mission in white springs to be able to launch?
---
Imagine dropping your wallet in da hoodz then ask the friendly bystanders whether they’ve seen it. Truth is if they can rob or steal your other belongings they will.
---
Datamining?
---
Yeah, IMO the time spent gathering materials to craft all the foods needed for the buffs negates the time you save killing the queen. I did not see it that practical.
---
Why is it dumb when the only difference is how the gun is loaded. Same shell from the same barrel design does the same damage. Not a shit ton extra cos you chose the wrong loading mechanism
---
Level 100, still haven't taken the firebreathers test...
---
My character was maybe around 95ish, and I launched a nuke or two. Probably my favorite mission to do out of everything that was available at the time.
---
Haven't yet, but when I do I'm bombing that annoying Raider robot. I can't actually kill her, but she's the worst.
---
I did it just to clear out the goal in the quest list.  I was probably around your level.  I did it solo, and it was a tedious, fucking bore.  I'll never do it again.  
---
I'm glad other players like doing it, because I like exploiting nuke zones.  I also enjoy queen fights.
---
I've played 5 different characters, levels between 160 - 280. Tried once, crashed so many times that I didn't bother after that.
---
Lmao “amirite” 😂😂😂
---
There is a script on PC that lets you mod the damage of your weapon. That is likely all that they're fixing damagewise.
---
hey 
---
Why do you think i am angry ?  Because i disagree with you ? i am not angry -  i still play the game.  I do read what you write - i get that you dont think it is a big advangetes . But i am telling you it IS - if you use the tools you get - it is you that dont listen.
---
I mean there was plenty of time to get it done. I never play NW and I only started after mischief night ended. I got all the rewards completed about 3 days ago in less than 50 matches. If you are good at hide n seek you can get into the top 10 and survive 20 mins pretty consistently. Landing you at least 400 xp each round. I actually really enjoyed being a Bush wookie, so I think I'll be playing it more. I'll probably join some teams and actually try to win this time. :)
---
As to what bethesda should do. They could extend it 6 hours, but I dont see the point. People are still going to complain in this sub. There is no pleasing some people. 
---
If anyone wants some NW survival tips let me know. I've gotten pretty good at cheesing exp. Hahaha.
---
And vice versa
---
are you wondering why your berserker "gauntlet" is doing less damage with armor on?
---
I doubt it, TS was nerfed a long time ago it is not overpowered now.
---
Neither is for me,we all had exactly 14 days.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
So my useless response from bethesda : 
---
" Greetings,
---
Thank you for contacting Bethesda Support.
---
The witch is not included in the Halloween bundle.
---
The Halloween C.A.M.P. Bundle includes:....."
---
Ugh, I never even mentioned a witch outfit in my ticket...  My Ticket was "Nuclear Winter Glowing Skeleton Outfit..."
---
Imposter SheepSquach
---
Ie, The Encyptied Event
---
While mouth breathing with your mic turned on
---
 Though I guess they could hotfix some other damage things, I doubt they're fully aware of those specific cases yet.
---
Won't fix game breaking bugs, but will fix what they're losing money on, screw bethesda...
---
Instead of referring to items as "bugs", if we start referring to everything that is broken as an "exploit" maybe they will fix it. The sliding ghoul "exploit", the fast travel "exploit".  Seems to be the only thing they will actually take time to fix.
---
Marine Helm was about during BETA, that's why they didn't bother taking them away and allowing people to still have them so I would doubt they would remove them now.
---
...still, this is Bethesda after all.
---
Think they were more on about the weapons which weren't meant to be available
---
&gt; As far as developing mods, Bethesda just needs to allow the owner to upload their in-progress mods to the server in some way, they don't need full access to the server.
---
As a dev I'm telling you now - that is as unrealistic as trying to repair a car engine with a blindfold on.
---
The main difference is that ESO prices for expansions/dlc are quality content and the BASE game of ESO has significantly more content than Fallout76. Someone can buy ESO for $9.99 and play hundreds if not thousands of hours in the base game alone. That player can then subscribe to ESO+ and get ALL of the dlc game packs and monthly crowns (akin to fallout) except instead of only being able to buy worthless shit like cosmetics or refrigerators they can actually buy expansions with the crowns. 
---
The ONLY thing i will agree with you on is how over priced some of the houses are. Those are ridiculous. Everything else? No it’s fine. Also I think you mentioned stat boosting pets? Yeah that’s false. Also one more thing, remember FO76 is not technically an MMO it’s a “shared world” ESO is a massive MMO running massive servers. So unfortunately in this day an age MTXs do play a part.
---
How did it take 600lbs of stuff, did it scrap it all when you didn’t want it scrapped or did it just disappear after going into the scrap box? I’ve got Fallout 1st but was so caught up with the halloween event that I didn’t pay much attention to it and wondering now if I should have :) thanks for any info :)
---
Which effect do you think it was?
---
They probably meant it to be 12:00AM instead, but mixing up AM and PM is the level of incompetence I've come to expect at this point.
---
That's one of the fixes. Forget the litany of other bugs that have existed since the inception of the game.
---
Ya know, not waiting until the last minute to do tha challenges helps.. not saying that there is a problem but this event has been out for a hot minute and we knew the update was today and sometimes they shut down early or late, this is the way of the beast. Sorry to those who didn't get their rewards(me because c'mon, NW)
---
Ain’t nobody got time for dat
---
I could be wrong, but I've noticed it seems to only do that when I switch from one power armor to another and it inserts my lowest core into the armor I have not yet used.
---
I find this s bit strange, had to repair my Armor last night, so it must have been taking dmg:/
---
Judging by the pace of development, no one would be in the office anyway.
---
Never..but to be fair, I have only one character that's lvl 28. :-)
---
I think we should be able to turn into a ghoul from too much radiation for too long or a super mutant from FEV exposure. I'm hoping they introduce it with the factions in Wastelanders and have a ghoul and super mutant town where you will get better prices etc. or even have some human towns where you are shunned or attacked. Other MMOs have different racial options with the relevant pros and cons and it could work great in 76.
---
Exactly the same as yours ;D
---
Not really going to tone down my expectations for any reason at this point. They should have realized their mistake and started development on it last year. They still have two months to go. If they can't pull something decent together for the Wastelanders launch it'll be the death knell of this game.
---
Yes, or just always use UTC.
---
don't know what all these guys are on about but bloodied stealth commando is up there
---
Idk but I’d like the extra time I’d totally finish grinding all the way to 14000 even though I’m only at 3400 but even if they just gave me the one reward I was so close to well id still b pretty happy. Some people argue time zones on this issue but I guarantee u none of them have looked into the start time and if it’s truly an issue of time zone. Unless they suddenly changed the implied time zone they usually start and end things for them that is just not the case! Never before have I seen an event end a day early and that’s cause it’s not a time zone thing — it’s a fluke or an anomaly!  All I really wanted was to get to my next reward the one I was so close to. 
---
I didn’t start grinding Nw until yesterday and I dislike playing the mode it’s just not for me so to get that close and then lose it sucks! I left before finishing getting my last bit of course for that reward cause I was hungry and had already put off getting lunch for a while! Plus u know I thought I was told it ended today.. so I thought I had time. I’d like extra time above all else and that way I can decide how much grinding I do but I don’t realistically think they’ll give us everyone of the rewards, maybe they could look at our earned do so far and determine if we should get more rewards but even that is unfair because some people may have been out of town or planning a last minute grind. There’s too many situations to account for so I think more time on the clock makes the most sense
---
I carry 3 PA’s so I’ll test that one out as well. Weird thing is they all have cores and I’ve never removed a core from a PA since we don’t really have to since it automatically replaces them when at 0 power. 
---
They hardly weigh anything and I have at least 10 on my character all the time.
---
I am level 248 and have never launched a Nuke before. I once made it to the silo. Got all the way to the launch room with my girlfriend then the password reset for the nuke launch (We did it on the day the password resets, about an hour before the midnight reset) it took us too long to do the silo and we ended up stuck in the launch room, used our only nuke card and the password had expired. Gutted.
---
Use wood walls
---
I want sneaky archer nerfed on Skyrim.
---
They just released a pet that gives you inventory space, that's a stat. Also are you okay with $50 bank/merchant NPCs? There's more than just the houses that are ridiculous, they charge you for something that should have been in the base game, the Imperials
---
Unfortunately,  the OP builds that are geared towards killing the Queen can still take her down in seconds. I can solo her in less than a minute when she lands. That is without any exploits.
---
thx hotfixed it after 1 or 2 days. so no worries. it cant happen anymore.
---
we just got the stuff deleted.
---
It was hardly difficult to obtain. I took me 2 days to grind out the xp and I have never played NW before. I just took all the advise other people gave me. Hide in a Bush till the top 5 and get easy xp. I understand people have commitments, I have commitments too but I put time aside to grind an outfit I really wanted. If people wanted the outfit that bad they had 2 weeks to find time to get the outfit.
---
The cores are currently visualized in really strange way.  Example if you put on in your PA, it will then show up in your ammo,even if it's inside the PA(which is in your pocket). Same if you put a frame with a core inside in your stash.
---
Which weapons are those?
---
Nuking for flourecemt flux only done it 3 times , found that prime fissure and whitesprings are good for it so im vibing
---
Well the two stability fixes for server crashes I would consider a game breaking bug that they're fixing.
---
Too late on the dupe exploit. Everyone did it. Fallout 1ST members, myself included have unlimited scrap thanks to the storage box.
---
Seriously, this was poorly handled and should have been fixed before it became common knowledge. Especially with unlimited scrap storage.
---
Why did I get downvoted???
---
There's realism then there's balance they're two different things. In a video game we're looking for balance.
---
Suspend your disbelief otherwise the 50 cal would be ripping off arms and legs with the first shot and wouldn't be balanced. 
---
Again we're talking about balance not realism. 
---
All the other Shotguns hold a lot more rounds. You're constantly reloading shoot twice reload repeat. There should be a damage increase otherwise they're useless against a mob. Or make them reload quicker that'd also work for balance.
---
r/downvotesreally
---
There are groups that this is all they do and their builds are optimized to do it quickly. Queen Killers are Us, FEV, Wasteland Republic are a few.
---
&gt;I believe if you quickly leave the server &amp; rejoin it fixes it.
---
Yes, this works fine, did it at WS this past weekend
---
I've had that happen a few times during combat and I'm walking around for a few minutes and then BAM, dead.
---
It's like the client checks with the server to see if you should be dead and the server has the guys at the DMV checking and getting back to it with the info.
---
Agree, they shouldn't have fixed server stability, thats just stupid!
---
Ok so your "stash" can hold 800lbs. After purchasing  fallout first i entered the game and emptied all the junk from my stash. 200lbs of clothes,aid items, misc. Was left. So i just did the math. I had 600lbs of shit on my character. I then placed a "scrapbpx" included from fallout 1st. I placed my stuff in and was hunky Dori for the rest of my session. Cut to the next day i get on and my "scrap box" is empty. It just ate my shit. And i havent gotten any if it back and its been weeks.
---
Level 70, have no desire to launch a nuke. I might reconsider in the future but typically play solo.
---
I haven't yet either.  I want to do it to finish the quest, but I have to find a time with 4ish hours to get through one of the silos.  Last time I had to give up after a couple of hours.  
---
Most of my gaming time is now being spent looking for work. :/
---
Balance is still same shell just different loading mechanism so still same damage. You just killed yourself with your own argument
---
I also carry 3 sets, and never remove cores. I just noticed it doing that a while back and I'm pretty sure it did not do that before.
---
I carry all of mine to save stash weight (currently 82) and it seems the lowest always get used first when it comes to PA now. Weapons I have not tested so I'm not sure.
---
Good lord reading is apparently way more important than shooting
---
Why lol
---
Do you just leave and log back in and it reliably puts you back in the same server, or do you join on a friend/mule?
---
160 something here and I tried once and got DQed as I was installing cores. I've never bothered to try again.
---
12am what time? NOT EST, it was gone before 7pm on the 11th of November.
---
Level 230 and haven't done it. My level 215 husband launched his first two this weekend on Morgantown and WS to gather flux. We've had so many scorchbeasts in threes and fours lately that we have zero desire to launch on the Queen.
---
There's countless problems in the game, even the walls in nuclears winter are not legit, there's wallbreaches and that stuff everywhere man!!! I see two legitimate problems fixed on this list, 
---
the rest are exploits that are losing them money, they have no other motivation to fix the things that can make the game better
---
250DR?
---
Laser Musket, for starters. 
---
And people have also found a "Paintball gun," which is a pipe rifle that shoots paintballs instead of bullets. Bethesda already soft patched the latter by increasing it's weight to 200 (making anybody who had it overweight) and renaming it to "JUNK rifle" (with caps). It still shoots paintballs, despite this.
---
I've noticed something about this but it's hard to explain. The fusion core is actually put into your inventory after you get out of your power armour and collect it. If that fusion core is still in your inventory when you place your power armour then it automatically goes in. If you have used/stored/dropped that particular core then the PA will not have another automatically put in when you place. I hope my explanation is understandable.
---
OK boomer
---
I just want a fucking half stairc... I mean empty pumpkin rack
---
Level 81, only launched the one nuke - never again, tedius grind, not at all enjoyable. Never killed the queen, zero point, likewise, don't farm stuff. Not here to farm rare materials/legendaries. Barely done any events either, they are not part of Fallout in my mind. I'm here for exploration and story.
---
Personally I wanted a full blown mmorpg, hit I can see the appeal of what you are describing.
---
Level 78 - never launched one.  Primarily because I only play solo sneak and don't want to repeatedly die.
---
I've launched 2, the first when I was level 142 with the help of a group of friends, then I launch one solo the next day and never got bothered with launching another...
---
WHY ARE YOU STILL PLAYING
---
Such as my nocturnal probe with 40% extra comforting 👌
---
High stakes? Like losing a desk fan when you die?
---
I did a run once with some folks, but I didn't launch it
---
It was OK I guess
---
Right... I’m just wondering why it’s taken out of the PA when stored... it’s part of the PA so technically should be in that and not removed.
---
Oh wow! That massively sucks! I didn’t even know that the stash box had a limit I thought it was limitless like the craft bag on ESO. Hope you have some luck with Bethesda soon!
---
i did launched my first nuke at level 30-something at the fissure site near watoga and successfully took down the scorchedbeast queen with the whole server
---
Interesting ... :-)
---
If you don't mind sharing, what's the secondary effect on your heavy guns that have this "issue"?
---
Thank you for the hotfix update! Shame that they deleted the stuff though :(
---
Just take your camp out of whitesprings
---
Hahaha!! Idiot
---
This is why I don't like the Rejuvenated perk card.
---
I know, it's something they broke last week I believe as it never used to do that.
---
The jack o skins are pretty cool
---
Right! It’s only over the last 1-2 months that this has happened and I don’t remember it happening before. 
---
I usually only wear PA in nuke zones or knowing we’ll be fighting harder enemies... just kinda weird.
---
\*sigh\* I guess fixing issue where you crash when accessing vendors (NPC, player shop and legendary scrap vendor machine) still not a priority. It's, right now, my #1 crashing issue on PS4.
---
You're asking bethesda for a QOL upgrade. Don't hold your breath.
---
What guns can you put them on? So far I’ve only found the 10mm🤣
---
You want your Chinese spy to be an obvious Chinese spy? Not a great spy there my dude.
---
No, you will get statistics on the NW halloween event and they might adress the cheating on PC
---
I'm level 102 and I've launched hundreds of them
---
...it’s just north of Alpha on the acid deposit. I was at Whitesprings Station when I kept reloading
---
I must have been living under a rock. I never knew a laser musket was in 76.
---
Glad they still haven't bothered fixing the so called "stealth system" in this game that's a complete and utter mess.
---
The comment I was replying to said 
---
&gt;at noon eastern time
---
So it's probably reasonable to assume that's what I meant.
---
r/cringe
---
All the events went live at the same time it ended. They should've specified what time zone they are working off but it didn't really end early. People just assumed it would end when they do maintenance.
---
Combat rifle, combat shotgun, and one other thing
---
I agree with you on some of these, absolutely and my bad I didn’t know about the pet because I haven’t played in awhile. Some things are incredibly expensive but! Guess what? Fo76 will become the same way. It’s all about greed friend. once they get more people paying for fallout 1st and more items they will begin pushing a little more. And a little more. That’s how ESO began after they dropped the sub. 
---
Both games are out to get your money, the question is for you which provides a better cost to entertainment value? For me that’s an easy choice being ESO. It simply has more engaging content, more interesting world to explore, and better quests/world events. But this is all my opinion. Do I defend their outlandish prices? Hell no. But do I pay the sub? Absolutely! I haven’t played in several months but the sub is still active so that when I do get back I have crowns ready to buy something else. For me that works. 
---
My biggest problem with fo76 is the way bethesda handled its monetization. Fo76 is an asset flip of fallout 4 and it’s being monetized like it’s a new game.
---
Bingo. Too much nerf already. Meanwhile tommygun and 10mm can definitely use some love. This game’s weapons and builds are very inadequately balanced
---
I mean you're really missing out on the missiles they force on you and make you overencumbered
---
I almost responded by arguing the underlying point, but I know it’s a complete waste of time.  You see a vase and I see two faces in profile.
---
With 4 meats that take only a couple minutes to gather,  fury and alcohol,  you can do upwards if 10k damage. Well worth it.
---
It's kind of a pain in the ass to launch one and takes a shit ton of resources if you solo through it.
---
I deployed the pa and got in it... got out, stored it and dropped 2 fusion cores to a friend. 
---
I deployed PA again and it goes through the outing core in video... 
---
So I’m thinking they changed fusion cores in some way inventory wise so they are removed from PA when stored but automatically gets placed back in when deployed.
---
When I didn’t give any cores away, it doesn’t happen.
---
Less than 10
---
I hate you &gt;:(
---
Six Six
---
Few people know because it was cut from the base game. All references to the Laser Musket in the files have (CUT) next to them, despite even being reworked to fit the new weapon modding system for this game
---
**HOWEVER,** it appears it will likely make a return in the Wastelanders DLC, since you can see a glimpse of it strapped onto somebody's back in the promo image (the same one with the Plasma Caster)
---
I was in the same boat as you, and thought the same thing - what's the point if everyone is already doing it - but then I thought there are times when I'm on a server and nothing gets launched, it's in those types of servers that I'd like to be the one to wake everyone up.  I'm level 141 now I think and just launched my first nuke a few days ago.  And just did another one yesterday.  First time, my friend ran through it with me and gave me all the pointers on what to do, etc., and we were done in no time (even showed me a short cut.)  Yesterday I tried going in there by myself and I guess I wasn't paying attention the first time, got lost on a step or two, luckily another gamer must have saw that I was taking a lot of time in there, and came into the silo and helped me.  Then the same gamer revived me during a critical time in the SBQ fight.  She was about dead and I just dropped to one knee, ... I thought great, I'm going to respawn, she'll be dead, and her body is going to disappear on me... but this guy came out of nowhere again and saved me.  Forgot to send him a msg yesterday, will do when I get home.  He saved the day! ...Well he made sure I got my 1 star shovel from the Queen.
---
Better late than never, but man, I kinda lol'ed reading these patch notes and realizing it was for an 1yr old game from an AAA publisher and not some early-access game from an indie dev from Kickstarter...
---
It usually lasts until it's over.
---
Looking at past maintenances average down time is around 4 hours.
---
Thanks
---
 Sorry for the harshness, but it's done. If people did not get it then it was not important enough to them and they should not get another chance nor the item for free. Took only around 3 days of light grinding to unlock it so people should have planned their time better over two weeks. It's a reward item and not a participation trophy. If you earned it then you earned it. Clear and simple.
---
Just launched my first nuke yesterday. Level 123. Did it on a private server as I had heard that people try and steal people's launches. Nuke The Whitespring and all the ghouls were dead. Found out later that it's dependent on someone else coming into the area for everything to respawn, but I already left the server. Oh well. Next time I know.
---
Imagine this: Events where you enter and are teleported to a Instanced Team Deathmatch, Raiders vs Settlers (No legendary effects). Picture a true survival game, no legendery, players can loot all your gear, exaustion, cold, warmh.  Add the Brotherhood in another wastelanderssized DLC... or the enclave...   
---
They can do alot... they just need to put more then 5 people working on the game.
---
Not epic very bad
---
They can. I have all black turrets at my camp.
---
It's not released yet but there are plenty of items that are not available but already in the code. Some unique clothes too for example.
---
Thanks for going in depth, this reply made a lot of sense. I also agree with your points a lot. But I still doubt that F76 will come close to ESO's prices but I'll probably come back to this comment and eat some crow
---
But Bethesda could have meant something else, who knows. And either way they were gone on the 11th not the 12th
---
Level 80, 40, and 40 (I like trying different builds). I've never launched a nuke, finished the raiders or BOS, or EVEN started Enclave.
---
its so easy. i run west tek anyways, so its already 2x buffs. to the insect daily and you will find yaos for the 3rd buff.
---
you can then cook the better meals for a 4th and 5th buff. and there are still more if i remember correctly. its doenst really need farming and is the reason melee is so heavily overpowered.
---
with alle the buffs and uny gear i had around 3k damage with a vampire swingspeed meat hook.
---
Why not? After doing it 2 or 3 times it takes 15 min max, not a lot of ammo if you sneak and you can launch them wherever you want.
---
Haven’t had one crash, myself. How’s your connection?
---
I don’t think it actually comes from that. I’ve done it so many times and never have I received it.
---
Skills like that are what makes him a radroach; otherwise, he's be a just-okroach
---
I find your optimism regarding developers level of commitment and skill to not shoot themselves in the foot very refreshing.
---
personally, i would like to see them changed from PvP encounters to CO-OP encounters. 
---
IE skip fighting over it and get to the defense part.  any player present when a wave is defeated is awarded with appropriate results from the factory. in this way people would be encouraged to help defend it and maintain its defenses over time and the owner would simply get more resources than other players.  (but also have to be present to gain anything). 
---
instead of the PvP aspect, the location would be assaulted by waves every few minutes until its reset to neutral.
---
Don't know why I just got the notification of this reddit post now but you're kind of screwed, it's the 12th now
---
Yeah this always happens to me too on PS4. I find it's a guaranteed session-ender if I've been playing for an hour before I visit a vendor (or my stash box).
---
I swear the Mothman has it out for my ass in particular, and only when I'm on a character that can't just one-shot him.
---
I've been back in the game for about a month and a half. In that time, I've gotten one character to 200, one to 60 and one to 25. The guy who's level 200 was, when low level, tortured for several days by that fucking mothman. Four days in a row, at least one attack per day, from when I was about level 15 to 45. Even attacked me at my own CAMP once.
---
One day he attacked after I'd reached level 100 or so and I blew his face off in one shot. He has not come after that particular character since.
---
Then I was working on the guy who's now level 60. This time it wasn't as bad, but had encounters with the Mothman two days in a row when at levels that I couldn't have possibly taken him on (especially since trying to do stealth melee doesn't really become viable until 25+ or so).
---
Mothman hasn't bothered the level 60 since I decided to try out Bloodied and could now probably rip his face off.
---
The level 25 had two Mothman encounters in *less than an hour* last night.
---
Conclusion: The Mothman is a damn bully who prefers to pick on low levels!
---
My cat can open doors, I'm sure its similar to that.
---
And everyone ignores a great fact again. There are indeed groups that do this. People are on standby in silos to fire nukes. Queen dies literally in 3 minutes. They always have the stealth melee guy with a bloody meat hook, and everyone else geared to kill the queen only.
---
I’ve launched 2 so far, both solo. Neither time was I really properly prepared for the SBQ
---
Light grinding? I played for several hours a day! The game has hackers and you only get xp if you last long or place top 10. 9/10 team members SUCK and I’m aggressive; I’m not just gonna sit in a lil corner watching a door trying to survive top 10. If the fuckin date says NOVEMBER 12TH 12PM then it should be then. CLEAR AND SIMPLE
---
What if u were occupied in other ways. Everyone has a life outside of this game? Come on that’s unfair — what should b cut and dry is that the announced start and end times were followed. If ur boss tells u that u have until Friday to do something and u plan a schedule that allows u to do that, whether or not u do it first thing or at the end of that time period u r within ur rights and if that boss comes a day early and says where is it? Then fires u... while Bethesda didn’t fire us they pulled the rug from under our feet and that’s what the offense is. It’s not up to people to do things the first day of the timespan. I imagine u got all the rewards or maybe didn’t participate? What if they needed it a week early! Would it still b people’s fault for not doing it day one
---
I wouldn't be surprised if the private server improvements come out sometime mid january as a means to retain players till wastelanders arrives. They likely have christmas or new years content planned and I'm guessing the valentines day stuff in the game files will finally see the light of day in february, but I can't see anything else they'd drop in mid January.
---
eso has literally so much content and stuff in it - the Monetisation is shitty, yes, but 3 months of a subscription in eso does me a lot better than fo76 -
---
Equally, then, 3 months without the sub is better in ESO - for what I initially paid for the game - $30, not bad imo. 
---
Fo76 just doesn't have the content there for equal treatment
---
everything gets scrapped
---
That's exactly what I experience, I normally drop low charged cores all the time as I have an abundance of 100% charged ones. Whenever I have done this and tried to jump into my pa it does that silly animation of putting the core in. Very annoying when you're just trying to hop into PA because you're getting attacked from all sides. Hopefully this wasn't done on purpose and they work to fix it.
---
There has been no mention of Patch 15 yet... you will get nothing today... patch 15 was meant to be wastelanders... patch 15 will now probably only come in December to add the Winter Event
---
&gt;However, thanks to YouTube
---
&gt;Even though the game is half broken,
---
If you get most of your info on the game from YouTube I can see why you think that's the case, but the reality is somewhat different.  I play on PC and I personally am unaware of any game breaking bugs. There are glitches and bugs but I dont know of any games with none, they can occasionally be annoying but few ever actually ever interfere with my gameplay.  Mostly they are just funny
---
Ive tried paying 80k plus for extra ones at this point and have been turned down.
---
You get plans for taking a Workshop?!
---
NW fix?
---
fyi if you scrap the helmet you learn the plan to make the helmet
---
You can see other player's health -- like a health bar? I genuinely don't think I've ever noticed that.
---
Was it a business radroach? I think they can carry briefcases too.
---
Ugh so no good weapons..?
---
I was at fort defiance. A roach glitched and I couldn’t kill it. Next thing I know he went through the laser grid and went into the elevator....Last member of The Brotherhood of Steel???
---
It can drop from most Ash Heap events, including Battle Bot. It's just absurdly rare.
---
Same for me, stayed up late playing and even told my GF who wanted me to play a different game with her that I wanted to finish the awards for the Glowing Skeleton Skin. Oh, well... if I don’t get it now, maybe it’ll be an award next year we can earn. I submitted a ticket to Bethesda, but they’re not really answering the question.
---
Exactly! I’m not sure why it has to go through the video of placing it in, then pauses so you have to click yet again to get in. 
---
I’m kinda thinking it’s similar to the ammo deal when you have to reload a weapon say when spawning in, it’s always at 0 UNLESS you’re on a private server and oddly your weapon is loaded... ???
---
I have been playing since the beta and I have never launched one. It just hasn't really interested me a great deal. Maybe the only reason I would, is if doing so and killing the SBQ will finally let me complete the defeat tough enemies challenge. But that's about the only reason maybe.
---
Lol that's why you can get about 4 accounts worth of caps or any trade you want for it.
---
Take 1 nuka cola grenade to clear most of that out.
---
Neither did I until some a-hat griefer killed me with one - twice.  I kept thinking "That weapon sounds familiar - wtf was that??" And now I know.  But today his little griefer-gun will be gone.  Victory is Mine !!

The "Finally found it" link in this post shows it as a reward. Whether or not it's **still** part of the reward pool is another question. :S
---
No nukes in 300 hours. I'm here to rebuild American, not to turn into some irradiated wasteland. Also I tend to leave the final quest undone for as long as I can in a game.
---
Looks like no patch 15 today. Maybe not until next year...
---
Why wait until the last day? I chose not to do it but I did 7000 points in 6 hours of gameplay... how hard is to play 1:30 hours per day during 10 days?
---
I still gotta do it for the last quest, but neither have I lol
---
Make it an option to either cut them off or double all prices for blocked people.
---
lvl 335 and launch 3 to 4 a week.
---
I have done it a several times.  The bunker is a nice place for collecting junk materials. And dropping a nuke on cranberry bog activates the SBQ event and theres violet flux to be found.  Its a, fun thing to do when u have a, couple of hours to play.
---
&gt;Eating or drinking from pip
---
What is this one?
---
look at harpers ferry to get it all.
---
I gues not. The combat rifle isnt the best gun but it's a pretty good side gun if you dont wanna thrash your best stuff on weak enemies.
---
Never have I ever launched a nuke.
---
Giving them to everyone kind of defeats the purpose of a rare outfit.
---
Allowing another week with an explicit end time seems like the correct solution.
---
This happens when you reach between 0.01 and 0.49 health. The game is simply rounding the number down to 0.
---
In theory, you should be able to reach this point after you respawn with 750 rads (25% health) and eat between 245 and 249 canned dog food.
---
Yep, I’m doing the circuit daily and then back to that, hopping from server to server for the last week. It’s now my goddamn mission.
---
I’ve no interest in purchasing it from someone for a ridiculous price.
---
Hey I'm pretty quiet too, cheers.
---
Man ive been enjoying not having my armor brake every high lvl legendary that comes around lol
---
So glad they prioritized fixing armor occasionally not taking damage over a hundred other bugs. I was feeling pretty disappointed by how few opportunities I was given to buy repair kits. Now that I’m no longer being robbed of those opportunities my experience will certainly be much better.
---
That’s stupid damage
---
or how at the asylum mobs can get through a security screen that you can't with out a pass key and then use the elevator to travel up three floors.
---
Fair point, I’ve been using this explosive revolver haha but for a diff ammo type for sure good idea
---
Apples and oranges, eso earnt it's right to sell stupidly overpriced digital merch though at least it's quality and all optional, idiot1 can have the biggest most expensive house but it's doesn't do anything for you other than make you feel good. 
---
There's some convenience things in the shop but so easily ignored as you can make your own... so they really don't make much sense. Play eso for a bit and find out. If you sub to eso you get that money back in mtx$ and then you can save it for something bigger, that's how people have afforded the big things.
---
That being said the new development is a bit iffy, and it's only just been a day since it was announced. No one has ever argued the stuff isn't rediculously expensive, it's well documented... and the latest inventory boosting pet could very well lead to a slippery slope, but it's not exactly a stat boost. Either way Bethesda and Zenimax getting rediculously greedy at this point.
---
That or opening the pip boy 
---
The crashing has increased big time the last week or so
---
usually the first crash of the day for a few of us is just opening our pip-boy and eating food or drinking water.  when you hit use, the game crashes
---
There are no rewards. We vault raid for the experience and enjoyment.
---
there is nothing keeping them from future charges of changing face. hell they already purposefully limited storage and building space just so they could sell it. FO76 is going to die off soon.  I don't think any game is worth paying so much a month for when you consider on xbox I already pay for the internet service and xbox live, adding another fee just to get things like storage and build space that should have been free.
---
It's a sporadic crash that happens when using an aid item from your Pip-Boy.
---
Amen
---
I've never launched one myself. I played for a bit at launch, then quit playing up until recently. My highest level character is 153
---
I only started playing again because I wanted to play single player (plus a friend needed some b-roll, so I don't have to pay for it). I'm assuming that you need to have a few people involved when you nuke a place. I suppose that means that I won't be nuking anything any time in the future either.
---
I hate how unspecific this is haha but I love the updates keep em coming
---
This game was a gift from a freind who dindnt like it he said might as well let some1 who enjoys it have it i assume u thought i meant i dindnt play it
---
Yeah, we have to go through a crazy amount of effort to get clearance to the top floor, they just run right up no problem.
---
I had mine done and completed. The mrs asked me Sunday night to help get hers. She had ZERO xp towards it...oof
---
So it's easy to do 1:30 hours per day....its the wife asking with those big green eyes that had me doing it at the 11th hour
---
What's the problem with that?
---
A couple songs got removed after beta. I extracted all the songs and put them on my phone to listen to. I went back later on to extract some other audio and noticed they were missing. Not sure what happened, but some songs just didn’t make the final cut.
---
Holy shit, that must be frustrating. PC?
---
I had 200+ hours played when I stopped and never launched a nuke. Sometimes think I might play again just to experience that. But I’ve moved on until new content drops
---
I live in a world where giant deathclaws pop out of the ground and eat me. A world where mole miners attack my camp. A world where people have floating camps and constantly launch nukes.... I really don't expect any less than a radroach opening a door.
---
yes no problem! yea felt really bad, but since you are able to collect every scrap you find you are really fast back to what you had. and more. but not the fluxes and vault steel. that still haunts me in my nightmares lol
---
Funny, Southern Elsweyr just came out, it's a story zone, and it's free with ESO+.
---
Velociraptors taught them.
---
Yeah level 105 and that last quest has been sitting there for ages.
---
Battle bot is confirmed, and my friend got it from lode bearing, pretty sure it can also drop from any public event in Ash Heap
---
Oh is it a chapter?
---
I don't run into any issues with it.
---
"Ha! My mom's safe now! Tunnel Snakes rule!"
---
*Click*
---
"Who's there? What the...radroaches?! It's not fair! Tunnel Snakes rul-"
---
Level 130. I haven't even finished that quest. LOL
---
yut, it sucks.  hope fixes are on the way
---
The salt will be wonderful.
---
No a chapter is Morrowind, Summerset, and Elsweyr. Your basic game expansions. It's a DLC ala Murkmire, Wrothgar, The Golden Coast, Hew's Bane, etc.
---
Yeah - I can see it when I get close to them - pretty sure it's not one of my mods but I'll have to double check
---
I just did at at level 50 so I could complete the quest line. I didn't realize it was basically end game for the main quest line though and was a little disappointed afterwards. I'll probably do it again with some friends so they can finish the quest up but I don't have a huge desire to go thru the process again.
---
The whole "put the most iconic race behind a paywall" is kind of indefensible. Also the game was in just as bad of shape as F76 at launch. But I especially agree with your last paragraph
---
You don’t drop junk during events anymore Chief
---
Still there.
---
That's not an "exploit."  That's a good build and food management.
---
Oh damn yeah I forgot, Murkmire isn't the dungeon DLC. I don't really count those as they're the original four dlc before they made that switch. Are they moving away from chapters now and going back to their promise that all dlc would be free?
---
I almost did once, and then my “buddy” jumped in and actually launched it.
---
Hard.
---
They have shitty servers.
---
Its very similar and could be related, although the ammo bug has been around for quite some time now. I remember when you could store ALL of your fusion cores on 1 PA frame. Those were the days lol.
---
Not waiting till the last minute would have been the best solution, but no of course this is all evil Bethseda's fault so they should totally give you all free stuff for your own mistakes...
---
They sell repair kits... Why wouldn't they prioritize it? They want the game to become self funded like ESO. Expect similar shenanigans in the future.
---
&gt;Grow up, move on and enjoy life. 
---
Take your own advice
---
This happens to mine as well though mine usually recovers instead of crashing.  I think it’s mainly due to unstable servers and a not-well-built game
---
Level 50 and launched 6 its easy u just need stimpacks and a super sledge
---
Ah, I play on PS4. Kind of sounds like it might be a mod -- is it a health bar or percentage or something that you see?
---
Meat cleavers for everyone!
---
Lvl 120, played  the game for months after release during the whole (buggy) winter. But never launched a Nuke. Abandoned the game last spring but came back some weeks ago for private servers in preparation for Wasteland content update and guess what, just ran my first silo run and launched my first Nuke one year after release...
---
Level 130ish and I've launched a bunch. I've only ever launched them solo. I find the process fun, there's a variety of things to do, enough challenging enemies and a decent amount of loot from doing it. I just buy up launch cards when I see them in player vendors (I hate hunting those drones) and if a server hasn't launched one, I'll pop into one of the silos and go through it. Even if you don't do it regularly, I'd recommend launching once from each silo for the experience. It's totally doable solo, though you want to start at Alpha as the enemies are easier. A few tips, always bring two launch cards in case you make a typo, go to nukacrypt.com directly, don't just google as that often brings up old codes, have a ranged weapon (even if you're melee) for turrets and hacking perks will allow you to get the robots to fight each other at certain points. You also need power armor or a rad suit for a section of it. If you're going for the queen, look up the best locations to do and make sure there are enough high level players to take her down. There's nothing worse than going through the whole silo and failing to take down the queen.
---
Do you have it set for Fullscreen or Fullscreen Windowed?
---
Oh that ones easy all they had to do was [REDACTED]
---
You're asking if the frame problem is common on this game of all games?
---
health bar
---
There is nothing trivial about that stash box and its only gna get worse for everthing else sure its preety minor but it reaches a point where some people stop and go this is gettin bad which is what most people i played with did for u they might be trivial to some1 who spends all day fighting there inventory its not then again i only play with 1 person whos ever bought microtransactions so maybe im in the minority
---
Exactly this.
---
Having said that, they should do something for ending it early. They won't, but they should.
---
But hey, armor always takes damage now again. Please buy more repair kits.
---
Cause Radroaches got a buff
---
Yes its my fault 20 points
---
Pretty much.  The novelty is fun, but then you realize you are denying others the opportunity to get their hits in.  There's just no need.  At some point, as long as you're around, the Queen *is* going to die.  Whether it's 2 minutes or 12.
---
Tbh that's probably the best I've heard so far xD
---
frustrating is putting it mildly.
---
and i thought i was the only one!!!
---
Lol. Found so much stuff just laying around at almost every camp I went to.
---
People didn't even care if I grabbed a few dozen things.
---
Asylum inmates go through crazy effort, too....
---
They didn't have as much content at release and people complained about the game being bare. I'll agree that comparing the two game's content is lopsided as ESO has had four years to add content. That's why I'm comparing the cash shops, ESO is much more predatory
---
My freind has the sub hes able to use those
---
Mama Dolce's is great for the flux you can't get at the bog or Whitesprings. There are tons of plants all over and a passable amount of ghouls show up, especially if you can time it with Back on the Beat or the quest at the airport with the aid drops. Plus the train station if you leave it out of the nuke zone has a chem workbench which allows you to make the flux right away.
---
You mean, are they moving away from major story expansions that could classify as a new game entry in some respects as to the other literal three fourths of DLCs be it dungeons or zones they come out with? No, because the promise was Chapter, two dungeons, and a DLC zone. Not what you're going on about. If you'd payed attention when they said DLC was free, you'd have noticed that Chapters weren't included in that from the start, seeing as they are major game expansions along the lines of what you get with WoW.
---
Yeah, a rather liked not having to deal with it for a couple weeks...
---
Bffr25 less vats cost handmade is the most valuable and while faster reload may suit u and ur purposes u could trade that bffr25 for a bffrfr and some extra stuff on the side
---
Got ya...I would say go play on XBOX then...I can just click and message...easy peasy....
---
I finished all the vault raids and got all the rewards my self my advise is us quad explosive or two shoot explosive.
---
Less vats cost prolly best
---
Could be worse, you could've gotten the paddle ball
---
I got two sneak builds and dont use the sneak perk for either of them because i think its bugged. First time I threw the perk on outside wes tek I got detected immediately after not being detected like that with just escape artist. I use either Uny or Weightless armor for both characters. I lose my enemies whenever I crouch. If I were you, I would drop the sneak perk, it fucks everything up imo.
---
I'm sure statistics indicated many people weren't using it, so it's not a priority.
---
A bloodied ffr vats cost handmade is (imo) the best weapon in the game, drops scorchbeasts and mirelurk queens in just a second. If you look up "Captainoob" on Youtube he tested it solo on the sb queen... Dont ever trade away that weapon unless you dont want it.
---
It took me almost 2 months of battlebot......warning.
---
Nah, never cared to get past the grind or errors in the game. Ended around level 30 maybe? Game isn't balanced for starting out solo players and it was just empty and shitty. That being said I love the constant bullshit they pull so I'm here to watch. Making everyone get close then yanking awards off? Classic
---
Not I. Never really figured what the deal of it was about.
---
you really thought you were clever writing this
---
Heck, just combining certain perks together to make them better would be great. Combining things like butchers bounty, green thumb, and woodchucker to get double would be a nice perk.
---
I found a red dump truck in the Ash Heap with 2000+ Cleavers in the back and I was astounded. So much lag and noise lol.
---
I would definitely try out a mode like this if it ever exists.
---
Perk cards are a little worrying to me because they can make people almost undefeatable. Letting people choose a perk loadout from a limited set of perk cards similar to NW before joining the mode would be ok with me.
---
Starting at Vault 76 with temporarily disabled PvP seems like it could be abused, so I propose to let the game randomly choose a location to spawn on with PvP already on like I believe DayZ does.
---
Also, can't forget to disable PvP VATS for obvious reasons.
---
So they would have suites in their stadium?
---
not to mention their team would keep scoring in the wrong endzone
---
Honestly i never did any of these events.  Idk what rewards you could get from it but i  guess it  was  cosmetic stuff which i dont give much value to it. I understand that it sucks for some to miss out on them but there will be other events in the future with their own unique rewards.  I'd rather have  unique weapons or armor as reward.
---
When they first announced DLC would be free, there weren't any chapters to exclude. If you take away the name chapters then it's just downloadable content. Chapters weren't planned from the start or at least unmentioned when making the dlc promise
---
Zero launches here.
---
Not sure why you all are so annoyed with this FO1st thing...I don't have it and won't get it but damn just play the game. If it bugs you so much that it you can't have it, save up or go play another game ffs.
---
I'm level 65 . Idk how to do it. I found all the codes and couldn't figure it out. I would like to do it so I can get that stupid quest off my thing keeps popping up.
---
Lol. Comment under rated.
---
Yes, but I haven't been able to see how much Gun-Fu is doing in regards to damage.
---
If you use it 1 meter from your targets it works, otherwise the damage is low, got a 2 barrell  Instigating/Explosive and another one Bloodied/Explosive, both waiting in stash for a buff.
---
Yep. Any time it lagged bad, I knew I was close to someone duping. So snoop around and bam - unlimited resources.
---
I've never launched. One. I'm level 90 something and have owned the game since launch.
---
So that’s why there’s sometimes a random core in my stash
---
What are you, a ghoul?
---
Ok there Reed Richards
---
Nope, never. Played casually on and off since launch and after I found how to launch no nukes in month 1 of playing I just stopped caring to try
---
NFL teams already do something similar to what you described... seat licenses.
---
Yes, why should I complain if I am dissatisfied with a product, right? Pay Bethesda and forget, right?
---
I used to do queen and whitespring nukes quite often, but now I just nuke peoples camps at random and try to nail them
---
Feel better now?
---
Level 79 Never Launched One
---
I’m level 670 and I’ve only launched 2 nukes
---
BERSERKER and aa
---
Like I said, just play another game. Your money speaks louder than your words
---
I'm an engineer. You get things done as soon and as efficiently as possible to avoid procrastination. That is my opinion and yours may be different. You make time. I myself was swamped with fitness, work, art commission work, other games to play, shows to watch, a girlfriend to attend to, and plenty more and I found it incredibly easy to unlock in the time I set aside. Sorry for the harshness but it is a reward. If you wanted it bad enough you would have planned better.
---
Edit: love the hate guys, keep it up! It is an exploit, highly doubt BGS intended to have a Meathook smash things that hard, really just an oversight on what stacks perk wise and how many stacks you get get on just 1 weapon...add food, drugs, bobble head, and may/comic....upwards of 10K damage was nowhere near intended.
---
It would, if they gave me my money back. Since I have already paid for 76, not playing it sends zero message to Bethesda.
---
There go to should be free to play.
---
no radaway but that doesn't usually affect. i know to use diluted rad x i usually sell regular radx
---
I have not launched a nuke yet. It's the only quest I have not completed. (lvl 92, played since launch)
---
Ive lauched 2 if you want to do one clear a few hours go to the whitespring bunker and get your cipher keys and pad and pencil ready.
---
ive launched about 10
---
Yes, load bearing and also breach and clear are supposed potential drops
---
Faster Fire rate handmade is my main gun on commando build.
---
I launched my first one the other day at level 60, game promptly crashed after I left the bunker.
---
They're not using it because it's broken, like the logic behind this thought process.
---
98 here, casually playing since stress tests, never launched a nuke
---
I got the best tio for new comers. Throw the game in the trash
---
Was on a normal server though not private. Might worth trying anyway though thanks.
---
You could probably run 76 on the dreamcast at 120fps
---
Its the smaller update between the big ones.
---
More like    
---
60€ for ticket. With that ticket you get seat but there is no game happening (Not enough content) and with 100€ more you get ticket to VIP booth. In that booth there is no difference to normal seats but with 12€ extra you can buy warm soda and cold hotdog for 8€, and those super cool stuff are only for VIP quests.   
---
Issues are that there is no game. Bethesda promised the players would come in autumn but then delayed that into next year so they can sell you VIP benches (which still are just normal benches, zero difference) and when those players finally arrives, only VIP spectators can see them because that was their plan all along. Too bad when players finally arrived to stadion, they realized every spectator has left their stupid baseball game for next door football game that is as good as the baseball games used to be... when the football game team played in the baseball team. #sorry_not_sorry
---
Uninstalling Fallout 76 usually fixes all its problems, except the gaping holes in your wallet and soul.
---
I’ve only ever launched one and I’ve never taken the time to really learn the order of events to run a silo effectively.
---
That being said, if anyone is on PS4 and drops nukes regularly hit me up, I need to farm radiation fluids and wouldn’t mind learning the silos.
---
Level 290 and launched probably 300 nukes. I usually do 3 every night at least. Some nights we do multiple server runs. When the clean up Appalachia event was going on it was common for 10+ nukes a night.
---
If your weapon has that prefix, you'll need to crouch to reload, or the 250 will break the primary prefix until the weapon is switched out and re equipped .
---
I haven't.  
---
I actually found someone who randomly added me to his group and clumsily said "Nuke" several times! I was excited. We went through, doing a few things AND THEN HE GOT DISCONNECTED, never came back.
---
This is why I propose a max level of 50, with only 50 levels, you can only spec yourself a certain way, and you can’t be flexible! People won’t be as invincible as you may think, as taking legendaries out of the equation is taking out the more OTT parts of the game, i don’t think any of the perks would be too op, Blooided, Junkies etc wouldn’t exist like they do in adventure! 
---
Spawning didn’t seem to see an issue for new characters in survival mode, there level 5 cap made it so they couldn’t get grief and couldn’t do too much to gain without passing level 5, so I think this system could work, but I see thee potential for abusing, so let’s talk about your next point dayz works fairly similar but I guess a bit better, Dayz will currently spawn you in a random part of the map, but in a set lower level area where the loot is considerably worse than if they wondered further into the map, but you have a kinda security spawning in dayz as the area is still prettt large, so as to how spawning in would go, testing would defiantly have to be done to find the perfect option, my idea just an adjustment of how the game already handles leaving the vault!
---
Damn, that's bad. Thanks for letting me know, I had no idea!
---
Voted
---
I would say a full set of unyielding armor might give too much advantage with the constant +15 points to all attributes except endurance. And it will also make the "skill checks" coming with Wastelanders trivial to pass. So, I would consider ideas like changing how multiple pieces stack, or making the effect temporary once per minute.
---
In general, the issue is usually not with a single weapon or effect being overpowered, but rather with how multiple ones stack or synergize. Especially multiplicative damage buffs, and damage reductions by a percentage.
---
Once you run it a few times with a decent team the timer isn’t so bad on some of the missions. Week 1’s mission (which is the current one once the reset finishes) is arguably the easiest one to do on standard, and can be completed with 5-10 minutes still left on the clock
---
I add scars every time I die. Started from the beta baby faced, now my level 230 has a face even his mother wouldn’t recognize
---
There’s no need to apologize man I’m not taking it harshly and o hope I’m not coming off that way either. I mean no offense, it is simply a difference of opinion but for me and what I’ve had going on I just couldn’t justify making 76 a priority at the time. I’m a college student and it was exam week. So carving out time for the game was the least of my worries especially when I knew there to b more time. I think my real problem is with them ending it early without admission or announcement and the fact is they didn’t start it any earlier then what I perceive to have been the starting time (addressing the good ole time zone argument) so why is it ending early! It’s just sad like I wouldn’t have minded if I didn’t get the rewards entirely of my own accord but this wasn’t entirely on me.
---
yeah but it's also a better game
---
If comments on this sub and the fo sub are to be believed, they are ny knicks or redskins.
---
Relying on past nostalgia to draw fans to the stadium while putting out a subpar performance.
---
Personally to me they are the ny giants or mabey la lakers.
---
Good for a championship every decade but in between these championships are alot of decisions that make you scratch your head.
---
Hrm I had forgotten about that.... I can defend eso because it improved beyond recognition after its horrible launch and had dev communication the entire way explaining what they knew they got wrong and where they were headed, and they still are. FO76 seems to be getting worse and with no Dev commentary on the horrible design decisions.
---
So all of us who still play are fucked? Awesome. Not only do I get bent over by Bethesda, but now I get bent over by people who made useful tools to play the game and take it away.
---
Level 140-something, playing since day one and I’ve never launched.  I keep saying I’m going to do it before wastelanders, we’ll see.
---
So you can scrap Enclave plasma guns to possibly learn the weapon mods?
---
Never launched one but, at the same time I just haven't even reached that part of the game. I'm at lvl 113 and I'm not allowed to launch a nuke yet. I've started the quest that leads up to launching the nuke but, I have to get to general lvl or something. Been working on that for a bit.
---
Right now it’s maintenance, no one can get on currently
---
Yeah, my face is gonna be all burned up
---
That isnt really applicable here. Yes they are independent probabilities but you're applying it wrong.  He isnt asking "If I just missed 4 shots what is the probability of missing the 5th"   If that was the case, the game had surgical scrub room level clean code and no perks or other variables yes it's exactly the same chance as the previous 4 shots, 10%. Thats because your previous 4 shots are known values, 100% chance you already missed. Hes asking "In 5 shots what are the chances that I miss all of them" 
---
Think about it like this. You have 5 fair six-sided dice. We'll say that rolling a 1 is missing a shot, about a 16% chance. Any other number is a hit. If you roll them all at the same time, what are the chances that every single die is a 1?  0.0129%. If any other combination is hitting the target, he has a 99.987% of hitting the target at least once.  And thats ignoring that the next event DOES have a concept of the previous event here, thats the premise of the concentrated fire perk, that successive shots become more accurate.
---
Fallout 76 goes for maintenence every Tuesday, thats why you cant loggin now... maintenence must be ending.
---
I’m lvl 118 and never launched a nuke, I got the achievement though when I was on a team with someone that did, I wasn’t even into silo lol
---
Servers are down for maintenance and a hotfix, should be able to login soon.
---
Servers are currently under maintenance for a hot fix.
---
Dude chill out if we want to use torches and pitchforks we can
---
I'll take a wild wasteland perk while they're at it, with oooeeeoooooo sound effect
---
Ok gen x
---
Lol we are being downvoted hard by Beth shills. Went from 12 to 4, and you are at -2.
---
All for saying how easy it was to dupe and how they took forever to fix the issue.
---
It’s just for an RP, I want my character to build their base near a place they would call home or be connected to.
---
It would also help telling us what specs your system has but the usual culprits are shadows and grass, turn both down.
---
If they had just made all the rewards available at once instead of unlocking them one day at a time it would’ve been better and given everyone a bit more time.
---
Ye, well. I know more people even myself to a degree was a little disappointed in the start since its not singelplayer ES, but, now Im actually glad theres a ES mmo as an option. You just have to apply and accept your mmo perpesctive to it. Which ofc not everybody can do.
---
Yeah if you're looking for a generic MMO. If you're looking for something that resembles other Elder Scrolls you're kinda SoL. As least this plays like a Bethesda Fallout game, minus the NPCs
---
Death is death is not viable in this game. I play DiD, but server issues, stability, immortal enemies, invisible damage... 
---
I want hardcore. But...
---
No gameplay changes were made for you. Its the same game you bought. You want more now though, more that others are willing to pay for yet you yourself are not. If you want it, buy it like the rest of us, if not keep playing your game as is, since it is still the same game.
---
Dude calm down have some fun it’s just a joke you SJWS

What’s wrong with something like a wooden mask? Or do you mean the overpowered weapons?
---
Thanks a lot! I play since beta, but always hated having to deal with perk builds. Too many ways to mess it up / *not have a perfect build*. 
---
You got me in the first half, saved your post to read the rest later. You summed it up very good imo!
---
Adding this to my Fallout76Custom.ini helped my 750ti and I reduced resolution by one click, still lokks ok and is smoother. Grass was hard on GPU, you could reduce the view distances in FO76 setting, drag sliders back to left and test.

I've launched 10 on console from level 25 - level 130.
---
None thus far on PC as I'm only level 12
---
thats not how this works...
---
What a nice friend. That’s a 75k gun.
---
No gameplay changes were made for you. Its the same game you bought. You want more now though, more that others are willing to pay for yet you yourself are not. If you want it, buy it like the rest of us, if not keep playing your game as is, since it is still the same game. Me having unlimited scrap doesn't affect you in any way.
---
Go away, grow up and play something you enjoy, why are you still here?
---
I've tried launching a nuke multiple times, but the game was always too buggy to let me complete it.
---
Either the game crashed, or multiple times one of the force field doorways which was supposed to open up at a certain point never did, so I couldn't proceed.
---
I understand your concern with how broken the game is, a Hardcore would be extremely jarring when the majority of the time you die to the game and not the players/world!
---
Yes. They rank members based upon damage output and silo times. There are typically 20 plus members at a time in a public server. The goal is 3 queens in under an hour,  rinse and repeat,  24/7
---
I especially noticed this on the forward base by the steakhouse. Killed 7 or 8 there. Just constantly respawning after each kill.
---
Level 60, not quite to the level of everyone else here. I play solo, I don't have any friends who play 76 on Xbox, so I tried to get through the silo by myself (twice). I ended up going through all my stims, almost all my food, and nearly all of my ammo. I haven't tried to raid it again and I don't plan on doing it solo. In short I haven't done it because the game isn't very solo-friendly imo so the silo is hard as shit.
---
Oh! Sorry folks for this, but thanks for the reminder. I havn't played for quite a while!
---
"Hey kid, you got any ~s u g a r~?"
---
Yes, but it is not the best way to spend your points.
---
You've purchased the meal, eaten the meal and are dissatisfied with it and now want your money back. Sounds a bit ridiculous to me. Buying a bad game is a risk we as gamers all take
---
Unfortunately he most likely didn't even want the workshop. Based on some people I know that pvp and no longer have survival servers to get their dosage a majority of those players target high value workshops to attack like the munitions factory because they know those who own it will most likely fight them to keep it, so they get off killing them a couple times.
---
how long is it usually down for?
---
Yep.
---
And this did not go away. The recipe is still there.
---
Me too, but played since release day, and it's still fun and still f**** the server last night 🤣🤣👍🏼
---
I've come to terms with the fact that every opinion I have will be downvoted for no reason here tbh.
---
Isn't it the last main quest?
---
I used to launch nukes just because i would get 10 levels per run and everything respawned.
---
Why are you even here?
---
What where the items removed, anyone know?
---
awesome good to know it's still working
---
Wait till you notice the seams ;)
---
Solid advice. Also whens maintenance end?
---
If it's not in the game (yet) then it needs to be removed. I mean everything that came from the dev room
---
It's a bit unusual.  Typically, the Launcher will flag the game as under maintenance and prevent you from launching it.  This time, I've got a green check and can launch, but I get this error instead.
---
This makes too much logical sense, it will never happen.
---
Yep yep, it's been around for months..wish they'd get around to fixing it
---
Game would probably be unplayable with lag.
---
But the thing is it's not even really Elder Scrolls. Not even a good skin of it imo. Most of the dialogue is nothing like Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim. It seemed more modern from what I played
---
"We do this because we don't allow the Dev team to touch the thermostat as we're hemorrhaging their budget to the point where there are about 7 people employed there so we can better please investors."
---
Funny you say that because I have friends that think ESO was cobbled together in the Hero Engine for a quick buck, and that it would be 100% better if it played like skyrim but with multiplayer. You know - the way 76 feels like fallout 4 with other people, and not a wow clone with a fallout skin.
---
Opinions on same but Fixer?
---
Sometimes when I go kill the Queen with others the color of the terrain, the yellow Nukezone, and the horrible lagging gives me a horrible headache and makes me lightheaded. Anyone else?
---
Why? It’s literally harmless fun having my wooden mask and to run around and scream in game chat ooga chakka
---
gtx 970, i5 4690, 24 gb ddr3 ram. I have shadows on medium
---
I've resorted to staring at the ground for a min or so after joining a server.  it helps but it's still a crapshoot
---
bffr lvc handmade is the ultimate gun. suspicious how there's thousands of them in circulation on ps4 but whatever, just buy one and you won't need anything else
---
Educated guess, is all server side.
---
Nothing significant has changed client-side since the last hotfix.
---
I guess the lengthy process is due to the scrubbing of the databases of all the naughty stuff that was in circulation.
---
Im not rich enough to get my hands on one and test it for myself... 😂
---
&gt; It’s been a name and nothing else
---
Along with the screenshots the other user posted, [here's the trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2XdwS4lcZM)
---
Not everyone has the same amount of luxury time to grind
---
Here come Todd Howard's harem.
---
Because I believe that if it's not obtainable legitimately then it shouldn't be in game, and obviously they do, too, since they're removing items people got from the dev room
---
Level 93. 
---
I’ll get around to it someday. 
---
Look, I’m a busy guy okay? 
---
Someone has to exterminate all those rad roaches.
---
I wouldn't expect any data miners to help anymore, considering the bs that has recently taken place.
---
Looks like a few people don't want anybody to know about this issue we're discussing here.
---
30min even with major updates. Now minor few little bug fixes takes over 2h. I wonder why it suddenly takes ages to get back online
---
I was in my private server but joining on a friend/mule works. What I was testing was whether one of us leaving and coming back would respawn them and it did. And not just in my area but seemed to all over WS.
---
Nah, its just their PR team and white knights downvoting things so as few people as possible know about it.
---
The game is perfect! There is nothing to see here! Move along!
---
I have launched 3 over 2 characters. My first nuke was on my main character (now lvl 167) when I was around level 100, my second character is lvl 68 and done the run twice.
---
You must not do that much stealth. I and many other have noticed it on a regular basis. I run a full stealth build, can use a stealth boy 3, sneak bobble head, run full stealth armor and still go from hidden to danger for no reason and have enemies run right to my location from far away while sitting still and crouching. It's a mess.
---
2000 = Digital Collectors Edition missing
---
2008 = Fallout 1st Subscription Missing
---
They've adapted.  
---
All hope is lost.
---
&gt; at least they were smart enough to make their camp in a mine. 
---
A uranium mine.  You think that's smart?
---
(Why do you think Rose was a farmhand?)
---
the shit with harpers is that u need to check if there are mutis or ghouls before nuke there. ghouls good, mutis not
---
In other MMOs, even if they can't actually help you for one reason or another, they'll at least talk to you. They'll say that they couldn't help you and are escalating it, or that its a known bug and its being worked on, or at the very least explain that they couldn't recreate the bug and ask for more details, or to contact again if it continues to happen.
---
How customer service behaves with you is what makes all the difference, even if the answer ends up being the same.  "I can't help with that, and here's exactly why." is so much better than "I can't help." and closing the ticket.
---
Clever girl.
---
I really dont believe a word that Bethesda says
---
Hey dude, sorry I didn’t reply sooner. I didn’t get the notification. 
---
About pictures, I can’t send any as I uninstalled the game shortly after buying the outfit. I was waiting for the Halloween event to see if I would keep waiting for the game to get better and honestly the event was boring and I spent a fair chuck of atoms on the outfit so I uninstalled the game the same day I think. Sorry to disappoint.
---
BDCG, DCs, me mug
---
I can imagine rows of our vending machines in the dance hall, full of players buying and selling and our camps separate.
---
Server maintenance is currently going. It will be fine once that is complete. 
---
Check here for updates on the maintenance 
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/372510/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-november-12-2019?language%5B%5D=en
---
level 138, barely done any quests, never done a nuke or been in the silo, not done any raids. closest I've got to end game content is helping kill the queen and going on legendary farming runs.
---
I walk around with a bffr fixer, bffr lvc handmade, bffr tesla and a bffr combat rifle and run bloodied commando, spent alot of my time trading so I suppose I'm ready to go to the top of the world and kill 3 molerats or whatever crap the quests are
---
because how else will they let people know about the lord and saviour radioactive jesus?
---
maintenance now
---
Servers are down for maintenance:

---
I can't post links. But do a google search of nukacrypt. They post the codes up every week about an hour or two after reset. 
---
If you want to decode the code yourself there are also guides online to help with that.
---
Level 150 and up until a fee months ago never had any interest in launching nukes then i went in exploring the silo and every once in a while i find decent loot. plus i enjoy setting up the queen fight for everyone. I'm one of the people that Carry's a bunch of ammo and give as much as i can to whoever needs it for the fight. since I primarily use heavy guns other then selling it. 99%of the ammo i encounter is useless to me.
---
Seriously?
---
The game is in maintenance right now.  How desperate are you to score points for your tribe?
---
stop helping those weak ass people and get some fun
---
Why would you want yo play a game that you think is terrible?
---
I lol'd
---
Go grab the Can chimes at Camden Park and Crevasse Dam
---
Then what harm am I actually doing then? Having one item, and that being a wooden mask, it doesn’t ruin pvp unlike a BE Gatling plasma, and lets say the item then gets added into the game with the next hot fix let’s say, would you then go back on your statement and say, “it’s fine to own one now”, I really don’t see the harm in owning someone neat like the wooden mask
---
hyperbole gets downvoted.
---
Boring cliché is boring, get a F\*\*\*\*ing life mate.
---
Haha, that's a great idea
---
Have never had a crash on mine, day one sub.
---
then they better give people who DID grind it out and successfully get  reward alot more than 500 atoms, as it wouldnt be fair to them if then just anyone can buy the rewards
---
lvl 130, did it twice just cause, thats it.  I really enjoyed it tho, had a uncomplicated run and was prepared. Queen was ok.
---
I recommend anyone who havent done it to try.
---
:-)
---
Run 2 ps4s simultaneously on 2 separate accounts, been running 10 to 15 battle bots daily for about a month now....no plans even with 2 accounts putting hours in to finding it. By far the rarest item in the game....ugh.
---
Reduce your graphic overhead. Lower resolution, textures and/or shadows until you get better fps. There are many .ini tweaks online to help get more out of the game.
---
Depends how long it takes for bethesda to admit they were wrong with FO1st, refund those who bought the annual scrip, and make unlimited scrap storage part of the base game like it should have been.
---
it doesn't happen upon login for me only but can happen mid play session and also not just food either but I've been disconnected taking a disease cure. came back to find it used up and me still diseased.  .... -_-
---
Try un equipping the card and re equipping
---
That's what makes statistics so magical!
---
It’s always taken 3 hours except for patches where they prepaid assets such as the Halloween patch. 10 am EST is usually a pretty accurate estimate for maintenance to end.
---
I launched a nuke, needed to do it to get my scout badge.  Pioneer scouts are hardcore!
---
I did it once just in case Wastelanders starts from that specific point. Luckily, tons of people showed up to kill the queen. I was careful to leave Delta untouched, and we fought her rad free.
---
thank youu i didnt realize that was the message it gives for maintenance lol
---
I'm not gonna back out of my statement and opinion. If it's not obtainable legitimately in game, no matter what it is, then no one should have it. You're not gonna change my mind. If it was obtainable legitimately in game, it wouldn't be an issue. Obviously if they make any dev room items obtainable legitimately in game, then it won't be a problem because now you can actually get it without cheating or using an exploit.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but there is nothing to datamine since there is no new game file updates? Just server side adjustments which we cannot really see what they do on their end?
---
Getting same thing don’t worry haha
---
It doesn't completely suppress them, only a fresh serum will do that for an hour.
---
No it did not, you don't know what you are talking about.
---
Fallout 1st allows you to transfer items between your toons
---
Everyone’s desperate to point out the next problem with Fallout 76. I swear the trolls that lurk around on this sub don’t even play the game but stick around to be toxic for some reason. It’s beyond me as to why.
---
enforcer is a must to handle those assaultron i combine shotgun build with melee. with a +30% damages to robots axe, i can just run and hit them to one-shoot
---
I love my BDCG 😢only play PVE and don't use it often but good to kill sheep 👍
---
Football 1st membership sounds like a bargin.
---
Lol yeah, I had a mini what the hell moment lol
---
I happen to run a stealth pistol and shotgunner as my alt.  A full set of Unyielding Shrouded Wood Armor and very high Agility means I can crouch right in front of a Super Mutant without it seeing me, even without the Sneak perk equipped.  Like many, I can also hide-in-plain-sight from the Queen in melee.
---
I will grant that when I fire the first shot, enemies are awakened and tend to drift toward my position despite not "knowing" I'm actually there.  Some wake up seemingly based on proximity rather than doing anything (Camden Park Scorched, for example).  But by and large, I manage to remain in \[Caution\].
---
What resources are you talking about? Only takes a small amount of materials to repair mainframe cores. 
---
Ammo consumption is optional.
---
yep. others are stating anything pip-boy related can trip it
---
Wha? How?
---
&gt; I guess the lengthy process is due to the scrubbing of the databases of all the naughty stuff that was in circulation.
---
This they can do, but coincidentally can't restore anything that ended up lost from ones stash or inventory due to a bug.  
---
&gt; wE dOn'T hAvE tHe ToOlS fOr ThAt.

&gt; Warm regards

and shearing em
---
datamining=/=exploiting with cheat engine
---
&gt; Or a feature to stop me from playing this terrible game? 
---
That's a pretty ironic comment, oh well, whatever 🤷‍♂️
---
Encryptied is the one where Calvin van Lowe is even kinkier than normal.
---
I haven't yet. I will at some point soon but I'm not in a rush. Only level 73 compared to you tho.
---
It means that the servera are up and they are being tested.
---
Only accounts with the 'required entitlements' can log in during the test phase.
---
363 and nuke anywhere up to 6 times a night.  Mostly queen fights but I have other areas I nuke for certain flora.  Sometimes just for fun.  Unless you are an player that is harassing the crap put of low levels. Then the nuke hits a house.  But I do it out of boredom
---
How long are usually they down
---
Check the Whitespring bunker, the vendors have mods for the enclave related items, scout armor, plasma, etc.
---
Fair. I was under the impression that The Fixer was the best semi-auto in the game, thus a Fixer with those would be the “God Drop” of Rifles.
---
And yet what happened, happened...
---
Lvl 114 but not played properly since Feb!! Had launched many nukes back then
---
Pick fights with scorchbeasts. You don't have to kill them, but every one will draw a sizeable mob that should drop plenty of mats for stable crafting. Just make sure all the action is in the nuked zone.
---
Lvl 135 and never have, got close once, but got overwhelmed by enemies and gave up lol
---
Where is there a Stat boosting pet in ESO?
---
Then you should have changed your game play. If you acknowledged the most efficient strategy to have earned the reward then still continued to play aggressively then that is your choice. It may not be a fun fast paced grind but it is by all means a light grind. And it was in their time zone...
---
Because that *is* the game for them.
---
I just hit 100 and i havent fired one just cant be arsed to
---
The passage of time did more damage to him then you ever could
---
What exactly do you mean? Are you referring to the game overall? Or items in game?
---
Bro I’m not asking you to change your opinion 😂 I’m just asking what harm I’m doing with a wooden mask THAT I GOT FROM A VENDOR FOR 2k IM NOT SAYING CHANGE UR OPINION BRO i just want to know what your reasoning for not wanting these in game is, I get it’s your opinion, but why is it that you don’t want these in game? Does it make the server lag? Do you just plain out not want items non obtainable in game? I just want to hear your reasoning
---
Eso launched with the need of having eso plus. You had to pay to play when it first came out. Day 1 user here.
---
They just introduced the first one, a boar which increases your inventory slots. I consider inventory space a stat. People have already asked for more, so probably will be in the future
---
Not even "God drop" it would be the rifle to end all rifles
---
Bruh lmao I literally don't need a reason, it's just my opinion. Deal with it
---
You can get the weekly launch codes from nukacrypt.com. all you need is a nuclear keycard and you're good to go
---
Sorry to burst your bubble but there were a lot of casual players who had been working on this since day one. Me included. And it didn’t help that your XP started at zero whenever a new cosmetic was unlocked. Also don’t recall a single time where an event was cut up to 12 hours early but okay.
---
I waited a long time to launch my first nuke. Once I did I was hooked. Now I farm to stabilize flux. I'll launch in the middle of no where just because I'm after one kind of flux.
---
Just make sure your on private server put item into any container (mailbox suitcase) quit out switch toons it will return you to same private server retrieve items. This was working before maintenance today haven’t checked to see if still works. Just to be safe try transferring something cheap
---
Level 290 and 102 characters, never launched. I've helped in Silos and go to tons of Queen fights.
---
I run stealth and can have enemies right up next to me and they won’t see me. Is it the same issue with and without the Stealth Boy? I’ve heard those can be glitchy with the AI.
---
DEATH IS A PREFERABLE ALTERNATIVE TO COMMUNISM!
---
An FPS limiter might help, but make sure it actually limits how many frames your GPU renders. I've heard V-Sync and RTSS picks frames that the GUP already rendered to show instead of limiting how many frames your GPU renders.
---
It has the highest DPS, but lower max magazine size and I feel it doesn't control as well ADS or hip fire.  So kind of a trade-off depending on play style
---
I'm a whitespring golf course camper I have been since discovering it during beta. It would be nice but I think they'd rather people find new locations and spread out so I've just understood I'm gonna have to deal with it or move.
---
he fucked with cheat engine he got banned
---
theres nothing else to add
---
bethesda has no bug bounty program so he should have known fully well the consequences of his actions
---
10 am EST is usually when it *begins*. ;)
---
You're right though, 3 hours is pretty typical now.
---
No he purchased the meal, ate the meal, enjoyed the meal, then a year later they now offer an additional side with the meal so he wants his money back
---
The private server gets held for you for somewhere between 10-15 minutes, so you can log off to the main menu and switch characters, or just log back in and force a respawn. It's great for moving equipment between characters without needing a friend.
---
Any idea as to how long the game will be down??
---
Sounds about right to me
---
You must have a special build of the game. The game I play has a random on/off switch when it wants stealth to work. Sometimes it's okay and then it's like no stealth at all. I use to go from hidden to danger because I switched my weapons, I reported it, Bethesda acknowledged it after a month and then it took Bethesda months to fix it. The last patch seems to have brought it back where it happens 50% of the time now. It's hot garbage at best. I also know people who "have no problem with stealth" , but they rarely ever really stealth the game.
---
I wonder which items got removed. O.o
---
God I can feel your entitlement from across the internet, I just wanted a reason as to why, and I can see why, the only reason is to bait me into talking to you right? Because it’s to troll me or something, got my answer from just simply working it out, won’t need to respond now, I’ll just get downvoted by a bunch of redditards who won’t pipe up themselves 😂
---
125 and no nuke for me. But I was on a team with a guy when he launched a nuke so I got the trophy for it but I haven’t done a run myself.
---
Good idea, I hadn’t thought of that.
---
**The Good:** Speccing out and gearing up the perfect build is very rewarding.  
---
**The Bad:** The game's gunplay and enemy AI design are lackluster.  
---
**The Ugly:** Endgame activities are "associate game designer" levels of bad.
---
RIP Bottle Cap mines, again.
---
It is... more nuanced than that.
---
Restoring individual items is a ballache, it would require looking at every individual case with great attention and 'nobody's got time for dat'.
---
Rolling back is a more sensible approach but still requires attention lest it gets exploited - possible example, asking repeatedly to get rolled back after finishing The Missing Link and not getting the coveted Raider Armour plans - and would require training the support staff on safely using proprietary tools lest they mess things up royally.
---
Giving people perfectly valid reasons regarding the matter is not guaranteed to satisfy them so 'we cannot do that' is short and to the point.
---
Is not great, but is not just a 'fuck off, we don't wanna'.
---
is this any different than the post in Hot?
---
Rambo you are wrong. End of the story. Get out of here now.
---
You...you're the one who responded to me, dude. You're the one who popped in asking why, I've been telling you why. I just don't think they should be in game. No one baited you, so quit acting like a damn victim
---
Maybe the way you spend your points is shit, like your opinion 🤔
---
Wait, are you saying having one piece of each modified works together and is more effective than a full set of shrouded wood?
---
If thats the case do you know why? Is it a case of diminishing returns? You mentioned chameleon stacking with itself being useful which is why I'm asking.
---
Dumb question but (new player to FO76) What is flux and what is it used for?
---
Can't speak for anyone else...but I'm just in awe that there's still loyal supporters for this game. They punish loyal players, those of you that stuck with them. I almost feel bad, but it's y'all that allow them to do it.
---
I've only launched one to complete the quest, get the trophy and say I've done it. I piggyback off of other people's nukes for flora/fighting SQB these days.
---
Nope.
---
So.... the game is "terrible".... yet you are still trying to play it....
---
&gt; Exploit: Removed a number of items that were not intended to be available in-game that could only be obtained by abusing an exploit.  
---
  
---
Color me intrigued. Wonder which ones.
---
This is a good tip! Reminds me I need to finish those challenges.
---
I have two characters about lvl 145 and neither has launched a nuke yet.  I will before Wastelanders arrives.
---
I’ve been trying to get some decent gear.
---
It should be like that. Pistols are sidearms. I love them and have no problem with them being weaker than rifles. 
---
In fact, gunslinger builds allow for dual builds. You can be the greatest cowboy and also a beast with an axe.
---
Ammo and whT not
---
If you rejoin your private session after leaving relatively quickly (I want to say within 10 minutes) you're taking back to the same world even if you switched characters. After reading this, I experimented a few times with stuff I wouldn't mind losing, then ended up transferring a ton of valuable stuff between characters. Like, 10s of thousands of caps worth of stuff. Legendaries, ammo, outfits. No problem. I just stashed what I wanted to move in a container, quit the world and rejoined as another character. So much quicker and more convenient than hiring a courier or bothering a friend.
---
Only on reddit is someone's opinion treated as hyperbolic because others don't agree with it.
---
670? Jesus... Nice job!
---
Not bursting any bubbles here kid! Just my opinion in the loop, I dont care for nuclear winter or any of those rewards so I have 0 hold for the matter. Sorry it happened to you and not to burst you or anyone elses bubble but I had friends do those challenges in a matter of a few hours of grinding. Not trying to pick a fight with you or anything and there really isn't an excuse for them closing the event
---
The good- Player vending, love it!
---
The bad- making explosive energy weapons legacy, I wish they still dropped!
---
The ugly- gotta be snallygasters! 🤮
---
Nah I’m just joking I doubled the numbers and commented
---
Plants that are harvested in a nuke zone give you different colors of Unstable Flux. You combine this in a chemistry workbench with Hardened Mass, High Radiation Fluids and Glowing Mass that you get from killing enemies in a nuke zone to give you Stable Flux.  You use the flux to make high end gear and ammo like the radiation shower, ultracite power armor and ultracite ammo for weapons with the prime receiver.
---
Idk i just seen that an earlier post had been removed so i put it up :/
---
Dude... Is everything alright at home?
---
Glitches, the bugs and that they aren’t able to make this game stable a year after release.
---
The person who presses that button must have been iced in. Texas is having a moment today. I'm kind of surprised they didn't push it to Thursday given the chances that Austin office is missing half its staff today and tomorrow.
---
No, I'm not sure
---
K thanks
---
I mean, I don't think its that tbh. Much like the direction of this game, the playerbase is so divided and spiteful towards each other for no reason
---
Everything has already been nerfed to death, my melee build and weapon has been the same unchanged for 6 months, back then I used to 1 hit level 62 ghouls, a patch later this became 2 hits and now it's 3 hits.
---
Yeah, I tend to get it when I Inspect and try to use one of the many freakin' Repair Kits I get from the Queen.  It's bad because I often won't think about this until I'm crouched at V9, ready to go, and I realize my Meat Hook needs repair.  Go to repair... crash.
---
Sort of why that armor decay bug was nice.  One less thing that needed repair.
---
Because a couple of them are really rare to find. Specifically Red. I would say the next two rarest to find would be Forest and Yellow.
---
If you are on PC I would be happy to help you get this! As of today, I have helped 93 people launch their first Nukes and I am trying for my triple digit!
---
level 82 - never have, still dont know how to. Also wasn't able to figure out the backpack thing lol. I play completely solo though and have rarely looked up anything or watched youtube videos.
---
Good to know. That's how I play, so won't be bothering
---
The Good: The game world, in-game community, exploration, CAMPs, crafting and repair loop, non-linear main story quest structure, interesting lore, the Wild Appalachia updates was the closest we’ve gotten to a “golden days” of Fallout 76 imo
---
The Bad: The Legendary system (good for others, bad for my tastes), server instability, persistent bugs, lack of substantial updates that aren’t just new ways to farm legendaries, lack of impactful quests and repetitive quests
---
The Ugly: Bethesda’s apparent inability to update the game without breaking it, Bethesda’s monetization tactics (the monetizing in itself is not the issue, so please no “bUt LIvE sErVIcE GaMEs gOtTA bE MOnetIzEd”), Bethesda’s fluctuating levels of communication about changes and feedback, and last but not least the division the game itself has caused
---
Went to launch one once, fought through the silo with a high level friend, crashed at the last terminal, couldn't log in again for almost an hour because of some error lol, loaded in and traveled to my friend finally and got insta killed by radiation as the circle wasn't on the map. Just started playing again on ps4 so hopefully I will see another one launched one day lol.
---
Oh okay. So people are just running through fort defiance and hoping for those colours? All because they’re rare? Why are they rare and why are ppl paying so many caps
---
Mods are never going to happen.
---
I've launched about a half dozen and brought out the Queen each time, grinding for legendaries and plans.
---
Only the red one goes for that much. The others range in rarity from least to most rare according to the following: brown, green, blue, pink, yellow and forest. Then, of course, red.
---
I just traded a be handmade plus 20k 556 gor a AAE max and i love it, best killing machine next to my AAE plasma gatling. So i would say 70k
---
If I remember well the bug occurs when an aid item effect is about to expire but there is no remaining time displayed. If you consume the same kind of aid item, the game will crash. 
---
Now the root question is : why does the remaining time disapear with no reason? Time zone issue? Leap seconds?
---
Fair enough
---
Intelligence determines how much xp you get, and your unyielding armor is boosting your intelligence.
---
Yes I’ve launched a couple. Usually doesn’t happen unless I find a briefcase. If you do find one you have to communicate with your team so they can help get the codes, unless you’re able to get them all on your own. However, every time I’ve launched a nuke I have not used the sniffing perk even though people say it’s the best way to find a briefcase.
---
You sir deserve many many more upvotes!
---
To collect them becomes an addiction for some of us.
---
btw, pc of the Asylum Uniforms can go from 5 caps (whetered/White), to +30.000 caps (red).
---
some people just like collecting all the items and a few of the colors can be hard to get
---
Idk, better not be my items O.O ill turn into a moth
---
Rock on
---
Dad? is that you? 
---
I haven't seen you since Reclamation Day!
---
With 16 times the detail! Real canvas and beautiful frosted glass bottles!
---
I tried display settings changes - no better. I will let you know if todays maintenance helps or hurts.
---
Everything else on my xbox works fine and this game did since BETA. My problems started maybe a month ago when the PA problems started. The lag is much worse then ever. Can't melee fight without freeze and disconnect.
---
Any colour except dirty or weathered worth caps as they are technically rare some more so then others obviously lol.
---
White, brown, green are cheapest and most common of the 'colors'.
---
Then Blue, pink, yellow, forest and then Big Red. In order of rarity. You get the Red GG game over ask for what you like people will trade alot for it.
---
Make Explosive Bait. Scorchbeasts love to land at those, or get a Limb damage shotgun with Enforcer Perk.
---
Really i didn't know that very cool  thanks
---
That sunk cost fallacy!
---
Sounds legit. Thanks!
---
Really hope a certain unarmed weapon is unaffected by this
---
I wonder if it's as the other person said and your situation is being over-complicated with bobbleheads, Stealth Boys, etc.  I never use those types of perks.  For me, it's purely armor choice, suppressors, and relevant perk cards.  Because Unyielding pushes your Agility so high, I don't think you really *need* to run those consumable perks.  I'd try going without them and see how you fare.
---
Actually if you're doing a lot of server hopping and killing high lvl super mutants and ghouls that will lvl you up pretty fast. 
---
To further increase your xp gains, a lot of cooked foods can give you xp bonuses. So if you've started cooking a new food for your character lately check and see if it's boosting your xp. 
---
If you have been sleeping a lot in game recently compared to previously that will also boost your earned xp.
---
Okay cool
---
I never launched a nuke because I got motion sick from the framerate yo-yoing inside the bunker while we were trying to retrieve codes.
---
And after Beth's latest shenanigans, I don't plan to return to try.
---
Hope it still works it really does help. I try to switch as quick as possible not knowing if maybe there’s a time limit before itconnects to new server but the game did crash once so logged back on and it still returned to same server 😊
---
They're rare because the odds of them spawning is bad to terrible.
---
People pay because of rarity
---
Legitimately launching a nuke (I.e. collecting all pieces of a specific silo code before weekly reset, and then getting to the end of said silo to use code)? No
---
Hey now I'm an associate level developer and my stuff isn't that ba...  
---
\*looks up at my senior, refactoring my code\*  
---
Ok, yea lol
---
scout armor and yes legendary but nothing special that should interfere. i could give a break down 2night when i login
---
My bf and I have played since launch on PS4. We have launched probably 60+ nukes as a team. :)
---
That isn't fair
---
I have not but I usually go an play a different game before getting to do it
---
Mods will never come to fallout 76. How would that even work ?
---
Yeah I get why your frustrated about the time. My opinion is that they are not in the wrong but they could have made it a little more clear. For future reference this event should hopefully convince people to get the rewards as soon as possible XD
---
Yeah it outpaces my aaffr handmade in dps.
---
did this several times logged in and out as well. i logged in this morning to see if all was ok and it seemed to be until i had to remove and put armor back on.
---
With or without a stealth boy/sneak bobblehead. I only ran a stealth boy to test to see if it made a difference. That one glitch I mentioned before about switching weapons was confirmed by Bethesda. I still have videos of it on my Youtube page where I ran through the Whitsprings to show Bethesda, Example 1:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbdWL_UwFSY      Example 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaBRRCRmJU0     They fixed what you see above, but after the last patch it happens 50% of the time.
---
I take more issue with your accusation that "everyone did it."
---
I never even heard about it.
---
I've seen less plasma mines for sale...
---
bootlicker
---
It’s the white whale
---
It's exploiting the fact that the meat hook is broken and gets benefits from both unarmed and one handed perks.
---
That's why I asked?
---
All the colored outfits spawn in just one area of the asylum. There is a certain percentage chance for each color to spawn. Certain colors have a higher chance percentage than other colors. There is also a chance that no outfit spawns in the locations. 
---
Once a player takes an outfit that spot stays empty on the server until the server refreshes preventing any other players from finding an outfit on that server.
---
Nice. I was in a private server just before maintenance and was considering nuking WS.
---
You're probably just too stupid to realize the game is undergoing maintenance. That would be my guess
---
Once in awhile I can have enemies right next to me as well, then it's as if the entire area knows my location after doing absolutely nothing.
---
But then we'll be banned for reporting exploits haha
---
If I wanted to start farming these where would I go?
---
paintball gun
---
This is the correct behavior for the Berserker weapon: wearing armor == higher DR == lower damage from Berserker weapons (it's how they are supposed to work).
---
The AA weapon should be the same with or without armor, unless your armor has some kind of +SPECIAL legendary attribute which could boost damage (+Strength mainly for melee weapons). Some helmets/masks can have a -2 Perception hit, but can't think of any other armor that removes SPECIAL points when worn...
---
If you're running Adrenal Reaction your damage will vary depending on how low your health is, and food/chems can influence damage. Check what effects your toon is under the influence of when comparing stats.
---
Never. Not once.
---
Fort defiance
---
What do you think this is the sims
---
If I were to guess, Hunters Hood, Fasnacht Rare Masks, Wood Helmet, Laser Musket, Paintball Gun
---
Presh
---
I have been cooking glowing meat steaks for the 10% and i always sleep for that perk but mostly i eat razor grain soup. Thanks for the info
---
Lol I know it’s convinced me! 😅 and yes hopefully next time they will b more clear but I suspect this wasn’t intentional on their part and I just hope they do something as a consolation prize. I don’t need all the rewards but it’d b so sweet if I could just get the 3500 reward that I was like 100xp off of getting. My pumpkins skin would make it all ok lol
---
Collect and sell salt, pepper, cream, food that's close to expiring and alcohol to trade vendors, also if you have a good stock of  chems sell off the diluted ones you have.
---
Guess ill never buy games again then... 
---
Fuck video games for not being what i paid for
---
I want distressed wallpaper
---
I think Rust is the perfect model for survival mode, the game already has everything needed and it would bring a whole new side to the game :)
---
“Exploit: Removed a number of items that were not intended to be available in-game that could only be obtained by abusing an exploit.”
---
If it were up to me, this would be the highest priority for shit to fix. This is one of several absolute deal breakers for me when it comes to giving them any more money for anything.
---
ooh rabit holes, me likey.  thanks for the info about why.  I didn't know that
---
Unlimited scrap!  Wow that sounds... slightly useful if you're really lazy?  The glitch was for what... meat cleavers?  So you have all the steel and wood you could ever want... which you could otherwise get in infinite quantities just clearing west tek and scrapping rifles or clicking on logs.... big whoop.
---
I'm 90/91? Can't remember lol. Nope, never launched one, although I'm at the quest to do so and have multiple keycards. I mainly run around solo just blowing up cars as I love the mini nuke explosions!
---
I’m guessing the Fastnacht masks that never dropped during the event, but started showing up on trade forums recently.  That’s going to piss of a bunch of people if they remove them, but I guess it’s like having your Lamborghini repossessed after you bought it from a chop shop.
---
I so this too! Haha
---
Same here, lvl150
---
Players found a way to bring NW items in to adventure mode like single set NW marine armor and others
---
I think my precious gilded minigun is about to go “poof”.
---
"I've never been in a planecrash so planecrashes are fake."
---
Not wrong but still not right
---
Nuka dark premium rum
---
I left it open to interpretation intentionally.
---
I haven't launched a nuke in Fallout 76 and I'm level 111 and I think it's hard to do do and I'm on the Playstation 4
---
As a compromise, I would allow at most one PvE death per level. Also, if the mode is open PvP, then maybe as a "karma" mechanic, murdering another player's character would result in losing the extra life on the *next* level. Not a direct, immediate punishment, but it gives a reason not to just kill everyone on sight (or the player needs to live with the increased risk).
---
&gt; It would be nice, but I don’t think they’re fixing the strangler power armor/legacy plasma combo.  That’s likely what’s melting the queen in  seconds. 
---
Also melting the video cards of half the battle's participants. 🤣
---
Typically everything back up and running between 12-1 est (1 is 25 minutes from now). Can certainly run later, but that's a safe bet
---
How does 'fair' come into play? I is confused.
---
No customers are playing the game, is not another haves/have nots situation.
---
Only developer and QA accounts have those entitlements applied to them, no customer does.
---
Level 60 something, launched 1 1/2 nukes. I say half because I got snaked right at the last minute by someone using a stealthboy, I did all of the work, and they stole the nuke... second go around, launched it at white springs.
---
&gt; If it's not obtainable legitimately in game, no matter what it is, then no one should have it    
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;He gave you the reason are you ignorant or something?
---
At first I thought it was hard, but when I actually did it it turned out to not be so bad. I can run through it by myself relatively quickly.
---
Exactly my thought, I felt from before the game was announced that the game would fit so well into a dayz or rust style game! If they want to keep me invested for the next “Years” to come then this is something i need!
---
Oh my...you might have just discovered the true purpose of Vault 76.  Of course Vault Tec can't have an innocent vault aimed towards rebuilding.  The real test was human tolerance.
---
I bought most of my masks from vendors, it wouldn't be fair to remove them, how are we supposed to know they where duped?
---
I really cant see that the fasnacht rare masks will be removed unless duplicated. I mean, it was an intentionally low drop rate to a community event
---
You can get it off liberators and treasure maps.
---
Great thanks good to know I am on the est but good to know thanks for that o just started last week
---
Me, played since beta and don't even complete the main quest yet...
---
Theres great QoL mods out right now and I remember someone on a discord group I was in posting about a nudity mod so I'm sure we could see more client side graphics mods cleaning up armor or Huds and what not
---
I remember WoW had some deep rp mods too with user created RP items and what not....so I'd say those may be possible too
---
I never have.  I think I found a code for one once.
---
&gt; in the future you’ll be able to mod your worlds
---
Bethesda says this is something they are adding in the future for private worlds.
---

---
I've gotten off a commie bots.
---
It's a hard find.
---
Check out the other replies that are here now. Shotguns are thoroughly fucked.
---
They will likely allow mods on private worlds eventually, but in a limited capacity like they do on consoles. They will either have to cripple them with no gameplay altering stuff that would give an advantage or they will segment your character save like they do in Fallout 4 where once you go to a modded server, you can't go back to a regular one except with an old version of the save file.
---
What many players were hoping for would be able to locally host a server or play offline and mod it to their hearts content. That is never going to happen because of the Atom Shop. This would allow modders to unlock all the paid stuff and kill their revenue stream. Also, releasing the server code would open up a ton of exploits to the regular game and considering how much hacking and duping there is already, it would only get much worse.
---
It is a bit amusing to see that guy frozen and stomping in place as I’m happily looting corpses.
---
Oh no... that would be devastating.
---
I noticed your armor and weapon type in another comment and added some info to that one a moment ago :-)
---
Happens to me too! Usually right after I check my daily challenges to find how many pre-war foods I need to eat and finding i have exactly enough before the crash, but short 1 after the crash.
---
The Legend of Zelda Master Sword and Link's Original Hat/Tunic
---
Yea if it’s not for a SBQ I prefer private as I don’t want to mess things up for anyone else.
---
&gt;Bethesda already soft patched the latter by increasing it's weight to 200
---
Oh, that's just adorable.
---
This is fake
---
201, a couple of characters in the hundreds, an 80 and a 48 and nope never.  I’ve been meaning to but every time I get ready to the servers are being stupid and crash happy. I don’t wanna waste my time.
---
&gt;While the product sucks, supporting garbage like this only serves to confirm the actions
---
I find that to be very ironic coming from a Browns fan! In looking at your post history I have to ask, have you even played the game?
---
More than half of weapons aren't viable due to bugs or bad balance, it's the worst part
---
Never open a pip as you spawn into the game you’ll just have to shut down and reboot. They had that fixed for a little while I guess it’s back to broken again.
---
I'ma do you a solid dude.
---
Fort defiance, get in lift, 3rd floor. Check out the rooms. Not going to tell you spawn locations but they're on the 3rd floor brotherhood side of Fort Defiance.
---
Check yt for actual spawn locations. One girl jumped fort defiance everyday for a month and documented all she got she shows where to find them.
---
Farm. Find and plant a ton of melons, corn and tatos. Go afk for a bit then collets them with the green thumb perk for more. Then go sell them to a trader.
---
I'm sure my monster mask will be included in that unfortunately. I'll be disappointed to lose it if it is removed with this patch
---
It would be great if they could give us an idea
---
Everyone arguing and no one even knows what they changed yet. For damage exploits could something someone mentioned about the bloodied lmg, could be the meat hook, or maybe pipe pistol double dipping, or whatever the one guy was saying about missing damage on PC, or just the fact that so many different melee food buffs stack.... Who knows? Beth sure didn't outline what they are doing, so we wait to log in and find the various "surprises" .
---
I wish that means all effing duped weapons and armors , but apparently they aren’t technically able to do so.
---
Yeah but I'm just pointing out I haven't had any didn't say you or anyone else haven't but euphemism says I don't give a rat's arse if you are in a plane crash muppet
---
That wasn't an exploit though, right? Just really rare.
---
Level 195 here and have never launched one either. I have done everything else in the game and it’s the last thing I need to do so I think I will try and launch one this weekend. Then after that I don’t know if I will play the game. Not much left to do in it
---
Usually back up from 12-1 est (so another 20 minutes). Could be longer, but that's the typical time frame
---
Oh I do hope they don’t get rid of the Gilded Golden Minigun...
---
That was gonna be one of those endgame myths I “hoped” too obtain someday.
---
Oh really? I cant see it being very useful compared to legendaries. But i don’t play NW. Am i missing something?
---
Yes, a lot of people HATE voice chats, icnluding me. So I doubt I'll make many friends. I'm going to install the text chat mod, which allows you to text the gamers who have the same mod, but consider the absence of a normal ingame text chat the worst thing in Fallout 76.
---
My cat can open doors
---
Ghoul Slayer's
---
Well they already said they are going to happen...
---
Bloodied unarmed build?
---
True, it was a legit drop ages ago, but doesn’t seem to drop anymore. I hope that doesn’t qualify as an item that isn’t meant to be in the game!
---
I feel like some kinda of safeguard outside of pvp would be absolutely fine! A karma system could work well too, these are all extra things that would need to be considered when making this mode, my idea is more the start or basis for this mode! These a great ideas :) I was thinking about putting a pve safeguard in when posting, but for the purpose of the post, I thought I’d keep it as “hardcore” as possible!
---
there are still developers/publishers who care about gamers - CDPR and larian being great examples 
---
regularly patch their games, bring out free new content and dont shove micro transactions down your ass
---
That's good to know.  I always kind of liked the Laser Musket.
---
I mean, it wasn't a very practical weapon, but the crank mechanic added a pleasing jankiness to its operation.  Would almost expect to see a similar thing on Radium Rifles.
---
So if I’m in PA all the time, i get zero benefit from the Unyielding I’m wearing? 😫
---
Yes that was just a super rare drop but they did remove it from the drop list at some point so now it's unobtainable
---
Maintenance usually lasts around 3 hours. So servers will likely be back up in the next half hour or so.
---
You can follow [the thread](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/372510/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-november-12-2019?language%5B%5D=en) if you want. It's all the info we've got.
---
DID YOU JUST SAY PVP YOU MAGGOT!?!?1!?1?
---
I have some weapons received in trades. Super rare. Probably duped (idk) But i wouldn’t worry one bit if they disappeared.  I want the FO76 market and economy to thrive and be more exciting
---
I'm level 265, and still have yet to launch a nuke.
---
I have the achievement though. I joined a team to do a trade, and someone else on the team launched a nuke while we were doing the deal.
---
I have only launched one just for the achievement
---
Well to get your daily caps just run through the uranium fever mine forgot wat it's called but u literally take everything every piece of junk and weapons from the enemies and that's laying around in there and slowly walk ur way over to the vendor and sell it as far as selling stuff in my vendor I sell alot of plans junk and some legendaries when I find decent ones just dont overprice honestly better the prices more money u will make ammo sells good too
---
Exactly 👍🏻
---
What features does the gilded Minigun have that a regular Minigun doesn't have?  I don't believe I've ever seen one.
---
NW Armor is a single item while Adv mode armor is put into pieces
---
Kill Super Mutants at West Tek if you are strong enough. Sell their weapons.
---
You should try to beat Skyrim in the meantime
---
How so? The paintball gun was a dev room item that some people got
---
Yeah I agree, but it would suck losing all my gear I traded for. Took a lot of work. How do you know what's duped and what's legit.
---
The Good: The community and a rich huge sandbox to play in
---
The Bad: Endgame and truly difficult content is lacking and repetitive
---
The Ugly: The dev team can't figure out instancing and bugs continually get reintroduced months after they were squashed because different teams are working on an old version of the game code
---
Nothing but the paint job. If you’re on Xbox and mine doesn’t disappear from the display you’re welcome to come see it!
---
Two months?  You got it quick.
---
Let's have a guess what this update breaks
---
^ This. Latest update says they're "performing some additional testing that will require a little more time"
---
Ummm I’ve heard it doesn’t affect xp
---
Interesting. Thanks for the info!
---
Hopefully! Maybe eventually they'll add skins to the game from challenges rather than atomic shop.
---
Moderately-skilledroach
---
I’m under the impression that some of these items have been removed from the game, as they are to return and to be legitimately obtainable during wastelanders! We have seen future skins for the wood armour and mask, as well as promotional material that contains the laser musket.. my wishful thought is these items are getting taken out, so they can be brought into the game legitimately!
---
The only difference is that it has a unique paint scheme. Other than that it's just a normal minigun
---
Lol no. Those bugs aren't impacting their atom shop sales. 
---
But hey, glad they fixed armor not taking damage. 
---
Now buy more repair kits.
---
Ah, right on.  I'm a PS4 guy, but thanks!
---
Most of the masks are legitimate aside from a couple.  I think the old man winter mask is even legit.  The only one I can remember being “illegal” is the jester, but I didn’t give the masks much more than a glance on the trade forums.  Seems crazy to throw top end weapons at a goofy mask that will be readily available next spring, at least in my opinion.
---
I don’t think you or anyone can lose all their stuff. A few maybe, but majority of everyone’s collection should have been obtained from farming and murmrgh. I don’t think anyone would rage quit too if their duped stuff disappears.
---
What I do is do a big circle around watoga train station and kill enemies/loot locations for weapons/armor that consistently spawn and sell them to the vendor
---
The good: the absolutely delightful community. Not always online, but 99% of the people I meet in game are an absolute joy. Everyone helps everyone. Very great
---
The bad: also the community. But online. Couldnt decide between them and Bethesda, but I figure I'll leave shitting on Bethesda to someone else this time
---
The ugly: bugs and poor performance
---
Probably never will, I'm content just to exist.
---
My armor and hazmat suit haven't needed a repair since patch 14, kinda hoping it would stay that way haha
---
I don’t understand. Do you mean “rifle and *pistol*” perks? And do you have the gun equipped with a stock (rifle) or a grip (pistol)?
---
Good: it's fallout. 
---
Bad: it is the greediest fallout game ever.
---
Ugly: the game still feels Beta, sometimes, because of technical issues.
---
Farm legendaries and sell them. If you farm beer and corn you are gonna be poor forever. Hit white springs, west tek and burrows. Over and over. I've gotten 4 3 stars from west tek in one run before. If its junk legendaries then sell for 500 a star.
---
All of these NW cheaters aren't exploiting bugs to fly around one shotting people through walls, they're using third party programs to collect and manipulate the data going to and from the servers.
---
Im jk lol
---
All of these plus go melee and save all the ammo for your vending machines it the only thing I've found that provides a reliable steady income 
---
I'd pick one ammo type and keep a moderate supply for yourself just for the SBQ or the regular scorchbeasts if you dont like waiting for it land
---
10,000+, yes.
---
4,000, though, is attainable with the Power Fist and Gauntlets.  And to be blunt, the reason the Meat Hook is "broken" isn't the dual perk card benefit.  It's because it seems to get double the benefit from food buffs, perhaps as a side effect of the way it is set up.  A Bloodied Meat Hook, on its own, is inferior to the Bloodied Power Fist and Gauntlets.  It's not until you stack the food buffs that the damage goes nuts, and you need at least a couple of them just to reach parity.
---
Correct haha, but if your not a heavy a build then get out of power armor! 
---
Egg head mutation can boost your intelligence a bit if your hurting for xp
---
I hit up Harper'sFerry just for the convenience of the shop right in the middle.  then go to WT for Lego hunting.
---
Frosted glass nuka dark premium rum
---
If you look at my previous reply, I only used the stealth boy to see if it made a difference. Same with the sneak bobble head. I only run armor, perk cards and stealth weapons. Even running around with my 3* fixer doesn't help. I'm far from the only one with this problem. 99% of the players I see in the game run around in PA and/or use melee or machine guns without any idea about what stealth is in this game which is why it'll never be fixed.
---
Don't forget also those giant mutated bats screaming at people.
---
125 and no. Never. Wouldn't even know how.
---
orders received.
---
Ok
---
I get most of mine from running Harper's Ferry and selling the weapons, and by crafting marine tactical helmets and selling them for close to 30 caps each. They only require rubber, molded plastic, and glass. With super duper it's easy to make tons of them.
---
N-no! I meant that I only enjoy PVE and firmly believe that workshops should be a community effort and this game should just be a co-op sin game! I promise!
---
I'm lv121 and got to the key code pad solo but didn't have a code and don't know where to get it or work it out.
---
One part of this game I wish they would fix, when playing Outer Worlds I was blown away by many things including animal enemies being unable to open a door. Imagine going into Fort Defiance and not having random ghouls going up the elevator passed the lasers or the mole rat walking through the laser grid for the enclave.
---
Got one recently in a Liberator Horde mission. That’s probably your best bet.
---
There a slight chance I might have a couple left over, didn't know they were sought after at all. I'll post here as soon as i can log in again.
---
Most of these bugs are probably patched and being tested on the internal wastelanders patch. Its likely why we havent seen any new content or big fixes. They are most likely just setting everything to come out in that 1 patch.
---
That said, what a bs patch again.
---
Remove junk weight from stash inventories for all you greedy bastards!
---
I too would love a hardcore mode, but permadeath would be a no-go for a game this buggy.
---
Almost sounds like they are going to wipe dupes (any weapons that carry the exact same IDs), hope some of the legacies I've bought over the months don't pull a Houdini.
---
There are no “sidearms” in this game. Not really.
---
Also, could you not swing an axe and use rifles? Seriously asking. Is that not viable?
---
I believe the general thoughts are around duped legacy weapons. Im fine with those being gone. The game is too easy as is. With a Bloodied Explosive Gatling plasma, it becomes uneventful after a while.
---
I got a response to mine. 👉 Greetings,

🤦‍♂️ Yup. They answered a question I never even asked and failed to answer the one I did. Bethesda just running a hot streak on failing.
---
Well like I said idk what's duped and what's not. Is my aae laser i traded for duped? Maybe, or my aaffr handmade. Who knows, all I know is that I traded a long time to get these items and more. I think a lot of people would definitely rage if their items dissapeared due to something they had no idea about.
---
I did it to finish the quests
---
That would be cool to see.
---
Yea i should get out of PA more often 😭
---
Bigger question what do ghouls think of the elevator music while they wait as they ride elevator to kill us.
---
Haha i gotcha. I get it now. Shhhh we have no paintball guns bethesda
---
I’m picturing Gilfoyle’s voice and deadpan delivery of this comment.
---
I'm the invisible man in every other Fallout or Elder Scrolls game, but this one seems to feel like doing whatever it wants when it comes to the "stealth" in this game.
---
several people has been banned from market 76 from trading those masks - becasue they are considered dev room items. Also has been duped recently - Wheter they are going to be removed i dont know.
---
🤦‍♂️
---
I got mine off of the Censor Violence event.
---
I soloed one of the launch sites and nuked Fissure Site Prime because I felt it made sense as a conclusion to the main plot. Seeing as how there are no scorchbeasts in Fallout 3 we must have stopped them from spreading, so we have to hijack the Enclave and finish the job the Brotherhood and the Overseer started. 
---
Haven’t launched another one though, I’m here to restore the wasteland and using a nuke to do anything other than kill the Queen seems counter to that goal!
---
they have had mods on Nexus.  "not supported" doesn't equal "against tos".  none of the Nexus mods have been an issue all year.
---
As unlikely as it is, I'm sort of hoping that the Steam release will be a separate thing from Bethesda's launcher.  It'd be interesting to see how trading would work out on a "clean slate" of the game with no duping exploits and no legacies, everyone starting fresh.  I imagine that won't happen and they'll allow us to link our Steam accounts though.
---
Only 1 and that was with a group of guys I found on Discord
---
Well, to be fair, saying “only on Reddit” is itself slightly hyperbolic.
---
I agree. I think that legacy weapons would probably be the only ones to fall under their jurisdiction
---
Nope, day one beta player and I’ve yet to go into a solo
---
I know that. Why are you telling me?
---
If you read any of my messages I defended BGS during all of it.... but this was my last straw. Please read with your eyes before accusing me of whatever shit you’re trying to buddy. Have a good one👌🏼
---
Pretty easy to do so, just bring something strong for the gutsies and assaultrons. In my experience, it’s tougher the more people you bring.
---
I'm seen people nuke whitesprings and it gives decent materials
---
I dont think the economy will thrive if all dupes are removed- probably the opposite
---
Solo launched one back in the early months.  Golf course.
---
If they actually remove dev room items that aren't supposed to be in the game you don't think they'll go through and hit their plans as well while they're at it?  They already did it easily enough when they got rid of peoples bottlecap mines and removed them from being craftable as well.
---
Obligatory "correlation doesn't equal causation" ;)
---
Tbh i don’t even know how. I joined BOS and got my military ID but couldn’t be bothered with finishing the quest so i would assume thats how you meet the enclave and get your clearance up to enter whitesprings bunker and the silos
---
Not just legacy, you can bet your bottom scrip that fixers and good handmades are still being duped and used as currency. I just want a clean and fair in game economy, for that they should remove all duped stuff.
---
Almost certainly the unobtainable Fastnacht masks that were circulating around the trade forums recently.  Whomever traded their high end gear for one is gonna be pissed, but they should have known better.
---
Level 113 with multiple alts nearing level 100, have played more days than not since BETA, still haven't  launched a nuke.
---
Most traded items are duped at this point - at least anything top tier
---
thank you.  I had blinders on
---
Even so, who is going to reimburse all those caps and items traded for what we have. Best way to counter the duped weapons is add level 55 or 60 weapons. That way the other stuff still good but not the best.
---
I only use them for close range, and use the drum mag, so reloading has never been an issue, and the suppressor allows me to stay hidden, so it's worth the trade off.
---
I use laser gat and I live in the power plant every couple days
---
Uranium Fever is my money maker. The station being so close is key, because that shit is heavy.
---
3-4 hours is not a very long maintenance
---
It's actually possible to reduce VATS cost to basically nothing with the right mods and the 25% less VATS cost effect.  If you use VATS at all then it's very much worth it.  I have that same Handmade on my VATS Commando character and I can basically stay in VATS forever, killing entire swarms of enemies in one Gun Fu chain.
---
How about a fix to the front door at West Tec?  My loading screen locks up about 25% of the time when I try to enter.  I resorted to using the back entrance, but I've locked up there recently as well.
---
Sure, sure.. waste your time away in a little bunker with a crazy AI running everything and half responsible for the war that ended the world. You do that.
---
On the other hand, BoS76 is always open to new recruits. Ya know, those badasses rebuilding the world and preventing further devastation?
---
My DMs are open.. we even have ourselves a fancy discord server
---
My gamer tag is “digital press” but message me first because I run 4 different characters and only one has this rare gun.
---
3 going on 4 hours for 6 bug fixes lmfaooo. BGS literally has stopped caring 😂
---
I don't think accusing is the right word, but I can see you like being dramatic.
---
We all have hopes and dreams
---
I hope it gets fixed today. So frustrating.  I'm thinking of switching to a different game.  Red dead 2 maybe
---
eh I'll take a swing and bet it's just the new items (paintball etc) can I use the red bat? it's thicker.
---
I don’t think he is asking what we think they will do but what we want them to do—other the wanting them to shove a ps4 controller up sideways...
---
Yup, it's a good way to get those plans for camp items that fill up the robot vendors that you don't want to pay hard earned caps for. You get them when you do the "defend" workshop event that pops up shortly after you take a workshop and then will show up a while later if no one takes it over in the meantime.
---
LMFAO cute, now get blocked little girl😁
---
I have not been to a game in about 8 years. I stopped watching football. its all rigged anyway because of gambling and all it takes is a handful of cash paid under the table to the right players or refs to control outcomes. The only thing I miss is the tailgating and the people.
---
I'd say comparatively to the past ones. This one just seems to be taking longer. Maybe I am just going through withdrawals 😂
---
Launched my first one around level 280-something a few weeks ago on a private server.  Ran into whitespring giddy at the thought of all those ghouls to myself... Not a single enemy spawned.  Not one single enemy, there was nothing anywhere.  Fast traveled away and came back and still nothing.  Pretty disappointing reality-wise (I gave them my money???) but was happy to have launched my first nuke anyway.
---
Of course,how many people run top end handmades? We all know probably 80 percent arent legit rolls. There wouldnt be near as many people with them.
---
yut
---
It does, I tested it a few weeks back. From 1 intelligence to 13 was an increase of ~20xp. I don't remember exact numbers but it was significant and I repeated it multiple times. Pretty sure the wiki and all the other sources say this is true as well, for whatever that's worth lol.
---
I always put low level unyielding sets on my alts and they level up super fast
---
This happens to my bloodied character all of the time.
---

---
Tbh I've launched hundreds of nukes. Mostly aimed at the queen. But I've done my share of testing other spots.
---
Whitespring if it works is the most efficient way of collating high rad fluids, glowing mass, and hardened mass. Good for cobalt, yellowcake, fluorescent, and crimson. Virtually no violet flux spawns here
---
Harpers Ferry is another decent spot. Good amount of enemies I can usually walk away with around 8-12 per material needed it also has a modest supply of violet flux plants. 
---
Morgantown great for farming material but not so great if you are like me and require large amounts of violet flux
---
Fissure site Prime I feel is the best way of farming material. You kill the queen and get 5 random stable flux and then placement of nuke is key if you put all fast travel locations inside the nuke zone so that you have to fight in the zone all enemies drop the materials needed the amount of violet flux you can get is amazing. It's a lot more work to farm here but it's more possible reward as well
---
These are the best places in my opinion and the reasons and benefits of each. 
---
Thank you for your time
---
Get crafting perks, such as ammosmith, chemist, and super duper. Sell things you craft cheaply, but enough so that you make caps.
---
Sell 5.56mm or 45mm if you don't use them. Those won't last an hour at 1 cap each.
---
Collect weapons and sell them to vendors. Uranium Fever is great for this, as there's a vendor nearby and a lot of enemies tend to spawn. Make sure to equip the hard bargain perk, and take grape mentats if you've got them. Any bonuses to charisma also help.
---
Fusion cores are great, although they weigh a lot. You can generally sell them for 50-100 caps at full charge, although I've noticed that they've been sold more cheaply lately. Might be due to the halloween event having a lot of sentry bots, or perhaps private worlds allowing uncontested workshops. I'm just speculating.
---
If you've met your max scrip for the day, you can probably sell the other junk legendary items for cheap to other players. Some might buy them so they can scrip them.
---
Selling excess junk to players is good, too. Be sure to look up the prices.
---
Believe it or not duping was more beneficial for the market as it meant something could be bought with caps. As it stands now, people only want trades for other strong and rare drops, which means the market is in a bad spot. Keep in mind, some people are selling gear on for RL money, so if you lowered the supply but the demand stayed, who would really benefit?
---
Anytime frame until maintenance is done?
---
got any of them chems man?
---
noper
---
Someone’s been playing on Xbox
---
I’m pretty sure those NW items didn’t break at all
---
Purified water and charisma+perk is a good deal to be rich.
---
😂
---
And being more explicit on end time  going forward.
---
Im like 79 I think? But have never launched one. I still have a TON of stuff to do.
---
Sell through your vendors
---
- ammo
---
- lead, acid, metal, screws, gears
---
- serums (if you have recipes)
---
- legendaries not suited to your build 
---
Sell to vendors for daily 1400 caps:
---
- serums (need to get a recipe - then all that’s needed is to sell 3-4 per day for max 1400 cap limit)
---
- marine helmet (need plan - then craft to sell at 25-30 caps each for daily limit)
---
- craft to sell Top Hat or Civil War cost
---
- sell any weapons,aid or junk picked up and not needed
---
Yes, but if you're going for a VATS focused build then I'd probably just recommend a single rank of Gun Fu, higher ranks aren't really all that necessary and you'll get more damage out of stuff like Covert Operative and high Adrenaline than a situational damage boost that'll reset every time you break line of sight with enemies.
---
😁
---
Interesting! Thanks for doing the research!
---
Granted. 
---
That being said, it really doesn't happen anywhere else on a consistent enough basis, or even at all, to warrant mention. Does that still make it exaggerated or not to be taken literally when its not exageryaed at all given my individual experiencs?
---
Maybe they are maybe they aren’t, it’s like holding a stack of 7 dollar bills and because I worked 12 hours to get paid in those, i should be able to spend them. Counterfeit means counterfeit, i won’t cry if half of my stuff went puff because they were some dupers’ creation. Less duped items = better longevity of the game.
---
You can’t see how masks nobody has a confirmed drop of would be removed? Lol what
---
Imagen them trying to fix alll the bugs
---
 I've got a 970 and I've had the same issues since the game was released.
---
Keep an eye on their website or Twitter. Theyll let us know when they're done. Hopefully soon
---
Because you're complaining that a hotfix didn't "fix" NW.  it's not like implementing anti-cheat in the game is going to be some side project they toss in with no fanfare alongside patching out some durability exploits.
---
Guilty as charged. I feel awful for the PC folks, I used to be one myself. I've seen the videos, pretty awful.
---
I think that particular one might be in the shop all the time.  I think it usually had 5 or 6 all the time.
---
I don’t have a Twitter.  I looked at their website but it didn’t really have any details.
---
yes from the vault to top of the world but ended up in flatwoods
---
This is just facts - dont mean i think duping is a good thing
---
ok fair enough
---
Are you using berserker weapons?
---
That’s fair, and sounds like a cool build.
---
You can’t really say a gun has terrible accuracy when you make it inaccurate with a modification.  You can clearly see the drop in stats while at the crafting bench.  The pump is actually the most accurate of the three shotguns with a long barrel, true mods and no suppressor.
---
They bring back vaulted items like weekly yeah. There's so many items though you have to be lucky and check often to get the specific one you want.
---
They would’ve listed them. If you click the link in the other comment &amp; scroll down there’s a hotfix page that tells you exactly what they’re fixing. Literally like 6 bugs for about 4 hours of maintenance.. makes no sense
---
Things come back into the shop every once in a while.  I remember seeing the "Keep Out" backpack skin returning less than a month ago, and I imagine it'll come back again at some point.
---
Sorry. It's been a long day. x
---
if your are on pc and your aae laser has + 1 perception as 3rd star - it is duped
---
ya outside a couple responses most of them are very good and positive. I mean I will play the game but I wont kiss Bethesda's ass either.
---
Who's general thoughts? Those without the weapons in question, that's who. I enjoy my aae laser and I worked hard to get it.
---
even when that thing works it's always massively delayed to the point of uselessness
---
better off bookmarking the status page or forum
---
The cores you want to use have to be in your carried inventory, not your stash....
---
I only have 2 people on my friends list who are welcome to stuff they need.
---
Hire the law firm of Dewey, Cheetham and Howe. That should do it. Oh, fart into the wind also.
---
If you've hit your limit at the vendors for the day, I find that most mutants carry a couple of caps with them.   I'll hit the WV Lumber Yard and take out a bunch of low level mutants for fun and profit.
---
My two cents; just stop trying to find it until they patch it, you know how stupidly rare it is, you know they will EVENTUALLY patch it to be more common and you don't HAVE to complete the Scout challenges, what you're doing is the definition of insanity.
---
I never bothered launching any until I passed level 120ish. Once I was more familiar with the process, I started with friends, now I just solo silos and launch when and where I please. I like hitting Morgantown due to the spawns there. Whitesprings gets too crowded, hitting Morgantown, you see a lot less traffic.
---
I spent all day Sunday grinding it and I worked on it a little the week before. I had about 10 hours into it.
---
Good: C.A.M.P. building.
---
Bad: C.A.M.P. Budget
---
Ugly: Fallout 1st
---
Yeah I understand that this is most peoples concern! It’s a shame, because this concern is probably exactly what limits an idea like this from actually happening! 
---
When I think this idea has the potential to slightly revive the game and we’ll make it more streamable online, as the element of risk is now finally involved! 
---
Ahwell what else can we do here but discuss what we want from the game?🤷‍♂️
---
Bethesda’s answer: yes
---
i can tell you what's work for me without putting too much effort.
---
i do my own thing until uranium fever is up. Go and complete the event and farm everything!!, pick every damn thing of those moleminers pockets lol you need to get out of there with 800weight or something, then you walk to the train station and sell every armor and weapon.
---
Bonus: the glowing meat sells like 9each one if cooked with hard bargain 3, also you can eat a grape mentats. So cook all that glowing meat and sell them, you can farm like 40 glowing meat from the vent that worth like 500caps, plus every shotgun and shits sells for 20/25 so you would make caps easilly.
---
srry my englando
---
And then there is me still trying to earn my backpack on ps4 lol still need to revive a player.
---
Nobody has really answered the technical side though. Like for example when I played the original Medal of Honor, when you added mods it would only affect your gameplay. For example adding different skins and such. So it's an online game like Fallout 76, will the mods only be able to be used on your own private server? And would everyone that plays on your server have to have the mods installed? I know some of those answers may have not been made but I'm sure there's other multiplayer online games that have use mods before
---
Level 207 and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong to not be able to finish Death from Above :(
---
I generally just sell serums for my daily vendor caps, and get whatever's left by crafting lots of apparel items like Marine Armor Helmets and Witch/Skeleton costume pieces with my excess junk.
---
This is interesting. I assumed it would be account tied or at least event tied. Thanks for the info.
---
A damned nice explanation. Thank you!
---
They aight-roaches.
---
Make and sell 5.56 at a cap per round. Make sure that you have Ammo Smith and Super Duper on. Every day I'm on, I'll put a couple thousand in my vend then go hit the wasteland. It's always gone when I come back
---
but that would require all exploits to be fixed - thats probably aint gonna happen
---
Bethesda has extremely shit servers, and as the servers lag, and sputter, so does the game. That IS how this works. Even when you play on a private world, you are still on the craptastic shithole servers Bethesda uses, and the more of the infinite junk boxes that get flooded beyond the need of the player, the worse it will get. The game had the EXACT SAME issue when dupers were making thousands of TSE guns. The servers cannot handle the memory strain, and begin to cause issues for 90% of players. It will likely become more widespread before it is fixed.
---
No.
---
"It just works"
---
Level 434 here . First nuke when I was level 5 back in February with a little help from other players . But after that did a solo run level 13.
---
I barely play NW, spent a few hours each day for maybe 4 days playing to get the XP. If you couldn't find the time to grind it out in the almost two weeks it was active then tough titties. Those of us that spent the time earning it don't want it immediately made worthless by it being given out for nothing.
---
I have the skin your referring to and it went away a month or two ago. FWIW there’s more then one texture for that model
---
Not having any issues with my Vanguard set. No change to my DR before or after Mischief Night. Still at a solid 502 DR.
---
&gt;Everyone did it.
---
I did not do it. Therefore, the OP's comments are hyperbolic , not because I do not agree with it, but because it is literally hyperbolic, using the literal definition of the word hyperbolic.
---
Here is my go to meds for a long day.[Thomas Benjamin Esq. ](https://youtu.be/TXK03FHVsHk)  warning: NSFW
---
Yes, obviously.
---
But you can't have it both ways, either move or accept that you can't stop blocked players from visiting. It's not complicated
---
I don't believe that they're referring to dupes given that they state that these items were not intended to be obtainable in game and we're only obtained through abusing an exploit. The monster mask that's part of the monster mash event at watoga highschool would fit with this description as well as many of the items pilfered from the dev room
---
Thanks, guess I'll just have to remember to check the shop all the time.
---
&gt; Believe it or not duping was more beneficial f
---
not
---
I'm 78 and never launched a nuke
---
I enjoy the exploration, dis like the lack of crossbow mods, and scorch beasts are just hideous looking.
---
In Dallas myself. Locked in. Haven’t seen another soul in hours. My thoughts, in this frozen tundra, turn to my sweet Clarabell, out there, away from this frigid hellscape.
---
Only with unyielding boosting your stats. My unyielding unarmed can do everything right.
---
I think the best way to make it up (if this is possible) is to give it to whomever got past 8-10k in xp before the window closed.
---
Armors in NW break fast.
---
Thanks, will see if I can replicate!
---
Every week (except last?) there’s been a schedule they post of sales, new items, and vaulted ones. That’s your best source tbh
---
I’m talking about when used in Adventure per the exploit...
---
Never launched a nuke, but then I'm pretty much a pacifist
---
Oh, you must be one of those people who needs everything to be explicitly literal, otherwise it gives you room to argue. So let me get this straight. Did you actually believe that "everyone" did it?
---
There's a confirmed drop of every mask on Xbox
---
No worries at all, hopefully it will be worth a second look "some day"
---
i usually do a plastic run at the cat lady house and then morgantown high school, then pick an area and completely sweep it--i pick up every little thing i see (in classic fallout fashion) and hit up a few red rocket/train stations alonbg the way to break down/stash my junk when i get over emcumbered. after a while of gathering trash i bulk everything i can and only keep stacks of 3 in my stash, everything else gets sold. this, plus all the weapons/outfits/food/chems i pick up and don't want usually get me to my 1400 limit for the day :) i did this every day for about 2 weeks and made 20K caps. also sell 5.56 ammo at your vendor, and anything else you have sell it cheap. new players will buy a ton of 20 cap plans, and old players will buy a lot of 100 cap legendaries.
---
There’s also a volunteer mod on the official forums who posts everyday so you don’t even have to login really
---
Or let us double stack walls again.
---
That's true, but it's fun to imagine what the economy would be like if duping had never been a thing.
---
The same way they can push a 200lb person in 80lb power armor. Because Bethesda.
---
That and a bloodied sneak rifleman
---
I disagree... you absolutely can be a master of melee and rifles.
---
Last min? It was over a half a day early. 🤷‍♀️
---
But, you get a salute pose!  Surely that's worth saturating Appalachia with radioactive fallout! #sorrynotsorry
---
....... yeah I’m gonna pass on that bait buddy. There’s zero confirmed cases of that just dev room squatters
---
I have it built as a rifle. It stacks rifleman and gun slinger perks. I can get my TSE to 502 damage without adrenal reaction or any of that jazz kicking in just perks below.
---
Rifleman, expert rifleman and master rifleman.
---
Gunslinger, expert gunslinger and master gunslinger.
---
Bloody mess and demolition expert.
---
I get around 354 with just Rifleman perks bloody mess and demo. It's bugged I think and it'll be patched but I maxed agility and perception for commando/sneak anyway and I have the other cards (Rifleman and gunslinger). I collect explosive bolt actions because of this and every now and again I switch over to them and have the slowest fun I've ever had lol. If your on Xbox hit me up GT BigBaconBites I can do a video or whatever show you it's legit lol.
---
Oh. So they don't break in adventure?
---
&gt; Did you actually believe that "everyone" did it?
---
No, I can tell when a comment is being hyperbolic.
---
That’s maybe the most interesting build I’ve heard. I had no idea wooden armor was useful.
---
Good for you Captain Literal.
---
Check out Rifle Gaming's Twitter. Also, was the dev room ever accessible on consoles?
---
😬
---
I did it once with two friends so we can get the quest done. Never done it again since then. We do want to launch more nukes, but the issue is having to clear the silos again each time you want to launch one, which just isn't fun. It's tedious and annoying. Not to mention the lackluster combat making it just frustrating as well.
---
I don't see nukes from other players super often, maybe once every two or three days, which is enough nukes for me to get my farming done.
---
Yes, my guess is that's what they're aiming at. They want to introduce legacy in their own subscription paywall
---
Don’t know 100% I’d need someone to confirm but a dev room squatter isn’t gonna come out openly &amp; say it😂 In the hotfix notes they refer to armor &amp; helmet’s not breaking I’m assuming they’re speaking of the NW exploit
---
I got to the last quest about a month or two after release and still actively play the game, I've never launched a nuke as I play solo and it's far too tedious to do on your own so I've never went through with it
---
I've been playing since beta day 1, I have 4 characters with over 500 levels combined, and I have yet to.
---
Was wondering how long it would take for someone to bring up CDPR - one game every 5 years- guess I'll just buy from them and trust zero devs. 
---
Lets see cyberpunk before we all get on our knees eh.
---
Unstable yellowcake for orbital fun beacons!
---
🥴
---
I doubt they'll wipe duped weapons, it'd turn the economy into an even bigger dumpster fire than it already is.  Lots of players would probably quit because their favorite weapon disappeared and they likely didn't even know it was duped with how widespread a problem it is.
---
They're probably just removing weird dev room items that were never intended to be accessible to begin with, like the paintball gun, laser musket, Grognak's Axe plans, etc.
---
You never really know anymore 😆
---
When ever they get done.  Last few updates took quite awhile.
---
post hoc ergo propter hoc
---
Well, OP, you should fully understand that people like you, who are paying 100$ (come on, its ×1.5 price of a new AAA game!!!) for a subscription, are a reason why all this happens and gaming industry degraded so much.
---
Just think about it - why would Bethesda create a new TES or Fallout game, if they can sell an infinite stash and a fast travel gadget for a price of a new game?
---
I will actually thanks for that &amp; yeah I never did it but I heard you had to go to a specific edge of the map &amp; like trap launch yourself or something to get to it. Not as many people as PC but it was accessible for sure on console
---
Doesn't seem likely.  They said they're taking items out of the game that weren't intended to be in the game.  Those legacy weapons were available for months.  Unless they can retroactively detect which of them came from where, I don't think they'll be going anywhere.  Especially since they didn't wipe all of the obviously duped TSE weapons earlier this year during the Great Dupe Wipe of 2019.
---
Use them on Red Rocket truck stop for biggest BOOM ever.
---
Buy it from the robo merchants or hunt liberators.
---
removal of all the duped weapons/armor in the game would be funny at this point...
---
I’m on PC, but I believe you. How much does the explosives perk add?
---
DLC and expansions aren't the same thing though
---
One can only hope, gotta bad feeling tho
---
i got that one the same day that fallout 1st launched, since there was a bundle sale with it
---
I don’t think they are technically capable of doing so. If they could they would have done it long ago. Your duped sht is safe 👌
---
You mean there's no "earn 10 atoms for launching 76000 nukes"?  I'm shocked.
---
Without changing special points around back and forth how?
---
So i doesn't work that way already? I had some high level buying up all my Armor Mod Plans (i had 20+ at 15 Caps each) to resell (they were buying quickly and many that were stacked 2-3 in a bunch) so i session blocked him and the sales immediately stopped.
---
Damn, super introverted level 46 here that has never said word 1 to anyone, let alone coordinated a nuke launch. This makes me feel less weird lol!
---
Did the whitesprings golf club today (not the full arc) Beat all the enemies which spawned at between level 45 and 60 straight away. Killed a 3 star legendary and got a 2 star drop!! Logged out then back in and no new enemies spawned, just lots of bodies still from when I was last in there. Lag was bloody horrendous. Was getting ovewhelmed at one point and near to death, tried using a stimpak and nothing happened. Hit the D-pad numerous times and still nothing then about ten seconds later it used about 6 stimpaks in one go!! I honestly wouldn't go back to a public server if this is how bad it is on a private world. Also Did the One Violent Night event. I let the Wendigo spawn up to a 3 star legendary before hitting it. Got a 1 star Bowie Knife! I think I have got better things to do with my time if I'm honest :-(
---
because most things you can pay for in ESO are super to easy to get by just playing, only cosmetics and some quality of life things are locked behind the paywall
---
They specifically said they're removing items that aren't supposed to be in game, meaning stuff from the dev room. They know that if they were to wipe every duped item, essentially the entire playerbase would quit the game. I know I would
---
No you’re the only one
---
its for guests
---
A lot of people have area turned off because most of the people that are on area don't use Push to Talk and are open mouth chewers lol. 
---
I don't know what to tell you otherwise, though, I end up talking to people every day. Either at White Springs, the SBQ, or in CAMPs. I've had a lot of talks with people in my own camp, when I go back home to make ammo or whatever. Sometimes we just share Heart or Wave emotes and go about our business, but that's still human interaction. 
---
Maybe it's because most of us are long time Fallout fans, and so we're used to playing actually alone, and even an emote is still more interaction than one would get in a previous game?
---
An expansion, if downloaded, becomes downloadable content. And they never said "There will be expansions alongside the dlc like Wrothgar" Chapters were *never* mentioned when they made the promise "All dlc will be included." Just made a loophole and jumped through it
---
They can open the door , so they can bring you that fatman they're carrying as well xD
---
Where is the jet packs fix?
---
Level 61. Haven't done it yet, mainly because I got my ass kicked trying to infiltrate Site Alpha and decided to give it a few more levels.
---
One day I'm gonna drop it on Grafton because DAMN that mayor and his stupid goddamned parades. Also I want the last Overseer tape.
---
Sell two serums and about 10 marine helmets
---
big difference is though that in ESO if you buy something you have content to use it with.
---
Wait, can I switch character's on a private world and workshops would still be built up for the 10-15 minutes? Have you tested?
---
One of my favorite things to do when playing, it’s either that or farming for those three stars.
---
Ps4 here
---
Reddit: "I'm angry they aren't fixing bugs often enough!"
---
Also Reddit: "Why are these bug fixes taking so long?!"
---
At least pick one and stick to it.
---
Thanks for the heads up. I figured he was just stupid, now I know he's sad and stupid.
---
What a hot take!
---
I've never thought of it this way before.  Thank you for opening my eyes.
---
Did any of the other maintenance fix this game, NO, iv just getting home from work to see they have taken NW skeleton costume off for getting 14000exp even though it clearly stated we have until the 12th to get it I only needed 1300, iv defended this game from the beginning but after pay to win and now this IM FUCKING DONE!!!
---
Yeah had that today. A couple of 3 star legendaries dropping 1 star weapon and amour. Waste of bloody ammo!!
---
The only good bug is a dead bug.
---
C'mon you apes, you wanna live forever?!?!!
---
Talking to you is boring and pointless. Bye
---
Level 232 here, I've launched 10 at least solo, a few with friends. I do queen fights for the Flux and repair kits. It in a round about way keeps my stash down so I don't have to keep my stash full of repair mats. It allows my mercantile ambition to keep going at its current rate. A butterfly effect of sorts.
---
Lvl 413 1900 hrs launched 1 nuke and the game crashed.
---
You must be new....
---
It's fun, It's unique, and the people that play it don't really sweat the details. If it's not your cup of tea don't play it, but it is my cup of Sweetwater special blend tea. So I'm going to keep playing it until it's not.
---
lol that doesn't matter when you compare the prices of things. Quit moving goalposts my guy. Besides, what's the excuse when F76 has the time to improve like ESO did?
---
182 here.  Solo ran Alpha. Got to entering the code and my game crashed.  I was going to hit Fort Defiance.
---
Lol the krill army has returned I see. If you read any of my comments you’d know they’re literally fixing 6-7 things &amp; it’s taken 4 hours. I don’t play 76 anymore after they took away the NW event a day early with no word still. Just pointing out how stupid they are. If you reply again you’ll be promptly blocked krill 🥱
---
"  Less duped items = better longevity of the game."    i think this is the wrong conclusion .  I think more people would quit as a result of boredom if they couldnt  get good items.
---
More content , better in- game drops and more bugfixing would be better for the longevity of the game imo.
---
I understand what you mean. I should’ve worded my comment better. What I meant is that saying this game, being a Fallout game too, doesn’t need NPCs which keeps the world of Fallout’s world alive is a bit of a stretch lol. A lot of online games have NPCs along with The Elder Scrolls Online.
---
Your a little late to pissy pants complainer party.
---
I'll never understand why folks hate on Destiny, it's just not your kind of game man - let the rest of us have fun.
---
Yeah I've just been telling myself it is the ghosts of all the ghouls I've killed at the clubhouse or the super mutants I've killed at West Tek coming to get their revenge lol.  It doesn't really bother me just curious why it happens lol.
---
Stop making me lol while I'm at work.  I'm supposed to be working.
---
Help an old timer out here please, whats RNG mean

revolvers also have no way to get armor penetration outside of legendary effect (no ammo/perks)
---
Cockroaches can flatten out to fit through just about anything. They could come under a door pretty easy.

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2016/02/08/watch-amazing-video-reveals-why-roaches-are-so-hard-to-squish/

Snallygaster spit attack explosion could be one.

With roach clips, ofc
---
&gt; essential mechanics were locked behind a 15$/month paywall?
---
There is nothing essential at all in Fallout 1st. You can pay nothing and have zero effect on your game and experience.
---
i dont know anything about what rolls has been duped on ps4 .  Only follow pc trading
---
Best ways IMO:
---
1-build on a lead deposit, collect and sell while you build and/or travel. Most people can use lead and at 2-3 caps each, you’ll sell fast. Grab some from gyms too when you’re near one already.
---
2-Hop to farm and sell legendaries from Whitespring, West Tek, Legendary Scorchbeasts, and events.  
---
3-Also- sell weapons collected from said West Tek or Uranium fever runs.
---
4-learn regular spawn points for other legendary creatures as you go in case you’re in the area. Murder, sell.
---
5-take over the munitions factory up north rightat the start of a session, pump out 5.56 and stop by now and then to collect. (And hope no one shows up). Option to collect lead and other stuff there too with extractors. Sell said 5.56.
---
6-learn spawn points for plans and sell.
---
7-learn locations for level 3 safes, loot, sell high level weapons to vendor bots and plans to fellow players.
---
8-farm rare clothing bots using the anchor method, sell said clothing.
---
9-price stable flux you’ve collected but don’t need below 100 caps and you’ll sell quick
---
Past &lt;------------ we are here -----------------&gt; Future
---
No one knows past the word "here."
---
I usually don't have Tuesdays off so I haven't experienced one of these before. Is this longer than usual?
---
Sounds like they messed something up in the process. What a surprise.
---
in what country are they charging $15 USD monthly?
---
Excellent!! Thank you! I'll have to pick up some wallpaper!
---
What would I need if I wanted to build a Auto rifle character?
---
Lol yeah the hotfix lists like 6-7 bugs being fixed for 4 hours. Kinda ridiculous at that point.
---
Yeah, gave me a little heart attack. The Game Server indicator said it was online, so I tried, and it said I didn't have the proper authority. Thought I'd gotten banned. Good thing I thought to check the portal status on the website.
---
&gt; I don’t play 76 anymore
---
And there it is.  Why are you complaining about the game being down if you don't even play the game?  Go outside or something.
---
Me, I tried running solo but that was super hard. I couldn’t finish
---
Alright krill, have a good one. BLOCKED🥰
---
I only hated on Destiny because their ten year plan was literally "We're gonna come out with 5 dlc in 2 years, then come out with Destiny 2 with another 5 dlc in 2 years, then come out with Destiny 3 and keep making dlc for it"
---
But I played the first one and had a lot of fun, like a lot of fun. Sure the above sounded greedy, and I'm glad they did drop the number of DLC released down, but at least they were honest with it
---
How do you get and or make serums?
---
well hey, chapters still are included a year after release. also looking at the website, eso+ specificly says "Full access to DLC game packs" pretty sure game packs and chapters arent the same things
---
Loads*
---
The Good: The in-game community, the build possibilitys, the player vending, the event diversity, the Wastelanders and Wild Appalachia updates, the Armors, Guns and PA diversity. Also the creature diversity, the Enclave as a plot twist, the global fallout lore being expanded and not broken by it, etc...   
---
The Bad: Lag, annoying bugs, Fallout 1st features, the low amount of scrips, caps and atoms earnable per days, Nuclear Winter cheaters and the people that complain about things that arent that important.   
---
The Ugly: The game needs to improve, but it is at least average now, and a lot of issue needs to be fixed, features added, etc... That being said, the game realy isnt as bad as people say it is. In facts I have been playing ever since December of 2018, and so far i'm having a lot of fun.
---
I usually nuke just north of Grafton for violet flux, with green thumb I can easily pull off 400 raw flux per nuke zone, that's how crazy it is.
---
Not sure why people still think Cranberry bog is still the best, here's a map. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/422813649774837772/616590911559958529/KHDQIV7.jpg
---
Buy serum recipes and do lots of queens
---
Nah pretty standard
---
They already made them weigh 200 pounds, why bother removing them?
---
thanks
---
Buzzwords are required when you run down Fallout 76.  These phrases come neatly packaged in the Angry Joe starter pack available on YouTube.  
---
Objectively bad!
---
Fundamentally broken
---
Essential Mechanics!
---
Dumpster Fire!
---
And other timeless classics.
---
First off, nothing is behind a paywall.
---
Secondly, you came to a gaming subreddit and wonder why people here like this game?  Quit trolling.
---
they don't need to remove legacy stuff or the dupes therof.. just making them untradeable would do the trick..
---
He'll be glad as I have a clip of him / her abusing the game mechanics :)  
---
Don't worry though, I'd never share it - was just intrigued when I saw what you were doing so recorded a clip.
---
Where can I buy the recipe?
---
What I am saying it is very unlikely for this dataminer to have been banned just for *running* CE (without knowing he needed to change the exe file's name etc etc) while he was playing F076. That is just a *terrible* excuse, *if* that is what he is claiming. He's a dataminer with software dev skills, right? These guys know all about anti-cheat measures, even over-zealous ones, especially those used in Fo76, which have been known via this subreddit for a year!
---
I think a lot of this is hearsay. We don't *really* know what happened. Only he does, despite what you may have been told, or are just assuming. Also, just because someone provides useful tools and helps the community does not mean they couldn't have used any of their knowledge for their own personal gain.
---
Got it from the liberators in Watago Medical, near the stairs
---
Level 200. Went on two different nuke runs with others but never did the actual deed. Recently decided to collect a full set of Troubleshooter's armor to try it solo (which is how I play 99% of the time anyway).
---
There seems to be a point where the scorchbeasts stop spawning by the prime fissure site.  If I miss the SBQ fight, I might see two or three Bravos spawn, but that's about it.
---
My luck for High Rad Fluids is abysmal, I might get 3 in 30 to 40 mob kills.
---
More content is of course good. But the ‘endgame’ of FO76 is the legendary rewards. Now if people can skip all the farming and grinding and get their ‘godrolls’ easily, soon there’s not much else to do and they will move on to other games. Less time spent in game = less chance to buy and spend atoms = less income for BGS.
---
Cook the moth man eggs into omelettes. More caps that way.
---
[](/ppchainsaw)Kill them all, Tom, that is, and has always been your quest.  
---
-signed your imaginary friend.
---
I dont think it's a plan, pretty sure it's just available as a mod.
---
Keep finding the mod on the crate next to the workbench behind the bathrooms at Camden Park.
---
Also got a mod for it from a treasure map last night.
---
Enclave bunker at whitesprings
---
i know forgot to add that
---
Presh man
---
Neither have I. Level 80.
---
A current elder scrolls game does have a subscription fee. ESO.
---
They are not fixing anything, they just to make it look like they are hard at work on patching up bugs in the game!
---
We're down for maintenance so I can't check but it's honestly not much I keep demo because I've always run explosive but I'd swear it's really only like 15% the card says 60% but it's not accurate at all on my opinion. If I pop demo off for repairs or something my damage reads at 298 or so on my AAE bolt action. I feel like non explosive will still hit high 200s.
---
I'm literally considering trying out a nocturnal explosive (if I can find one) version with sandman etc equipped just to see what it does.
---
You can level up pretty quickly in Fallout
---
You can buy recipes in the enclave bunker. With perks they’re 17.5k caps each. Or once in a while a player will be selling. 5k to 7.5k from what I’ve seen.
---
Nice joke!
---
The challenges ran UNTIL the 12th. Not thru the 12th. They ended at 12,Nov. 12:AM GMT which, if you're in the US, was late last evening sometime.
---
Level 70 something and launched a nuke once and it was with my friends back in the first 2 months of the game coming out.
---
But when they made the promise that "DLC will be included in ESO+" Chapters did not exist. They made a loophole to have people buy new content with real money, no crown purchases. And if they did plan Chapters in the first place, then it was dishonest to not tell the community about it when they made the "all dlc will be free to plus" comments.
---
I'll grant you that they did make each chapter with plus free when the next chapter came out though, I think it was mostly due to community backlash
---
It's not opening the door, the door just goes "Ewwww, a roach!" and flees
---
It's so much better now that they own the whole thing themselves and don't have to get permission from a different company to make QoL changes to your own game...
---
Or break after one shot
---
Track down the Sickleman.
---
Like I said, to avoid player rage just make level 55 weapons. That would give it a fresh start, but the old stuff would still be good. This isn't real life, it's a game and it wouldnt be fair to wipe peoples stuff who had nothing to do with it being duped.
---
I tried... Without realising you needed a code and you lose the nuclear card when enter wrong code.
---
Oops.
---
After a nuke can you make the Feed The People quest start inside the building?
---
It is also available as a plan.
---
It's a good idea to eat one of them for the Charisma boost before selling too.
---
Iv played for a year and never dropped one 
---
mostly because of the games crashing
---
Sell junk and Aid from the One Violent night event. Also use cap collector perk and get cap stashes.
---
ESO didn't affect Fallout 4 and ESO is MUCH more predatory than F76
---
Selling serums is the easiest that I’ve found. 500c each and I make them for friends as well if they provide the flux. I have two recipes and use either fluorescent or yellow cake. You get stable flux from SBQ or can farm it.
---
I’ve removed mine for Emergency Protocals. The jet pack was only neat when I could flex it back in the day when it was really hard to get. Now anybody with a few caps can stroll in the bunker and grab it.
---
I haven't since they made the mainframe cores weigh 1.5 each.
---
Probably for the opposite reason people make stupid posts on a reddit page dedicated to a game they don't play.
---
 I mean what kind of miserable life do you have to have to make these kind of posts?
---
That is the one way I found out about last night. Just don’t end the event and legendary ghouls come rolling in every other minute for 20 mins straight
---
OP won't respond to any of these comments, everyone can go home lol
---
As a member of the Responders, I find that difficult
---
Thread #17363 about the same thing I've read for the last 2-3 weeks since 1st came out.
---
You would think they could make the fix on a dev server then apply the fix within minutes to the public servers.
---
Level 340. 1 nuke. Not to much of a care to ever do it again. Just wanted to finish the quest.
---
Thats a lot of caps. I need to get serious man
---
Yeah I made three new chassis with different chest mods to use since they seem to be unable to fix this jetpack bug. I love mobility, so this bug really ruins a large chunk of my fun.
---
But unless people buy for real money - they cant skip the grind . They need to have a lot of caps or good items to trade with.  IT is just that with duped items around they have something to look forward to - there ARE actually thing to trade for .  
---
I dont think many people realise how many of the top tier items are duped.    I also think your idea of how motivation to play the game works is far to simple
---
I'm level 70 tried to launch one sunday night solo. I failed. Was my first attempt and I wanted to finish all the story achievements before starting a new character. Depleted my stims and ammo fast  eventually tried to melee through it. After around two hours I gave up. I would have invited people to join but I'm not very sociable online. I also want it to be my challenge now to solo it first time.
---
Guess its time to start scavenging the wasteland, again.
---
This is BGS that’s too simple!😂 instead they’ll lock paying customers out for 4+ hours!
---
🤪
---
Level 96 and I’ve launched a good 8 nukes. Normally wait until I have enough plasma/fusion cores and just collect all the lead and steel for ammo, afterwards I enjoy farming legendaries and a good queen fight
---
Iv just given up on it TODAY, actually about half an hour ago, iv grinded NW all weekend and a couple of hours after work yesterday to get the glow in the dark skeleton costume, I had 1300exp to go iv getting home from work turned it on and they’ve taken it down even though they said we had til the 12th to get it.
---
I understand that it might be a different time zone but if it says the 12th on my PS4 which is in my countries time zone then I expect to have til 12 midnight to get it, if I don’t then state what time I do have till
---
is been their for a long time
---
Im just curious why people would buy into the microtransactions. I owned the game myself, but I'm one of the people who got a refund.
---
The mines were back in and got spread with the mine dupe. Odds are they were removing them
---
I'd laugh so hard if this happens, and we'd probably have a lifetime supply of salt. Actually kinda hope it does.
---
Alas, pretty sure they refer to dev room items, and stuff that was sneaked into adventure from nw.
---
Go to Van Lowe Taxidermy in Lewisburg and read the 4 notes on the noticeboard upstairs.
---
I'm aware, but i meant future titles.
---
SInce the question was asked by someone who doesn't know about flux, I would also like to add, when looking at recipes, the game will say you need  *pure* flux.  Pure is the same as stable flux.  It seems there was an oversight on making sure the woerds used were matched up.
---
That one is inside a load zone in the building, right?. Enemies inside buildings that aren't open to the outside world don't get effected by nukes. I did see The Messenger pop up last night when I nuked there, but I was about to log out, so I didn't do it. Any of the wave events that are outside are great for nuke zones.
---
Then in my opinion it should say that, it should tell you exactly what time it is going down in your country, if I knew that I could have getting it last night
---
We haven't even gotten the wastelanders update, so don't know how that's a good...
---
With the difference being ESO isn't broken and actually an mmo.
---
Brilliant
---
The only time I launched a nuke was at Morgantown and I dropped it right in the path of some low levels doing The Messenger.
---
Pretty much this.  Without the DJ chatter, everything just repeats so often I turn it off.   Makes me a bit sad since I loved this part of the FO series.
---
The good: the game world, massive, interesting, cool locations/enemies and world building I all really loved, fun weapons and builds.
---
The bad: for me it's always the stability issues/glitches, it sucks that the game just never really runs well for me 100% of the time.
---
The ugly: overdependence on microtransactions and the fact that more resources get diverted to that than actual earnable content in game at the moment.
---
Good point! Bethesda definitely needs a copy editor on staff.
---
lol k that doesn't mean shit when comparing their cash shops my guy
---
Never even had the gear to launch a nuke, level 60 maybe and just sucking ass over here😂😂😭
---
Well there is a good chance for it to be better than Nuclear Winter. The BR in NW was good, but it got infested with cheaters, so...
---
 find . -name "TSE HANDMADE" -exec rm -rf {} \\;
---
I have launched at least one, maybe 2? It's a big hassle since I don't have many FO friends and I have to solo a lot.  Especially when compared to the people who seem to be able to launch mere minutes after killing the SBQ.
---
When you realize you're wrong but you're so insecure that you can't even admit it to some internet stranger that you'll never see again.
---
The right legendary effect on the right weapon can make all the difference for gunfu. I have a handmade with -25% AP cost in vats. Combined with all other AP reduction mods, my shots cost zero. I did a queen fight the other day and was occasionally swapping targets to keep up gunfu and adrenaline stacks. I was putting hundreds of rounds into her at 30% gunfu before line of sight would break from her flying away or someone running in front of me.
---
I am certainly not built for a queen fight, but I was getting about 50 damage per shot and 200 every critical hit. Every three shots when critical on an automatic was popping up as doing critical damage, so I was actually getting 600 damage every activation. I have 80 in my clip (quad), so I was doing upwards of 8,800 damage before every reload (2,400 from regular shots, 6,400 from criticals. Not amazing, but not bad for a PVP focused build
---
Then why buy first?
---
San Antonio. It's 34 out. There was some ice accumulation on bridges early this morning. They've closed those roads until Thursday. Bread and water rations run tight. Everyone knows nothing else is edible, so the stores lie bereft of these most basic supplies. The Freeze may take us all. Godspeed, Dallas, as the weather says you've devolved into an Arctic tundra. When they said Wastelanders was coming, I didn't know it would be an AR expansion. I know now. Wastelanders is here, and we are doomed.
---
Level 55 will continue to be duped, it’s not going to stop unless they make a clean wipe of all duped items and perma ban the dupers. Don’t worry about rage quit, people are just saying. Remember that ‘900 hour guy’ duper? Even he came back after being banned and started playing again.
---
I agree. They should add a countdown timer to those challenges like they do for limited time atomic shop items. So we know exactly how much time is left before it expires. 
---
To be fair though the challenges ran for two weeks so most players that wanted the items were able to get them.
---
Yup.   
---
When you enter an unclaimed workshop zone, you got a big message on screen about taking the workshop (as an event).  
---
Owning a workshop opens you up for PvP as long as you are still inside the zone.  If you are not interested in PvP, then check the area for other players, especially those way above your level.  
---
If none, then clear the CG enemies.  Again check the map for nearby players, then claim the workshop as you see fit.  
---
While it is showing the claim progress bar, head to the edge of the zone.  As soon as it is claimed, step out of the zone. ( I think you can actually step out while the claim is in progress, but I haven't tested it)  
---
You'll see the event complete screen, then you will be rewarded with a number of items.  There's always a plan of some type. 
---
Since you have stepped out of the zone, you cannot be PvPed for ownership.
---
Eventually, you'll get a defend workshop against xxx notice on screen.  (where xxx is either another player or CG enemies.)   
---
If its CG enemies, check the map.  If its not another player, (remember, crouched (chameleon, and/or stealthboy, I think) enemies cannot be seen on the map).   if clear and if you can stay outside the zone and snipe all the CG enemies, you will have successfully defended the workshop, and you will again get a number of rewards, including another plan.
---
Be Aware! If you inadvertently re-enter the zone during a defend, all bets are off.   You are now subject to PvP.  You can be one shot and lose the workshop, a number of caps, and likely, the junk you are carrying.
---
Of course, you can always buy the plans from one or more vendors, but some of them get pricey.
---
ergo, take the workshop for the plans, and get your mats elsewhere.
---
i dont have the original text but the website right now just says "dlc game packs"
---
i can still understand that every major/big expansion cant just be given out for free to those paying 10 a month, because its still content they worke long on
---
😓😮😦🚧        😲🌋😨🌋🌋😱😲🌋
---
No that was ALL armor! You haven’t noticed that none of your armor degraded for the last week? It was fun while it lasted, players have a little extra ballistic fiber to show for it at least.
---
I’ll jump in here on this as that’s what I’m building now. But mutations really help. Twisted muscles and talons help boost your melee if your focusing on rifles.
---
It's certainly not a bad investment to put Gun Fu all the way at rank 3.  I just personally don't like it higher than rank 1 that much because most enemies will die in one hit anyway, and at SBQ fights you'll have some dingus in power armor walk in front of you and break your VATS targeting half the time.  I keep it at rank 1 because it's not consistent enough to invest 2 extra points in, and I just like it for the target swapping effect.
---
Ooooh thank you
---
I feel like that would be a whole lot of fun, I like the whole surviving by the skin of my teeth type gameplay than the "oh I died, but it doesn't matter at all" type gameplay that is adventure
---
16 times the repairs
---
That is true but it really is a good game
---
Comparing a BR mode to Wastelanders which is a DLC for the adventure mode of the game makes logical sense even tho they are two seperate things. With how everything has been going as to late for this game... I doubt wastelanders will be that big of an expansion to keep me wanting to play but time will tell.
---
ESO actually has playable content behind the subscription fee, while i dont much condone putting expansions behind a subsctiption fee i understand it, it actually entices players. If wastelanders and a couple other larger scale expansions were "free" for first subscriber it wouldn't even be that big of a deal since the option to wither buy the expansion or pay for the subscription would be there. The problem arises when all you get for a subscription is the right to biy more stuff, mod support and some quality of life stuff
---
&gt;Two fixes have been implemented today, and the rest will arrive with the full hotfix once we’ve resolved the issue discovered during downtime. We will let you know once we’re ready to move forward with this hotfix in the next few days
---
They're not very clear here...
---
There was an issue with the update, yes. But are they keeping servers down til they get everything worked out?
---
Or are they bringing the game back online, then will try to the hotfix again in a few days
---
It's official , the last guy working on the game went home, he'll be back soon and continue with the hotfix
---
Same here. Tons of lag
---
They worked on the dlc though so that doesn't make much sense, plus ESO+ is $15 a month unless you get another membership rate
---
It's a very weak legendary weapons with vats accuracy and bashing damage, yet i can solo the queen with it and kill anything under a few seconds without dps perks... :D i almost forgot to mention it's a level 35 Ultracite gat laser
---
Oh wow... nah I stopped playing after they lied about the NW event just lurking cause the community was the only reason I still played so it’s hard to leave that behind. But wow yeah that’s awesome. Isn’t there a perk that makes it take less materials to repair your armor? Could’ve sworn but I might’ve made it up
---
I don't figure they'd just shut the game down for a few days.
---
Well, we cant know for sure if it will be the best thing Bethesda ever made as a lot of people think it is, but lets not be too negative about it, negativity is what usualy kills a Fallout game.
---
🤣😂😞 I also want an empty pumpkin rack I can place anywhere.
---
They should, but I doubt it.
---
Every PVPer I meet is running around with raid armor and explosive harpoons for one shotting folks. There shouldn't be anything wring with trading others for what you want, but that mechanic is dead if people just grab the legacy broken stuff. PvP turns into an arms race. Everyone buys it, so I should too becomes the mentality. Kinda similar to what I've heard about original counter strike and cheating.
---
Main reason I want a season based survival mode to return is to get away from this arms race mentality.
---
Probably pacific standard time which is GMT-7
---
Greed is what kills a fallout game.
---
I would assume yes
---
16 times the bugs
---
Sounds pretty unlucky bud, never had those problems before.
---
I am level 633 and I launch around 6 nukes a day it's so much fun killing scorched beast queens plus all the xp you get out of the even from all the enemies
---
Fix 1 bug create 2 more. Bethesda is Hydra.
---
Also, along those lines go check out the Southern Belle Motel.  Not going to tell you where, but there is a hidden quest in a note.
---
Ive got it pretty good. I'm getting married, got a dog and finally got a refund for 76 last week.
---
No, because I only play solo and the one time I attempted that mission I couldn't make it through the bunker and blew through all my ammo and stimpaks and most of my weapons and armor broke, so I said "F this" and never went back.
---
....SURPRISE!
---
Well, Bethesda is a small indie company, we can't expect them to be able to fix everything...
---
Ha. I never paid attention to that. Thanks!!
---
145. Launch about 25 to 30 nukes a week, triple server launch kill sbq then hop servers and do it again. 
---
That sounds extremely like bragging, but I'm not sure there's another way to word it. Nukes the easiest way to get an attempt at 3star leggies next to purveyor. And it only takes less then 10 mins to run a silo.
---
If that's the direction you really want this game to take, I imagine it eventually looking something like this. On the one hand you'd have the Fallout 1%ers who if there actually is more development can: do what you like! craft your own legendary weapons, mod your game, shoot lasers from your nipples honestly we dont care keep giving us money. On the other hand over on Peasant76 we'll all be running around in nocturnal wood armor offering our bitchin locksmith/scuba services, or mowing lawns and offering pest control at the same time with our Exterminators Mr. handy buzzblade! Unsuccessfully trying to sneak past and then running from hoards of enemies strangely not carrying anything on them should they happen to die. And if you find yourself in an altercation with another player, proudly holding our new legendary "safety" boards up to our shoulders yelling (with our indoor voices of course) "PEW PEW!!!" 
---
I agree with your point of consequences to certain things, but id rather see it go the other way first. Instead of bring the game even further down why not just elevate all the useless builds? Just because bloodied is the nail sticking out higher than the rest it doesnt mean you should hammer it down into the coffin that this game will rest in once you do. Make mutants weapons scale up for each mutation. Have berserkers get other benefits other than giving a boost that in no way justifies having no defense. The list goes on. If you want to penalize something though (and then watch people loose their shit afterwards) make stealthboys have a cool-down timer before using another one
---
Looks like the servers will be back up soon, they've updated the right hand corner news section, but still can't log in
---
I get that, not saying that it can’t be done, but it’s never going to be optimal. You’re still surrendering perks by cross-classing. A pure melee build with those mutations and all the related perks is going to be a more powerful melee character 100% of the time.
---
If you look at it closely, you can see people complaining about each Fallout games ever since Fallout 3 (and yes even New Vegas). The "greed" you are talking about killed Fallout 76 at launch, that only had useless cosmetics on the atom shop. Everything was overpriced, but everyone also had a shit load of atoms. Then came the real greed, Fallout 1st, with I agree can't be defended, but that isnt what killed the game.
---
I launch them when one is already there at precisely the same spot as the current one. See how many people aren't paying attention
---
Craft loads of Marine Tactical Helmets and sell them all in one go. Easy. 1 Plastic, 1 Glass, 3 Rubber per helmet.
---
Real money for sure, also caps are easy to acquire, dupers also have friends and their cousins. The closer you are to the source the easier to acquire duped stuff. It’s like counterfeit money. It’s up to each individual’s judgement to find out what they’re dealing with. But the counterfeit needs to be gone period.
---
You're right you don't have to pay 100$ for a mansion but you have to pay 13$ or 100$ to get a 2nd campsite, unlimited junk storage, and stupid cosmetics that we promised would be available in the atomshop without having to purchase the atomic bundles.
---
Its possible to skip the following items:
---
- reactor room
---
- mainframe
---
Let's not forget there is only one guy working on the game and he does it when he's off collage and his actual job.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/fallout1st
---
Scrap Box is crossing the Line IMO but honestly i think a lot of people bought it for the Ranger Armor and Atoms (Scrapbox, tent, and a Private world just being an extra perk). At least that's what i hear from the people in game wearing the armor when i ask them.
---
Random Number Generator. It's also slang for something that has odds applied to it, though most games actually physically use an RNG formula. It's basically what decided just about everything that happens in FO76.
---
They can't put content behind the F1st sub, it's going to be free for everyone. The F1sters are paying for the content basically. Would much rather that than making everyone pay.
---
 If they added the same level of incentives that ESO has (increased XP gain and increased gold drops) then people would scream p2w more than they do now. 
---
As it stands there's really no need to even keep a subscription, get one month to dump your junk, hoard it for a month, never worry about junk again.
---
I wonder how many of these fixed exploits were reported by players who were then banned for reporting them.
---
Still close to a week
---
At what point in your life did reality start slipping away from you?
---
 Someone who has it "pretty good" doesn't make miserable posts to try to make other people around them miserable.
---
I don't think I can be your imaginary friend anymore Tom. Your no fun, you never do all those chems I keep telling you to, or eating all the dead people we keep finding. It's not me, it's you.  
---
I wish you the best in playing doctor with woodland critters or whatever you do, but I'm going to go hang out with the insane lady at that ski club.
---
Level 60, never launched a nuke. I have hearing issues so I don’t use a mic. I doubt I’ll get the chance because of that.
---
Doesn’t change the fact that they been advertising the 12th and ended it earlier.
---
I have only experienced it once and it only lasted about 3 to 3 and a half hours.  Its been about 5 hours now.
---
Exactly! For me a gritty hardcore pvp wasteland is the real wasteland, and for me.. trying to complete the games main quest line under these scenarios.. would be the real fallout 76 experience! 
---
Although I imagine doing a Queen in a mode like this would be near impossible.. maybe she gets a little nerfed? And like was previously mentioned have a pve safeguard
---
"Sir, have you tried turning it off and then turning it on again?"
---
Wow, that's a lot of blue up in Grafton.
---
I'm lvl 250 and haven't fire a nuke yet
---
Is it a "hickup" instead of a "hiccup" because it's in WV?
---
It's just such a shame the ranger armor doesnt look as good as the f4 mod version. The atoms i kind of understand, alot of games give you some of the "real" currency, but it should be enough to at least get some of the better stuff in my opinion
---
I’m 132 and I’ve launched it once. And I wish I was your lobby. It’s seems ages since someone has launched one. Now, let me be specific. I mean I want them launch at the queen and not white springs. My base is there and it hard to take a nap when you’re taking on so much rads. And it’s definitely not comfortable taking one with a hazmat suit on.
---
Welcome to the party, kiddos.
---
Lvl 275 and never launched one personally.
---
So just perma ban the dupers and up the level. No reason to wipe anything if there's a better version available to acquire.
---
caps may be easy to get - but if you need 100k + to get a b2525 handmade you still need to grind for some time.
---
Also  - far more people has left the game for lack of content and fustration over bugs  than because the good great items to fast
---
I'm not trying to make anyone miserable, friend. I'm just trying to understand things.
---
Yeah, it was amazing to be able to fly over and few people owning jetpacks.
---
Lol I’m a dumbass, thank you for that 😂
---
You are referring to “White Knight”, I use this too but didn’t need it last week. I wonder if the half-fix they did today did or didn’t fix this. We’ll find out shortly!
---
Exactly me, got injured on saturday and couldnt play till yestuday, it was gone when i had around 1k xp left..
---
That’s fair enough but I don’t play NW so I didn’t knoW about it, I just put it on for a change at the weekend.
---
it’s funny how they have a count down for something you have to pay for but if you can win it for free the don’t count down. That’s fucked up
---
Greed greed greed, this has all the elements of a free to pay game but cost me £60!
---
Later he claims he was unbanned, but does nothing to clear Bethesda for a circle jerk he started. It would be hilarious to see how quick they turn on him though. 'that dataminer is a bethesda shill!'
---
Wont it just disappear at the end of the month?
---
I hear what you're saying, but you can't even scrap anything at that goddamn tent, it's almost useless because it doesn't have as much as even a barebones noob camp would have. I don't remember anybody promising no cosmetics in atom bundles. ESO+ has even worse P2W incentives, how would you have felt if F1sters also got an xp increase plus more cap drops?
---
"**We are working to bring the game back online shortly**. Thank you for your patience during today’s extended maintenance."
---
Sounds like they are bringing the servers soon and the other fixes will be at a later date
---
Documented and submit, thanks again.

[Fallout 76 Bug Roundup | Weapon - Ranged](https://www.reddit.com/r/76BugWiki/comments/dfh1va/fallout_76_bug_roundup_weapon_ranged/)
---
You don't understand why people enjoy and like something that you don't?
---
Does this bother you enough that you have to make posts about it?
---
Do you walk around restaurants and ask people why are they are eating a food that you don't like?
---
Looks like they can't fix it all today. Their fixes need a fix. LOL At least we'll have indestructible armor for a little longer.
---
I love these questions as they just show how little the game actually helps you with even the base fundamentals.
---
Like finding wallpapers - you'd think that it'd be in the actual build menu....but nope, and its just up to you to go find where it is thank you very much lol
---
For real! Those pesky, sneaky ~~rifleman~~ archers are a plague on ~~Whitesprings~~ Whiterun, even if I am one too!
---
Their greed and their bullshit excuses is whats digging this game a hole. Between fallout 1st and the games original launch and them "not being able to help players who 3* legacy randomly proofed from their inventory" or other matters similar. Bullshit, they can literally use commands to recreate said weapon/armor/outfits/etc.  They have the ability to these things but claim they can't and pisses the community off more and more.
---
Very fair point lol I feel dumb.
---
On pc i rarely see a nuke get launched these days. There was an influx when we had to kill scorched but since its been quiet again. I launch one every once in a while just to get something different to do. tbh you should do it at lea
---
I am at the point where I log in, sell three serums, and log out.
---
Before that I did super mutant weapons. Excavator armor with that carry weight mod helped bring hundred of pounds back. This is why we don't see any rifle carry weight reduction perks. They are worth too much at vendors.
---
Boy you don't know anything huh? Xbox subscription is just one of many Microsoft subscriptions. All your subs is in your Microsoft account, not Xbox account.
---
LOL. So this is just a trap:

https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/48732/~/how-do-i-cancel-my-fallout-1st-membership-on-pc%3F

LOL that's completely not what I expected. I have a max level 3* primed Bloodied LMG with limb damage and +1 Perception. I've only seen this behavior on public servers with a bit of lag.
---
I have a 1* Bloodied LMG and a 1* primed Bloodied .50 cal that I've never seen the same damage behavior.
---
Yeah that makes the most sense
---
Oh shit.  That's how I am going to get my High Rad Fluids the next time I have a few weekend hours to myself.
---
-Finish all challenges (Except Daily and Weekly, those doesnt count but are useful for atoms); 
---
-Find all the plans in the game; 
---
-Build a Vault 94 PA; 
---
-Get all the NW rewards from level 1 to 100. 
---
-Get the BoS Elder Paint for the T60. 
---
These are the one Im trying to do. Good luck !

I wonder what kind of collage he's working on.

---
Click "Manage" next to the subscription, big ass red "cancel membership" button.
---
Talk about not understanding datamining and keep spewing the same bullshit over and over, huh?
---
when you have an subscription on xobox you have the option to cancel it via the xbox itself. fallout 1st does not have this option
---
Why do you need all the flux for if i may ask? ive needed some to make jetpacks but not since
---
depends on your level - for example, during a WS run, I'll put on excavator and pickup/loot \*everything\*  : vases, every piece of silverware in the golf club, stuff in the laundry room, everything the critters drop...if its not nailed down, I take it.
---
Then do the outside area @ blackwater.  By that time, I'm at the run/crawl weight limit, which is about 1720#)
---
At the end of the run, goto WS station, scrip the legendaries I don't want, equip hard bargain3 and pop a grape mentats.  
---
Do that 2x, and I've hit cap limit on the day.  
---
If you are a lower level/not ready for WS, then you can do similar around Morgantown, it just takes longer b/c of all the load in/out for the different buildings.  Or just do the airport, trainyard, and in/around mama dolces.  
---
Helvetia is about the same.  Clean the town, then hit the nearby train station.
---
Reply of the year right here folks!
---
Yeah I think if you have that on it takes less materials to repair so you don’t have to use ballistic fiber that’s all I meant! Haven’t needed ballistic fiber in a bit tbh I just stash it all in my box but that could be the armor I use
---
I dont understand why people would pay a monthly fee for an empty box and a jacket. I dont have anything against people buying the game and enjoying it.
---
Broken responder helmets (I guess other pieces too though I only know of it happening to responder helmets) now wearable?
---
It's a bug...
---
While I was wearing a power armor a radroach pushed me off a cliff once.
---
Well, we can’t say they weren’t at least trying to test the update before it going live.
---
Depends whether they were using a cheat engine or not buddy boy. Seems most of you smoothbrains are leaving that part out.
---
This is because most every scheduled maintenance update has been Tuesday mornings (10-1 est roughly. Extended today due to complications)
---
??
---
I haven't and probably never will. I don't have a big enough group that I can freely talk to, I've seen what you have to go through to launch one. I don't like waves of robots lol
---
Maybe in the future but I'm not holding my breath.
---
Need the headset and friends first lol
---
This all started when they made those "fixes" where they overhauled the entire under-the-hood functionality of power armor back in patch 11.  As a whole, that was a disaster of a patch that made the game worse in a number of ways that it has yet to fully recover from.  That was also the patch where they messed with the legendary spawns and made all the melee drops have 50% limb damage. But regarding power armor, first, there was the "fix" that literally no one asked for that caused everyone's power armor pieces to be removed from their frames, and in some cases people lost pieces of their sets.  Then there was the intolerable glitch that persisted for a month or more, where you'd be unable to move when getting out of power armor.  Last was this stupid broken jet pack bug, which as you said has been around for months now.  It's ridiculous, and it all stems from their power armor functionality overhaul.  And what good did the overhaul even do?  I can't see any noticeable difference other than power armor not working right.  We even still have the slenderman bug and frames going down at a 45 degree angle during the entering animation, and frames being offset from the player position as you enter them - it's a mess.
---
Really annoying to only get like two hours in the morning, and waiting around for four hours plus thinking maintaince won't take as  long *this time*.
---
Now its nearly time for unwinding and headed to bed with the missus.
---
In the future, I'm just going to dismiss patch day as lost, when I see it on the twitter feed, and put my effort into progress on another game.
---
Lesson learned,I guess.
---
But at least I'm not the guy on twitter saying that he basic wants FO76 to be the first MMO to require no server maintenance, not played on like that yet, it's a given, no matter how frustrating
---
The tent and private world yeah you lose them. You keep everything else, even your scrap box. You just can't add anything else to your box. So it's worth it just for the one and done of getting rid of your junk in your stash+however much you can farm in a month
---
It's just funny at this point.
---
Gotcha. I was misinformed. Apologies
---
Yeah I sure did. I kept going to armor benches looking to repair and thinking "Hmm... I'm pretty sure I just took a beating but nothing to fix?!?"
---
Civil War Dress and Civil War Suit make 19 - 20 caps per maxed out hard bargain and high charisma.
---
They promised any cosmetic outfit that was in the atom bundles would be purchasable via the atomshop also, yet we can't get elder Maxon outfit, pint sized slasher, etc. Would I be happy with premium users getting more caps and bs? No, but they might as well have. You can scrap at the survival tent, any junk u throw in to the junk box auto scraps. Atleast ESO+ is cheaper than the bullshit cash grab they called Fallout 1st.
---
**Good**: Using your wits and game knowledge to put together a competent PVP build.
---
**Bad**: PVP is just an arms race for raid armor, legacy weapons, quad tesla rifles.
---
**Ugly**: The game is a buggy mess.
---
I didn't like the F4 Mod version but think the Standard one in 76 looks pretty good.
---
Game Files has 9 Variations of the Ranger Armor. Grey (Standard), Riot (Green), and Desert with each of those having a Standard, Advanced, and Elite variant. Datamines show they are likely all 1st Locked content. The Standard Riot Paint just released last week as a free buy in the Atom Shop exclusive to 1st Members.
---
241 and I've launched only 1
---
 He was claiming he was locked into the sub.
---
clownshoes
---
The sub doesn't go into your Xbox account. It goes onto your Microsoft account. Sign into Microsoft.com or Microsoft store and go to account and then manage subscriptions or something. I turned auto renew off the 1st day it came out.
---
"I'm Tom Bodett for Motel 6, and we'll leave the light on for you."

Fixed
---
Lvl 179 and only launched one. Had tons of lag problems and three major fuckups: 
---
1. Couldn't find my way around first step gettng bio key, loading it. Really confusing layout. 
---
2. Hacked computer to by pass the reactor fixes, but again, spent way too much time wandering around looking for the right path. As a result, TONS of not swarms. 
---
3
---
. Couldn't figure out how to properly position nuke launch
---
nch and ended up nuking too big of an area including the drop zone. 
---
Also, those damned cores! I have 13 in my stash for my second try. Need to wait until there are sufficient high lvl folks on to take the SBQ.
---
LMG and Minigun Ultracite Ammo use it, not to mention it's used in shocks for power armour.
---
Gotta have loads of flux for anything endgame really haha
---
I eat the dead people, but chems aren’t as fun when your healing factor cuts the time in half. We just ate a super mutant yesterday, where were you? I can’t kill, without being attacked first, but eating the dead is just recycling
---
There was a weapon called Fancy Single Action Revolver circulating around
---
Before I was forced to take weight reduction perks (because I was too lazy to transfer stuff to an alt) I had all of my Rifleman build maxes out, with all 3 gladiator perks maxed out.  I had no problem switching between rifles and one handed melee 🤷‍♂️
---
Where is the area
---
Makes you wonder why they didn't just make it 2000 pounds so people had to either drop it or not use the character.
---
I tired using my rum bottle halves to pull out a cake I baked... Can't even handle a little heat.
---
Most people farm their steel and rubber etc by getting all of the regular weapons off of mobs. The scrap box doesn't scrap those. Still need some kinda workbench. Also 1 month of F1st is $14 vs ESO+ being $15
---
From Paragraph 2 onwards your entire post is pointless.  Fallout First is included in the Services and Subscriptions section of your Microsoft account. Of which there is a manage button and there is a cancel button within that.  
---
So yeah, good luck taking Bethesda to court. Worst case scenario, a Bethesda lawyer snorts his coffee
---
Well if you start giving back lost items, you would have your support spamed with people faking to loose a oost item, and its not a minecraft server, you dont have the time to go through finding it in the logs in every single cases, its injust for the people that lost their weapons like that, but that may be the only way. What im argueing isnt that Bethesda or Zenimax werent greedy with 76, but its that it isnt that greed that killed the game, as it came far after the game came out.
---
3rd floor area right outside of the elevator. The room directly across from the elevator and then the shower room and the barracks room with the cots at the end of the corridor turning left as you leave the elevator.
---
Any reduction in the RNG will reduce the “Looting/Shooting” cycle. Something like this can’t exist until there is significant end game content.
---
That said, we could get more things like the Scorch Killer plans we get for some weapons from the Responders
---
Fair enough, to each their own. Are they releasing like one variant a month then?
---
Ace Ventura
---
How have they punished loyal players, are you referring to the ones that got banned for using cheat engine to find exploits?
---
&gt;one game every 5 years
---
beats releasing skyrim and fallout games every 2 years and driving them into the ground with each new installment 
---
CDPR has proven track record
---
anyways, enjoy your microtransaction infested, bug filled, subscription oriented MMORPG that lacks basic features such as text chat and anti cheat while providing you max 24 player instances 
---
yes, bethesda has got you covered with its RPG experiences
---
It doesn’t make any sense to launch nukes in a game with a world that was literally nuked to kingdom come 25 years before events of 76. I know it probably has to do with the story but like, still lol. I haven’t launched one though. I’m not even that far in the story. This game has bugged quests too anyway, so it’s not like progression is easy.
---
‘Lack of content’ itself means he already got what he wanted, likely a duped god roll. You see, if someone has no access to duped stuff and rely on farming alone for top end stuff, he wouldn’t complain much about ‘lack of content’, he can farm in WS repeatedly and attempts to get his dream roll. This is what the game designed to do. It’s like a casino slot machine. Do people get ‘new content’ by sitting in front of a slot machine? No they don’t, they repeat the process and always hope the next try will land them a jackpot. Give that person all the money in the world he can dream of, he’ll walk away from the slot machine for lack of ‘content’.
---
no
---
 I’m level 24 and I’ve launched thirteen with a friend so far
---
Unknown what their plans are but yeah im guessing they will trickle them out monthly to keep people subbed.
---
Quiet there, smoothskin.
---
Is the red really cost 100k. It's a pity I have one but as I play male character I don't use it and stock it in my stash... 🙄
---
I think I’ve done that one 3 times. It pops up every time I walk past
---
Seems a little gay to me
---
I hope his collage is a visual journey that represents the spaghetti code that was shoved into this crazy multiplayer Morrowind with guns mod of a game.
---
 You can run a max melee build with a very good rifle/commando on the side. Perception and Strength need to be in the 15 range though.
---
Yeah, I've been waiting and waiting for the camouflage power armor skins to pop up. You'd think skins like that, which are obviously always desirable, would always be available. Or release the military paint finally for that classic OD green look.
---
Got it from liberators too. Not in this area tho.
---
This is completely immersion breaking. I built a jetpack at home in my shed and it works perfectly and never slams me to the ground unexpectedly.
---
"We could remove duped legacies, but you can still dupe them"...thats how I read it anyways.
---
Also ESO didn’t start with a cash shop. It had a mandatory subscription from day 1. The shop came in fairly early but not that early.
---
Yes I saw someone selling the yellow hat but it looked just like the white one to me
---
I havnt seen the b25 with faster reload in a while
---
True, even the Map76 creator used it and wasn't sure if hadn't used it on the banned account. Bethesda just needs to hire some playtesters whose whole purpose is to use cheat engine so they can counter it. Or just implement anti-cheat software.
---
It's probably the most rare outfit in the game.  I've seen people offer legacies for it before.
---
They just tweeted that they’re only able to hot fix 2 things and the rest will have to wait
---
Nossir.  I told you its hidden.  It will never pop up.  Go back and look around again ;)
---
250 dr while reloading fix?  Trade with other players fix?
---
Maybe I can give you some insight as to why I did.
---
I pretty much solely bought the membership for what you call an "empty Box".  That empty Box is now overflowing with scrap and freeing up 400 pounds of space in my stash Box.
---
 The tent camp I've only used a couple times. It does come in handy when you are overburdened and you don't want to drop anything or move your base.
---
 The private server is great if you want to do some grinding and farming for certain items and things without worrying about other people looting it before you get there.
---
 To me a very important reason why I paid $14 a month is I don't buy anything from the Atom shop because none of it really interests me except for the camp stuff.
---
 I want to help this game succeed and I feel my monthly subscription helps that.  
---
 I have played MMO's since 2003 and have always paid a Box price and the subscription fee so 14 bucks a month is actually kind of cheap for me.
---
They log everyone's inventorys, otherwise how else would they track duping? So thusly they can tell who's telling the truth and who isn't when it came to those. Also there's simple things called ctrl+ F which you can then highlight a certain word and it will take you to wherever that word appears so if I put TSE Handmade, that's all they'd have to do.  They wouldn't have so much backlash if they did more for their community.  I'm sorry but when other Triple A games can reproduce your equipment that the game magically decided to take from you. You know how many times I lost shit in WoW and sent a support ticket in about it and manged to get it back within a reasonable time.
---
i dont think we can get any further in the discussion. We seems to disagree - on a fundamental level - about human motivation.
---
I know i lot of people has stopped playing after all the legendary spawn nerfs.   I think bethesda is off wioth the current investment/reward calculation
---
I just turned level 50 and launched my first nuke last night 😁
---
The store owner believes hair styles and emotes are way more important in the wasteland than weapon and armor skins 👌
---
Player vending and then kill the mole miners at Blackwater Mine. Collect everything from them, waddle down the hill to the train station and sell. If you want more xp, cook all the glowing meat. If you are low level you can do it around Morgantown airport and train yard.
---
PS4 here, I have this error.
---
Error during Bethesda.net Login.
---
\[3:0:844424930197533\]
---
 Tell me about your internet connection. My game is fast, smooth and almost flawless most of the time.
---
 A 32" 4k Monitor driven by an RTX 2070 is very nice and I can't get much under 55 FPS anywhere.
---
Troubleshooter’s armor and weapons... lol.  I keep a TrSh Fixer and a few armor pieces in case Encryptid pops up
---
I'm perfectly fine with them taking the snally spit explosions out of my inventory.
---
Ill do some research, and update the post with what i can find about this code. Thank you!
---
I've also never launched a nuke.
---
I waited a long time but finally did one to get my Scout Badge. I even did it manually, Decoded the message and codes myself instead of looking up the codes. Now that ive done it the "Real" way i wont feel bad about just looking up the codes next time.
---
 I had my mid level run a test on the launch sequence in a Hazmat suit, but I've never been back. I should finish the Brotherhood quest too. ;)
---
What hidden quest?
---
Right again, not saying it can’t be don’t. But it’s not optimal and not best in class,  thats still not as powerful melee build as having 15 in strength, all the related perks, and mutations. On the flip side if you moved those 9 points from gladiator into stealth/sneak/sneak attack bonus/vats/escape artist etc. etc. you’d have a more powerful rifle build. 
---
What I’m saying is that there is no way to get maximum optimization if you cross-class with weapons, and there will be things that are more difficult because of it. You can be “good/okay” at both things but never “master” at both. Master meaning full optimization of the weapon class with the most possible damage output and benefits.
---
It was a PC issue
---
Still happens with some bloodied weapons unfortunately too. My bloodied 10mm auto pistol, bloodied pump shotgun and bloodied minigun all rubberband damage like crazy. The 10mm is the worst. I'll empty 15 rounds into a creature, doing 300-400 damage a hit, itll go down to zero quick than up to 75% or so, had to stop using it cause it wasted too much ammo never counting hits.
---
Cripple their legs, watch them crawl.
---
I don't see a paywall in there, so it's out!
---
No it takes long because they found new issue when fixing old ones and they have no idea what to do.
---
It's a pretty nice way to grind some XP. Plus you get an achievement for launching a nuke (on xbone anyway) Probably the only positives honestly.
---
Otherwise you lose almost 90% of your ammo reserves.
---
I'm almost a 200 and have never launched a Nuke nor have I played any of the story missions. The game is so broken I figured it wasn't worth my time getting invested into the story and dropping nukes.
---
The chest is the weak spot not the head.
---
yeah but i have a sneak build i cant use TS weapons with that. if i dont use instigating i wont insta kill them. the issue is farming TS armor that gives +1 strength. i always get garbage  1 star werapons and armor. even on the private server i get bottom of the barrel stuff
---
*There
---
please do share ,thats the whole purpose of this thread
---
*Great
---
This is the salient point in all of this. This is supposedly a AAA studio, yet continually turn out worse code than small indie devs, even solo app writers. On an outdated engine they've been using for decades....yet STILL cannot get anything right. It's quite literally pathetic. The worst part, is that since they're still making money, and people still play, they're not going to change for the better. They have no need too...minimal investment in garbage product = $$$$$, so why even try to develop a decent game when garbage sells?
---
Let's not mention the fact they are banning people who are finding out about exploits, testing it, and then reporting it to Bethesda right after so they have a through detailed analysis of how this exploit happens. But yeah the "community" is whats killing this game, not them being greedy and pissing off their fan base at all.
---
Yeah there’s no confirmed drops just the guys on PC that got it from the dev room. Upsetting because those super rare masks are the coolest things in the entire game &amp; Xbox will never get it lol :-/
---
Kinda off topic but what is the best way to level up fast?
---
Thank you, it's all working now
---
Aim to the torso. Headshots doesn't work with robots
---
Right, but neither will be optimal or master level, just good. By spending your special points that way you are surrendering a lot of complimentary perk cards in agility, luck, endurance etc. that could make the build a lot more powerful.
---
Aim for the weak spot, guts lower chest section.
---
This happened to me on PS4, as well. Loaded into a match to receive about twenty hits all at once and literally every crate anywhere near me already looted as two characters, one in marine armor, already trying to shoot me to death.
---
Level 70, been playing since the beta, I've never launched one.
---
Fallout 76 is the perfect game for you, but it's not the perfect game, not by a looong shot.
---
We only need 20 people for a match ,so i am fine with that :) 
---
Why a ban wave though? why can't they just implement an anti cheat software ?
---
Nobody ever said it was the community. They probably just banned everyone that used the exploit without checking. Hoping for the dude to get unbanned tho.
---
I run a 15S/15P/4E/1C/5I/15A/1L build.  Sneaky VATS rifles and quick one handed melees.  The only way I could get more out of either side would be food/drink/chem/armor upgrades lol.
---
Do you want to go find out for yourself or do you want me to spoil it?  You can also just look it up I spose lol.
---
It looks like even Bethesda has given up, for a greedy company they sure don't know how to make money, waiting to drop some money on some PA skins (that aren't just a paint), this is just fucking awful.
---
Depends on your level. A Combat Shotgun with the Enforcer card at max rank will allow you to easily cripple their limbs and then finish them off (maybe even with a melee weapon if you have the time).
---
A Suppressed Automatic Combat Rifle with all Commando cards is good if you want to snipe.
---
A .50 Cal with all max Heavy Weapons cards will outright kill them.
---
Kill legendary enemies for better weapons and armor.
---
I do like some wallpapers
---
The kind of updates I'm here for 👌
---
ESO is like 5 1/2 years old now. ESO was mandatory subscription at launch, added the cash shop later when subs dried up because content was coming out too slowly and wasn’t pleasing people who had gone through the main quest. There were tons of issues with PvP (and still are depending on who you ask).
---
Sound familiar?
---
Fallout 76 is having it’s first birthday on Thursday. Total disaster is extreme hyperbole. Growing pains is more accurate. I do hope we never see Atom gambling crates though. Those are vile.
---
thank you
---
I like the new wallpapers though
---
I get ya!  
---
I was returning technical data and a radroach follows me into the basement. opens the door casually, like hey man s'up.
---
Yay, the Plague Doctor mask came back!
---
One of the few items I regretted missing out on, only because I wasn't aware it was a time-limited deal when it came out.
---
Level 131. I haven’t but I want to.  I’d probably need someone to walkthrough with me. If anyone on PS4 is interested let me know.  Ha!
---
75k if you could even buy it for caps value. I think more in the 125k realm would need to buy it for caps.
---
What happened to all the datamined Free States armor skins from way before all the rest of the Free States atom store bundles?  I want more skins for my armor pieces!
---
Huh? You don't want blue paint for $18???
---
yes but happening on other weapons as well
---
I'm only level 55, but I've never launched a nuke
---
I just don't see how they couldn't have 1 person make like 50+ wallpapers in one day and then have a giant pack. 800 atoms for 3 meh papers is like, what do you do all day?
---
With you in this, so glad I've been grinding out atoms for something like this, well...I say grinding more like trying to complete everything in Fallout haha
---
I only launched a nuke to get the achievement haha.
---
Lead them to someone else.
---
Those plague skins, the liberty prime one, ones like those actually worth it, those basic colour paint jobs should be available from vendors in-game imo.
---
Maybe they mean things like the snally spit attack item and such things...
---
no adrenal reaction did not add it yet wanted to see what kind of damage without before adding
---
The house I grew up in had a wall with carpet on it.
---
Thanks for posting this!! Nothing super special but looks like a couple things I might go ahead and grab. Been waiting on the mole costume to go on sale. 10% off isn’t much of a deal.
---
&gt;That said, we could get more things like the Scorch Killer plans we get for some weapons from the Re
---
They could paywall a legendary crafting bench....  "damn don't give ideas Noob".......Sorry, my bad
---
Damn. That would be....... challenging.
---
shoot (off) the legs
---
that way they cant melee you anymore and have to use their headlaser
---
50 in a day would be an insane amount of work not humanly possible. You underestimate the work that goes into even one.
---
That's completely incorrect.  In fact the fastest way to take out Mr. Gutsys is with eyestalk hits
---
140, nope
---
umm....what?
---
IIRC, yes, twisted muscles give a great melee bonus, but at the cost of something like a 50% accuracy loss on ballistic weapons.  Granted, class freak reduces that, but still....
---
Fantastic!
---
You can get it from liberators in the forest, but I think it's just the "bladed plan", or something like it. Allows you to apply the "bladed" mod to more than 1 weapon.
---
You can also get the commie whacker plan from the liberators, I've gotten 2 around Tyler fairgrounds.
---
I think those are just a "country" decoration 
---
--someone who lives in the south
---
When you report someone, remember to block them. Also this is why I keep shadowplay going, so I can save the match at the end and upload it to youtube and update the ticket with it.
---
Should be asking how to do more damage
---
the legs seem to be unarmoured. the head and torso are difficult to do damage to
---
Yeah I've made custom wallpapers for Fallout 4 before, a lot of work goes into one.
---
They restore it if you have Fallout 1st.
---
I’m level 127 and I haven’t launched one yet.
---
Ive got 3 different Handmade's i cycle between (TS FFR Faster Reload, TSE, and my newest addition Furious More Damage While Aiming) and would absolutely love to be able to tell them apart by painting them but i missed the two Handmade Paints previously. Heck even flat colors like the Red, Green, Blue Power Armor paints they just released i would be happy with.
---
I have a level 90something and a level 50something and yeah Ive never gotten around to it
---
Stealth boys take all the armor stats and throw them out the window. It has it's own value for stealth. I learned this in the survival servers way back.
---
it's garbage. I've got £30 loaded onto psn waiting for something interesting to buy on the atom store and absolutely nothing on there is doing it for me
---
&gt; can I switch character's on a private world and workshops would still be built up for the 10-15 minutes?
---
No, the world is linked to your account, but the workshops are tied to the character who claimed them.
---
Totally understand man. To me just off the batt you’re missing out on a 30% AP Refresh and 20% Damage resistance without lone wanderer. A 15% damage bonus without bloody mess, and mutation benefits (which are astounding) without starched genes by cross classing that way. 
---
To me way easier and more fun to optimize one thing and then just have a weapon of a different class for low level trash without any perks in it once you get higher lvl.
---
Good thing I don't use them then.
---
Great*
---
I doubt its hard for them to add a wallpaper, a couple of hours at most.
---
damn, swing and a miss.
---
You are in Luck. Forest Camo Power Armor Paint is in the shop today. - https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dvej4k/atom_shop_update_nov_12th_for_those_at_work_rn/
---
Every weapon in every game is either a stick or a shooter, so I’m not sure what you’re getting at here.
---
Or you know, give us an ugly one for free because it introduced a new mechanic to the game.
---
 Did max melee build just go right by you? I don't think you have built an end game char from what you have said.
---
A few, sure, but 50? that would take weeks.
---
Very anemic these past few weeks. I'd bet that their Atom Shop releases were all tied to Wastelanders for a while and they had nothing else to put out when it was delayed
---
You're missing the numbers point. If Fallout 76 loses players to a ban wave it will hurt the entire game at this point. As for your second question, probably because they cannot fix their own issues, let alone code something that will stop people that clearly know their coding better than they do, from cheating outside of an outright ban.
---
I guess some year they will get to actually adding content once they fix the broken content.  Yeah, that's the ticket.
---
The idea itself is not a reduction in RNG, first u gotta get the plan, then u gotta get the random materials which can be RNG if you want.  I'm level 473 and I have every god tier thing i could ever want.  But you want to just randomly kill things 3\*\*\* for 1 star rewards?
---
50 is extreme but I bet it's just a case of sizing the photo and adding it onto the frame, done.
---
I just want the stackable power supplies to be back. Fuck me right?
---
I wanted solid PA paints for a while, but even in spite of them being Atomic Shop, I never bought them because I don't care much for the colors they chose.  For the price and simplicity, you'd think they'd have a much wider selection.
---
Lackluster as fuck. Even the Atom shop is starting to suffer from the content drought this game is going through.
---
 Which does nothing to my accuracy as I have never used VATS. I pull off max range headshots with a Short Scope all the time. I always run Twisted Muscles and after much testing I dumped Class Freak.
---
....because it's the best way to scatter roaches.
---
Ya I pretty much only run JE/JFFR Railways. It's insane how much damage you can put out before depleting your AP bar.
---
u can found it for cheap these days
---
the game is worth it's 50hs... after that there isn't much to do but we farm legendary weapons, sell things to other players, decorate the house until new content or event drops.
---
Unless you're very well-prepared or have an OP legendary weapon I wouldn't recommend doing it on your own
---
Not if you're just reusing the same normal and specular maps. This should be like, import 50 clip art backgrounds, save out in slight variations with \~4 sets of normal/spec maps.
---
It's almost like one of those things is entirely different from the other.
---
Legendary crafting would be great content, buy I doubt they could implement it well.
---
Aaaaaaaaaaaalrighty then.
---
If you enjoy fallout games you will enjoy 76.
---
So have I, took 5 minutes to save a diffuse map and reuse one of the normal and spec map pairs.
---
I seee sooo many people talking shit, but then I say one word and people ATTACK MEEE, this community is a little toxic, but those who shine light in the darkness shine bright.
---
Cue all the complaints form kiddos who's mom won't increase their allowance ....
---
does he though?  the real work is just the integration into game files  from the asset
---
the  actual ART part of it, the creation of the colors/design, is super easy. 50 a day for random patterns and colors? easy.
---
When they discover a bug, they don't detail it much to keep people from using that information to come up with other (similar) bugs.
---
The stripes one is available outside of the bundle, but my thing is that I don't care for the bundling.  There's often, to me, one good choice and two mediocre ones, but you pay for all of them.  If they're going to do bundles, I'd rather have them themed.  Like, here's a pack of solids.  Here's a pack of wood paneling, etc.  Not stripes, weird geometric pattern, weird 1970s pattern, etc.
---
I've only launched 2...But I've always wondered why I don't get experience for the mobs I kill with the nuke? Do I have to actually be in the vicinity of the mobs when the nuke lands or what?
---
Fallout 76 price is always on black Friday. You can find it at very low price. It becomes more or less a F2P.
---
And yes you should give it a try if you like open world. The map is really huge and some POI really beautiful.
---
Wishful thinking they aren't gonna give us anything
---
Funny enough, the camouflage PA skin actually popped back up today!
---
I don't expect modding to ever be available to private servers. It's proven again, and again, that there are lot of immoral people more than willing to abuse it. 
---
I do hope they add options to the servers that would allow us to "toggle" options, like turning pacifist off, or removing legendary effects/VATS, or increase the level caps on mobs.
---
Idgaf about the rewards I haven't played in months but I can still see your little shit goat boi
---
Why would you play if it wasn’t fun?
---
I'm still disappointed that you can't display Giddyup Buttercups.
---
So far they only removed the thirst zapper and acid soaker.
---
I’ll need to check but they may have also removed the paintball gun.
---
Nothing else has been removed.
---
Even without those things, max base Agility, full Unyielding, and both Sneak and the perk that makes them lose you when you crouch will still leave you in danger over half of the time. The only way to fix it is to leave the area, entirely, then return or to leave the server.
---
Even when you're not in danger there is a suspiciously high number of times where you'll have the enemies, "randomly shoot," exactly where you are even after you moved from where you last popped a shot off.
---
I don't think that analogy quite works, but I believe I get what you mean by the blindfold, no logs.
---
I'm also a dev, and that's how at least a few games do it for their private servers, it's not *that* bad. You would obviously need to get server logs too in order to debug your mod, which is easy enough for them to provide.
---
Full access is just complete overkill and they're never going to do that. 
---
Well, now that I think about it, I assume you mean like access to the debug console and not like, root access to the virtual server running the actual private world, right? That's what I thought you meant at first, which is why I said what I did. As far as that, I think it's unlikely, but it would definitely make things a hell of a lot easier to have the debug console. How that would work on 76 compared to 4, I have no clue. The engine has to be some sort of Frankenstein's monster at this point. 
---
I wonder if they might make up some sort of private server for devs, that let's you test mods and such with the debug console enabled, but somehow prevents you from just playing on it. Maybe your character doesn't save or something.
---
It’s still around, you on PC?
---
I've played off and on since beta, and I've never launched one. I can't be assed to get through the convoluted main quest to do it, so I never have.
---
I was reading elsewhere the negative effect is more apparent when using hipfire as opposed to sighted/scoped - perhaps that's the difference?
---
 (I have hesitated/resisted the mutation b/c I do use ballistics against things that fly.)
---
I've compared all mods and their accuracy affects on SGs with a friend that uses a lot of them, best we could get on a Pump was 64, but the Combat SG will get to 72 and significantly better range, even with a suppressor.
---
Not gonna even touch that free icon...…. wtf bethfesda
---
Damn how do you explain this to an idiot? Oh wait
---
... You don't.
---
Wut! Awesome news and much appreciated, sir!
---
I'm level 269 (nice) and I've launched 2 nukes: One at level 100 (technically like 102 or 103) and level 200 (probably like 203 or something).
---
The first time I did it to "finish" the main quest. I went in loaded for bear with thousands of rounds of ammo and like 50 stimpaks cuz I had always heard the silo run was designed for a fully leveled team of 4 in power armor and 3/* legendary heavy weapons and I'm (well, was) a full-time solo stealth rifleman. Then I finally did it and I was like... that's it? I mean sure it's long and tedious and if you're not paying attention you'll get your ass handed to you, but it wasn't _that_ bad. Launched the nuke, killed the queen, got my shitty 2/* legendary combat armor left leg and all was right with the world.
---
Then around level 200 the possum scout backpack badge challenges quest came out and one of the badges requires you to launch a nuke. So I just decided one night to launch another nuke and didn't really plan for it. I probably should have cuz I died a bunch and then ran out of radaway cuz I forgot you soak up a ton of rads in this one spot about 2/3 the way through. But I persevered and launched another nuke. I fought the queen (which I almost missed out on b/c for some reason the fast travel system decided not to work for some reason) got my shitty 2/* combat armor and my possum badge and all was right with the world. 
---
I fully expect there to be when Wastleanders comes out (probably around the time I hit level 300) to be another mission to end that chapter with you wither nuking the Raiders settlement or the Settlers settlement and that'll probably be my third nuke launch. So that's something to look forward to, I guess.
---
Isn't it, my friends and I launch numerous times a day!
---
The event actually started early. It was active around 8PM on the 28th, I think they just started the timer too early, on the 28th, instead of the 29th. Would explain why it stopped a day early, as well.
---
Yeah, Bethesda introduces a popular new subscription model that gives you atoms each month and then promptly stops adding new stuff to the atom shop so there's nothing to buy with them. That's a really bad way to get people to keep subscribing. They're gonna have a huge drop-off after that first month if they keep this up. Either they are all hands on deck for Wastelanders or they've cut back hardcore on manpower hours for the game or both. Either one does not bode well.
---
FWIW, their combat inhibitors seem to be their weak points.  I usually snipe for those via VATS.  It does take me couple hits, but I'm using a rifle build.  I'd assume, with the usual melee weapon damage output and instigating, that you could one-punch it there.
---
They break still. I can confirm it.
---
They’re just weaker and heavier versions of normal things
---
as long as they are working on wastelanders proper
---
How do I activate battle bots?
---
It also looks like from the skin pack for laser weapons that the ranger armor is getting an elite variant. I'm sure it was confirmed elsewhere from data miners. Just surprised to see it but no actual ability to purchase.
---
Congrats on bragging about your disposable income
---
Yeah it is in the vault simulation area.
---
Lmao I barely found out how my flash light works 😂😩💀
---
I’ll check on the paintball gun but none of that other stuff has been removed.
---
The only reason they aren't the same is because they said so, which is absolute bullshit there is no difference between them they just want to milk fans for extra money.
---
At level 7
---
Ah I see. Not sure what the huge issue with it is then. Maybe just the fact that it’s an exploit but now that I think about it someone swore they saw a nuke briefcase at someone’s camp not too long ago but still no function in Adventure mode
---
Yeah seriously, I feel like I can basically mow down anything in the game but I have more trouble with assaultrons than with scorchbeasts
---
I hope for server options comparable to admin tools. So that server admins can control rules! But I too share the same opinion that we will never see mods come to Fo76 except for a creation club style approach!
---
Monster mask hasn’t been removed. Still have mine.
---
Was mainly aiming at dr and er, and max stealth too. Sorry never stacked 5 wood shrouded. Only 2 in tests and I only have 7 agil. But I was looking for max stealth with dense chest and still have over 300 dr/er, ended up with around 350ish. Muffled, saw no gains but ultra light on the rest was good. Sleek and wood stealth move didn't seem to move my guy any faster either. Chameleon works great with all 5. I'd run one or 5, like unyielding + 1 cham.
---
Is it perhaps just a visual bug?
---
The 'wastelanders' update coming first-quarter next year is also gonna bring back human NPCs so there will definitely be a more social aspect to it going on from there as well. Id imagine these NPC places will become hot spots for grouping and trading, but you never know what people will make of it, if they wanna find something wrong with something, they will lol
---
And now it keep crashing at signing in.
---
Even things like a bucket or a house lamp?
---
Any specific websites to find it at for a cheap price
---
It's roughly 3% XP per point of Intelligence.
---
Where. The goddamned fuck. IS THE OPOSSUM HAT. THATS ALL I WANT. AAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
---
If I can't have mosaic floors, I shall make mosaic walls instead.
---
Cant display a chainsaw. There went my logger themed camp idea. Q.Q
---
188 and the first nuke i ever launched I nuked myself. there I was stand buck naked except for my draws on top of the Mothman Museum and.....BLAMO!!!  
---
Why nuke the Mothman? Cause fuck him that's why!
---
Legacies?
---
Did you see this in your pip boy?
---
It’s still here, hasn’t been removed.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
Will have to add to my route
---
Those are untouched.
---
Him, hope not I have about 1000 scrip and 8 possum badges, that would suck.
---
Level 80 and launched 6 nukes
---
Tried 3 times and crashed less than a minute from hitting the launch button.  I have quit trying.
---
If this occurred widely, batten down the hatches. I feel a shit storm brewing.
---
Exactly, thats one of the junk items id like to be able to place, even if you have to place them on furniture to avoid all the terrain/landscape glitches that would insue, you could always throw a rug down and then place your giddyup on the rug if they made it that way
---
Energy weapons with the Explosive effect, they're commonly referred to as "legacy" weapons because they don't drop anymore, are really powerful, and worth a lot.
---
Last time they did that they gave a heads up, I’d expect the same if they were going to do it again, you should be fine if you only have one copy of a duped item.
---
Rad Victoriam!
---
Tried twice. Gonna do it some day before wastelanders. Need it for the platinum trophy on ps4 anyway
---
What's worse is they add stuff and then forget to put it on the sale/new screens.
---
Last week there were some nuka cola lights and all the red rocket stuff was pieced out of the bundle for sale and not a word of it on the sale screens, you had to dig through the store to find it all.

I made a mad dash last minute to gather up 500 atoms from some incomplete challenges to grab those nuka cola lights before they were gone. They didn't even mention in the listing that the lights project the logo on the wall  when set to twinkle... which you think would be a major selling point because it looks awesome.
---
Raise your charisma to 6 and intelligence to 5. You'll start getting good drops and even get awarded Legendaries occasionally at silly events like dross toss.
---
Lol no I just started this game and it’s a bit of pain in the ass but it’s kinda fun. I like getting pistol whipped by mutant ghouls while mutant rats bite the back of my Ankle as I try to find out where that random damage is coming from because I can’t see it anywhere around me until I look at the floor 😊😊😊....... in shorter words, no, no I have not launched a nuke and it won’t be for a very long time.........
---
It’s a visual bug, happens all the time. Check your scrip at a machine 👍
---
There's so much QOL you could add to your camp by being able to free-place items and junk
---
To add to this there are notes at most of the Train Stations tacked onto the SheepSquach Posters that have Quests that will trigger when you read them. Also Cryptid Hunter Monthly (C.H. Monthly) around the game world also can trigger new quests.
---
or grab all weapons / junk and sell that
---
It’s probably just the glitch it happens to me every other day where my collections go to zero but if you go to the possum or legendary vendor it should all be back.
---
I have 0 Overseer Tickets, yes.  Everything else looks normal though, including Badges and Scrip.
---
This might be a display thing - I seem to recall in the last patch, there was something bugged about the Collections screen.
---
I did the same, in general much more useful.
---
Comment under radded
---
My script was there. But nothing on the pipboy. If you go to a script machine it was there. Not sure on badges. Maybe check a machine for the badges.
---
Entitled much? Kids these days are so entitled, if you tracked bugs you would know bug fixes take 7-12months so your checking way too early unless its atomic shop then its fixed within 20mins.
---
Troubleshooters anything works.  Most gatlings work, as does anything AA.  
---
During Mischief Night, I used a plain old gatling plasma on them.
---
Events and quests are funnest/slowestish
---
Just straight grind, super mutant camps, scorch camps, that one tunnel between the ash heap and cranberry bog, and always have a rest buff and food xp buff (canned stew, etc)
---
Awesome news. Thanks!
---
I'll add server hop! Clear and area and load a new server to refresh the enemies
---
Absolutely mannequins would be awesome also being able to set items randomly within you camp would be incredible. Beer on the table magazines on the side table butter cup on the ground.
---
Try to crip soemthing, a lots of game have those bugs and getting one usually fix it, hope it workk for you
---
Old Winter Winter Man Mask wasn't in the dev room. Hundreds if not thousands of players have it because it dropped and was duped.
---

---
you can kill them with an auto Tesla. It doesn't have to be legendary but you must have Commando 1,2, and 3. A couple of shots from a railway rifle will do it too. Robots have a resistance to explosions. Always aim for her legs and then if she crawls aim for that torso. Her head has more armor than the rest of her. she'll die faster if you shoot her body. The quickest way if you don't have any options above is either two pulse mines or pulse grenades. She'll die in instantly.
---
true. im level 190 and mostly melee and never make bullets or have anything ultracite lol 
---
i always like meeting people that play the game completely different tho. thats why i asked. :) 
---
always wondered why some people nuke the weirdest spots
---
Ight, I’ll keep it pushing. I am 33 now by just waxing a ton of mutants and mirelurks🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Thanks! I got scared and posted, should've checked the machines before saying anything cause it's all there.
---
paintball gun is gone
---
Not talking about the Winter mask... I know that’s everywhere. I’m talking about the Skull, Goblin &amp; Jester masks that were accessible through the dev room on PC
---
That was one of the few things. It wasn't just the cleavers. There at least 6 items this worked on that I saw. Probably more.
---
It needs to be made seamless too. Also it isnt just a photo...
---
This whole time...thanks fir filling me me in kind soul!
---
I hope they do something like this. Looting is fun, but so is crafting. There's nothing to craft because you've got to rely on the legendary effects, which are only found through looting or trade.
---
Me. Never
---
 Me too, they work just fine. I hunt Scorchbeasts for food. ;)
---
Nice find, but I think my theory is that you found Bethesda’s office.
---
The amateur pack looks nice all sadly I don’t use energy weapons.
---
If you can find a bloodied sniper rifle, like level 10 or something. That will take you to 50, you can hunt the bog over and over. With survival it was easier because of the 20% xp bonus. Set up a camp down there with a sleeping bag and cooking station, place to scrap. Nothing fancy because it will get leveled. The cranberries are in the grove. You can stick the sleeping bag on top of one of the shacks too.
---
No you dont, have a second player in your group. Leave the game thru force close, come back and play with team. The entire area (plants sometimes) will force spawn. I do this in whitesprings EVERY time I launch a nuke, nice to leave with about 25+ legendaries before the nukes up
---
Dailies are good sources of XP since they buffed their rewards a while ago. At your level you probably can do the Forest, Toxic Valley, and Ash Heap dailies really easily.
---
Otherwise I find it best to come up with a XP building route that passes through areas densely populated with enemies - ideally Super Mutants.
---
At your level you probably don't have the recipe for Cranberry Relish but you can easily get Cranberry Cobbler for the 5% XP boost. Always make sure you're Well Rested and boost your Intelligence as high as possible (Brain Fungus Soup, etc.). Full Unyielding helps with this but you probably don't have a set at your level.
---
Easy
---
My tsewr gatling laser and fe Cryolator survived
---
Nah, just a visual bug. I checked machines and all my stuff is there. I got trigger happy with the posting!
---
Good thing the robots kept it busy, they seem to know if you're hiding in the station and still can hurt you through the walls... one followed me without me knowing somehow and had me somewhat trapped.  So can the bloody mothman, I couldn't FT away while hiding in a building once because he'd hit me before the 15 second counter was up.  Then I remembered he doesn't go too high, managed to get on the roof of the building, and was able to pick him off after quite a while.  Not an advisable strategy for Scorchy at that level, though.
---
That's what happens when they outsource support to staff who haven't even played 76 so they would have no idea what's what.
---
No worries, scared the shit out of me the first time too lol
---
Been playing since beta and never have.
---
That just wounds them for me. Instead, I aim for the thruster and it's downed quickly.
---
Launched a nuke once, just so I could finish the story. Did it solo, spent a ton of ammo, after I left the silo some guys were camping trying to kill me, overencumbered, I managed to run away. When I arrived at the site I nuked, the server disconnected right after. Fun times.
---
Wallpapers yaay. I was really hoping for some new floors this week though :(
---
Choose one in the atom shop you all ready own.
---
Do 50 then. Ill wait.
---
I think what you mean by "load zone" is the game has to load the level. No, it's not inside a load zone. It's just a quest mostly for newbies where you collect all the ingredients for the food and once you get them all you can start the food processing machine. During this time, you're inundated with wave after wave of Liberators. I think this would be cool if it worked in a nuke zone because the liberators would be higher level.
---
What are you still doing in this subreddit?
---
Also, if you could have shelves like the ones behind bars to store and display your liquor or nuka cola(s) variants maybe? And if you could get different kinds of robots to be your vendors for you. Instead of players always just having to interact with the others' vending machines.
---
Your loading screens pull from your photo mode pics. Jus delete the old one, and take a new one if it bugs you. :)
---
Shall I call the Waaambulance for you ?
---
I don’t think you know what an optimized end game build is from what you said. I have two end game melee build characters (both above 150) and two end game Rifle characters (both above 150). An optimized max melee build is more than just all the points in the weapon cards. It’s also maximizing strength, not just the full 15 in strength but also other perks that increase strength (ie: solar powered) etc. the swing speed bonuses, penetration bonuses, mutations, cards to hold and lessen the negative effects of those mutations, overall damage increase bonuses suck as 3 points in the bloody mess perk card, damage multipliers such as adrenaline in agility etc. etc.
---
To be fair, if it was the actually developers' decision and not a higher up im sure everything would be better as actual devs are generally very passionate about what they make, but now every publisher out there is being extremely greedy and a lot of them have hopefully learned it's not going to fly anymore. Ubisoft learned with breakpoint, EA learned (hopefully) from anthem, and im sure Bethesda softworks/ zenimax learned from 76. And the outer worlds couldn't have launched at a better time as it shows you don't need to monetize your game into the ground to make money from it.
---
Mtx is there to increase the $, cash cow. It’s hard to compare fo76 with anything really, it’s performing really bad, patches that fix a small % of the problem and even create new ones. Now they just need more money.
---
They're downvoting because just the mention of it hurts their feelings and their mom told them the world was rainbows and sunshine and if you ~~work hard and persist~~ try your best you will be given everything you ~~deserve~~  feel you are owed.
---
In the game world, open the map and and then main menu, photo gallery. There is an option to make a picture from the photo gallery your character's profile pic.
---
Thirst zapper and acid soaker? Care to elaborate? Never heard of these
---
Just Launched My First Nuke Like A Two Weeks Ago At Level 40ish
---
Same it was confusing AF. It only ended when one of our guys died in last cirlce
---
So, in Hitman... I think it was contracts.... there was a dog in the level that if you killed a person while the dog was present, it would start opening doors and go "report" the crime to other npcs. I wish I could find the video because it was hilarious to see the dog stand in front of the door, and basically telekinetically open the doors. 
---
In a similar twist, one of the bugs Skyrim had early on was chickens being witnesses to crimes and reporting them to npcs. It was supposedly quite hard to pin down because no one expects the chicken to be flagged to do that. In the end though, they are just actors to the game engine.
---
There was only one period of console superiority to PCs, and that was the beginning of the ps360 Era, for almost a year console games had better graphics and interactivity.
---
But that was also the last true console generation.
---
Are these weapons really powerfull? Because current energy weapons are not great right?
---
Not the fridge. It only holds 15 items and they don't stack. The collectron is great because it's like having a junk pile everywhere you set up camp.
---
Haha I’m still in game waiting to see what happens 😅
---
Did your team get first tho?
---
Hoorayy
---
It got patched today sadly.
---
How do the ninja turtles talk?
---
Reduce their health to zero while keeping your health above zero.
---
Those people that dont make it to the bottom though o.O lol
---
besides the flux/queen fight, the silo itself gets you tons of steel, lead, fusion cells, and ballistic fiber.. plus it's easily done alone
---
This post has ruined the game and video games forever.
---
I've got three fridges set up and I can store 45 items altogether!
---
I'm a long-time fallout fan as well, but the other fallout games aren't multiplayer, so I don't expect interaction with humans. However, they have NPCs. So by that, you get a lot of talking. You also get radio hosts. There's voices that bring more life to the game and you hear them all the time.
---
 FO76 is a multiplayer game. So that, right off the bat, means I expect human interaction whether it is a Fallout game or not. On top of that, there's hardly and variation of noise in this game. Super Mutants all sound the same, Scorched all sound the same, and frankly the only unique dialogue is the holotapes (but those are short af). Of course there's robots but, like.... That barely counts. (Also Rose or whatever is the most annoying character on Earth.) 
---
I just really wish people would talk. I get tired of the radio songs once I know them all by heart, and that's really the only kinda entertainment I get when exploring. 
---
Also people who eat into the mic are disgusting and need to use Push-To-Talk. Like, seriously, learn some etiquette.
---
Energy weapons in general are kind of weak, but legacies with Explosive on them are stupidly powerful.  For example, you can put a beam splitter on a laser rifle to make it fire 4 explosive shots instead of one, and it basically turns into a long range automatic shotgun rifle that melts everything.  Explosive Gatling Plasmas are also ridiculously strong.
---
Resourceful
---
And again, that us not any one's fault but your own. Sucks, but its true.
---
Same level, 1 nuke. Wasnt worth it.
---
To the window ! To the wall!
---
Does launching a nuke, “aggress” anyone in the nuke zone. Or at ground zero?
---
buckets are steel. 
---
Lamps are copper
---
You need steel to make just about everything, 
---
And plastic for plasma cores and shotgun shells.
---
It happens to me as well.  But frankly I find it no big deal.  Sometimes  I jump higher than I intended to - whoop-de-doo.  I just learned to start off with a quick flick of my jump button for short jumps and 80% of the time that works fine.  
---
The JP has never locked up or slammed me to the ground on the PC so I don't know what's up with that on your end
---
Spend 500 atoms on the sweet, sweet Plague Doctor mask. That's the only correct answer.
---
This is both new and original.
---
Not.
---
They seriously need an in-game chat. Everyone knows this. I would mod it, but I don't think it'll be worth it since I doubt many people even have the mod and I'm technologically incompetent. 
---
Don't you think it would be cool to have some sort of pip-boy related communication? Like a text HUD that you can toggle to be on-screen always or on the pip-boy. 
---
Idk maybe it's just me but that seems cool.
---
Quite.
---
On the Collectron if you have any interest in the other styles wait. Base version is just the standard Protectron look (with random standard colors - yellow, brown, tan, white, etc) but Datamines show a Raider and Communist version are in the Atom files but haven't released yet. Those are likely to be Full Stand Alone options and not Paints so will be the same price as the Plain ones.
---
All jokes aside, they patched out more benefits than problems.
---
How dare you!
---
Just wanted to get in there before the hate brigade posts basically the same thing.
---
*slow clap of approval while groaning for the pun*
---
Most of the top players on Xbox are adults in their 20s and 30s, for the most part. There are younger players with raw talent, but they are less consistent.
---
For example, if one of my younger friends is coming at you by himself, he will likely attack you head-on with overwhelming force, kill you, and either get killed by your teammates or run away.
---
If I was coming at you by myself, I would quickly take you down, but leave you to bleed out, acting as if I ran away. I would instead be circling back, giving your team enough time to take the bait and feel safe. When one of them goes to revive you while the other two guard, I would take out the biggest threat, then take down the guy reviving you, then take out the last player. As soon as the last player is dead, all 4 of you are dead. Only 1 of you would have had a chance to fight back, and that was the one I decided was the least capable of fighting back during the revive.
---
No it's alright but thanks for showing concern. You might want to for the poster who deleted their comment, though
---
Turning shadow distance to low helps a lot. It's the most vram intensive thing in the settings.
---
Must have something to do with my communist salute disappearing:/
---
This is where I was with the Plague Doctor Mask for a long time.  Hopefully, they'll bring back your Opossum Hat too.
---
The good: community, very cool quests, player vending, fun seasonal events, challenging vault raids, good BR, perfect DLC wave (WA), weekly free items in the shop, fun new weapons, a huge amount of stuff to collect, fun with friends, private servers
---
The bad: community, lack of side quests, shitty events, cheats, lag and server stability, bad monetization, lacklustre DLC wave (NW), delayed wastelanders
---
The ugly: me
---
You have to do the tadpole challenges to be able to get the higher level one I believe
---
It apperently collects wins as well or something.
---
Save it for limited time bundles that have exclusives in them. I personally am not spending any atoms ever again until the mr fuzzy jumpsuit comes back around.
---
**Good**:  I really enjoyed building houses, up to my final "Home".  So many options, it was awesome.  
---
**Bad**:  Uh....  Just go check out Youtube, so much info on what's not so great.  The game is a hot mess and so is their management of it and the community.  
---
**Ugly**:  This game has maimed Bethesdas reputation permanently until major leadership changes are made over there.
---
- You get roughly 3% XP per point of Intelligence, so boost it as high as you can with perks, consumables, Unyielding armor, etc.
---
- Sleep in a bed for Well Rested to get 5% extra XP for 2 hours
---
- Do the "Path to Enlightenment" event when it pops up for another 5% XP boost for an hour
---
- Eat some Cranberry Relish for 10% more bonus XP for an hour.  Plant some gourds in your camp, gather up some cranberries around the Bog, and craft some sugar from the snaptail reeds along the river near Flatwoods.  Alternatively you can just cook cranberries to get Cranberry Cobbler for 5% XP for an hour.
---
Then just go to popular farming locations and kill everything there.  If you keep farming legendaries you'll eventually get something decent that's worth selling or trading, and you can get better gear that way if you don't end up finding it yourself.
---
My personal farming route includes the following locations:
---
- Charleston Capitol
---
- The Whitespring
---
- West-Tek
---
- Huntersville
---
- National Isolated Radio Array
---
- Harper's Ferry &amp; The Burrows
---
- RobCo Research Center
---
- The General's Steakhouse
---
- Dyer Chemical
---
- Crevasse Dam
---
You could probably skip some of the more minor locations, but definitely go to the Capitol, Whitespring, West-Tek, and the Burrows, as they're some of the most densely populated locations in the game.
---
You assuming I support the browns? Lest we not forget about those that assume...
---
Yep. Happened to us. Just have someone, anyone die and that seems to force the game to conclude.
---
If you are on a team, you will get first place. Including the guy that killed himself for science. Congratz!
---
Save your atoms up for a power armor paint that suits your character or that's too good to let pass
---
173 and launched one nuke only and did it solo
---
Yeah for me alot of the 'knowledge' ported over from F4, but even then that game had the same issues where you're just left to figure things out and maybe get a snippet on a load screen as a hint. Poor design coupled with poor execution.  
---
Flashlight is a great example lol, i remember accidentally changing my HUD display in F4 and it took ages to figure out how to flip it back.  
---
For F76 i think the toughest for me was how frames and power armour pieces worked with the stash. The frame weighs 10lbs and generally so do each of the pieces and then the Fusion Core is 3. If you put all of it on a frame, including the core \[by just putting it in the frame inventory like dropping something in your stash\] then the whole thing only weighs 10.  
---
Its like they thought of all these cool ideas, put in a base minimalist effort to implement it, and then just leave it. Like crafting food - there's so much more you could do to make that useful, they went to all the effort to put a ton of recipes in and there's no way to tag what you want for ingredients or easily find any of it - its just there as a feature with zero support. I bet no-one even makes half of it.
---
Haha! I kinda wanna end myself so this can end faster but also I don’t wanna be the first dude down 🤣
---
Normal. Bethesda hasn’t acted on these hackers in months.
---
Do you have analog drift in your controller?
---
he should have specified to nuke fissure site prime.
---
This is a really bad attempt at parody - nobody ever askled for a flawless game
---
Head to the area on the South end of the Mount Blair Train Yard in the south west of the map. There is a small building with closed double doors and keypads on opposite sides of the building itself. When you get near, the event should start. If not, then server hop. You will be spawned in a spot that triggers it. If it doesn't, lather rinse repeat. For me, it seems to come in streaks...I'll get it to spawn 4 or 5 times in a row, then nothing for a while. To make it faster, when server jumping, go through your friends list and join each world. Saves a couple minutes of load time to and from the main screen.
---
Be warned, sometimes Scorchbeasts (1-3) can spawn at that spot. Also, if you see Albino Radstags running around, a Legendary Sheepsquach is near. Other things that can happen are supply drops, insult bot, and prize bot.
---
Doesn't the frame still operate on no core? I can't say i've ever tried it, but in F4 it'd go into slow mode
---
Yes it actually is. 
---
the ,,safer method" is to play on ps4 or xbox
---
Now I wouldn't call it normal but sadly it is indeed like that. I avoid NW and only play adventure.
---
Even the small/free backpack? Thanks I’ll look into that. My wife and I often play together, we’re similar level and all that, she’s able to craft a level 40 that’s what started this search for me
---
Also locked boxes in the Ash Heap if I'm not mistaken.
---
Mate, I went over the same points again and again and you totally failed to comprehend them, so why the fuck should I waste my time with you? Answer.. I shouldn't, arguing with idiots on the Internet is a pointless task. 
---
It helped that another poster outed you as a troll, i assumed you were just thick, now I'm wondering if you're both.
---
From what is posted here this would appear to be so.  I was told they are the master race of cheaters though so its okay apparantly 🤷‍♂️
---
didn't play NW during event. Don't care. Have fun being 1 of a million glowing skeletons, NCR rangers, nurses, or witches.
---
Is there something too close to the bed? I’ve run into this a few times after redoing my camp
---
I wish I would’ve known that intelligence boosts XP again, but thank you and everyone else, who’s finally telling me this!
---
yeah he thought i already knew which one to launch at, i should have sent him a screenshot
---
Not that I know of.
---
I that too and actually moved it into the middle of the floor and it still did it.
---
When I used to still play this game after it first came out. I launched a nuke like 10-15 times.
---
I didn't even think of that,  I just assumed they capped it at 1 and never even tried building multiples. You just did a lot to relieve my buyer's remorse from the fridge. I'm going to build few more as soon as I get off work. Lol.
---
I frequently just nuke random shit, just to see what happens, but yeah, the most common nukes spots are Fissure Site Prime, and Whitesptings.
---
No I believe you get the small/free backpack for free but it’s meant for lower levels if you want to get a higher level one you might have to do the tadpole challenges to get the bigger one and higher level
---
Level 106, been here since Beta, and no nuke
---
Serious? Like...you have to be joking...
---
I have a hard time being willing to spend a minimum of 500 atoms on anything remotely worth a crap.  Just can't make myself do it.
---
I THOUGHT IT WAS MY CONTROLLER THE WHOLE TIME. fuck.
---
Soon soon, when future tech goes away and comes back again. The generator first time and stairs this time
---
It's highly unlikely that you have extras laying around unless they're duped, considering it has a 0.058% drop chance (1 in 1,724)
---
You may have it confused with the pulse grenade plan, which is found in explosives crates.
---
Make sure you have a good troubleshooter wep when running through to launch the nuke. All robot spawn.
---
They get a open door perk
---
Want friends? Follow me behind this abandoned shack, I'll even remove lone wanderer :)))
---
Level 80-something and I never bothered. I started going through with it but when I got to the part where you have to shoot the drone down I gave up. Seemed way too hard, but I was also solo and it probably helps to have a group. I don't have anyone on PC to play with anyway and the friends I had on xbox don't play anymore.
---
It's also probably a bug.
---
The white string lights did the same thing for a while in the patch that implemented the Biv quest line.  That they didn't fix it on the red/white ones is probably an oversight.  I don't think those were actually Nuka-Cola lights, I believe they were originally from last Christmas.
---
Nobody played before beta and could log 8766 hours either.
---
Yep, it's a sad state that NW is in.  Every other match has some idiot literally flying around, shooting up into the sky and killing everyone within a mile of them.  I'm glad I hit rank 100 recently so I don't have to worry about missing out on any cosmetic rewards.
---
I'd play the mode more because it's genuinely fun when everyone's playing legitimately, but the cheaters are currently trashing it on PC, and Bethesda seems to be completely disinterested in fixing it.
---
Why did I not think of this
---
I saw a bunch of people around Whitespring, so I nuked it and logged off for the night.
---
One of my buddies was playing NW and had a companion command option appear lol
---
doesnt make it funnier
---
Elaborate how it's better for people to not be able to get an AAE Handmade without offering a full 3 star unyielding armor set?
---
Can you tell your wife to sleep somewhere else so we can play video games loudly with each other?
---
Since the 1950's
---
I have a few different characters but I only launch nukes on one of them, just because how annoying it is to run through the silos
---
But it's empty!
---
Wait... you might be right.
---
Also did Line in the sand outside fort defiance and no legendary scorched turned up at all. Not sure if they are supposed to on this event?
---
I was just kidding I should add a /s
---
I find them very handy!
---
is really hard to craft a nuke?
---
Thanks, I hadn't done it in so long that I didn't remember if it was open or like the Capital building which was a separate load screen and thus not effected by the nuke. Do liberators drop the nuke materials like other robots? I honestly don't know if I've ever fought them in a nuke zone.
---
The store owner has horrible taste in hair styles, though.
---
lol, well, I guess that's one way to snag an easy win :P
---
Higher your INT the better chance of learning mods when you scrap gun and armor
---
The worst thing is you can't even properly report this. When I opened a ticket they just replied with do a "Scan and Repair". Feels like nobody has ever reported this issue (which I doubt).
---
It works a treat! I only use Good with Salt 1* so it's handy. I don't have the fridge backpack either. I fill my fridges with mostly gourds, cranberry relish and brain fungus soup. I also put the male/female toilet signs on the doors. HeHe.
---
I'm on PC but you could DM me with a TV shot of the build if possible :)
---
How is me having to spread my available playtime out over the amount of days they said the event was going to last, but they cut it off a day early, my fault?
---
Because both games have similair histories and origins but one actually picked up the slack immediately after launch imo.
---
Valseek replied to my last post about this that they “have eyes on the issue”. That comfort only lasts so long. It’s been months. If they have eyes on the issue, it’s time to put hand on it and get it fixed.
---
definitely not i was one hitting last night then nope
---
There's a very useful build planner you can use here: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Not sure if you're using sneak or VATS, but I'd recommend 15 Perception as a baseline for any rifle-focused build.  That'll allow you to max out all 3 Commando perks, Tank Killer, and either Concentrated Fire or Ground Pounder depending on if you use VATS or not.  If you are using VATS, also increase your Agility and Luck high enough to use VATS-focused perks in those stats.
---
ESO plus is not the pay to play subscription service the game launched with.  
---
But don't worry, if you are wrong you can always move the goalposts.
---
I didn't know about that, looking into it now, would make sense lol
---
Elaborate *this*
---
If they outnumber me, I like to pull out my vampire's ultracite gatling laser. I kill them more slowly, but I don't die. Otherwise, my gatling plasma makes short work of them.
---
I’m genuinely curious, I keep seeing this statement made here on reddit, Twitter, YouTube.
---
Yep going to be with the Communist items seen in the last Atom datamine - https://imgur.com/a/J50Nqdd
---
While the execution wasn't your finest hour, your heart  was in the right place.  Its noble work trying to get a laugh out of this audience.  Have an upvote my dude.
---
Have you held the rest button till the circle fills?  I know it’s an obvious thing but sometimes I forget to do that.
---
Well, I'm from Buenos Aires, and I say kill them all!
---
Yeah, I agree.  We all know why Bethesda does this time limited stuff - to create FOMO (fear of missing out) and drive sales.  But ever since they started doing this on a regular basis, they've gotten pretty carried away with it, to the point where the Atomic Shop *is* pretty sparse on any given week now.
---
I agree - there are some things you'd think would be perennial sellers.  Camouflage paints, for example.  Laminate wood floors.  Plants.  You know, the basic, versatile stuff.  But they get lumped into the FOMO basket like everything else.
---
Mole Rats tunneling up through concrete steps and solid rock.
---
Im not using vats at all..... I just aim and fire. no sneak either.
---
Nah,Xbox...
---
I couldn’t even begin too aquire that bugger In my current state anyhow.
---
Gave my main too my Old Lady,&amp; my son’s tryin too strongarm his way onto my only alternate.
---
So it’ll be one of those mythical things until I re-toon a new alt.
---
Such Is the life of a RPG gaming family man.
---
It ain’t as bad as I made it sound honestly
---
Lol
---
Second game I queued had my team and another team of 3 🤣 wtf Bethesda?!
---
Wastelanders will make or break this game. That assuming that they plan on keep supporting the game anyway.
---
Make sure to set it to collect scrap, not junk. It holds way more and you'll get rarer stuff too
---
I can’t pay my internet bill and I can’t download the hotfix! BETHESDA HAS GONE TOO FAR WITH P2W.
---
All of these items were fallout 4 items from the nuka world DLC and the contraptions DLC
---
The [thirst zapper](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Thirst_Zapper)  was a water gun that shot water. It was red and shaped like a nuka cherry with the Nuka cola logo on its side. 
---
The [acid soaker](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Acid_Soaker) was a similar item that shot acid. It was shaped like a modified 9mm pistol with a small glass cartridge coming off its side that contained the acid.
---
The [paintball gun](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Paintball_gun?mobile-app=false) they nerfed close to a month ago to weight about 2k lbs, despite this players kept it (myself included) because you could paint dicks and other things on players bases and other surfaces.
---
Try putting it in camera mode with your focus on well anything. You'll know pretty quickly of there is drift. 
---
Also move them around a bit just incase it's something stuck in there which only occasionally gets caught.
---
It needs fixing is the bottom line. Thanks for the input.
---
I need to put more into INT. Mainly I have been putting them in strength, agility, endurance, and perception not much in INT
---
When I say full access I mean a full cli account able to do the same modifications I could do on a local machine as far as creating mod files. They have devs, they should know the degree of access their own devs need to create materials. Modders should have that degree of access to dev machines. I'm not advocating they get root access or anything crazy like that.
---
I like the map , more impressed you didnt try to force you tube down our throats . I'll likely watch and like the video later tonight .
---
He never claimed he was unbanned. That was someone else.
---
The event is over
---
People are back to not playing NW
---
Yeah, not really interested in buying the game again, giving up on progress, etc, because Bethesda can't be bothered to add basic functions to their game.
---
I...was...so...excited
---
I have to start paying attention to the tags before I read a post
---
Neither are a good value unless you like the looks of them. The fridge barely holds anything and you have to buy it all over when there's a new skin. The Collectron is fun but doesn't collect enough junk to actually be useful. At this point, I'd save your atoms for something that really grabs you, or like someone else said, get that sweet plague doctor mask. ;)
---
Yep, never launched one yet, still hopeful though
---
I've actually had a suspicion since every time I bring up the map my cursor drifts up into the corners. Going to have to look at my settings, I'm on PC.
---
That was it’s sale price, like, 6 days ago
---
One day only
---
Ain't nuthin' plain about them gatlin plasmas, son!
---
I would've bought solid PA paints if they were available when the game first launched. But now it's like meh.
---
Definitely agree they should have a wider selection of those basic colors.
---
I have tons of fragments but never used em
---
I thought it was bird bones screwing with my jet pack. I knew it felt really goofy to try to use it. Thanks.
---
That's not how this works. Play stupid games... you know the rest. The fact of the matter is the dude *could* have contacted someone over at Bethesda since he was running a decently known resource website within the community. Instead he used a cheat engine.
---
All of the items they say are vaulting this week vaulted last week.
---
Early after the game came out I launched one by myself! I think I was around lvl 50, it was hard but it felt like an accomplishment.
---
Oh I used to be a pure melee but I switched up to guns just to keep my playstyle fresh, that and it gives more to do for mats haha.
---
Also ye there ya go
---
I launched a nuke at the first day of release
---
Only like level 20 but nope, I think I had something related to the nuke drop but I had no idea what to do with it. Dunno if I still have it even since I'm always dealing with inventory. To think of it, I've never seen someone drop a nuke either. I figure because that's an end game thing???
---
"Please Bethesda, remove all the game elements of this game"... smh
---
It took a little while but F76's first update season was pretty good. Better than getting Craglorn and then having to wait for year to get Imperial City
---
I think I'm around lvl 50? But the 3 or 4 times that I tried launching one, the server crashed so I quit trying and eventually stopped playing all together
---
Can you sell from the fridge? Might be useful for selling xpbuff food
---
In that case you have a lot of flexibility in what you can do with your build.  I'd recommend trying to work your way toward these perks and add in whatever else you like: https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1f11112&amp;d=pg2ph2pi2pp2po2l71a00&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
Are you familiar with how mutations work?  You're high enough level now to be able to take the Starched Genes perk, which will allow you to keep your mutations and not remove them with Radaway or decontamination showers.  They're a pretty important part of any build so I'd recommend taking that perk ASAP and choose some mutations that suit you.
---
It'll be a big deal for sure but I'm gonna play this game until the bitter end
---
Hopefully you figure it out. I can't help with PC stuff I'm a console gamer.
---
Creating so many solo instances of the world will be a huge hit on server resources, im afraid Wastelanders might be behind the Fallout 1st subscription due to the cost of creating so many individual instances.
---
You should be able to craft a lvl 40 small backpack. I would submit a ticket if not working
---
was just down at fissure prime and took out 5 of them, didn't notice anything special..
---
Still no fix for the heavy gun spin up bug...
---
If I understood you correctly, everyone gets an alert when you launch a nuke, displaying your name. I guess it's just a matter of checking who is on what Silo on the map, if they want to chase you off.
---
Or for like a dollar.
---
I remember them saying something about being able to place static objects one day, but maybe my mind is playing tricks on me.
---
Morgan town is THE place to farm hi rad fluids. Just make sure you hit the trainyard on the west side as well as the college area on the east. With some aiming you can hit the airport as well and start collision course. And in the middle of the town are still the "back on the beat event and "feed the people"  I have low luck points but I can easily get up to 30 fluids with traversing the whole town one time. And they do respawn rather fast within the time the nuke zone lasts. It's also riddled with cobalt flux and a good few yellowcakes. Also present is razorgrain that turns into gigagrain which gives you violet flux. Just north of the airport or the small farm south of town. But you will have to make choice as you cant hit them both. And a few in the before mentioned student area. Next to one of the houses are some ferns. And one grain plant in the little tree area south of the trainstation. But indeed violet flux is scarce there.
---
As long as you stay pacifist, it doesn’t matter tho right?
---
Level 190 and I've launched only one solo.  I think was level 75 or so when I did it.
---
The fuck they do.
---
Fallout 1st, empty stash on armor mule, no love with a ticket.  :(
---
I said this in another post. Gets atoms and nothing that I want to spend them on.
---
My first one was at the Whitepsring. I'm sure the Overseer was not impressed.
---
What is the target for your next one? If it's Fissure Site Prime, which point will you leave open?
---
(1st time is boring, someone pre-cleared and obviously forgot their nuke card. I coded in and nuked)
---
Second; My fiance and her cousin were over watching my background play
---
Told them nukes exist. Well. Go nuke those six camps around WS
---
Sure, okay
---
Run through the silo for the first time, some guy joins mid way
---
Turns out his house was in the nuke launch zone 😂
---
Blew him away :/ (I did go over and help him rebuild, oops)
---
Thanks for the reply anyways, didn't know about analog drift to begin with o/
---
I just want a BoS paint job for my lore correct T-51b PA. Is that too much to ask?
---
I haven't launched one yet. I would like to at one point but I need a team on Xbox who can help me with it
---
Lvl 90 never done it
---
No I think it has something to do with armor working "properly" now.
---
A simple solution in my opinion would be just making the purveyor sell in different types. For example (heavy/Rifle/one handed melee/two handed melee/unarmed/explosive)
---
It'd be dope but i assume the only reason they havent is because it wouod complicate rendering and player mobility in some cases where people would have their camps crowded with placed junk lol
---
It is known.
---
you obviously dont know the whole story. the people who got banned DO work with people at bethesda. we have both lady devann and jurassica as contacts on discord and in our discord server.
---
Lmao.
---
Honestly I would hold off until Christmas time. I’m sure there will be something good worth buying then.
---
Please do it
---
More than shit that shouldn't exist, that was already retconned? I mean there's the scout armor, the scout underarmor, the X-01, the officer outfit, and an entire quest line.
---
I'm sure it will be released as a bundle in the shop, sometime after Wastelanders. They know we want it, and they will make us wait and pay.
---
I enjoy what we have now. Scout armor is cool.
---
Very true, it's unfortunate camps would look so much more lived in if so
---
you obviously dont know the whole story. the people who got banned work with people at bethesda. we have both lady devann and jurassica as contacts on discord and in our discord server. we work with the community managers to find and report bugs and the exact methods in code that it uses in order to give the developers an easier time when fixing them
---
I see here people calling map76 guy a cheater. Is there an aspect of the story that was not reported or otherwise inaccurate? Was he using the exploit to gain advantage?
---
I’ve been playing since beta and I’m only level 90-something now, but I spend too much time decorating my house and never legendary farming. I don’t have the gear, my 300 caps won’t purchase anything worthwhile, and I have about 5 stimpaks to my name. No where close to dropping a nuke for a very long time!  lol
---
AND BROTHERHOOD OF STEEL STUFF
---
It has seriously been too long waiting.
---
I love how expecting something you've purchased to work as designed and/or expected is "entitled".
---
No. Pistols being agility is awesome. This in no one makes them more viable.
---
Rambo you're arguing with a bunch of shills, they don't argue in good faith. Your downvotes were underserved.
---
I suggested something like this a little while back. Have meat weak again but with a twist. Getting a full meatcook unlocks the bonus round where you have to kill the ravenous legendary radgobbler before the timer runs out or heel retreat back into the forest. Completing the bonus round unlocks a new tier of rewards. All during Thanksgiving week with a massive purveyor sale on black Friday.
---
Yes same wasn’t till i was level 150 I thought i had to decrypt the code so i never attempted I’m glad nukacrypt exists and several youtubers.
---
If they had been releasing the right items into the shop, they would have procured a lot more funding.  Instead, we got fruit hats....
---
Did you change the properties to read only after?
---
Idk by the vault boy 2000 plushie is on sale even though it doesnt say so. So I'd say anything is possible right now, grab it before they put servers under maintenance again

Don't ask for it too much, or they might include it as an exclusive for another subscription.
---
you are very unaware of the situation and seem to have gotten whatever information you have from a third party who also doesnt know the situation. there were 4 of us who ended up banned. we work with the community managers to find and report bugs and exploits and the exact methods that are used to reproduce them with a comprehensive explanation so the developers dont have to spend hours/days/weeks trying to figure it out themselves and can get to fixing it. the things weve reported have a faster turnaround time than other things due to the amount of info we give
---
Did they fuckin crash their game while attempting to fix it? 
---
This is incredible.
---
Not that I’m aware but the fact is that he used it to do something with the game files right? He’s not a Bethesda employee as far as I’m aware, they have every right to ban him. This is why they have a tos.
---
You’re claiming they don’t care about their loyal fans because they’re banning them. Most of these “data miners” don’t even play the game, they just dig up dirt on Bethesda and use it to get clicks.
---
I agree, although there is quite a bit of BoS stuff in game.  Meanwhile, Enclave gets zero love.
---
I've launched a couple and I'm level 206, I definitely just join in other people's nukes more often.
---
I've never because I'm to weak I'm like a level 60. I always died in the last area
---
Send Todd Howard your next paycheck and the rest of your dignity and they will.
---
I got full lobbies consistently before the event at this time. The only slow hours are 2-7am EST.
---
Why was I downvoted for quoting their words, not mine.
---
\&gt;  don’t have strong enough gear/not a good enough build for end game stuff.
---
That implies you may not have the major 4 PAs : Excavator, T51, Ultracite, and X01 
---
Do you have blade of bastet, black diamond, or perfect storm?
---
Those two questions represent 6 different questlines and one seek and find.  (Add 2 more seek and finds if you don't have quantum and nuka cola paint.)
---
In the course of acquiring those, you'll pick up lots of levels, lots of XP, and lots of new (and likely, better) gear.
---
You might be surprised what you can accomplish with the "plain" stuff or low level legendary weapon(s).    Here's why I say that:
---
I didn't know squat about builds and the perk system when I started playing.  Wanted to be a gunner, but melee weapons were working better, so I continued to use them, and eventually learned a decent perk configuration.  In the process,  I did my first solo non-nuked Whiteprings run at L27 w/ a 1\* L20 vampire machete and leather body armor.   At L45, changed to a non-legendary L45 cultist dagger/L45 Excavator, then at L65, a 1\* vampire switchblade/Excavator.
---
Took down my first SB @L50 with a combat rifle and an incomplete set of T45. Did couple of SBQs fights in Excavator and a gatling gun.    Last SB I killed landed in front of me; it never took off again - T51 and that same 1\* vampire switchblade.
---
Don't worry about not having the best of everything.
---
Anti Armor also works well for me. I was surprised by that, but I have a AAE handmade and it really does the trick on all types of robots.
---
You get reduced damage taken/given, but when they are attacking you with high-DPS guns in groups, it can start hurting. They are going to waste a ton of ammo though.
---
Exactly my point thanks for that
---
Yes. I got it to work by changing the actual inis. Customs dont work anymore it seems
---
Just be prepared for it to be behind a paywall, my gues is 20$
---
How does it not make them more viable to move it to perception? You take up 9 of your agi slots with pistol buffs leaving only 6 for sneak perks. Meanwhile, rifle build can have both rifle and sneak perks
---
I guess there's no way to tell unless some one recorded the pop-up.
---
I may send him a stack of magazines to weigh.
---
I'd be indifferent if it's adventure only. It would mess up NW
---
Legitimately a great idea.
---
Just ground the scorchbeasts and have them gobble after us lol
---
When it's ajar.
---
And i love you too. Bro-mance mode activate!!. Thanks for the award!
---
I was in a game with 10 people and now just loaded into one with 4. Only my team is in the game....?
---
I had everything after about 30-40 games. It took about 8 total hours.
---
Woo I'm buying it tonight! What hardware do y'all think goes good with it?
---
I'm level 99 and have never launched. I don't have any friends that play so I've never had a team to go in a do an end game before.
---
How have you never launched a nuke lol it's the last mission of the current story
---
This is a heavily reported issue.
---
We had a team of 4 one time, with literally no one to play against. We won the game by having a team mate suicide himself.
---
Another game, we had a team of 4 against 2 solo players. We won when the solo players were fighting each other, and we just picked off the winner.
---
Here is another thread of people with the same issue:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dvf1f3/nw\_glitch\_extravaganza/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dvf1f3/nw_glitch_extravaganza/)
---
Try equipping fireproof rank 3.
---
Yeah with another player. I was high 80s and they were over 100.
---
You're right, I should of quit my job.
---
there has only been 1 handmade paint in the shop - the scapper paint .  Two others has been datamined but not released.
---
I agree but the problem is Bethesda isn't in tune with their audience. For example Fallout 1st.
---
I haven't played since March, but never launched a nuke, lvl ~130. I would still collect all the codes from the roaming mob, but never wanted to waste the mats and ammo.
---
I find the best way to get XP is to take over Workshops, then do the Defend Workshop quest. Get seven or eight, doing all the Defend quests, then server hop
---
Dont buy it and they will learn. Or, other people are paying those prices.
---
lol me 2!
---
I just got a game with 7. We won within a minute lol.

---
not gonna lie, u had me going in the first half...
---
They r mutated and have super powers
---
I sell literally all plans @10 caps, and have never sold a fashion over 5k, those being the super rare ones. Ammo @1 cap a round. I'm literally always swimming in caps.
---
Level 88 never launched a nuke it would always crash at the end.
---
I am not familiar with how they work if you could explain it to me I would greatly appreciate it. The one mutation that I do want is the one where you can jump high
---
But aren't you going for a rifle build? A majority of your points should be in perception, agility, and luck. Theres a lot of great commando guides out there if you search for it. Might take a look at Captain Noobs.
---
Thank you bro. but I am on Ps4. 😅
---
It wasn't a day it was a few hours and plenty of other people handled it just fine. If you do not have time to play a game, don't blame the game, do something else.
---
Indeed, they would
---
Lv37 never launched a nuke, deleted the game a week ago.
---
yeah the mismanagenement of the atom shop  is one of the great mysteries of F76.  Think about it - at the height of the TSE handmade crazy there were no handmade skins at all.
---
It is because the Elite Ranger outfit, Advanced Riot Armor, and Desert Ranger outfit are all released on a monthly basis. It is part of their incentive program to subscribe for each month. This month it was the Riot Armor (green variant of the Ranger outfit with a brown/tan helmet).
---
Good with salt perk helps it from spoiling as quickly. You can cook it right before it spoils and it resets the bar.
---
You think their [“Biggest free update yet”](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more)  will cost $20?
---
&gt;You assuming I support the browns? Lest we not forget about those that assume
---
No, I'm stating that based upon your post history
---
Maybe people havent realized the servers are finally up yet? chill
---
you wouldnt say any of those things if youve tested them. luck of the draw with the beam splitter will proc so often that you barely need to repair your weapon. tested. verified.
---
explosive resistance specifically on SB was buffed and I suggest you actually do ingame testing before assuming anything about how the number crunching will work.
---
Definitely get a point or two in sneak. I dont run vats and didnt run sneak for a while. Out 2 points in it and dropped action boy. Huge improvement in damage output and sneak at 2 stars is very effective
---
Probably because the reward was worth it to them.
---
LOVE the plague doctor mask
---
Join the cannibals and eat on the fly!
---
Yep. When your game can be hacked with a COMMON PC HEX EDITING SOFTWARE.... You did something bad, mmmmkay?
---
This is why I, nor 6 of my RL friends play on PC anymore. 
---
After reporting dozens of cheaters, we just bought the game on Xbone. Haven't seen any obvious hackers as of yet.
---
Level 153 here and I have launched at least 30 nukes
---
How many times can they bring back limited items
---
Not everyone us s Reddit. They are basing their own price. Don’t buy it if you think it’s too expensive. Or message and ask to negotiate. I’ve always had good responses
---
Cook and eat it as you go.  Don't hold onto it for so long.
---
In between, consider taking the Good Doggy perk and having some Canned Dog Food on hand.
---
And since then, we've gotten one.
---
Did they fix sbs so they are targetable with vats after you hit them also?  Some are vats-able(sp?) but some have been very stubborn with vats. At work so just curious.
---
Yes in advance, i know you can kill them without need of vats if they are not targetable. Have done many times now. 
---
Thanks in advance!

Along with all the other xp boosts get in a group with someone who can share the charisma xp card or grab it yourself

I recently purchased fallout 1st just to do this. I haven’t yet
---
Agreed. I can't wait for it. Hubbub has been positive, but it is Bethesda after all, so I expect it to launch with a ton of game breaking bugs.
---
I've only ever launched 1 nuke before, Don't see myself launching a nuke anytime soon since I don't need anymore Flux &amp; My friends do plenty of Queen Runs
---
Yeah, my response was a little SJW. my bad... I'll go give myself some lashings.
---
Seems like a great way to get xp haha
---
People ALWAYS nuke the cranberry bog

Wood Armor is low-key awesome for stealth, and if you want to live a bit dangerously.
---
Red Bull gives you wings. It gives radroaches opposable thumbs.
---
Hey man they've gone back on their word once and they arent afraid to do it again. Think about it, if the atomic shop and F1st dont make them enough money then what's the other option? They already delayed it because they have an unfinished product. So what happens if they fall short now? They either pack up and call it quits or cover the costs and put a paywall up to insure their losses. I'm too lazy to do it but I'll go find mike whoever's statement on the atomic shop being cosmetics only if you dont believe they've gone back on their word.
---
So because of some niche cases you think it's okay to name and shame everyone else? Your logic is dumb.
---
Lol people downvote me because they're scared to accept reality.
---
I don't know how to do half the shit in this game lol
---
I thought they released a silver version one time.
---
Another to add to the list that Bethesda will never fix
---
Thank you! I did that as well,  it came here for practice, in game help as well, haha
---
LMAO That’s hilarious. Thanks for the insight on the acid soaker and thirst zapper
---
Pretty sure it was 180 atoms off the original price, not 180 to purchase.
---
There is a refrigeration mod for the pioneer backpack.
---
Takes a bit of grinding, but it basically gives you good with salt 2.
---
I noticed on PS4 even the trading communities on there their prices are far higher than the ones I've seen on reddit, not sure why that's the case.
---
There is also shelf stable food that does not go bad. Can dog food, sugar bombs,etc.
---
Pretty easy to find around world, check buildings and food stands when you see them.
---
Not usually possible. The game boots you from any servers with &lt;24 players.
---
it can be worth doing once just to experience the process, the silo. and it is fun to see one touch down knowing you launched it
---
a silver/black were datamined along with the gold we got.  But it were never released
---
Anything, really.  That's what's nice about it.
---
It's also similar to a gas mask (not sure if it functions like one) - it won't hide things like ponytails and you can wear it with a hat or prisoner collar.
---
im pretty sure no one expected the wastelanders delay
---
feeling really bad for bgs austin rn

Magic
---
Buy it. It'll just cost your soul, arms, and your first born child
---
I really regret getting those weapons at such a low level. I can’t scale them up. I’m rarely in Power Armor, but maybe I’ll bring that Ultracite and knock off some quests
---
You let people use an exploit hundreds of times before banning them alright.
---
Well these people who may or may not have been banned cant exactly defend themselves or tell their side of all this can they?
---
enemy count seems to vary, I blame server problems. i've had runs full of non-stop bots and heavy laser turrets everywhere. i've had runs with most of the turrets gone or too laggy to do anything and minimal enemy spawns, making the last phase especially a joke
---
&gt; Update (Nov 12, 2019): During today’s maintenance, an issue was discovered that we will need to address before we can roll out all of the fixes planned for today’s update. Two fixes have been implemented today, and the rest will arrive with the full hotfix once we’ve resolved the issue discovered during downtime. We will let you know once we’re ready to move forward with this hotfix in the next few days.
---
Holy shit, this is one of the funniest things I've ever read. 
---
They need to hotfix their hotfix. 
---
It's moved beyond amateurish ineptitude and now entering the level of masterpiece comedy.
---
I got a great tip for new players, uninstall the game immediately and get a refund.
---
Fair enough, but why do you need to do it on the server and not your local machine, then push it (like git committing to a remote repo, if you're familiar with that) to the server when you're ready to test it. I don't see why you need to create the files on their machine.
---
That said, I could potentially see what you're talking about being reasonable, I just don't really see a reason for it. Maybe we just make completely different types of stuff, but still, it can't be *that* different. 
---
My concern is that the servers are gonna be run on some form of Linux, likely containerized if they're smart, and I'm fairly sure that most modders are used to windows and haven't even used Linux (I'm sure some have, you may have, I don't mean to be patronizing but its just the most likely scenario), so getting access to a bash shell with tools that would need to be newly developed for Linux, or possibly run on Wine, would be a huge learning curve vs the somewhat minor inconvenience that developing it locally and then pushing it when you're ready to test it out would be.  
---
I really wouldn't be surprised at all if that's how they do it. I agree that they know what is needed, and should provide that. It being multiplayer with a server and client and all, the development is going to be different than just Fallout 4 is. 
---
I'm sure if we ever get mods, they'll provide a dev kit with all the necessities.
---
Sorry for assuming you were advocating for crazy stuff lol. You seem reasonable, and I believe we agree where it matters.
---
Me with the fruit hat for a long time. Guess I'm down to just waiting for the Poodle Skirt now...
---
Pretty definitive post. 
---
Also, smart move should keep down the post that will flood in soon about how they were banned unfairly.
---
Entitled, yeah, one who has basically worked for free for the company that refuses him 14 dollars back. You guys that have the nerves to defend these companies are the primary reason why they are this way.
---
How do you know if it's an exploit without validating it?
---
It could have been a fluke the first time around.
---
Also, making the game hackable using common PC hex editing software is ridiculous.
---
I believe once they learn someone is using an exploit they can determine how many time the exploit, say a cheat engine, was used.
---
And this...this is what it has come too
---
When did servers come up?
---
HeHe! Get them plugged in and stocked up!
---
On XB, lobbies are always busy on weeknights
---
Lvl 110ish, never launched. I've done many SBQ fights, but I've yet to launch it myself. I keep thinking I should for completion's sake, but... meh.
---
I rarely see them there to be honest!
---
Been playing since the beta. Never launched a nuke
---
Nobody trades caps for top items anymore.
---
The Good: Trading is very fun and interesting
---
The Bad: Game is full of bugs and issues
---
The Ugly: Bethesda ignores any issue and bugs in favor of money at the cost of the game.
---
I haven't seen a moth man in about
---
I'm still waiting for the fast travel bug fix. Several months ago there was a patch and ever since any time I want to fast travel I have to select it multiple times before I actually travel.
---
I don't think you could EVER convince me that a simple reskin of a digital item is worth $18. That is an assload of money to spend on something so pointless, you could get entire DLC's for that cost, it's madness.
---
so what about the Map76 guy? he said he reported an exploit through proper channels and they banned him?  was he lying? or...?
---
Funny, they seem to be doing it left and right on here...
---
Yes! That is second on my top priority fixes list. Really hate that one.
---
Ummm I dont think you realize how many caps I make selling things like XO1 military paint for 5000 caps or bulk acid for 101 a pop. There are poor people, there are those who dont care about caps, and there are the uneducated. Ya pick a target or few and stick with it.
---
Sure is, they can't play normally so they hack it up.
---
Been playing since launch and I've never launched one either! I'm too scared of the game crashing.
---
They broke something. 
---
Like 6 threads about it on the front page so far.
---
What's worse, is it doesn't kick you out of a game if less than XX players are in. This used to happen.
---
You guys have just as much as we do with the exception of X-01 rank paint.
---
It's pretty fun if you can bear going through the silo.
---
I went through solo and then launched it right outside Whitespring where there's always 5+ camps.
---
"In the forrest *their*". There\*
---
Yeah and for 3 perk points id rather invest into something else and just repair to 200%  I'm not saying it doesnt work. Im saying its not worth unless you're a food build. As repair costs are dirt cheap anyway. So yes. I would say that. As i have tested it. 
---
Explosive resistance on SB is buffed. Sure. But energy weapons hit on the energy resistance. Not Explosive. 
---
Couple that with the fact that SBs have always had high Energy Resist, and youre still going to do less damage with a focuser. Sure, your individual shot damage might go up on paper DPS, but your actual DPS will go down as youre still not doing enough in one shot to overcome the ER. Meanwhile the raw damage of the splitter is enough to overcome and outdamage the focuser. 
---
To:Dr?
---
Meanwhile,
---
You do know you can move your CAMP your self when that happens right?
---
It’ll come! Just in the form of cash shop bundles.
---
Hey, I like my fruit hat!
---
I had it combined with my Vampire costume for Halloween. I was a fruit bat.
---
Oh- Cool! Thanks, happy to know about it :D
---
This statement might've actually had some weight if it had been made on one of the several posts claiming to have been banned for finding and reporting exploits
---
I've honestly never seen any talk of this. I just wanted to point out that if someone was banned they wouldn't be able to tell their side of the story. I get the post is about people not being banned but this could just be some phoney coverup
---
At a certain point you kinda just have to blame yourself for keeping playing...
---
Three games in a row where it's been one team vs one team. One game where we were the only team and it just went till one of us died.
---
Good times.
---
Cook constantly. Also I find soups not only last the longest, but are best for both food and water.
---
Ban the hackers in NW FFS. you know who they are.  No one will want to play it if it's not dealt with in a timely manner.
---
 Of course all that crap is necessary. My Combat Knives go out around 150 and escalate quickly into the 300s on occasion. All three have +40% Speed and various other goodness added. They hit about 3 times a sec, maybe 4. I can summon the Golf Club and waste the entire thing as a horde.
---
 That does not stop you from shooting stuff. My Instigating Lever Action is down a bit as my Commando has taken over Perception for my auto Hunters Handmade Exploder. None of this affects my knives at all.
---
 After a lot of experimenting I tossed Class Freak as it does nothing that helps me. With Twisted Muscles up I headshot stuff all the time. Perhaps its because I refuse to use VATS I dunno.
---

&gt;I had messed with the memory
---
straight from the horses mouth
---
THAT'S the incentive? Re-skins of the ranger armor? Hooooooo boy. That's lame AF. And I even subbed for a month to get the ranger coat so I'm obviously a rube but I ain't that big of a rube
---
Tagging for notice.
---
u/LadyDevann
---
Yeah- apparently it's cut content! It's really cool looking though!
---
It's cause way too much stuff is run either limited time or taken down to generate FOMO. End of the day it's anticonsumer.
---
Probably who they're referring to as having used the exploit a bunch of times.
---
There were 30+ in each game I played this weekend.  Maybe that was entirely due to the glowing skeleton costume reward, before it got pulled?
---
good call, ill just reduce the price of my 3\* bloodied explosive FFR handmades to 100 caps
---
It's more annoying than hard to do so.
---
I'm level 125 and not launched one yet. No real reason to to be honest.
---
plain old = non legendary :)  
---
And I'm a melee build, so only about 34 dmg per hit.  but it sure did hit a whole lot in a very short amount of time :)
---
Woa!!!! Really???
---
Cool story bro.
---
Level 355, how in the fuck... lmao. Im impressed when I see people that high of a level.
---
The largest small backpack carries 30lbs.  To jump to 60lbs you need to become a Possum Scout by doing the Tadpole quest line
---
He used a cheat engine to discover the exploit/bug.  During a "cheat engine" ban wave a couple weeks ago the cheat engine he used was still on his account.  He didn't lie per se, he just failed to remove the cheat engine and may have continued to use after he reported the exploit/bug.
---
Tbh I thought that at first, like it was just a copy and paste into the area, but the area is unique so it's not that :)
---
"If you find an exploit, you should absolutely report it to us but do not continue use of it." 
---
Pretty self explanatory.
---
The guy himself updated the information and the ban may be related to cheat engine.
---
I’m excited also but it’s going to be a long wait so I’ve been playing F04 in the meantime. I’m curious to see what these factions look like plus the kind of stories they bring to Appalachia from beyond. We need a new trailer of what’s coming!
---
I always preferred [fo76map](https://fo76map.com/) anyway.
---
225 never
---
Yeah, that last phase was odd. Had like a total of four gutsies and 2 protectrons, broken up in to two waves with lots of time in between. I've seen videos of people taking on what looked like an army and all we had was a few foot soldiers. I was pleasantly surprised by how little ammo I had to use to get through that place.
---
uh... to wear? it's a costume. like all the other costumes, and you wear them.
---
it's what you do with a costume. 
---
i can't believe this required an explanation.
---
I sell all my plans for around 10% of the recommended retail price - maybe 20% if the plans are rare.
---
Maybe they banned the hackers and now there are only 3 players left in the entire ecosystem? Don't worry they will probably release some limited time Christmas skins and force everyone to unwillingly play NW again.
---
Nights used to be dark. Then there was a succession of "Bethesda plz make nights brighter!"
---
thank you I will search him now!
---
Yea it was.
---
I'm not kidding it put me with only one other person in the lobby.
---
these are awesome! Thank you
---
I launched a nuke and stopped playing thinking it was the end of the game.  One day someone mentioned that's not the end, I have not been back.
---
For reference I do web application development. I'm fully versed in AWS deployment, and most of the sites I've built have used Docker containers under Linux. I also use Ansible for deployment extensively.
---
I actually haven't done Fallout mods. I have fired up the Creation Engine GECK for Fallout 4, but I haven't had time to play with it for any lengthy amount of time, so I don't know what degree of control modders need to create mods. But they need full access to whatever they need if we are eve to get good mods on the system.
---
Why do so many people feel like spreading this non-sense. 
---
From Bethesda's website
---
&gt;We’ve been hard at work on Fallout 76 this year, including our biggest **free update** yet, Wastelanders
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more
---
Thank you, I can’t make the largest small backpack only a level 10. Grinding on my tadpole badges to get the full sized one
---
All for more brotherhood stuff, but there are 3 underarmors, at least 3 scribe outfits, and a lab coat. Definitely want more, but the enclave prolly does need a lil love
---
Oh man I love launching nukes! There was this one time this guy had a realllly racist camp set up and he was super hateful so I dropped a bomb on his house while he was in vault 94😝🤣 I have a video of it but I don't know how to show it.
---
They say it took a whole tree to make George Washington's wooden teeth
---
Depends what youre talking about really. There are items that are expensive for a reason.
---
There is absolutely no doubt in my mind my sneak perk was equipped only visually because I took all agility perks off and put them back on and it's a different game. Just like it used to be. Thank you so much
---
Ban them all
---
If you are on PC you can stop by my museum, I have all the unobtainables, masks and outfits on display at my camp.
---
You reckon it’s likely he’s reading?
---
Just 34?!? Man up and get your ass out there. In the northeast we don't get locked in even it's in the negatives and it feels like our souls are freezing when we step outside. 34 I'd sweater weather!
---
The player probably do, but Bethesda don’t, since these hacker hasn’t report the bug to Bethesda yet. LOL
---
Solo. Fissure prime.
---
this is the kind of the public communication i think ppl are asking for.  while the message content might upset some (with or without reason), we can certainly appreciate the clarity and conciseness of the statement.
---
Clearly you don't remember Skyrim's spiders opening locked doors. :)
---
West Tek is a wonderful place. Not only is it a place where you have a decent chance to find a legendary, but also all this steel and plastic. If you incorporate it into your legendary farming route, you don't even have to go out of your way to accumulate tons of steel!
---
I might also suggest supplementing with Grafton Dam. That place has a crapload of super mutants, and there are at least two workbenches. Drawbacks are that I'm pretty sure the mutants there can't spawn as high level as West Tek (someone correct me on this if need be) and it's a bit confusing to navigate, but if you run both West Tek and the Dam before hopping servers, you'll probably have more steel than you know what to do with after a handful of runs.
---
Yea, I got perfect storm before I knew about rewards scaling to level... mine was L15.  I got ultracite way after getting X01.  If you still have the original, I think blade of bastet can be re-made up to L45 or 50.
---
Maybe I don't know.
---
Hmm... I'll play around more later. But I was bouncing around looking for legendaries and their ranged attacks were doing at least double what they were yesterday. Did some server swaps. Will test out more later tonight.
---
This post is unbelievably disingenuous. Nobody ever said you were banning people just for reporting bugs/exploits.  Good people were banned for using third party programs ***with the sole intent of confirming and reporting exploits to you.*** 
---
Of course, I'm sure you already know that, and this is just a feeble attempt to mislead and manipulate us. What a shame.
---
Naked Bush Wookies.. next, on Ted Koppel.
---
Wait they got Responder stuff this week? Haven't had any in months. Also, since you can't wear in-game cosmetics in NW you can't rep Responders or Enclave, and you've only got the Maxson coat for Brotherhood
---
same problem on the ps4.
---
Awesome! Thank you.
---
Not to mention the 5-6 rank paints and bomber jacket you get from turning in technical data, plus Elder Maxons coat.
---
hmmm....I may have to rethink that one...
---
well i still have yet to nuke prime since last time some dude who was invisible stole the nuke after we cleared out the enemies
---
I’d say it’s a bit of a stretch, but even in the slim chance he was, he’d be crying out for a paragraph to break up that mammoth slab ;)
---
bye bethesda, bye fallout 76
---
My answer too :)
---
Now level 186 and still have not because I’m still bugged on both of my characters. I want too but I can never get passed the replace the main frame cores part, I never get any to repair even though I pick them up and when I pick them up, I cant place them anywhere and end up just leaving the silo in frustration. Both characters have the exact same issue....
---
Nope, never. I tried alone and couldn't get past the bots 😔
---
Level 153 and just last week I went with some friends through the silo and participated in launching a nuke.  The first time I tried months ago, the server crashed while installing the server cores and I hadn’t tried since then.  I also participated in taking out the queen for the first time that run as well so two big achievements in one session
---
Yes. Bloodied unarmed stealth. Getting her to land is the hardest part.
---
They know exactly who they are. You can peer into their discord here:   [https://violet-vibes.github.io/Dupers-are-bad/](https://violet-vibes.github.io/Dupers-are-bad/)
---
I would imagine its because an awful lot of their new content for it was tied in with Wastelanders. And not expecting a delay they've got little and are scrambling to put some assets out 'early'.
---
At least that's what i keep telling myself while i wait for my Gauss rifle skins...
---
Whaat? It's better! 😜
---
All of the items were being added at 8pm ET each day, meaning the rewards updated 4 hours before midnight. Unlike most of Bethesda's event timing, the Halloween announcement never said the event would last THROUGH 12pm ET on 11/12. It said it would be available UNTIL 11/12.
---
That being said, even through that plain reading of the wording, Bethesda ended the event at least 4 hours early.
---
Ok. This thread has me rolling on the floor. Now back to my bush.
---
I ended up filing a request for a refund and got an instant response. They told me I had to prove that I had enough XP and they’ll give me the costume. I asked “how? there’s no way to track XP past 7k without the skeleton challenge tracker.” Customer service tells me, yes there is. Through the status menu of the pip boy. Me, believing that they know what they’re talking about, logs in to check. To no surprise of mine, there’s not a way to check. I send screenshots of this to them and they say, “We’ll send you over to another department to get this looked at and they’ll be emailing you soon. We don’t know how long until that happens” They really know nothing about their own game.
---
I literally haven't played in months I just follow this sub to see how this situation pans out
---
I tried solo bunker B when I was lvl 88 and went through all my stims, thousands of rounds of ammo trying to figure it out and couldn’t pull it off. Took days of grinding to get my resources back to pre attempt levels. 
---
I went back as a lvl120 with some stranger 110 and we burned bunker B up fast. I didn’t get to hit the buttons to launch the other guy did it. 
---
If your on PS4 and want to raid tonight I’ll help you hillbilly202 is my name. 
---
(I have never done vault 96 raid tried once solo died in 3rd room rage quit, if anyone would help I would be grateful)
---
So in my experience, this is not particularly true. A while ago I was playing with a hacker on my team. 
---
I reported him after we won. I only learned he was hacking after I got to spectate him for a while.
---
Your support banned my account, although thankfully for only a few days while you investigate. No one apologized to me or did anything for the week or so that I couldn't log in.
---
Now it makes me wonder... Would I have been temp banned if I didn't say that my team mate was cheating?
---
What about what happened yesterday where NW Halloween rewards event was seemingly ended prematurely? :( I was so close to pumpkin skin reward and then I thought I’d take a break and eat something for the first time all day... came back and the event thing had ended. I thought it was scheduled to last till the 12th which would b today? Please address this!
---
Yeah, I upscaled the Blade of Bastet
---
https://www.vgr.com/fallout-76-microtransactions-hines/   
---
They've gone back on their words omce. What's stopping them from doing it again?
---
Nope. Have the nuclear key card, but never did the quest yet. Completed “Scorched Earth” many times after others dropped nukes. 
---
One day, though....
---
So.... I'm currently away from my PC. What was patched that broke even more the game?
---
The wording that Bethesda used was that the Halloween rewards would be available UNTIL 11/12, rather than their traditional "through 12pm ET" on 11/12. Regardless, the event was cut 4 hours short even by the most liberal reading of the facts.
---
Is he going commando or rifleman?  For rifleman I’d want a BE (explosive) and whatever 3rd star he prefers.  For commando, B25 (faster fire rate) is superior.
---
Half the CAMP budget! Double the fun!
---
early, I used good with salt, cooked and ate frequently.  
---
Green thumb for double yield when farming plants.  
---
Soups do double duty as both food and water.
---
Some people like either carnivore or herbivore (can't be both)
---
I got Good doggy and a collection of canned dog food.   (and I'm high enough level where I don't worry too much about diseases and such...so will eat/drink anything, cooked or raw.  And I sell most everything except canned dog food.
---
That and I don't try to save food for performance boosts.
---
From my testing the Handmade does more damage than a Fixer for Rifleman builds.  For Commando builds, the Fixer does better.  I have all the main variants of both weapons (BE, B25).
---
I think you’re on point.
---
Why would a company want to give away their premium currency as an incentive to buy something else? Because that premium currency is about to (if not already) drop in value. They’re giving up on the idea of people buying Atoms. They’re trying to squeeze as much revenue out of Atoms before people stop buying them all together. 
---
Why would the value of Atoms drop and why would people stop buying them? Because people can’t use them for anything worthwhile. Because Bethesda isn’t supporting the Atom Shop with new interesting things to buy. They’re putting this game on life support, and devoting minimal resources (man hours) into it.
---
I am very interested in hearing what players who loved survival mode think about this post. 
---
I didn't want to play it so have no opinion but I'd love to hear what you survival mode players loved and hated about survival mode.
---
Isnt that the fallout 1st skin ?
---
Same problem on PC.
---
Upvoted just because Beth spoke directly to us. I had to double check the op, wow Beth speaks!
---
No, first has the normal range armor and now a green one. This has big ol armored shoulder pads like from the lonesome road dlc
---
Only spawning in one set location leads to spawn camping not so great when team dickwad decides to ruin the game for you
---
You can run around with a nerf blaster shooting someone 20times to down them and have fun but other people want to play a sniper crouched down on the grassy knoll waiting for the perfect moment to give your dome a sunroof 
---
This is a RPG with pvp tacked on people want to play different and use different gear just cause they don't want to play a pubg, fortnight cod clone, doesnt make their playstyle wrong just means you're playing the wrong game. Let them play stealth predator types and snipers and psycho machete weilders
---
20 players but yeah this is not normalo
---
People suck. Idk how they know though, unless they see you place your survival tent. Do you have your icon as one of the F1st icons?
---
You can always a nukashine and see where you end up.
---
Do you have All Rise?
---
Passive mode should be turned on and no one will know if you purchased fallout first unless your st your survival camp
---
Yeah, it probably was. The community isn’t too happy about pay to win, or those that support it.
---
Ah yes, Bethesda customer support.  Should really call it something else lol
---
I launched one just after level 50 with a friend I leveled with. Back then everything when everything was super laggy, and it made it tough to clear. Not sure if anything has changed since then. I launched a few since then when I still played. We only did it because we thought it would be fun to decimate an area and see what secrets they might hold.
---
"You found an issue and let us know about it? Great! NEVER LOOK AGAIN!"
---
It could've just been random griefers. Don't return fire just hop servers if they get irritating. They can't do anything otherwise. I'm sorry you had to go through that though.
---
I am about to trade with someone for a jet pack, is it worth it?
---
TSE is not worth buying unless it’s WAY below normal retail price in-game. The accuracy is atrocious. Quad Explosive is a pretty great post- Drum nerf, but not for a Bloodied build.
---
haha awesome, well played!
---
I'm lvl 78 and I've launched at least 7 nukes
---
It shouldnt be needed , but cant you go to a private world ?  again this shouldnt be happening but there isnt much you can do about it - maybe reporting ? - i dunno
---
“Nuclear Winter Updates
---
Happy Halloween, Candidates!
---
New Seasonal Rewards: Unlock six new Halloween-themed cosmetic rewards by completing limited-time Nuclear Winter Challenges from October 29 through November 12.”
---
Per the patch notes.
---
Sell all your drugs and glowing meat if you’re not using them. Also prioritize what junk you actually use. Bulk rubber sells decently and it’s found on pretty much everything. Do your dailies. Combine those things and I was hitting my 1400 caps everyday. I now hover around 20k caps.
---
Peasants.
---
There are already many hundreds of existing assets in the game they can reuse. Walk around Appalachia see what I'm talking about. Instead they're making brand new ones that also look "brand new" fresh out of factory. Unless there's a factory still maintained by oblivious robots I cant see how brand new looking wallpapers would fit it.
---
Level 120 and never launched a nuke...attempted it twice and never succeeded and couldn't be bothered after that lol
---
Turn on pacifist mode and never fire back. They can’t do anything to you then.
---
I’ve also heard that the Electrically Charged and Unstable Isotope mutations can trigger pvp even with pacifist on, so avoid getting those.
---
Take my upvote and thank you for sharing.
---
ok - i see
---
Almost, I die a lot. I think I’m on the final step
---
Like a plan, a physical jet pack, or jet pack crafting service. And what are you trading for it?
---
Jet pack will be worth it because I’m confident that they will fix this bug soon. Also, jet packs still sort of work right now. The bug only happens randomly. Often,  but randomly. So you can still get some use out of having a jet pack. 
---
Tell me the details of that transaction and I’ll let you know if they’re ripping you off or not.
---
Keeps happening. I crashed 2x the last 2 games.
---
Most likely, I had them confused when I first heard the plasma was rare.
---
I tweeted and submitted feedback ticket. Fat lot of good I expect it to do.
---
Go ahead, bethesda. Change by mind.
---
There are bunch of trolls on public server.
---
I don't think it was espacially because of you being first.
---
Maybe they just saw you were low level, and destroying your camp while you being building it seems fun to them...
---
Those guys can only destroy your camp if you engage pvp with them. They will probably also try to force you to.
---
I recommand you to go to your settings and set you in pacific mode in your early game, you'll be safe then.
---
I had one person twice.[https://imgur.com/gallery/E00MN6Y](https://imgur.com/gallery/E00MN6Y)
---
I think it's pretty obvious what happened here. They cut survival out and they're using that server some how for private servers. It was something to do will money I just know it. It's not like they didn't know how to fix it so they got rid of it.
---
I think you may be misunderstanding the point I was making. I keep a gun on my melee characters too for low level trash stuff for fun, I’m not saying you can’t do it, I’m saying you can’t cross class and be fully optimal and while you can certainly play around with some stuff when you get to an end game build, you shouldn’t try to evenly cross class from the start. You cannot be optimal in both melee and rifles. You have to primarily focus around one weapon type and base your build off of that. A purely focused build with the same weapons, gear, and mutations is always going to be stronger at that thing and do more damage 100% of the time than a cross class build. -A lot- of new players make this mistake and then have to spend time trying to re-spec later.
---
[Here is a link of exactly that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/duzahf/fallout_76_players_do_not_report_exploits/) People are totally pushing the narrative of "Bethesda is banning people who report".
---
No one believes anything you say anymore bethesda, you ruined peoples trust, just stop.
---
Ages ago, someone at Bethesda had the programming competence to script a human NPC that could open doors, probably for Morrowind. The ancient knowledge has been lost now and all those that remain can do is copy+paste, rename and change the 3D art to a roach.
---
fuk bugthesda!
---
I just had a match that contained four people.  The catch.  All four people were ON THE SAME TEAM.  We all just stood in the circle till the very end, till eventually the firestorm killed us and we won 1st place.    
---
I've never encountered this before.  My lowest match would probably have been around 20 people, but today something is wrong.  Even the match I was playing when servers shut down earlier was around 40 people.
---
Conspiracy theory... It was 12pm EST, and then the rollback of daylights saving time pushed it to 11am, but they're code kept the PM. And switched timezones a few times just to be consistent.
---
What fucking Nuka Cola lights... God damn this game sucks, I have a Nuka Cola themed house and my ign is Nuka-Cola. I would have instantly bought them if i had known.
---
They specifically said dont use the cheat engines. It sucks that they were banned, but it's pretty cut and dry.
---
thats not how humans work but ok
---
Something is broken, that's for sure.  Just did a match with four people total.. We were all the same team...
---
Are you on Xbox? I got a level 35 quad handmade you can have it’s nothing flash but it’s free and would probably do you till you reach lvl 50 and have better weapon options.
---
I can just see the leadership meeting that led up to this post lol.
---
Fun story.
---
I've never even seen one launched. I'm almost level 90, and I've been playing almost 5 months now.
---
Never launched until last weekend so i stocked up on stims and ammo and boy it was t Hard but The enemy were tanky
---
Also used to make end game underarmors. Sure you know that but I havnt seen anyone mention it for the noobs.
---
I'm level 151, very casual, I've been in the silos just to peek around, but no launch for me yet. Maybe I'll try this weekend.
---
I've yet to launch a nuke as well
---
People can charge whatever they want. I thought the trend of ragging on people for their pricing was finished? Occasionally for rare plans I charge a large amount of Caps. Typically list common Plans at 50% base value and rare plans up to 2000% base value. Not following any sort of pricing guide, just doing my own thing but it's all a learning experience. People have to learn how to be good at business through experimentation, not being scolded or called out on the internet.
---
I was looking at the Inside the Vault, which is more specific about the NW rewards. There, it says something different: "Be sure to complete all six challenges soon, because they're only available until November 12."
---
"Until" would mean a hard stop as soon as we reach 11/12, but even still, 11/11 @ 8pm ET isn't 11/12. Your post goes to show even further that Bethesda was misleading.
---
Bethesda should add it as a free Atom Shop item through November.
---
Why do you buy the 1st membership and play on a public server xD The whole reason for buying that is to play alone in a empty world. Wtf just wtf
---
Speak for yourself
---
Naw, this goes beyond that.  Something is broken.  Just had a 4 man match, except all 4 men were the same team.  The match did not end till we all died in the fire at the very end and won 1st place.
---
Give me MODUS plush immediately.
---
Pacifist negates pvp with aoe mutations
---
Glad I played the hell out of Hide and Seek last week and got my glowing spooky outfit before the weekend... I learned my lesson by trying to get into the purveyor sale and missing it 12 hours before it officially ended.
---
If it does have a limit it might be monthly.. I haven’t seen anything saying anything about this though
---
 I keep a gun to shoot stuff with. As I have a good Hunter Exploder Handmade I bring down Scorchbeasts with it. My Instigating Lever Action, somewhat nerfed, still puts out into the 400s with a Stealth Bonus.
---
 None of this hurts my knives at all.
---
Came close once, but I was missing an access key or something, right at the end.  I've played about 200 levels across 4 characters
---
that wasn’t the main factor in why I bought it. it is a bonus I hope to use though.
---
5k for xo1 jp
---
&gt;he said he reported an exploit through proper channels and they banned him? was he lying? or...?
---
He never said that. Go to his website and read his statements.
---
&gt;Someone from my group stated that they already reported it to one of the community managers in our group, so I just left it.
---
He never reported it. He got banned the next day. After multiple days of testing the exploit with Cheat Engine.
---
ah i see! thank you for the reply
---
True. I try not to sell super common Plans that everyone has but if someone happens across an Assault Rifle or Lead Pipe Plan for 10-20k they might think the Vendor is over charging, personally I'd buy both in a heartbear
---
Yeah you're right those loot crates are awful. And the sweet BE Handmade I got from the Atomic shop totally P2W.
---
I haven't.  186 and 80ish.  Never one on either.  I hope it's not necessary to start Wastelanders, but may have to knock one out at some point just to have it done.
---
Or maybe because someone reported your team?
---
and for those that can't be asked to open up the game during the content drought.
---
im just going by the info he posted here on this reddit sub directly
---
&gt;Good people were banned for using third party programs with the sole intent of confirming and reporting exploits to you.
---
The guy everyone is talking about used a 3rd party cheat engine and may have had the intent to report it...but he never actually reported it. So he got banned and then everyone jumped on the bandwagon.
---
Let me throw this out there for anyone that cares to read. First off, I'm not affected personally by any bans, nor do I do any of the things that have triggered some of these. But I do know a bit about them. The third party software, called cheat engine, is just a name. It might as well have been called Memory Reader, as that's what it does. It allows you to read and write directly to memory. This has the purpose of allowing you to see what the game is actually doing or has in memory at that second. The other use is people writing things to memory causing the game to do things it wasn't intended, like duping items among other things.
---
Say someone hears through the grapevine that there's a new exploit involving the purveyor. Is that it? Is that all that's supposed to be reported? "heard it from a friend, who heard it from a friend...."  How helpful is that? Think that will help Bethesda fix anything or will even get a ticket replied to? No, instead people dig into it. They use cheat engine to see what's going on under hood. They try some things. Next thing you know, they've been using it for hours trying to figure it out. They finally figure out what the exploit is, repeat it, try variations, experiment with fixes, etc, then report to Bethesda. Lather, rinse, repeat for the next exploit. This is basic debugging and computer troubleshooting.
---
Action on the part of Bethesda needs to be more than the letter of the law. If people are using and abusing these exploits to gain an unfair advantage, crash servers, grief other players, etc, then yes, definitive action should be taken. But for those that have a history of finding these and reporting them, a different approach should be taken. NW cheaters are given 72-hour temp bans while people finding exploits and reporting them are given perm bans. Something is wrong with this picture.

Behind pay wall
---
It was still before 7pm est :(
---
Well the plan does cost about that much from the enclave vendor. If you don’t care about having the ability to craft it yourself, I guess that’s a decent price.
---
He didn't report the exploit/bug at all. From his website:
---
&gt;Someone from my group stated that they already reported it to one of the community managers in our group, so I just left it. My account got a ban the next day.
---
How can Bethesda make fallout 76 good
---
The take a pic at fissure site doesn't work either. Also the daily to kill a legendary at a fissure didn't work.
---
I was closely lining is there is any spelling difference, I was so surprised it’s not a troll post 😳
---
No there is the atoms you get, the stash, the outfits AND you get the private server. Don’t be a dick.
---
Ah, ok. Good to know.
---
SOME people in the community.
---
Then he must have lied. That 2nd quote is from his own web page at map76.
---
Cause we can do both. Personally some days a I play alone, some days I join others. We get the best of both worlds.
---
Why should he need to go private?
---
Never have here either?
---
That's exciting to you? Shit I must be playing NW right then... I immediately undress my character and hide in bushes. The colors blend better to be camouflaged rather than the bright blue vault suit.
---
There are 2 types of player vendors it seems.  Players who price everything way too high and players who have reasonable prices.  Oops the third kind are the ones who stock their machines with non legendary armor and weapons.  Lol.
---
Honestly this happened prior to 1st as well, some people are just raiders.
---
I launched my first nuke the other day in NW
---
I'm grasping at straws. I literally do not know how this could have transpired.
---
That doesn't mean changing anything.
---
There was only ever 2 maybe 3 survival servers available max on Xbox at least....
---
Why must everything look like all of us best and brightest cant find a fucking brillo pad and some paint? Hey Bethesda how about making some skins that don't look like we painted our armor and weapons and then buried them for 50 years?!?
---
im pretty sure the wastelanders delay caught them with their pants down
---
patch 15 is definitely gonna be really interesting
---
Dude, fucking forbes was running a story on it for the last two days spouting this same “banned for reporting” bullshit.
---
I agree. A lot of newer players have things priced really high or really low.  Sometimes I pop over to a low levels camp and buy all their stuff just so they can make a few caps.  As long as their prices are reasonable.
---
(Unlimited amount of times)
---
Did you unequip fireproof?
---
you actually believe this bullshit? i dont get why people blindly follow this game anymore i really dont
---
We need to be able to display Power Armor... It's already scattered among the world. Why can't it be in our camp?
---
I do agree that people can price their stuff the way they want, but I'm seeing a lot of high-end camps charging 2c for .38, 10c for purified water and 1000c+ for 1\* legendaries that are clearly good just for scrips and nothing more, and I always laugh when I see it. But it is what it is, caps aren't worth shit anymore...

---
I see they have found a way to exclude cheaters from participating. Bravo!
---
Wow, you must be completely illiterate.
---
&gt;I have my issues with the game, as do a lot of folks, but I don't go trolling Twitter or Reddit about it
---
This.
---
i said he shouldnt need to - but if he want to be sure of privacy that is an option, he did pay for that after all.  There are other suggestions too in this post - such as staying in passive mode .  There isnt really much to do about bullies
---
Stick to playing the game and avoid talking about stuff you know nothing about, thats my advice to you.
---
Really?! It would have been nice if the Atom shop was more explicit about this when posting pictures. I see they are now doing so with the Corvega turret paint.
---
Just a total lack of communication. Why not have a countdown clock on events like this, all problems solved. I know Beth well enough to go overboard on timed things. Half the time you have to find a work around or at least clarification on which outfit/location actually works.  In game info, loading screen or a special pip boy page, let us know a couple days in advance of downtime,   give us patch notes in game, communicate!
---
 **The Good:** The community that comes together to help you out.  
---
**The Bad:** The level 250+ players who constantly kill your level 55 bloody build over and over again.  
---
**The Ugly:**  Fallout 1st
---
I disagree with the free atom shop item though. I really did put so much time into earning that costume and wanted it to be my trophy, like “Hell yeah I got 14,000XP, sorry you didn’t.” Making it free to everyone would still negate all the time players spent on these rewards.
---
I go farm alone but explore and play on public
---
Yeah ok 😝 I suppose I am trolling the trolls who keep trolling on twitter
---
*Grabs coat...*
---
Also, some food, like Blamco Mac &amp; Cheese, won't spoil no matter how much time passes. Hold on to those for the long term and eat the stuff that actually will spoil ASAP.
---
They don't say they have a time limit on them, except the green ranger skin, or that's what I remember seeing, I'll have to check when I am at home
---
Great question I dont have the answer but so far nothing has gone away they just added a riot ranger outfit today but the orginal is still available
---
I like the name, one amazing anime and character lol
---
And I agree with your statement, some people are just raiders. Or have a different play style.
---
Lvl 80, I've launched 4, a youtuber named RifleGaming is like lvl 300, and his youtube career was to launch nukes for a while
---
Wastelanders will be free. Zero chance it is not free.
---
Only if you have a bounty. Then you can bring a player with passive into a fight. If you are sparky and the wanted player hits you.
---
That’s what I’m doing to grind xp: https://youtu.be/dsnWFaf6A4I
---
Apart from that I’m rolling my legendary at purveyor on all 5 characters
---
At the barely least they should give an extension.
---
The good: great looking game with a fantastic community.
---
The bad: bugs, bugs everywhere
---
The ugly: broken promises and P2W mechanics.
---
Really I mean dropping tons of aid items also ruined it lol. Everytime someone died they lost a good bit.
---
Hell, even some scorched or super mutants running around in turkey costumes would be fun. Just have it be a wave event with increasing levels of enemies with the final wave having a big behemoth in a turkey suit.
---
It is amusing how much people try to charge. Some guy wanted 5000 for the barn building set. Next person had it for 25. Bought everything i could off the second person, left the original a bag of spoiled meat.
---
Just like there was zero chance the atomic would having anything but cosmetics.
---
No I can read. You must be whooooshed
---
There's no P2W items in the game. Paid convenience yes. Win? Not so much 
---
No loot crates or paid weapons.
---
I'd explain it like your five but that might be a bit much.
---
Crossing my fingers for you ... at least you were able to get further along in the support process than them saying they didn't have any way to address it.
---
High radiation fluids are so scarce I usually end up with way too much raw flux in the end......pisses me off.
---
Half the walls in the bungalow do that also. Might be a wall paper thing. Was patched once already. They got our money and still it's not patched.
---
how does it not mean anything?
---
regardless fucking with cheat engine is a insta ban in many online games
---
Nothing game altering is in the atomic shop. There is no advantage to any of the utility items in the shop. If you think someone using a repair kit to repair their weapon to 100% is an advantage to me using a workbench and repairing to 200% is an advantage, I don’t know what to tell you. 
---
Believe what you want. The good news is, it doesn’t matter what you believe because wastelanders will still be free.
---
Never have but I'm level 45
---
Does tank killer work with
---
 pipe rifle perk along with pistol perks?
---
Was I there because that just happened about an hour ago  on PS4 I went to Reddit to if anyone was posting about it
---
what is the problem with my suggestion ?  i clearly say  - that it is the behavior of the others that is the problem - even suggest he may repport them.    But if he want privacy it is an option to go to a private world.   What is your suggestion ?
---
I'm a responder guy but dang I would sure like to see more faction stuff in the atom shop.  The only responder things I got were a power armor paint job, a fire axe skin, and a pump shotgun skin.  Were there other things??
---
Game Files have 9 Variations of the Ranger Armor. Grey (Standard), Riot (Green), and Desert with each of those having a Standard, Advanced, and Elite variant. The Standard Grey was the initial unlock for 1st and then Standard Riot was released as a free paint for 1st subs.
---
I enjoyed it immensely when it had fewer people but it seems like whatever the issue is was fixed
---
Collectron will help you start adquiring junk you will eventually need to upgrade gear/eaps, or, you could save for any cool PA skin, depends on how much you value convenience vs cosmetic.  Also if you need help, feel free to add me ign: Phantom987 im mostly solo but i can join you.
---
Remove your perks and reequip them. This has happened to other players before.
---
I didn't see any responder stuff today. Maybe I missed it.  I will have to check after work.
---
Same prices and I can agree.
---
I attempted thrice but failed because of the effin' bugs! First try, the cores are getting removed from my inventory. Second and third tries, bots became invincible and they keep on increasing, and those Mr. Handies' attacks hurts.
---
I'm level 80 btw.
---
Commando and yeah good analysis
---
That's the thing, you have no right to your side of the story. They say don't do something, and you do it, doesn't matter why. Ban!
---
Thank you for the responses everyone!
---
My first time I didn’t know how long it would take so was out of food and water by the end. All my guns broke so all I had was the gutter. 
---
I spent the whole time slowly chopping away at assaultrons and gusties, then putting the wrong code in 5 times. No stims, no food, no water, Xo1 and a gutter.
---
The same way ghouls can run while laying down.
---
If they came out with a dual wild pistol card then they would so good at 2x the stats pretty much.
---
Little late for those who couldn't finish the NW Halloween objs on PC. Late in general. Also if we can't get simple hot fixes on minor issues in a timely manner how are we supposed to believe you're properly sussing out exploiters from those who are trying to provide you with details and accuracy pertaining to bugs. If someone was actively testing a bug or trying to replicate it for reporting purposes I highly doubt that Bethesda cares enough to differentiate
---
Not with the current camp budgets 😅
---
They told somebody else on twitter that they were putting together a specialized team for that specific issue. We got this far along by submitting tickets for billing issues/refunds. They respond lightning fast and with a real person.
---
Right but your rifle build isn’t optimized, there is no way to cross class and optimize both.
---
Oh God forgive me that I didn't want gameplay changing elements behind a paywall and that I'm pissed with Pete Hines lying to their loyal player base. How rude of me to suggest that the a solution to the limited Stashbox of which everyone's been complaining about not be monetised so that all players have equal footing when it comes to gameplay.
---
Just stop with that bullshit.
---
This does effect all of us because buying into this 1st crap tells Bethesda to carry on with their greedy ways. I shouldn't have to pay extra just to not worry about scrap ever again. That's no right and it's not fair.
---
Monetise the servers and some cosmetics, cause I'm more fine with that and I understand servers cost money to run.
---
This shit however crosses the line when I can't even earn certain items through grinding Atoms.
---
Go ahead and downvote this post like the rest of 1st supporters here.
---
I'm fucking done with this subreddit.
---
I got real close one time at like level 90 but it eventually got to be too overwhelming without a party. Fuck soloing that, leave it to the pros.
---
Legacy energy weapons deal higher explosive damage than normal guns.. Please tell me you already knew that. That's what makes up for the low base damage.
---
Please just go test it
---
I always stay in pacifist mode. There would not have been a problem with FO1st if Beth would have done it more intelligently. 
---
1. Allow everyone the junk stash box - coders agree that it wouldn’t affect servers. Beth lied.
---
2. Don’t create FO1st content just available for FO1st - such as the ranger armor. Every person who plays this wanted that armor, Beth created the target for only making it for one group.
---
3. People need to quit being such bitches about people paying for FO1st.
---
I ran it solo and launched on fissure prime.  No one showed up so I couldn't beat the queen.  If there aren't high levels around I usually just do whitesprings or Harpers Ferry to farm leggos and flux.
---
Are you going to address the issue with the Nuclear Winter halloween challenges ending early? I spent a week grinding for that 14k, and was on my last match with 4 hours to go when it disappeared.
---
Hahah
---
I am glad I say this post. Jet packs are whack and have been for months. I got tired of it always going off during any jump.
---
yes! and skinned half/quarter floor pieces too
---
Hey man rant on and put words in people mouth all day if you want. I'm pointing out the fact that initially the atomic shop was designed for cosmetics and cosmetics only. They have changed that. You just said yourself that they sell utility as well now. That's going back on your word, regardless of the reasons, that's what it is. They said wastelanders will be free, yes I have read that too. That can change as well.
---
Click bait title, there has been little to no backlash against FO1st players in game, there was one post on reddit the day after first was announced and since then it’s been the subject of a gajillion YouTube videos made by lazy idiots. The mere fact that both players have to opt in to fight each other is the main reason it’s a pointless and futile task for anyone to dedicate their time to. The simple fact is that you got griefed by people who were a higher level than you because you were a lower level than them. Then you retaliated therefore allowing them to grief you. I’m sorry it happened but don’t blame the subscription when you made the decision to fight a group of higher level players at your base.
---
I don’t think there is any current weapon dupes. And if there is, almost no one knows about it.
---
Yes but people generally lose Flux after the sbq fight due to the delay in the final wave during the sbq last breath.
---
I did too. But the possum badges show up when you access the ever upwards vending machines.  I didn't have time to check the scrip though.
---
Most things are being hoarded rn as we are in a major content drought. Every now and then you find a good deal, but it’s sparse.
---
This. Please say something. Anything. At least tell us to shove off. I just want to know if my countless hours of grinding were worth it.
---
You're telling me at any given time only what, 72 people roughly could play survival at a time?
---
They have been, man. Think about why they would release this statement. It's to quell all the rumors
---
It doesn’t increase the range just the spread. So let’s say the range is 20ft, you’ll just do more damage across that same distance because you’re hitting more bullets on the same target. But beyond 20ft it’s going to drop off the same either way
---
I'm not even subbed to this reddit, I just come here to see all of the people bashing the game (all of which is deserved).
---
I haven't played in months, but I'm determined to get my $30 worth of entertainment by shitting on this dumpster fire of a game whenever possible.
---
🤣🤣🤣
---
"You're finally awake eh?"
---
Still no sign of Nuka Cola Fridge.
---
Well I've got no reason to log in still.
---
How do you know they arent being wrongfully accused by begrudging employees.
---
See that’s what I’m saying. An example I have is marine armor a lot of people are at 3k caps each piece . I found all 3 parts for 300 each for a total of 900 which I felt good about and that’s a good come up for the player vendor . Almost a days worth of caps
---
I’m telling you that at any given time there was a max of 72 people playing survival on Xbox. It was more in the line of 36-48.
---
So, your argument of they killed it to reuse the servers don’t really add up is all.
---
I was kind of bummed about map guy ban until I realized it wasn't the map guy I thought it was..
---
I’ve never launched a nuke cause I always felt like i was underpowered and no one would run it with me
---
Companions are supposed to be coming with wastelanders but basically they will just have their individual story missions that you do with them and then they sit at your camp. Won’t be wandering around with you everywhere

Even though the ghouls will be glowing, you won't get the materials needed for crafting stabilized flux. Same issue when the Burrows get a nuked. Seems that you need out door glowing ghouls vs the indoor / underground ghouls to get fluids and mass. Whitesprings is still the king for farming that stuff
---
Does it revert back to it's original spot once I leave?
---
Yeah except Bethesda hasn't asked anyone to find exploits, just report exploits they find. In your scenario, you hear about it all you should do is say that's wack. Maybe encourage the person who experienced it to report it. Sure you're doing Bethesda a favor by figuring it all out but again they didn't ask for that so don't go digging. Now if YOU experience an exploit, you report it, let Bethesda figure out the details don't keep exploiting it to figure it out. No ban for you!
---
I've been looking for a skin for my handmade ever since I got it.
---
But - i wasnt suggestion him to go to a private world if he didnt want to.  He had a specific problem and was looking for options to keep playing .   Apart from staying in passive - the rest of your suggestions is up to bethesda - they wont solve his problems now.   I still dont know what was wrong with my suggestion -  is was a attempt to sovle a problem right now .   Ideally nobody would attack other players for being subscribers ( or other reasons outside pvp).
---
Check out some player vendors. I see lots of great stuff being sold everyday!
---
Well you had to buy the coat with that E3 Atoms bundle, so it doesn’t really count.
---
Can’t even QA their spelling correctly.
---
Only 48 people were playing Survival at a time? I hope you don't honestly believe that.
---
People are outrageous with their prices, some dude tried charging me 5k caps for a single 1* Unyeilding arm
---
Having DLC/expansions is the core of fallout 76. The whole reason they expanded to utility items is to preserve that core. The utility items still do not alter the game and are in the spirit of “cosmetic”, in the sense thy they don’t give a player an advantage over someone else who doesn’t pay (a key part of the article where he talks about the atomic shop). 
---
They aren’t going to destroy the core of the game. Doing so... would actually destroy the game. 
---
Wastelanders will be free. Do you actually believe it won’t? Or are you just trolling?
---
Just unsub already.
---
I'm gunna launch one soon, I just made officer in enclave... but I'm 140 too, lol, I only want it for private servers and farming, horde legendaries with my cripple vampire explosive shotgun, muah ha ha ha ha!
---
You can always use the technical data versions?
---
I would quit 100%. I’ve acquired items for the past 10 months from totally legit ways of caps and trade. I think every serious player has several duped items. I would lose almost every good weapon I have; be laser, be handmade, aae handmade, unyielding wwr set, be lever, aae lever, ve handmade, bloodied SS +1 strength power fist and dcg, just to name a few! I know 10 other people that have very similar inventory’s. So you are correct, to even say “wiping all duped items is a good idea” is ignorant as hell. And your also correct that as far as the “economy” goes (caps circulating) all those duped items did more good than bad. No one sells good items, they only trade. Which makes caps worthless, generally speaking of coarse.
---
“I see this as an absolute win!”
---
Not working on my DCG. Already had to fix it.
---
Just try to remember to take Good with Salt OFF when you are trying to Ferment Alcohol in your backpack,
---
Yup! Also handy to just make Corn Soup for hunger and thirst, or something similar, sell everything else to the Bots.
---
How many updates are left this year?
---
I'm level 83 and only launched a nuke in NW I might do it later this week for a challenge
---
I hear ya :(   
---
I want that one myself
---
If you couldn't manage to get your $30s worth, you're doing it wrong 😜
---
I'm Level 46 and launched my first Nike yesterday
---
Q-Bug or new feature?
---
A-yes
---
Right so you skimmed about 8 words off the article then regurgitated the same bs you were spouting off before. Good one. Well if you could read you would have gotten to this part “All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76,” explains Hines; “all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff, is going to be free. That’s important. And to say, the Atomic Shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand. Look, there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we’re going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right.”
---
On Xbox that was what I noticed &amp; I played daily,
---
Can’t speak for pc &amp; PlayStation.
---
I’m not saying only 48 people played survival, i am saying at any given time when I played survival there seemed to only be several survival servers open at a time.
---
why isn't this pinned ?
---
Strange, even weapons I'm pulling from my Stash aren't losing durability.
---
you know what thats actually a good idea
---
Lol, have fun thinking over a couple thousand people play this game
---
Works wonders!
---
Nah Bethesda deserve it after how they've fucked their loyal fanbase.
---
Redefining "Battle Royal" 😂
---
Most of the hate comes from people who quit long ago or never even played.  I have plenty of stuff I'm salty about but I still really enjoy Fallout 76.
---
Relatively new player, level 19. I was in Morgantown doing the Nukashine quest and got the alert for a nuke dropping down. I was in the basement of the speakeasy though, so decided to wait it out. Sure enough, was left unscathed. :)
---
Lol. That was sarcasm. It was a bitch. We both had PA, weapons, and almost all nuke codes. He had nothing. Just sat there naked.... And avoided us forever. Just crouch moving to not get detected.
---
I helped in a moral support capacity, I had the key card and friend had the explosive 2shot
---
On the last sale tab, the items with a discount change everyday throughout the week.
---
Haha really? You're missing out on the best part
---
Level 62 on my main, haven't launched a nuke and haven't really farmed any nuke zones either. I don't see the point since farming legendaries just leads to farming more legendaries to no greater purpose (I keep hearing SBQ has crappy loot).
---
The game really needs a handful of meaty endgame encounters with really rare gear/medicine/camp/etc. drops... then I'd have a reason! :P
---
My weapons are degrading as normal
---
Thanks for the info
---
What system are you on, team up with people that makes it easier to take on the wanted people, I hope it's just people pretending to be Raiders, I'm not even a 1st but I plan on PlayStation 4 and my campus been destroyed a few times sometimes I think it might be because I'm camping in a location they might also use but there's no way for me to really know but I've moved my Camp a few times two avoid situations
---
Level 130 and I've launched dozens. Most of my levels came from running nuke launches with friends. Have them protect me and I get experience for killing stiff. Just make sure I shot everything I saw at least once and go from there
---
No duh. I have a few of them. Im well aware. You're seriously gonna sit here and tell me the 9-15 extra damage that Explosive adds is a meaningful enough amount to compensate for the low base damage? Especially given that Beam Spliiter is going to have that same 9 explosive damage except x4. Get out of here with that crazy talk. Energy Weapons dont even benefit from Demo Expert to begin with either. Please tell me you already knew that. 
---
Stop trying to spread disinformation, or, instead of shifting the burden of proof to me, why dont YOU show me your results? Hm?
---
Removing that, BoS is technically the most represented faction in the game.  Maybe competition with Raiders, if you count both bundles.  Enclave barely gets any love.
---
Alright anyone who thinks cosmetics and utility items are the same are just the definition of ignorant. I'm done with this
---
I played the mode since it came out till when it closed on Xbox. I was a top player on the mode (not that it matters)
---
When it comes down to it the big issue with the mode is there was zero incentive or reward for staying in the top 3.
---
Balance issues aside of course &amp; there were many. 
---
They should have never allowed anyone to bring in existing characters/items into survival. It should have been a brand new character just like nuclear winter.
---
Had they done that I believe much more people would have played &amp; many of the balance issues as stated above would not have been a problem.
---
Just my two cents. I’d personally love to see a Survival seasons mode at some point, but will prob never happen.
---
I suspect that they have some sort of PVP planed ala wastlanders dlc that we haven’t seen yet...:
---
&gt; Nobody ever said you were banning people just for reporting bugs/exploits.
---
I'm sorry, have we been reading the same sub lately?
---
ok
---
I can hold onto your scrap while you are gone if you want.
---
Been looking for some flux lol
---
That's all games for me now. I'm really bored of it. Started playing on my phone more. But even that gets dull after a bit
---
I was alone on both occasions.[https://imgur.com/gallery/E00MN6Y](https://imgur.com/gallery/E00MN6Y)
---
You have no idea what you're talking about, its as simple as that.
---
Some games might check for the CE process, but it isn't an insta bad. As he said, he uses CE to reverse engineer the game. Reading memory adresses and scanning values isn't ban-worthy nor does it change the program. Changing values is ban worthy.
---
Now the question is, are you being disingenuous on purpose or just ignorant?
---
I never said it was wrong. I must have taken the time from the message for him to go private if he had issues. My bad.
---
If it's that bad for you I'd recommend relocating your camp.
---
Lmao oh you expected private servers to be free? 😂😂
---
Okay 🖒 yeah costs them more but nah why pay who does that. 
---
You're worst than the Cosmetics only people.
---
I’d say wait for wastelanders. I just came back last week and I’m enjoying it as I suppose you used to. I guess the end game is kinda boring if it’s the only game you play. It’s very repetitive. Go boot up another game for a few months and come back for wastelanders
---
Could have been, I'm on PS4 too, but I don't recognise or remember the name, sorry :)  
---
&lt; kuraidark
---
I’m on Xbox one, I really haven’t seen many people trying to team up.
---
The whole team was reported? Even though 2 were dead with 0 kills, and I was dead with 1 kill... While he had 20+ kills?
---
I find that highly unlikely.
---
If your active on this subreddit then you know how little anyone cares.
---
I cannot tell for sure as I did not try this yet, but it seems so according to [this old thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aarthc/do_pipe_weapons_really_benefit_from_pistol_and/), unless there have been changes since then. One comment there also claims that pistol perks only work on pipe revolver and bolt-action rifles.
---
No, don't ban them - they'll just steal another account and continue. Once a player is determined to be a cheater match them only with other cheaters.
---
I'm willing to believe that the map dude wasn't banned just for finding and reporting an exploit. I don't think Bethesda is malicious or utterly incompetent on this point. 
---
However, stating that players will never be banned for reporting issues implies that false positives don't happen, and that's something that seems a bit wrong. These mistakes will definitely happen, so it would have been nice to hear if the dude's ban was reviewed and confirmed as being issued for repeated abuse, or if there was indeed a false positive flag.
---
That's exactly how I feel too. I love the game but I just dont have anything to do anymore. Ive built my character up, got all of the weapons I want and finished all of the content... I'm just bored now..
---
I've never bothered. Someone else has always had one launching or launched when I get on.
---
People have been requesting this from day one. Either Bethesda doesn’t like money or their marketing team is delusional. 
---
Instead, they are releasing a whole slew of communist themed items and bundles. Because that was obviously super requested. Thanks Austin studio comrades, together we will resist! *rolls eyes*
---
So suicide is the way out.....now I'm really confused, my life is a lie?!?
---
Not on T-51b
---
PC .. Just had to fix mine. Not checking out for me.
---
ok - i just keep getting down votes - so someone must think my suggestion is wrong- just trying to find out why .
---
I've played over 1700 hours
---
I too have never launched a nuke
---
Enclave has their officers outfit, forest and urban operative under armor, forest and urban scout armor,  X-01 and Hellfire armor. Not to mention a base with vendors and a ridiculous amount of defense and Serums.
---
I consider them pretty close as far as included content.
---
The worst part about the included BoS paints is that they don't even match the ranks Taggerdy was using or the power armor they were using.
---
Oh god, I bet some piece of functionality that they use to spawn Fallout 1st scrubs into "private" servers somehow got accidentally merged into the NW matchmaking and is sending people to empty lobbies.
---
i remember the perks from the BETA actually. they only got removed upon launch i believe
---
Never. Played since BETA.
---
So far, I’ve gotten the SB kill and the Fissure picture at the same spot (Southwest of Whitesprings), just make sure you use the photo mode cause my camera didn’t register. I’ve collected two codes while using the Enclave code tracker and neither of them have registered. Trying it find a Flamer or plan now to see if that works. Trying to get enough for that Plague Doctor mask before it slips through my finger tips again.
---
Maybe when you activate some of the old ham radios lying around you start hearing voices every once and a while

&gt;.also good to know, if y
---
Anyone else get an issue with teh keypads constantly telling you to unlock the other one and doing nothing?
---
Time to farm levels taking advantage of the placement xp then.
---
It’s limited to ten each, I noticed
---
I'm fine with both, but ESO has so much content as to be silly. Exponentially more then 76, so issues and peeves aside, there is a ton of fun things to do b4 you get bored. While with 76, mostly just lurking till Wastelanders.
---
He literally says he messed with the memory
---
I don't know why you'd put it on the entire community because some people were fucking with you. Theres some nice, smart and funny people in this game and theres some real serious dumbfuck assholes in the game, It's just like reallife! That being said, don't let one shitty encounter erase any and all good encounters you've had. Put pacisfist mode on and switch servers if this shit happens again, but I bet it wont for quite awhile.
---
Also, people seems to be saying nobody can know you're a First Citizen unless you have a tent up. Theres plenty of ways, Your player icon, doing dances/emotes from the subscription, having that NCR-- Sorry, I mean Riot Outfit on, or even having a scrapbox placed in your camp... So people can tell... Not that they would harrass you because of it, but simple because they're assho-- Raiders, Yeah, they're raiders.
---
This is so Bethesda.
---
Thanks for the link, this is solid info!
---
I run with the Herbivore mutation and have watermelons planted at my camp. Restores a significant amount of both thirst &amp; hunger without any cooking. 
---
Couple that with the green thumb perk, and every time you visit your camp you're good to stock up. Doesn't matter if it spoils in your inventory because it typically grows back fast enough.
---
they've already showed off ALOT of new features and future content, alot more than any meat week quest. Meat Week didnt have new plasma weapons and a whole new weapon type, new enemies, new locations, NPCs, Companions, a Whole new main questline etc etc. you should really fact check before you make false statements
---
I find it more likely than your bullshit claiming you were banned for reporting a havker.
---
&gt;Energy Weapons dont even benefit from Demo Expert to begin with either.
---
dataminers have specifically proven that they do benefit from demo expert. where are you getting your information? You are full of bad information and you seem to like it that way. I encourage you to test out your ideas in-game before getting nasty in reddit comments.
---
&gt;Stop trying to spread disinformation, or, instead of shifting the burden of proof to me, why dont YOU show me your results? Hm?
---
heres my results, straight from the mouth of one of the Top dataminers.

Upvoting to make it seen. My Xbox buddy was less than 1000xp away when it seems to have just ended. We won a few more games hoping that it was just a visual error. Super bummed to inform him that he was actually cut off from getting it.

A video would be helpful. No one else seems to be experiencing this.

No dumbfuck, no.

This is a pretty large thread and it got that way pretty fast.  And there’s also a couple other pretty healthy threads on the same topic. 
---
How does Bethesda possibly defend not even at least coming in to respond? Nothing. Crickets.
---
Can someone please tell me the easiest way to cancel my 1st subscription?
---
More like farm more free ones that are twice as good as the paid ones but u do u.
---
And it’s ok for you to move along without commenting, yet here we are.
---
Login failed. This account is not authorized. - PS4
---
Sometimes, I get this error if I've left a game session and then sat idle in the Main Menu for too long. I'll attempt to log back in and that's what prompts. Usually, I just close the application and then log back in and it's fine. I've never duped items, but it's possible I've possessed a duped weapon possibly on more than one occasion. It's always a little alarming whenever I see that lol
---
I can't confirm this, but it wouldn't surprise me at all.
---
Bethesda tries to roll out several fixes, only manages to get two of them, and still fucks up something in the process.
---
It already works on half walls.
---
Geez most of us are civilized.
---
Watch the language and insults.
---
ten
---
Can people like you please stop blaming the players for Bethesda's issues? I get that some hate for the sake of hating but some are critical because the situation calls for it.
---
How about directing your ire towards Bethesda and encorage/badger them to do better, respond to their community and fix their shit?
---
Thats what I thought.  The op's comment threw me off.
---
This is very aggravating if you're trying to do something odd like building in a satellite dish.
---
I got it during Halloween week and havent had any issues, maybe it's a problem starting after today's "hotfix"?
---
So your saying your a superior loyal fan compared to the ppl still playing and enjoying this game? 
---
Might i be as bold to ask if we are inferior for enjoying a game you apparently dislike?
---
I was playing a round in NW, with 4 bloatflies attacking me at the very start of the round. I was having a serious case of the Bethesdas: I fired 4 rounds at the fat bastards with VATS at point blank, and all 4 shots missed. My only weapon, the Gauss Rifle, would no longer fire or reload. I couldn't run, despite having AP. Desperate, I ran into a Bunker and closed the door behind me.
---
Naturally, the bloatflies opened the door and followed me in. I almost died 30 seconds into the round due to a series of impossible events.
---
I was 100 away from my pumpkins skin and went for lunch. Smh oh what a mistake that was
---
Lol. Ok, sure, why not. 
---
All opinions and bugs other than those you experience are bullshit. Because God knows this is such a bug free game, with the best support anywhere. 
---
Nice post history btw.
---
I'd be happy if they just returned survival almost as it was, gave it adventure damage system, and modified stealthboys to work like in NW (turns off after shooting). People would play it again if damage wasn't ridiculously low.
---
that would be cool.
---
Not sure what you're talking about, I never said you deserve hate. I said Bethesda do.
---
You know they'll screw it up though. Best case scenario, you start from scratch and have to earn 14k XP again.
---
i am interested in people leaving and why .  Because the furture of this game depends on people keep playing it While some stories may have a bit much drama - this isnt one of them.

Wow this didn't age well
---
Lol. That's their new psychological warfare mode, where you fight against the greatest enemy ever.... Yourself.
---
RNG is a cruel mistress.
---
She sure is!
---
Bethesda just made a statement basically calling them liars lolol 
---
I would be ok with that.
---
Edit.  SB's 7 &amp; 8, both regular, dropped the plans for the Prime Receivers for the Combat Shotgun and Gatling Laser.
---
&gt; How do you recommend I prevent this in the future 
---
As with real life, don't engage at all. Block, ignore, report and move on.
---
&gt;and keep this from affecting how I feel about the game and it’s community. 
---
That one is entirely on you!
---
I find the secret to getting 3 star weapons is needing a 1 or 2 star weapon to finish up my daily scrip.

Real pros live in the Cranberry Bog!

Upvoting for visibility
---
Regarding of where you are that same message plays.
---
You have two minutes before the nuke drops so check the map, the targeted area shows up as a red ring.
---
I would, too, but I had it earned within 2-3 hours of gameplay.
---
I loved meeting opposing teams of well prepared individuals and I loved trying to beat them. Anything that lets me use my character to fight other people's prepared characters would make me happy.
---
NW but with my movement speed, jumping distance and weapons ordered the way I placed them would satisfy me too.
---
&gt;Most of the hate comes from people who quit long ago or never even played. 
---
Well, that's certainly reasonable speculation.
---
Maybe not so much. Someone posted recently of a game of 11 and they were on Xbox.
---
That's how I've been doing my legendary farming since patch 14 hit. My only problem is they like to die right over, or bounce right back into, the fissures, and it is a finicky business to try to loot a SB that's sitting at the bottom of one.
---
If the server isn't stable (which, I know, crazy talk) you can sometimes jump in, loot the body, then quickly jump back out and start running. You'll still die, but you'll die outside after taking a few steps, like the end of Kill Bill.
---
Haven't been able to successfully do it. Servers are too shit to let me and my friends complete objectives in the silo to get around to launching.
---
Any way you look at it RnG sucks. Hopefully your drops improve. May the 3☆ stuff come soon for you.
---
Think of selling your daily maximum robot vendor cap count as the base of the caps you make per day. Like others have said, go to Uranium Fever event, West Tek (not my fave bc no near by vendor), or Harpers Ferry (my fave bc a vendor is there). With West Tek &amp; Harpers Ferry once you clear it out you can sever hop to respawn all the enemies and repeat. You can easily hit your 1,400 daily cap limit. 
---
In my opinion player vending is for making caps via players past your daily 1,400 from robot vendors.
---
Literally one of the biggest content creators for FO76 just made a post about how he was banned for
---
Finding a glitch.
---
Getting video proof of said Glitch.
---
Reported it to Bethesda.
---
Banned.
---
We literally have proof of this in front of us, yet you still deny it?
---
Thank you for actually doing your job by responding to and managing your community.
---
Please more of this in future, even if this reads somewhat combative.
---
do you have a screen shot of the picture because i dont see this picture anywhere
---
Clearly.
---
Players also aren't banned for BLANTANT AND UNRESTRAINED CHEATING.
---
It's a bit hot down there, so i only bring my tent, lol
---
You sure it was an attack and not just getting hit in a cross-fire?  I've taken damage during some events like that where you have 15 people shooting off all kinds of weapons.  I've had that marker come up saying "Under Attack by So-n-So" but I'm not actually being directly attacked.
---
I literally stopped playing my favorite Adventure build because of PA bugs. The jetpack bug described in the OP makes the mod unusable.
---
Drink some Ballistic Bock (increases degradation) and see if your weapons still remain at 100%.
---
I believe you can exit/decline the event. Not sure how but this would explain it.
---
Alway run pacifist and make sure your team does as well.
---
Simple. You enter the Event, then delete it from your Pip-Boy, and when someone inevitably hits you with an explosive gun or a tesla or just being unlucky, you are able to hit them back.
---
You are saying pple who hate fo76 are the loyal base, what does that make the ppl who enjoy it?
---
Just bc you said beth f'd loyal fanbase does not mean all think that.
---
I think if bethesda wanted to do better they would put a community  team together  like warframe has...  Listen to people...  Put a stream team together  there are a bunch that stream this game and are losing hope and they know what people want and see the faults in game.  But bethesda just don't talk to us at All. I think that's where alot of the hate comes from as well
---
I play the game for hours(Around 1600hrs in I believe.) on end and I loved it but I also hated it. The bugs, the way Bethesda has repeatedly lied, the game is truly in a worse state then at launch if people want to see it or not is upto them but I have been playing since beta and although they added the scout missions and the cryptid missions it is indeed a mess. We have legendary effects that have no purpose now, we have scaling issues all over the map, I freeze if I want to use a repair kit from the queen, I freeze if I want to inspect armor or weapons, I freeze when I want to eat or drink, I freeze/crash every couple events and even worse on limited events. The list goes on and on. They need to shit or get off the pot before fans like me waste anymore money on a dead project/experiment and become even saltier. If they truly intend to stick with their original statement and support it for years to come then get the proper coders over and the proper support team and correct all these slights to their fan base and if they have decided it is no longer viable then release server hosting and let us host or pay for private servers at our discretion. But don't milk it for money for the next 6months until wastelanders is set to release and then dump it like it feels with the lack of effort lately. In the mean time I'll be hanging up my Fo76 fedora and moving on to all the games I've been meaning to play and just jumping on for atom challenges 
---
every once in awhile as I don't need to have a panic attack every time I sit down to play video games.
---
I think she is a raider
---
People blaming or criticizing others for being open and honest about the state of the game are far worse than those complaining about it. 
---
I enjoy playing FO76 but Bethesda is not above the law.
---
Last night I stashed two AA weapons, took them out again then dropped them in a paper bag (a bullet first for insurance), re-equipped them both. Went to Berkeley, got 4 out of 7, 3* weapons dropped as AA. RNG is a sick f*ck.
---
Haha! True!
---
Automatic weapon fire to the torso. If you try to bloodied melee Assaultrons you’re gonna have a bad time.
---
Most of the people start off their threads and posts with that statement.
---
The ol, Titanfall 1 method. Me like.
---
If they leave the event and you hit them without pacifist which sound like you’re team mate did the can PvP it’s pretty shitty thing to do
---
I moved north once the tent was put it, man living down there was a bitch. That tent is the best.
---
Man three 3*s in one Uranium Fever and three 1* drops. Really broke my heart. If I want 13 scrip Leader of the Pack costs a lot less in bullets.
---
Fun theory I heard on here so it may not be true but it makes sense. 
---
Don't read your prime plans and more will drop. You can sell the duplicates otherwise you will only get ones you haven't read yet.
---
If anyone has tested this let me know.
---
I don’t trust this. Considering you banned the Fo76 interactive map creator who is a reputable member of the community after he reported a major exploit that revealed players account information. There is no more benefit of the doubt shit, this is half assed damage control.
---
companies aren’t your friends and don’t need you to defend them, learn to live with people disliking things you like
---
Yea like this is all that's the matter, marine if they fixed there game and stopped ignoring people them rumors wouldn't be floating around
---
In order to be duped, they had to be in-game first.
---
People like to fk with lower levels. I started a new character this weekend and had several people start shooting me, hitting me. Like really. Im still in my 76 jumpsuit. Ive started several characters over the past year and have not had people not fk with me.
---
Lol.. are you a wizard? At a thousand xp per win, and a win lasting about 20 minutes in 2 to 3 hours of nothing but wins you would only have 6,000 to 9,000 xo and that’s not even considering loading screens and vault time.
---
 Nice try tho
---
Maths is hard
---
ah thanks, wasnt aware of that.
---
I like leader of the pack. It's easy I can use a revolver and I get sick of running the same events.
---
And yeah that sucks.
---
I noticed too.
---
Never, been playing since release week.
---
I must of missed this post. What happened???
---
The bottlecap mines started showing up in the game again after having been removed already, so that's probably one thing.
---
I can't change the title portion otherwise I would 😭
---
Except he didn't report the glitch, somebkdy elze did. He Just used third party software to manipulate the game a buncb of times and didn't report. Read his update on his website.
---
Ive launched more than 50, sometimes to farm Whitesprings or the Queen, other times with malicious intent to either destroy player camps or make players leave servers.
---
I only know what's what from dude's original thread. Sooo yeah I don't. If Bethesda is actively working with them to right the situation it hasn't been communicated clearly to people so people are either A. My case, which is reading the original thread and having the opinion above or B. Hating on Bethesda for wrongfully banning someone. Either way that's a problem don't ya think?
---
It's the bags that don't drop (not sure if they do in pvp + an event, but I'm sure you know). He init pvp somehow. Might have been electric discharge or he could have shot someone. So did you guys beat them or [https://imgur.com/4kLq0RQ](https://imgur.com/4kLq0RQ)
---
I see the shills are already doing their downvoting work. Sad.
---
420*
---
1. He was NOT one of the "biggest content creators".  Being a Youtube tryhard isn't the same thing
---
2. He *admitted* use of a cheat engine which is why he got banned
---
3. *After* the ban hammer came down he decided to punish the entire community for it by removing a semi-useful mapping site he made.
---
Those are the *actual* facts.  Now bring on the 7 downvotes form the sham accounts I know I'll be getting 🙄
---
I will confirm that these do work, though my experience was weird with em.
---
I had to stand right next to a fissure and then use photomode with me inside the picture of the fissure for that one to register.
---
The legendary I got lucky in cranberry bog area where a mongrel spawned and I lured it right next to the fissure before blowing its head off.
---
I actually got the forest camo jumpsuit last week from it, and the tomahawk plans. So maybe this week is just payback for that?
---
Stick to reading comments instead of standing behind someone's pants leg saying "yeah" is my advice to you. Cronie.
---
You also don't have to loot the security protocols from the sentry bot each time either
---
No longer home at the moment, but I'll try and get one before long! It was the last picture of a homemade laser rifle skin. The second picture was some sorta magician outfit
---
&gt;You are saying pple who hate fo76 are the loyal base, what does that make the ppl who enjoy it?

No, I said Bethesda fucked their fans. Didn't say anything about "loyalty."
---
Damn I'm jelly my event drops suck
---
rather the latter\^\^
---
i was on a PvE toon with non explosive heavy guns but a mate unloaded a whole mag of his be laser without moving the hp bar much\^\^
---
Fair. It was a more thoughtful post than most but it still boils down to "I am bored".  
---
Guess what, I'm a little bored too. I haven't played for a couple weeks, just been hopping on occasionally. Should I make a thread about that?
---
What's the point? Seriously.... Just hiding and doing nothing? Do you seriously enjoy that? 
---
Props to you if you do, but why not get a gun and at least shoot at someone when they run by you?
---
We legit probably ran past this guy 3-4 times.... Solo.... He could have killed is if he had a weapon.
---
&gt; He used a cheat engine to discover the exploit/bug.
---
Apparently he used it *hundreds* of times or more - if one reads between the lines of  the Bethesda OP post .
---
I don;t think he was doing "scientific research" all those hundreds of times.
---
Interesting, my last email from them said "I am escalating your ticket to a specialized team..." Those exact words, maybe there is some hope they will actually fix this..
---
Yeah I got everything else so I mean I still have most of the rewards, just was hopi g to get it that last day for the final push but I'll be alright. I probably wouldn't wear it much anyway , it's just the collector part of me was upset 😂
---
He was banned for using a cheat engine.
---
That Not what i was talking about. https://www.pinterest.com/pin/362047257529182527/

Back in the day I forgot to turn passive on...I was level 9 and accidentally hit some level 100 plus in PA with my twig of unimpressive non destruction a second before he swung his uber hammer of noob erasing devastation and one shot me

Thanks Bethesda !  👍
---
Just ban their ip address
---
The Combat armor paint was cooler anyway LOL you got that, hopefully you've got an awesome set to throw it on

Ah hell, that's gonna bother me now
---
2nd Edit.  AI is not happy with me, SB's 7-10 did not spawn in normal manner.  All appeared in the air above me w/o spawning in the Fissure.  
---
Also, SB #10 a 1\* Legendary rolled all the way down the hill into the Fissure so I could not loot it.  BTW, Graham showed up a second time after kill #7, coming down the hill to the south of the Fissure
---
Not trying to be a dick but your bored after a year of playing a game so your going to step away. Don't need to make a reddit post about it.
---
You don't know how the Internet works. Faking and masking IP addresses is pathetically easy.
---
One perk that makes shotguns somewhat more useful at range is Enforcer. While it does not affect the damage, the crippling effect ignores range, so enemies can be crippled from afar, then finished off once you close the distance.
---
When I write that I messed with something it just means I did some work on it/with it.
---
I messed with a few dishes using your cookbook.
---
I messed with the code you were building.
---
I messed with some of his books.
---
It doesn't necessarily mean changing anything. You just want it to be that way.
---
How does CE mess with server side data anyway?
---
&gt;How do you even change factions or make the purveyor take caps otherwise?
---
Like I told you before, its unclear. His post seems to imply the exploit was in-game. Again, CE can't mess with server side data. Weapons, caps, scrip, and all those things are stored in the server-side.
---
I started doing all the possum badges. That renewed my interest
---
Appreciate the lies?
---
Definitely rng on the stars. I've tried different luck and charisma, it's totally random. The prefix, I still believe luck plays a part in that. Boost luck when I see a legendary, it's been good.
---
Never had until this past summer. Now I do it for fun.
---
Yeah i guess i dont know much about that shit, had to think for a second about what an IP address was even called. Fucking press charges they are literally detrimental to the health of their product
---
Right? Itd be too sick.
---
It'll cost you!
---
Anything worth a good amount I try to sell on reddit. Vending is for all the average plans and legendaries . I like it when a newer player goes on a plan buying spree.
---
I'm with you 101%!
---
But it's outrage culture and it's endemic on the internet as we both know.  Certain personality types will *always* try to get attention by trying maximum outrage about something.
---
FYI the /r/fo76FilthyCasuals/ subreddit is filled with people who just share their love of the game and have a bunch of goofy fun with it.  The mods there keep the faux-outrage off the sub.  Check it out.
---
Its finicky and a bit laggy. You have to do it quick. I've found that spamming the key pads cause issues. I get the best result if you active the left one then run around the back of the building to the right one...making sure to hit active only once per pad.
---
It's open but empty mate, if you haven't played New Vegas I would highly recommend, or FO3. Hopefully the DLC wastlanders is coming at the start of 2020. Maybe wait untill then
---
[Nobody Believed That]
---
Oh ok didn't realize that. If you want any of the other ones available just lmk and I'm sure I got one you can get from me for a few caps.(I would give away but have learned most of them myself I have a hoarding problem and you never know what will be broken next...chi-ching LOL
---
I can't understand why they don't release skins more frequently for popular weapons and instead just seem to focus on weak or niche weapons. Seriously... Pickaxes? Batons? what's next, skins for Shovels and Syringer?
---
Come on Bethesda, surely it takes less time and resources to make even a basic skin for a popular weapon than making yet another C.A.M.P. bundle.
---
get a food mutation, and eat raw meat of raw plants. or be a good boy and eat canned dog food
---
And they ain't rumors they are truth

I lured him into the city proper and hid in a tank. Do what you can to survive. 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
same for me today, got me around 900 xp
---
Dude's just trying to find some bits to roll a smoke!
---
&gt; PA skins (that aren't just a paint)
---
There were a lot like that that have been released. I four horseman armors and some others that I dont care to look up the names of right now.
---
If you wanted to do that for each player that leaves this dumpster fire, you would have to hire a bunch of guys to help you.
---
I suspect some people, even people who enjoy NW but aren't top tier, are taking a little break after grinding for the Halloween shit. I know that's where I'm at, I haven't played in several days.
---
Oh, like what you're doing? Adorable.
---
They can’t just swipe shit off Google images. Some time, thought, and crafting actually goes into pretty pixels.

Patch notes: all jetpacks have been removed to do an expolit that allowed jetpacks to be attached to arms and legs. Play in your own private world for only $12 a month of $100 a year with a new Fallout 1st membership!
---
The only thing that it changes is your "Cone-of-Fire". It's 15% smaller with [rank 1](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/0032234F), 30% smaller with [rank 2](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/00322350), and 45% smaller with [rank 3](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/00322351)
---
the issue is that an online game needs players . People who wants a future of this game should care if many players leave the game for whatever reason.   Also  . bethesda has several time in public said that they read reddit - so it may also act as information for them - player retention should be a priority. 
---
Unless you only play solo - the game is also more fun with more people playing .  I trade a lot and can clearly feel the impact of fewer players on the market.
---
You are literally arguing your opinion of something that happened to you is clearly the only explanation and not somehing else. 
---
You literally looked through my post history in response to me positing an alternate explanation to your own bullshit theory? Dude, wow.
---
Mh, guess I should stay away from it then..
---
Sadly non of the older FOs are out on ps4 right now :(
---
My old 360 had to step aside some time ago, sooo..
---
maybe some recommendations for other games I could play in the meantime? I was looking into the new Metro game maybe?
---
Idk, just want some chill story game to play in the wintertime.
---
And they broke NW while they were at it.
---
It just works.
---
You are absolutely correct.
---
When the last major, large-scale, reliable dupe method was available, you could buy God-tier items for 25k or less, which was the per-character cap limit at the time. Once Bethesda patched the major dupe methods, the prices started to climb to 75k, 100k, 150k, and then sellers stopped taking caps as payment altogether. Real-life cash payments became the norm, locking many players out of the market entirely.
---
You only need to become a Tadpole to make the Standard 60 lb capacity backpacks, If you collect possum badges you can buy plans for different backpack mods, though. Some are pretty nice, like the refrigerated backpack and the High Capacity backpack.
---
As for your problem, maybe you didn't have the materials needed to make a 40lb capacity small backpack??
---
Have you visited the site recently he has more info up. - https://map76.com/ They 100% was testing exploits on the purveyor and running cheat engine. They were not banned for reporting a glitch/exploit. "Someone from my group stated that they already reported it to one of the community managers in our group, so I just left it." In the end they didn't even report the issue.
---
I've seen a handful. I believe I've seen far more ire from people like me who love the game but are angry with Bethesda right now for not giving a shit about fixing the glaring, frustrating problems with it.
---
You're not being a dick at all.  That's a fair point.  The reason for the post really isn't for you.  If Bethesda isn't able to get a pulse of what's going on it its community, how can it react to the trends of its users, especially one of decline.  This isn't me being mad about 1st.  This is me telling them I would love to keep playing, but they need to release more content to those of us who aren't 1st members, if they care.  And maybe there are no Bethesda devs that will ever read this.  So not to be a dick, this post isn't really for you.
---
It can happen. Happened to me once years ago in Lord of the Rings Online. Reported a hacker, minutes later get kicked from server with message I was banned. Was able to log back in 10 minutes and sent a ticket to customer service. They apologized and said they system mixed up the account of the reporter (me) with the hacker.
---
I'm level 86 and I've never done it. I only recently made it to the I Am Become Death quest. I play by myself, so I don't feel totally prepared yet. Maybe someday :) Meanwhile, I do Scorched Earth whenever it pops up.
---
I've only just switched to my first PA build, would've been nice to have decent skins to buy at any time.
---
It’s profitable to hate 76. The dozens of YouTube videos made by people who don’t even play every Tuesday has made that pretty obvious I feel like...
---
I was going for that glowing skeleton costume in NW until I got sick of the cheaters. Frustrating and liberating at the same time as it broke me of my in-game collecting habit. Now I don't care what I miss; both in-game and in the atom shop. It's some solace to know that the cheaters actually DID affect Bethesda's wallet and not just frustrate me.
---
 I’ve launched with a group of friends once. And I tried once on my own very tedious gave up after about almost an hour. That makes for a grand total of two for a level 170.
---
Agree because then you know they are all being used instantly. Because there are different markets it seems like there is the recommended vendor price then a reddit users price lol. Keep doing you and selling at normal reasonable prices like a non crazy person. 300 caps for a buffout lol
---
Thanks, it’s good to see I’m not insane in thinking they’ve completely over reacted here
---
Pick...Up...EVERYTHING! Scrap your junk weapons and armor you don't need at a work bench every chance you get.
---
Your of the opinion that beth fd over loyal fans and stated it as a fact.
---
I consider myself a loyal fan and do not share your opinion.
---
Was questioning your idea of what a loyal fan is bc i think many ppl have dif ideas.
---
Should have clarified better on prev posts.
---
I’m on ps4 too. I’m 17 and I don’t really like playing with anyone younger. Add PsychicMoo if you wanna play tho
---
I did and the game crashed as it landed. Never again.
---
Thought thats how you play Battle Royale... You either suck or you cheat and are OP.
---
Does the green thumb bundle have the green house?!
---
Occam's razor.
---
Told you hatemonger blinded morons that, but nooooo...  Pathetic creatures!
---
ok but compare the sizes between the 2.
---
That. Which is cunt-fucked, as it’s now 180
---
Did you put the custom ini in /my games/fallout 76, or did you put it in the actual game folder?
---
This was my test of the idea, next stop Prime Fissure, although I am worried about getting nuked there since I have so much crap I cannot fast travel.  Haven't since about Lvl 40 and I'm 156 now.
---
Lol. And you were doing the same thing with your opinion. 
---
Yes, I had to make sure so I don't waste my time arguing with you.
---
2 minutes saved me a few posts where you just keep doing what you do.
---
Yeah true that.
---
If you want the fallout vibe and feel in a new setting then this isnt a bad idea.
---
If you want to be the protaganist in a fallout story that make choices that matter, this is not it.
---
More or less your playing detective in this game, piecing together clues to fig what happened in the past.
---
What exactly in the OP is a lie?
---
Lol but the event is over. So why keep doing it?
---
I’m 26, where you from bro?
---
Hahaha. Thanks. That was pretty funny.
---
Does this rank a Noob to the status level of Lode Runner? Hmmmmmmm?
---
play it
---
Yet you still continue posting? God, arent you edgy?
---
Level 153 here, never done it.
---
Yeah sadly if your looking for story, fallout 76 hasn't even got a proper one. hardly any quests at all for a fallout game.
---
What, play Nuclear Winter? Cuz it's fun. I like it a lot and I'll start back up at some point. Enjoying Outer Worlds RN. It's not the best BR but it's pretty solid and you unlock stuff you can use in Adventure.
---
All I care about is, I hope buildable robots like the automatron dlc via fallout 4 becomes available. 
---
I'll buy that for a dollar
---
i have no clue.. I havent looked at any scout stuff since the moment I earned the standard backpack.. lol
---
Yes:  https://imgur.com/a/GC6qRD4

Pretty unfortunate for the guys with &lt;1000 XP left. They said November 12. When no where in the USA is it November 12 and it ends that's pretty strange. I 100% would've expected sometime 7:00am-7:00pm Nov 12 EST not Nov 11th. Or maybe when dailies reset which is Definitely after midnight EST .
---
Same here on xbox. I bought it a few hours before the event ended and it has never worked for me. I was able to select it as both my loot bag and death bag when I first purchased it, but it still drops a paper bag. There is no option to reselect it in the store, I can only "Inspect" it.
---
&gt;As soon as you can get two ranks in the starched genes perk card start shopping at player vending machines for the mutation serums you need based on your build.
---
You don't need to wait. I got the mutations I wanted at level 5. 
---
The only thing you have to do to is remember to not take any Radaway or go through decon arches. Rads can be managed with Brahmin Milk (from milking brahmins, of course) and Nuka-Grape which is available at the soda fountain in Whitespring. 
---
Let me tell ya, having Marsupial at level 5 makes the game a LOT more interesting at low levels.
---
Its embarrassing that this subreddit has to be told this...
---
The sub is littered with morons that have a shitty mob mentality and are gullible and desperate enough to convince themselves that Bethesda don't ban only cheaters.
---
They're making the game deliberately annoying to play (stash limit) so they can sell you the solution (scrap box).
---
It's fine you don't think you're being fucked, but you are.
---
I just hit level 305, I have never personally launched a nuke, but I was with someone once when they did.
---
Plus the stagger with that too. And I believe it’s still per pellet that hits so it triggers often
---
Bethesda, its so hard to believe you with all of the shady tactics you guys have been pulling here recently.
---
I don’t even know how to
---
When people like you refer to literally anyone with a halfway-positive comment about Fallout/Bethesda as being a shill, you’re going to get called an asshat.
---
I am an idiot... i didn’t have enough leather. Thank you all for the replies. I’ll try and do better next time, haha
---
When you prime your weapons so you can melt sbq. You'll need to launch nukes to farm flux and the mats to make it stable. Its end game grinding. I wanna see nuke bosses at the penitentiary and the mall. That would be coo.
---
Still not fixed after a today's "hotfix"
---
I'd say play it if you like looting, exploring, and combat. If story is your main interest, there isn't a lot to get into here. I've played this almost exclusively since December and have really gotten into trading which surprised me.
---
I learned this lesson from Monster Hunter world, lol
---
Generic neutral names henceforth!
---
I'm looking for the Prime .50 cal,  Handmade and Gatling Plasma Receivers.  Before this afternoon also had Primes for Lever Gun, Western Revolver, 10MM Auto.  The Prime LMG was my first.
---
Big F
---
What you mean you collect food? I just eat people lmao 😂😂😂 People are made out of food!
---
Gilipollas
---
Looks like just northwest of Arkos Pharma has a pretty consistent mix of all types of flux -- would be a good spot to stock up across the board.
---
In my opinion almost all the outfit and skins look like dirty or torn crap. We can get a nuke to launch but we cant sew cloth together?
---
"if you don't want to get banned"
---
Exactly this, theres a reason for some of the hate in the first place
---
It plays very similarly to fo4 so it shouldn't take you long to figure out if you like 76 or not.  Story mode for people who need to be force fed a story is coming soon.  Until then you just have to be curious and read a little.  The story is there and I personally like it.  You played 4, you know Bethesda games can sometimes be glitchy.  It's no worse than that.  I'm on ps4 and I crash once a week if that. 
---
Lots and lots of salty haters on this sub so take what you read here with a grain of salt.  You can pick up a used copy of fo76 on the cheap at any gamestop.  Formulate an opinion on it for yourself.
---
You can eat people in this game?
---
Is the PA paint still available?
---
I honestly leveled up my alts during the Double XP weekends, Levels 20-40\~ is a bit of a pain in the ass, even with twink gear and aid from my high level characters lol. I took a lot of Workshops and just did the Retake Events. You can also hammer through the main quest line for some decent XP and do any other events that pop up (Uranium Fever is decent for getting some gear). When you get up toward 50 you should be able to handle Harpers Ferry and Big Bend Tunnel and things like that to scrap or sell to vendors for the day etc.
---
Shit game, shit support workers.
---
People like me? Who would that be? Come on, say it, shill.
---
It doesn’t matter what you name it, all we’ll see is your GT
---
Can confirm the 10 kilos with the Flamer works, just completed the challenge.
---
There is no way to change a character name.  Not useless they added it in a patch I missed,  though I do not believe so.   However, at least on PC, people only see your gamer tag,  not your character name.  I still get that it can be bothersome though.
---
Molepeople, scorched people, mutand people, ghul people, there so many snack out there, just get levels in endurance and get the cannibalism perk! Oh and players,  you can finish off downed player by munching on them 😂!
---
You can criticize constructively without being inflammatory.
---
Dang you sucked up all the luck last week
---
A hardware ban is much more difficult to mask.
---
I really hope so..
---
Ok, asshat, try and keep up...
---
As I said in my brief and easy-to-follow comment, “people like you,” are the group who call anyone with a halfway positive view of the game/company/etc a shill.
---
Retake is the best imho, Defend events show up on the map so some assholes will pop in just to kill you, but the Retakes do not.
---
I solo launched a nuke. It took so long I’ve never launched a second. (felt good tho)
---
Don't shoot back
---
Mhh.. just saw its up on amazon für 12 Bucks.
---
I'll just give it a go.
---
And funny you bring up gamestop. In germany they mostly charge 90% of the initial release prices for all the games, no matter how old or cheap they are by now, sooo.. nope.
---
But thanks for the quick answer buddy ;)
---
No, hide in bushes for event hear after the event is over.
---
Yep, Sam here. I enjoy NW. It's my endgame lol.
---
Millennial
---
They have a 0.01% chance to spawn as a red one.  That's a 1 in 10,000 chance. So yeah, it's easily worth 100k or more.
---
My man knows what's up 😎👉👉
---
I launched a nuke during the first week and havent since
---
Never have.  Not with as janky as the servers are and the trouble everyone reports (spending an hour setting everything up and server crash).
---
Run solo though so I supposed it's not really feasible unless you have a group.
---
I was correcting you. I’m a millennial.
---
A friend of mine on PC has the same issue.
---
Me
---
I'm in the same boat as you. I have really stepped away the last two weeks. Played some Modern Warefare and focused on getting more time in the gym. Definitely anticipate i'll be back playing regularly in a few weeks and am looking forward to Wastelanders.  
---
I'm still just salty from all the negativity over the last month. I'm on this sub-reddit a lot at work so I have a pretty short fuse with negative or "im leaving" posts as they are very frequent and often times from people who don't even play the game. Hopefully there is some quality content in the works and you can be re-engaged later. Nothing hits quite like fallout.
---
Me as an Xbox gamer 😏
---
That's my man, feeling young means being young!
---
 To go to pure rifle would be easy. Its not far from where I am. I just love my Combat Knives a lot. They are so much fun.
---
 My point was that you can do a good hybrid, not a perfect one.
---
What is that middle item below the Plans? Is that a chocolate bar or something? I dont understaaaaaaand
---
**Good**: Appalachia (landscapes, ambience, music, scope, diversity, etc.)
---
**Bad**: Quality control, endgame design, monetization, social systems
---
**Ugly**: Most atom shop cosmetics
---
lol someone was indoctrinated with controversy propaganda weren't they
---
I made new characters to try different playstyles.  But I understand your sentiments.
---
People defend ESO?  Wait people actually play that game?  I remember after skyrim, and ESO came out, I watched one gameplay video and was like, nope.
---
Level 98 and launched 18
---
Nice
---
Yeah let's retcon the fuck out of this meme of a game!
---
Outterworlds is pretty good, hyped for wastelanders too
---
That is fair. I was definitely a bit rude about it with my response.
---
You're right, I was thinking of the combat armor paint @ 7000XP. That one took 2-3 hours of gameplay.
---
Now we're getting somewhere. Got anything else to refute anything else I've said at that point? Cause I'll gleefully admit to being wrong on the Demolition Expert front, but youve shown nothing to prove the whole core of our argument. 
---
Here. I made two videos for you. They are the same build. The same AAE Laser. The only difference is Focus/Split and a normal SB and a Legendary.
---
The first one is the AAE w/ Beam Focuser vs a Level 65 Scorchbeast. 
---
https://youtu.be/JPGUKk6H1DU
---
The second is the same AAE w/ Beam Splitter vs a Legendary one. 
---
https://youtu.be/oSCQjuMkKbQ
---
Please tell me that you can see a drastic difference in the amount of damage that is being dealt here. Focuser isnt bad, but it is not in any way better than Splitter unless youre worried about durability. 
---
I do test my ingame ideas. And if we're being frank, you were wrong about the Demo Expert thing until he corrected you as well. Im here to learn, and ill admit when im wrong provided you can prove it. So prove it again.
---
I can see the appeal of something like Fallout with EVE mechanics, but the game is no where near large enough (mostly player count per instance, but probably also map size) for that to work.
---
Aye same! Kinda wanting to try out the shower then backpack mods, but it's a struggle!
---
I have imgurs if that server. I’ll send it to BGS.
---
The new wallpapers look ugly AF.
---
I hate Destiny because I bought D1, the first week, and it was like 4 missions that you replay over and over, with no story line or cut scenes.  Got bored as hell after a week.  Best thing the game ever had was the loot cave, that was gone after a couple of days.  Then it took them a year to update everything, and make it better, but by that time, I wasn't going back to that game, and there was no way in hell they were getting another dollar from me.  Got D2 for a free psn game, played the first mission, haven't gone back to it, not sure if I will.
---
Fuck.  Yes.  They brought the plague doctor mask back.
---
Oh you best believe when I found my first full Giddyup Buttercup post Display update I sprinted back to my CAMP only to be royally disappointed I couldn't display it. 
---
Anyway, question...where do I find a chainsaw? I have never come across one and I have the flame mod for it and could have really used it for Halloween season. Maybe next season...
---
They said they did yes.
---
Actually you can cause i've changed mine few months ago. I don't remember exact process but i know that you do that on bethesda's web page, something in account settings. Only thing i know for sure is that you can change your name every three months.
---
Well yes, but actually YES! THAT'S technical the truth!
---
I've read all the unpopular ones so I just get the better ones like handmade and 50 cal dropping.
---
Get down to the floor, everybody do the dinosaur!
---
&gt; unlimited junk storage
---
This is why I quit the game, I would spend more time managing inventory items, than actually playing the game.
---
 **Archaeologist**  **Atomics Fan**  **Backpacker**  **Leatherworker**  **Metalworker**  **Musician**   **Photographer** 
---
 **Rail Enthusiast**  **Roboticist** 
---
These are the possum badges I completed - needed 8 to get hi cap backpack mod. Leatherworker took the longest
---
cause finding deathclaw hides was not as easy as I thought it would be. Never got any badges from dailys etc.
---
Agreed!
---
Dont know.   I did try a vault 94 mission solo on easy recently and ran out of Radaway.  It was my first run and I didn't know what to do so I spent a lot of time finding my way around.  I died several times and never lost anything, other than my pride....
---
I also didn't have a rad suit with me so when fixing the mainframe I used Radshield.  It barely gave me the time to craft what I needed outside of PA.  I've since picked one up. 
---
Working on an Exterminator armour set and weapons for the next run.  I already have a one shot explosive Exterminators handmade, so I'm part way there.
---
Lol, most of mine I've purchased from players. But I will say I've never received a duplicate from an SB. Hopefully that theory is correct.
---
Used to launch like 5 a day with my friends, we nuked the exavt same spot a couple of times, so the circle would just turn a darker shade of red. Some noticed the second launch some others however....
---
If these bans are auto detected which they most likely are, then Bethesda doesn't really have much info to go on other than how often you used these cheats which in the OP was stated as "several hundred times"
---
he's being fucked as we speak, let him be
---
For real they give all the boys guys hella shit with emblems ND enclave gets shit
---
🤣🤣🤣 You'll move some product that way!
---
Iirc the supreme court had ruled it legal to hack games unless they were doing something like giving themselves atoms, or if the hacker is distributing the hacks to others and the hacks include code that isnt theres. If for example they had to use code in the hack program that includes code from fallout 76, and then they sell the hack to others, they would be in legal trouble. 
---
If the program is totally written by the hacker than it only violates the terms of service and doesnt break laws unless it's a gambling game, p2w game, or they use it to gain some bullshit tokens like atoms
---
Wow, their stock is pretty barebones for an organized duping ring. There are individual legitimate traders on the Market subreddit that blow that stock out of the water. Interesting read, thanks for sharing
---
16 and deleted the game a month after launch
---
Haha. Nice.
---
Map76 guy here. I assume this is in regards to me. That blew up fast, I am even having Forbes and other outlets trying to interview me over this debacle. None of which was my intention. Also I keep seeing things said of what I have said by people, which I never said. Which, I know how that works, and it is fine, but I have the details on [map76.com](https://map76.com) of what I actually said, so go there if you are curious.   
---
I never said that they are banning people who report exploits, nor do I support that statement. Some people, including Bethesda here, seem to be missing the point of this entire thing. Did I do an exploit? Eventually. The details are on my site of the process I went through to try to discover an exploit. People do not just tell you about these things. There are rumors and pieces of evidence pop up, and I tried to figure out what they were doing, because the trade market, which I am/was very active in, was starting to be affected. I wanted this to stop. 
---
&gt; take advantage of an exploit usually in excess of hundreds of times 
---
It took me about 8+ solid hours of modifying the game and testing to pinpoint how it worked. I started with a shotgun approach that modified hundreds of things in order to get it to work the first time. It took more than hundreds of times to narrow it down. I didn't keep track, but it took me an entire day. When I was confident in how the exploit worked, I went to bed from exhaustion. I woke up to find that someone had posted an exploit using the purveyor online. I ran a few checks with that to see if it worked the same way, which also took time. I am working with reading the raw bytes memory here manually on a game that uses over 3GB of ram to determine this.  It takes time and is difficult. By the time I determined it used basically the same method I discovered the night before, I came to find out that it had already been reported by someone else in our group. Should I have also reported it? I mean, in hind sight, sure, just so I have a record that I did, but I figured it wouldn't be necessary, and I could just explain it is me if it comes up. someone already reported it, and my work was done.
---
Well, it came up. I got a 72 hr ban. Oh well, no big deal. No reason to be upset. Before the 72 hrs was up, I received another message that my account has been deactivated pending further investigation. Which is a perma ban just so you know. There never seems to be any investigations and the accounts are never given back, from what I hear. So I wrote them a message explaining my role in this and informing them of what I was doing, why, the details of the report, and that people from the group I am in are the ones who reported it. 
---
No response. 
---
After many days, I then followed up letting them know I took the map down, as I cannot further develop it if I cannot use these third party tools they hate so much. No response. The original ban was almost a month ago.   
---
I literally just now had an email notice pop up, and they just permanently deactivate my account. Literally just now. 
---
So my advice, if you find an exploit. Like if a little box pops up in front of you and says "press x to exploit" by all means, don't press x and report that. If you do something and think, oh wow, people could exploit that. I would advise you not to report it, you just did it, and as I discovered, your intention doesn't matter in the slightest of why you did it, you are an exploiter, but feel free to take your chances. However, and here is where I went wrong, if there is a big enormous game destroying exploit that you are really concerned about as a faithful player and decide to use your technical expertise to track down so you can report it, since it apparently has been going on for months and Beth has absolutely no idea what is happening, for the love of god, do not under any circumstances try to figure out what they are doing so you can report that exploit. Because you will probably be banned and no matter what you do or say or try to explain nor your intention, people will call you a cheater, they will ban you, and in my case, it will all have been for nothing because that exploit is still there being exploited a month later, it is still not fixed. 
---
And this is my entire problem I have. Beth, does not care if you create community tools. They do not care how much you help other players, find and report bugs, and genuinely spend hours of every day trying to make this game better. They will treat you the same as someone duping 1,000 items, hacking NW, ruing the game for everyone, and doing real money trading. The only difference is, in my case I got a permanent ban for the first offense and no response from customer support. The NW cheaters got 72 hour bans for ruining and still continue to ruin the game. I took down my site, because they don't want my community tools, which they are free to want. I am mad because they ignored me. I am disappointed because I thought they appreciated my work and the countless hours I have dedicated to the community. I was wrong. That is fine, but other people who love this game as much as I do need to be aware that Bethesda might not find your contribution to their game nearly as important as the community does. 
---
That is all, thank you Beth for finally giving me a response, after posting this, and weeks later. Thank you everyone in the community who has supported me through all of this. I hope wastelanders lives up to the hype and I hope Bethesda realizes how much they need the community and their help. But, they do not want me to be a part of it, so I wont be. It is what it is.
---
I'm 80 and I will never launch a nuke.  To launch a nuclear device after the world has been destroyed is ridiculous.  I thought this was already settled in Lonesome Road in Fallout NV.
---
Just some plain paint colors would be nice. 
---
And I second the interior brick/stone.
---
Also the ability to add paper to the outside of the wall to make interior walls would be nice. 
---
It would be nice if the plain colors was an in game item and you just went somewhere that had a paint mixer and could make your own gallons of paint to really tweak your shades.

I launched one at level 88 solo. Pissed me off because I had been all the way there at level 80 and had the old code. It had been changed that day. Once you use your card from the cargo bot, thats it. Unless you go in there with more than one, its your only shot. The whole thing resets and you start all over.
---
I like this idea, particularly the notion of being able to apply a variety of condition overlays on top.

I also suggest a set of solid color porcelain faced metal panels, similar to what you see in Robco and West Tek, in a variety of 1950's atomic age colors.

I have never had a higher star rating drop and my luck is high.
---
My wife will get good drops from the same legendary with Lowe luck.
---
Yes.
---
I did it at like level 90 and didn't even really know what I was doing.  I was just exploring a base that ended up being one of the nuke bases, and it asked me for the code.  Apparently you can look them up (they change every week but they keep it updated) and I entered it and the nuke went off.
---
Still don't see it in that tab...
---
Forgot to mention I play the raids 2-3 times a week. Just remember to bring radaway and stims. I use a Bloodied Powerfist and an Exterminators Death Tambo and am able to get through it fine, but I also run with a team that preps for the raid. I req doing it on Novice a few times to see what they are like, and then going up from there.

Have to wait for the deicing spray to evaporate in warmer temperatures. Until then, main roads are all closed, and the only thing to do in my part of town is tour hospitals so you can catch all the latest and greatest communicable diseases.

What about not being able to cancel fallout 1st hm?

Near v76. The little shack nearby. There is a garden.  North of the entrance to the right.

No, this just show how much faith people have lost in Bethesda since everything with Fallout 7y6 started. If you asked me a year and a half ago I'd never think Bethesda would do half the stuff they've done. Now.....
---
It’s not difficult solo.
---
Me and my friends have been doing the raids for about a month now. Novice, standard and expert. Not once have we had anything happen to our inventories.
---
Note: they did eventually open the roads back up with the caveat that they're going to spray them again and to expect more closures after dark. 
---
112 degrees? Handled. Not a problem. 
---
32? I don't know, spray something on the road and slap a closed sign on it.
---
The game is decent for a linear RPG, dialogue is fine, NPCs speaking the dialogue are not great.
---
You cant rename the char itself, but you can change the display name at bethesda,net if you are PC. Dont know how it works for ps4 or xbox tho
---
I am level 165 and have not yet launched a nuke either / finished the main quest line.. No idea why...
---
I am lvl 175 and attempted once solo but broke all my weapons and ran out of stimpacks right toward the end when you have to protect the robots while the prepare for the launch. So I got roughed up and died at that point. Ever since I haven’t had the energy to do it again by myself
---
I haven't either! I'm level 181 and haven't even been to fissure prime yet. I actually just finished the Brotherhood's quest line at the Glassed Caverns last month, and haven't done it yet, partly due to the 2nd coming on MEAT WEEK and Mischief Nighttttttttt. 
---
I've also never done the Scorched Queen event either! I refuse to do it until I can launch my very own nuke. I mostly get on a do the challenges each day for those atoms, and don't try to really do the whole nuke process. I also refuse to use the online nuke decoder, cause that's just not all that fun for me I think haha. 
---
I see the Queen as an end game thing, and I partly wanna explore the last locations I have yet to see in game as well. 
---
ALSO, my Acer Predator Helios 300 laptop the last few months has had trouble running Fallout 76; I assume it's a patch or some engine change that my components do not like. It makes the game a real drudgery to play most times, and I quit earlier each time. But, I still enjoy it enough though! So that's my story! 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
---
I “launched” one around level 60 (I’m level 115 now) but it was with the help of 3 other players and my WiFi was repeatedly crashing, so I don’t really count that 1 time.
---
Only 1 of my characters can use it oddly enough
---
Same and completed the **Miner** badge as well. Because I was able to tick some objectives off while grinding the others.
---
I used to sell as much steel for 1c each as I had in about 2h on my vending machine, now it takes a day or more to move less than a half of it...

Yeah.... I was surprised too
---
not entirely true...  
---
We have been asked to report them, and if we can find the details of the exploits and bugs, to report the specific steps required to replicate it so they can close the holes faster.  
---
Often this means experimentation and figuring out the details....
---
I haven't. My main is level 190, secondary is about level 250, and the three others are slightly past level 100.
---
completely flawed approach, the NW cheaters are using them non-stop and getting warnings or 3 day suspensions...  
---
The others involved in data mining are getting perma-bans
---
They did ban them, and they are loyal players, but it doesn't mean they didn't do it
---
Good to know, I was thinking of not reading the plans on my alts so I could get extras to sell.
---
Hi Shaun.
---
rephrased that last part since it didn’t make sense
---
I think it really depends on the server. I’ll have some nights when I’m only getting 1* drops and then I’ll switch servers a couple times and next thing you know I’m getting 2*-3* drops regularly (still really bad rolls, but scrip is scrip)
---
Lol that list is so outdated. We truly have every gun in the game at our disposal now
---
Thanks for explaining so I didn't look dumb haha
---
I'm upvoting you just because you used fortnightly instead of bi-weekly. 
---
Top notch old chap 😉

Lies and more lies. I know for a fact one individual was banned who was reporting issues.

So this breaks your code of silence? Nothing else? Wonderful. You do this after the holloween challenges that ended a day early. You sound pissed off in this rant of yours Bethesda. I've been slowly unplaying your game lately

You're not real clear on how *finding* exploits works, huh?
---
Hell yeah internet high five 🖑
---
It’s nice to see BGS breaking the silence in this sub. I think most of us who are reasonable wanted this point addressed publicly, among a few others. I think the exploiting was a major one, and thank you for following through on that topic.
---
however, many of us also have a lot of concerns about Fallout first and wastelanders, as well as NW Halloween rewards disappearing early and the Halloween event having such poor stability. 
---
Please make a statement on these topics and I think you’ll have the community back on your side for the most part. We’re just hoping our concerns are taken into consideration and some information starts flowing again.
---
Lvl 156 and I haven't.  went in a silo once in the 90's and it just seemed like a massive waste of ammo and meds although if I had a step by step guide I might try again.  Got as far as creating a Biometric ID and gave up.
---
Oui
---
Please link where they ask you to keep exploiting it and to “find” the details. “If you can” meaning you know how already and not continuing to exploit it. They are very specific to not continue using the exploit.

I too can not stress how much I appreciate this post, I had a tough day at work so a bit of belly giggles was in order. Its like watching a child dress up as a police officer and comically reprimand their dog for eating the last cookie. Oh, you do you Beth, you do you.
---
No, you can't atm.
---
I made a female char in Fallout 4 to role play some, different dialogue etc, but I don't really see the point in this game. In Fallout 2 you could fuck T Ray for your car back and things like that, but not in 76. Playing a female you're just a chick with a dudes voice lol
---
I mean, how is that different from any other persistent game where someone can be a dickwad to you in?
---
Nothing is wrong with playing a sniper. There’s something wrong with not having to worry about camouflage because you’re always invisible and have a built in aimbot that 1 shots someone. 
---
If you can’t even comprehend why that’s a fucking garbage mechanic in literally any game ever conceived, then it’s pointless to argue with you.
---
Does it count if I tried? When my first character hit 55 I solo'd the silo entered the code and then just as I was about to hit the launch button my character glitched and froze mid animation. At that point I had used all my ammo, broken every bit of armor and almost every weapon I had as well as used up all the scrap on the character so I just started a new character and never bothered to do the silos again.
---
No, just don't do it. 76 has a beautiful world, but it's a hollow shitshow right now in terms of gameplay. I'm embarrassed to say I've logged over 2000 hours of FO4, and I still prefer it to 76.

I should have worded it differently. That's what happens, not what would happen. The younger kids have raw talent, but they are reactive. They act without forethought. The top adult players also have talent, but they're proactive. They're 2-3 steps ahead.

---
I guess I’m confused by your logic here. Should you get a pass because you create community tools? I understand that you put a lot of time and effort into them, and that is admirable. But that’s not a pass to do whatever/“get out of jail free” card. 
---
I think when Bethesda asks for exploits to be reported, they aren’t expecting for you to work the system for 48 hours with a Cheat Engine trying to figure out things that the average joe isn’t going to know how to do. And if you’re silly enough to go THAT length, you should definitely be taking footage and reporting it immediately so your backside is covered. Why did you think “I’m a content creator, so I’m safe” was even a thing? That doesn’t make you part of the Beth team. Right now, they just see you as an exploiter and a pot stirrer.
---
People **should** report bugs and exploits. (Immediately if they trigger them, as I’m sure you’ve learned.) But they should not be out there methodically testing them. Pass the info along and let Bethesda do that. Its not your job; at the end of the day, you’re just a player like the rest of us.
---
Sure, you win the point about the splitter vs the focuser on SB. I dont believe you'll see better damage like that vs the SBQ, thats probably what I was thinking of

so definitely a glitch just logged in everything is stacked and i just put armor on we'll see how long that lasts

The problem is we have concrete examples of known NW hackers getting "Warnings" or 3 day suspensions, when we've submitted multiple video's of them flying, clipping through walls, etc...
---
If you can, you can. I'm saying that if the two groups of top-notch players I know, young vs old, there are two styles:
---
Young players have raw talent and can do very well, but they are less consistent.
---
Adult players have more refined talent, do very well, and are more consistent.
---
so you were using cheat engine and trying to abuse an exploit for nearly 2 days straight and think you should be unbannable for it? how entitled can you be lmao
---
it's the equivalent of mapping the inside of a bank and tracking all the workers movements so you can do a "dry run" robbery and when you get caught you just go "lol im trying to help you improve why are you calling the police :\\\^))))))))))"
---
I have played since the the beta, and I've never launched a nuke. Too much hassle for too little reward. I have participated in many sbq kills from other's nukes, and other nuke zones.
---
I'll be honest, I don't know anything about NW bans or suspensions. But it's not the first time people lied about exploiting to get their accounts unbanned. Everyone says that reporting exploits gets you banned but he admits that what happened is it was already reported by another player, but did that player get banned too or were they spared because they reported it?
---
True but why would the dude that has devoted much of his time into making community driven resources to help make the game better lie about being banned unfairly.

Even then, only the shotgun skin was a "Responders" item. The rest were "Fire Fighter" skins.

I will never forget how much you helped me with the game, I will always appreciate the tools you provided me and the community. I’m so sorry it came to this man, I and everyone else appreciate what you’ve done for us players. It’s really depressing to be honest, the fact you gave us so much of your time and effort to improve the game and help people with useful information to make the game easier for us. 
---
I used map76 pretty much everyday, from power armour locations to magazines and bubbleheads.  You’ve done more than what Bethesda could do to help the community and to also have a big impact on the community. It really frustrates me when good people get fucked over.

Because he's part of a group of dataminers who regularly exploit. They repeatedly copy known methods of any and all exploits to ensure they have enough to send in to Bethesda. He got banned because he exploited several times then went to bed. The next day, he says someone else in his group already reported it so he chose not to. He didn't get banned for reporting an exploit, he got banned for not reporting one that he had just done several probably dozens of times
---
Thank you so much
---
The main problem here is that we only hear his side of the story and dont get to see any of the evidence. Bethesda said they investigated his account and it had been proven to break tos multiple times. Repeatedly. I dont think his side is 100% truthful
---
No problem😋
---
Let me try to replicate it and get back to you. I know I've seen the actual text, but if there was an error code number associated, I can't quite recall. Let me find out

u/mayaterror is right, many of our current PA woes came from that patch...

NW cheaters are getting banned. But accounts are $1.50 on resale sights so they just make a new account
---
Actions speak louder than words Bethesda. Find and ban the NW cheaters. Do something.
---
What, everyone who is telling this story of getting banned for reporting an exploit is lying then? All of them?
---
And if you hear and see the rumors going around, are you also seeing everyone hate your Fallout 1st subscription? Are you seeing everyone hate the fact that your games launch broken and never get fixed (Fallout 76 is the worst case, not the only case). Are you seeing people uninstall your game(s) and also how to never buy another Bethesda game? Get your priorities straight before it's too late.
---
I remember gaming back on the NES and replaying the same 3 hours of content over and over and calling that a satisfying game experience. Now with gaming it’s like ‘only dozens of hours of content?  Only whole new side quests introduced after launch with new sheepsquatch enemies, weapons, etc?  Only piles of new camp items available?  Only introducing player vending so we don’t have to bug randoms to trade?  Only an entire new game mode that I enjoyed way more than I expected?  That’s it?!  I need more content!’  :P
---
I’ve been playing the game for nearly a full year now, and I also have not logged on nearly as much lately. But so what?  I got nearly 12 months out of a game I enjoyed. More new content would be nice, and I do plan to pop back in here &amp; there, but I can’t complain too much.

Props for showing the courage to stand up to the mob and explain calmly and efficiently. I fully understand the nuance of your situation. And how you were screwed over by Bethesda. The mob will never. The reactionary tone of their response (obviously to the negative press over your situation) shows me they are tone deaf at Bethesda. Take heart that it is clear their nonsensical backwards handling of bans and exploits ((not fixing them for ages if at all)) has been laid bare for the entire gaming world to see and you were the subject matter if an emergency meeting of media and public relations....and this, their response, sounds but hurt and misses the point entirely of the controversy over their handling of your specific situation. 
---
Clue Bethesda—-over 20 years dealing with consumers—-this is one you could have quickly said mea culpa, restored..no story except how white hat players are working with Bethesda to destroy exploiters and hackers. An all hands on deck to save the game story. Instead it’s a story of your ham fisted ban wave without fixing the exploit story. It’s really self inflicted wounds every single time in the negative stories. It’s amazing how inept the “big” corp is.

---
Oh shit. That’s not good. I’m gonna warn my friend.
---
My headcannon is that music radios starting emitting again recently.
---
Sure, but then I report an exploit and when I ask 'Just to confirm, this seems like an exploit because it bypasses pvp consent in adventure mode, can you confirm you consider it an exploit?" the answer I get is "We don't confirm exploits".  \*Bash head against wall\*.   So now I know people who use this method, I've reported it, and you can't even tell me if you consider it an exploit.   You need people who can do more than reply using a template.
---
Shit... that’s if they even drop with stars at all for me.
---
FWIW: My base is next to a fissure site which frequently spawns 1-3* SB’s. All of them in the last two weeks have dropped 1* with the exception of a single 2* and a single 3*.
---
I can usually gauge how shitty the RNG is by doing Monster Mash. That event has LOTS of hords and takes forever. If I don’t see any 3* during that event, I know the server RNG sucks and I hop servers.
---
Well, that's like, your opinion, man.
---
Or Liberators bots
---
Wow, that is not what I said at all.
---
Also, being that people have fallout 1st, they dont have to worry about weight issues. First members just pick up everything. Metal buckets, enamel buckets, metal tubs... you name it. They can store it. So then comes the point where they say, why buy it when i have 15k already in my box?

yep when you see a video with 20000 thumbs up and 100000 views and the guy is basically just reading a Reddit post and acting all shocked about it, you think, this is how you get Trump
---
Yes, you absolutely can and I have no idea why so many people are saying no :(
---
- Log into your Bethesda account at : https://bethesda.net/en/dashboard
---
- click on your account name and then "Account Management"
---
- click "Edit Account" and then change the display name to what you want it to be.
---
You can do this ONLY once every 90 days so make sure about the name because you'll be stuck with it for 3 months.
---
X0-1 PA and Vampires .50 cal and I laugh at Assaultrons in their face.
---
I haven't seen the new atomic shop items yet but it's possible the skins were a very old leaks since there's atom shop stuff from launch that still hasn't been added
---
Open the map. 
---
The green part is where  you cant drop it. 
---
Everywhere else is free game.
---
Yep. Forgot about that. But F1st won’t affect the in game economy...   🤔😂🤮
---
I’ve never launched a nuke and it’s been a year I’ve been playing. But it’s been on/off playing
---
I do the same; 'Can Do' is just glorified trash diving.
---
[how we finished it 😅](https://1drv.ms/v/s!AkRs6DcTjyx8jWPx_Lmg3tu6ieYW)
---
It was added one patch a while back , think it was in the patch notes but not well advertised still
---
Level 90.... launched my first one around level 75.... spent a while yelling, swearing, sweating and even shed some tears but once I managed to launch it, it was unexpectedly and oddly exhilarating lol 😂
---
Out of my ass
---
Oh the sweet little lies
---
I'm not defending Bethesda I'm just not jumping on a hate train my guy. People lie and try to turn popular opinion to their benefit all of the time, like back when the duper ban wave happened "ohhh I was wrongly banned." lol what you just said was like if I asked you "Genuinely would like to know why you are defending an exploiter"
---
HAHAHAA!!
---
You need to get yourself a Railway Rifle (non-explosive). If you activate a Crit and dump the magazine using full-auto, every railway spike that you shoot before the first one hits counts as a crit.
---
Don’t worry, you’ll be aiming directly at the sky after you’re done holding the trigger - it’s normal. I’m pretty sure if you pop a Nuka Cherry with Cola Nut and a Quad Railway, your torso snaps clean off your waist when you hold the trigger down.
---
I managed to get that during the Halloween Event by reviving someone during one of the events.
---
Same here. On xbox. But mine never worked for me. I did buy it (and selected it as both my loot and death bag) an hour or so   before it was removed from the shop, so I never tested it while it was for sale. There hasn't been an option to reselect it
---
How do I know what's an exploit when most of the game is broken?
---
Besides, you speaking of banning people is ironic seeing how cheaters are rampant in NW and dupers have been doing it since the game came out.
---
So yeah, cool attempt at showing someone's working there besides you...
---
That sounded different to what you were talking about
---
It’s almost like these players think Bethesda talked to every player personally and promised them all some different.    It’s a business.  Business changes.  Not all good....Definitely not.  But choose to be happy not hate.
---
There's that many papers in the game already. They just have to save them out as super special atom shop packs.
---
source: these game files.
---
X01 was made before bombs fell though?
---
Why wouldn't you see similar numbers, just scaled down, vs the SBQ? It doesn't change anything save that both are going to be doing much less damage. The Splitter is still going to do more. 
---
I'm not being nearly as abrasive as you think I'm being. Couple that with you being hostile first? "You wouldnt say those things if you tested them" "I suggest you test before assuming" "please tell me you already knew that"
---
Your language from the get go has been hostile and implying that I don't test anything im talking about, meanwhile, you don't actually test anything you're talking about.
---
Technically no, since they failed to patch the current dupes. But yes, the dupes are still in game.
---
Because it's an empty statement from a corporate employee that is easily disproven by actual players who were banned and all those who weren't and continue to cheat? If this statement at least admitted to bans being random, cherry picked actions it'd be worth pinning it. As is, it's just another lie.
---
 "let Bethesda figure out the details" , let the people who think the only items that need to be wiped are the thirst zapper and acid soaker. Yeah, they clearly have an ear to the ground and know what is going on in the world of exploits in this game. /sarcasim
---
sux bruh. I've found they are never accurate with timed events so I finished getting my NW rewards before the weekend. Go me.
---
1: Irrelevant.
---
2: Yea it's called a cheat engine, but that doesn't mean he was cheating. Bethesda can tell the difference, they chose not to. Knives can be used to stab people. I own a knife. It doesn't automatically be mean I use it to stab people.
---
3: Fair point, though I do not blame him at all. I wouldn't out effort into a game if the devs of said game were punishing me for trying to help.
---
Fixed those facts for ya 😉
---
Mabye he was banned wrongfully mabye he was banned because he should have been baned, but knowing Bethesda's track record and not even caring about the hackers in NW i believe the guy and not Bethesda.
---
I didn't have issues until after today's maintenance
---
Lol I bought it last week too. Just goes to show that you are almost always better off waiting.
---
I'm giving this the downvote treatment thank you very much
---
You knew you had a cheater on your team and opted to leech the free exp from their cheating. I report accomplices like you every chance I get.
---
Oh wow you guys issued a statement for once. A lie but its something.
---
Can you or tell Zenimax to start updating this game frequently to keep is alive and fun.
---
im jealous this happend to you and not me
---
No, the update even states that he didn't use CE in the account that was banned.
---
Seems to me that when the post was forwarded to bethesda, they just check if usernames matched and banned the accounts that did.
---
Your sarcasm is noted, but you comment is just a distraction to the conversation and is a complete waste of time. Thank you.
---
There's one near the barn in the fields of the Aaronholt Homestead with the power armor chasis spawn - it's listed as an Ash Blossom until you pick it up
---
There are so many in the garden behind the steak house!
---
I dont know for sure but you could try building a small generator and sitting it down first?
---
I had this issue but it wasnt because of a vending machine. It was because I had someone else build something in my camp that I didnt have plans for.
---
F
---
Correct.
---
Um... what part?
---
Were never gonna get another good single player Bethesda rpg because now they know people will nit only buy but also pay a $100 sub for a mess. Thanks.
---
You can still hit Morgantown and Charleston, weirdly not considered the Forest
---
I am on the opposite side of the nuclear spectrum. I have launch over 200 nukes since launch. 
---
I am probably the player that launches nukes every 5 minutes. Lol. 
---
I just enjoy running through the silos, and completing the mission control. Then jumping to the next silo. 
---
I start at site Charlie, Alpha, Bravo. 
---
Personally, I think that the Enclave should be doing unauthorized nuclear warfare on Appalachia on a regular basis. 
---
I think it would give the game more dynamics.  Or even at the least, on SB queen once every  couple hours. 
---
I find that nuclear launches bring players together, and create an interesting environment, and element of survival. As long as the game doesn't crash. 
---
That seems to be the only downside to doing nuke launches a late. 
---
I also enjoy collecting flux, I usually have about 20 peices of each for sale at my camp on a regular basis. 
---
And the best place to collect 4 different spectrums of flux is actually at Whitesprings. Crimson, Florescent, Yellow Cake, Cobalt. 10 peices of each on average, depending on where you launch.
---
 Ferry Harper, for Violet. 
---
Best adventure, for a nuke launch is at Tanagra Town, and the Toxic Lakebed. Just really eerie, and just a really cool experience to waste a nuke on, in my opinion. 
---
Nonetheless I hope you get the opportunity to launch a  Black Betty at some point, with in your gaming experiences. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best!
---
I'm on PS4
---
Guys there’s still room in my life boat and I’m not leaving until all seats are filled
---
No, that isn't what he did at all.  This is a huge false analogy.  To correct it, it would be if he did all that work and was going to hand it in to the bank to fix but his teammate already turned in a similar report first so he didn't bother.
---
Thanks InnovSurvivalist
---
People who give back to the community SHOULD get some leeway.  Just as George Orwell used lies to tell the truth, politicians use lies to hide it.  Intent SHOULD be more important than action.
---
I've been playing since BETA and have put in over a thousand hours so far: never even stepped foot inside of a silo
---
Have an upvote yourself😀
---
Do you have turrets? Maybe you need to put your home defense perk card on - I've run into that a few times because I have the rocket launchers on my build and when I go move it, it won't set down w/o putting that perk card on.
---
He said he was reading memory and scanning values with CE, not that he was changing them. He states pretty clearly that thats how he reversed engineered the exploit, but it was an in game exploit.
---
Seems like a lot of people here don't know how datamining works and just hearing CE makes them think he was somehow fiddling with server side data.
---
Never have need a group to help.
---
&gt; I guess I’m confused by your logic here. Should you get a pass because you create community tools?
---
In my opinion, totally.  The sheer amount of dedication and work that went into Map76 shows a level of good will that should at least get them a second look over.  It shows a history of using these grey area tools for white hat work and should have earned them the benefit of the doubt.
---
Same here!
---
Well thank you very much! 😁
---
Maybe they are sending NW the way of Survival - don't fix the issues, let it get worse until most of the players quit, then get rid of the mode because it's "unpopular" then they can focus ALL their attention on finishing the base game!
---
Cool way to deflect question my question with coarse language included.
---
You be you bro, no point arguing with internet stranger who only posts here to hate on fanbase and game.
---
Im ps4
---
Telekinesis 
---
/pedant
---
I just bump into it
---
Yeah grafting Area always spawns flux after being nuked good area to farm in tbh I’ve picked a ton up and still don’t know what I need them for lol
---
That is a great point.
---
Charleston is Ash Heap, Morgantown is Toxic Valley
---
Of course he's lying, that's what you do when you get banned for doing shit you shouldn't have.  You go to the games official forum or sub and vent about how you did nothing wrong and everyone else is to blame. That's also why the majority of his manifesto is whining about random stuff everyone complains about, to get people on his side and extra pissed at Bethesda.
---
Respond to your Fallout 1st controversy, we haven’t forgotten about that.
---
meh, getting a hwid changer from you-know-where isn't too difficult either
---
Putting down a camp from the blueprint can really suck.  I always assume that if I move my camp, that I will have to rebuild it from scratch. 😬
---
I killed a 3* super mutant earlier and the loot drop reset to being just a regular.
---
Not mad but it was frustrating cause I’m still low level solo adventuring.
---
Have two
---
There are currently only those three that remain in terms of the Ranger outfit series. There were also various skins found among other things. Personally I don't mind it since I am essentially getting a deal on atoms with an outfit and other perks, that is how I see this whole thing.
---
OK Bethesda
---
Oh no! I play with some of your buddies! Who was it?
---
Yeah, it was added maybe 2 months back.
---
I noticed a slight change in the background music earlier....
