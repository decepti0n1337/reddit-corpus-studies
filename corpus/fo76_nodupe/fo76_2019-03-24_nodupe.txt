It's super fun. I've been casually playing since launch. If you aren't focused on rushing to the "endgame" and just take your time enjoying the environment and quests it's great. 
---

---
My best elevator pitch for this game is that it's like Gone Home/Everyone's Gone to the Rapture but with guns. 
---
---
---
There's been some xp nerfs since that was written. Not to mention doing the list beforehand would take up time.
---
You're the one who trusted him. 
---
its a unholy grind you have to do, to manage it in 8 hours...
---
I will  Ã∂dÃ∂iÃ∂eÃ∂  try again. I'm still afraid. Thanks.
---
Sometimes sentinel isn't listed on the item name, you just know by seeing it has 15% damage reduction by standing and not moving
---
I want wallpaper and curtains
---
‚ÄúA bunch of assholes from Vault 76 did it‚Äù is now canon. 
---
Called in a satellite strike. It killed me, but everyone else was ok.
---
I can help with the nuke codes... You need all 8 for the same silo. There are 3 silos, Alpha, Bravo &amp; Charlie.  Then go to the white spring bunker &amp; look at the silo board for the silo you have the keys for. Then just like in the Sunday papers of yesteryear, decode the cryptogram to get the word, which will give you the nuke code to enter inside of that bunker. Every Monday at 7pm the codes change. You will also need a nucular ID card, which you will order a drop for. Then you can head to the bunker. Bring at least 100 stimpaks &amp; lots of fire power, as you battle an endless nightmare of robots.
---
I am also on ps4, if you get stuck, look me up leester39.
---
Good luck &amp; let me know if you need any thing else. 
---
Somebody understands me
---
Good luck!
---
Sure, but they should have new common masks each year and not give out the original batch. Next year, don't give out the Witch, Soldier, Owl, Giant, or Toothy Man Masks, and give out a different group instead.
---
And have ***MORE*** Common Masks. Maybe 15 instead of 5.
---
Level 50 T-51b has the best ballistic and energy damage resistance but low radiation resist. So perfectly viable at high level. 
---
I will give it another try. Maybe I just aimed too low. I love that weapon any way!!
---
8 HOURS TO GET TO LEVEL 50!?
---
It took me 200 hours to get to level 75!
---
Yeah I was thinking adding ingredients to existing normal ammo to make them ultracite ammo üëå
---
I have maxed out starched genes, the only mutation I have is marsupial 
---
Sure is.
---
Just did it today üòÖ, but that 3rd beast was completely bugged inside the walls.
---
Is there a brotherhood skin available for it? I know there‚Äôs one for T-60 but I‚Äôve been after T-51.
---
Thanks for understanding. That would be a good idea.
---
I use perfect storm or a suppressors combat shotgun as my oh shit guns. Pretty decent for rushing groups. 
---
Thnx
---
Take over a power plant and hook a fusion generator to the core creator.
---
I just hate that when they said some are exceedingly rare, what they meant was, HALF are exceedingly rare.
---
They don't?
---
I think one of the recent update bright it back because ran into it a few weeks ago. I sat there and shot at it once each time it flew past, eventually got the kill.
---
200 compaired to how many boxes of pre war food?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I had 2 normal ones and a 3rd completely bugged. She could fly through EVERYTHING, hit me, and I almost couldn't hit her 
---
Seriously? 
---
This 100% 
---
You're better off killing the sentry bots at whitesprings, there are 3 of them. They usually give you 75% to 100% fusion cores. Server hop, repeat. 
---
This is quite a good idea. While you have went to great lengths to balance the process, the main problem is that permanent or long term storage has an irregular value. Its value is almost entirely convenience. As such, the increased ingredient cost means there is little reason to actually can something.
---
I would move to req. to : can (no constituent elements, just a can), boiled water, 2x food items, 2 wood, so canned corn soup would be can, 2 corn, boiled water, 2 wood.
---
I dropped 15k .308 ammo in front of WS vendor bot when I decided to prime a MG42 lol 
---
Can you be on in a few hours
---
Yeah
---
Yeah why?
---
No such thing as a legendary scorch Beast. Plus it‚Äôs in the forest region.... so no the lower levels would get killed so fast. 
---
Perhaps they can give the artists atoms?
---
I'm sure there will be, the game will be expanded with new quests. There's probably not a major location in game that doesn't already have planned story arcs and missions.  Give them time.
---
I hate when I have shutters and while I'm crafting a player starts opening and shutting them.
---
Good thing I now have a brick building.
---
I am on PS4 by the way
---
If you are on PC you can have mine.
---
I think it looks stupid.
---
Cool! I‚Äôm going out for the night, I‚Äôll meet up with you tomorrow if that‚Äôs cool. 
---
Haha a little high for something people are trying to get rid of a lot of the time
---
I could roll it back to standard. 
---
Get a junk collector at your base. Super easy 
---
Its only an issue for big corporate expensive songs, theres a plethora of music out there thats 50's or 50's inspired that wouldn't cost as much as the bigger more known songs.
---
The Jazz songs on L.A Noire for example , they could hire a band to record some Jazz or Blues or something.
---
I'm on xbox and this happened to me but with that moon mask from the atom shop
---
*slaps the top of the gun, causing it to accidentally fire*
---
This is the sleek sport model. We take the cheapest plastic and duct tape we can use to fool you into thinking you get more for your money. 
---
Hey, are you on?
---
*vault boy. Not pip boy.
---
Fine 50 caps
---
Hmmm, yeah maybe you might need to put a little arc on it. I aim it a little up when I shoot it.
---
Awesome! I‚Äôm stepping out for the night, I‚Äôll catch you tomorrow if that‚Äôs cool. If I have any you need still we can swap and I‚Äôll hook up the OP with whatever else he needs. 
---
You might want to check to make sure you don't have a higher level turret or something that requires you to use a different perk card. That held me up until I realized and equipped the right cards. 
---
In the long run that is likely a better idea, probibly with the cans being crafted at the tinkers bench for one steel and one lead to create 2 cans. As most loot cans are crushed, so the none crushed ones will be of a higher value.  
---
Go watch the series "the 100", which is referenced by this location. Its a really good series as well. 
---
And if I remember the ingredients for them from my workbench, they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúcheap‚Äù. You‚Äôre better off to take a power plant workbench like the other guy said and then fire up the fusion core processor. You don‚Äôt have to restart the power plant, you just have to hook up one or more generators to it to power it. You can get quite a few cores relatively quickly from it, as long as no one contests your workshop or you can defend it.
---
I hate that you lose caps in general. Especially when I lose over 100 caps when i lose to someone. They should just have a betting system like borderlands.
---
I have to keep dropping them since they are so common
---
going on 50 this point....
---
I strongly agree
---
 Good idea. 
---
My main is a tse handmade as well. I also carry a aa dragon for pvp, and a instigating sniper rifle as a back-up. Shotguns are good too, but the preceding three all use rifleman perks.....
---
Yes. There are 2. Well. technically 1, but also 3.
---
Fusion cores _can_ be crafted. They require one of each kind of the stable flux making them extremely expensive to craft. (You can also craft prime fusion cores but they are very pointless.)
---
A much easier solution is to take over a workshop with a fusion core generator -- generally found at nuclear power plants. You'll get a handful of fully charged cores every hour provided you don't mind babysitting a workshop.
---
Of course you could just walk around and farm cores from the many power armor suits, fusion generators and reliable fusion core spawn points that appear in the world. This is not very reliable as many fusion cores do not spawn reliably or they may have been looted or the power core may have only a minimal charge. But the important thing to keep in mind is that once you hit the late game fusion cores are not as rare as the early games leads you to believe so long as you know where to look.
---
Ok thanks didn‚Äôt know if it was still possible after the purge
---
I finally bought the Sledgehammer plans from Graham after months of searching.
---
It‚Äôs under the lights section in camp mode. 
---
Considering you still can buy legendary armor and weapons online that many YouTubers push it doesn't surprise me at all! 
---
Yup
---
I have scrapped three handmade of various mod types I found as drops. When scrapping, why does it never give me a mod? I can scrap a combat rifle/ shotgun or anything else and get mods. Do I need the plans first? Haven't noticed with other weapons
---
It's not just about getting a silly cosmetic. It's about collecting unique, event-themed items to feel like I'm doing my part in supporting something bigger than myself. They're symbols that say "I not only care about this game, but I've had a lot of good times with friends in the process. I'm a member of this community."
---
I partially agree with OP's post- this event is absolutely about "allowing everyone to join up and have fun". I only wish that the cosmetic system they've put in place wasn't too dissimilar from the plans;  no differentiating rarity levels, just a flat, equal percent chance for each mask to drop across the board. It creates a much more fair market for trading, I feel confident that I'll get all the drops as long as I'm dedicated, and it's more inclusive rather than exclusive. 
---
It's awesome they made the event accessible to all. The bots are all hilarious and show genuinely enjoyable character traits. There are a lot of great foundations here, but that's why it's such a shame that this little aspect is encompassing the event. I very much understand where others' frustrations are coming from.
---
Added with FalloutES
---
Sorry I needed the leather.  
---
are there other doors?  because there's a code panel next to one door, and if you find the code you can get in. 
---
I had this happen to me, some kind person on Reddit pointed out that my chat audio in the game settings was likely ay 0%, it was.  It keeps resetting itself there when I log in so I'd say check that every time you log on.  I'm on PS4 so I don't know if it's a bug on Xbox or PC as well.
---
When they just stand and stare. No emotes. I was crafting, but thought I heard footsteps. I turned around to see two low levels.
---
It could have been worse. At least they weren‚Äôt breathing heavily over the mic. 
---
Only legacy items are explosive energy weapons. You have to trade for those as they no longer drop, everything else can drop.
---
If he isn't going to take you up on that offer I will..
---
I carry on average 5-6 weapons but if you just want a backup for when your favorite breaks then go with something you are used to. Your weapon automatic? Try a 10mm smg. Semiautomatic? Try a lever action rifle or even a customized hunting rifle.
---
Can you kill people at the parade? I don't even see their health bar during the event.
---
Yes this is a bit behind and to the West of that I believe
---
People in my camp
---
I know but I‚Äôve looked everywhere in the lights they aren‚Äôt there I can recheck 
---
Wait. Are you on Xbox? I‚Äôm on PC :p
---
What bother me is when people lock their doors. I found one today who also had roller doors. Used the power armour through window glitch to get in then opened these doors so anyone else, including enemies were able to get in. When I left the owner turned up looking very confused
---
Might have 2 will check tomorrow. 
---
nope didnt work, cant interact.
---
Risk v. Reward
---
You don‚Äôt have to claim anyone‚Äôs bounty but if you do you open yourself up to PvP. A lot of people with high bounties have good gear so a normal weapon probably won‚Äôt cut it, you need an AA or bloodied build to be viable in PvP.
---
What was the nerf to melee?
---
Yeah xbone, lol! 
---
The storms also blow in from the Glowing Sea 
---
Luckily for me it was only my excavator armor. It's a good thing Bethesda games are so well tested lol.
---
That one is common. The common ones are toothy, giant, witch, owl, and I think soldier or something like that. 
---
Try relogging see if it updates 
---
That‚Äôs when I smash camps. I normally do not advocate trashing someone‚Äôs camp but when they set up at whitesprings by the club or behind the shops, I go to town on them. 
---
Nothing enrages me more when I‚Äôm playing than some jackwagon xp farming like this, making the server lag and screwing up the respawns for the rest of us. 
---
Sounds good to me! Have fun, and we‚Äôll see you then!
---
Patience is a virtue, if you want it I‚Äôll help you out but chill with the timer man I‚Äôm trying to do you a favor here but real life comes first 
---
Isn‚Äôt the base damage for black power like 200? Add in a few fully upgraded perks and there‚Äôs your answer. I don‚Äôt bother with PvP period. If they start, I just stand there, if they continue, I heckle them on the Mic till they go away. 
---
PvP is shit because most of the time unless you are openly seeking PvP, you have your perks setup for whatever you are doing at the time. So if I am out picking flux, and get attacked, I have none of the necessary perks equipped to PvP. Not to mention not wanting to risk losing my junk. Meanwhile, they are all decked out for PvP.  Like, while I‚Äôm getting consistent slap damage, I‚Äôm just going to take 5 minutes to scroll through the menus and equip what I require to level the odds. IF I even have the proper weapons and armor on me. Glad they‚Äôre finally separating PvP from PvE.  THEN those griefer assholes will feel proper punishment and defeat when we are all prepared to throw down. 
---
I have seen him twice since I started way back in the beta days... but it‚Äôs been months now 
---
They should also be unscrappable.
---
Yes glowing sea is the reason of frequent rad storms in Commonwealth
---
Oh. I should‚Äôve noted the GT. I‚Äôm so sorry :O
---
They should also be unscrappble.
---
I spotted it at the top of Seneca and it scared the shit out of the me by Annie's bunker in the Mire
---
I have 7, and it annoys me.
---
You know FO76 doesn't officially support mods. If you use them, do so in the knowledge that they may break the game
---
Ha! I would always close the door behind me at other people‚Äôs‚Äô CAMPS, so I get what you mean. 
---
I actually like it when people leave my door open though, because I always close my door when I leave, so this is how I know that someone has been there...
---
How many weapons plans are in game anyway? 
---
Is this the "Juice head" who does the YouTube videos? 
---
You're right. I completely forget about the mods
---
Yea yea from someone that‚Äôs been playing senes the beginning. The reason it‚Äôs underrated now is because it was a dumpster fire for months after it was released. 
---
Do force respawn a work still? I thought that got patched. 
---
Thank you. I forgot about the mods
---
I'm surprise they didn't join your camp and delete stuff.
---
&gt; they just want their latte, dammit ! 
---
I'd rather drink coffee personally.
---
I‚Äôll let you know how it goes 
---
Yes 
---
I get you, that's why just simple skins would be nice... As a start. Then start with weapons, bundles etc. 
---
This guy is claiming he got the jester mask: 
---
Only problem is the playlist is synced to the server not the individual player
---
I hate that too. I guess it needs to be in the game because there has to be some kind of consequence to PvP. I just completely avoid PvP as I find it pretty bullshit in this.  The entire system involving slap damage until you both engage but also there's a pacifist mode... It's a mess and pretty flawed. People can leave up pacifist mode until they make their move so you're only doing slap damage and then boom, super sledge, you're dead. I wish "survival" mode meant the regular game was now PvE mode.
---
Unfortunately that's not what this game wants to be. So I'll just continue to avoid it entirely and leave up pacifist. If anyone tries to grief I just leave the server. It sucks but I've had my camp leveled by sociopaths enough times now.
---
I'm starting to know exactly what songs going to be next and I'm only level 30 üòÇ 
---
No it still works and but it doesn‚Äôt if there is anyone closely nearby
---
Look out for an atom shop skin or mod for it whatever you don‚Äôt want scrapped. Not many options, but it works very well if you come across something. 
---
A few mines at their benches and a little justified griefing goes a long way. 
---
If you don‚Äôt want to lose caps then don‚Äôt pick a fight with someone, just avoid the player. Its costly to wear someone down who isn‚Äôt fighting back so they‚Äôll just stop. If you want to fight then there needs to be risk on both sides otherwise what incentive do I have to fight the bounty hunter? I‚Äôd just run away till they realized it wasn‚Äôt worth the time.
---
For the record I don‚Äôt pick fights over anything but workshops and even then I try and avoid it if possible. I don‚Äôt think that I should be additionally penalized for pvp in a designated pvp activity
---
Good luck. 
---
wow this is rediculous..
---
It was a squad of people in a nuke zone yesterday and they accidentally hit us so we killed all them. And some even came back for revenge which makes it even better
---
No worries on the delay! Technically, you aren't normally supposed to be able to build on the bridge, but I found a spot that makes it possible. I used stairs to build up from the base, then connected the foundations to stairs to actually place them. My only issue is that one stupid brick got in the way of my last foundation.
---
that would be nice, theres lots of great music from that time period
---
I hate that nobody wanders up to my camp when I‚Äôm not there. 
---
If you use max level "White Knight" perk it only costs 1 ballistic fiber :)   Look up youtube if you need help finding ballistic fiber, there are some good spots and with White Knight youll only need to go farm them up once and it will last you a while.
---
The Queen is legendary. Also, they can easily implement one.
---
&gt; If had paid 60 I definitely would not be getting my monies worth
---
I paid 55 EUR for it.  300-odd hours so far.  Did I get my moneys worth?
---
The worst has to be when a squad used their power armour to block the door ways so no one could get in for a full 60s. 
---
Easy fix, don‚Äôt watch youtubers. Maybe they‚Äôll complain so much they get real jobs!
---
Compared to the rare masks not that rare. I've done the parade, oh, 20-25 times and I've got 3. You probably have a 1:10 maybe 1:20 chance in getting this. It's also a secondary reward so the drop rate isn't dependent on protecting all the bots like the masks are. (There's like ~20 secondary rewards btw: the beret, 2 recipes and a ton of Fashnacht decor plans. I would guess these all have an equal chance of spawning, if at first you don't succeed, server hop and try again.)
---
Doesn't bother me. Username is the same as my reddit name
---
I hate when they come in use your stuff leave the door open and stare at you with a super sledge. 
---
Just make a new character. I believe the option is available on main menu in the characters menu.
---
So the guy was trying to prevent a customer from buying something from the store he worked for?  That's grounds for instant termination in *France* for fucks sake,
---
A cosmetic buff is absolutely fine.
---
Whenever you are somewhere at high altitude, look around at the world below you.
---
You‚Äôll often see dark clouds dumping rain on a part of the map that‚Äôs far in the distance...it‚Äôs not for show, it‚Äôs actually raining there. 
---
I found several posts via Google of others that have games crashing if chrome is open. It could be chrome hardware acceleration or some combination of updates that need to be installed or reinstalled. I think that chrome is a memory hog if you have a lot of Windows or tabs open, so it's probably best to close it when playing games.
---
Why even have ready made ammo in the first place? More junk and let everybody make their ammo from the beginning. 
---
People wanting to trade with no mic. 
---
Especially given that you only collect as much of the bounty as the wanted player has caps.
---
I am just trying to get rid of them and let other make use of them without needing to drop them onto the ground like it is some kind of junk.
---
Not by the time the event is over. Maybe by next year
---
That‚Äôs a rip. Then by then mid the ghouls are dead
---
For me I use a lever as main a laser rifle as second and 10mm as back up. I have gauss rifle with but the laser just feels so much better. 
---
Sorry but you told be 30 mins, now an hour and six min has pass, so you been standing me up, sorry, I can't wait longer then 10 more mins.
---
I have a life too.
---
Well I guess you have a point. Expectations are at lowest and that makes an impact on my perception. 
---
This is correct. I started a new character recently and switch back and forth, depending on my mood. 
---
Nah they were are dead. Only thing alive was the two legendary stags and the two legendary deathskull radscorpions on the lawn. 
---
what was the name of the level 41?
---
This would be highly unlikely. I don't think there's decent tech to do this right now, if *any* tech. Not to mention the various accents and speech impediments they'd have to account for.
---
The game is better than Perceived. Everyone just hates it due to youtubers saying to hate it. 
---
What was it, it's deleted?
---
Same.  I‚Äôve had 4 survive, 3 survive, and 2 survive.  Unless it‚Äôs 5, I don‚Äôt get a mask.
---
Nah, it seems that pets don't count. I just watched some dickhead kill my pet deathclaw right in front of me and it didn't even try to defend itself. My turret didn't either. 
---
I sure did. Chased him down and murdered him, ate his corpse. Earning me a 50 cap bounty. That'll teach him.
---
I need a tse drill. I‚Äôm playing on a Commodore 64, but it‚Äôs overclocked......
---
Well, they‚Äôre also missing from the song end credits when they updated them to be an hour long.
---
Then try puting them in common storages/boxs for players to find and get for free.
---
I do that a lot with all my extra junk or legendarys  I will but them in a cashier at White Springs

You do realise that you are not restricted to phrases other people have used before?  If the words are correctly spelled and in a grammatically correct order it's a phrase.
---
Fullscreen and i tried all of them to be real
---
Except the guy I saw yesterday who built one covered with missile turrets, on the cliff overlooking where the sloth spawns. Fuck that guy. Went to town on that camp, sadly he quit before I could destroy the whole thing.
---
I bet you're fun at parties.
---
Red Eye and Vera Keyes did add new songs in their DLCs. They were original songs, not licensed.
---
The Mysterious broadcast reuses songs already heard in the main game in the casinos.
---
lol 
---
It‚Äôs mentioned above with ‚ÄúSwinging on a Star‚Äù and ‚ÄúTumbling Tumbleweeds‚Äù.
---
I hate the LVL up challenges. At a high LVL, I rarely even LVL up 3 times a week
---
Lol no it definitely still rains indoors. This post is fiction.
---
We're a few months away from an extension in IP rights expiring, resulting in literally millions of songs hitting the public realm.  There's a good chance there could be a huge song update late this year. 
---
Mine had an icon over it and said "owned" when I looked at it. I assumed other people see the same thing. Maybe they dont? 
---
Not being able to plant my crops into the ground deeper on hillsides so that it doesn't look like they're floating. I'm looking at you, razorgrain.

&gt; First Fallout game I couldn't finish.
---
Uh, the game has no end, nobody can "finish" it.  That's the point.
---
I have 2 of them, want one?
---
The way I got him to stay was to just stay in the trade screen with him. As soon as I heard somebody else was around me I'd back out and let them trade. It work for awhile. I ended up leaving after like 20 mins and he was still up
---
There's a risk for you to go after that bounty. It wouldn't make the bounty system any fun if they got nothing out of it for having a giant marker on the map with bounties coming out of their pocket.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong the state of 76 right now is amazing. I‚Äôm vary happy with the steeps Bethesda has taken to fix the game, and would recommend it to any Fallout fan. However for months it was a real struggle to get on and play everyday. 
---
Tank Killer
---
A whole field? Isn‚Äôt there a limit to the number of mines you can place? I remember laying down like 3 mines and every third mine would make the first one explode
---
Yeah, I have all the 8 brovo codes, I have the I'd card, and such. I lack firepower, I will need to fix that first I guess. Most of my gear is 45 and myself being 63 it's a big gap.
---
Not camping at their camp but INSIDE the building so he can't relog to force them to respawn. 
---
one thing I have noticed.  when in my pipboy, if I'm looking at my items then tab over to my character it will still show whatever item I was looking at behind the character screen at like a shadow menu.  hope this helps.
---
Bobbleheads: one in the bookshop just behind the Super Duper Mart, on the counter with the duffle bag, one on the roof of the High School (near the tent), two in the Transit Hub lobby (on the counter and in the secure room), three upstairs in the EMS building, and I'm sure that's just the tip of the iceberg.
---
Hell yeah man what do you want for it? I'm lvl 12 or something low but I can give caps/basic junk
---
Quitting for today.... thanks for standing me up.
---
Very few guns have "mechanical bits" in the barrel.
---
My problem  now is  that my  walls  and  ceilings  don't  align properly.Walls don't  seem to  lineup and sometimes have visible gaps between  them  that can't seem to be fixed.  I've been rarely able to adjust them,  but like on the  next  world  load, it  reverts.  Dunno what's  up, never deal with  it  in  Fallout  4.
---
Perfect upvotes.
---
I have a friend who played about 3 hrs of the beta, and 5 hrs after release. He tried to do 1 quest involving killing a deathclaw and said "its not at the marker - broken game" and hasn't  played since. Now he keeps asking how I can enjoy such a broken game and wont listen to reason. Some people just can't be reasoned with. 
---
Fair enough. I never wanna be that guy.
---
The meat claw with extra claws murders it with good melee and unarmed perks
---
I don't need anything, you can have it. What is your account?
---
Its spotty about working in fo4, same as fo76...
---
Right? Whoever gets them can probably trade them for a whole pile of sentinel assassin sets or bloody explosive whatevers.
---
I wasn't even looking for him one time and he was clear over near the EMS building fighting about 6 protectrons and a assaltron. He's a beast.
---
My camp is right by there, love it
---
There are no "saves" because it's online.
---
There's only characters. You can have up to 5 and switch back and forth whenever you want to at the main menu under "Characters". There will be an option there for "new character"
---
Reply late but here's my advice:
---
1. Ammo. Get Excavator PA and hit up Lucky Hole Mine (close to the Asylum). You'll clear 350-400 lead ores due to Excavator's bonuses; combine that with Super Duper and you'll be swimming in lead scrap. At that point the real problem is steel, easily solved with a couple runs of WestTek (scrap all the weps you find, and you get a lot of gun powder drops).
---
2. Chems, water etc.,. Pharma Farma is a big help here and the Asylum is my preferred place. As another said be sure to manually search the containers vs. just open them. Also plenty of steel and plastic here. But the real secret to getting overloaded on chems is events. Farm events and your new problem is what to do with all these stims, and rad-xs, and water, etc,.
---
We have power and all the required chemicals. Make it a plan!
---
I server hop each time, I'll keep at it then huh!
---
From the fair. I have one.
---
  
---
Cost 25 token tokens I think? Maybe 50?
---
I'll take them off your your hands and just charge you a low 25 caps per core for safety disposal fee.

It's pretty fun. They have a roadmap out for updates for the rest of the year. [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019)
---
Next week is the survival mode update, which functionally adds a PvP mode and turns the current mode (now called Adventure mode) into a PvE mode. PvP rules will be less strict in Survival mode, while PvP will be nerfed in Adventure mode. The big quest updates are coming soon. We did get a small Brewing quest which lets us make alcoholic drink and get recipes from a drunk robot. There's also a seasonal event going on right now where you can get cosmetic masks and new cosmetic CAMP items.
---
Something really neat you can do is build a CAMP (yes, all caps) almost anywhere. It's freeform, you're limited by the max build budget and the premade build items. This sub shows what you can build.

I believe his internet was to get him to buy a different game instead. One that he believed was a better one by his own standards. I was fucking pissed, told the guy to buy whatever he wants, that the employee should just mind his own business and just ring him up 
---
Message me when youre ready. Im down to fight
---
A fully maxed T-51 has higher energy and ballistic resistance than a full modded X-01.  The Radiation resistance is just under 400 however, which is lower. Where X-01 shines is being really strong across every category.  
---
I would be astonished if the drop rates that were predicted are correct. If they are, it would be pure luck. There's no basis for believing that those numbers are an accurate representation of drop rates. 
---
You're welcome to believe what you want. 
---
You'll get better xp on the pvp servers. It's around +20% if I recall correctly. You'd probably do just fine starting a new character on the pvp servers. You might get killed while trying to level a bit, but it seems like you're interested in pvp, so if you can't handle getting killed then you might want to go back to candy crush or whatever...
---
There are some streaming Fallout radio stations on YouTube 
---
That's a lot of work on an idea that they won't adopt and even if they did they'd come up with their stuff and not use your ideas. 
---
Not bad, just a weird use of time. 
---
Alright buddy sounds good üëåüèΩ 
---
Haha 
---
76 BAD
---
WITCHER 3 GOOD
---
What specifically happens? You put on the pipboy and then immediately get disconnected?
---
If it's constantly happening, try reaching out to Bethesda support on Twitter or put in a ticket on their website. That doesn't sound like a common issue
---
Yeah, each time the game updates make sure you do a clean run to make sure.
---
A lot of accounts have been unlocked lately that were banned for duping and such.
---
Many likely got the email and are just back at the same antics, minus actively breaking the server as much.
---
What‚Äôs your user name
---
That was an "of each list"
---
give me 6 ahah.
---
Oneeyedcole
---
Oh nice, that'd be awesome!
---
Plus you can farm them at Sunshine Meadows Industrial Farm
---
I don't recall his level going up after being scorched, but yes he was level 21 when first acquired. He'd move around a bit while loading in, but once an object loaded in he'd immediately agro onto it and stay aggroed until I left and came back, at which point he would have likely targeted something else. 
---
I'll take a gander at it.  thinking of doing this for my second toon.
---
Haters gonna hate 
---
Ive been hounding a guy for 2 days for the winter man mask, and he wont budge to sell me it.
---
What is your name in game? On now.
---
Automated doors keeps it nice and close. If only wiring wasn't so ugly. Tripwires that just function as a pressure plate would help a lot.
---
That's not how probability even works. üò•
---
Yes. Sometimes I'll only get passed setting up the character's looks. When I log back in again, it shows my character with my name on the loading screen, but then it takes me to the part where I have to make a new character.
---
I was in one the other day with someone using the "no robots" protest signs.
---
I rattled my lips like a horse 
---
Dude I am too if I'm still playing, but loosing faith/interest fast with shit like this fasnacht event. I have a loot box full of legit not duped 3\* stuff that I got from drops that don't seem to be happening. Want to save it to see what this legendary vendor is going to do with it?
---
Pectin is just a polysaccharide, basically multiple sugars put together. It's very similar to amylopectin which is one of the building blocks of starch. 
---
It might be in animal fat, I don't know, but Pectin =/= animal fat.
---
What I'm saying doesn't preclude the possibility that there's also a problem. 
---
But self-reported drop rates based on a relatively small sample of participants can't possibly be an accurate predictor. 
---
No, but I've been tempted to wreck those shit ones that look like upside down pyramids. 
---
Same name as it is here, PatrickJr
---
Do it man, those are also on my hit list... or buildings that are slightly floating
---
What platform are you on? If your on Xbox I'll buy one. 
---
I would like to sell them not spend caps to give you them
---
What happened for you? I may have got lucky but for me 1 mr gutsy, level 50  or so came out of a pod at a time, I would kill it and then the next came. I was level 41 when I beat it and it only took 1 try. I think all up I killed 6 mr gutsys and maybe a protectron or 2.
---
Glad the upcoming update, will stop people like being able to ruin the game for others.
---
im in aswell. GT: Exqlusive 
---
Same. Trying it right now, still bugged. Everything is in my on-character inventory.

I followed him once on his Crusade of Terror and he literally looped Watoga before he went back home.

Phoenix is the Robot Badass I wish I could build as a Companion! 
---
Youre my new hero and ill build a statue in your honor someday
---
That worked. I just don't understand how it happens in the first place. 
---
Have played almost 50 hours and I didn't know that they where even a part of the game.
---
I'll find a way, hopefully
---
&gt; I believe his internet
---
Intent?  sounds like you're being abused by your spell checker.
---
Are you sure that alcohol doesn't count as a drug?
---
I'm a blast at parties. 
---
How is following people through a building experiencing it? You'll be waiting for them to clear the room, then the next. Then the next. Looting is literally the only thing you'll be able to do.
---
It's like sitting on the back seat of a car to get the experience of driving. 
---
Did you have them over-repaired with Weapon Artisan?  The amount of bonus damage will slowly decay back to the normal amount as  the over-repair (white bar) is depleted.
---
If you could destroy the stairs and watch the whole thing come down it would be hard not to at that point 
---
You're thinking of gelatin. Pectin is found in ripe fruits.
---
Pretty much you just need to find one of those spawn points and server hop until you find what you're looking for. A bit tedious, but that's the quickest way to do it.
---
You do have to make sure that they are *completely* by themselves, as even some other NPC(s) spawning nearby might invalidate the tame condition.
---
Patience... the aliens are in all the modern games. They will be a thing. Already have the blaster. Now we just wait for it..
---
In-game text states that taking a second chem either refreshes the duration (same chem) or cancels the first effect to apply the new one (different chem), in marked contrast to previous games.
---
Sort of the point as that makes the farm extremely valuable. 
---
If No Man's Sky can pull off a rebound then any game can
---
That's close enough to get the general idea (it's a bit higher than that in reality, but not a lot)
---
If something takes way to long to break I just launch a nuke at it (unless it's in the forest safe zone) pretty much looks the same if you watch it crumble from just outside the blast zone
---
My main gun is an explosive handmade for back up I  carry a furious handmade and instigating double barrel. 
---
Nice, because what people want to do in an adventure game is have to stop and collect resources they already had in place to repair their camp...
---
I found a static plan spawn at Grafton steel.
---
Kill mutants and scorched, grab every damn gun off them and scrap them. You‚Äôll get the component parts and occasionally a plan for a mod. I scrap every thing that‚Äôs not legendary (which I sell to vendors). 
---
Damn, I'm going to have to do this whole thing from the start, so far I've only run across it towards the end and it's just been a boring shit-fest of X-01 wearing marsupials oneshotting stuff with their explosive shotties,  Yawn.
---
Put food in fermenter. End up with pickles.
---
Hey there! Looks like you were trying to say "is anyone else an absolute dickhead?", but you made a typo and said "Anyone else wreck homes if they're nicer than yours?"
---
This is a simple mistake that should be easy to fix.
---
Have a nice day
---
-- The Paperclip
---
Bethesda after the game started to flop started finding what was wrong with the game and fixing them.Heck,I was a day onener  and I'm not mad.If Bethesda added  more stuff like they added in the latest update,I'll stay in the game until the very end.
---
Don't get invested in the building if you know someone will blow it up
---
The game doesn't save until you leave the Vault. I'd try to find the problem before continuing.  Put in a support ticket or see if you can find some help here:  https://bethesda.net/community/category/265/fallout-76-xbox-one?language%5B%5D=en
---
People not praising fast travel inside locations
---
FYI you can't catch them.  Have tried many times.
---
I haven't tried the event yet. I'll try it. If I get a rare mask I'll post a video of it, and then try to scrap it. Or leave it in a paper bag in a toxic lake.
---
Doing it for the real bad karma since bethesda took it out of fallout :P
---
Explain to me how.
---
When a player shoots me when they mean to wave.
---
"What's wrong with your hands? Are they mangled? Or are you just button-mashing a controller with your snauze?"
---
you should post on f076filthycasuals
---
Isn't that kinda the whole point of a camp though? Like it's your little oasis in the wasteland, you decorate it and find plans and build things and go on subreddits like this to show it off to people.
---
Im down
---
I imagine if you do, and they record, you could get banned if it happens enough. If it's no longer a game mechanic, and you use alternate methods around it, Bethesda may intervene.
---
That's what PvP servers are for. But I imagine you won't do it there, because you probably like to attack people who are defenseless. So you don't get wrecked. Too tough.
---
I just keep their names on the list. Maybe this week, maybe next, I'll wreck all your shit and leave.
---
I built mine just north of town. Got a nice covered bridge over the water leading to the house, small farm down by the stream... I want the vending machines so badly. I made a new character with this last update with that in mind, hoarding all the masks and plans and legendaries people drop. 
---
I still havent seen the reactive plates on ps4 
---
I'll join. I'll craft up some 5 mm and meet you down there
---
Well youre toxic, enjoy survival mode. 
---
after the nukashine quest I've made my character into a booze seller,with a farm and everything!
---
I tried but so far world full
---
FYI here is good also. just giving info.
---
I learned something here today ..
---
I use a Sonos system to play Fallout playlists covering everything from FO3, FONV, FO4, and songs similar to the genre.  Is awesome
---
The game costs like 2.99 now, I think I'll take the ban and buy a new game if it means I can have fun
---
Hahaha yup, didn‚Äôt realize it till now 
---
Yeah, because it's not new anymore.
---
Don't be such a prick to everyone, thats an even better idea princess.
---
Yea and raiders are known for leaving settlements alone aren't they
---
Put me in coach. Gt same as here. 
---
Thank you! Currently my username is 1572153C8BB140BFA387 but I have a support ticket in to change it to FoFoJoe.
---
No idea how my username was set to that mess..
---
Wanna fight m8?
---
Sorry bro, raiders gonna raid
---
I shall
---
Not to mention it would add more active factions to the wasteland
---
You can mod your radio if you're on PC.  I modded Appalachia Radio about 2 weeks after release.  I'm not going to release it publicly because it contains copyrighted tracks.  But I will explain how it works.  Note that this is not the same as adding a new station, it simply exchanges one track for another of your choice.
---
Basically, it's the same as modding the radio for FO3, FONV, and FO4, but with one catch.  The songs have to be the same length as the ones on Appalachia Radio.  (This is to maintain server sync so that everyone hears the same song at the same time).  
---
You extract the radio tracks from *SeventySix - Sounds01.ba2* in the game's Data folder.  The tool you need for this is Archive2, which comes with the FO4 Creation Kit.  While browsing the .ba2 you'll notice all kinds of stuff left over from FO4 and question why it's even in there.  But never mind that shit.  Find the radio tracks and extract them.  They will be in the .xwm audio format.  
---
Open the extracted radio files in Multi XWM which is a tool you can get from Nexus.  Convert them to WAV or MP3 with that tool.  Open the converted files you want to replace in a sound editor, like Audacity (although I used Goldwave because I'm old school).  Find a track that you want use as a replacement.  It must be approximately the same length. Open it in the sound editor, then Copy/Paste the new track over the old one. You can go a little shorter if necessary and just add in some silence at the beginning or end of the track. 
---
Then you basically reverse the process - open the modified files in Multi XWM, save them back out to .xwm format, and then you can run them as loose mod files if you want, or do what I do - use Baka File Tool to pack the tracks in with the handful of other QOL mods I use.  
---
It's super easy, just try it.  It takes like 30 minutes to an hour, but once it's done, you'll never have to listen to the Beach Boys or Butcher Pete or Nobody's Fault But Mine again.  Think about how much time you're playing this game and I think you'll probably come to the same conclusion that I did - the time it takes is a drop in the bucket compared to the time you play.  
---
I made a mix of songs from FO3, FONV, FO4, and FO76 for my custom radio.  Plus a couple of lore-friendly picks of my own choosing.  MUCH better listening experience.  
---
You could also do the same with Classical Radio and the tracks from the Jukebox CAMP object, but I haven't gotten around to those yet.
---
Hope this helps someone.
---
Why bother? You could probably buy a couple bottles of water for that amount. Poor them out infront of homeless person on the street. Wouldn't that be suffice for someone like you?
---
Gotcha. Didn't realize they were using Amazon. There have been times it was my connection as everything ran like ass only to find resetting the WiFi connection worked like a charm for me. Thanks for the insight.
---
If you assume that the drop rate is .03%, the odds of failing (once) is 99.97% (or .9997)  For 2 attempts, it's .9997^2. for 3 tries it's .9997^3, etc.
---
So under those assumptions, .9997^3000 (3000 tries) = .4065, or 40% chance of failure (therefor a bit less than 60% chance of success).
---
Were you at low hp when you checked?
---
why was this "Removed"? :l
---
No because homeless people aren't people behind a keyboard and actually need help
---
the whole game needs a quest line and more activity
---
apparently? whats yr source?
---
Been there done that. üò¨
---
I love when I get a neighbor and they come over to my camp and explore and after exploring, invite me to their camp. üíñ
---
Upon arrival all seems well (and here comes the bit I hate) until they lock me in a room, knowing full well that picking that lock will have ‚Äòissues‚Äô.  Hahahaha, you think you‚Äôre making friends but all the time they are watching you‚Äôre every move so they can spring their trap. 
---
Or!!
---
Someone invites you to their camp after what seems like some pleasant interaction. Gets you inside, locks all the doors and then proceeds to force you to trade by spamming the trade emote and repeatedly slapping you. For giggles, I open the trade screen and the other guy ‚Äòrequests‚Äô all my shotgun ammo and disease cures. I refuse. Get slapped some more... Feels like a mugging. Fun times!
---
:::trust issues proc::: üò±
---
although I do admit it fucked up on the first impression,it's improved!It's become worth the 80$ I spent on it
---
I honestly think their damage output should correlate to the percentage of their own bounty they can afford. An attacker with 0 caps does 0 damage to other players and their camps. An attacker with a 50 cap bounty who only has 25 caps would only do 50% damage, and so on. 
---
Are you on Xbox? I'd like to hook you up with whatever mats I can spare to help you out. People are assholes, sorry you had this experience
---
Omg... This!! 
---
Maybe that's why songs from 100 to 150 years old were so popular during the war. A ton of royalty-free songs hit the market ten years ago, and there are always a few new songs on the charts in the same style as the old ones.
---
Damn. Ive been waiting in the queue for awhile lol still hanging out in it
---
U got the old man winter mask didnt u üòè
---
Maybe even DC! Who knows at this rate
---
I just got the recipe from the event so I won't need to trade anymore, but thank you for replying and offering to trade.
---
Tried to add you, didnt work.
---
I really wish they had legendary SB. Everything else in the game comes this way ( I killed a legendary rabbit yesterday). It‚Äôd make going SB hunting worthwhile 
---
So you want to attack them with only reward no risk? That's pretty lame, guy bested you(no matter how annoying melee builds are) so he should get something for it. I mean you literally have the upper hand if he was wanted, and couldn't land 10 shots with a melee build getting to you? That's in you man
---
Dang you are already at the end of the game and level 36???
---
Theres definitely a market of 30-50 caps each. Queen fighters gobble them up for the TSE Gatling Prime Lasers for example. One fight can burn 3-5 cores PLUS what you use in PA. Everyone that says they're useless, keep in mind that when you were level 20 you had next to 0 use for circuits and now burn them in silos.
---
I was there at 26 
---
I figured this was a common thing üòÇ I‚Äôve got a video of a protection turning into a 2* right in front of me from like a month ago.
---
I hope your day gets better.
---
presure plates (or keypads)with powered doors close behind you.

Sent request to FoFoJoe

Wait, I posted that wrong. I hate how I loose an extra amount of caps, say he had 25 bounty, he Lille's me and I loose an extra 25

Good ethics. Like the guy who kicks a dog comparing himself to someone who kills them.

I did this today twice, no damage on any robots and still got common masks. I‚Äôd be willing to try again later though if you want. My GT is Glant17
---
Kills
---
I'm going to move my mule to outside the bunker today and stockpile as many as I can find each day, then move it to the drop off point and hand them in one at a time...
---
No prob
---
Untrue I tanned an event while still guarding all bots from damage nobody in the pool got any rare drop 
---
This thread is dead, but the mega sloth at the Fastnacht day event drops them almost every time
---
More like you're scared the homeless guy who is actually in front of you and not behind a screen miles away from you might punch your stupid face in.
---
I don't even understand that comment. If it was an attempt at humour it wasn't funny.
---
It does when you are wearing power armor. I was in that Palace place and I was getting rain on my screen when I was indoors. 
---
There is a YTer called Miz Tracey who has very recently posted a video on how to tame creatures and where to find tameable ‚Äòpets‚Äô, as you can‚Äôt just tame anything just anywhere. 
---
Holy shit that would be awesome!
---
It's not damage based. Ran a parade with no damage and got the same masks as I did when we lost one robot or most took damage. 
---
You're not yourself when you're hungry.. why wait? Grab a snickers!
---
U obviously didnt get it üòÇüòÇ
---
Having played a lot of 4 it's so weird hearing a different "we found out" song
---
So killing a person in a game who more than likely has a real house, real food and real cleaning utensals outside the game is the same as making a person who has nothing life even worse? Now that's fucked up
---
I don't think it matters at this point, they already deleted my post. But I'll keep that in mind. Maybe I'll just do a video of everything in the house and scan by everything once it's all cleaned up.
---
Nea it's just I actually like homeless people
---
Or maybe it just wasn't funny? That's always a possibility.
---
There was no nuke site on golf club for a long time on ps4. I guess i must take care of it soon. 111 right now, and my idea of lvl is simpleee Whitesprings -&gt; Glowing Deathclaw cave -&gt; South East zone with Scorchers. If you keep one of them alive for long he will keep spawning lvl 40-70 Scorched ..and those are going down for 1 hit ....easy and fast .... with enough luck at my lvl im doing 1 lvl in less than 30 min
---
I'll keep that in mind. 
---
I'm in
---
Ok thanks
---
Put your camp on a junk pile if you find one and put and extractor on it. 
---
Drugs are crazy shit. 
---
I have the radio on at my camp so if anyone is out and about they find my work benches and bed if they need to rest up or repair something. Its also nice to have it on to chill to when I'm working on weapons or armor.
---
Let me put it this way: that‚Äôs not the only challenge, certainly not the biggest, and the effort isn‚Äôt worth it.
---
It hasn't happened in awhile, probably because you can server hop to fix it, but I hated it when people would start wrecking my camp because they had built in the same area on another server and had gotten their camp blueprinted as a result.  
---
Regarding the doors being left open, I ended up using powered doors for the ground and balcony exits.  The ground exit has a keypad, though the wall is backwards to fix the wonky keypad issue.  There's a pressure plate that opens the bottom door automatically, and the roof door is on a switch.  There's a stash box, free water (both pure and dirty), a cooking station, a tinker bench, free crops, and even a brewing station outside.  If I'm feeling like I want to allow "cribs" tours, I can just lock the doors 'open' using my terminal.
---
This happend to my X01 powerarmor helmet when I was wearing a mask.
---
Not the same. Just different levels evil. Whether you revel in the unhappiness of your peers or someone more in need than you, it doesn't matter. It stills make you a douchebag.
---
Are you ever going to update the Marine and Robot helmets? I cant mod either robot or marine helmet.
---
Not launched yet
---
Did you ever get this sorted? It just happened to me about an hour ago. My bloodied powerfist with swing speed ans +1 STR has vanished while i was playing. Not in weapon wheel after i tried to ready up and only my fists appeared. Looked in inventory and it has gone. Not in stash or any of my other characters.
---
Here‚Äôs a radical thought.
---
Don‚Äôt feed dem trolls. Precious. 
---
Some combination of stupidity with mines, scorchbeasts, and oddly overwhelming robots.
---
I've tried it with 2 people, apparently it resets even if someones up tyere to keep the robots from getting to the terminal anyways.
---
Yea I'll take being an online douchebag over a street doucebag 
---
Rains inside my camp all the camp.  My camp is tents.
---
What platform?  Also you can get the plans to build it yourself in Taggerdy‚Äôs computer at the top of fort defiance... just a heads up
---
That's actually a really great idea.
---
can some1 invite me? just got disconnected. GT: Exqlus1ve

---
You can't. He started shooting at me after the parade ended.
---
I did too. Maybe server quit
---
Ps4
---
Lost mine too, it‚Äôs in my inventory but is invisible when I deploy it.... hopefully it‚Äôs fixed soon. 
---
get your bounty up to like 500 caps. people's gonna team up.
---
wheres my dense at?
---
I hate it when people fast travel out of my trap base. JUST PUT THE LOTION ON THE SKIN GAWDAMAT.
---
If you're on ps4 I got a lvl 35 two-shot Gatling gun I can pass your way, dunno about finding level 20 ones though
---
Then they should really look into it, honestly.
---
No mine disappeared from the game 
---
Yes and you can make overcharged cores with higher int. Keep meaning to experiment with this, I've managed to make 120% cores so far.
---
You can get the plans for free from Fort Defiance
---
Mine disappeared from the game
---
Just saw you were in PC, good luck though man!
---
If you got it that means you can go into to room with the terminal. terminal holds the plans. you can rebuild it.
---
Thank you
---
"blows ram stick" thnx I needed a good chuckle.
---
sturdy and heavy are extremely hard to find. pretty sure light is sold at vendors though
---
Quit looking for a shortcut
---
Thanks for the info
---
After watching that I not only still don't get it, my mood has decreased thoroughly.
---
Wholeheartedly agree.  I think almost everyone accidentally droped or scrapped something they regret.  For me it was my favorite gatling gun.  So shocked when I couldn't find it in my inventory as it's usually one of my default weapons.  Locking down weapons and armor are essential.
---
This is true - you can move your CAMP using the Pip-Boy just a little bit, pay the Caps, and have everything fixed.
---
However, depending on the complexity of your CAMP (specifically, the number of foundations you use), you may not be able to physically place it again.  That's why you see so many "floating" CAMPs based on a single foundation.   As long as you can place that one foundation, you're golden.  Worst comes to worst, you can scrap your CAMP's blueprint for its constituent parts and rebuild it using those.  At least you won't have to expend resources remaking the crafting tables, generators, etc.
---
Why a pm? Wouldn‚Äôt it easier to just post it?
---
Sounds about right. üòÇüòÇ
---
In the paladins room with the laser grid at defiance, use the computer and it will give you the plans to create it. 
---
Idk but I would guess somewhere in toxic valley.
---
I used this link to find the exact boundaries https://game-maps.com/Fallout-76/img/Toxic-Valley-Fallout-76-Map.jpg
---
And this to spot plan spawn locations. https://www.falloutmaps.com/#!/
---
It's not perfect, they dont show the armor mod spawn at the penitentiary. But I'm pretty sure that the individual points are pretty limited (this is backed up by my experience server hopping at the railcar in Watoga) so I wouldn't expect to find dense where you find Ultralight.  But I could be wrong. If dense is the same tier of rarity as deep pocketed and ultralight checking Grafton steel couldn't hurt. You spawn about a 1 minute sprint from the spawn.
---
What system are you on?
---
Because I really want to watch you kill your character over and over again with plasma grenades.  Sounds like great fun to witness!
---
Already said it on twitter but there was no answer (not like i expect any here but..)
---
1. WE CANT SEE OTHER PLAYERS AT MAP WHEN WE DO SURVIVAL MOD and no TELEPORTATION! I hope we all want SURVIVAL instead of Battle Royal Mode !  Every encounter with human should be a surprise instead of just getting gank by a gang of dozen prepared enemies teleporting to you 
---
2. We need more types of weapons instead of quests. As a streamer i must say finding new "toy" to play is much funnier, especially when it can be upg, instead of 2-3 hour questline...
---
3. Ehhh i wish monsters would scale to your level like in you old games, i guess its impossibru now so i just go back to hunt zombies with my hammer.. (GIMME MORE WEAPONS!)
---
Love ya guys, u doing great job with those updates! Too bad i never heard back from you about anything i wrote at twitter... but i guess u guys got smarter people in your team :)
---
Bearded\_DooD
---
I am on PS4, I will take your advice and play a bit more
---
You must think your joke's absolutely hilarious, but I don't think anybody could understand it. What the hell does the Snow Miser song have to do with the Old Man Winter mask, and what does the Old Man Winter mask have to do with a bug ruining my CAMP?
---
Also faction based flags, decorations, building sets etc. 
---
Would love to fly the Brotherhood of Steel flag above my base!
---
We all need a way to vent and other peoples CAMPs are a great way to take out any grievances that were grating on me.
---
&gt;That's where I CAMP, across the pond from the shack by where the stream feeds it. Since the update made it possible to use more turrets I zone in to the sound of machine guns and a rocket launcher fairly routinely.The dusky and glowing tear through barricades pretty fast and, sometimes they 3-shot me before I can finish them off....pretty well set for springs and acid now, though.
---
pretty sure its just a mistake in the AI that madde it look smarter
---
Y'know, I've often wondered about usernames like that.  Never knew it was a bug.
---
True. You have to copy the Playlist, download the others from YT and then add em to your copy 
---
Ps1? Mate, tell me where you got your godly ps1 I went one lol
---
Many people have already told
---
Me this read
---
People that steal your kills
---
I'm on Xbox, GT Royal Octo, I'll wait by the Blackwater Mind for mercy killings &lt;3
---
I'll remember to do that from now on
---
Or, just don't be a douchebag in general. Invest your time in actually being good at something, rather than being jealous of people who are better than you. Because I'm sure you're more salty than the dead sea when things don't go your way. 
---
But, each to their own. 
---
Its more about attitude and demeanor. Take in the similarities. 
---
heatmiser.
---
Sorry that happened to you, the only reason to destroy a CAMP is if they are on the green at Whitesprings with turrets. In that case, light them the hell up. 
---
Based on my observations, it's more rare than the masks.  I have *almost* every CAMP plan, the two recipes, and at least two of each common mask.  I only have one beret.
---
_wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if we could live together in a world where we can get along_
---
Or... hear me out, you do you. me do me
---
Snow Miser seems like a very chipper person.
---
I'm salty as shit
---
I'm... Mr. Salt Miser, I'm mister rage. Everything that I touch turns to salt in my clutch.
---
I don't see the similarities.
---
No, the point of the C.A.M.P. was never to show it off to people on Reddit.  In-game, sure.  Where a possible interaction includes damage to your C.A.M.P. and to you.
---
Stop crying about losing. Get better. 
---
Kill him. 
---
One of my favorite shows, for sure.
---
Happy for you!
---
Aye a fellow raider, nice to meetcha
---

---
I was hoping to get the answer here, but no :¬¥( It says "Land a sneak attack" whilst on Old Possum.
---
I have tried shooting with x2 and hitting with x2. Nothing. Critical doesn't do it either.
---
I just need anothe level in armored and I can mak dense chest
---
Here it is:
---

---
I want to role play as Jigsaw and put people in my traps.
---
Nah, it's still just gone, probably because Bethesda is completely incompetent and shipped a product that doesn't work properly.
---
But hey I'm already out 80 bucks like a chump, what can I do?
---
would that kill the robots also?
---
What melees?
---
I went to make the chest, but the game gave me the whole set.
---
Its so sad that kids these days dont watch the Rudolf claymation movies.
---
I guess u won‚Äôt get it. üò¨ 
---
I think it is because I never entered a username, when I registered I put in my email and password and bam got that hideous name.
---
Would've been too tempting if I were on my raider character. Do the first half, make them a mini house with workbench, then orbital strike then whilst they're locked inside, followed by a mini nuke to be sure. THEN the faschnacht day v2 would begin
---
They haven't exactly aged well if we're being honest.
---
Lol not even gonna lie, my son in 13 and he‚Äôs HUGE into comics, DC and Marvel lol he schooled me to üòÇ
---
Was just gonna mention that door. When I first saw it I immediately thought of a dungeon entrance. Would be a great way to introduce space themed loot.
---
Farm the fasnacht event, easily got 1-2k caps and a few levels his from trying to get the rare masks 
---
Dense is the rarest. I need like 5 more armor mod plans in total and 4 of them are dense. They might only drop from quests idk really.
---
I'm sure they know a lot of players are curious as to why they would make these masks so rare that only one in a million players would get one. It must be bugged. 
---
I just read a post about excitement for future events like halloween. I wouldn't even bother with these events if they promise any rare items again. If there is almost no chance after 20+ hours of anyone getting mask what's the point of grinding these events for rare items? I'll never find one being sold for caps, but thousands of real world dollars f'off. I think I was like my 15th fasnacht when I was like this is strange I have duplicates of all the other stuff and no one else in the event has one.
---
So after hours of playing I went on reddit and everyone is say it's so rare you will never get one. I played fasnacht for maybe 10 more hours to prove them wrong just like I did when I bought the collectors edition when everyone online was saying how bad this game was.
---
The collectors edition was so rare it was being sold on eBay for thousands of dollars and out of reach for FO fans and now fasnacht. When will it stop?
---
No legendary robots always explode
---
where have you been man.  its been like this since the beta.  although it seems now they insta explode when they die instead of a delay like they used to
---
No, all additional projectiles as in pellets from a shotty or pulling the trigger again only refreshes the suppressors effect
---
Very nice, since im melee right now, usually all my ammo is going to low lvl chars that i can find on the map, same as end game weapons i dont need. Dont rly care if they destroy them, its nice to share stuff with newbies. Community at ps4 is rly nice :)
---
Calm down, he's not going to people's real houses and destroying them.  It's a video game. 
---
Most of the god-guys I know can't wait for survival and refuse to continue participating in an environment where you can't shoot a rude guy as they are protected under slap damage. I'm myself a murder build and I rarely attack other players (I mean, I might slap you once, but only once as a "lets dance" invitation), I prefer to defend myself or to fight willing participants (i.e. a team with a bounty player luring people). I farm my own stuff and trade for what I use more than I produce. I'm not planning to kill-on-sight every player I meet. I'm okay with loosing some caps if my 'hello' is met with gunfire, I'll be hunting such people until they leave the server. I'm disinterested in fighting people that don't know how to shoot back effectively.
---
I‚Äôm taking a large leap and assuming those locked keypad cabins will be player housing, so if players have dedicated housing they don‚Äôt want camps nearby. Possible safe zone:/load in houses 
---
For some reason me Grandma's voice just popped into my head saying "that's nice honey"...
---
I think stuff is priced fairly reasonably.. I've got 4500 saved up atm, and that's after I've bought over 1k worth of stuff in the store already(500 for Lever action skin, couple 80 atom outfits on sale and a camp decoration)...and I've earned all those atoms. I generally stick to buying stuff I like on "sale" or the odd limited time item, like the Whitespring floors. 
---
Thx for this! Glad i didn‚Äôt start the crafting/scrapping procedure for mods.
---
Boom
---
and thats my build for solo. can 2h-melee and rifles at once. For powerarmor.
---

---
That's not a bad theory, though my camp was so far away that I doubt I'd have been much of a hassle to anyone in there. Oh well, at least it's a possible explanation.
---
twas a humor
---
Use vats to target them. If you have spare points the camera will follow them of a very short time. 
---
That's more what I mean. I hit them and it's an immediate explosion
---
We have a massive prison that doesn‚Äôt get used enough.  Allow us to travel there and pay off the bounty. 
---
Try fasnacht, but don't bother grinding it for any rare stuff, but if you do get one of these mythical masks dude awesome! I would be so happy to see someone get one.
---
Appreciate u not lying
---
Thank you! üòÖ
---
Only got to do the event once before leaving on vacation without my Xbox. Go it in that one run. I was mad I didn‚Äôt get a mask lol, maybe I‚Äôm luckier than I thought
---
Same, there's honestly not much in the Atom store I actually really want right now...but something like this, could make me part ways with some of them. I'd also be more inclined to buy weapon skins if they were for more than 1 weapon. Make a package "theme" for commonly used/popular weapons (handmade, Lever action, 10mm, combat rifle and hunting rifle) and sell it for like 1k atoms
---
What does the name Wild Wasteland have anything to do with a space station? I'm curious. 
---
They didnt. They used an automated system to scan for anyone who had gained over a total of 100,000 items regardless of how many were held at one time. If you made 10,000 ultracite ammo on 10 different occasions then you were banned.
---
That‚Äôs my point. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with the actual Atom prices of items. Atoms are pretty easy to earn through normal gameplay.
---
People saying Atom Shop prices are unfair are looking at the prices of Atoms and the prices of items. The flawed element in that situation would be the price of the Atoms themselves, not the price of the item.
---
I see this variations on this comment a lot.  Two things:  first, online games usually have issues at launch.  Fallout really suffered a hit from this since it was normally not an online game.  Wow, Diablo 3,and several others had severely disfunctional launches, to the point the game was unplayable for a lot of people for weeks.  Also, online games are probably a lot harder to QA fully.
---
Second, that whole developer vs greedy executives pushing a launch trope... The entire launch of a game depends on a lot of separate departments all converging.  If the developers miss a date by a week and now marketing, suppliers, distributors, servers providing bandwidth for updates and online play, all of those various contracted 3rd parties now have to adjust.  Also, I know me personally, and projects without firm deadlines can keep growing as you have more ideas and more things you want to implement or new features.  That's how games fail or fail to launch entirely.  Seriously, every failed game story has hits the same notes:  pushing back because of new features, new technology, new engines.
---
With an online game especially, eventually you have to say "This is good enough.  Launch it and we'll just fix it all later, especially since we could spend 4 years QAing the thing and find a tenth of the issues the players can find on the 1st day.  Bethesda was pretty upfront and honest about what to expect, unlike some developers.  (with the exception of the canvas bag, an issue I'm still of 2 minds about.) 
---
Say what you want but someone carried me through, I shot a load of shit and had a great time. They even let me launch the nuke.
---
Did you ever find a fix for this?
---
awesome thanks
---
That Flatwoods monster, though?
---
Lol its not.
---
After multiple tries, i honestly thought that that was the way the event would play out
---
I agree, but as is the chances are so miniscual that running it past the basic masks and plans is almost pointless.
---
See that's good info I needed to know. Thanks
---
great build btw
---
No, pacifist will just prevent you from being able to initiate/accept pvp. They will also be adding the same logic to your camp in a future update. Basically if you want to pvp at all you'll have to go to sur9mode, which is how it should be. 
---
whelp I sorted it.
---
Somehow the \[Archive\] line got lost :(
---
Added that, and everything is working.
---
OH NO THE BAND DIDN'T SHOOOOOOWWWW. 
---
I would pay money to get rid of the foundation stuff. Even in Fallout 4, I rarely built new structures and instead renovated existing ones. In 76, there's not near as many options to do this but they exist, and yet I can't even put a door or a wall up because everything has to snap together on a foundation. It's annoying AF.
---
One did show up during the event for me yesterday, after the town got nuked during the parade.  Instead of being able to collect the intestines from all of the nuked animals, we had to fight a scorchbeast.  0/10 would not recommend.
---
Server hopped and the key isn't on the rooftop of Mt Blair Trainyard
---
Wild wasteland is a perk in New Vegas and older fallout( not sure on this, I may be wrong, but its definitely in NV), where strange shits happens, and it usually involve aliens. 
---
I've turned in about 50 total(different time) and haven't gotten any paint jobs. You just super lucky lol
---
It‚Äôs not a 100% fix but it does help some. 
---
Like none really, except for gas extractors and they don't have moving parts... 
---
I have this problem on PS4 where if I'm in a group, we can only talk in Auto. The only way to talk to people not in our group is to switch to area.
---
I've never wrecked one unprovoked. One time me and some friends were looking at the Charleston event vender, took awhile to find him. We were just doing our shopping taking turns. Some level 17 jerk runs up and keeps initiating combat with the vendor preventing anyone from using it, he wouldn't fight any of the three of us, so we couldn't kill him since he just stimpacked the slap damage. And would only vats the vendor so we would never be in risk of attack.
---
We asked him to stop and why is he killing the vendor, he said "why not?" 
---
We leveled his base, and killed him twice. Through slap, he wanted to troll but would refuse to fight, hiding behind the system while being a jerk. 
---
I don't support leveling anyones base but if you do trolly stuff and refuse to fight, its the only thing other players can do.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter if he dropped them. If you drop something it‚Äôs fair game 
---
Didn‚Äôt fallout tactics take place in Texas? 
---
People not knowing how to trade
---
I think these would become the best selling stuff in the atom store because I don't really buy from there, but if radio stuff was there I totally would.
---
Yup. I was punchin‚Äô buns in watoga and a legendary just sploded, never happened to me before
---
Server disconnected - set the clocks back a bit.
---
PS4 sorry
---
in the past 3 days ive turned in over 200 data i had stored up on my alts that havent completed the bos quests yet i turned in around 75 a day i had a hunch and wanted to test my theory and the fact that i got multiple of the same paint on the same day means there has to be a rotation 
---
It's on it's own timer to repeat every hour. The servers start at different times but mostly towards the top of the hour. 
---
You are saying that Bethesda fucked your wife.
---
Once you get in the area itll walk you through it. If nothing pops up it's simply on a cooldown.
---
I have both. They seem to occur at the same frequency. 
---
Was there one that you had for longer? That no longer kicks in? Or does the most recent one not kick in? Does it really NEVER happen or just almost never? If it has never happened then maybe you have a glitch.
---
Get mutated.. shows up in pipboy... server crash... you loose the last 30 seconds of game play... mutation lost but not removed from pipboy screen... 
---
Would appear as a mutation glitch but actually be a visual pipboy glitch...
---
Just some thoughts.
---
You have to wait for the event to be active
---
It's every hour.
---
Pretty sure it doesn‚Äôt.
---
They would have to be off brand licenses and such make their own fallout twinkies
---
R/unexpectedhulk
---
Nice
---
Totally looking for Deep pocketed Metal Chest.
---
Whats good stealth armor?
---
Treasure maps
---
Bethesda forums have reports of people running the event *hundred*s of time and no one anywhere reports getting the rare masks at all.  
---
Damn, gonna have to go do that now!
---
Well you see what usually happens is when a momma assultron really loves a daddy Mr Gutsy and when they get together they can have a baby robot and sometimes that‚Äôs baby robot has an extra chromosome 21 which makes them a very special protection that is loved very much.
---
Idk about chest for metal but for combat armor you learn the chest by scrapping. And it takes a lot of scrapping.
---
I have sent text messages to players by the send message option when i select there icon, same menu where invite to join is (xbox), does this not work?
---
Any of the masks that aren't the ones you just mentioned, or the ones in the Atom Shop.
---
Give me 2,000 caps and I'll tell ya!
---
Turrets are better since last patch. Now great, but better. 
---
I have never come across sturdy or heavy metal plans. For that matter, I haven't even found light metal arms.
---
Ok guys mistery solved, in case someone still looking how to do it - 
---
1. Swamp plant indeed is a name of needed item, but it is collected from Strangler Bloom game object along with Strangler Bloom item. 
---
2 Strangler Bloom and Strangler Pod is the SAME game object, during the day it is Pod and in the night it turns in BLOOM, so dont try looking for Bloom during a day. 
---
3 If during a day Pod was collected you wont be able to gather Bloom when the night comes. 
---
4 It has several bugs with it, sometimes Bloom displayed during a day but it is impossible to collect, collected Pod's still turn to Bloom's at night but they are impossible to collect either.
---
Did this research myself, hope it help's someone.
---
My girlfriend has several mixed drink recipies that involve lead Champagne and had yet to learn the recipe for it. Driving her crazy. 
---
Melee needs a Nerf, no reason my bloodied fire axe should do 900+ damage with zero melee perks, mutations, or unyeilding armor
---
I always assumed thats what fancy lads snack cakes were.
---
I have scrapped more metal chests than you might imagine.
---
That's the really damning thing, imo.  If someone had a rare mask, I would have expected to see them wear it at some point.  Somewhere.  Anywhere.  With a good 10-12 people showing up per Fasnacht, times however hundreds of thousands of times it's been run, not a single person here has seen them in the wild and captured evidence of it.
---
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwww
---
wait..  THREE in Emergency Services!?! i gotta look more thoroughly. never saw a bobblehead ever there. 
---
Nuka World had that
---
I believe it! For what it's worth I learned Ultralight chest combat armor from scrapping arms. I can't recall if I saw chest mods here but it's definitely worth s look.
---
And im one of those people who did the event hundred times. 
---
*‚ÄùVault 76 was filled with America‚Äôs best and brightest‚Äù -Vault 76 Overseer, 2102*
---
You only get only if the resource is available at your C.A.M.P or WORKSHOP. 
---
At this point it's not even worth it. I love cosmetics, but it's not worth the grind to get with a drop rate that low. The cost investment is just not worth it.
---
Yessss. Anti-Material rifle please......
---
Wow, hopefully they can make it right.
---
Or, you know, do a sensible thing like display character names instead of Bethesda account names.
---
I'll take 5 please. Mammouthu add me
---
If you have done in the radius of your CAMP or Workshop, you'll just magically have the ability to place it.
---
Yeaaaahh... they did me dirty with that exploding thing earlier today, lol. XD
---
Headed your way 
---
Yeah, think assultrons &amp; col gutsy's in hoards
---
No problem
---
I have my door locked for a reason, don‚Äôt try to find another way in, this has happened to mean a few times in the last few months
---
Supposedly Grahm sells it. But should be other places too, by the plan issue fuckin up
---
 Not by the people who play it!
---
There's also a cook station after u pass the bee House (red barn) 
---
Oh and the rifleman perks are for when your low on ammo.
---
I think we are gonna get that on April ninth for sheer terror along with that door in the enclave bunker opening
---
It's every hour based upon the start of the previous iteration.  There is a server-wide event prompt that shows up, much like Scorched Earth, although it's easy to miss.  Just keep an eye on Helvetia itself.  If you see a bunch of players clumped there, but no event, you can assume it ended recently.  If no one is there, you might expect it to happen in a few minutes.
---
Agreed. With the exception of turret farms . 
---
I'll blow those up all day. 
---
Aww you didn't get the rare thing? Maybe next time, bud.
---
My assumption is that it's gonna be more like arenas or battlegrounds from mmos. If that is the case, it'd be absurd if you had to start over. I really do hope they have a good reason for making this decision
---
O
---
T
---
W
---
Post the GT pls. 
---
It‚Äôs a beta man just have fun and submit your feedback directly to Bethesda. 
---
I hope they keep it this way but also make a separate mode with no legendaries or you can only have a couple, that way the truly hardcore people and the casuals who just wanna pvp can both have fun and stop complaining.
---
Build your CAMP around a junk pile node or workshop with a junk pile in it. There's one in a scrapyard east of 76 and another southwest of Charleston by the power plant with several junk piles. 
---
Except for the guy that built over the creek and made it difficult to gather eggs.
---
I‚Äôm queued up, fingers crossed for a stable server this time 
---
Totally agree with you there.  I have OCD very badly and have to shut every door I go through in the game.  I hate when I return to my base and the front door has been left open by some boob. What bothers me the most though is when people leave the door to the Nuka Cola machines open after looting them.(mainly the one in the Enclave bunker at Whitesprings)  annoys the crap out of me, can literally feel my turds moving out of my ass when this happens.
---
I thought about suggesting a third mode, which could work. But I felt like it might separate the player base too much. But who knows. Not complaining, I'm going to play it either way, just think it'd be much better if it was separate.
---
The real question is...have you given up?
---
Strip naked and wait at a public area, like the entrance to the Vault or a train station.
---
No, really.  I'm serious.  Being naked shows you don't have any weird armor tricks up your sleeve, and so long as you aren't near anyone else, people will get the hint.
---
Wait for it or server hop. It'll start eventually.
---
I kind of like to wander around town while I wait. Pop balloons. Play music. Kill beasties. Say hi to the neighbors. Maybe walk down to the train station and back again.
---
I mean it seems so. Everyone has pretty much given up with no way to get the masks effectively. 
---
It was probably from a nearby fissure site. Probably not scripted.
---
Then apparently they broke something else because I got it on the first try.
---
Well it doesn‚Äôt happen to me,so seems the fault is on your system somewhere.
---
There's wood outside the white shed where the weapons workbench is. Also in the red barn at the back where the cook station is there is a big stack there. I believe there is a los wood at the back of the bee shed
---
I like to do this from Chameleon 
---
Thanks. I thought mine was by a junk pile but apparently not. 
---
You can‚Äôt base the result on a single try; you‚Äôd have to replicate those conditions for 1,000s or tries before we‚Äôll know if it made a difference.
---
Do it quick. Sell it to the vendors or give it players and then leave the server. Give back to RNJesus and he will returneth unto you gifts of TSEs.
---
Maybe the end of the event, will be more generous with us?
---
My biggest gripe is just give it a shot. Bethesda already said they‚Äôre making some balance changes and if you play smart I think you‚Äôll be able to take out anybody regardless of gear.
---
Hmmm. I guess not. I can‚Äôt loot from it. So if you can loot from it it‚Äôs a junk pile?
---
It really doesn‚Äôt seem you can hurt anything but the bad guys and yourself in this mission, I‚Äôve screwed up a lot and only have ever hurt myself 
---
I think I have an extra if you want it :)
---
mosey on over to r/fo76filthycasuals
---
Well no one od the 12 to 14 people parading with us got a rare mask either. I know you need a bigger sampling pool for accurate results but no one on the entirety of this reddit, in probably thousands of combined runs, has gotten one. 
---
They tend to go with pop songs of the day but jazz definitely had some memorable sub genres that would work well with Fallout, mondo exotica stuff, early big band, lots of Latin styles too.
---
https://fo76map.com/ is a handy resource when looking for nodes to place your camp around.
---
You do realize moving your camp costs 40 on top of the fast travel cost to the location from your current camp, right?
---
Join events to earn xp, armor, plans- yellow map icons on map. Earn 1400 caps everyday pick heaps corn razorgrain at Billings Homestead to sell at 6 different vendors on map. The 7th vendor requires you to be an enclave general.
---
Slightly amused that you only destroy the door, and then proceed to just take a nap lmao
---
When will you be able to get them
---
Well think about this lore wise; The radio is a repeat transmission so there would be no one monitoring it and putting more songs on the radio. But if it wasn‚Äôt a repeat signal, I would totally agree with you. 
---
ive played the game just fine for months.  the bugs ive encountered were annoying but not game breaking.  not being able to craft ammo is gamebreaking as a rifle build
---
FYI you can press right on some items to see other variants.  not sure if that's one of them.  hope it helps
---
I got an extra set of the recipes if you want them, cut out the middle lemonade vendor bot 
---
I know I just didn‚Äôt see any but Idk...
---
My ‚Äúlearn weapons plans‚Äù challenge is at 75/76 and I have about a dozen more from the master list.
---
There is nowhere in the map that costs 120 caps to fast travel. This is a glitch that has been around since beta.
---
My CAMP was moving approximately twenty feet, sweetums.
---
The fast travel cost would have been free.
---
And that's not explained anywhere in the game either, so even if that _was_ the cause, your condescending-ass comment would still have little relevance, snookums.
---
I fight every SB I come across now. Doesn't take up too much resources but they drop rubbish.
---
I paid 40c today because i decided to bulldoze my house on the exact same patch of dirt. Because I'm max build, i ended up misplacing the camp and didnt like my circle. The next move after paying the initial 40c was 160c for 10 feet. Nothing built, just moving the camp pack 10 feet. No fast travel.
---
Then add a questions to find an old radio station and activate it or add songs as random loot that can be brought to a station and added to a playlist. You could even make this part of one of the vault questioned for when those vaults finally get opened.
---
Can't you just fast travel away?
---
The problem isn‚Äôt the duped items. It‚Äôs the imaginary caps it created. 
---
Barring and civil war mass produced clothing. And legendary item farming and selling. How many people really earned their caps? How many are boarder line money/cap laundering at this point?
---
How do you get a deathclaw?
---
Sure
---
A google search says it took place in the midwest close to Chicago. I never played so I am not sure. 
---
I have my house completely open, except for one empty room. People really try to break into that room.
---
They're also adding the "Shear Terror" new quest(s)/cryptid(s) on April 9th. It seems like one bigger update every month and a few smaller one in the weeks between. I'm ok with this.
---
How much?
---
4th of July is hopefully very fallout-y
---
I think so.
---
I've run the event enough times to get pretty much everything else, except for one of the hanging ribbons, so I'm good.  A bit disappointed in Bethesda's "No, really, it's in the game, you just aren't trying hard enough" responses though.  We might actually conclude that these rare masks may be the rarest thing in the whole game, by quite some magnitude.
---
I looked it up, and this problem has persisted since launch.
---
With how often I'm making these salty posts, people are gonna think I hate the game/Bethesda. But I'm just cranky that glitches like _these_ have existed without attention for _months_
---
How many characters can you have on one account?
---
What‚Äôs so interesting about a locked room in a camp? Are we hiding our own version of Fort Knox or Area 51? Lol
---
actualy if they chose to attack back you get the bounty + the normal pvp caps.
---
this is the only one we havent seen picture proof of I thinks :(
---
Ohhhh, yeah there‚Äôs a fallout event in. It‚Äôs probably in your best interest not to find out XD
---
dropping stuff for people, proceeding to crouch next to the back and point at is, sometimes even shoot at it, and them just super obviously carrying on
---
Yeah now I killed them and then spam the loot button
---
I was told 4 but I haven‚Äôt checked. 
---
random encounter and maxed animal friend. 
---
I hate the move cost when the destination is within the same cell. It should not be 40 if you realize you have to reposition because the  terrain is inadequate, or uncooperative.  Move cost should be relative to distance just like fast travel costs.
---
BIG IRON
---
Damn I really like swinging on star :/
---
They have already talked about this particular issue.
---
Thing is, unfortunately for you, they didn't say what you wanted to hear.
---
As a level 15 I can tank a hit from a level 300 if we‚Äôre not in combat, not meant to be possible to one hit someone you didn‚Äôt hit back
---
So you can have a max of 100,000 caps at one time, that‚Äôs still a ton but any player can achieve that not thru duping. Trust me I hate duping but barring mass numbers of nuka colas no one has unlimited caps 
---
Eh kinda of a dick move but I'm glad that people are using pvp system and you should make your charter have raider amour when you wreck homes to add to the whole Rose recruiting raiders thing going on in the quest line.
---
Yeah im not too clued up on the sub genres of Jazz of that era , i knew it was out there,,, if they hired a band to play some music im sure some niche bands may jump at the chance of recognition in a video game It would make a great alternative Radio station , more music the merrier,, i also think a wasteland talk show could be funny too if they got Karl Pilkington or somebody to host it
---
Awesome I must have misread the road map I thought it was coming after the new vendor
---
Technically there IS a Fallout game in Texas... We just dare not speak of it.
---
What‚Äôs your level?
---
id love one on ps4.. can have all my duplicate plans
---
Free my man
---
I can confirm that other players killing your brahmin does not make them wanted
---
35
---
Yup. They get some serious air time too.
---
https://youtu.be/XIbzATPrZY8
---
Cool, I'll take it off your hands 
---
He was claiming my workshop, could it be the reason??
---
It sucks, players are only concerned with the sloth now. The focus should be keeping the fucking robots at full health. Personally I think everyone has to be drunk but I'll never get to test it 
---
If I had a full enclave group I could claim to be "cleansing" the wasteland, but yea raider armour can work for now
---
I would like to be able to get plans for the robots for my C.A.M.P. Then you could listen to their fun remarks, and singing. I would like to be able to play the funny parade music in the camp.
---
Way less people doing the event at this point. I did one by myself, barely succeeding, today. Now it's only about 5 people per event.
---
I've been playing with the brahmin pen a lot lately and can confirm that other players killing your brahmin has no repercussions for them. Same thing happens if they kill your tamed pet, they do not acquire a bounty.
---
I'm on the New Gad side heading out of town just past the bridge out.. made an Old Possum bar.. come check it out sometime. On XB1
---
Got a explosive mutated black powder rifle on PS4 for sale for 3k
---
I couldn't agree more. 160c for 30~ feet is unfair. But even without the bug, 40c for that distance is ridiculous.
---
Nope I was in the trade screen and also typing a message to the guy on the Xbox app. That‚Äôs the part I‚Äôm most confused about 
---
Once I started using Power Armor and a melee weapon I found they aren‚Äôt too difficult. That said it‚Äôs a lot of work for very little reward. They could at least drop legendaries. 
---
Songs like this are usually licensed for nothing, so whoever owns its rights currently is probably just getting whatever the lowest rate might be for 5-10 years of use. It might cost a lot because the licenses might be bulked together in tiers?
---
I‚Äôd totally buy a song pack provided it was perpetual with the life of the game.
---
We have not raining in doors in 2010 games with custom maps idk we're appreciating meeting the norm set nine years ago.
---
Are you online now? 
---
Maybe they think its a decontamination arch or like a hidden special item. I dunno, I just leave it locked for the mystery. But quite a few people have picked the level 2 lock. I left it at level 2 to increase the ability of people to try and pick it.
---
Last time I stayed on a server for 6 events I got 4 owl mask 1 napoleon and 1 witch that I all have 5+ of each already.
---
Yeah I feel like not enough people need to realize that this game isn't just pve looking at how people responded to your post because it gets boring killing ghouls with two swings of a hammer and sometimes it's fun to pick fights or wreck bases.
---
I understand downvoting some of your other comments but this thought is pure gold. 
---
perfectly normal. with the right build, you can 1 shot him too. Well maybe not since you are like level 60. but 1shotting people is nothing new in this game and that's why people are skeptical when it comes to new survival mode. Bethesda is aware and said they are trying to fix this
---
I‚Äôll sign on real quick. What are you looking for?
---
I enjoy the confused reactions from the C.A.M.P. owners.
---
2,100 caps
---
I don‚Äôt have 3k but I have 2k
---
If you had a workshop you are automatically put into PVP. You don't need to retaliate for them to attack you for full damage. There is no slap damage once you own a workshop. 
---
I spend a lot of time messing with the C.A.M.P. system and there is a bunch of stuff that doesn't have any use in the power connectors like the interval counters and the sound speakers. I'm assuming there is a pile of missing power related C.A.M.P. items like an interval generator or more complex power connector objects that let you build more complicated things but you can't use them right now.
---
They feel less like an opportunity and more like a resource dump.
---
isnt there a bench in one of the buildings?
---
Yeah it really sucks I was dying to get the jester but I guess I‚Äôll never see it. Pretty shitty in my opinion I get that the event is free but wtf? Bethesda hasn‚Äôt said anything, besides a dumbass response that‚Äôs not good enough. You‚Äôd think they see the thousands of people saying ‚Äúwell events almost over and no rare mask‚Äù lol pathetic IMO. 
---
I feel so bad as i saw it thought neat and he wouldn't let me take a pic with him. It was day one so i didn't know it was rare and i play on xbox btw 
---
I didn‚Äôt say unlimited. I just saying more thought needed/needs to be made about survival. Dupers allowed to do what they did for as long as they isn‚Äôt going to be fixed with a single game mode addition. 
---
I feel that they are more like ding dongs or zebra cakes.
---
The fact that they made a perk card for Rad storms that occur once every 10 or so LEVELS and last for 45 seconds is hilarious.  
---
I was just being silly ;) 
---
As the fella above says it either was never fully addressed - despite the patch notes' assertiveness - and under unspecified circumstances they can still perform their magic trick or it came back in a subsequent patch.
---
The only beret I found was dropped by another player. Never actually received one from the event.
---
A few sneak vats crits to he face and a crippled wing and they drop like bloat flies. 
---
too bad its prob lvl 35. if im wrong HEEELLLLL FREAKING YEA
---
I get that it's not meant to be easy, but i feel like balanced encounters would make them more rewarding
---
Son I‚Äôve lubing up these robots day and night making sure they really get what they need
---
Doing Atoms work. 
---
I had hoped a dlc involving another space ship in FO4, but never came.  Mother ship Zeta was a very fun dlc in FO3
---
Oh crap never thought to look there! I‚Äôm at 67....
---
Mind making me a list of what you got for building so I can make a check list if it‚Äôs not too much to ask for?
---
Just signed on. Join me and fast travel to me. What are you looking for? 
---
hmm if it was day one he might have had it from dev room since he didnt want you to pic him. I dont know. skeetchy
---
Here‚Äôs to hoping. 
---
Mine keeps getting killed by my dang unruly super mutant neighbors. 
---
Yesterday I had the double problem of sorting them out, getting my brahmin back, and then a bunch of low level scorched attacked. Kept the brahmin alive, but then a damn Scorchbeast showed up. Fired some potshots at it for a while, kept most of my base safe from being destroyed, I THOUGHT it killed the brahmin again, but then I noticed: Pacify Scorchbeast. ANIMAL FRIEND PERK!! Hit that R button, and hallelujah, that bastard de-aggroed and flew away. First time that's ever worked on one of those for me. Happier ending, Brahmin wandered back up the hill and went back to its spot. It didn't die after all!
---
Thanks man
---
I agree
---
Honestly I think once food is cooked it should just last. There is no fridge to put food in as it would be linked to your stash, which is stupid by the way, if you have more than one box it makes no sense for them to be linked. The claim is this game is trying to replicate reality yet that is not reality. Anyway, it is a good idea either way really as we can food and it lasts years, depending on the food being canned. 
---
"a few" seems generous
---
I had to reupload to Vimeo for the full video.
---
Doubtful with that droprate.
---
Plans for each color give paint another use? 
---
It's minecraft back in 2011 all over again tbf
---
Weightless 
---
I‚Äôd head over to r/fo76bazaar :)

Long time Fallout fan and Bethesda defender here, but I gotta say: Every since the last update, when Bethesda very thoughtfully, yet moronically decided to name the turret's owner at each players camp, this has perpetuated a whole new aspect for griefing.  Now they know who you are.  Find your name, block it and commence the smashing of all you have worked for. Yes, you will get notified and IF you see it it's helpful, but if they block you before they incur the bounty, you won't see who it is until you travel to your camp and engage them. I was always a "This is a PVP game and you gotta accept it ". kind of player, but over the past month it has become unbearable for everyone who has stuck with it and for new players especially. It has become almost astonishingly clear that this game , because of it's poor PVP system design has become a mecca for players who like to cause mayhem.  There has been no substantial effort to benefit honest players, ( other than the duping fix ) and every update allows further exploits to help the assholes who want to smash and destroy.  Even if they cannot get anything substantial, they just love to log on and start smashing whatever. I talked to a griefer guy last week and he said that the only fun thing about this game was the ability to figure out how to get through the obstacles everyone tries to implement against him to prevent his mayhem.  I got rid of my useless turrets.  I built a guest shack at the edge of my build zone with a weapons and armor repair bench.  Even put a bed and cooking station with a stash box down.  I have had 7 griefing incidents this week alone and I am in the mountains above Watoga, way off the beaten path.  They like the easy stuff first you see. Nearly every person or group was between levels 25 to 60.  This arrangement has actually decreased the griefing to my main dwelling.  I have time now to get off passive and FT in and engage them and either beat them down or have time to leave the server with very little repair cost. I am an Order of Mysteries vet and keep the Phantom device stocked up. I don't leave very often. I have counseled others for weeks now and posted that no damage PVE was on it's way.  I still believe that and am holding out, but I just downloaded another game today and it seems a lot more fun than to continue to put up with this BS.  Just saying.
---
Maybe just drink a nukashine towards the end of the event, if anything else you‚Äôll have a good time 
---
adds 10 carryweight per piece, for most armor sorts it basicly means the weight of the armor is completely made up for.
---
Speed Damon, and if you are willing to sell me 1x Cobalt flux I would appreciate it, I can trade you basically any other flux or caps
---
Yeah, a talk channel would be great. Like the talk stations in the GTA games with Lazlo.
---
Ok, I‚Äôll give you a cobalt for a violet. 
---
I made a post about this a while back. 
---
Nameplates: name your weapons and armour. But only on the client side of the system. Server only tracks it when you kill a player as it would show the name. And check for offensive names. 
---
Paint: able to paint your weapons and armour with the primary colours. No mixing or special colours. Those come from atom shop. And you have to scrap others for the paint. 
---
I put up the notice sign with small letters over to make a custom "notice: please dont harm cow" sign. (Ik its brahmin but cow fit better on the sign.)
---
I give low level people stuff all the time. Just handed a ton or legendary armor and ammo to a level 2 this morning. No weapons tho as I dont keep that many. 
---
Degenerates like you belong on a cross.
---
Try server hopping 
---
I don‚Äôt deal hyper lever of damage. If I remain hidden most of the fight adrenaline will cover my lacking. 
---
If they happened more often the reddit post would be title ‚ÄúRadiation Storms occur too often‚Äù
---
berserker + hazmat suit is my goto for most nuke zones.
---
If I'm in power armor in a building I still get rain drops on my hud
---
I would buy new radio songs on the atomic shop, along with ambient music packs with music from past fallout games to mix it up!
---
Dupers... Dupers never change... 
---
Maybe I'm thinking of food. Only special stats are overwritten when eating multiple food/drink items, with some exceptions. Some effects will disappear from your display, but remain active. Some will do the opposite. Unless this has been recently fixed, that is. Before taking the carnivore mutation, I gluttonously engorged myself with whatever I could use, cooking literally every available piece of food I found. It can be related to the radx, diluted, and radshield stack.
---
Sorry to steal your thunder. 
---
You sir, are my spirit animal
---
I believe the white springs bartender has some.
---
You might literally have been catfished.....I wonder how long charleston was underwater.
---
Em, you dropped Crimson not cobalt
---
Over all It's fun. The negative reputation, while at one time was very deserved is mostly hype at this point. it has it's problems, some are pretty frustrating. However, there is a lot of good in the game that you almost never hear about outside of the community of players. Most of the Community in game and here on reddit are pretty friendly. I suspect that most of us are Bethesda games veterans who are used to a little bit of glitchy play from time to time. At todays prices you don't have much to lose by trying it. 
---
r/market76 is extremely active
---
Okay, I got the caps psn: mutatedghoul 
---
My point concerned the situation in which the wanted player has no caps, so that you received no bounty.
---
Sorry, misread that. 
---
All good. Nice to see like minded people. 
---
At least it wasn't a hard no.
---
They do get bounties...
---
Why I don‚Äôt want you touching my shit. Your filthy paws rubbing all over my weapons bench and trying to lay down in my bed with your nasty dysentery because you don‚Äôt live in luxury like me
---
Online bullies. Losers that cant be tough in real life so they do this shit to players them act like they are bad asses. I had a group try to do this to me once. I carry a fatman and killed all of them three times, also had a guy enter my camp once and he got a dragon blast to the face for his bullshit. I absolutely hate a bully. Online or otherwise. So I take great pleasure in killing them and taking their shit. The last guy got a missile in the face, and his friends got exploding .45 rounds for their trouble. I actually got a bunch if hate mail from them all after like I did something wrong to them. Smh. Losers all. Cant wait till the changes are made so we dont have to deal with these fools anymore
---
Is there a way to see how much longer you have in the 24 hour reset?
---
Me personally, I'm probably dying to flying blue robots right out of the vault.
---
No worries, your place looks lovely, I have never seen teh shack near you before :3
---
Thanks! A random plan will spawn in back on the tv. 
---
I usually buy them from vendors like in flatwoods, watoga, whitesprings trainstation and there is a bartender inside the hotel on the first floor.
---
Well like i said i play on xbox and it wasn't a "NO PICS" but a " yo not now lets do the event" i guess he took it off when he got a new one
---
Similar thing happened to me the other day. 2 guys level 150ish tracked my friend to my base. He wasn't in sneak mode. I managed to kill one of them and log out before a ton of damage could be done. They only got 2 walls, 1 crafting table, and most of my garden (nothing important). Glad PvP mode drops next week because my base had never been attacked before (been playing since Christmas).
---
I hope they fix the bounty system soon. Killed at guy with a 1200 cap bounty and got 86 caps. I wasn't in a group, he just didn't have any money.
---
Would be kinda cool if the cap bounty just went to a negative balance on the wanted individua in PvP, up to a certain point. Probably wouldn't make a difference, but one can always dream. 
---
could take the base down faster with a drill. fatmans are horrible. 
---
Where was your camp?
---
I feel bad when I accidently shoot someone's wall, so I'd usually be right there with you, with thinking it's bullshit. Buttttt... I utterly demolished a Whitesprings Turret Farm today and enjoyed every moment of it.
---
Yep. 10%
---
I do not agree do to this being a survival game and the fact once you cook food with out a fridge you have about 3-6 hours where it is counted as safe. With a fridge about a week.  
---
This not replicating reality this is a survival game. And quite frankly how a lot of players played NV and 4. As fallout in survival mode is the best way to play. 
---
Drank himself to death on the outskirts of the Cranberry Bog.
---
pretty sure they get a big debuff then.
---
Been a neat feature for a while
---
Of course this will come with time. I want balance first, there are so many useless weapons in game now. I would rater have more things viable, before any new weapons.  
---
...which is no compensation to the person who doesn't get to collect the bounty.
---
Dang, no speed demon? It goes so well with marsupial. Sorry about your herd, I get attached to my moomoos as well.
---
I've never intentionally damaged anyone's base, so I was just winging it. You can tell at some points I don't even know exactly what I'm doing, haha. 
---
Looks like someone from rage 2 
---
What counts as a tamed pet?
---
I keep doing it, but the the number of people involved has steadily dropped since the first day. I have done the event too many times to keep count. I was collecting masks that people would drop and bring it to the next event. I don't even do that now, I just drop the same masks I have gotten well over a dozen times. There is usually a complete set of the common masks dropped at each event where there are more than 10 people running it.
---
**I have not seen any of the "rare" masks.** You have better luck collecting all of the asylum outfits and hats. I am still wondering if there is a "Forrest" (yes misspelled) outfit... different subject. 
---
Just saw my first today, luckily i was inside and had a gasmask. How do they work exactly?
---
The MG42 is pretty good now, but it needs mods! Especially one to change the ammo type, so you can craft a lot more ammo for it.
---
Texas Red ain't gonna be finding his way in West Virginia if that gets added.
---
How are you playing it? Im a level 13 and mainly do the quests, but i barely have any ammo most the time. Is it better to just do the special events to level up?
---
Wheres the fun in that you got got and now you pay
---
Farming the mutation takes an hour tops.
---
Nukashine?
---
I literally teared up the first time I heard tumbling tumbleweeds in game. It‚Äôs the most iconic song from my favorite movie that‚Äôs also what my religion/life philosophy is based off of. The fact that they got rid of that song personally hurt me in more ways than one. Haven‚Äôt been on in a while 
---
Used to.   Now they're like big flying breakfast sandwiches .
---
I can see how this has the potential to be a bit of a niggle once pacifist mode applies to CAMPs too unless the devs extend the 'no build zone' radius.
---
Despite numerous 'rebalances' the 'Whitesprings loop' remains a staple in exp grinding for many, myself included.
---
Bethesda is supposed to change it when pvp servers come. Slap damage will be near no damage and supposedly camps will be the same. I don‚Äôt really care if people attack camps on regular. It leaves at least some type of pvp and calm the rest of the time. Everyone has their play styles, likes and dislikes though. 
---
Abominations of physics where its a single foundation and stair going skyward 
---
just use a super sledge
---
Mostly white Russians and whiskey.  I've replaced water with those. 
---
For real though? Or is this sarcasm?
---
What ever.  Good luck!
---
Yeah, I eventually pulled out the all rise, but a) dude was nowhere to be found and b) it helped lower my weight with all those mini nukes from the parade.
---
Also, watching the mini nukes hit were like some awesome fireworks to me. Haha
---
Don't believe I have one in stock right now. 
---
Never knew that.  Thanks for giving me something new to do tonight!!!
---
I will be on tomorrow for sure
---
There‚Äôs a door that doesn‚Äôt open, it‚Äôs about as sure a thing as any in the game that there will be something added to it 
---
I'm just glad their little sonic blasts don't completely white out your screen anymore. If I can see them I can kill them.
---
Not in stock right now
---
Oh nice, I missed that, thanks for the cobalt, it was the last thing I needed for my decontamin shower.
---
Happy to help!
---
I keep a gas mask or space helmet, because those help in some areas. Everything else is just looks, or light protection (combat helmet, hard hat).
---
Because of the uptick in griefing episodes, I monitor my camp very frequently.  I saw a guy in my camp and watched him for a bit, expecting him to start accruing a bounty for smashing my stuff.  After a minute or two, it became clear he was using the guest facilities I had installed, so I FT to my camp to see what's up.  He was actually inside my main building which should be impossible without incurring a bounty.  I open the door and he waves.  I wave back.  He opens the second story garage door and beckons me to follow.  I do and he drops down a story, goes to a point in my steel wall and proceeds to walk right through it. I am bit flabbergasted at this and asked WTF!  He explains that if you have a workbench against the wall that touches the wall, then you can access the workbench and it pulls you around inside with the animation.  Nice guy.  I have come to almost abhor people coming into my camp here the last couple of weeks because of the griefers, but I try to keep a positive outlook towards everyone.  Initially.  What a nice visitor this one turned out to be.  Come to find out, we share the same camp location and he was just looking about and admiring my layout and wanted to point out a weakness to me.  He locked the big door behind him by the way.
---
I had to google niggle. So thanks for teaching me a new word today!
---
I mean, I spend a ton of time at Whitesprings because of all the higher, but not too high, levels that I can actually manage on my own. Once I saw 10 meat piles outside, I found a side of me I never knew I had. Lmao.
---
Wait the combat helmet offers stats?
---
I can guarantee you this is a pic/mod problem. They updated the tinkerers bench in the last patch. 
---
That's interesting because I got myself a fancy gold fasnacht hat drop. It's not like they don't just use the same code for the chance that you will get 1, 2 or 3 star legendaries with 3 star legendaries being the hardest to have drop ever. The rate is low, not 'bugged' because people decide to just make stuff up pretending they know the game engine.
---
Sounds fishy...
---
That sucks. I would be pretty salty seeing as some mods are pretty hard to find. I was lucky I knew the plans for my helmet.
---
Oh yeah complete bullshit. They aren‚Äôt hard when they land and your a melee build like me. But boy when they just fly it pisses me off and just send sonar after sonar wave. This is the reason I need me a twoshot explosive lever action üòÇüòÇ 
---
Preach brother! 
---
I actually have my settings so only friends can message me. Makes it less personal.
---
Like everyone said, vendors have them occasionally. The shack at Mac's farm can have some, the basement at the bootlegger's shack can have some, and the moonshiner's shack can too. 
---
Last 3 parades I did involved 2-3 other people.  Have to say though, it's gotten me to want to play with others and change my tune on wanting to just play solo.  
---
I just want to play fallout, the pvp crap is for the call of duty rejects.
---
I'm not sure, but it always had in the past. Really I just used one until I found a good gas mask. 
---
Half the vaults population was lost to the flying blenders...
---
People can be jack asses, especially when in groups of 2 or more.
---
Ah thanks 
---
Rare masks? I couldn't even get that stupid beret xD Just bought it today. Only 3 plans left to collect one way or another. As soon as i get them i'm done with the parade.
---
so uh, they got any of them rare masks from this event? lol. but really this was a concern for me when it came to light the drop rate for the rare masks
---
Could you describe the location of the Penitentiary spawn? I've checked there several times and only seen the power armor plan in the yard. Not sure if I'm missing one inside or it's just never been there.
---
Advanced connectors blueprint includes conduit and through wall penetrations, really tidies up the look
---
My mind is blown.  I have a base just on the north side of Watoga and have been farming it for months and have not seen or found ONE of these.  Man don‚Äôt have some ‚Äòsploring to do when I get back to the wasteland.  
---
They're so rare that we can't even get fool proof evidence that they are dropping. As someone who is hitting 70 runs, it's pretty discouraging
---
Yeah the way the dates are laid out doesn't really make sense, they should fire their graphic designer lol
---
Combat armor chest is the only ultralight mod you can unlock by scrapping. It's probably a typo. List of scrap-unlockable mods:
---
[https://i.ibb.co/5WvGhVk/armor-mods.png](https://i.ibb.co/5WvGhVk/armor-mods.png)
---
That's awesome
---
Yeah, happens all the time. Doesn't even have to be a bloodied build or anything. I one shot people all the time with a two-handed weapon, not even any kind of special legendary effect.
---
I Been Playing NON STOP SINCE Launch haven't got a single RARE MASK. I found The Fascht Man Mask at the Train Station on a Body though. I think that the Man Mask was in the game before the event. I have all common masks. I even did the Event by myself and Didn't get a Mask not even a Common one. So They are BROKEN. 
---
This. I was wrecking them at lvl 33 with PA and a super sledge. PA and melee is op mid lvls.
---
Flamethrower rad emmiter combo. The fire prevents fast travel, the rads eat health at a ridiculous rate when you stack a bunch. 
---
I have that one, it‚Äôs level 45 though, can‚Äôt find any mods either 
---
Your untitled to your opinion and that's fine. But I dont agree
---
Weapon durability might affect damage. 
---
Get yourself some excavator power armor and a super sledge. 
---
As pointed out this is perfectly normal but not only for that fella; you are also very likely to be able to one-shot an unprepared player that has been 'dropped into PvP' by workshop mechanics.
---
It is perfectly possible to have a fully functional build with such capabilities at your level even without trying - the key here being 'unprepared' - as most competent PvE melee builds and some ranged ones can output sufficient DPS to take down an ill-equipped and ill-prepared player in a single hit.
---
What I have not seen any evidence of - not saying that is impossible, is hard at times to tell what is achievable and what is not with the plethora of potentially unintended behaviours one can encounter, but at the very least unlikely unless under some fairly aberrant circumstances - after 900 hours of play is being one-shot through slap damage.
---
I have not once experienced this myself, witnessed anyone on the receiving end of it or met anyone that could provide solid evidence of falling prey to such travesty
---
 I've got a 2 tile locked room as my personal bedroom. Only a level zero lock, but enough to say "stay out of my room"
---
Just let me know when you‚Äôll be online so we can trade
---
I see, unfortunately, I used to be one of those *fools*. Then I realized other people appreciate the other games for other aspects, and that they're equally entitled to those opinions.
---
Maybe you have close them in a certain order.
---
Despite the fact they have part 1 of Butcher Pete, but not the flip side?
---
If i got this correct it seems like some robots have to die to even get a chance for the rare masks to drop
---
Would like to tell you but out of the three times I‚Äôve attempted it, it crashed my game twice before I could finish the event. 
---
By that level I was barely leaving the forest. Nukesdragons will help you perfect your build. Just keep trying. Slowly it will get easier until you can handle the tougher enemies. The 20 to 45 level was tough for me too. Soon you'll be one shotting ghouls at whitesprings with the rest of us though.
---
I lost count of how many events I've completed. Definitely more than 50. I haven't seen one. None of my friends have seen one. 
---
Hey Dani just going to explain to you the way your logic works. "Every article of clothing in FO76 can be work over armor except hooded rags. Must be a bug, everyone who cares to ponder past the bug is simply wrong." Now to rephrase that into the long term. Every fallout game has been selective about what clothing can be work with armor, and it was almost entirely unheard of until FO4. Since FO76 doesn't let you wear the hooded rags over clothes but let's you wear every other clothing, fallout is also the outlier. Since it's the outlier fallout 76 itself must be a bug right? Hmm I wonder where a one track mind takes you, seems fun to be blissfully unaware or in your terms "ignorant". Moral of the story is stop being rude and you won't get harshly debunked by several people. Be kind and they will be kind, unless they share the same track mind as you then they most likely will never be kind as they weren't raised properly. Finally you said you haven't experienced a single bug yet you're on a Reddit forum spilling your guts about how a clothing layer mishap is a bug. Stop beating up on people and maybe you will get a chance to be happy in life. If you're so obviously absorbed by a video game (to the point where you spend your free time arguing with others on a forum instead of actually playing the game) then you clearly don't have much of a life.
---
 Might as well give up on this as something that might get resolved. My guess is that the drop rate is bugged but Bethesda doesn't want to admit it because a) patching console versions cost money and b) they get slammed for every bug that comes up. There's no way they intended every rare mask to be obtained by at most one or two players throughout the event.
---
Easier just to say "working as intended" because it's not like they're going to lose money over folks not getting the new masks. Because it's working as intended, per what they've said, the drop rate is not going to change and almost nobody will get the mask.
---
I'm sure we'll see an article about this on Kotaku in a week :)
---
What‚Äôs the damage on it
---
Is still really popular along with Wes-Tek.
---
Terrible as it may sound I am very fond of mowing down ghouls myself.
---
Depending on their timings, it may only be possible in a certain order! 
---
I became one with the mole people and live in a giant underground paradise where there is no food bar

He was camped out infront of prime for me when  I randomly walked over, was strange as hell and all the mobs were attacking him

I think the ‚Äònuclear winter‚Äô play option, which will come out in 3ish months will make the environment a lot harsher. I‚Äôm looking forward to that one!

It's very close to the main entrance. I'm going from memory. From the fast travel point you enter the nearest entrance straight ahead (before the guard booth and parked cars). Once inside you head a little to your right (I think) into a room with phones and glass, like where the inmates would talk to people through glass. The back half of that room is unlit. There's a door back to the cell block at the back end of it. Go through the door and avoid the can alarm, and on your left will be a wooden barricade, usually with an enemy behind it and a cooking station nearby. While you're going through that door, in front of you and to your left, in the nearest cell, there are several work benches. The plan spawns in the back of the armor bench, almost always clipped mostly through the bench so that only the very top corner is visible. Use your crosshairs to scan where the bench meets the wall to see if there's one hiding in there. I server hopped about a half dozen times and only saw a plan about twice. I think it's a hotspot because it's supposed to be where BoS combat armor mod plans spawn.
---
But, it's very easy to server hop. I believe once you claim it it has a better chance of not being there for several hours, I don't know exactly how those spawns work. But hopefully you can find it with my directions. Good luck! 
---
I have seen a YouTuber who has 20,000 caps...
---
You probably shouldn't make this post even if you're saying sorry because other people will troll by doing it. You could cause people to be complete jerks by telling them what screws up the parade. 
---
‚ÄúHome sweet home‚Äù
---
I'll DM you
---
There‚Äôs like 7 around whitespring 
---
Correction: 85k
---
10 mm is hella cheap.  Add armorsmith perk and this is great fun.
---
I got it now, but thank you
---
There's a dude who made the deathclaw maze on YouTube who's also made a Brahmin launcher
---
That makes twice, he's jumped through a window.
---
I wouldn't take less than 7-10. It was three star they go for upwards of 12 to 20
---
Where‚Äôs the best place to get adhesive? I‚Äôm always short on it!
---
What do you mean by "it's probably a typo"?
---
I feel like corns the worst for this, but yeah.
---
You better not take any workshops still :)
---
Thanks
---
So you think there can be some there ? Ok thanks
---
Its frustrating because I build probably 2 or 3 times a month. My chosen location and size usually means a couple camp placements to suit my vision. There SHOULD be some sort of eagle eye view when placing for that matter. The problem is the compounding caps. 40 then 160 and it does go up again on the 3rd.
---
I thought the vendor was supposed to be accessible already. Do we kno when it will be?
---
I know that you‚Äôre talking about the numerical value, but they did say EXCEEDINGLY rare.
---
Now, I also know that there are some people on this sub that will never agree with my view on what constitutes ‚Äúrare‚Äù, however a 0.1% chance (for those playing at home, that‚Äôs 1 in 1,000) should be the maximum value IMO.
---
So then, I would think that ‚Äúexceedingly‚Äù rare items would have to be at least 5 or 10 times less common. This takes us into pretty scary territory, but considering the number of players involved, multiplied by the average number of times each player completes the event, that drop rate needs to be minuscule, if BSG really wants an item to be considered rare (as opposed to simply ‚Äúobtainable easily enough if you grind‚Äù).
---
Bethesda shit the bed once again.  Its cosmetic.  It's not like people are going to gain advantage with these masks.  I bet we see then on sale in the atomic shop in a few weeks.  The gameplay is decent but the programmers have dropped the ball.  They dont seem to understand its discouraging to not see one after 50 trys.  I know personally.  At first I was down to play this event.  But now I dont want to play any future dlcs even if they are free.  I'll pay 40 for the division 2 and at least be satisfied.  At this point after over 100 hours playing, fuck bethesda.
---
Holes on the ceiling, I would imagine 
---
Ok. Would 7.5k be reasonable.
---
a sink, why don't we have a dang sink ?
---
also to add to the tamed creatures i'd personally love to actually be able to move them since I can't get a friggin animal to go anywhere near my camp, they always stand at the base of a mountain and refuse to come within 500 yards  :(
---
And the game tells you as much when you take one.
---
I've already explored most of the map. What did you even do in the forest for that long? 
---
I really play these games mostly to explore. 
---
I have a explosive assault rifle as well.   3k.
---
Thanks! Appreciate the help
---
Okay deal if you wanna meet up I‚Äôm online now psn: mutatedghoul

What platform are you on?
---
Not bad.  Do this.   Post it on the market and give it an hour.  Take highest bid.
---
You've got giant, witch, soldier, toothy and owl, but no others right? Cause the other ones are these rare, seemingly in obtainable masks. 
---
Ill be on in a bit and add you
---
Will do
---
 No! They are my sport. The more the merrier. ;)
---
Okay
---
‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Where is 'Crawl out through the fallout'?
---
Oh, yea I'm on PC sorry.
---
I have experienced this myself.
---
Logging out and in again has fixed this and other 'main quest' related inconsistencies for me every time.
---
It‚Äôs ok
---
On Xbox you can have your Spotify playing in the background
---
Its just a waste of time. The event is too easy and repetitive. The motivation was the masks and the donuts, but now its just not worth it. 
---
Clicking walls together can be so frustrating lol
---
"It just works!" No. No it doesn't.  Nor does electrical.
---
Sweet build tho!
---
You can have a fucking pet cow?!!
---
Agreed.  They had a chance to fix it and did diddly squat.  
---
I've always thought we'll see the aftermath of the Mothership crashing onto Earth. I mean anything could have been in its cargo.
---
Next time don't bother accepting a group invite from someone you don't know. I learned my lesson a long time ago; happened to me just like what just happened to you.
---
Oops... this doesn't work... it gets marked as a question item and can't be dropped/traded...
---
I sincerely hope that is true.
---
that's a big old "no thanks!"
---
Cool, I'll be on in the am. I'll make you something better. Butt_ermybr3ad. I get home at 7am central time 
---
I thinks it‚Äôs fine the way it is you get a space suit it probably crashed due to nukes ya know 
---
People data mined the game and proved it is bugged and bethesda gave a bullshit answer.  They basically said you arent playing enough.  Well 20 hours in just this event and I havent even seen one on another player.  I'm playing till the event is over and if I dont get on I'm trading the game in.  
---
Where are the three people m the EMS building?
---
I know right? You wouldn't believe how many times I had to almost redo the entire thing because the game would say "Object is floating" or some other weird thing.
---
But they have improved it, I remember not even being able to really make anything other than a crappy little shack (Which gave me as many troubles as this much bigger, and more complex structure gave me)
---
And thank you man! Took a while, but I think it was worth it :D
---
I did, their only response to it was a resounding 'maybe next time' and I don't really see any point in doing hundreds of runs just to have a less than 1% chance to get even one of the rare masks
---
I came back to Camp once and there was a dead Scorched Beast lying on the ground and  MooMoo was standing on it, looking innocent.
---
It kicks out at me every time I milk it, not sure I trust my Moomoo.
---
As it turns out the price displayed does not include:
---
- Solicitors fees.
---
- Cost of applying for planning permission.
---
- Local council tax which varies from region to region.
---
- Waste treatment and garbage disposal contract.
---
- Kickbacks for - including but not only - Grafton's Major and MODUS.
---
Bear in mind that any changes to your property, however minor they may seem, may incur in one or more of these fees.
---
I built mine off yonder left of the post office. It's got a stage for music and separate sleeping quarters and workshop. 
---
Behind the lookout tower that provides a wonderful view of the parade, and just next to the water purifiers for thirsty travelers lies my power shed. Inside sits a single fusion reactor that powers my whole camp.
---
Feel free to use the facilities, and watch out for stray nuclear touchdowns.(I learned the hard way. My whole camp destroyed, but it was glorious.)
---

---
because Bethesda shit the bed and why would anyone ever want to grind a FO76 event again if there is no chance that they or anyone will ever get the reward?
---
Yea it happened to me to. They are restarting my server soon so I wonder if they are related 
---
How are you going to do that? 
---
Maybe the problem is I play single player exclusively too, and it seems like it may be enemy counts for multi-player and doesn't scale back.
---
I would say a good combination of really getting into the camp building. That and investing in endurance perks to negate all the survival aspects I wasn't a big fan of made me weaker than other players at that level who had invested in combat perks. I caught up though!
---
They only way to get one of the rare Fasnacht masks is to get some paint, glue and newspaper and make one yourself at home. Lets get this going if Bethesda won't help us out we can make out own anyone up for a paper m√¢ch√© challenge?
---
Acid rain man, shit's nasty.
---
That combined with scorchbeast guano makes quick work of any roof structure.
---
Making a killing here as a building contractor; found a much more profitable use for my All Rise :P
---
Made me smile from ear to ear and I dont even farm at Whitesprings.  Just the whole idea of these type of bases there irks me.
---
I appreciate max builds. Takes a lot of time and give/take with the budget to get them right. I logged on this morning and was like.... I'm knocking it down. 3 hours of regrets later....
---
It has gotten better but electrical is pure bullshit. I think walls should just be plumbed with it and anything else is wiring.
---
You can't transport a template of your camp can you? In other words, you have to rebuild it each time you move it?
---
I just build the workshops, stash box and a bed each time I moved because I was under the impression I'd have to build it all over each time. 
---
Show them. Show them who's resort it is.
---
Uhm just because it's not a big issue i'm not allowed to bring it up? üò∂
---
Well no one was claiming that survival mode is gonna fix the problems left behind by duping so I guess I don‚Äôt really understand your point. I was just responding to your thought about the ‚Äúimaginary caps duping created‚Äù. 
---
Just pointing out that you can only have 100k on an account so it‚Äôs not like people are sitting on millions of caps unless they have multiple accounts, but at this point if you grinded 5 characters normally you could match those caps.
---
I had the same problem as you. People told me to team up with others but I play solo so I felt like it was too difficult with all the overleveled enemies.
---
But I find out recently that server hopping does wonders. I'm level 20 and I was actually in Whitesprings today with level 15 ghouls. Might take a few tries but it's been working for me without fail the past few days and now I can actually play the game and complete quests and stuff!
---

---
I feel ya, I HATED setting the electricity up in my base, but years of playing Fallout 4 has taught me a few tricks of how to make the system work in my favor. But man, I totally agree that they should either make it a singular object which grants you power to your entire base, or at least a hefty portion.
---
I caught him a few times trying to spawn the witch
---
I'm not even sure how you could do that. You can't build directly in town.
---
Now I finally understand why there are naked people at all of the events I go to
---
Lol
---
*Free Beef*
---
You might have to server hop to get some to show up. I definitely picked up a mountain honey moonshine at the shack by the vault this morning. Sometimes an actual moonshine will spawn in a spot where an empty jug normally does.
---
This just ruined my day. Swinging on a Star was my favorite.
---
I meant that people seem to think that about survival. 
---
People also seem to only consider the weapons and armour of duping. Not the caps. 
---
Tbh I wouldn‚Äôt be shock if someone does. Would explain some people‚Äôs reaction about the idea of make a new character. 
---
If memory serves correct, the devs released a statement saying that the horn volume was lower than meant to be and would be fixed soon.
---
I'm online now PSN Chronic_coit
---
Agreed! My experience with this game is very different each time. Sometimes it's great sometimes it's a grind and leaves me devoid of ammo and stimpaks. Whatever happened to the private servers? 
---
Should just affect glowing mobs. 
---
This bug has annoyed the hell out of me for ages, that and I‚Äôd really love the hud to disappear when I remove my helmet.
---
Giggity.
---
I mean, I did the event once, and I enjoyed it, but I usually just do events once. Maybe eventually I get in a mood to run one over and over. If they left it year round, I'm sure I'd get the urge at some point to spend 3 days doing it over and over. But I dont happen to be in that mood now; in fact usually new stuff makes me nervous for a months or so until I ease in.
---
So I haven't give up really; I did it, it was cool, and I'm good for now.
---
I have a low level alt with a shop build that was being destroyed by some level ~50ish guys, kept asking them to stop but they didn‚Äôt care. Hopped on my main, and suddenly they‚Äôre not interested in PvP anymore. So I attack them, finally one Attacks me back and they‚Äôre both dead. I see them fast travel somewhere, so I go there- sure enough it‚Äôs a nicely built camp- I used quite a few orbital strikes on that thing but I never felt better :)
---
If you wanna try to take them out together we‚Äôll split the bounty. My PSN is radiationdaddy
---
got SFA, but was quite successful.
---
distance is what I‚Äôm disappointed about mostly I don‚Äôt know if those go hand n hand, but I hope so.
---
Alright you can meet me at my camp if you want 
---
This will not stand, ya know, this aggression will not stand, man.

---
Not being able to find the hunters longcoat that only appears with a rare vendor in Charleston. ( been looking for days)
---
Yea that‚Äôs what I thought thanks 
---
When you move camp it's saved as a blueprint under your stored tab. You should be able to just plop it back down. But depending on how complicated a build you have and how much it interacts with the terrain, placing it can be finnicky to down right impossible. If you are wanting a mobile base, make a one foundation one with a ladder going up, and then build the whole thing on the second level. It looks a little tacky but you only really have to place one foundation, so it usually works everywhere.
---
Yeah but I‚Äôm saying that you can only have a limited number of caps and the same amount can be achieved thru grinding. I‚Äôve never duped and I‚Äôm sitting on 60k rn and I buy a lot of stuff so I could easily be at max caps. I get your point I just think it‚Äôs not as relevant as the armor and weapons. 
---
We‚Äôll see how it goes, it‚Äôs only a beta after all.
---
All I see is strangle pods near where the gulpers spawn
---
wish I was him haha.
---
Forgot bloody I have that also, switch it out for serendipity sometimes though as I don't have enough in luck, got to keep my mutation perks on lol
---
It's not a part of fallout New Vegas or fallout 4.
---
I managed to rack up a 500c bounty recently doing that to a turret camp. It‚Äôs the only time I ever get a bouncy and I always invite the nearest person to claim the bounty without a fight. It really is quite satisfying lol.
---
Also what would be better for a rifle build? Bloodied or tse or?
---
I know. Just throwing out a lesser known fact that doesn‚Äôt get brought up. And still matters somewhat. 
---
Where did you redeem your code? If its through theBethesda site it should keep in purchase history. 
---
There‚Äôs always one, and that‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt have nice things, as they say. You just hope that you run into them so infrequently that you can say ‚Äúoh well‚Äù and move on. In around 150 hours I‚Äôve on run into ‚Äúthat person‚Äù maybe 4-5 times.
---
solution pop a couple more brewskis and get more mutations
---
This is a lag issue and most likely your connection. It happens when you spend too much time in camp editor. I dont know how exactly it is related. I used to have this problem until I changed to much faster internet.
---
Which masks are rare. I heard someone mention a king of winter mask or something. Thats all I know.
---
I had the greatest degree of success at nighttime while Heart of the Swamp is up.
---
If this is for Biv's daily - Pickaxe Pilsner - please bear in mind that currently alcohol that you find 'in the world' works just fine too.
---
It‚Äôs hard to find anything about it googling it. I guess I have to wait and do the heart of the swamp public event for them to spawn?
---
Are you running a sneak or loud build?
---
Just go buy serums from a player...
---
Like 250 caps each
---
Alright maybe I'll work on making a base and do some stuff in the forest a while yet. 
---
What platform? 
---
No sneak. Not yet anyway still debating on going all out sniper build. Leveling is slow at my level
---
I hate closed doors. YMMV. :)
---
lukily that one douche cant be on all the servers at once.
---
power substation just north of watoga. guaranteed deathclaw
---
Sorry man, but mine are in water, and they die within 5 min, and I can't do anything about it.  But, I can milk them, and kill them, so nothing is wasted...... Besides,  they make so much noise,   don't you MooMoo?...
---
Ohh, come on baby... you know I love you.
---
Lol that‚Äôs a lot of words to say a simple thing, it definitely used to happen when you could stack bobble heads but haven‚Äôt seen it since.
---
And I lied it's at 270 damage not 170, still feel slightly weak though. Would a tse lever be better?
---
Deathclaw island, it‚Äôs north a bit from mothman museum 
---
It says I need to craft it
---
Ash heap, toxic valley are good for mid level too.
---
I stopped playing after just getting harrassed by high level players and a having a hard time with just being over encumbered all the time.
---
Or can I just pick it up and that‚Äôll work?
---
Did the server crash?
---
Yeah, I ended up kicking my teammate and he claimed it. It ended up being like 260 or something. But only because dude finally realized his camp was being fucked and I would have been killed immediately. 
---
Except, he showed up, my bounty was gone, and he immediately server hopped and/or logged off. Like, what? 
---
im on xbox, and on my 76th run of the parade. i havent see a rare mask and i ask in the in game chat if anyone was lucky and get thumbs down and nos. and with all the people on this sub reddit i would think we would have better than sketchy screen shots and two people saying that the guys got them from a friend. and really since yesterday afternoon the quality of the runs has gone down, from people afk to just walking around and letting robots die.
---
No it doesn‚Äôt 
---
Fixed.
---
Look up "exceedingly" 
---
I haven't seen one yet. I bought the moon one because it's funny.
---
I agree with what your saying 100% I‚Äôm grinding and have been and ain‚Äôt getting shit. 
---
I don't understand what wasn't clear in the message for OP. Beth stated clearly that he traded with a duping account. 
---
I guess some people can only see what they want to see,
---
I'm working on the kill 20 played achievement so if I see a bounty I go and claim it. Most of the time people seem like they just want it gone and usually give a wave or thumbs up after I kill them. 
---
Call me stupid, but how do you lose up on RADs and keep your mutation?
---
Yeah I did those. I'm on the far right sight of the map. I'll stick to farming some dailies and base building. I've never really tried base building. 
---
Damage kinda. I do better with non tse levers. 
---
the creeping late night dread of my own mortality usually
---
It did for me! When I loaded back up, he was gone. I‚Äôll go over to you and give you some aid and ammo though. I‚Äôll do it in a trade after the event - request what you need and I‚Äôll see what I can do.
---
Neither of those can be tamed. If you follow the main road through the mire there are a bunch of random spawns that *can* be deathclaws tho not guranteed (server hop changes it). If you google fo76 random spawn locations there is a map that shows you where they are.
---
Maybe like a huge radstorm w/ sb‚Äôs? 
---
I've done the event over 70 times... I hope they aren't bugged or that would make my grind a waste of time. 
---
Bloodied build's drop rate is one of the main reasons I play that build the most; I've been doing the event like crazy in full unyielding and NOTHING.
---
OK -_-
---
Boss üëΩ fight when nuked would be cool
---
Care to elaborate or just in general?
---
I want a horde of supermutant behemoths and option to build liberty prime in watoga. Maybe even the big alien thing in lucky hole mine wakes up. 
---
Alrighty 
---
Buzzbites should be in the game
---
This event really screwed the server stability up, or maybe it was the last patch but if no one gets the rare masks are the countless disconnects during the SBQ worth it? I wish they‚Äôd focus on server stability rather than events like this that don‚Äôt even seem to work.
---
working as intended, maybe next time. ‚Äúit just works‚Äù
---
On XBox but thank you for that run through! I‚Äôll try it next time I‚Äôm on.  
---
Melee vats 1shot through a wall isn‚Äôt a problem ?
---
Yes, currently picking up one 'from the world' will satisfy the quest objective. 
---
Not only that, you can keep some - and other alcoholic beverages - if you wish to and they will 'work' just fine.
---
I say 'currently' because I have not the foggiest if this is intended or not, I am guessing it is though.
---
It happened in Fallout 4 as well.  It always annoyed me that I was inside the garage of Red Rocket and rain would be on my visor.
---
I'm convinced that they don't actually exist.
---
Lmao üòÇ
---
I'm much higher level, I have a few legendary I don't use. I can make you a gauss rifle, I can even make prime receiver. I'm speckled riffle, so I can help you speck out for it
---
Dont waste your time selling to this guy.  Just made wait, came over the cancelled the trade with no explanation and left the server.  Pretty fishy.   I don't have time to deal with wishwashy people.  
---
is it possible that you have a higher chance for a different reward when u actually go with the parade? I used to camp on the roofs and only got that owl mask 4 times in a row. Today I tried going with the parade staying close to all the bots and I got two new masks after two events. 
---
I work 12 hour days so today was the first time I have played in a few months. Was hoping for something fun to being me back in but oh well!
---
Trueeee!
---
I lock the door to my main ‚Äúhouse‚Äù on my camp but I also have a side ‚Äúshack‚Äù with crafting tables and a bed that is open for all to use.
---
Agreed
---
I think anything outside should require the messing around, inside should just be wired. +1 copper to floors or something.
---
I didn‚Äôt downvote you for the record
---
Rose did 9/11 
---
BETA codes? Or the full game? Either way I'd say you're sol
---
And make it so they go into negative caps when the bounty is claimed
---
Not as bad as you may think. On Xbox I sell them for 100 caps a piece. 
---
Totally agree. My friends and I don‚Äôt take team invites from strangers for this very reason. None of us got time for that bs. 
---
I don't use bloodied or have the adrenal mutation. It's usually instigating or all rise. I do have talons and twisted muscles with class freak maxed. 
---
Yeah. That's a high level area. It's a survival game. Everything has a cost. Weapons and armor degrade, you have to use resources like ammunition to kill things .. You're in the home stretch though. 
---
I do over repair them, i'll have to test that and see. Thanks
---
Yeah I understand, duping sucks is really the main thing lol. Hope to see you in survival mode!
---
I‚Äôm still holding out hope that after the beta we‚Äôll have a mode where you can bring your character and a more hardcore one where you have to start fresh. Preferably once the duping problem is fixed, if that ever happens idk.
---
Okay Ill check out the sons of dan compound then. Thanks 
---
Im really only collecting mine to put on a shelf in my c.a.m.p
---
full game. i know its a long shot
---
He is clamps down my favorite bot there.
---
You can drink nuka grape and Braman milk 
---
try getting a rare faschnacht mask. ;)
---
&gt; None of the absolute guranteed spawns can be tamed
---
I know, I'm not asking about scripted spawns.
---
&gt; If you google fo76 random spawn locations there is a map that shows you where they are.
---
This is exactly what I needed, thanks!
---
I said sorry dude, I got a better offer from someone. Sorry for wasting your time
---
I watched the first couple seasons. Just curious how it is referenced. I don't notice anything but love this sort of stuff. Any info would be awesome. Thanks in advance.
---
Sry i still need it but it got too late 
---
Sent, waiting for accept
---
Wild wasteland? Are you combining wild Appalachia and wastelanders?
---
Yeah, Biv gives repeatable daily quests. I‚Äôm stuck on the first one cause I can‚Äôt figure out where to get ‚Äúfresh beer‚Äù in order to advance the quest..
---
Nah I highly doubt that. I‚Äôm better off winning the lottery.
---
Well, at least you learned how to read and write......
---
But this post tells me you missed the most basic lessons in life.
---
Explains the hate for the game set in this time period.
---
"turns out, we opened a vault full of dickwads, sorry bout that." 
---
i hate to break it to you , but finding a creature that is tamable is hard enough but finding a specific one thats gonna take alot of server hopping
---
How many TD did you turn in to get all three?
---
No one says you have to use bloodied. I never use it, I don't like living on the verge of death constantly. 
---
 Few ways, sun kissed removes them during the day, there might be a couple other endurance perks related to removing under certain conditions, then there's charisma perks like rad sponge in team play, and there's specific food items that do so as well, i think nuka grape removes 800? 
---
I feel we all should go do that and state that yeah got nothing from the lottery just another Faschnacht Parade.
---
You can build C.A.M.P.S for others? I did not know that. I sure wish someone out there in West Virginia would do that for me. 
---
I‚Äôm just a poor lonely survivor with no friends, no prospects, and a half eaten mole rat sandwich. Story of my life always the brides maid and never the bride. 
---
Only 1!
---
Is the event busted on pc? I been waiting for 36mins straight no event, server hop a lot no event, its not even the end date, what gives.
---
Happened to me, I chose the buy option and it let me download it again without buying it again. 
---
Pleasure.
---
This is not the only place it spawns by the way, it is fairly common and can be found in a lot of places, is just that those guys really liked their booze so there is often a... decent selection at their place ;)
---
@ladydevaan @valseek
---
Yeah lol. Like honestly. Only one person in existence has the goddamn mask! That‚Äôs a problem! Glad Bethesda configures they‚Äôre fixing it.
---
Oh I know. I have no problem with the survival aspect (basically boil water and collect meat off everything). Thing is even early on, for example that prison area which is relatively center. That place is swarmed with super mutants. I often feel undwrpowered and at a loss as to do anything about it. Plus I was under the impression some of the scaling is related to other players in the game. 
---
Dies in silo bravo because of those mfing assaultrons
---
that nothings free? well the game should be f2p but that is neither here nor there to my post now is it. good day to you sir
---
Ah, don‚Äôt give up that easy. I build my CAMP, farm Whitespirings for fun, just generally mess around. If you like Fallout its fun, I think, even with the random d-bag. I also like helping newbies out by giving them stuff when I can. The good guys outnumber the bad guys by miles. I‚Äôve really been getting into the trading on here too. I‚Äôve only hit one a-hole on here so far in trading, besides the mysterious downvotes seemingly for no reason. Ask a serious question or make a serious comment and get downvoted. Oh well.
---
I am thinking that when the survival mode gets in, and the change gets made so your CAMP can‚Äôt be randomly destroyed, that the troubled souls who cutely call themselves ‚Äúraiders‚Äù to justify being an a-hole, will go elsewhere.
---
Dude I got stuck in 2 today alone lol. What are they even good for?
---
Yah but that dudes like a level 91 glowing alpha matriarch deathclaw. Welp good luck I guess.
---
Damn, endurance had to be my least invested in perk.
---
That sucks. Can‚Äôt say the same for me though, I just hung out with a bunch of randos completing the Fahsnacht Event several times... no griefers in sight.
---
I wouldn't be mad at all if they add a new songs to the Atom store and that way artist can get some money per purchase too.
---
Do you have a PS+ subscription?
---
After level 40, I could solo them with melee. My only complaint is that some never seem to want to land.
---
It is. A lot of the Savage divide is like that. Whitesprings too. That prison was tough for everybody ha!
---
Sun kissed only costs 1 point :)
---
You. Cannot. Take. A. Workshop. Without. Initiating. PVP. 
---
It sounds to me like you have 24 hours from the time you posted this to complain to them again and let them know that whatever they did hasn't fixed your problem...
---
2.5k?
---
I was wondering the same thing.. Inquiring minds want to know
---
Nice, I'll keep that in mind.
---
Thanks I appreciate it 
---
Also your loot can‚Äôt be taken. Only junk. 
---
+Karma
---
Also make a junk equivalent that acts as a no scrap option 
---
Sole survivor was closest we got. And he didn't take long to kill.. you're right. Maybe not then... shitty.
---
Fallout 76 requires PS+ on PlayStation. I don't know why, that's Sonys doing.
---
Got the code from GameStop when I pre-ordered it to get into the B.E.T.A.  
---
Activated both the B.E.T.A. code and the Retail code through the launcher.
---
There‚Äôs one On top of the nuka cola plant.
---
Ask them to change it?
---
r/choosingbeggars
---
I. Understand. That.
---
In the case of the workshop, the matter was that a) they flat out told us they were just after our caps and b) as I said, things weren‚Äôt working properly. They weren‚Äôt going wanted or turning enemy for blowing holes through our structures. We COULD NOT DO ANYTHING but slap damage. They were invisible. VATS did not work. Etc.
---
Theres almost always one in Hopewel Cave (Just south of the pumpkin farm). Its reliable enough I send people in as a joke (then save their ass if need be). Most of the time for me at least its a 80+ Deathclaw, usually glowing.
---
The fast travel map is in 76 but only for workshops. 
---
I personally want more wall options. I like the barn set but I'd prefer them to be brown and I'd like lower windows on them. I'd also love a roof with a skylight. 
---
I have been emailing them for the past several days, even replying to the original email to where they say reply after I had change my user but no response yet.
---
What do you think loot is, exactly? I personally consider my springs, gears, Hardened Mass, etc to be very valuable. Obviously, they did too.
---
Just a heads up, apparently if you own a workshop and join the parade, so someone on another team can contest the workshop and kill you while you are performing the parade. I was not able to inflict damage on them, but they were able to kill me while I was helpless to defend myself. Just a heads up if you take workshops and join the parade.
---
You still willfully joined PvP. Don‚Äôt feel bad for ya. 
---
I milked Chally the Moo Moo about 3 times while someone was trading with Grahm. Timeframe was like 5 minutes.
---
You might have to try your luck again with support. GameStop wouldn‚Äôt be able to help with that because all digital sales are final sales. You should have some proof of purchase from when you redeemed the code. 
---
Is there any confirmation that tamed animals like deathclaws are aggressive or defensive towards other players, say, shooting up my camp?
---
That‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt need your pity. :)
---
Yeah that code is nearby, just leads to a storage area with lockers. You can find the spacesuit and space helmet in there
---
OK. I'll add you tomorrow. Wont they have a level requirement? 
---
There‚Äôs a level 20-something deathclaw on a ridge up the hill and left from White Powder Ski Shop. I could pacify it but haven‚Äôt upgraded that perk to the max yet 
---
OK, well thanks for your advice. I'm working on a base now and it's pretty sweet. 
---
Loot is: ammo. Weapons. Armor. Food. Drinks. Chems. 
---
Also. Maybe stash your shit? Lol 
---
Stop crying saying people are griefing when they aren‚Äôt. 
---
All are defensive and will aggressively chase enemy's down to an extent
---
Ok, I'll bite, what was your name?
---
9,800 to 11,000 caps from vendors depending on perks or chraisma.
---
If they'd done that at launch, this wouldn't be an issue.
---
With the caveat that normal CAMPs with one or two turrets for genuine defense are okay. It's specifically turret platforms that can and will eat Kovac-Muldoon.
---
I hope he ran away from you crying like a little b***h. üëç
---
Hopefully he will think first, before do8n* something else stupid.
---
40 caps to move it, but it charges more depending on how much of your build budget is used.
---
Obviously, but I got you 
---
Same...
---
Like I said. We were at Scorched Earth. Had just finished it. No stash box out there at Prime, is there? Please read the post before snarking.
---
Awesome!
---
Customer_Support lmao because I want to be that nice and give randoms stuffs that I dont need.
---
Really? I guess I just figured with its rarity that nobody would want to get rid of something so hard to obtain. As far as we know, none have dropped from the actual event and until I see hard evidence of it then I'm going to go ahead and assume that any rare masks posted are from the dev room. Personally if i were to receive a rare mask from the event and have proof to back it up, I don't think there's anything in game that would make it worth the trade. Nothing would be as rare as the rare fasnacht masks so anything that anyone would offer would always be less valuable. But that's all just my own opinion obviously.
---
not sure but the missile silos kinda look like ufos
---
Get starched jeans before you even decide to get mutations. Class freak should follow. 
---
I think it's real, but have to laugh at the thought of it being fake and I'm walking up to a deathclaw with my max animal level thinking Scorchbeast said this works, as I get eviserated by a deathclaw... ha
---
I'll buy some for my nephew next weekend if your on
---
I've seen two of them in game. Don't go crying that it's broken just because you didn't get one. They said they'd be "exceedingly rare" and they are. 
---
Where does it say that? Please send a screenshot where that's explained in the game. Then explain why that's not included with the price of moving your CAMP. 
---
LOL when I read the first part of this post I thought you were talking about me, since I totally trashed someone's CAMP not too long ago.
---
Done!   Thanks for the heads up
---
You got there right after the other event ended. It starts 60 mins after the last one started.
---
So if they got done in 15 mins itll be another 45 until the event starts again.
---
My lever gets close to 500 bloody. I don't even have the rifleman perks maxed out. Add demo expert, bloody mess, rad cool and adrenal Reaction. 
---
I can only carry one at a time and got a few waters and some .38 the last 6 times I tried it. Can you spare some of that luck?
---
Wait, you dont need the protectrons to move at all. As long the the mr.handy does the circuit you good. We were trying to get a zero damage run. (For science) We were trying to pin them on the bridge behind power armor. That way the wolves and stingwings later couldn't get the hits in, and made protecting them from the supers very easy. Couldn't get it to work for more than a few seconds before they teleported around.
---
Got a pic?
---
Which is pretty much how raiders are in-universe anyway so it kinda works out. 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a good idea, might need some tweaking since in the survival game mode you can place bounties on other players. If someone puts a 2k bounty on your head and you only have 500 caps it wouldn‚Äôt be fair for you to do 25% damage. 
---
Sorry for adding so late but it's Xicotli. I sent it 
---
I didn't score my first SB kill until I was level 60 or so.  Of course, I purposely avoided them until then.  Once I started using VATS and melee attacks, I agree with others, I found them not to be that difficult.
---
His content really came off as I'm here for the views. Most videos felt like he was feeding into the population that truly just wanted to see the game hurt. I enjoyed his stuff where he was more a journalist and reported on content. Reporting on trending topics, mostly about Redditors was a bad move because the sub was so toxic. Like he'd never report on anything good. He sold out his fandom for a hate train. I mean it's his channel and I still follow but I definitely watch a lot less now. 
---
He lost his journalism badge when he tried to frame his news. Imo.
---
So if you're using demo it's bloodied explosive I take it. That would help. I kill myself a lot with explosive guns though lol
---
Good point. Didn't really consider that. I have a problem with being too antisocial sometimes.
---
What bothers me most is when I'm sneaking around and the supervisors spawn in the uranium fever event and I instantly go into danger until they get killed. This is also the case for some random ants I encounter and I think it's happening pretty regularly with the honey beast spawns in the faschnacht event. Gears. Grinded. Sneak. 
---
Good luck man, I think Bethesda is a fish out of water when it comes to Live Services.  Seems like they should have already had a fix to get people back in.  You're the guy that put in like 870 hours right?
---
Yea I didn‚Äôt see one there. I guess I‚Äôll just keep an eye out for it. Someone just nukes the parade so I had to check that out so there may have been some I missed.
---
I couldn't figure out how to point you to a previous response to this question I answered before so I am just copying and pasting the same response I gave :)
---
There are two guaranteed places I can tell you that you will get animals to tame. You will most likely need to server hop to find one but if you keep up with it you will definitely find them......eventually.
---
So position number one is the lake next to the Thunder Mountain Energy plant (east side of the map). Fast Travel to the Power plant and head south and run along the south side of the shore of the lake until you find pieces of a crashed yellow plane. From here I have tamed a Mega Sloth, a Rad Toad and a Yao guai but there may be more.
---
This is where in the map you want to mark (where my player icon is set): [https://imgur.com/YlHLJwX](https://imgur.com/YlHLJwX)This is what the plane pieces look like: [https://imgur.com/GbavR07](https://imgur.com/GbavR07)
---
Just a head up this does glitch a few times so if you see a dead Yao guai floating in the air that was probably the tamable animal, I have seen it loads of times: [https://imgur.com/kRYsuSY](https://imgur.com/kRYsuSY)
---
The second place is in the top right of the map. Fast travel to the Fissure Site at the top right to the map and run East (and run because there will be a Scorchbeast there). Keep heading east and you will eventually come to a lake with a crash Vertibird in it. From here I have tamed a Snallygaster and a Rad Toad and I have seen other people found Mega Sloths and Deathclaws here as well.
---

---
These sites also spawn some pretty interesting events sometimes so its normally pretty entertaining anyway and other times its more scary stuff (one time I went there and there were literally 3 Scorchbeast right on top of each other just above the ground). If you come across an Albino Deathclaw he is an event and is NOT an tamable animal, there is normally a dead Brahmin around him as well.
---
You pretty much need to go to these areas and see whats there. If there are no tamable animals or none that you want you need to join another server and keep doing it.
---
Interesting. I haven't seen anyone really mention Ft Defiance.
---
I just had the same thought, they could definitely spin it that way.
---
Ya you could stash your shit before the event. You aren‚Äôt getting junk from that event! 
---
But please. Continue to cry about how people played the game fairly. I‚Äôm sure everyone cares. 
---
Yeah I always call them cowards and they get mad but it‚Äôs actually just part of the lore. They‚Äôre too weak to be lone wanderers and too disorganized and strung out to make a real lasting impact like the BOS or enclave. Instead they prey on the weak which makes them cowards but as long as they can accept it then it‚Äôs all part of the canon. 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a  MEGA TEASE on Bethesdas part.  Spent hours trying to get one and still haven‚Äôt 
---
Yeah true. Guess I assumed incorrectly. My apologies. I only use it for long shots. Have a bloody shotgun for closer. I have noticed that sometimes you need to equip it and unequip it to get a better damage reading. 
---
Oh wow, yeah I don't think I'd have the caps for that, I'd have to settle on trades D:
---
Like I said. All the doors were closed and needed to be unlocked. I feel like you have a increase chance of getting them from doing that. Also I think possibly if you have higher luck stats you have a higher chance of getting the plan. (I have 7 points of luck)
---
I would assume it's like nuka dark both cola and alcohol.
---
And that they cannot do any damage to any player or camp, initiate PVP or accumulate further debt until that inital amount is paid off. I don't want to see players end up accumulating so much debt in the game that they lose all interest in it. Theoretically any debt could be paid off by a little grinding or finding a couple cap stashes.
---
All these people are wrong, you have to shoot every balloon. You won‚Äôt get a mask if you don‚Äôt.
---
I'm pretty sure I've seen it before.  If I recall, you can't go in it, and there is no interesting loot nearby.  Still cool nonetheless.  üëç
---
Holy shit. I had the exact same encounter and glitch at white springs. I'll send proof later.
---
I can help you out with quite a bit, will add you tomorrow.
---
Are you talking about the crashed space station
---
Right? It makes complete sense, raiders aren‚Äôt even very dangerous unless you happen on a larger group of them. In all the games they‚Äôre pretty pathetically weak. 
---
Well I'd just keep this policy to PvE mode. Anything goes in survival as far as I'm concerned. I don't intend to touch it.
---
I have well over 100 runs on this using all 5 characters and I am with you that it is totally bugged.
---
Already seen the sun mask 
---
K but I been server hopping a lot too and usually I would find a couple, even my new character can't find any.
---
You won't regret it.  It's the most hysterical thing you will see tonight.
---
That's the thing that doesn't make sense to me, it SHOULD be in my transaction history right? At least as some sort of recognition that the game was activated on the account? Because there is NOTHING on that page. Not the fact the game was activated, or the fact that for shits and giggles I bought $10 worth of Atoms. Neither of which are showing up on the account. They show up on my damn bank statement, but not the account itself.
---
No no no no. You have kill every squirrel and cook the bits in order to get the donut recipe smh.
---
I suspect they intended all ultra-light mods to be plan-only, but someone selected one too many mods from the list. There are some other "freak" scrap mods though: Marine BioCommMesh and Marine Pocketed.
---
Or, if I was banned, for whatever reason, there should be some form of notification or something that should have gone out to me I would think.
---
doing my 79th parade right now. and my will is weak. lol
---
Ok all you guys are worrying me now. Because now I think this was a once in a lifetime thing that happened to me.
---
I‚Äôve done atleast 60+ and haven‚Äôt got one lol. 
---
It doesn't show you, doesn't tell you anyway.
---
Try it yourself. Like I did.
---
Honestly you might be stuck playing a few rounds of Bethesda support roulette, may the odd be in your favor.  
---
This sounds so incredibly stupid.
---
I'll see you in 5.
---
This has nothing to do with dupers I dot get why you‚Äôd even bring that up. Sounds like y‚Äôall claimed some workshops and weren‚Äôt aware of the PvP implications, now you are. 
---
This is not griefing tho and by using the term like this you strip it of its meaning and significance. Maybe take a minute to read up on different ways you can be engaged in PvP and be mindful not to do those things. 
---
It‚Äôs not Bethesda‚Äôs job to hold your hand and ban anyone who kills you, I hope when the new pacifist mode comes out you never turn it off.
---
That‚Äôs an interesting thing to try, now that you explain it. I personally have seen the protections ‚Äúteleport‚Äù ahead near the first stop at the toads, when a couple of them got left behind after they took off to go fight something away from the rest of the group.
---
I bet if you ran the RNG numbers it‚Äôs something like 1 in 300k or something so it‚Äôs pretty lucky to get 2 sets of paint in one data.
---
They are so rare they are obtainable. I‚Äôm 50+ in and not one rare but I did get all the decorations and beret. 
---
I can‚Äôt figure it out for the life of me. 
---
Workshops are broken. I understand the PvP part of it but it should be regulated to the workshop area. It's never fun when being ganked by a group of people who fast travel to you and then one of their buddy's start the claim.
---
Thx bruh
---
Here is a preview of the "orchestra" we have right now:
---
https://imgur.com/262qxwt
---
Yeah, I thought I found a UFO too, but it is just the top.of the silo where the nukes launch from.  I've seen people post pictures of the nuke exiting even!
---
I find starched jeans a tad too stiff.
---
Surely fabric softener is the clear winner here :P
---
I didn‚Äôt get 2 paints with one data. I‚Äôm just saying how I got those paints in one day that weren‚Äôt even that far apart from each time I got them.
---
this. Wiring the garage door sucks, I'd much rather have a switch and power connector on the inside of the door...or just let us go up to the door and open it like any other...even if it has to be powered still. 
---
This space station looks very much like one of the [Ballistic Orbital Missile Bases](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ballistic_Orbital_Missile_Base_001) that were in the canceled non-canon project Fallout: Van Buren. They were basically strategic bases to launch nukes from orbit for the US. While there was a back story written for it already it is non-canon and can be changed to however Bethesda wishes, which has happened to a lot of things from the Van Buren game for use in Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas.   
---
TLDR: Could be a missile launch platform or a future quest checkpoint maybe for the BoS or Enclave.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø 
---
Go to deathclaw island on the left side of the map in the river. 99 percent chance of 1 deathclaw and about a 30 for 2 
---
Cant seem to join your game...
---
And you came to that conclusion after playing it the first day only? Hopefully you never get a job reviewing games with a biased outlook like that.
---
Interesting 
---
because someone builds their camp right beside the station.
---
Survivor mode incoming...
---
Its ok ive noticed i go through more cores than ever now no idea why im using the perk card
---
The stairs are made by a guy who can create nuclear fusion out of a few board games and gun parts. They've gotta be like carbon nanotube stairs or something
---
Same 
---
I like the fresh feeling of the starch TBH. To each their own
---
Yeah, I stumbled across that literally the first few hours of the Beta.
---
I am loving all the salt from players who think they deserve a rare mask and didn't get one.  üòÅ
---
Friend and I run and share level 3 of those I usually ghoulish and her radsponge. Makes ya pretty much immune to rads and to mob damage in a nuke zone.
---
How do you know it should be free to play if you, yourself have never played it? Get out of here with that crap, guy.
---
I don't not believe you, I just think if they're gonna implement a... "system" like that and not tell players, it's just as bad as a bug. Heck, maybe it's still a bug either way.
---
Maybe giant space ship that spawn ins waves of aliens and a flatwoods at the end?
---
Only time strangler bloom shows up is at night or during the heart of the swamp event. If it‚Äôs night go by the river next to dryer chems and you‚Äôll see them glowing. If they aren‚Äôt there just server hop to another night time server and look again that‚Äôs what I did also the alcohol you find in open world still counts for the biv quests. 
---
Personally I don‚Äôt like any of the masks
---
All cosmetics as far as I know. Sell em or drop em. 
---
Me either 
---
EvilNate83, ps4, looking for deep pocketed leather limbs plan.
---
I just don't have doors anymore for this reason 
---
I'm just spitballing, but... when people attack someone's base, the attacking player's real-life address should pop up on the game, and the victim of the Fallout attacker should have the option of going to the attacker's real house with a super sledge. Hmmmm... I'm still sorting out some of the wrinkles...
---
Ah, I see your a man of culture as well wearing brother hood of steel paints.
---
That all I want is the dam beret nothing else keep getting the same mask all the time. 
---
Fair enough, I think this would be ideal for adventure mode but the problem lies in group exploits. Once you attack one person with a bounty their whole group can attack you. So even if the penniless wanted survivor couldn‚Äôt damage you their whole team could. I guess you could have this apply to anyone that‚Äôs in a team with said person as-well and it would work perfectly

Someone at Fasnacht had a bounty and was begging people to clear it. I said OK and turned off pacifist, shot him a couple times and he kills me before the final blow. He ran back and grabbed my loot, even saying "thanks" before porting away. -_- Every time I start thinking people aren't going to fuck me with me, someone fucks with me.

Yea I‚Äôm currently searching for the beer. Know any good spots where alcohol spawns?
---
Each shot. 
---
It builds with every bullet that hits the target.
---
(Note: this is how it worked in Fallout 4 with Problem Solver and Splattercannon, both of which had those affects and were devastating commando weapons, it could be different in 76, but I doubt it)
---
Workshops are worst since they allow players to attempt claim it anywhere on the workshop boundaries, so all they have to do is attempt and they can pvp you without getting wanted, rinse and repeat to farm your deaths. Other two times did they get wanted after killing you guys at the queen and camp? Its possible they did chameleon glitch to have invisibility even when standing and running, and they might have blocked you on the server, with unyielding to have higher stats to avoid vats.
---
I've been wearing my beret in power armor for days and haven't had any problem.
---
What if......the Masks that we have been getting ARE the rare masks.  
---
I didn‚Äôt realize Stable Flux and Hardened Mass were so invaluable. Hey, if you don‚Äôt want yours, I‚Äôll take them off your hands since mine were stolen. üòù
---
Is the bot dead?
---
The frat houses always have lots of beer. Also it may suck but check a couple vendors and maybe buy a beer. If it‚Äôs pickaxe Pilsner you‚Äôre looking for I‚Äôve found a few bottle of it when looking on the back wall of the bar at bivs place
---
AlpineYJ
---
Still alive
---
Oh my bad I saw someone ask ‚Äúhow many TD you turned in to get all 3‚Äù and you said 1. I just assumed that meant all at once lol but now I see what you meant.
---
For some reason I can‚Äôt have more than one TD in my inventory, it doesn‚Äôt actually stack so I always turn em in right away. Actually had over 100 saved up before I knew what they were and once I started the quest they all turned into 1.. ooof!
---
There's the ammo plant but I never have enough ammo to defend it to make more and people have no problem wrecking me for the plant
---
Most bugs are really hit and miss for person to person.
---
Yeah, either that or the bounty gets pulled from the group.
---
Molerats  because they can teleport at will, they are supposed to go underground but the moment they go underground they appear above ground some where else. This is very easy to see with vats if you have a lock on the mole rat that teleports.
---
Thanks.
---
I read a lot about people trashing camps etc but it never happened to me or anyone I play with. 
---
Almost that I wish someone could come and spice things up :)
---
But to be serious, it sucks when people are assholes in games 
---
Anytime
---
You can‚Äôt tame set spawns only random encounters.
---
It usually spawns at the shack, so if you didn't find any, that means someone else on that server already got it.
---
We had robots at full health at the end at one point tonight. Had my hand over the print screen button hoping that would be it but unfortunately nothing. Even secondary was just common. 
---
Just like to add that the wood piles around the event seem to be taking almost 2 days to be lootable again. I understand that in normal areas but for the event those should be lootable faster imo. 
---
Also just wanna say I agree fully about the masks. I understand Bethesda wants some things to be rare, not everyone should have everything easily.. but it should be obtainable. Most ESPECIALLY if you're going to limit this event to one week only. 
---
Instead of worrying so much about an in game "economy" that no one really gives a shit about, I mean seriously we all know how to make caps with vendor runs, we all get maxed out at 25k, it's not much of an economy to begin with, but by not letting these items drop at all, you're discouraging people from playing more than you're encouraging an economy. I'd understand if one mask had a ridiculously rare roll, but half of them arent dropping. And I barely see anyone even bothering with the event anymore. 
---
Fallout games in general lend to a lot of people wanting to be completionists, I dont understand what they were thinking. 
---
What so the whole community. Your not fucking cute. üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ 
---
For a mask ? Don‚Äôt be ridiculous 
---
You didnt get one and if you did it‚Äôs from dev room. Don‚Äôt be a smartass 
---
I just want the beret, rare masks be damned!
---
This just worked for me! Great advice 
---
I've seen two in game. I didn't get one, but I'm good with that
---
tunnel snakes rule!
---
While I commend you for doing your duty to destroy the vile bastards, that was really embarrassing to watch. I mean come on, a dragon..... 
---
For PVE it‚Äôs all about that Instigating lever, one shot anything besides a SB or mirelurk queen 
---
Unlockable atom store songs
---
Yup! I definitely didn't get one. But I have seen them, they're out there. A few people will get lucky. Most won't. I think that's cool.
---
Yeah, those adv.conduits really make the places I build nicer overall.
---
Lmao!
---
I tried! I've literally never damaged a base on purpose, and it was one of the few guns I was carrying.
---
I'll be better, I promise! 
---
I think radstorms should also give a chance at a rare mutation that's not obtainable from any other method in the game or  they give the same mutations already in the game but with zero side effects.
---
Which are the ‚Äúrare‚Äù ones again? 
---
Deathclaw island is a scripted spawn, and so can't be tamed.
---
Sounds like pets need to be behind a locked door with turrets pointed at it.
---
This is a local WV artist actually. She does a lot of WV cryptid art that's super rad. 
---
Here's her Insta profile

As a West Virginian artist myself, support ya artist peeps :) 
---
Here's the thing.   I ran the mission tonight.  We protected the robots until we reached the end point with all five robots still intact.  The robot starting to talk about lighting the fire and then the mission failed. 
---
I mean... what the hell? 
---
"Ultra super mega rare"
---
I'd call something rare if it dropped like 1-5% of the time. Dropping at (0.03%, UNCONFIRMED but the only actual data we have to go off, the user poll) would make them ultra super mega rare.
---
Aha yeah that deathclaw has been there every time I stop by, I think it's scripted.
---
Not a problem at all!
---
Double explosive perk, workshop destruction perk and explosive shotgun works wonders. I racked up almost 400 the other day. Guy had a fully furnished rocket camp behind the clubhouse, and I leveled it. 
---
I hope it holds up.  earlier in the week I had the same thing, got kinght, kinght cpt, knight sgt and officer all drop for me.  since then I've been dropping dozens per day without getting paladin.
---
I've done it twice now, had a friend get me most of the common ones though
---
Big rip F
---
I agree with this 100% *anyone* who intentionally destroys CAMPs are losers.
---
And I mean anyone, unpopular opinion, and I've never made a turret farm camp, but the people who act like it's the worst thing in the world are a blight, and when the new pvp update comes out I kind of want to make one to spite them.
---
I want 24 tubas.  A whole server of tubas.  
---
Same, not sure why you got downvoted. One of the first events I did, someone was already wearing it. 
---
Did I say that? I asked if it was something that you actually experience. 
---
Has anyone wore the fasnacht mask that was already I game the whole time and seen if anything was different?
---
And the most horridly timed disconnect goes to...!
---
Quick question then: does sentinel exists and did you get elder?
---
Yea I tried to trade with him but he just ignored me
---
Posting the same thread over and over again is totally going to drop the rare mask though, right?
---
You know I noticed the same thing tonight. Might as well have not even had the PA on. Plus the cores barely last at all.
---
Weird stuff
---
they drop in order if you learn them. (and then never again).  paladin would be next for me, then elder.  so far as I know sentinal was not added.
---
I keep doing the event, might as well. But do I think I'm going to get a rare mask? No. 
---
people are hoping to get npcs in the wastelander dlc in the fall but there is no offical word it will ever happen.
---
were any of the peices reparied past 100% originally?
---
Yep all to 200 percent
---
They have to. Not having NPC's is a like cellphone not having texting.
---
Never, as far as anyone outside of Bethesda knows.
---
Winter king, sun, jester, toothy are the ones I know about. 
---
I don‚Äôt want to set the world on fire...
---
I frequently forget and then am relieved and thankful that I can fast travel from inside.
---
They're the goblins of Fallout.
---
With atoms able to be won in game for free, couldn‚Äôt bathesda actually lose money if they have to pay royalties externally?
---
The world was actually pretty OK after the bombs fell. Green grass. Animals. Blue skies.
---
Then Vault 76 opened.
---
no they dont. lore wise (as it currently stands) WV is dead except for vault 76. there are no npcs.
---
the story (to me since it is an opinion) works fine without npcs.
---
Paladin is going to be a paiinnnn for me then. I can‚Äôt sleep now thinking about how hard I would need to grind.....
---
Never, same way ESO/WoW, any MMO doesn‚Äôt have AI NPC‚Äôs.
---
We ARE the only humans alive out the vaults right now, where are they coming from, did we skip 50 years and have babies and our babies are now our meatshields?
---
Nah, it‚Äôs an online game and you honestly need to get used to it, it‚Äôs simplify not feasible for a multiplayer title to have every single person run around with an AI, servwe controlled companion that has to send/reciece data consistantly. The game already runs bad, if others can‚Äôt do it what makes you think Beth can?
---
It‚Äôs simply not Fallout 5, where the world revolves around you and YOUR story, it‚Äôs a living environment brought to life by the players around you, or supposed to be.
---
I don‚Äôt see where you playing Solo has anything to do with it neither, you‚Äôre not really benefitting being in a team unless they have mutations and share perks, an AI can‚Äôt do that.
---
NPC conpanions would cripple this game.
---
The damage is going to be different depending on your perk cards and strength stats. My strength is only 10 and I'm not set up for it, and it is 152.
---
The owl is cool.  The soldier and giant are fun.  Witch and the balding dude are ugly.
---
It was a fun event, but I have several of all the commons and am ready to get back to grinding my nuke zone abilities.
---
They shoulda made the rares a little more common though.  Or told us more about what to do.
---
That‚Äôs good to hear I‚Äôm getting discouraged on the Xbox getting decorations. My alpine beerhaus way up on a rock really needs them to be complete. 
---
I really just like having a pet or something to help alert me to enemies when I'm distracted and a million other little moments. I agree NPCs aren't needed for the story lines.
---
I went to this same spot and the first time I found a "Fresh Grave"... Rest in peace little buddy!
---
Can't someone make a mod to add your own music files to a new radio channel in f076?
---
Okay no more tubas tonight.  We‚Äôre going to keep trying.  Stupidity for everyone!  
---
Overdosed in my lab while trying to find potent and new chem combinations
---
The stories are great without NPC's but I like a  little creature or something following me around picking up stuff and bringing interesting things to my attention, etc.
---
Lol that was different. Left a bunch of ultracite plans for you.
---
Honestly it wouldn‚Äôt be of any benefit, same way Fallout 4 companions are pointless, they‚Äôre just background noise, useless in combat, dumb navigation meshes with even worse Enemy detection an engagement, trust me NPC companions wouldn‚Äôt be a good addition
---
It's only in New Vegas but was a sort of tribute to the dark comedy of the older Fallouts. I thought it was in Fallout 3 but I just looked it up and I was mistaken, they just had the alien crash landing as a random event regardless of perks.
---
I was actually thinking of a player-made challenge using this mechanic: keep server-hopping until you find all my holotapes/notes and win a prize!
---
The bar is open too. Drink up
---
Churr
---
lol they get extra damage resistance the more over 100% they are repaired
---
I nerded the fuck out when i saw the crashed space station. Reminded me of the hours I spent reading the Fallout wikia lol
---
Come join me while I do it again!
---
I get yah now thats sweet 
---
Camp plans and a legendary sloth at the end. 
---
You down to help destroy it again?
---
Nice try FBI
---
What were the results?
---
in the same wastelander dlc some are hoping for robot companions.
---
Downvotes, but it‚Äôs player interactions that supposed to make the game interesting. If this were any other survival game it wouldn‚Äôt be unexpected. 
---
reason im asking if anyone has a code or not i only played within the first week as stated and you guyz basically proved how bad the 76 community is. You all coulda have just said no or suggest i ask and see if another friend has a physical copy but you all got big mad its a wonder no one likes this community and that is saying a lot as i love fallout but due to my situation i was not and have not been able to get a copy even when on sale but hey jump to anger i'll stay with the FO community that does not get mad over a question and get butt hurt when obvious issues with the game they play is obviously ignored but mmkay anyways imma get back to playing NV tootles.
---
Bloodied super sledge with swing speed and strength bonus. Grognax is good but you cant over repair it so you miss out on a lot of extra damage
---
No I just wanted to know because I got on a server and it was superlaggy for about 20 mins and then it stopped when I think some one left
---
When they loot my water purifiers ü§¨
---
Never said I was against server hopping, I just wanna make sure I'm looking in the right places.
---
What if all the data analysis that you get for the steins, you collect and trade in for a rare maskü§î
---
read my reply to ATXlien23 take care child
---
Yes, don't care.
---
i am unsure what this post is supposed to mean
---
I recently switched up my PVP build because of the vats and critical hit nerfs nobody seems to care about. I went from automatics to single shot pistols. I now use an anti-armor black powder pistol. My sneak attack critical hit head shot does 1,823 damage. I get one shot. If that does not instant kill a 300 HP player in the new Survival mode, I'm going to be disappointed.
---
I feel the people who complain most about being one shot are people who are ignorant to PVP and have no interest in it. You cannot one shot people in every circumstance. That 1,800 damage I can output won't actually kill anyone at maximum VATS distance due to damage falloff. In terms of melee, they deserve to kill in one hit. Those players open themselves up to being gunned down easily before getting into range. They also completely lose the ability to use that VATS dash if their opponent simply crouches down. Combined that with marsupial and you can just jump over their attacks.
---
Recipes and mini nukes. 
---
Thanks everyone and will be getting it soon and joining you guys out there 
---
It's there a sub for trading or did you just random buy it offline?
---
It might you never know fingers crossed
---
I noticed a group of about 8 level 2 players this afternoon, all names like hxyog1405. Standing in the EXACT same spot. I observed them, they were all idling around the stash box, sold 6 different serums to the station vendor, then traded with the leader, who had a normal name and a red dress. Then they all left one at a time after trading. 
---
Something very definitely wrong with the behaviour. I assume was some kind of duping or exploit
---
Nope. Tested this with a friend. He killed my cow and didn't get a bounty. Only destruction of settlement objects counts for bounty status. The cow is not scripted as an settlement object. The brahmin pen is.
---
"You're" lying about having seen any in "your" game.
---
Here come the ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt understand Pvp‚Äù. Comments. 
---
Just hang on til they fix it. 
---
there is no special way to get it. its entirely random.
---
FYI i live in Europe so might be wierd play times
---
Sun, Old Man Winter, and some others 
---
Loot is everything you pick up.
---
I have turned in so many and got jack. 
---
Build you camp in a tent. Boom! No more doors
---
But only bloodied if yoy are running a bloodied build. If not, than the bloodied perk does you no good.
---
Lol it just sounded like something a cop would say. You kids know where i could get some drugs?
---
They asked what the best is and best damage wise is without a doubt bloodied 
---
what system you on?
---
Can't argue with most of the points you make.    
---
I guess my servers have been oddly full and engaged.   
---
My last one 10 minutes ago had 14 people, (4 of them me) but the numbers are dropping, first couple days EVERYONE was there, and I think it's less about the repetition and more about being discouraged based on what I'm hearing from the players there.  
---
Hearing someone frustrated as heck/rage quit level mad because on their 25th attempt they still don't have either of the two possible Recipes, especially on a week long event, to say nothing of the masks, is worrying.
---
Duped account?
---
When i started playing i had like 5 of them (2 on 2 different servers after a server hop) but havent had one in a long time.
---
Weapon levels go up in increments of ten. The highest level pole hook you can get is level 45.

‚ÄúAnd so the dweller who had left Vault 76 just 25 years after the fateful days when fire rained from the sky had left their mark on the Appalachian Wasteland, with help from his fellow vault dwellers they were able to help contain the scorched menace, but only for a short time. Learning of the fate of the once great powers in Appalachia, The Responders, The Raiders, and the Brotherhood, the dweller was forever changed, once thinking that the so called ‚ÄúFree States‚Äù had the right mindset before the war, he was turned away and joined the Enclave, he would contact the control station of what was once ‚ÄúSan Francisco‚Äù and set up communication with a base called ‚ÄúNavarro‚Äù, during his days with the Enclave the vault dweller would be one of the first recon teams sent to what was once the great capital of the U.S., now it lay within an area known only to few as ‚ÄúThe Capital Wastes‚Äù, during his time in the Capital Wastes he gained access to a base called ‚ÄúRaven Rock‚Äù and met a mysterious Z.A.X. Computer, referring to himself as ‚ÄúJohn Henry Eden‚Äù who sent him on a task to deliver him a F.E.V. Chip for unknown reason, he was sent to the ruins of the New England Commonwealth to find the labs of the ruined C.I.T. Building, finding the chip and bringing it back to ‚ÄúJohn Henry Eden‚Äù. After that he was sent by VertiBot to the ruins of Las Vegas and a Mojave Wasteland, he was sent to retrieve a platinum chip in the remains of ‚ÄúSunnyvale‚Äù which was ordered by the great Robert Edwin House to be delivered to the Las Vegas Strip‚Äôs Lucky 38, he was almost successful in his operation but had lost the chip in a area known as ‚ÄúPrimm‚Äù. Once he returned to Appalachia he went out on a journey to find an old friend.. a stranger... a Mysterious Stranger....... 
---
When I first saw blank holotapes outside the quest that is related to then I thought "cool! Holotapes so we can add stuff to them like journals or to do lists or whatever. Fantastic" but alas. No writty stuff yet
---
if we able to play pool or darts that be freaking amazing 
---
Nothing.
---
Do you *know* how many poor, innocent squirrels I've killed?
---
I'm a MONSTER! *sobs*
---
As a new low level person, moments like these with you veteran players is what hooked me on the game! &lt;3 It's really been a fun, hilarious, and generous community to be playing alongside.
---
The even changes slightly every time. And each player usually focuses on a different task. Which makes the event very replayable.
---
The same as you, but it is kind of nice to know someone visited and looked around. Especially if they managed to not destroy anything üòÇ
---
I dont have a bloodied build, i have twisted muscles, and max slugger so i find the all rise and  grognak( i waould like furious, more dmg when target is full health and 40%faster speed on it)

---
I‚Äôm going to farm tonight to get the sausage and my last banner, any others have your name on it. GT: Elmo on stuff!
---
How about instead of random drop you get a rare drop for all bots surviving with no damage or something unique.  I never really got this rng crap.  Give us a unique reward for doing something special.
---
I mean you can have one guy single handedly finish all 5 parts then defeat all the super mutants and kill the sloth himself and he will get a common drop.  Another guy could join 30 seconds before the event ends and get a rare mask.  Kinda stupid if you ask me.
---
About as annoying as the "I took a PVP zone workshop and someone killed me" complaints ey?
---
I didn‚Äôt respond to your post, I responded to your comment about this game being f2p. Look up the word context and then don‚Äôt come back, mmkay thanks!
---
Found this thread, because that literally just happened to me. Had all pieces for the quest except the right leg. Spent an hour gathering screws and black titanium for the right leg. Happily went to finish the quest which did trigger but the power armor chassis I had was empty. All gone. Have to start over, super pissed right now.
---
I've run it only 10 times, but every time had 15+ players, almost all in masks.  Never seen a rare mask.  Some players I've seen several times at all hours, so some of them seen to have been grinding it for days now.
---
Go for instigating 
---
I have had almost exactly the same experience. Barely had to deal with people like this at all in my hundreds of hours playing since launch (only once in the early weeks of the game) and now it‚Äôs happened to me FOUR times in the past week. 
---
Some people try to claim it‚Äôs just raider role play or part of the game... if you want to role play as a raider that‚Äôs fine, but it doesn‚Äôt mean you get to be completely inconsiderate of other people who choose to play the game differently to you and ruin the game for others.
---
Yes I love that place. It was cool having a realization that I‚Äôve never thought about what would happen to the space stations after the nukes were dropped.
---
Ok!Do you know a good place to farm for this?
---
No wonder when i milk it, it turns red!
---
I hope they add some abominations as cryptids, if if they add snowy areas they could make it like an abominable snowman type thing? 
---
Okay. I was just letting them know that bloodied does nothing for you if you are not running a bloodied build. 
---
The community aspect is great. I mass craft stimpacks to give to lower levels and then sell junk or weapons to the mid-high teir players. Ive made about 10k just doing that plus about 2k from the event rewards. I'm having a blast even though I probably wont get a rare mask
---
I couldn‚Äôt find this post to reply since I‚Äôm new to reddit but FYI I‚Äôm not subscribed it came up on the main screen 
---
How do you even get to that point? 
---
I have shot people in PVP while they were loading in. You deal zero damage. You had control when he killed you after **seeking revenge** and **opting into PVP** yourself.
---
I want a dog or a robot companion that I can build like in 4
---
I‚Äôm having the same problem with bourbon and I tried refreshing and it doesn‚Äôt work.
---
You've got my vote!  
---
This is said so many times, and it isn't cool they still didn't add this feature to the game.
---
Watoga, whitesprings (not just the golf club but the houses to the left), harpers ferry, generals steak house,  wes tek. Really anywhere there are large groups of enemies. Make sure you are doing events.
---
I thought it was a good event.  Have played it 30 or so times and havent got a rare mask.  A little disappointed but it's ok.  Only real complaint I have is how slow the fuckin robots walk.  Adds 5-10 painful minutes.  Unnesecary 
---
Definitely agree, I love it so much I made a base just outside the crater.
---
Uhh, I'm doing one right now with 8 other people. Tbh I feel like most of these kinds of posts are anecdotal, even the rare mask ones. 
---
I dont have a route but I may have to find one. How much time does this route take and how many caps does it net in average?
---
The sloth thing had happened on all of my roughly dozen runs.  The only solution is wait for the sloth to go meatpile and then you can loot the meatpile.
---
I'm ok with the Forest levelled enemies, for most players it was so easy we all got to wear our wackiest (but unoptimized) parade costumes.
---
I mean that's also not true. Bloodied does nothing if you are at high health but you dont need a bloodied build. You can have whatever build you want and just let yourself dip to low hp occasionally so you can do a ton more damage. 
---
If you really aren't cool with the doing lots of damage thing than try to find antiarmour or instigating instead
---
I have like 6 Toothy Man masks. 
---
Are people having trouble looting the steins and beeswax? I'm on xbox with about 125 runs (server hopping of course) and they're always there and lootable for me. I wish the same could be said for the wood piles being lootable. (Did I misread?)
---
I sort of don't wish the mob level (or count) scaled if a bunch of lvl200's or whatever are going to afk on a roof. It sort of depends on how they would implement it.
---
And what about when you don‚Äôt wilfully participate in PvP?? 
---
I play on peaceful and I‚Äôve had my CAMP demolished, Ive been continuously attacked as I try to keep playing and ignore them, AND I‚Äôve been killed from slap damage by a player with a power fist when actively trying to run away from them. 
---
That‚Äôs 100% griefing and I‚Äôve had 4 instances of this in the past week. Compared to it only happening once before in the many months since launch. 
---
Personally I‚Äôm not, I still do every fasnacht parade I can.
---
It works with each shot. My furious explosive handmade take ouy scorched beast in 31 bullets if they all hit. 
---
Pvp is super imbalanced, and with plenty of people using exploits to grief. I don‚Äôt know how survival mode is supposed to work...
---
I‚Äôd like to patrol the wasteland with a fully power armored enclave team at my side
---
Everytime a vault dweller launches a nuke, a radstorm gets its wings üòá
---
It's a really long way
---
Is toothy rare or an I mixed up on what your talking about? Looks like a man but his mouth is exaggerated right?
---
I didnt seek revenge, it didnt ask me, it said respawns and I chose the same location. 
---
Oddly none of mine have meat-piled, that or once they meat pile others can loot them, as I haven't found one yet from the Sloth. (I've kept my servers up for as long as 12 hours)  
---
Great counter point on the lower level enemies.....  
---
But maybe make the Sloth a little harder... Half of the players at the event don't have the chance to tag him.
---
If your on xbox I can give you a beret, I‚Äôm ashamed but I‚Äôve snatched 3 total.
---
People that close doors and whiners. Not much worse in the game. 
---
amazing really? i tried really hard to love it after the initial release but i cant. tell me what is it u still find fun?
---
All these other people posting how they only have 2-3 other people doing that event. I've had at least 6 every time. 
---
I can give or sell you one if your on Xbox.
---
I stopped reading at "guyz" 
---
Get a job, mow a lawn, help a family member out, sell the useless object in your room that you've kept for way too long...and then buy it?
---
Attacking the entirety of the fallout community for rejecting a very butchered attempt at begging makes us want to help you less.
---
TLDR - In the time you've spent posting this, you could have made the money
---
Also, download Grammarly
---
When that little but of foliage clips through the walls into your CAMP
---
If you have the bloody mess perk you can attack it and break it apart and loot it. If you use a fast weapon like a buzz blade or something it's fairly fast to do.
---
Lol, pretty much sums it up for me too. 
---
I love the interaction, absolutely. I would love more events like this and the SBQ. World events and raids are great!
---
That being said, Whether intended as Bethesda says or not, **it's frustrating saying, "Dude where can I get that!?" and be answered with, "You can't." or "You have a 0.03% chance."**
---
I (and many others) have known about the masks since launch, even a little bit before. The strategy guide [listed 9 of them](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498856718705360907/558690517500690432/Faschnacht_Masks_List.png). In the Noclip doc, it was explicitly stated that there were masks to collect. I was stoked for it, to explore and find them all.
---
The Fasnacht robots even wear the masks the overwhelming majority of us can't get. This isn't AT ALL the first case of things just 'not' being available for players. 76 is full of these. Have you seen the [gas mask variant of the Ritual Mask](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/498856718705360907/523511175439450112/Fallout76_12-15-2018_6-46-37_AM-181.png)? Just an example of something else awesome that we can't have.
---
Antiarmor and instigating still do a ton of damage. You are talking like bloodied is the only way to go. With instigating it takes me no more than three hits, with my deathclaw gauntlet, to kill level 68 super mutants, I take down scorch beast within a few hits. And that is with my health not having to be low. I am just trying to give op some other options besides bloodied. 
---
Your story does not make sense then. PVP ends when you respawn instead of seek revenge. He would only deal slap damage to you.
---
yeah - I was at that ( PC ). Ithought I must have missed something at the end like maybe something happening to the robots etc. I got the loot from the sloth and nothing else. You would only fail if all the robots were killed I imagine. Didn't get my 60 caps ( travel expenses ).
---
Kinda want to crossbow hunt and smoke or dry food to save !
---
If you remain on the same server they are instanced, I've been keeping the same Server up and in it for up to 12 hours at time.  
---
Also at least for the PC players (all the data points I have) the Steins remained instanced "some of the time" when players hop servers.  
---
   
---
No you read it right, Wood Piles are also instanced, but the typical 24+ hours.  
---
First point on the AFK's...
---
I can provide all serums, including the three serums you are asking for @ 400 caps each. IGN: jchamlin
---
And you know that how?
---
&gt; You would only fail if all the robots were killed I imagine. 
---
That's what I thought... but ever robot was alive and we failed.
---
If yeh cant enjoy the sillyness,  yer in the wrong game
---
And the cultural aspect, fasnacht day is real
---
And they do wear masks like these
---
Get out.
---
Craft as much as you please, Bethesda confirmed a couple weeks ago that the helmet is available in game albeit rare.  
---
This is actually quite an important point.
---
Radiation storms are benefit from a perk you can pay for.  They regen you. How often do you really find a rad storm when you would ever want/need one? I really feel like I see maybe one every 2 weeks (that still seems generous.) 
---
Basically, the point I am trying to draw out here is they are capping a build card.  I think providing more storms would bring a little more value to this perk. 
---
Had something similar happen to me. Friend killed me, friendly fun PvP, and instead of it letting me respawn, seek revenge or ignore, it just throws me straight into a loading screen. Didn't even get to pick where i wanted to respawn. 
---
Even had it happen in a nuked out Morgantown. Loaded into the world, no idea that it was nuked so i died quickly. It throws me into a loading screen, still in Morgantown so i spammed a ton of stims and radaway while waiting for my power armor to spawn in. No idea why it wouldn't let me pick a place to spawn in at. I wasn't even over encumbered neither times
---
Well they tweaked some things for better performance, maybe it's related&gt;?
---
"so I killed and ate him"
---
Is... No one going to question this? Bueller?
---
If your on xbox I'll take one.
---
It seems to vary wildly, but when they all spawned for me I ended up with 600 caps or so. I should add a note in there that cap collector doesn't trigger sometimes until you loot/look at a stash the first time then come back after a little bit.
---
It's not the people that got reinstated. As a matter of fact those accounts appeared to have been resuspended 5 days ago, the night of the new event. I believe alot of people in endgame got bored after Whitesprings farming got nurfed.
---
I am still not convinced. If they removed it or hid it better then they would have the possibillity to test that out with the event as the drop rates of the masks are InSaNe!  
---
It's the perfect plan. Also it would guarantee that hackers could be banned almost instantly.
---
That sounds like something a synth would say ü§î
---
Ign, rojjin
---
 Is there anyway we can have our character names above our head instead of our usernames 
---
Buy them while you can cause you sure as hell ain't gonna get them items to drop. 
---
If done tastefully.
---
I mean, he does say "Our late night fair is still available (I went at night) just have a seat."
---
Then they redrawn when you server hop right? So hypothetically if I got the perk and the bobble head I could hit max caps in a few hours.
---
Bloodied isn't the only way to go but it does the most damage consistently which is what I consider best.
---
Instigating is really great at whitespring and just general solo stuff especially combined with sneak. Antiarmour is best on scorch queen.
---
*Looks at dupers with disgust*
---
The big secret...
---
Play the game.  That's how you earn caps and XP.
---
Ok. I admit I haven't played in a while now (gaming computer needs repairs). What's the deal with these bases and why are they being blown up? When I was playing I usually set turrets on my water and my "cabin". You don't get exp for the stuff your turrets kill (IIRC) so why put  them near spawns?
---
The fact that I couldn‚Äôt open that door only made me more intrigued. 
---
I hope there will be a quest attached to it in the future, like maybe you find a computer inside the station that asks you to fulfill your astronaut duties by repairing certain modules and running tests on space (which of course you aren‚Äôt in anymore but you‚Äôve got to find a way around that to get your loot).
---
Pvp doesn‚Äôt end when in groups
---
You run your build and I'll run mine.
---
Server hopping will no longer respawn the stashes. 
---
I salute you sir!
---
Awesome, thanks man. That's all I needed to know.
---
Let's do it again. Now. 
---
Sorry mate, I'm on PC :(
---
This event is power by false hope.
---
You can also peek through windows and activate beds/chairs/workbenches the same way to phase through walls. The only way to circumvent this is to keep all usable objects away from windows, or to use the wooden walls and lock the shutters.
---
The Mutations / Diseases / effects failing to display is not uncommon, why it suddenly displayed though...  
---
Several times recently I've had perks stop working (Locked and Loaded 3 times tonight) requiring the card to be removed and re-equipped, wonder if it's related to that.
---
Okay but anyone complaining about the ‚Äúprofanity‚Äù that would be on them...
---
It‚Äôs an M rated game. 
---
M for mature. 
---
M for...
---
*you‚Äôre supposed to be a grown ass adult*
---
So its a time related thing. Any idea how long it takes for them to reapawn?
---
Probably one of the most ridiculous thing I've ever read.
---
For what it's worth I'm really happy with the event overall. I've had a lot of fun, I do it repeatedly, it's a really good direction to see the game go. 
---
I never get visitors to my CAMP, and since I play alone I‚Äôm always just there by myself, going about my tasks.
---
If any of you want to visit me on Xbox sometime, go to Uncanny caverns and follow the road right it front of it to the left, right behind the cemetery. That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find my red house. Make yourself at home, I‚Äôve got... a couch and.... some succulents.
---
This game is an exercise in frustration at times. You have to be a masochist to put yourself through it.
---
Scrapping the helmet automatically gives you the ability to craft it?
---
I'm really happy with the event overall. I've had a lot of fun, I do it repeatedly, it's a really good direction to see the game go. 
---
You know what I suspect happened? You guys accidentally clicked the revenge button the moment you died. It has happened to me in the past. There is no timer after dying, so you can accidentally pick the wrong choice. I use xbox controller, so if I get caught reloading as I die, I seek revenge. If I jump as I die, I ignore the player. There needs to be a five second cooldown after death before you can make a choice.
---
That plan isn‚Äôt hard to come by. I have two 
---
I‚Äôve been looking for one. What‚Äôs your ign?
---
Ah, I didnt know, very cool!
---
Honestly, if they just copied all of the ending credit songs from Mad Men. So good.
---
Just finished compiling 2,500 reports, 160+ mine personally..

[Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup, QoL and Review | Fasnacht Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b4sng6/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_qol_and/)
---
Honestly appears to be akin to playing the Lottery (PowerBall, etc.), with no one in any of the results I have getting a single Uncommon, let alone the Rare.  
---
Not sure quests of this nature, especially limited duration ones, are worth the "grind".
---
24 hours
---
And yet the chill of bugs lingers.
---
Neither is yours. Critical opinions have actually become a rare sight in this subreddit partly because of people like you. Enjoy your echo chamber.
---
I‚Äôve only tried the event for the first time today and got my witch mask from it. There were about 6 other people there and we did it relatively fast. But I swear I saw a high level player with one of the rare masks.
---
Eh whatever, I‚Äôll do it again tomorrow and pray I get something good. 
---
Yeah I noticed something like that, which is why I was hoping other people had different runs we could hit!
---
Hard time believing it myself.
---
I remember when I did something similar. We live and learn, or don't lol.
---
Can you please tell us the location?
---
+karma
---
He wants a rare mask and will give anything for it
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLlw9ypFgkk&amp;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLlw9ypFgkk&amp;t=36s) random youtube video on it. IT has to be a random encounter. solo animal.
---
Moreso I want proof Xbox even has em spawning
---
Real but rarely known as way to many people don't use animal friend. It and wasteland whisperer are good for avoiding fights.
---
So, I read that yes, scrapping it automatically gives you the ability to craft it. And when I scrapped it, that is indeed what happened: the sound cue played, and it popped up in the top left corner that I had unlocked it, and I immediately went and re-crafted another one. 
---
That said, it's not like I've extensively tested it, so there could still be the possibility that it gets scrapped and and the schematic is not learned.
---
Toothy isn't rare.  It's Winter, Sun, Jester, Goblin, Skull.
---
In my opinion they should extend the event by a week and boost the rare mask drop rate to about 10%-25% so that they are rare but not super rare. An item from an event that takes effort to do should not be rarer than a csgo knife from a case. 
---
I ended up farming west tek and it had 4 *** legendarys but not a single 3* drop from them. 
---
2 2* meat hooks. 
---
Spoiler: They won't.
---
Finally ran into it tonight. Started near watoga, walked to Abbie‚Äôs bunker, then to the observatory and then it spawned near the atlas observatory 
---
Luck of the draw ftw
---
To be fair, he's allowed as much of an opinion as you. Just saying
---
It's WanderingWolf15. Feel free to add me if you'd like, but I won't be on again tonight. Hopefully by tomorrow I'll have my "shop" post all ready to go with all the stuff I have, and we can see if we can find an agreeable trade.
---
I‚Äôll be very surprised if anyone even steps up with proof much less puts a price on the mask XD
---
I'm currently working on levelling up for the mutation-related perk cards, and once I have those I'll get in contact with you, if that's alright? I've saved the thread for now! :)
---
Try it without and you'll notice the difference. What weapons are you using?
---
Weapon artisan 
---
Ah, I see youve finally taken to flexing on reddit.
---
No one puts the lid down on the commode!
---
I keep my doors open and everything unlocked so everyone can come by and grab what they want/need.
---
No unfortunately, there is a bug that makes it extraordinarily rare to get one. Kudos to you for getting one though.
---
Have Bloody Mess. :(  
---
The Frozen sloths we've had stop responding to any attacks, tried explosives etc. and where typically the corpse move when you bump into it, the Sloth won't in this State.
---
Yeah it seems bad now but trust it's even worse without. I use weapon artison when I repair so that helps and honestly luck of the draw helps alot too
---
Automatic handmades, AAE and BE I feel these weapons dont get affected by gunsmith beacuse when I look at peoples builds for them they dont even run it...
---
There are fireworks?
---
Yup yup
---
The other door beside the panel opens to some basic scrap/random loot and a space suit along with the space helmet. The code is the release date of Fallout 76 which is also pretty cool
---
I have to admit to doing this, and maybe i'll change it next time i move it, but it's all because of when the game first started, you had to work the camp into the terrain.  So i've kept the basic shape from a BP and just slap it up. Now with the ground times being dissapated when you spawn CAMP items, designs will be more fun.  I just want to keep the freaking Mole rats from attacking my damn crops, so i've got turrets on hanging platforms over them, ergo the single stairway holing up 2 floors above it, like an upside down pyramid.
---
Legendaries are easy to come by... I'd suggest offloading, it's going to be awhile before the vendor comes .
---
This rare mask thing has gotten out of hand. I think a lot of people keep doing it to maybe (if they're really really lucky they might still get one ) I know I do which is probably a bit dumb. Its got to the point where these 'rare' masks would be quite valuable. So if they suddenly showed up in the atomic shop they might sell like hot cakes or whatever.
---
I'm a bit of a collector in real life and this is getting to me. I would like the old man winter one and the sun mask. Maybe the jester one also. The only one I don't care about is the skull one. 
---
But how can you have 5 masks which are common as shit and 5 which are not going to show at all?
---
Why not just make one mask really rare. People want to collect them all over the week and they should be able to.
---
Bad PR from Bethseda ( again ).
---
Honestly? If you're on PS4 and have a mic, I can walk you through it
---
Cool. I‚Äôll add you when I get on next.
---
Lmao so screq gunsmith and just use luck of the draw?
---
I'd agree for the most part. There are a few things I'd change based on how the community handled it. IE: Make the event respawn after 15-20 minutes per server, to decrease the server hopping and instability that has occurred. 
---
Im trading in higher star-ed ones for lower ones as I get 'em
---
Dude I wish I could play fallout 76 that much 
---
I ended up just buying one for like 2k, too much hassle.
---
I have various hats, helmets and outfits. The only one I couldn't get is the clown outfit. Always gome miraclously.  
---
They‚Äôre a waste of ammo. The last time they were a real fight was back when I was level 20-30. 
---
Today, the biggest challenge is getting them to land so you don‚Äôt have to roll the dice with hit detection. 
---
Lol both
---
I‚Äôd better get some caps then.
---
work three jobs and just recently finished college on my own sorry i dont get handouts i live on my own too what do you do? and my fam is gone so anything else you wanna say? hey im welcome to listen
---
Do you have the same receivers on both weapons? Automatic weapons degrade faster
---
I've got 2,500 documented (160 of them mine) completed events, zero uncommon or rare masks.
---
I add doors last to avoid this
---
That's the plan for the bonfire I think not the mask.
---
Ill test out how gunsmith will work beacuse its taking 5 perk alots but when I look at peoples builds there not even using gunsmith lmao
---
I forgot to re-equip gunsmith the other night and my 200% conditioned handmade was broke within 2 hours.
---
Can confirm it didn‚Äôt give me the plan for the marine tactical helmet when I scraped it. 
---
You can‚Äôt balance bad enemy design lol. A full rework would be neccessary to make them a fun and engaging encounter.
---
Lmao 
---
why bother commenting then you seem attacked over nothing its crazy how only one actual person asked a simple question to my post everyone else is just big mad over it instead of just moving on hmmm and so many have said it should go f2p and seeing how they are going about updates so on it seems to be heading that way as they ban ppl that actually put time into a broken game but you know facts are not a thing to you or the others in here getting upset its humorous 
---
Honestly I think the real issue here is that you were one shot at all. I have been 1 shot both in and out of power armor from full health and my opponent wasn‚Äôt even using a bloodied weapon. No PvP system should allow someone to instantly kill their opponent. That just sucks the fun out of PvP. PvP should be about the skill of the players not the rarity of their weapon.
---
I don't even bother with doors. Come on in!
---
If they're melee they have no reason for gunsmith. But the repairs aren't very costly for some people depending on the mats they farm 
---
glad to entertain
---
So gunsmith is useless lmao I have it maxed and it lasts me like legit 5 hours.
---
Was this the cosmetic one or the armor version?
---
I found the cosmetic one a while back but am yet to even see the armor one.
---
I'm constantally updating my camp so this is very annoying to me but thanks for the tip.
---
Wasn't the beta code activated on the bethesda page? With your bethesda account?
---
If you work 3 jobs AND just finished college, with no significant other, that means you have insane disposal income even after student loans.
---
But somehow can't afford a $40 game?
---
"I don't get handouts" &gt; On Reddit begging for a code handout
---
Dumbest shit I've ever heard
---
Once you hit a certain level you'll be rolling in them. Whitesprings can give you six or seven in one run on a good day.
---
I feel handmades for somereason dont really effect by gunsmith to much beacuse, when I have it on it only lasts me maybe a extra hour or 2 compared to If I didnt have it on lol
---
I enjoyed it, I‚Äôve gotten my monies worth but I definitely would prefer the single player grand epic. 
---
oh right i forgot thanks for continually proving with the others in here how toxic this community actually is lol good on you all
---
https://imgur.com/a/mK3oESQ they are still there? And just because they may not be in the Appalachia worldspace, does not mean they arent accessible.
---
Cheatengine lets you fairly easilly reach any cell in the game, some youll have to noclip after to actually get anywhere, others you dont need to.
---
"entirety of falllout community" lmfao i literally stated the 76 community and that is not even a fraction of the fallout community but please go on
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GN8Q27jGOQ&amp;t=776s follow this guide. 22 more stashs. I follow this route. Also thanks for this run. My stash run just got bigger.
---
Theyre both semi-auto however the explosive has a speedy receiver and a 30 round mag so it could be placebo on my end? 
---
I'm worried Bethesda kept the original durability as a way to stick it to the grandfathered weapons. 
---
No it works for them. I alternate between sniper and commando.. Automatic chews up condition pretty fast. Like I said, go on a run with out gunsmith if you want proof.
---
I had to start selling crappy one stars. My alt account still can‚Äôt walk normally with 900+ weight and his stash is maxed. Legendary vendor can‚Äôt come soon enough.
---
I have zero problems with any added content or challenges.  Seems a silly thing to complain about 
---
My favorite thing is timing a TS Mini Nuke MIRV at the horde of enemies coming from the road.
---
Seeing all those stingwings and wolves get one shotted all at once is great. And knowing that I probably saved a robot or two because everyone was tryna get what's usually a 1* legendary is the best.
---
They can have the sloth.
---
I love when I have neighbors! I'm currently on Seneca Falls and though I have had to server jump a few times due to having a (I guess) popular CAMP location, I just met my first neighbor on the second peak today. I need to move though. The amount of times I've died from fast traveling to my CAMP without PA and falling to my death is ridiculous. I'm way to forgetful to live on a mountaintop.
---
yes, im tired of the repertoire.  
---
thought rose would have some tunes, nope just banter.  
---
bugged me with the fact that they took old music, and shoved it in with new music.  
---
but oh well..
---
Also can you message me if you got the paint. Because me and you are in the same boat. So I hope I will eventually get it.
---
South of the Chinese palace place lol
---
Alright ill try it tommorw for sure, im sure gunsmith does something but dont think its worth all 5 points. 
---
Drones following what their YouTube idols regurgitate.
---
Thinking for yourself is a dying notion thanks to internet/social media.
---
Durability of ballistic weapons is all dependant on how fast the bullets the fly out of the barrel, and how many actually land on a mob. Bullets fired into the air don't actually degrade your weapon.
---
yes i work three jobs think if i had the money id waste my time asking even though codes are being thrown out every day lol why pay for something if i can get it for free, common sense guy and no i pay rent a car the stuff i need to live my small apartment and the few necessities i can afford not everyone going to college has the time or luxury to get everything all i got is a laptop and futon in my apartment but hey your right lmfao id easily go over the friends house too that i played at but they moved outta the country so meh 
---
PS4 player, I can't help. But if you don't want to farm, try participating in the scorchbeast queen event.  
---
You will be awarded some stabilazed flux at random.   
---
wanna keep trying to bring more assumptions of someone you dont know on a post you coulda easily ignored or just said no or ask why i couldnt get it? nah you went and got big mad about it yet it doesnt affect you at all www
---
So does that mean explosive degrade quicker because they hit more than one target in one go? (Theoretically) 
---
Also would a beam splitter effect that because you have multiple beams? 
---
Is that even in the loot table?
---
Thanks, I've tried 30 minutes between milking the Brahmin 8n flatwoods but it doesn't always work.
---
One issue is plague walker really annoys them - they keep kicking me.
---
My brother and I farm a lot of Tech data. We‚Äôve turned in hundreds. Enough to get Knight Paint x 3 and Knight CPT x 4. I haven‚Äôt seen any other paint confirmed drop myself.  I see people offering to paint armor but never seen the plans themselves.
---
Where is this message? Where is the proof he duped? Can you guys link it ere?
---
Are u on ps4 ? Have yet to see anyone on ps4 with this so I doubt it
---
Can you link the proof he duped?
---
You can get away without using sometimes.. Especially if you're being a sneaky sniper. Or if you're just doing a quick run, like clearing West Tek. 
---
It‚Äôs been open since launch, but yeah it‚Äôs an awesome feature 
---
Hmm?
---
Yeah I run a stealth commando build with a BE handmade that junk is op lmao.
---
Agreed, I've only ever had my camp attacked once by another player, never found out who it was though.  Greifers and such are just the worst.  My last Parade event, some dude spammed power armour chassis on the bridge and we couldn't finish the event....once it did finish everyone unloaded on him,
---
I don't know about Explosive, but the beam splitter definitely degrades a weapon faster.
---
No one on PS4 that I've seen so far has any of the rare masks, I have all five common masks, the old man summer from atom shop and the beret.
---
Either find some friends ingame or play the game head on with friends and it will be a blast.
---
I gave up on having a pet Brahmin because mine kept dying all the damn time.
---
I wonder if it's possible to put it in an enclosed space so mobs/people can't get to it? I never really tried...I think the item has to be placed in dirt so that's the only thing that would limit you...
---
Same for me man, 2600bottlecaps and no beret.
---
That explains it partly, I'll switch it to a beam focused. Do you think I should do a sniper barrel over the standard? Help slow it down a bit, maybe switch to a slower capacitor 
---
Im the guy who ran the poll for the masks. [Here is the final data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1110pDvFD_nQZ7LDnQq-EAiUHHOxX2p7-RoXf-5KglgI/edit#gid=1722529806) if anyone wants it.
---
Green = new confirmed mask
---
Yellow = duplicate confirmed mask
---
red = troll
---
Keep in mind confirmed is up to you, it just means we have a picture. Whether it was obtained legitimately or not, I leave to you.
---
And that is why survival mode is going to be hell, imagine someone with unyielding, sentinel, and strength full set with faster swing speed bloodied weapon good luck having a fair fight with that duper.
---
Brooooo, I know I'm the same Everytime I go to drop or remove 1 it hurts to attempt to throw them away
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Sc2xLsZbtE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Sc2xLsZbtE) found a better video with a full list of tamable animals. 
---
It is. Yes
---
I kind of want the event to be over with just so I can run into random players somewhere besides Helvetia.
---
But I know for sure paladin and elder exist. I seen people sell it.
---
Until CAMP protections kick in IF this happens again,  move your CAMP,  don't try to repair or store anything.
---
Move your CAMP and everything will be repaired.   You can move it back again afterwards.
---
Interesting...
---
That is absolutely not a feature to take away. Its apart of the game for a reason and advertised it as such. You and the people you come across create your story and experience. However I'd be totally down if they took your camp off the map entirely except for you. Or maybe allow that to be a setting you can toggle. 
---
Late, but grab the Healing Factor Mutation and the Sun Kissed and Photosynthetic Perk Cards. Never rely on consumables again.
---
Are you kidding? Deathclaws are the best! They're so cute when they run on all fours and then the toothy smiles too! Sooo ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I never bought in in the first place as I've yet to do it. The rewards aren't that interesting for me personally.
---
I get why others might be into it but just not for me. 
---
Hahah I know. I have a simple 1* bloodied lever action... Don't even need the explosive, most things die in one shot lol.
---
No. It's been confirmed.
---
I can confirm you can‚Äôt get the plan twice once you‚Äôve learned the plan. Maybe we‚Äôve shout ourselves in the foot and can‚Äôt get passed CPT because we won‚Äôt learn it? Gonna eat it and find out
---
Have done the event countless times and my charisma is at 30 with unyielding and full charisma points and no difference. I have sat for a whole day even playing the event continuously and neither have I seen anyone else with these rare masks. I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
I think you should play the way that's the most fun for you :)
---
As I said, the slow the gun the greater the durability will be. With that in mind just tweak your build to where you find it fun without being overly grindy.
---
I'm getting onto 80 also and I feel like giving up, but I keep having this "what if" thought come over me. What have you done Bethesda!? xD
---
I can't even find a fasnacht event to spawn anymore, so its kinda easy to forget about the event overall sheesh.
---
I've noticed it to. But not in workshops 
---
Hm. I have the option to make a video of the last 2 minutes I was playing. If I ever were to acuire a mask I'd save that video as proof.   
---
Perks playing on ps4.  
---
If you have a mic I‚Äôll run with you. You can tag enemies and do events and stuff with me.
---
Or use VATS
---
People got dupes of knight I think and maybe paladin?? They could of had a alt-account. The plans I already learned are
---
*Iniate
---
*Knight
---
*knight captain 
---
*knight sergeant 
---
*officer
---
Just need two more paints that are in the game and in done!
---
Also good farm spot for ant meat if you are quicker than the deathclaw.
---
Depends what elements your camp is using. I've gotten the 'item is floating' error often since the last patch. Had to rebuild every time.
---
More beach boys
---
I'd do that trade
---
Finally!
---
Yes I‚Äôve got multiple knights and CPT as I chose not to learn the plan right away thinking it didn‚Äôt matter in advancing to the next level... maybe it does matter?
---
Indigoshade29 on xbox 1 msg me im on right now
---
Gt watchmefly420 
---
Lol watch them make that mask an atom shop item 1k. Dam that looks cool.
---
Yep. I was amazed when i first stumbled across it but that quickly turned to disappointment when i realised there was very little of interest there.
---
No idea where the leg is lol, but I'm blind and need glasses so maybe I'm not the best shot
---
Ok I'm at work now and won't be off for a while I'll add you. 
---
Even vats wasn't working for a friend of mine, sometimes the quest gets glitched 
---
Weapon artisan to repair 200%. And I feel it depends o.n the gun. My lever is a once a day deal. My laser rifle is the same unless I feel like using it more. 
---
It would make no sense to have to start a new character in survival. In a month when people are level 50+ with good gear they will annihilate all new players and noone new will join survival. People will need to grow their players before joining survival.
---
If we could move doors while in camp mode like in 4 it would be fine but as of now its just a pain
---
I really don't think you know what you're talking about. Melee characters don't use sentinel. They can't do ranged attacks, so they need to move. And secondly, these people are really easy to kill if you know anything about PvP. 
---
Whoo ok. Might have to be tomorrow. Its 3 am for me. Lol
---
Same here 
---
I would like to point out that I‚Äôm not talking about the marine tactical helmet; that one is the wetsuit like mask, with the big bug eyes. I‚Äôm talking about the armor helmet. 
---
This is not to say that your point about the possibility of not getting the plans upon scrapping is invalid, just wanted to point out that they were different things.
---
Unless their license was for the franchise.
---
The terms of the license are part of the contract, they could have an extended license for all games in the Fallout franchise.
---
Should of thought about that. But I seen people already learned a plan and they would have the paint but in a opposite order of what you said. Also o just want to learn the plans as soon As I get my hands on them.
---
The longest ribbon on thr right is touching the shoe. A blue shoe. 
---
Government stamp duty is a real bitch. 
---
Also, where did you buy it?
---
The rare masks are the friends we made along the way 
---
I didn't even get a mask last time. Nor was I able to shoot the sloth. Total waste of time for me. I probably won't do it again.
---
I am not entirely sure. I‚Äôm inclined to say that it is the armor one, but I didn‚Äôt actually look to see if putting it on boosted and of my armor stats. I know it definitely gave me a -2 to perception however. Next time I‚Äôm on I‚Äôll take a look and get back to you. 
---
And i see people exploding the cars all the time when the bots are nearby.
---
I want bos for my combat armour. Where do I find that??
---
I just tested this and learned SGT after eating CPT. So you may not advance to the next plan without eating the current one. You can however collect multiples of the current one to sell if you have that much TD.
---
That exact scenario happened to me. Total dicks
---
Swimming in some ponds will let you see some single fish in the environment as well.
---
I run with a crew and we're brotherhood themed so I'm trying to use advanced energy weapons and you know try to have the technical knowledge to advise other members of the crew and our friends. I'll probably try and slow it down, I don't want to invest too many resources testing out different configurations for it. Thank you for your help friend!
---
The one laying on top of the cabinet? YES!!
---
Nah, its just a weird log
---
Yeah, if you are connected to the internet then it automatically backs up your save to the cloud file (not sure if it's at set times or whenever there's a change). So there's one "plus", at least if you get back into XB1 (even a new console) all your saves and digital games will be right there on your account.
---
Sorry man, but no. I‚Äôm on PC. 
---
Did you light the bonfire by going up to it and activating it?  I see loads of players shooting it, tossing grenades or Molotov‚Äôs, or just standing back waiting 
---
Faction based flags, and posters like Enclave or BoS propaganda posters would be cool
---
Nope, hats overal don't have stats. Only mask may have protection agains diseazes and negative perception.
---
Lots of junk in Excavators and a ton of useless 1\* legendaries and weapons.
---
Yeah, I had not heard the news. Thanks man. 
---
You're sleepy
---
You can only get one TD at a time. So what you tested shows there‚Äôs a pattern. After captain you gain SGT and after SGT you get officer. Not how much TD do I need in order to reach Paladin and then elder???
---
I figured as such. Thought maybe there was two versions.  Still boggles my mind why they don‚Äôt for 76
---
/u/valseek said it would end 6am edt
---
A lot? Unless your lucky? I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a specific number
---
Im going to bed *yawn* night lol
---
The more i look at it I see shoe laces. What if it's old man winter! What if we choose not to light the fire
---
I suggested this way back at launch and was called crazy and stupid. 
---
Although I had two zones one for deathmatches. And one for social stuff, trading, hanging out. 
---
But whatevs still a good idea. 
---
I was pretty lucky today actually. I got the captain plan, SGT plan and then officer in a single day and I got them with too much time apart. I think there‚Äôs a pattern there has to be!
---
Oh shit you right, there is definitely a leg attached to it. Maybe it's Todd Howard? Does he wear blue shoes?
---
Probably be tomorrow around 4 or 5pm not sure how long tho. Hit me up here when you get on and I'll let you know how long I'll be.
---
Ha I'm not crazy! Verified! Ok going to bed
---
Sigh, I lost most in a scrapping incident, I love starting over though! 
---
No problem thanks.
---
Never fear! I‚Äôm going to start to take up the serum part on ps4, inspired by this lovely lad :)

It‚Äôs gotten bad since the new event drops so many mini-nukes. It‚Äôs mini-nuke camp month apparently.
---
[Your post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3r5hr/fasnacht_mask_drop_rate_poll_results/) is what inspired me to do this, I didn't doubt your method, just know that polls can be tricky when dealing with outside influences. 
---
By pulling data from either sources I knew I could trust, could witness / experience myself it allowed me to rule out the chance of "bad data" from those either refusing to show the mask, griefers or who could have gotten it from less than legit means.  
---
I've got 0/2,500...  
---
You've got 3/9308 (including Uncommon and Rare).  
---
It reinforces your conclusions with controlled data, the fact the chance of an Uncommon, to say nothing of a Rare, is astronomically low.   
---
In the end I don't think "Uncommon" means the same to us as it does to BGS...
---
He becomes old man nuclear winter
---
I never understood destroying other camps, everyone is playing the same game. its pathetic
---
OHHHH, i gotchu. Wink wink üòâ 
---
If you take any workshop, people can contest it and flag everyone on your team as hostile. This extends to structures and they can destroy them without getting a bounty. It seems like you don't understand the rules for PvP, but in short, just don't claim the workshops if you don't want to get rolled up. Don't be on a team with anyone that owns a workshop. Avoid workshop ownership
---
The bodies get blown in the air most of the time so you would have to search for them.
---
I see myself playing this game for a good while to come, and I don‚Äôt usually have a lot of time to play during the week and exploit the cap and junk farming, so I‚Äôm stockpiling the common masks I get to sell to newbies later on. It‚Äôs the only way they‚Äôll ever get them otherwise, I get some caps/junk and they get a cool mask. Win win
---
There's also a high likelihood they got rebanned. I guess it's just people who are getting ready for survival mode that are trying to see what PvP is like
---
What if just a theory that BGS will just give us all these masks if you completed the parade come Tuesday when the event ends.. not so rare then

Watoga check the tables   Always find a selection of different beers and boiled water on the picnic tables

I‚Äôll sell you a couple mutations! All you need :) if you are on ps4 that is, 150c each.

If you didn‚Äôt know the old bug where you could place almost any item in you camp without the actual plan learnt is back! :)
---
A little down the road into Helvetia from the North East is my bar; "Mothman Bar and Grill". It also means my buildings and defences are far enough away to not kill the Sloth immediately nor do I get in the way of people looking for eggs. 
---
Anyone who pops in can be given free alcohol. I make a lot of the stuff, or feel free to brew your own. Over the last few days Helvetia has actually felt alive. Our own little settlement. I'm going to be a little sad once I start seeing less of you all again.

Was it today cause I had problems with Biv. Wouldn't talk to me all day till around 11 to which he gave me two quests with the same ingredients

Speed demon has been wonky... It seems like it's working correctly with everything except weapon reload

Oh man this is harder than Where's Wally.

Why not do it yourself?

If you're on PS4, I believe I have a couple in my inv
---
What?
---
Is it even clear how the system will work? Maybe it is a daily quest where you only can reforge one item per day or it will cost some bottle caps. 
---
I had one in 30 runs

Longest ribbon on the right touches the blue shoe. Turn your brightness up and you should see a leg from the blue shoe

You're on PC and they're from the Dev room.

And that is why I never accept invites to team. If you want to follow, fine, but we don't have to team. I play more as Lone Wanderer anyway.

There is indeed a person in there.  The one you can build at your camp has the legs more visible.

I am always afraid to use someone‚Äôs camp. I feel like I am invading or I am gonna get shot at.

I don't see it but that might be because my account is still the old name. I'll keep checking it 
---
I don't know really. Planned on going to bed not to long from now and didn't know if I was up to a solo run through the silo right this second
---
We can't get foolproof evidence? I haven even been looking and just from shit ending up on my front page I've seen people with the old man winter, devil and merman masks. 
---
Looking for a an actual Bethesda response to masks not dropping would put my mind to easy, if not a hint to the community on how to obtain them would be more than fair as well.
---
On the roof I think. There is a note somewhere.
---
For 40 atom rewards it is lame that these are still broken, considering you have to play the game for 700 plus hours to get 20 atoms. I made an Alt character &amp; tried to visit my last two locations, 1 worked but then the last bugged out. Do I need to make a 3rd character &amp; hope for the best. This has been broken since launch, sort of ridiculous. 
---
I have a beret. If you want it, it's yours. PM your username and we'll meet up when you're on.
---
Just a heads up, you don't actually need the codes in your inventory to launch a nuke. You just need the decoded numbers!
---
100% acknowledged. It was a test. I noticed what was in my stash was different and tried anyway. 
---
Just had some kid raging because we didn't let two of the robots die. He said something like, "Guys! I'm level 200 something. I think I know what I'm talking about!". When players start acting like this right out of the gate I make it my personal mission to protect those sweet baby robots lol.
---
So we kill small animals for thier intestines, play random music to a odd song, gather random ingredients: eggs and honey.
---
What are we actually doing? Are we really the good guys and girls.
---
It's like you didn't read the post.
---
One of my Camps had a solotary locked room with "private" above the door.
---
It was filled with traps and turrets.
---
I have a theory that if a robot is wearing one of the 'rare' masks while parading, you sacrifice him for a shot at scoring it. It's not guaranteed and if you let one die, you might not get any masks. I have yet to find anyone willing to test this with me during a parade
---
I have an extra sausage recipe if you can get me a donut one!

I can find some for you. Send me a PM if you still need help. My timezone is GMT+1.

2. SHHH! That's a great location for.. reasons. And I don't need copycats in my life lol.

I dont care, I was one of those hermits playing solo and this event has got me to come out of my shell for awhile.
---
Thanks for that info! I've never encountered the other two so I didn't realize that was actually the case.
---
You wouldn't happen to have a spare flag pole (not the mounted one) would you? I've got extra sausages to trade. GT: SymbolicGamer
---
It mentions scraping legendary items so I'm not sure
---
Oh they exist, but I‚Äôm convinced all the ones were seeing are dev room accessed, I want to see a video of it dropping on the event popup 
---
Prove it
---
I don't like thinking that it's a possibility, but they did it with other cosmetics like the vampire outfit.
---
I mean, it just started like two hours ago. I was server hopping trying to get the civil war hat plan, and after one of the logins my camp just didn‚Äôt show up. No message saying it couldn‚Äôt be placed or anything. I can just move it for free now. And I spent so much time working on it...
---
Only can sell to fellow players. Can not scrap or sell to in game vendors.
---
I think I meant devil. It's all sharp teeth.

---
Yeah, that's what I called Goblin.  I've heard it called that, but no idea if it's official.
---
76 uses a global economy which would hyper inflate very quickly if we could sell ammo. So we cant. 
---
Think how I‚Äôm previous games you‚Äôd pick up all the ammo and you‚Äôd sell it to fill out your caps at the vendor, which effectively breaks the economy of the wasteland. 
---
Looks like the "FO76 comments bingo" never gets old as long as you look for the phrases about "Beth liars" , "buggy FO76" and "I am trading in".
---
That's too much of an overreaction. 
---
"all i got is a laptop and futon in my apartment"

Then why as6l for a console code...

Also if this is just to review the game go back to the same friends house and play for a few hours.

This whole thread should be cross posted to r/choosingbeggars
---
I legit thought this guy wanted someone with a Silo Code.
---
I don‚Äôt do cap runs, but my main‚Äôs camp is above Blackwater mine which has 2 stashes, and every time I‚Äôm in the area I also hit up the Enclave bunker for the 2 on/in there as I check the enclave vendor for x-01 mods. It‚Äôs a nice bit of efficiency.  
---
What weapon have you tried with bloody mess? Its frozen about half the time for me. And it will only explode if I use a melee weapon on it and hit about 15 to 20times. .

Either way, that one.

Only one I really want is Sun, but oh well, I like the Owl one a lot.

The bunker doors tied to a different event, presidential election something or another

i could have sworn it has to do with the type of roof you use... like if its cloth or it has holes-rain will get in. i noticed this in fo4 tho... maybe im giving bethesda too much credit tho lol

Fix for the sloth freezing and being unlootable is to fast travel away and back again. Worked for me twice.

Any time someone has "low health" presume they're a bloody. You entered PvP, and are unhappy you died? Because you thought he was going to be an "easy kill"? Bud. lol.

The shack you made for him was way smaller than I thought lol It is a good story but I smell madness.
---
Had about 15 ppl on friday do one, i was annoyed that it were so many because you couldnt shoot anything in time :/
---
No. The devs themselves have said that you have a higher chance of a mask if all robots are alive. It has also been datamined that you have a higher chance of getting a mask if all the robots are alive.
---
at the beginning a bunch of waiters would try to get to you at once or a bunch of them would glitch out behind a door. its was a mess lol 
---
Toothy is super common i have 3 or so.
---
Yes, haven't find it elsewhere.
---
You don't know what "rare" means, do you.
---
&gt; put the "Rare" masks in the Atomic Shop for free at the end of the event.
---
A "canvas bag" sized mis-step.
---
It‚Äôs going to be fine. Relax.
---
Wait... how did they cheat? It sounds like you just got killed a bunch by a min max user to me, I'm not seeing the part where he/she cheated.
---
Thanks understand 
---
I'm sorry that sucks.
---
anytime, and welcome.
---
I've given up on the rare masks at this point, I just want a damn beret and donut recipe. I have everything else, it's killing me lol

nice, always good to have a backup plan.

PC: Shielded lining for BOS underarmor
---
It caps at 400% 
---
The amount of downvotes you‚Äôre getting is probably from salty players
---
Oh thank god
---
sweet thank for the tip
---
Double damage should the cap. Should hit harder than a tse at max fury.

If I‚Äôm wrong the cap might be at 2.5x damage.

I made the suggestion that they could sell some of the radio stations from other fallouts like new vagas radio and stuff

Convincing players to fist fight with me, and then turning said players into a fine red mist with one punch

idk if this is because of the event or what. but there is a stash at the parade event that had 100caps. most ive ever seen-no perks. i havent tried to go back to it again. 
---
Lol I know. Just at the time I was a low level and never had any spare junk.
---
Must say I find your videos informative. I genuinely bought 76 because of a video you did... A video on the biggest and maybe best patch, there were negative but plusses and throughout your videos you've been right so I went out and got it. 
---
YAAAAAAAAS!
---
I could swear the donut recipe and beret are more rare than the others but I've played probably half as many times as you so I guess I just have to up my rookie numbers, 2 more days!
---
Oh, this is fantastic. Hell, make the Mole Miner heavy breathing noise and really mess with someone. 
---
You wot mate 
---
We give up on these issues for this reason and it is going to be in caps:
---
BETHESDA DO NOT CARE.
---
Do you know the exact name of the plan? I‚Äôm just hopping on now and it seems the spare ones I got as of now are: balloons and confetti pile.
---
I have the forest hat not outfit though....
---
It most certainly still rains indoors. So no we can't appreciate that fact.
---
And then you killed and ate him again right?
---
Bethesda need to admit a LOT more than some stupid mask drop rate issue.
---
Im on One X and it doesnt look soaking wet when im inside my camp building.
---
I love t60 
---
I'm pretty sure this isn't the best place to sell things aside from serums and PA mods. I believe there is discords relating to trading (or maybe even trading websites) that would be a better option but honestly my knowledge is minimal on this topic.
---
Heavy Robot Chest/Arms plans?
---
This is a very good suggestion, but probably unneeded: It's a vividly memorable location in an otherwise underutilized area of the map, and the resources already developed in making it that way are almost certainly an investment for future content ‚Äî quests, events, etc. If by some remote chance they aren't already planning to follow your advice, though, I hope they'll notice it here and follow it.
---
The whole thing is a waste of time.  I showed up for the quest, shot a couple things, then took a shit and when I came back I had an owl mask.  Same with the liquor quests.  A fetch quest with no teeth.  Can we get some high level friendly stuff please? 
---
I have close to 200 hours and have never seen a rad storm while playing.
---
No I read the post fine. Just hilarious that people are complaining and asking Bethesda for help. 
---
That‚Äôs not what this person posted. But I also don‚Äôt feel bad for you. Leave the world. 
---
I‚Äôm a bloodied melee and I‚Äôm easy to kill. If I‚Äôm fighting someone who knows how to pvp it‚Äôs gunna be a hard fight. But in all honesty most of the people I see pvping suck. 
---
Hiding small letters in their camp to fuck with their budget limits
---
I could've used you about 2 weeks ago. Couldn't take a workbench without being attacked and no one would sell me any. Got lucky with a random drop with a bunch of 70% cores during a whitesprings nuke event.
---
Does that even work?  I've never gotten it to hit. 
---
If you don't want your water taken, put locks on the purifiers. 
---
I keep 2 Industrial at my camp and lock one. So anyone can take the unlocked one but I always have my own in reserve. 
---
They‚Äôve nerfed TSE. A lot. 
---
But I would say if you don‚Äôt want to fight those guys, don‚Äôt go into that mode. 
---
Not sure why this is such a big deal. They will probably be in the atom shop soon 
---
I feel like a lot of ppl who play Bethesda games like to collect all the different things unique in game, having an item that its almost impossible to get via random drop is a bit of a slap in the face 
---
I don't use doors.
---
I have a level 40 anti armour hunting rifle if you want to trade
---
I completely agree! I am a jubilant parade marcher, I particularly love the bee keeper!
---
Especially hearing him go "bzzzzz" in the protectatron voice. That gets me every time.
---
I hope that Bethesda can find it in their hearts, to bring the "rare masks" to more of the community.
---
Particularly to those putting in the long hours.
---
What do you want from it?
---
Came here to say this.  
---
Hopefully they have plans for it down the road. My personal hopes are:
---
\- 4-man (full group) dungeon with alien theme behind the locked door. Zetans that was invading the station when it crashed have survived by using hybrid technology and the Flatwoods monsters are their hybrid-scouts, thus the strange look of the Flatwoods monster compared to normal Zetans.
---
\- Alien Power Armored boss comes out when the place is Nuked for alternative Nuke Boss fight.
---
Not related to the Fasnacht event, but this is a new One I've noticed. 
---
When I try to take Artillery Grenades out of my Artillery box, I can't remove them. So now that they've fixed the range on the artillery, it's useless again because I can't get any smoke grenades to pinpoint a strike. 
---
Yeah, I never thought much of typical wait staff dialogue they have. I was blown away when they actually waited on me like a legit guest. 
---
You are right. I painted with a broad brush and apologize.  It's the hunting packs or some solo players simply farming caps from players repeatedly I'm worried about not you guys. We'll see what happens.  Bethesda should be given credit for their fantastic new content and the expectation is that this will continue. This is Beta after all, so very tight control should be seen in this new mode and it's impact on the existing PVE server.  I don't expect BSG to allow super muder weapons on the level of the original TSE insanity so it's probably more how they one or two shot people or what gives them the most xp etc.. With the backpack addition you'll see more people want to do without power armor and become more stealthy (me included) that will definitely make things more interesting. So I'll just go chill out let BSG do their thing. Thanks for the perspective.
---
Not gonna like, they had us in the first half.
---
you mean all the acid junk and lead locations near it ;)
---
What a victim blaming poopants.
---
I'm all for respecting the grind but your health is more important than a game
---
Thanks you!  And I would love to have you brew up some mixed drinks for me.  Only a couple days until that challenge ends and I have had just no luck unlocking mixed drinks with the daily quests.
---
I can‚Äôt remember sadly but I‚Äôm willing to pay for your time.
---
Anyone try scrapping the common masks? I dunno. Grasping at straws.
---
üò≤
---
I would pay good money for a Space themed DLC!
---
Those of us who played mothership Zeta im sure agree.
---
Well, the datamining guy did make assumptions on what some of the number were and meant, and since some (very few) people have gotten masks his assumptions were obviously wrong. Yes, the drop rate is ridiculously low, but so are drop rates for many other things in this game.
---
Awesome! I have, but never have the patience to use, the caps-stash homing perk, and frankly haven't previously paid much attention to noticing and remembering them.
---
But with this much detail ‚Äî in, as you point out, an area that there are other reasons to make part of a daily run (probably in conjunction with my daily run past each faction of vendor) ‚Äî I'm certainly going to give this run a try. Thanks very much!
---
What does cryptid/sheepsquatch mean? I ask humbly.
---
You sure? I bought mine in Watoga it‚Äôs not available there? I got it pre vendor change but I thought I saw it still available there
---
Do we know if the chosen decorations could affect the chances of specific masks dropping?
---
Can confirm the Forest outfit exists, I actually just sold it on the market recently. The only one I want is the blue but I'm still hunting for it 
---
10-25% chance is not rare, it is at best uncommon. I have done the event close to hundred times now (have 96 common masks in my stash at this point), and if they had that drop rate I would have had between 9-24 "rare mask at this point. That would have made them way, way to common. No, maybe a small boost, but nothing as high as that.
---
The only bases I destroy are whitesprings turrent farms and known griefers. They fit that last category if your on xbox and if you have their GTs I'll level both of their bases and send you the video.
---
Does the helmet give disease/rad resistance?
---
Don't forget the porcelain steins, worth 4 caps a piece with rank 1 barter perk. 100 plus times no rare masksüôÅ
---
Does charisma affect drop rates?
---
really ? I just checked it and it didn't show up for me :p
---
Edit. According to the wiki page
---
It's a Quest reward for completing¬†Event: Scorched Earth.
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:_Decontamination_Shower

A Leather Plague Doctor mask that comes in more than one color (black, brown, Brownish-tan, tan and red and however many more idc) and keeps you safe from airborn diseases like the veil and includes matching overcoats.

Here is a good example of the mask I am talking about:  [https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/60340539/plague-doctors-mask-in-brownish-tan](https://www.etsy.com/au/listing/60340539/plague-doctors-mask-in-brownish-tan)   
---
It does not have a filter like a gas mask so it wouldn't protect you from radiation. Though perhaps they can have a slight fire resistant stat bonus or there can be an elite version (exterior lined with kevlar) that has a greater fire resistance stat and has its own matching overcoat made out of kevlar or nomex for an even greater fire resistance stat.   
---
Oh and it should include a metal cane that can be used as a weapon, when it is equipped you grip the bottom so that the double spiked handle is what strikes the enemy and has a puncture effect.  
---
The fireman suit and Plague doctor suit should eliminate the damage over time from bloatfly larva - though the initial impact of the bloatfly projectiles should still do damage for challenge sake just minus the damage over time effect.  
---
I would also like the weapons from the let's get medieval mod from FO4 to be in FO76.   
---
OH and a way to SELL ammo or at least trade it in for other things.
---
Everybody gangsta until Mr Testiggles main rocks up. 
---
T-60 has near identical physical reduction as X-01. You want more reduction? Go with T-51b. It has more than 50 physical reduction than both T-60 and X-01.
---
Also, high ROF weapons usually have lower damage per projectile. That makes them worse at penetrating thick armour. Tank Killer perk card can help with that a bit. Or finding a heavy gun with AA legendary effect can add to that.
---
When you die in PvP you lose the amount of caps equal to your level (which would be 77 in this case) 
---
Wait, what? I've done the event about 50 times, not once has a robot died. Is this not common or something?
---
Since they both are explosive then the only difference is the prefix. AA ignores 50% of your opponents armor while TS is more like +25% damage after the nerf. If you‚Äôre gonna PvP then AAE hands down, if you‚Äôre more interested in PvE I‚Äôd recommend an instigating weapon. AA will be better for enemies like super mutants that have a higher DR.
---
Some of those were from the dev room.
---
Been wearing that suit and helmet since I got it around level 6. Haven‚Äôt come across another player that wears it. 
---
Yeah I‚Äôm 100% I never got it from the SBQ (You can get it from her), I bought mine though. I‚Äôm almost positive it was in Watoga but could have been Harper‚Äôs Ferry. Couldn‚Äôt have been Graham because only time I saw him I was level 10 and was cap broke and everything was unaffordable 
---
Yeah. That part of CB has plenty of violet, too.
---
They are probably the commanders of there group and giving orders 
---
I did something like this when they took a work shop from me. They gotta learn not to fuck with other people for no reason. 
---
I‚Äôm PvE only.
---
My favorite mod for FO4 besides darker nights and better flashlights was true storms. You could set the chance frequency and they looked amazing!
---
If you or OP want one built I can do it for you if you have the flux for it and play on Xbox
---
I wanted it to end by you giving him stuff so that you could Rob him, I really thought that was where the story was going..guess not...just me though? lol
---
Wallpaper would make such a mass difference in your interior appearance. It's one of the largest changes in terms of the effect it would have. I want it desperately...
---
Usually they're associated with the Lode Bearing event becoming available in the Ash Heap
---
Floor decorations (fairly sure). Available instantly, may show the vault boy gnome as first in group and youll have to scroll
---
Idk if you‚Äôre biased but you‚Äôre definitely out of touch with what most people are using in PvP. It‚Äôs gonna be AAE and BE to the dome all day 24/7. Personally I hope it stays the way Bethesda‚Äôs introducing it, we can bring our character fully kitted over whenever we want and then go back to adventure mode. 
---
Maybe do some trading and get a good weapon so you don‚Äôt feel so outclassed? I mean there‚Äôs a trading function in this game for a reason..  they‚Äôre also making some balance changes so my advice is to try it out before you try to change it.
---
Nah
---
Epic.
---
Work. Grindr. Sleep. 
---
This post is so funny. When you cry to u/emmerlynn in Apex Legends because you couldn‚Äôt handle 3s. 
---
That other guy is right. You must be super fun at parties. 
---
U/emmerlynn please help this fat fuck. 
---
Where do you store the downloads? I thought you had to have them stored wherever you're playing the  playlist?
---
I'm totally down to farm it, I've already been and I'm aiming to sell my extra plans and recipes from it anyways, good rates and I'm your guy
---
Hmm ill have to look again. I went to floor decor thinking itll be with the busts and it wasnt there. I'll give it a few more mintues then look again.
---
The decorating with junk supposedly could be coming out the same time as player vending or the new camera system, which is April 9th to April 16th. I wasn't put in with the roadmap, but in another post they included it in with one of those 2 things, and I believe it was with player vending.
---
when wanted, map will not show player icons so it is somewhat hard to find other players and camps.
---
You monster.
---
I think I‚Äôm only missing these plans https://imgur.com/gallery/qLniJ1j
---
i use a VE .50 cal a lot (Vampire's Explosive 2\*) its one of my favorite weapons. but then again vampire's works best on automatic weapons IMO
---
&gt;!i also run fireproof to avoid blowing myself up, i can outheal my own self damage at close range when a ghoul wants to shove my barrel in their nose!&lt;
---
There is likely something coming n the cryptid DLC with Wild Appalachia. Want to say it was last month someone blew up the roadmap pictures which saw map locations marked in one pic with the Space station being one of the marked areas.
---
Definitely a person there ))
---
You can see both legs 
---
Thank you for this bit of lore :))
---
AAE/BE and Melee Far outclass TSE's now. They were nerfed hard a while back.
---
Is this a console story? I see a pattern of griefer stories coming from console gamers.
---
Servers were honestly a lot better until the last patch, someone messed some code up and it‚Äôs been a step backwards since. You just have to understand that dying in this game isn‚Äôt like dying in other fallouts, there‚Äôs no real penalty so sometimes taking as many enemies with you before you go is the best way. 
---
You need to get a legendary weapon you like and the game will be much easier. Also make sure you invest in damage perks early on, what‚Äôs your build? Rifles? Melee? Other?
---
Yah
---
Bloody Mess against the sloth corpse will make it lootable. Please update, this isn't even comprehensive.
---
I saw someone post the other week with a great answer. They said it's how they keep alive. They didn't get to be legendary stars by fighting every battle üòÇ 
---
Fucking love that guy. I'm way too impatient to explore every corner of Fallout like he has. 
---
the guy could have been using anti armor perks, vats criticals. chems. etc. 
---
anything to give him an edge in PVP
---
Some say yes some say no but I personally feel it depends on the drop. Say you would get stimpscks from an event and normally you‚Äôd get 1 but with higher charisma you‚Äôd get 2. That‚Äôs the way I see it I don‚Äôt really believe it effects the Fasnacht event in any way.
---
This happened to me. Two guys were just sat perfectly still, one with a bounty and one without. I could kinda see what was about to happen once I claimed the bounty, and I couldn't resist, so went for it. The non bounty guy immediately one shot me.
---
I spent the next 10 minutes hunting them down and claiming all their junk, then server swapped. Actually came out with more caps and junk than I started with.
---
Thank you! üòä
---
Anyone care to explain what this means?
---
If you can‚Äôt handle TSE builds you‚Äôre doing something wrong. It is not a big deal and you should stop complaining.
---
Nothing that is available ingame has been available in the atom shop and vice versa. There isn't a single case of this. People keep repeating this shit when it's simply not going to happen.
---
Thank you very much. I glad you like it üòä
---
Thats my thought. As I felt them in the more and in toxic valley. I also thought it was the SB moving in the fissures. 
---
If Bethesda thinks these mask are obtainable than I want at least one, but still have been gring and no rare mask I'll be sleeping all day Wednesday. I half blam fallout and half me being stubborn cuz I'm also playing with friends but at the cost of being half dead and not speaking clearly. üëç
---
Thank you. üòä
---
Okay, but you're also saying they should cripple the rad suits also, because their radiation resistance is so high it blocks 99% of all radiation
---
He bought as many for 400 as he had caps? Oof
---
I checked it yesterday cause I was in a discussion with another redditor and I have absolutely no problem. The reload speed is still super fast for me and nothing did change. Guess I‚Äòm lucky.
---
Thanks! I glad you like it üòä
---
For the record I think something might be coming. My CAMP used to be right on the edge of the crater and it got forced into my pack with the new update due to it being in a no-build zone so it must be one of those areas they added to work towards future content.
---
I mean I‚Äôm not against team PvP I just don‚Äôt like zero cap exploiters. It ruins the fun of it all and Bethesda really didn‚Äôt think this through enough imo. Here‚Äôs to hoping they fix it soon tho
---
Yeah üòÉ and bird bones mutation 
---
Have you ever looked at any trading forum? They didn‚Äôt reduce all of the weapons and armor the dupers had. Believe what you want, but I don‚Äôt see how you can argue it when the truth is all around you in plain sight, and the numbers don‚Äôt lie.
---
The stabilized perk is very good mixed with aa guns, stabilized, while in power armor and rank 3 perk, gives 45% armor penetration and better accuracy with big guns, and anti armor gives 50%, so total 95%. That's what I use lol
---
I'm with you
---
If it wasn't for the data mining we wouldn't even know the rare ones existed. I think this is a lesson from Bethesda to not rely on data mining to "ruin" your experience.
---
Imagine this event where we all only knew of the 5 masks most of us already have... how different our feedback would be.
---
Instigating, furious and executioner are good for non vats. Even good in vats. But they work well without. 
---
Lever plan is sold at the vendor at the carnival in the ash heap and a few others there. Without hard bargain you buy it for 1k+, with level 3 I think it‚Äôs around 750. But to buy a legendary lever check out 76market subreddit, you will need much more than 750c for one though. Cheap 1* levers usually start at 1k.. depending on the type, 3* are 3.5k up to 20k, I have 4 and my cheapest was 4k 
---
Yes, they fixed it.
---
TSE is kind of a joke now&gt;! (one with a strong punchline) !&lt;. now everyone will be using Bloodied melee builds or Bloodied explosive builds.
---
I killed a guy back in BETA for gumdrops. 
---
You know, that does make sense. The 3*** Legendary Mutants literally run away from you. I‚Äôve actually lost a couple because they literally got away. Perhaps it it a built in bit of AI self preservation. Or it‚Äôs just the game trying to screw be out of a decent Legendary item. Either way. Bravo!
---
Didn't know anyone listened to classical radio on here lol
---
I found them..but is there a way that i can access it from a friend and teammates camp?
---
Pretty sure it's that huge ass extractor in the middle of the ash heap turning on. You can feel it through most of the map. 
---
Explosive shotguns are boss. instigating is pretty much the best prefix for PvE. Stacks with sneak bonus for ridic damage on undamaged dudes. (the worst one for PvP as no one ever has full health)  
---
Dont bother with the Explosives Expert perk (gives like 30-40 extra damage on my highest dmg TSE shotgun)  
---
I run an instigating sniper and Quad Handmade as my main weapons. TSE combat shotty for aggro/dense mob clearing. 
---
Mass produce and hope you get lucky
---
Tbh I've tried most things, letting 1,2,3,4 die. Completing the robots in a particular order.. all don't work, I even once tried to hack the robots with robotics perk
---
If not for the data mining, they would effectively not have existed and so many would not be whining about them.
---
Vendors. 
---
Nope, I kill my friends cow all the time just to piss him off (5 times in a row  yesterday when he‚Äôd walk away). I‚Äôve never in 300 hours of playing been wanted 
---
You‚Äôre welcome! Enjoy!
---
This is exactly me except that I am and have been overweight for a month or so... I need this legendary vendor NOW!!!
---
What the fuck are some of these comments......
---
They literally don‚Äôt drop, they DO NOT drop!
---
What fucking part of that do you fail to comprehend?
---
No, your argument of ‚Äúexceedingly rare duh‚Äù doesn‚Äôt stand for shit, they ARE NOT DROPPING.
---
Dear god y‚Äôall I love the game too but I swear some of you are fuckin‚Äô DENSE.
---
Also good for crafting and trading.
---
Well yeah care to be more specific
---
Haha I want to know now too!  Too bad people don't think to put their platform.  I was going to say, I hear this sort of thing from *PC*  the most! 
---
7/3 üòä
---
I got both, Forrest Outfit and Hat
---
Everyone finds their own way in game. 
---
The more you play the better the experience. 
---
The few people I know that have the game but haven‚Äôt played in a few month we‚Äôre having frame issues just reinstalled the game and it fixed its shite 
---
Just think of a build you like to do or try and grab a weapon and some nukashine and have at it. 
---
Thank you. I glad you like it. Thats a good idea üòÉ
---
Nah you cant build stuff that costs atoms at other peoples camps i believe
---
I‚Äôll take the healing one if you‚Äôre still selling
---
Whitespring Golf club back door turret farms are the only reason I don't like Bethesda's plan to stop camp damage.  How about letting us damage only turrets.
---
That statement is literally how I met everyone in my discord server haha
---
Most if not all of the will sell them pretty often.  The Sutton and most of the savage divide bots are classed as raider vendors. I‚Äôd start there. 
---
Events are a good way to amass plans too 
---
is this on consoles?
---
So wait, you attacking a guy that is destroying your property gives you a bounty?
---
Kinda broken isn't it?
---
Someone now just needs to figure out where MODUS left all the black paint so we don't need to wear this ridiculous bumble-bee power armor anymore!
---
As if the economy isn‚Äôt already overinflated or over saturated. 
---
I believe that in the road map of updates, there was a part called "Shear Terror", which included Sheepsquatch. 
---
I found the schematics in a safe in the antique store
---
Yes, PS4.
---
Best to keep .45, .308, 5.56 and 10mm as those are the more commonly used. Everything else is speciality. 
---
I generally find a container at the train station and pass my spares off to another player anonymously. 
---
I stole a bag that had 25 stimpaks and 30 radaways from someone who wanted to help the newer players by setting it in front of vault 76. 
---
O1G's shop and shelter above watoga city on the road not far where the tunnel starts 
---
Yeah I've had to chase quite a few. Especially at harpers ferry. It makes sense as a game and lore mechanic tbh that only they do that. üòÅ
---
RemindMe! 3 months 
---
Dealing with all the ceiling turrets solo can be tough.
---
So its basically a title of an upcoming event/content?
---
I think there's an official guidebook for enemies in the game that has Zetans in it. Not the Flatwoods Monster, just Zetans.
---

I actually wanted to talk to you

White springs. There's 5 (that I know of) in pretty close proximity to each other, and I go there every day to sell off my garbage anyway. It's the only caps routine I can be bothered with. This is my order.-
---
1. Inside the resort. Through the main doors, down the stairs, to the right, inside the luggage claim area, locked in that closet behind the desk. 
---
2. Inside the enclave bunker, right by the service exit. Next to an assaultron, on a shelf. 
---
3. On top of the service entrance to the enclave bunker. 
---
4. From the other enclave entrance, follow the road from the door, to the little security building. Its in the turned over trash can. 
---
5. Follow that connecting road, west, past all the cars and busses? Right through the golf course?  There's another security building, with a stash on a shelf. Building is south from the golf club, off that road that goes east / west. 
---
Yep I can help out on that one 
---
Cryptids are creatures whose existence have never been proven, like bigfoot or the loch ness monster. The sheepsquatch is a cryptid that I think originates from West Virginia and has been teased for one of the future updates.

---
In fact there are tons of places that are just perfect for quests. Let's hope the new game mode the will add in summer is about this and npcs and solo offline.
---
I've seen a few, but personally I've worn the Confederate uniform since level 11 when I found it at the Phillippi Battlefield Cemetery. I've even seen someone wearing a clean spacesuit.
---
Thanks! You cleared that up for me
---
People's hatred are now focused on Epic. Meanwhile Bethesda is in the corner quietly making the game better.
---
Seconded. Spill de beans.
---
Thanks mate. Just invite me to a team when you join the server 
---
If you want Raider armor part plans (like Light/Sturdy/Heavy Arms/Chest/Legs) the only place those drop are treasure maps and the Signal Strength Quest as a quest reward.
---
I respect the hustle 
---
There‚Äôs a counter to everything 
---
Is...is it Einstein?
---
We are talking about the marine armoured helmet not the common tactical marine helmet. So many get that mixed up. 
---
Nope! Just a single bullet for 400
---
Key cards are quite hard to find so do you have anything you could offer for me in return :)
---
was averaging one every 34 seconds on my WS runs. Then patch 7 introduced spawn timeouts...
---
There's profanity... And then there are slurs.   You might be a grown-ass adult, but I can't think of anything that wants to be called a racial epithet, or any other genuinely hateful thing... And I don't think anyone should have to hear that sort of stuff in playing games.  
---
Not a problem. Just let me know. 
---
Heck yeah, thanks to Uranium Fever, I've memorized those two at Blackwater Mine as well!
---
Yes, Stabilized for Heavy Weapons. Although, I don't think 50% from AA and 45% from the perk add up to 95%. I'm not certain how armour penetration actually works in this game, but if it's say 10% base you add 50% to that making it 15% and then additional 50% (round up from 45%) makes it 22.5% which is more than 20%. I could be wrong, however, and both only apply to base value which will make it 20%.
---
I discovered this one yesterday I think, and it also gave me a sizeable amount.
---
Nah I took a few chair plans from him.
---
Oh lol alright then
---
Huh, so would then the 45% be added to the 50% or vice versa? 
---
I do that all the time.
---
Unfortunately it's just the tactical one
---
Sorry my bad
---
Except the old man winter mask, recoloured to red....
---
Not sure about other places, but I believe the responder vendor sells it?
---
The travelling one does I think. The Responder protectron followed by Eyebots.
---
I gave up after eight runs of it after getting the common masks but the sloth stopped dropping legendaries.
---
Well You will get the loot and have a grind zone. And there not rare I‚Äôm just dumb 
---
Ah I should have specified, that‚Äôs the one I mean üòÖ
---
Plz put me in on the loop lol
---
We also need longer timers for auto pickup 
---
I agree. Me and my friend were just saying that yesterday, that it's a bit repetitive and we want more tracks. 
---
That's classified.
---
Dam sorry to hear that
---
Still technically a different item...
---
And non of the other makes have reskins according to datamining.
---
Are you talking about excavator armor or the Prototype XO-1 armor? Because you can already paint the XO-1 black by just taking off the Prototype paint job.
---
STR: Blocker and Bandolier are optional cards, but can help you. In addition you will have some extra carrying capacity from having 5 Strength points too.
---
PER: Perception is the one you want to focus on. Grab every automatic rifle-related perk cards that buffs damage (Commando, Expert Commando, Master Commando, Long Shot and Tank Killer). 
---
END: Known is QoL (Quality of Life) stat. Adamantium Skeleton is great for not getting crippled in fights too. 
---
CHA: If you like to solo, you want to invest in Lone Wanderer perk. Field Surgeon and Travel Agent are nice cards to have, as well as Tenderizer for combat.
---
INT: Gunsmith perk card is a must-have for any weapon. 5 points here is a no-brainer.
---
AGI: You could also invest another 5 points into Agility for Adrenaline if you're fighting a swarm of mobs regularly.
---
LCK: Buff for more damage with Bloody Mess from Luck tree for 3 points. If you want mutations you will want two perk cards that come from Luck - Starched Genes and Class Freak.
---
McCarren was New Vegas, so same universe, wrong installation lol
---
The masks seem to have a drop rate of -1 when looked in the Xedit *I'm probably reading the code wrong* but still the fact that the rare masks have different code from the really common masks is kinda weird
---
I swear X-01 turns into this absurdly shiny chrome-like material if you pull off the paint but I'll check that out later!
---
I think 45% would be added to the total value which is 150%. It would be a good question to ask one of the devs who has the numbers.
---
Oh lol looks like I‚Äôm the dumb one then cos I can never find.them
---
Also fissure sight or white springs 
---
It's underarmor and has a slot for a mod, but I have yet to find a lining for it :/
---
The standard x-01 paint had always been silver, is it black now?
---
There is something like that. If you're in pvp and you run out of caps (losing a fight for a workshop was probably what this was intended for as an example of fair use) you deal 50% less damage, which i think is huge. But maybe just have an auto passive mode for poor people?
---
It isn‚Äôt matte black, but it‚Äôs definitely not chrome. It‚Äôs the same color/texture XO-1 had in Fallout 4.
---
Yeah, you're right; players being completely invisible and not being able to target them, HILARIOUS!
---
Most of my best fallout friends started off as people that tried to PvP me and lost. Repeatedly. I always friend them if they try over and over. I like people with moxy.
---
I don't believe Luck has anything to do with the drop chances.
---
Hey, yeah I tried a bunch of different settings. Like being in group with chat on auto/team/area and the same while not being in a group. But it didn't make any difference. 
---
Whitesprings. And you can get them easily with the enclave 
---
Downvoting only to upvote you twice
---
That would be nice, to get a better understanding and if furious explosive or anti armor explosive is better
---
For some reason every Brahmin I approach (owned or otherwise) instantly treats me as hostile.
---
Well man, if you think your opinion is critical because is not positive then you have a problem. The gaming community is increasingly becoming more and more toxic, game journalist only roast games to make drama and get the views because a 7/10 review doesn't give you as much subscribers. And people like you who buys every idea that a stupid journalist desperate for subs and attention makes will never have a critical opinion. But yeah man, your idea is above all ideas because you have the absolute shit that is not even yours.
---
From what I understand they are supposed to be implementing penalties for having a "negative" caps limit, such as you can't buy from vendors. I can't remember where I saw it though so don't quote me.
---
Hm yeah that sounds like what I'm thinking. But I don't really know how/where to check if any specific audio thing isn't working. Since I don't think I could just right click on my volume mixer and see "fallout 76 talking slider" and crank that thing up. 
---
equal playing field since game launch? doubt it.
---
Oh shit, THAT‚ÄôS why. Explains a few things actually.
---
I think the person placing the bounty has to pay it don't they?
---
(XB1)
---
Im on PC and looking for an Automatic reciever for a handmade rifle. my account is of the same name
---
Shotgun+crits+headshot+perforatimg mag= most people die really quickly.
---
I had two ppl that were around level 150 attacking me during the parade and I was taking damage. They kept on after the parade so I logged out cuz I was full of junk and over encumbered. 
---
How did you get your main on the same server that it happened on?
---
You can't be damaged during events unless you are Wanted.
---
On the beginning I'm mainly using mele weapons with v.a.t.s unless the situation gets harder. So I have plenty of ammo at the moment. Mele weapons are fun to use, they force you to be in the right position, have cover and be very fast when attacking.
---
kind of makes me wonder if these posts just happens for praise at reddit. Kinda like youtube giving money to homeless looking for views.
---
They don't keep track of anything so probs not. It's not like WoW where there's a log of everything. They just save your character's "state" periodically
---
There should be an audio option under settings, if there is then therexs a slider called "chat"
---
Yeh I first had it happen in the cranberry bog near fissure site prime, then again just east of it. It was weird, there was nothing around either. 
---
Game journalist are the worst of the gaming community. They always find something to roast because it gives them more attention, they don't care if the game is good or not they just care on shit talking. If you want to know if a game is fun or not: watch small youtubers play it or play it yourself, there is no other way, sadly.
---
Pffff!
---
Well hold on a second. By that token you do realise that when people speak their words are interpreted in context? When people say "is that a phrase" its clearly a question regarding whether its a well known phrase that people use. Not just whether the words technically are in order.

If you're having trouble finding them there is a computer in the military wing of the Enclave bunker that lets you track the Cargobots that carry Nuclear Keycards.

Where is this place on the map??? I don't think I've stumbled upon it yet...

Just my .02 USD, but the tower should be inaccessible, for obvious reasons. If anything it should hide an escape rocket for Bush Senior's head in a jar.

I got my lvl 50 trophy bugged, and i read the same about the monster mashing event, I have a question: If I go to Watoga or near the School, can I get the trophy? Or do you recommend me not go near there?
---
If you mean the ingame settings, I've tried all those. If you mean on PC somewhere I'm not sure where to find those.

Fat man launches one more powerful bomb, MIRV launches 6 less powerful bombs

Still the development and the marketing are carried with different people. I don't think this game is worth 15‚Ç¨ that is the price you can buy it today. I do think the special edition (and not only in this game) is for special persons, and that was abused by greedy Bethesda in a failed attempt to make money.
---
Oh cool :o thanke
---
Also a stash box has appeared in production 
---
Yeah I meant game, sorry think I may not be much help at this point, I don't have a gaming PC so I barely game on it.  If I do hear anything about a fix though I'll let you know.
---
I have this same problem but with bourbon. Logging out and back in hasn't worked. Getting rid of all perk cards, changing clothes, changing weapons hasn't worked. I actually wouldn't mind if I could just go get a new daily mission from Biv, but he won't give me a new one till this one is done. Seriously, is there no way to abandon a daily challenge? 
---
No worries, thanks for the advice regardless.
---
Next....
---
Forgive me but whats a "turret farm" ?
---
Even if they fix the chances, I feel like it's already too late, the event is going to end soon, and a lot of people won't be able to get them.
---
On console, children?
---
I give up because even if they fix it, I won't be able to get them on time, so...
---
I killed a guy during the beta for picking up some pencils before I did because, well, lead. A guy needs pencils to make 5mm rounds!
---
It has happened to me enough times that I now carry a fatman and plenty of nukes just to kill griefers. I have killed quite a few now and they seem to be getting the point that most players are sick if them. If someone comes to my camp, I just server hop. I dont allow anyone to use my benches ect anymore even if they start out to be cool. I have had players open my door, see me and basically ask permission through emotes or gestures and they are usually net with a high power firearm in the face and me saying please leave. I wish it was not that way but if had my entire base destroyed and not enough junk to rebuild it and had to basically start over. I have tried to be civil with these bastards in the past. Taking slap damage and just walking away ect but these people are complete losers. The messed up part is they would act this way in real life it no one would punish them. 
---
Well that's good to know for certain. I don't know why they were bullying me afterwards. I didn't even get a chance to get a hit on the sloth that showed up toward the end. Some ppl on ps4 are just jerks I guess. 
---
I can almost guarantee that there will be an alien DLC, probably with new quests, stuff for your base, alien masks and maybe even new weapons. At least the alien blaster should get updated, we will probably get a lot more info about the flatwood monsters, and hopefully a crashed spaceship raid area.   
---
There is so much to build on from this, and this is an opportunity they can't miss. And so much lore they can connect, how the ATLAS experiments actually attracted aliens and so on. 
---
Is that not the entire point of posting on the Internet? I did something and I want people to know about it. Praise me, criticise me, whatever. This sub is about sharing stories about the game, and that's what I did.
---
Why does it matter so much? 
---
I can sell you the plan.
---
Some people are just jerks everywhere. 
---
I played 5-10 times, finally got the 5th mask to complete the set yesterday.
---
From what I've read, I'm glad I didn't waste any more time on this event (as good as it was). I would suggest no one else wastes their time today playing it either..
---
It matters to some people, not all people. Some people enjoy rare items and if said items are obtained legitimately then that is good. I enjoy hunting down rare items/weapons. 
---
There was a reply from Bethesda on WaffleCops datamine saying "its working as intended" but thats not saying that they are dropping. So for all we know its gonna be last day till they drop or that Juice guy is was the chosen one from Todd himself.
---
A whole bunch of turrets set up on a camp in a location that serves only to kill things for its owner at the cost of annoying everyone else in the game.
---
Itll probably be like the gate at the Mojave outpost. Locked with no intention of opening, unless more money is spent. Lol. 
---
Ah ok thx 
---
From what I have found out they move around the C.A.M.P. item so wherever it is placed they will move around that area so keep moving it and it should help u
---
That is exactly what I did with this guy. He sought revenge on me like  4 times, and I hit him in the head with my super sledge just to dissuade him. He even followed me to my CAMP and shot at me with a Blunderbuss and did like a whopping 10 damage or something before I flattened his face. Finally, when I had taken like 50-60 caps off him I sent him a team invite and travelled to him while he was at his CAMP, except there was no actual CAMP, just the CAMP module on the ground near Flatwoods.
---
iv Been playing since launch and this has happened a grand total of zero times to me at all
---
Just did it a minute ago with 3 people. No robots lost but same result I always get. I never get the receipes or beret but always the confetti plans or flag pole plans again and again.
---
If the rare masks start showing up on the last few days then I will jump in but otherwise I've had it.
---
I'm not really that much of a veteran but I like to help new players. When I was level 20ish, I met a couple who were close to 100. They built me a full set of Excavator that I still use, two full sets of leather and combat armor and a fusion generator  at my CAMP. I can't do so much yet for people, but I try to treat people the way I have been treated in this game.
---
It caps at +50%. These other numbers are nuts. 
---
I hated cannibalism in the other Fallout games but I've full on embraced it in 76. It's an excellent way to heal yourself combines with lead belly 3, when you are low on stimpaks.

Ah, the unspoken bond of cannibalism. Once you've had another player inside you, giving them some ammo is really the least you can do.
---
At least buy them a drink first, we're not savages. *hides chainsaw behind back*
---
Not gonna go for all the plans?
---
mole miners drop a lot of them, do a few uranium fever events and you should get a decent amount. but the best option is to get the ammosmith perk in agility and craft your ammo yourself, saves a lot of time and you get a lot more that way
---
&gt; Once you have had another player inside you
---
That can happen in one of several ways, and cannibalism is not how most people would prefer it.

Speck ammo and super duper. Make like a 1000 at the tinker work bench. Just need gunpowder, steel, and lead. Maybe plasic. Easy to farm mats
---
Yeah so I‚Äôm not really talking about bounties when it comes to survival mode, really the zero cap PvPing is the problem. The Bounty issue more comes into play in adventure mode. I think we all agree that -50% damage for the player isn‚Äôt good enough when their teammates can still do full damage to you, it‚Äôs an unintended exploit and needs to be fixed soon imo.
---
Turn most of them off at the terminals. 
---
Little bit.... I jserver hopped into a fasnatch parade and said over the mic, "anybody want 50 caps?" Boom. Bounty cleared.
---
I'm learning not to worry about bounties. It's only my second one of the game. Honestly, this

---
Watoga/Morgantown High School for plastic, Charleston Fire Dept + the Flatwoods gym for lead, steel you can get everywhere and gunpowder you can craft with acid and cloth. Combine that with super duper perk &amp; ammosmith, you will craft hundreds of rounds a time.
---
Well, lucky you.
---
Yeah I haven‚Äôt read anything about that but honestly it doesn‚Äôt solve anything if that‚Äôs their fix. It needs to be a real time mechanic where they are severely punished for exploiting the system, as well as anyone who happens to be on a team with them at the time.
---
How pathetic is the drop rate when you say the juice guy and I know your talking about 100 juice no pulp? Like the guy has become a celebrity as the only fucking person on planet earth to hit a mask.
---
I got 3 or 4 unique ones, not sure how many there are. But when I looked at them in my camp they're not really for me anyway :)
---
I made it bigger later. Also can't hand down everything to people. They gotta earn their own place in the world or else communism wins.
---
He's got his own personal griefer now. I know his name. I'll find him again.
---
What‚Äôs the point of these bases around white springs anyway? 
---
I have more giant and owl heads than I can shake a stick at 
---
What exactly are they supposed to do? Everything in your post is part of the game mechanics, and we wonder why we can‚Äôt get patches that address legitimate issues and bugs? Because people like you complain about things that you could easily avoid by doing 5 minutes of research into PvP restrictions. Smh 
---
I agree. I have 300 hours into the game. And I'm level 86. And I've have someone try to destroy my Camp twice.
---
One was legit people trying to be stupid. And the other was a guy really just dick and around and he was very low-level that I don't think he knew what he was doing
---
Someone nuked Morgantown the other day.
---
I've lived6, peacefully, just outside Morgantown since the beta.
---
First time I ever had to rebuild my place.
---
Finding/crafting 60+ fertilizer was terrible!
---
I‚Äôve been just dropping all my doubles for people who don‚Äôt have them. My roommates still only got the owl mask and refused my doubles lol
---
You OK bro?
---
I usually store all the items in my camp then move the camp, that way it is very cheap to move. Usually about 6 - 12 caps if you won't a screenshot/proof then ask and ill post.
---
There's 13 CAMP plans and 2 food recipes.  
---
That‚Äôs obviously an exaggeration by the OP, never encountered this before and I PvP everyday. Don‚Äôt you think if this was an exploit people would be using it to dominate everyone? The raiders used stealthboys and the OP doesn‚Äôt understand, it‚Äôs fine just sad honestly.

I got the beret only once but many of them common masks.

Dixie the deathclaw was a peach. Sure, she was red, but she never made any aggressive move toward a visitor.

If you want a general idea of what you're going to be up against (especially solo), I used [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRdb0lLxAMs) when I launched my first nuke. Some good guns and lots of ammo are a must I'm afraid, especially since you're going to be a little lost the first time and the defences keep renewing.
---
Great tip. I'll add that to the bloatfly syringing every enemy category!
---
It's kinda obvious to read between the lines, especially when you stutter in text lol.
---
If I did, I wouldn‚Äôt get to do anything else as my camp is just a shed with some workbenches. 
---
I can‚Äôt be bothered putting time into building until game is more stable. 
---
Well, next update they'll completely renove slap damage. You take no damage unless you respond with a hit. They also plan to make camps indestructible unless pvp has been initiated as well.
---
Everything _was_ stored. It had just been placed, I built nothing and then moved it from the train bridge near Top of the World to the road right down the hill.
---
Sure, I'll be on later today. GT: Exponenttulip38 
---
The drops are either so rare that only a handful of people have obtained them across all platforms or the drops are broken. I'd assume the drops are broken. I doubt Bethesda would make a cosmetic mask from a likely yearly event the most rare item in the game. It just doesn't make sense.  
---
Sounds good, I'll come back then.
---
Also, what's this mask thing going on? Everyone on the server was clustered around Helvetia.
---
Sure, usually play a little everyday, more on the weekends. GT: Exponenttulip38 
---
Thanks just completed the entire quest line - I hit lvl 31 during this little excursion... so I gather that upgrading legendaries requires plans ... or a recipe. How is this obtained? As that was my original concern - I didn‚Äôt know you could lvl those (quest rewards) up with you.
---
The rules change on pvp next week.  And they are going to extend pacifist mode to camps in a subsequent update. 
---
Where exactly is it?
---
Are you on PC? Ill give you 1000 for free
---
I haven‚Äôt heard ‚Äúmany‚Äù people say it should go f2p but if you wanna provide sources I‚Äôll inquire further, it‚Äôs still a terrible idea tho in this age of pay to win. Tell me how their updates are leading us towards a f2p game? I‚Äôm genuinely interested and waiting..
---
There's a new event happening his week called the Fasnacht Parade. This is part of the first set of DLC called Wild Appalachia that started on March 19 and will continue up to mid May which will add a lot of new content into the game. Two more DLC called Nuclear Winter and Wastelanders are to follow later this year.
---
All the existing canned foods in the game do not expire. It makes sense that foods you preserved yourself wouldn't either. 
---
As a trade off, they could make it so freshly cooked food has more benefits, and the canned stuff isn't as nutritional but doesn't expire.
---
Powerful auto receiver will help or tweaked if you rely on vat crits. Under agility covert ops and sandman will get your sneak critical up to 3.75 if you use stealth. Gun fu is actually nice for 30%extra damage and better with Adrenaline. If your handmade is explosive then demolition is your thing. Don't get blocker because you can't block with a gun.
---
Most importantly keep condition fixed over 100% for extra damage.
---
As someone else pointed out about what cryptids are, fallout 76 itself is teeming with cryptids. Mothman,Flatwoods Monster,Grafton Monster,Wendigo,Snallygaster. all considered cryptids.
---
I'll be farming it. Saving all the plans I get. We got you covered.
---
I try to trade/give them away at the end of the events. I wish more people would use mics (Xbox) 
---
I was doing project, where i arrived at claimed workshop when owner was near, then i asked then to give me food, or i will kill them.
---
I killed two level 6 guys, that probably can't hear me, cause of team voicechat option.
---
Also some frech/italiano told me he don't understand english, so i called him spaghetti and kill him too.
---
I was heavily under effects of psycho. Don't use drugs kids!
---
Aliens and different ranks including Star Admirals are already in the game files.
---
Obviously? M'kay.
---
While I get where you're coming from on the Steins and Wax, I'd like to say this is the first time since the Extractor nerf that we can reliably farm acid at a rate that matches the average consumption of a player's needs.
---
I don't want them to keep the server hopping wax deal. But I'd love for them to keep it as a 24 hour instance; being able to get the 50-60 acid once a day is great. A lot better than the 10/hour extractors.
---
This is wrong. They only sell power armor. No vendor sells regular armor plans. 
---
U get witch mask on end, we are magicans!
---
People are exploiting the game mechanics to grief workshop owners. No way Bethesda intended for teams to start to contest a workshop to initiate PVP, kill the owner (anywhere on the map), and not actually claim the workshop so they could start contesting it again, reinitiate PVP, and kill the owner again (and again and again). Taking advantage of bad code to do things that weren't intended is what the dupers did and it's what these guys do with the workshop mechanics. So, yeah, they are related. They're both wrong and cheating. Anyone who gets attacked like that at a workshop should report the team for using an exploit/cheating.
---
I fixed 2 camps near that event today. One was a low level player and another was 100+ being the red house trader. Griefers got both of them and wiped their camps then they tried for me lol. Big mistake. 
---
I'd like the beret, but man, I \*need\* the sausage.
---
God i made a post with 4 upvote about this serious and disturbing issue!
---
You got baited by raiders! It's a harsh wasteland out there. Good luck!
---
I wish I could get the dough nut receipe. All I get is confetti plans and flagpole plans over and over.
---
Inb4 it's because his base is just outside of whitesprings golf club
---
Sucks you lost it, my friend lost his after the patch also. With the event going on it would of gotten blown up by players sadly.
---
This. Also, there are a bunch of mole miners just outside of Welch Station and pretty much everywhere in Ash Heap.
---
Also once you start burning through your plastic you can farm the super mutants with laser rifles. Each scraps to ten plastic with scrapper on. 
---
Since you feel so comfortable throwing words around maybe just call em Nazis? You delegitimize actual griefing concerns with these posts and are obviously just looking for a little pity party to be thrown in your honor. This isn‚Äôt hello kitty adventures it‚Äôs fallout, be a grownup and learn the rules of the game. Sheeezus 
---
I made a post about this terrible and serious issue, but nobody cared!
---
Maybe a possible Zetan quest?

---
I can't wait to dump all these mask on Wednesday.
---
I'm the same, It's not the item itself... It's the rarity that lures me into the grind. Trouble is though is that I've done this event nearly 100 times and not even seen the mask yet. The first couple of days of grinding the event I was always running into the same people server hopping, so there were many others grinding alongside me. I don't see those people anymore, I guess they decided to give up.   
---
I remember on Runescape an item would come out that's 1/5,000 drop rate and there would be outstanding evidence of drops and information regarding the item only a couple days following the update, and that's purely from the playerbase itself. It seems like these masks might be the most rare item currently in the game if it isn't bugged, which I do think It's bugged because it makes no sense for Bethesda to make a cosmetic mask the most rare item in-game. 
---
Agree because I'm a bloody unyielding build and you can't get better stats then that. And I still have only gotten the basic pinata head mask. I have good RNG also but the event is no joke.
---
I just want your caps and loot gezz. 
---
Nope. Out in the Cranberry Bog. 
---
Thank you!  Yes I saw.  I‚Äôm so determined to get a full group of people doing this silly and ridiculous thing that brings such joy for no reason.  
---
I've only been hoarding 3*s for the vendor 
---
Yep...done 18 runs through watago over the last couple of days trying to achieve that robot kill quest and I haven‚Äôt seen one legendary:(
---
To be fair, between levels 15-45 I had my camp outside the Whitespring and it happened all the time, but even with my out of the way location it seems to happen more than it should. 
---
They could add aliens to the game using the space station, mabey it crashed because aliens invaded it :o
---
It's in the toxic valley to the north west.  I thought it had a landmark on the map.
---
RIP MooMoo and friends :(
---
For Bethesda standards it‚Äôs a bad game.
---
The people that criticised the game are mostly long gone and have moved on to better things. I don‚Äôt even bother reading through the subreddit like I used to. With so many games that have and will come out no one will remember the disgrace that was fallout 76. 
---
This has nothing to do with duping, trying to draw false equivalences is the sign of a poor argument. I‚Äôd love for you to tell me how you know this isn‚Äôt what Bethesda intended? seems like you‚Äôve got the inside scoop buddy care to let me in? I don‚Äôt engage in this kind of PvP but it‚Äôs ridiculous to claim it‚Äôs griefing when it literally tells you you‚Äôre setting yourself up to be engaged in PvP when you take a workshop! No where in that message does it specify only in the workshop zone. 
---
The only reason the owner can get killed multiple times is because they choose to not leave the world, there are game mechanics in place to create a safe space for those that wish to opt out, sadly some people would choose to not use these and instead come complain on Reddit where no one can help them. I see the same post every 10 hours and it‚Äôs always the same thing, ‚Äúgriefers killed me obviously cheating because they were using stealth boys and I don‚Äôt know how I even got engaged in PvP‚Äù. 
---
Either way still kinda seems bs. If someone's trashing your base you could have just moved or waited for next week's patch rather than posting an attention seeking rant on reddit
---
They drag all the Ghouls out of the building at WS, mow them down. Person normally hangs around pings each ghoul with a pistol and the turrets do the work. 
---
The amount of wasted XP/ Loot mean these things are a menace. 
---
Good riddance.
---
Obvious to anyone who‚Äôs got half a brain, but my apologies I shouldn‚Äôt have assumed your intelligence. 
---
So you brought it on yourself, basically.
---
Don't read between the lines, I don't write between the lines. That's not a stutter, that's me rephrasing what I'm thinking.
---
Good tip I was feeling a bit bad about randomly dropping stuff so I'll do that. BTW do you know how long things you drop or place in the game world remain for? Until you disconnect or for a set time? 
---
What platform you on bud
---
I feel like the mirv is not a good upgrade from what I hear. 
---
Isn't Lever-Action locked to level 25?
---
This. They usually wait and tag with a tesla, then let their turrets ruin everyone else's farm
---
Agreed, or if it‚Äôs an assasins weapon let it boost sneak attack damage aswell. Then it could stay as the main prefix but get a much needed buff.
---
I think that they're releasing this new feature along with the legendary player. Because this will cause another weight issue. They said that when a player has reached lvl 50 they can reset their level to level 1 and become a legendary player with new and more powerful perks. But the question is what's going to happen with all our gear? We won't be able to use our max lvl weapon / armor and we have to stash them all PLUS all these legendaries we have been hoarding lol.
---
Imagine when you reset to lvl 1. You'll be sent back to Vault 76. You don't have traveling pharmacy. All those stimpacks will turn into 1 lbs each.
---
No Bandolier either. You gotta drop all those excessive amount of ammos.
---
Your STR will be 1 lol.
---
Unyielding armor to help boost your STR? forget it. They're lv 50. It's gonna be a while to lvl back to 50.
---
TL;DR Life was much harder dor murderbuilds before the TSE nerf, and its the casuals that were hurt the most by the TSE nerf they wanted.
---
I know this might be sounding like bragging but thats besides the point and this will be math discussion in which my person in irrelevant. TBH I believe the only good TSE modification when compared to their previous levels would be to deny Demo Expert perk stackability with Explosive legendary effect. In dmg discussion, I believe that would be the best solution, the previous values were the next good, and the current values are the worst, they significantly favor murder-builds and put regular people on disadvantage.
---
Let me explain why I believe so.
---
I wear some crazy armor pieces. I can live through some shots when standing, I can sprint for two minutes, I cannot be killed by "regular old damage" anymore when I am sprinting, and I even regenerate health midfight for free, faster than people damage me. Its hundreds of hours of research. Now, if you are not a perfect build, if you are not an expert in the game, and I am not AFK I'll probably wont be killed in PvP. During the previous TSE values, anybody could spent 5k caps on reddit market and get themselves a weapon that would shoot through my armor and reliably kill me even with imperfect build - the relationship between positioning on map and sported gear was more favoring positioning than it is now.
---
And if you need a little more plastic hit up everyone‚Äôs favorite crazy cat lady right up the road from Morgantown high school, just don‚Äôt get too triggered by the one bowl that won‚Äôt budge. 
---
They probably will, there are alot of hints around it leading to future content. Locked doors, paper and the sheer size of it would lead me to believe that they will.  
---
Dockers clothes?
---
No worries. I figured I'd bypass that potential headache and go with a fresh install.
---
The only thing that seems to make any difference is running the game directly from Fallout76.exe.
---
It's still not at the performance levels I remember, but it is a bit better if I don't use the bethesda launcher.
---
I have doubles of most of the plans and every mask (non rare) also have an extra hat. 
---
Shh! That's classified information!
---
And it wasn't even his Camp, but mine - it looks exactly the same.
---
This is where I wish we could drop items instead of lunch bags.
---
The places we could stack these masks &amp; the photos we could take.
---
I have a headset, my username is Viorlu. 
---
What's this?
---
If you contest a workshop you don‚Äôt go wanted for destroying structures, once PvP is engaged you can damage anything they‚Äôve built without consequence. The reason you couldn‚Äôt do damage was because you were in pacifist mode, if you‚Äôre gonna take a workshop and want to be able to defend yourself turn it off. 
---
I just find it ridiculous you‚Äôre crying to Bethesda when they‚Äôre releasing a fix just for you in a few days, full blown Pacifist mode where neither you nor your camp can be hurt unless you willingly engage in PvP. And yes that means claiming workshops.
---
I do however think scrapping would be great, ie. to reclaim plastic from shotgun shells, lead, nuclear waste (or whatever) from fusion cells or possibly recycle them to create fusion cores. Can understand the selling issue as it used to be a good way to make caps fast in other Fallout versions, sell ammo from weapons you don't use a lot.
---
Another related issue, are you able to sell Notes (plans/recipes) to any vendors in the game or just to other players? Another item I have a surplus of and don't know how to get rid of.
---
What is this you are speaking of? The Brotherhood would like more info
---
If we will see each other on the map it wont be survivor...it will be battle royal. And sadly Bethesda still didnt answer my questions about this. True Survivor mode shouldn't let us use teleportation or see other players. Finding another player on the map should be a luck, instead of disastrous ganking low level players....but i guess we will see. I have a bad feelings, i rly dont want battle royal
---

---
My main is lvl 190 and I've just started to get decent drops in the last couple weeks. Rng is shit 
---
Ahh ok thanks guess I got some work cut out for me
---
We are Spartacus
---
I think they should rework Assassin‚Äôs weapon prefix and Assassin‚Äôs armor. 
---
Armor should be renamed Bodyguards, same effect. Assassins should stay, but instead of a damage boost, have it ignore the Bodyguard effect. 
---
I think the best option is to extend the event and raise the chance of finding one of these "rare" masks
---
and the Oscar for best drama goes to...
---
Luck doesn‚Äôt affect any drop chances.
---
El cinco de Mayo...because come on, who wouldn‚Äôt want to a decorations.
---
Fuck anyone who plays the game
---
This is great! This is what I wanted the game to be, building communities 
---
Nah they‚Äôd rather not bother to understand the mechanics of the game and have a pity party on reddit instead. The word griefing gets thrown around so much these days I feel bad for people who actually get griefed, but Bethesda has too many false reports like these to look at instead. OP doesn‚Äôt understand they‚Äôre actually crying wolf and abusing the report features.
---
Sorry, that was supposed to be a joke. My Camp also has Camp module only...
---
So it's actually a human sacrifice?
---
Nah, it‚Äôs multiplicative. So if you have Stablized, against someone with 100 armor, they‚Äôre reduced to 55 armor (-45% of 100 is 55). Add in an AA weapon and it‚Äôs 50% of that 55, so 27.5 armor left. 
---
Tomorrow im probably gonna grind it out for most of the day before the event ends. But im happy with what i have now, i have most of the optainable masks that i like and all the camp items that i wanted so its already a win in my book
---
I would really like to have that outfit. Looks like a true raider.
---
They should drop from any quest in the savage divide. I know I got raider Arms plans from One Silent Night
---
How do you fix other people‚Äôs Camps? Is there a ‚Äòrepair‚Äô option like in Workshops?
---
Defend all you want... Those ultracite numbers weren't legit.

You need play according to the level and zone. The central zone (the forest) is appropriate for the first 10 levels. The North (toxic valley) will be your main zone between levels 10-20. Then I could recommend the South (Ash heap) at level 20 and the east (Savage divide) at level 25. The next are the Mire (east of Savage divide with 35+) and cranberry bog (southeast with 45+).
---
I could recommend you farm munitions in the forest (or lead, polvore and steel). The enemies are easy to kill with melee. Take workshops to level up fast and easy.
---
Got on at 4 am to try this. Didn‚Äôt worküòÇ
---
Today is the best day to get started on your CAMP, then, my friend! Safety in the Wastelands begindms at your CAMP!
---
Used to only be the queen. I‚Äôm not sure, but I think patch 6, when they added PA plans to vendors, they did the same for the Decon shower
---
The beret and effigy seem like what I would consider rare drops... I've done it many many times and only have received 1 beret and 2 effigy
---
They should just be unkillable. It's sooo easy to accidentally kill one, and it may not be clear at all it's even in a camp
---
400%, 50%, x2.5... Who the fuck is right lol ? 
---
That is correct. If you see a broken item anyone can walk up and repair it. Even if not on a team or a friend. I messaged the the houses owner after I saw the aftermath. The new event is just a huge pvp zones after it ends. 
---
I think Sturdy has a chance to drop in Savage Divide, but Light and Heavy do not.
---
If you are on PS4 I can sell one to you. Me and my friend are starting a mutation store. Marsupial is 1500 caps.
---
Wut?   Lol. 
---
Luck only effects condition and durability of loot. Says right in your handy pipboy 
---
Would you mind linking the devil mask sighting if you can? Haven't seen that one.
---
my issue with these pictures is that not a single person has been able to get a shot/video of the mask actually dropping after the event. The majority of "evidence" are pictures of random sightings, with only a couple of reports coming from the owners themselves. 
---
I have up to Paladin so far, just need Elder.  14 turned in yest, but I but I didn't score it yet.  Did get more outfits, a Bomber Jacket and another Shielded Underarmor plan.
---
I wear the suit, and switch up the hats. I‚Äôve also never seen anyone else wear it. 
---
Ok that‚Äôs what thought.:
---
Good to know - thanks!
---
All you have to do is engaging buy from a vendor, WS train station works great, and stay there. You'll last less than a minute.
---
How come you are so sympathetic on another thread about zero cap PVP but now hollering at someone who has genuinely been serially griefed and wants to vent? Are you a synth now bc you seemed like a regular lovely wastelander on that other thread.
---
Yup yup no problem 
---
Doubtful. Highly. 
---
I haven't seen one yet. 
---
I like the idea of compost heaps or compost bins, maybe a subpod as well (those underground worm bins). In addition to that, I would like more things to grow (and as ingredients for more cooking recipes as well). I was just recently looking up how to grow cocoa trees.   
---
So my ideas are mutapples, mutcherries, mutoranges and coffee.
---
Though I am not sure how growing coffee, cocoa and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg would work because those are tropical plants and this is West Virginia, they would have to be grown in a geodesic dome greenhouse - which btw I think would make a good addition in to the game. The way I imagine it working is that it would require wood for the door and doorframe, steel for the struts, glass for the triangular windows and concrete for the foundation  to build and it would automatically level the ground which it is placed on (also removing trees that are in the way). To make things more complex, it could require parts to build which you have to find or build using another new crafting station - a glass foundry which can melt glass as well as steel and aluminum and includes moulds that can make specific parts out of those materials (bottles out of any of those materials, geodome windows out of glass and whatever else I am not thinking of at the moment).

---
A 3v dome with a diameter of 42 ft and center height of 18ft would require 75 triangular windows and let's say it takes 2 glass to make 1 window that would be 150 glass or 10 bulk glass (each bulk glass containing 15 glass) to make the 75 windows. There would also be 120 struts made out of, let's say steel. And lets say 1 steel makes 1 strut that would be 4 bulk steel (each bulk steel containing 30 steel) to make the 120 struts.  
---
So there you go. A placeable dome that requires 10 bulk glass, 4 bulk steel, 2 bulk concrete, a few wood and a glass foundry to build and which you would need in order to grow coffee, cocoa, cinnamon and nutmeg. I think that when you build it (or other large things) it should take time to build - as in once you place it, then it will be translucent with a countdown timer counting down from 20 minutes. 20 real life minutes and then it will be there and usable. (moving it shouldn't take time though because that would frustrate players who change their mind on the placement location). It would be cool if you could fish farm tilapia called "mutfish" in domes or player-built structures.
---
Classical is really nice, and a good variation to the same songs that keep playing on the Appalachian radio.
---
I got my inside scoop reading the "Inside the Vault" and the patch notes. Bethesda was pretty clear on what their intent was. Guess what though? Surprise! There's a way to make it completely unfair, but sure, you keep arguing that was their intent. And they want people server hopping, too. You must work in gaming. 
---
You have been summoned for court marshalling for the offence of distribution of information marked classified by Enclave personnel.
---
Also, MODUS is pissed.
---
Sorry, you are correct, they are lvl 68 in the post-nuke zone.
---
My mind was thinking of the lvl 90+ glowing deathclaw.
---
I made an alt and put a camp by text overseers camp. I logged on 4 times to build and 3 of them had a rad storm
---
And what does the owner gets? XP? 
---
Didn‚Äôt work for me on XB1 
---
Hello,  
---
It is under dev and will come out in a next dlcs. It's been hinted and announced.
---
I'm not 'giving up' as my intention is to get all the camp plans. I have all the normal masks and I like the other ones being crazy rare. It makes them actually valuable.
---
And 'as a community'? People keep trying to speak for everybody with their opinions.
---
I'm guessing dual boxning, your own mule service for easy transfers.
---
Yeah I've done it a couple of dozen at least and only once some of the robots died.
---
With a 0.03 % chance of having one of them, I don't care in a bit now.  
---
I already didn't care much about those masks so...
---
Its actually a good design decision that will make being OP due to cheats harder. Example: with 100 stealth boys MK3 its pretty easy to be griefing people. There is however no unkillable build and sooner or later such guy would die. If they died with their stealthboys and dropped them, they will not be having hundred of them on them in a given time anymore, they'll start using smaller quantities - and this will make fighting them more applicable for regular players.
---
I‚Äôd love to see the old shanty walls and roofs (especially the ones with fabric) from Fo4 -I want to make some crazy raider-style settlements! 
---
ive done about 50 - 70 runs , not one bot died on anyrun. I have the Beret and all the common masks and plans.
---
No on in any run ive done has equipped any of the rare masks
---
Fake story

---
Well there is an Exterminator perk and its so bad it should be removed, I'll take assassin over exterminators ALWAYS.
---
Darn I have a blue one, and I was looking around for the Forrest one yesterday and found a blue one. I just left it because I know other people collect them too.
---
I have a green one, but wasn't sure if it was a mistake (like the spelling) that it should have been called forrest.
---
No I have seen 50
---
Search this subreddit, narrowed to the last week.   
---
You will find your answer.
---
It‚Äôs not pretty. 
---
üòúüòâ
---
Ya that guy. The only that Ive seen pics of with a mask and its only that mask(oldman winter). 
---
Good how do we do this my dude
---
Wouldn't you like to know.
---
Go back to the nut house.
---
If you look at the robots, you can see a sun and jester that no one has. Old man winter is the other one that I know is missing.
---
I think that anything above medium textures uses too much Vram for a 970. 
---
Otherwise I guess it's because you have only 8gb of ram 
---
Like i said, could have something to do with how the roof is made.
---
When people suggest modifications to PvP related items its usually 'I dont have it so nerf it'. You, on the other hand, have just proposed a mechanic that is interesting, that is a big change but neither a buff nor a nerf, just rework that would add another interesting layer to build competition and P2P trading. I fully support this idea.
---
Yes, I have the mask too.
---
Moxie
---
I wasn't sure if I was on r/fo76, so thanks for confirming it for me. I have 5 points in intelligence.
---
What platform do you play F76 on?
---
Of course there are many effects no one really uses but this is specifically compared to the armor effect -8% dmg to players which can be added with other dmg reduction or resistance so on the other hand we need a ranged weapon add like Two Shot + Killer ;)
---
It‚Äôs intentional. Levelling WAS too quick and they patched down a lot of exp. but it is certainly not slow now. Events and the typical high level high traffic areas are still your best bet. 
---
That's possible. Did you run some tests or do you have access to dev info?
---
Not at all. I literally posted a picture of the shack I built for him. I mean, what does it cost me to make that? I have built way bigger CAMPs for other low level players. It's also a great way to clear out my stash, so I like doing it. I don't use a lot of wood or steel anyway as my CAMP is done and weapon maintenance doesn't need as much when you use melee.
---
And yes, I did eat him with my cannibal perk. Thrice.
---
I'm placed in such way its clearly visible from Golf Club for last three months. Zero attacks on my property : o
---
Any areas in particular? I not very familiar with high level areas. 
---
if you are using something with higher magazine capacity, Furious should be the best, because even before TSE nerf, it was considerable alternative. When TS was 100% damage, then Furious was 80+%. Right now none of the weapons give that. Yes instigating gives 100%, but if you don't kill monster with 1 hit, your weapon becomes useless.  And TSE aint just 20% + 25%, it a 25%+20%+20% (explosion, 20% damage, gets triggered twice). That is still pretty solid damage and that aint situational.
---
I don't have the effigy yet.
---
Do you have a friend who you can help you clear enemies? I started a new character yesterday and just hit level 35. We just server hop whitesprings, i throw molitivos and tag enemies while he slaughters them.
---
Personally I think killing high level enemies is the fastest way if you have an effective way to do it and youre willing to grind a few locations. Otherwise, quests and workshops maybe.
---
Yeah it's frustrating as hell 
---
Could I have some of your Doritos &amp; Mtn Dew please?
---
With the bed buff, go to Whitespring golf club and server hop, or fuse 2 farms; maybe 3 star legendary with exp farm at wes tek. 2 objective 1 run üôèüèª
---
You might have to bump those numbers up a bit, in my younger days it was nothing to knock back 60 std drinks in one night without getting alcohol poisoning so 6-7 is a bit of a streach
---
Again this ain‚Äôt serial griefing. The OP said it was different people every time, no one followed them to different servers and repeatedly killed them. That‚Äôs griefing just so you know. 
---
Zero cap PvPing is something Bethesda dislikes aswell. In fact they put a system in place to prevent it but did not go far enough. If the OP were to say ‚Äúhey we need a change to the workshop PvP system so people can‚Äôt kill us across the map‚Äù I probably would‚Äôve commented with links to the other 30 posts just like this today and moved on. 
---
Instead they chose to engage in hyperboles and make disingenuous claims about griefing without fully understanding the mechanics of the game. It‚Äôs obvious they don‚Äôt bother to understand how PvP works and how to avoid it. My first post was actually very respectful and meant to educate the OP on how to avoid this, instead they chose to downvote and not engage so I decided to educate them a little further. 
---
TL;DR the difference is my argument about zero cap PvP is in good faith while the OP chose to go on a witch hunt about duper‚Äôs and griefers without bothering to understand the mechanics behind it. Ignorance doesn‚Äôt equal innocence. 
---
They never said it would be a reset to lvl 1, that was a player theory. Might be you need to reach lvl 100 or higher and it resets back to 50 to avoid that problem. Could not be a reset at all. All they said was it would be a upcoming feature with legendary players.
---
Ok smart ass, the "main questline" I couldn't finish. 
---
Hey, about the .50 cal "bug". I honestly think it's not a bug at all.
---
On 4 we had the weight/damage ratio but I believe on 76 it's value/damage. The reason behind it is the crafting, .50 is cheaper to craft but weights more, but not as much as it did on 4.
---
Expect to never play again. They don't care about you. 
---
Still rains scorchbeast spit through like 5-feet of concrete
---
Everything is saved on the cloud so you will lose no progress. In fact, you can play the game by logging into your account from any computer/console that has Fallout 76 installed and your progress will carry. Note that your pictures are saved locally, so if you wipe your hdd or manually delete the pics, they will be gone forever, but uninstalling should no affect them.
---
Let me rephrase my point: I don't think what you proposed is bad idea, I don't think it'd make game worse, I think its okay, but I also think that there are prefixes and perks that should be buffed by 300% and will still be weak. +40% bashing damage should be +200% bashing damage, for example. I think fixing these completely useless perks is more important than making the medicore assassin less medicore. Terrible ones deserve more attention than medicores.
---
Just like real alcohol poisoning. :/
---
At low level, events are your best choice along with doing the main quest. After a certain point, you could try going to Whitesprings and nuked areas.
---
Survival mode can't get here soon enough.
---
Im not sure if I believe that because 30 std drinks is a lethal dose to the average person
---
Maybe, I had only 3 people yesterday - though people are often out sat daytime in fairness.
---
Raider RP.  Or, just an asshat griefer.   
---
Mines in an out of the way place, never happened.
---
When my camp was over near Sunshine Meadows I had two dudes try to shake me down for stuff... raider RP.  I was much lower level and freaked out and left the server.  As it was disconnecting, I hear one say ‚Äúwait, where did he go?‚Äù  I lol at it now üòÇ
---
Well, you can hardly get your stomach pumped, so eating some food (Like a Belgian beer sausage) to absorb some alcohol is probably the best you can get.
---
OK.
---
You killed and ate someone during an event that doesnt allow you to damage other players?
---
Then you went to their CAMP and built even though you cant do that unless you are on their team?
---
Maybe it's not a fake story but it is a not very well told one that leaves out a lot of details. Thus creating plot holes. Thus making it seem fake. 
---
And by the way, you picture evidence doesnt prove anything. You could make that boring shack literally anywhere. 
---
Where do you even get these data? (other than buying from players)
---
Same for me on PC.  150+ levels on two characters and best I got is a SINGLE shot explosive, mid-level damage.  Still need to 3-4 shot most higher enemies.  Usually revert back to melee.  Usually get some stupid assassins (I don't PVP) or low level crowbar or wood armor, etc.
---
Also, I mean like full bottles of vodka and Nukashine, not just your average pint.
---
Also Huntersville and West tek are filled with super mutants for some decent exp and caps.
---
What in the god damn... 
---
I don't even know which are rare?
---
If I pick my nose, is that loot?
---
No item in life is worth the grind, virtual or physical. Having things is not the objective. It's only a plus.
---
I mean you claim to know a lot but you convey very little. Please cite to me where Bethesda said this isn‚Äôt intended, I also read the inside the vault and have never seen this mentioned. I don‚Äôt server hop btw but they pretty much set themselves up for it when they create events like the parade with rare items and a limited time frame. It‚Äôs almost guaranteed people will server hop and it‚Äôs surprising if they didn‚Äôt realize that.
---
 I don‚Äôt work in gaming actually, I do have a job that requires basic comprehension skills. That‚Äôs how I know what the PvP rules are and how to avoid engaging in PvP if I don‚Äôt want to unlike some people who‚Äôd rather not bother and then complain when they get killed legitimately.
---
So it never came across the developers that seven days for a 0.03% chance at a rare mask would basically mean one person would only get the mask. I knew the masks were supposed to be rare but like this is beyond ridiculous.
---
He was using multiple accounts to sell to vendors to gain multiple thousands of caps per day. 
---
Copies of 76 where literally being given away in some countries. There is no sub cost. Those are all mules used to cheat the cap limit of 25k. 
---
Just this morning I had some idiot walking by my camp start trying to destroy my water purifiers. Then when he realized I was at my camp tried to enter my cabin. I server hopped before he did much damage but what was the point ? The part that makes me mad about it is that if it were not for the punishments involved these idiots would be like this is real life. 
---
Oh, just give the man his answer.
---
klc07, they are unbelievably rare. I have done the event over 80 times, and the best I got was 2 berets. The brets are not as hard to get, but you can still see your odds aren't good. In fact, your odds of EVER getting a rare mask from this event are pretty low. So low you could spend every hour of every day until the event ends repeating it, and still likely not ever get even one of the rare masks. Bethesda needs to increase the drop rate, imo. Or only a very few incredibly lucky people will ever get one, they won't ever be traded except for large amounts of real-world money, and it will eventually discourage people from bothering with the event. 
---
XB1
---
I've done the parade once and i dont plan on doing it again honestly. All the enemies were level 10-20 while every single person there including me was 80+. It was the slowest most tedious event I've ever done in fallout. This is an awful event all around.
---
I'm very sorry if you are offended by my comment. I never meant to doubt your kindness but it was all funny and creepy how you started a thing with him, killed and ate him and then took a good care of him lol Indeed, taking care of newbies are really fun and satisfying, helping out leveling up, and even making and giving away a full set of excavator armor and fully modded combat rifles. Especially, around levels of 20 to 40 are quite tough in the game but I might be spoiling their fun of growing stronger by doing too much for them. You treated him very well in that way, bro:)
---
Sounds like maybe you just didn‚Äôt really understand PvP and the cap system before you started leveling up. Obviously Bethesda didn‚Äôt intend to have people hit level 300 within 2 months of playing the game and then run around baiting people into PvP so they could cap farm. You say it ‚Äúpunishes‚Äù you when it‚Äôs working exactly the way it‚Äôs supposed to, and it causes that word to lose its meaning and effect. Realistically, you just don‚Äôt like the way it works and want a special change made just for you. 
---
But she's not on a witch hunt she's just trying to vent to other people who love the game? About ppl who exploit pvp in an assholish way and about a few weird issues around not being able to VATS? On top of this she has been serially griefed a lot in the way that aligns with your own dictionary definition. It's tiresome to see the same posts all the time but she hasn't exactly come on and said "LOL there is a brahmin on the roof of my Sanctuary house gaiz"
---
Yep
---
Really?
---
Mods?  What are these mods you speak of?  Didn't know you could mod the game.  Are you talking OTHER shop items?  I do have a few of those placed around camp
---
The reason I asked him to search is because the community is divided on the matter.   Some say it‚Äôs mathematically imposssible due to how it‚Äôs programmed, some say they have them but won‚Äôt provide proof, some tinfoil hat theories, etc.  
---
Bottom line:  good luck, screenshot if you get any or you won‚Äôt be believed, lol.  And hold onto it because it will be very valuable should you choose to sell later.
---
I don‚Äôt have the patience or time to run the event 100s of times for a mask.   
---
I agree mate, it's ridiculous! Plus, I'm not that desperate to use real world money to buy them ever! Oh well... Let's see how lucky we get then!
---
He shot me after the event. You know how a lot of people try to shoot each other after the parade, he probably saw them one and got inspired. Also he had a PA frame and I was in an outfit, so he probably thought he could out-power me. I know how events prevent PvP, I have posted a lot of times about that this week. I killed him when he kept shooting me just so he's stop. He sought revenge four times, and even followed me to my CAMP where I had to kill him again. The fifth time the "Seeking revenge" thing popped up I sighed sent him a team invite and he accepted it. Then I went to him and built at his CAMP.
---
When I was a low level, I met a couple who built a fusion generator in my CAMP, gave me a lot of armor and built me a PA. I like to treat people the way I have been treated in the game.
---
Yeah. Someone just found my camp at the edge of somewhere and destroyed everything. I leave my door unlocked for visitors, but he wiped it all out. Blew walls open. Had all the explosive ammo and mutations. I tried chasing him down because he had a huge bounty after that, but then he left the server. What a dildo. 
---
ƒ∞t is
---
I would just make spawn locations that arnt the same every single time. 
---
The first time I played everyone made tight little defensive positions around the parade as it moved along expecting to be attacked at any time. 
---
Now, everybody just runs to the spots where the action will eventually happen. 
---
I've complained about this before. I got so frustrated that last time it happened I fired all of my mini-nukes in the direction I saw them go. Didn't get Wanted status so I guess I missed, but I still felt a little better.
---
This is how I met my wife. 
---
Lol troll go back to PvE. I already had the discussion I needed about this. Notice I had a discussion with people and engaged in ideas instead of crying to Bethesda like the post I‚Äôm sure you creeped on me from. 
---
Oh is this would make sense as to why I‚Äôve had so many more griefers coming to blow up my highly detailed CAMP in the past couple weeks :( 
---
A) you can view all mods unless you filter it to show only craftable.
---
B) you can now apply mods without needing the requisite perk, which makes sense because why would you buy a mod if you can just craft it?
---
C) if anyone figures out the comfort stocks let me know because I can't get any of them to work either.
---
Fallout 76 has khakis?
---
The Mr. Handys in Flatwoods are great for aluminum, as are the jar rings in the greenhouses and vault tec building.
---
Honestly, it's not my thing. I did the event for some easy xp but other than that I could care less about a mask. To me I'd rather just play the game than collect something I'll never use. I got the owl mask of corse, but it's just not something I'll use. 
---
They forgot to give them ammo 
---
the exact same thing happened to me right  now....
---
So true, I hadn‚Äôt noticed 
---
However if you wear PA with no helmet it still rains on your "visor" lol
---
There's this bright red hat I've seen two or three people running around in. It's like a cloche hat if you know what that is...where did people get it from?
---
I think that‚Äôs the one thing I really miss in 76 we need another three dog 
---
Oh no not at all.
---
That's why I don't give them too much. I feel that a weapons bench is the most useful at early stage, as well as a cooking station and a bed. He also wasn't investing into CAMPs at all, maybe he didn't know how it'd work, so giving him a push in the right direction was what I thought would be the best.
---
Also, I didn't start the PvP, he kept shooting me and kept seeking revenge after I killed him, so I needed him to stop losing his caps. As for the eating thing, I just took the cannibal perk for the first time in any Fallout game and I am having too much fun with it.
---
I did during my first couple runs. 
---
No change 
---
Different alts, I've got a big guns build, a melee build, pvp, etc.
---
Plus, slot of legendaries I get I mule away, or stims, supplies,  etc.
---
My main is a melee/crafter so I make alot of items and then store them till needed.
---
Such salt over a mask. How about the more important part, that it brought a lot of people together that never would have played the game together otherwise. That to me is vastly more important than the masks.
---
Wrong. If a player has a bounty and no caps. Upon being killed valuable items in that players stash will drop. Ores, treasure maps, ammo etc.
---
I have furious mr handy buzz blade, i think it cap on 2.5x
---
If I have gotten or get one of the rare ones, why would I post it on here to have half the people bitching and complaining about how unfair it is that they didnt get one instead, and half the people claiming that I must have cheated to get it? 
---
At this point, anyone with rare masks is just going to be a pariah because of all these unfair drop rate posts.
---
No worries, let me know if you need anything else. 
---
Never using vats is - in the current form of F76 - like saying you refuse to breath because you dislike the smell of air. Well, good luck.
---
All I‚Äôm saying is every ‚Äúexploit‚Äù she mentioned is part of the game. When you claim a workshop you can be engaged in PvP, this means they can damage you and your teams structures without incurring a bounty. When you use a stealthboy or chameleon armor you can‚Äôt be hit in vats, I don‚Äôt buy the invisible people argument. 
---
Instead of asking for help on staying out of these situations she claims it‚Äôs because of dupers even though that has no bearing on these situations. She asks Bethesda for help when it‚Äôs part of the game for now and they‚Äôre already releasing changes to Pacifist mode soon. False reports of griefing back up the already slow support staff when they could be suspending people who actually grief people. 
---
I‚Äôm all for venting, I have posts where I vent aswell but I don‚Äôt claim things that aren‚Äôt true and beg Bethesda to change it. I engage with the community looking for answers so I can submit a ticket to Bethesda with my suggestions. 
---
Yeah...u cant assume a players gear based in their level.
---
At this point every annoying person who tries to instigate you has bought or traded for. A tse shotgun or bloodied super destructo power fist or something.
---
Ive basicly spent the last 100 levels grinding for decent gear and weapons.....got maybey 1 that i can use with my build.   
---
Op...what do u use? Im on xbox and have some decent stuff saved up. Not duped 
---
Don't know yet but Ive heard that the plans spawn in the toxic valley so try events and spots mentioned in this thread. You can also get a random BoS combat armor drop from the glassed cavern once a day on a body at the end of the cave but you can't control which varient ( light, heavy, sturdy) or what piece.
---
My point is that IF you want to trade, then you surely must have proof of obtaining it legit 
---
I will have a gander when I am back online.
---
I just got this hahahahahahah 
---
Yes it would be nice to have a global trading hub in some large building with computers and stuff so you could travel there and put items up for sale
---
/r/nocontext
---
What‚Äôs wrong?
---
No offence but if you are afraid of TSE's then your opinion is skewed in bad direction as you are not PvP oriented nor experienced (at least in this wonderful mess of a game, I'm not trying to undermine your general gaming experience, I'm just saying F76 balance is more complicated than 'too much TSE'). TSE is now medicore tier.
---
"So they lose nothing when they're killed."
---
You can't easily replace a large blueprint, I find it always easier to rebuild completely but then again building is one of my favourite things to do.
---
As for the no build zone, if you build as close to one as possible and then move your CAMP workbench afterwards you could put it in the no build zone which then brings up the error.  Had it three times before I realised near Helvetia, not moved my CAMP workbench and never had it since.
---
On my main when I was 55 I got a TSE combat shotty, the next week a got a TSE handmade and a mob later I got a TSE Rad rifle this was at lvl 62. Was running Whitesprings in all instances.
---
Then shit drops till lvl 125 now I'm getting good drops again, Instigating, Bloodied explosive, etc.
---
Have NEVER got any good armor pieces have always had to buy from someone. 
---
My wife who teams with me gets legendaries like candy, last night alone a furious explosive. 50 cal.
---
Drop rate mechanics are nuttier than squirrel shit in this game.
---
Appreciate it but I‚Äôm on Xbox. So it sounds like it‚Äôs not a bug, it‚Äôs designed to do this, it‚Äôs just a design that could leave you kinda stuck. Welp time to start server hopping and hope I get lucky. 
---
I was in a nuke zone near The Lumber Company. It was one of the first I‚Äôd entered &amp; I was still pretty low level. Someone logged in &amp; their camp appeared, I figured I would rest inside for a moment. Turns out they didn‚Äôt like that so they kept slapping me &amp; in my hazmat suit it was actually wearing me down quickly. I gave them the no emote but they wouldn‚Äôt let up so I ran away in the direction of some ore I spotted. That attracted the attention of a scorchbeast &amp; as I hastily retreated the way I‚Äôd come it decided to focus on the other players camp &amp; started attacking relentlessly. He logged out because of what I assume was his desire to not repair his Decontamination arch. So he deserved kind of deserved it but still..
---
Thank you.
---
Oh and guys... *Her...
---
LOL!
---
Everyone is running around with duped TSEs that the know were not obtained legitimately, and no one cares about that any more. So what's the difference. The masks are part of the game now, officially. They are no longer dev room only items, and shouldn't raise any red flags. If you really want one, and see someone selling, then buy it. 
---
I think opening the doors and shutters is pretty funny.  Thanks for the PSA! 
---
Ok
---
Hope he made that shot count.
---
Most of us feel your pain. How many hours did you spend before you posted? I was in the same boat and was maybe 20 hours. No one has gotten one and all the post about two or three players getting one of everyone who is still playing FO76 can‚Äôt be confirmed. The drop rate for these must be bugged. The next time Bethesda has an event like this and if your still playing the game have fun, but think twice about grinding it for something cool.
---
This is why I have demountable structures thanks to blueprints! :)
---
Depends if there's anything good up in there
---
Duh..
---
I haven‚Äôt seen anyone drop treasure maps and ammo but even if that‚Äôs the case it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that the system is flawed and is in need of change. Seems most of the community feels the same way. I don‚Äôt want some worthless ore and ammo, I want the caps I was promised by the bounty baby!
---
Stop being so entitled, Bethesda owes you nothing. You already get a unique award in the form of masks. What‚Äôs the point in have a rare item if everyone has one? What‚Äôs the point in doing the event if you can just buy it in the atomic shop after? Don‚Äôt be silly.
---
It was.  In BETA.
---
Like the radios, they removed it before going live.
---
Hopefully, like the radios, they add them in again.
---
I actually think it still works for workshops, though.  If you drop a welcome mat, I'm pretty sure you fast travel to it in workshops.
---
It's been a while since I bothered with a workshop, so that might not still be true.
---
Tried this left different masked robots alive like 2 or 3 even 1 with mask. Nothing so far
---
IMO it's a dumb thing to obsess over. Just play the game and have fun, don't try to min-max everything. 
---
I think part of the problem was that OP mentioned the other players being invisible without chameleon effects and weren't targetable or hittable. That sounds a little unusual to me and not like normal PvP tbh. Everyone's aware that owning a workshop opens up the chance for someone to else to claim it which is fine and all but of the claimer has that level of advantage being un-hittable then that seems like something that's not normal or really expected. I've done my PvP research and I can't find anything about potentially bugged out people
---
I tried to reinstall early on and it didn't fix an issue, also my pictures were deleted.  Didn't effect the save game though.
---
Since then I always back up my pics by taking a screenshot, also because I always run out of space.
---
They need to ‚Äúgift‚Äù them to some people after drinking vintage nukashine at an event. 
---
No, it doesn't. We're getting player vending soon enough. All auction houses do is massively inflate/deflate ingame economies unless handled VERY carefully
---
Do you have any of the rare masks?
---
Honestly, it‚Äôs freaking water not ultracite 
---
I have 3 purifiers going at my camp and if someone wants to partake it‚Äôs fine with me.  I can‚Äôt ccme close to consuming all I generate. 
---
Whether legit or not, a jester one sold for 80k lol
---
Stealth boys &amp; phantom devices, you can still hit them by aiming btw. I kill players like that all the time thinking they‚Äôre cute, perception ftw 
---
This is so unbelievably wholesome and lovely. Apart from the dickhead who blew the door off my camp to get inside (when the door wasn‚Äôt even locked), I‚Äôve only ever experienced people being kind and generous and this game and it‚Äôs just awesome üòç
---
It sucks what happened, but its not flawed. Theres pacifist mode, you can get almost free repairs by moving your camp. Its a post-nuclear survival game, let's not lose sight that some people can't be trusted.
---
Destroying other peoples camps is a 100% intended feature everyone is aware of. Thats why you can send nukes to camps, and why theres perks that increase your damage output to other peoples camp/workshop objects.
---
Sorry for your loss, don't feed the yao guai.
---
I think it's about 15 hours each (with my husband) grinding the event since the start... Probably more.. We're still grinding now. I highly doubt I'd be going through this process again, especially if there is literally no chance to get it. 
---
So psyched when I found it, only for it to have a locked door and nothing else...
---
The issue I found out really fast that there was no interesting things in FO76. The locations are fantastic but the content of the locations are all the same, just more boring loot.
---
Greek letter plans cost?
---
Have to agree, just turn in some technical data and you'll get some, too
---
I have my main and I have another low level one if my low level friend ever wants to play. 
---
Or that most casuals are unable to properly grind for it.
---
I don't know, dude. ^^theres a military circuit board in the Whitesprings that has been a stationary object since launch, and it just became lootable 
---
Haha yeah I have high PER too, and can target phantom chameleon and steal boyed players but op mentioned that these guys weren't vats-able or whatever the word is. Doesn't sound like a normal case. 
---
Tangent, is killing players for the caps a good way of getting caps? Or is it more of a content thing you're looking for?
---
They're console players. Every kid gets a console on Christmas. Not everyone can build a good PC 
---
Oh my God FINALLY
---
Additionally, you can fast travel to Helvetia, and that usually resets the sloth corpse so you can loot it.
---
Most probably, yes.
---
Ok....subsequent play throughs were fun! 
---
Bro you‚Äôre talking to the wrong guy, I understand camps can get leveled, I told the OP about the new changes in pacifist mode and how to avoid this situation in the future. I explained to him why people do this and that it‚Äôs a function of the game so your comment is old news. 
---
I merged that in with my complaint about zero cap PvP exploiters which is what you initially commented on but now you‚Äôre changing the subject? Not really sure what your goal here is except troll because you‚Äôre not adding anything of substance to this conversation. 
---
That's not griefing. That's playing within the realm of what is possible le in the game. 
---
Dont be a baby. 
---
Life is more fun when you get that stick out of your ass and complain less. Try to enjoy more and less anger.
---
I have done this by accident before because my joints dislocate super easy and I find the emote thing really awkward to use. I always apologise though!
---
Best love story ever üò¢
---
I was never drawn in by the masks honestly . I personally find them ugly as fk, i just wanted the beret and the plans which i have now so i really dont have any reason to do it.
---
Is that the door you can hear music coming from behind it?
---
That's not victim blaming. Jesus Christ there are so many entitled babies around here!
---
This has been suggested a lot but what I haven‚Äôt seen suggested is maybe you have to prevent them from taking any damage what so ever or at least a certain percentage. I feel like that would make more sense than letting some die.
---
IKR
---
Read the latest Inside the Vault.
---
111418
---
My bad, mistaken you for OP.
---
Sorry if you feel trolled.
---
I'm kinda multitasking here, so my goal is just passing time between loading screens lol.
---
I don‚Äôt engage in workshop PvP for the most part, but I find its fun to experience everything a game  has to offer. And when that game has legendary effects that are specifically geared towards PvP then that‚Äôs something I‚Äôll partake in aswell. I love all the fallouts but like many I wanted one where I could play with my friends. We like to battle each other and sometimes take on other groups, a lot of times we save people like the OP from raiders that claim their workshops. But that‚Äôs all they are, Raiders not griefers. 
---
I prefer to farm legendarys and sell them on reddit, taking people‚Äôs caps isn‚Äôt really a motivator for me but I do enjoy a good fight. 
---
Sure it‚Äôs possible with the game mechanics that doesn‚Äôt make it not rude or inconsiderate lol.
---
Griefing is just causing GRIEF to other players. Insisting on PvPing those who play on PEACEFUL even as they ask you not to is causing grief to those players and ruining their gaming experience. Just cause it‚Äôs possible in game doesn‚Äôt mean you get a free pass to be a dickhead.
---
These videos, were they made before the two shot  explosive nerf?
---
Bunch of whiners because a Rare item is actually rare for once
---
Nah my b, I pissed off a group of causal players who don‚Äôt understand workshop PvP mechanics and now they‚Äôre trolling every post I ever made lol. It‚Äôs funny to me but kinda sad at the same time. I appreciate you dropping the knowledge about players dropping maps and stuff because I didn‚Äôt know that. 
---
I've never seen a duper and I've never been attacked by another player or had another player attack my camp.
---
I feel like Bethesda has entirely eliminated dupers and griefers.
---
See what I did there.
---
Absolutely.   
---
The Crashed Space Station was the first indication I had that something was wrong with this game. During the BETA, I made a b-line straight for it because, spoilers be damned, I wanted to see what it was. I fully expected to get killed by roving gangs of robots, or power armored ghouls, or cyborg deathclaws or something cool and deadly. But...nothing. And I got there and there were a few enemies running around but...nothing.   
---
That's when I started to realize the core issue with this game. It's not bugs, it's not how PVP was implimented, it's not the weapon mod grind.   
---
It's that this is a beautiful map with no content.   
---
The world is beautiful. I love every inch of the map. But when you actually look closer at it, its mostly just empty. Barely a handful of quests, npcs, stories, or dungeons to really explore. The world was masterfully crafted, but the GAME was unfinished. There should be an epic boss or questline centered around the space station, but there's nothing. It's just a static object decorating the map and another fight against either generic ghouls, super mutants, or zombies.   
---
I can think of one situation where it's acceptable to destroy a camp: whitespring golf course turret camps. Other than that, I agree. I hope that when they make damage changes, they also remove the ability to build close to the golf club. Your situation? They were dicks.
---
I'd love to meet up and see what you have that I'm missing.
---
Greek letters are the poor mans neon.
---
Canned foods should probably weight more than fresh foods as the trade off
---
A fair point, game does need some optimization (Can't even do alt+f4 without it trying to kill my pc)
---
Ok thanks for the tips. Yes my main weapon is a machete, i use the guns for when i run into high level opponents 
---
Greek letter set is ok, doesnt have all the letters in the english alphabet so you may have to get creative haha. Big bold letters tho
---
Yeah the guy with that pole hook I posted about on an earlier part of the thread I tried to buy it off of him
---
Yah I think you can give up on this one unless you really like taking part in Fasnacht and the awesome marching band music!
---
No worries man. If u know how to tag op in this thread would you mind so I can get the message across?
---
Hope you enjoy the rest of your night/day. And that does sound annoying haha
---
Ah great thank you! I‚Äôll look into that
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Wil-wild and crazy kids
---
What's the going rate? It says 100, I would give it to you for 75 caps. Or 1 stable flux of any kind.
---
Where is there intentional grief being caused anywhere in the OP story? Is it where a workshop is being contested (which is their whole point? Did I miss where it said these "griefers" followed them from server to server to follow them around and harass them? 
---
No. All I see is someone salty about how they were beat several times. 
---
There is literally nothing called PEACEFUL (as you have for some reason condescendingly capitalized). There is pacifist mode which does not allow you to hurt other players as a first strike. It doesn't keep you from being attacked. And it doesnt keep you out of a PVP situation if you are dumb enough to hit back even though you cant hurt them. 
---
Yup! You'll have to be a bit more creative, as its missing certain English letters. But it's enough to get by in a pinch.
---
Maybe with a bloodied explosive build.
---
I use a sneak Instigating explosive sniper build and that kills any (but scorchbeasts) 1 shot
---
Admittedly I suck at reddit, good at the passing people off part bad at the intricacies. I‚Äôll see what I can do tho because OP actually wanted knowledge and not just complaining about how unfair it was. Have a nice night yourself!
---
FO76 was my first positive experience of an online game which I now adore. A fantastic community of friends I have made, plus lovely randommers who drop bags of goodies for lower level players to help them out. High level players offering to help on missions. The market is flooded with specific games DESIGNED for pvp and actively promoted as such. I just wish players who want that game style would not ruin everyone elses experiences on what is generally a co op style multiplayer only game for me. 
---
Yes, we know workshops can be claimed by others. I never take a workshop that isn't unclaimed, I simply want xp and resources. If a player comes near my workshop I waive, say hello, offer to share the resources and they can of course get so by helping me on the defend events.  If I wanted to PvP I would shoot them when they entered the workshop etc. But I don't so why can't players realise that not everyone wants PvP regardless of if the game allows it.  Just because I walk into a McDonalds doesn't mean I am force fed a sodding Big mac - I can chose to have chicken nuggets or even a salad. Respect for other gamers and other humans would make the gaming community a better place. 
---
Where can I get it from??
---
Just remember to gloat, after looting his corpse.
---
Why in the hell are you walking around with all that stuff?
---
No prob, if you are on ps4 i have both the neon and greek set and can put up letter for you if you want. Otherwise biv gives you the set upon completing the new alcohol quests, i may have an extra plan for the set as well
---
The 5 you‚Äôre not getting.
---
I‚Äôve had great encounters at the event. But elsewhere...
---
It would have to be a separate station.  
---
Atomic Radio! 
---
You could even make it like post apocalyptic Spotify and require a monthly charge in Atoms!
---
I'll buy the Greek letters, and some others. I can't fast travel though
---
you cheated and got banned, deal with it scumbag.
---
Sigh. Is no one reading? Like I said in the post, we JUST finished Scorched Earth. They waited for us to loot the Queen and the surrounding enemy bodies, then killed us. There is no Stash out at Prime.
---
Just a shame there‚Äôs only the one kind instead of the different heights we had on 4
---
Worked it out you type u/name
---
Vic the alcoholic robot. You meet him during the nukashine quest. And he has daily quests after that. If you are on Ps4, I have a few extra sets I can give you. Otherwise, plenty of people will have extras as well. They are fairly common, so shouldnt be expensive.
---
Ah I‚Äôm on Xbox one unfortunately, what is biv? Haven‚Äôt heard of that one before?
---
eh.. nevermind
---
How much caps or material would it take to acquire one from you?
---
i always sit up there in the lounge if i have to do something real quick. quicker than quiting and re logging in. 
---
I don‚Äôt understand why folks agree to join some strangers party.  Virtual or real.
---
If this was in real life, you‚Äôd be featured in your episode of discovery, murder.
---
Near Flatswood, underneath the fertile soil.
---
Now I know your from the brotherhood, so you'll need two squads of paladins to get inside, and I still suspect you'll take 90% causalities. 
---
Wow aggressive much. I was just asking for information not fighting my punishment. Even though I don't believe I should have been banned. Your comment shows who of us is scum I'm afraid to say
---
I can read just fine. 
---
You got killed by slap damage? Not sure I'd throw that around. Or do you mean you hit the guy and he hit you back? You know, like the rules of the game establish? That's not theft. 
---
HA! You are right my good sir... Still not sure about showing those who are alive for longest time...but i guess its a nice way to prepare some traps ;) Thank you for showing me this...i missed this part 
---
Yeah i understand your point very well and it's true of course. But I also opened it up because about the upcoming PVP servers. It came in my mind how silly it is and that no one really double thought this whole effects out. It looks more like random than a plan behind it.
---
This exactly, thank you for explaining it far better than I could. 
---
Oh no. Not this mask thing again. Get over it. The amount of entitlement some people feel is crazy. Super rare means super rare. End of.
---
BC she doesn't have a portable stash box and doesn't want to nip to the nearest station every 5 minutes?
---
Go to morgantown and right next vault tech university is big al‚Äôs tattoo parlor, on the back wall there is a poster next to the back door, read the poster then go inside the back entrance. The poster starts a new quest line which is available daily. You will def want to do these every day! Once inside the tattoo parlor the secret speak easy entrance is behind the nuka cola machine.
---
One look at your karma is all I need to know 
---
You mean three
---
Ahhh I see, thankyou!
---
I think it‚Äôs associated with your Named account NOT your toons name. 
---
Ah sorry bud ps4 here
---
I hope everyone who was banned misses more content.
---
Shouldn't you by lying on the steps of Fort Defiance instead of trying to extort classified intel from your superiors?
---
Won't get a bounty if you are currently on their team.
---
Killing the cow destroys the Pen.  If you are on a team, you don't get a wanted bounty for killing your friend's cow though.
---
I have watched many new players get 5 cap bounties for just killing the cow at my base.
---
Do you submit one data at a time or do the data stack in your inventory without the game showing you?
---
I'm sorry you feel that way. The toxicity here is stupid are you 12 ? 
---
Ok thx
---
I did like the answer of running away and living makes you legendary.
---
However, I have found that legendary assaultrons do this too. This programming forces you to chase the legendary, often through a mob, as opposed to being able to pick them off from a distance. 
---
It's an MIRV. An experimental Weapon that well... doesn't work very well. Convert it to a Fatman and you have a near weightless Mini Nuke Launcher. It's hardly putting a dent in your stash capacity
---
Y would you want to be lower lvl to play with your friend?
---
This plague me in the beginning as well. What you have to do, I believe, is to hit enter or (I don‚Äôt know what on the PS4) in order to advance. It literally is just a question of mashing a button when you get to the bottom of the login. I know I haven‚Äôt an explained this well because it‚Äôs been a while but you can definitely look this up easily. It‚Äôs a common bug.
---
Ah ok igy thx
---
I will never understand how the BoS has all this technology yet get wiped by Scorched with pipe pistols
---
Engaging in a fair fight or even fighting against someone more powerful can be interesting for sure, and a challenge. I've gone up against some people twice my level with TSEs and sentinel builds and as long as I can actually deal damage to them, that's fine once in a while. I feel like a large part of OPs post is that if you can't engage back then it becomes something not intended for the game - if someone wants to fight and keeps trying then fine, I'll throw down. If someone attacks me and due to whatever reason they literally can't be attacked back then I'd call that something different. That's not really fair fighting, with fair being a really relative word. It's not what Bethesda seems to have intended with how they describe and deliver PVP. 
---
Best way to get caps I've found is selling union hats. 1 cloth can get you 13-16 caps and it's piss-easy
---
Ok, cool. I think I understand what you are suggesting. I'll give it a try and see how I go, thanks.
---
I want to be about the same level as him.
---
You have no idea what the drop rate is since you have no access to the server code which is the only code that matters in this context. Your client does not make any decisions about it whatsoever, otherwise you could just change the client code and get the items you wanted. If that was possible people would already have done it.
---
Yes I‚Äôm on Xbox. 
---
I was being generous, thought they might have upgraded your flashlights. Was too busy beating a deathclaw to death with our standard issue with our standard issue enclave steel (Insert genital of choice here)
---
I‚Äôve seen folks attempt to pvp me when I‚Äôm busy doing something else.
---
I‚Äôll ask what they want, if no response, blocked. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt make any sense me but oküòÇ
---
&gt;Where is there intentional grief being caused anywhere in the OP story? Is it where a workshop is being contested (which is their whole point? Did I miss where it said these "griefers" followed them from server to server to follow them around and harass them? 
---
Read the post the first incident took place at a workshop and shouldn‚Äôt have been mentioned.  The other two were greifing. 
---
I believe its rather mix of underestimating the players and this being so complex that simultanously most of the plaherbase in confused on how stuff works. I consider myself a F76 nolife and yet I am aware of at leat four different F76 features where my understanding of them is "here be dragons".
---
I find if I do a complete full circuit of whitesprings (I know it‚Äôs over used) by the time I‚Äôm done the ghouls Have resplendent At The start and so it can go on forever.
---
Thank you  looks like I won't be playing Tuesday. 
---
Okay, I might be on another hour or so for now, but will be on for awhile tomorrow for sure as well. I didn't realize plans weigh so much. 
---
You‚Äôre welcome :)
---
I don't understand the criticism. It's a Fatman that fires several smaller mini nukes per shot. Try using it on a group of clustered enemies way down below you.
---
Cute.
---
Upvote for "assisted suicide machine."
---
I hasn‚Äôt even thought about this. That would be a next level troll, now I‚Äôm grateful I only had to repair all. 
---
Okay, well, if you send me a photo of where your camp is I can swing by tomorrow.
---
Legendary walking cane ! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Did you have ppl in your team? Ive found that it multiplies by team members for me.
---
Solo the price is correct, 
---
Team of two, double
---
Team of 4, x4.
---
Could be coincidence. Either way, still broken. 
---
PS4?
---
So what. Its a cosmetic item. Life goes on. I am sure a lot of dupers where trying to get the rare mask just to dupe and sell it on ebay. Must have been funny to watch them grind like crazy 24/7. So this thought alone was worth it.
---
Why not both for assassins? Maybe a sneak multiplier boost as a property it has?
---
Like a train station vendor. Oh, sellers want more caps? To buy what exactly? Oh, other and more stuff at higher prices than you could buy from a train station vendor.
---
Perhaps the answer is the train station vendor price spread us out of whack. Buy is way too low, sell is a little high.
---
I wonder if the train station vendor price spread would adjust if all if the items weren't being taken out if the game economy?
---
Such salt over a mask that will collect dust in our stash boxes within a month 
---
Are you on Xbox? 
---
Or just put in the burn barrel. Fucking horrible waste of money.
---
"I built a shack for us. Out in the woods "
---
Get this man Ryan Gosling and a movie deal NOW!
---
Yes, it's so toxic of me and so immature of me to feel that people who cheated/abused and online service I paid for should receive a punishment that has some weight to it. 
---
That's fair, only so many times you can listen to some of them, others, I could listen to constantly
---
It's really shitty of buggedthesda to give such low drop rates for the rare masks. I've run the event somewhere between 40-49 and met a lot of people and nobody had any of the rare masks. It's very shitty of them
---
I have one in my stash as well, never really had a good look at it, just thought it was a fat man that used mini nukes..what and where are these smaller mini nukes of which you speak?
---
Phew!
---
Hopefully they fix that trash can that isn't lootable
---
I'm not sure what bug you're talking about but if you mean autoscrapping bulked junk, that's not bugged, it's working as intended. Remains to be seen if they change it back to the way it was. They tie it to crafting. The game now considers bulk materials in the individual count and automatically scraps bulked materials when you need them. 
---
For my money I would rather just expand the favorites functionality to block auto scrapping.
---
Ok. I'm on now. Join me. My GT is Bigshotsasse. 
---
Dunno if it's actually a reference, but the station in the 100 is similarly shaped and it also crashes into the earth in about the same way. 
---
Idk if this happens at other places but wher i have my camp animals always spawn. I have seen everything from frogs to radstags. Yesterday a bunch of cats spawned witch i didnt even know was possible. Now i have 1 turret in my camp and its placed so it can only shoot at something that walks infront of my house. So a bunch of cats spawned and cus the devs smoke crack the cats are hostile so my turret just murder a innocent cat for no reason. 
---
It is rather yes. Considering I'm not fighting my punishment even though I don't believe I deserve it.i was able to play 1 session on the 5th of this month and recorded the session if you want to see the inventory that makes me deserve to be banned? 
---
It‚Äôs as easy as popping a berry mentat and lettin that trigger finger squeeze. I get why it would put people off, I don‚Äôt like fighting defenseless people, but raiders do and they‚Äôre a part of fallout lore. A lot of the complaints are actually being addressed in future updates so at least there‚Äôs that. Yeah Bethesda screwed up a lot about this game but personally I don‚Äôt find workshop PvP to be one of those, and posts like these don‚Äôt actually result in discussions on what the best fixes might be.
---
A low-key spot people seem to never mention for lead is the monorail elevator. ~120 units every time I go, you need to use either manual elevator, go to top floor available, and cross the wooden bridges. Every point on the bridges where a gap between the monorail-support things, there's a few weights supporting it. Good spot for concrete too.
---
I have encountered one person with the sun mask, and have done the parade prob 50 times, i have a pic on ps4 of it if you need proof of its existence but yes i agree drop rates suck for it
---
They could at least add all the songs from previous fallouts. 
---
Lol you‚Äôre safe from my toxic ass for now buddy!
---
Wowbuywhy
---
Someone just tried charging me 300 caps on them. Some people are so cap hungry. 
---
Pretty normal to not waste good protein 
---
No, I was solo. But that's interesting to know, either way
---
It might be worth it on a shotgun because of the individual pellets but its probably not worth it on anything else.

I think this post highlights a potential bug of people being invincible and using that in a way that Bethesda didn't intend, and also using it to deliberately damage other people's experience. Yeah theres raiders, yeah if Its possible to shoot them back then fine. But if you CANT then there's something up. Berry mentats won't do anything against someone who can't be seen or shot or tambourined to death or meleed by binoculars. I'm fine with raiders or people who wanna shoot other people and workshop PvP and the nature of the whole thing. I'm less fine with people using Bethesda's naturally buggy product to their advantage and not giving other even a slight chance of engaging in the OTHER side of PvP: defending the workshop. 
---
I have gotten most of my good stuff on here. Just searching the market. Makes life way easier haha
---
Also, are you on PS4?
---
Drew ghouls on an player who was afk while using a vendor and stole his junk (thousands of junk) when he died.
---
In my defense I thought for sure he would come back to the game before the slap damage killed him.
---
Man, i help people out all the time, build fucking full excavator suits, drop bags of 30 legendaries, 100s of material snd chems etc and barely ever get a thanks. When i read these posts it blows my mind.
---
Tbh, it sounds like nothing short of a video of the entire exchange would win you over, my dude
---
Eh, more or less. I think its fair-ish. It's a strat. Have a decoy draw fire, learn enemy positions, and strike. I do think it needs a nerf. You wanna deal all 300+ damage from your tse handmade? Get tf down here. Other wise, have the advantage of distance, but at the cost of like 25% of the original damage. Kinda like damage drop off, but active when a bullet goes into a workshop, not when it was in it when the gun fired
---
Or it's just rare, and you have the % is drops each time your trying. It's not if something has a 1% drop you're guaranteed to get it if you do something 100 times xD
---
The F76 community are some of the most entitled people I've run across in gaming. This is not a rare thing in gaming for there to be events with rare and hard to come by items..
---
No. They wernt. 
---
In the second he got jacked and they took his stuff. This would have required the OP to have hit their attacker at some point. Maybe they did it accidentally and the other person decided to hit back. Maybe the other person hit first and the OP retaliated but lost. Either way, those are the rules set forth from the beginning. Are they griefers because they took the junk? Again, that's part of the game. 
---
In the third they got ambushes at their camp. Again, it may be a sick move but it's part of the game. If OP died in that engagement then, again, they engaged and lost. 
---
People being better than you isnt griefing. 
---
It's a saying!
---
MIRV is a modified Fat Man. It fires, I think, 8 smaller mini nukes.
---
Their name is MODUS and they're my creepy friend :(
---
The mine where uranium fever takes place usually has 20 or more mile miners with shotguns on them. 
---
Considering the post that you commented on relents that it could be true (just a boring telling) I would say your assessment would be pretty wrong. 
---
Cigarettes are bad mmmkay
---
Guys...ever think those masks were ONLY for the robots... that we've been conned by data miners?
---
You‚Äôre over reacting, unless you have a decon shower there is no reason to get mad about your camp being destroyed. The only other slightly hard thing to repair is crops and even then you can just go to Morgantown.
---
It‚Äôs not a bug it happens when you have Pacifist enabled and have your workshop claimed. Similar to being wanted during an event, players can do damage to you but you can‚Äôt damage them back. Point taken tho, I actually approached this post legitimately wanting to help educate the OP on how to avoid this in the future and was met by nothing but hate. I call it like I see it, fake internet points aside. 
---
I mean, it is basically Wickerman.
---
Fine. 
---
But don't cry when you die and lose it. It's just junk. There is literally nothing irreplaceable. 
---
It‚Äôs the good people in the FO76 community that makes the game.  
---
Likely just a decision on Bethesda's part. Likely trying to keep cigarettes out of the minds of today's youth. It's a noble cause.
---
Pardon my ignorance 
---
You acknowledge your crime but don‚Äôt agree w/guilt?
---
Fwiw, the concepts  you struggle with are, remorse and contrition.
---
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY your ban hammer status, is in limbo.
---
A notice e to all Enclave members: 
---
You are all Nazis. Thank you. 
---
Saw that late last night as well.
---
Fair point especially in the new speakeasy. Solid Snake was always allowed to smoke. Sure, you got a D.O.T. from it but it was a worthy distraction when you were in cover!
---
Oh shi........
---
I wanna just round this off by saying I get your point but the thing I keep focusing on is that OP wasn't able to see or hit the others. That's not pacifist related. It really sounds like a bug or something to me and it sucks OP went through that. I'm sure normally OP could fight back which is fine but in this case couldn't. Something seems fishy about it
---
I submit data one at a time.
---
G R I E F E R S
---
I agree that there needs to be some sort of downside to drinking more alcohol when you're already under the affects of alcohol.
---
Maybe it should fill your food and drink bars with red kind of like radiation does to your health bar. That way you could drink 1 beer in a pinch to relive some dehydration but drinking more would make you worse off.  The more you drink the more it fills.
---
It would go away slowly over time, but sleeping would remove it much quicker. Kind of like sleeping off a hangover in real life.
---
Are we? Speak for yourself. There are people who play for fun not for profit. I don't care about the masks. Stop crying like a little baby because you don't have a rare item you obviously need to feel special. 
---
Absolutely, fuck Bethesda on this one, not 1 single confirmed drop on Xbox... casts an awfully suspicious glow on the few "legitimate" ps4 drops. 
---
Pretty much nothing bothers me. I leave my door open all the time if something gets destroyed then i just rebuild it got plenty of junk to do it. Most of the time my place is damaged free.
---
I‚Äôve seen a level 430 odd.
---
I saw a 526 few weeks ago, someone doesn't have a life lol.
---
LOL but injectables are okay? It's just kind of funny don't you think? Not trying to crap on the game just tired of picking up packs of cigarettes with out the full experience of smoking them.
---
If that guy was to get it legitimately, do you really think he would sell it. 
---
ah, just checked it out on the wiki..same ammo type, but you fire it above your target and then it splits into 4 mini minis and falls straight down..hmm, interesting!
---
This. Its funny how people crave for items they did not even know of a month ago and only want because they are rare. If Bethesda would not includet the rare one at all they would be much happier. Think of it. 
---
It‚Äôs like people don‚Äôt understand that these are rare to get. 
---
Imma actually do it, at least I could do it better than Bethesda. 
---
One of the community managers has forwarded (previously) this onto the dev team!
---
I don't have a post link but I've seen them say it. Hopefully we get this sometime soon.
---
Not at all i Acknowledge my account is suspended. I deny any crime but looking at other threads I know every One here is seen as guilty. All I am asking for is information on what happened when we were allowed back in and then suspended again. Anyone who doesn't know I'm not sure why they are commenting and pushing their opinions that I already know 
---
Well, I already got one myself: Big B's Rest Stop, behind the counter of the little Super Duper Mart....
---
Yeah that what most people are thinking now, or that they‚Äôre not even in the game. 
---
r/choosimgbeggers
---
I really wish you could scrap ammo. Bunch of .38 I‚Äôd love to convert to 308 or .50
---
I knew it made a difference but not that much. Damn.
---
Difference is they arent called drugs they had to change the name to chems to keep the similar idea out of kids heads that drugs are good and Australia nae naed Bethesda and said they cant sell fallout games if it contains the word drug
---
Have them frequently after a player drops a nuke. Maybe in a set area around the nuke for an hour or two after.
---
Omg thank you I've farmed so many raider armor pieces jus to scrap n see all the skins for em
---
How much does that loop (or other users loops) give as a payout? So other users can determine if they want to partake.
---
Well spotted!
---
Having a similar issue but instead have the added issue of Cap Collector not actually activating at all and getting about only 18 caps a cache. Weird.
---
The next patch should bring in Adderall for plus 5 perception.
---
These sightings are interesting.
---
It's the damned bloodied melee builds. Mutations, radi-cool, melee perks, bloodied weapon, inscisor too I think, and it turns a combat knife into a can opener. But I mean they do sacrifice health and become glass cannons. And you could get blocker to live through more melee hits. So I cant really say if it's broken, op, strong, or balanced. I kinda lean towards op, mostly cause I got griefed through 2 servers (forgot about block button) and was insta killed each time. Even tho everyone says it's broken, we havent tried it ourselves, so it makes it easy to complain. But no, pvp in an rpg has to be about the weapon at least somewhat, or it becomes cod or r6.
---
I'm on my way
---
How do you join the enclave on reddit ?  
---
So their mate doesn't get one-shotted by enemies on respawn?
---
They‚Äôre still on the robots...
---
If you don't place the camp again and they remove the "no-build zone" after the event finishes your CAMP should reappear as it was before.
---
Same thing if you decide to remain on a server where your camp can't be placed because someone else owns the area, if you don't drop a new camp when you rejoin a server the space is available you will get your camp back.
---
Wait until it's fermented then drink it and do what it says.
---
I've attempted the above, and done some further investigation on-line, and it seems the problem I'm having is different to the one others have had.
---
The ones others have had are to do with getting the novice tape, and the terminal not having it being obvious you press the enter key/controller button to progress to the next page. I have the novice tape, which should allow me to log into the terminal to get my next question objectives, but it's not providing me with log-in options.
---
I think the giant death bats were the ones giving them problems tbh - and scorched mirelurk queens etc etc 
---
Thats just pure speculation from your side because you don't want accept anything else. You have no evidence whatsoever for making this dev room claim. 
---
It's things like this that I love to hear about. Everyone who loves this game tries to help a newbie out every now and again and it's nice to know it's appreciated. I hope that when you're a vet of this game like Kachenko, you'll be doing the same for another level 8 noob. 
---
LOL that's funny! We'll just call them stimulants. Vitamin B12 packs  
---
I think you nailed it.
---
 But still no where does it talk about this. But now seeing this then listening to the comments made it seems more dark
---
I get it to some extent. Serum recipes are expensive.
---
the problem is it doens't said anything how to test it: It just says Test my endurance while under effect of beer
---
you don't find the ability to PvP flag people anywhere on the map by contesting a specific location a little strange? 
---
almost like it was not intended to work like that since such a system serves no practical purpose what so ever?
---
And ONLY the robots. I personally think it's the biggest joke in the game. A lesson in what happens when we rely on data miners that only see data and not that the items are random for the robots to wear.
---
The joke is on us.
---
Hmm
---
I've never seen a huge PVP after my events (as an OCE player/server?) we all drop duplicates we don't need and some drop random plans (like T60) and the sloth's legendaries for lower players.
---
Amen
---
Willing to show my inventory on the day suspended people were able to log on. I was not even over encumbered. If I were I would not have been able to do anything but delete the items. As I recorded the entire session you have proof i didn't do this. But again not fighting Bethesdas decision but asking they give information instead of pretending they didn't fuck up 
---
Throw on percepti-bobble for a day. You'll be swimming in bobbleheads once you learn where they spawn. 
---
Posiedon has ten. The nuka cola plant has like three or four. There's a YouTube video about it. They're close though to whitesprings that I usually do all three if I need another couple hundred caps
---
if you pick up single cigarettes, you smoke them. makes the noise and everything.
---
I would like to see a scoreboard that can be viewed from the main menu, where we can see top 100 highest levels, top 100 most hours spent in-game and so on. Would also be cool if we could get some more info on our own characters. Nukes launched, events completed etc, etc.
---
Juicehead has a video were he gets old man winter 
---
Does it effect thr individual spawns of the mirv grenade? If so isnt it good with those?
---
Atom shop has decent paint for it now
---
I like the idea but it also frightens me.
---
If OP feels it‚Äôs griefing, than it‚Äôs griefing . That or bullying isn‚Äôt defined by any of us reading this. It‚Äôs defined by the recipient. OP gave recent events, not the full history. We don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs been going on for a long time &amp; just now is escalated or if it just started. 
---
Same thought maybe it will be
---
Oh yeah I think it does.
---
Also tormenter for cripple chance, maybe luck of the draw too
---
I wear the space suit, with the bottlecap sun glasses and the red ski hat.
---
I just dont get why the colliders stay in place once you pick up an item in build mode. In 4, you could just pick up a wall and walk through it. Painless.
---
Rather than exit build mode, now I usually 'replace' a wall piece with an empty doorframe, walk through it, then turn it back into a wall.
---
I have an aae pump and tse combat. I almost always favor the pump. It always feels stronger and has longer range. Even though the combat is faster, I kill enemies faster with the pump. 
---
Hey man take solace in the fact that you probably made some people very happy when they found your pieces at the vendor.
---
Yes when you drink it after its fermented the quest will change and say something like eat spoiled food to test your endurance. 
---
Yeah DENIAL. Not just some river in Egypt. 
---
Fwiw, I‚Äôm sure there are plenty of innocent people in jail who didn‚Äôt commit a murder, or steal, 
---
Regardless of what the physical evidence says.
---
You don‚Äôt have to agree with my comments but,
---
I can play the game at my leisure, and without any issues.
---
I‚Äôll leave you this last comment to ponder assuming your ego allows it, and before you or I block each other.
---
IF you‚Äôre always right, then WHY WONT Bethesda do what you ask? Lolz
---
There‚Äôs always anthem I hear they take anyone.
---
hey man you have a point but you have no evidence to accuse them that he obtained stuff from exploits.
---
After you drink the beer you will get the next step of the quest. When I got a similar quest for Rad Ant Lager. The next step for me was to eat spoiled food to test my endurance. Then I had to take the results to Biv.
---
Nice! I will try that next time, might smoke up my helmet though. LOL
---
Great stuff, sir!
---
You are entitled to your opinion and I respect your honesty. Atleast you gave actual sentences not just straight up assault 
---
Yeah the event at the mental institute proves this. You fight like 3 death bats in one event.
---
I'm at whitespring station
---
&gt;and it usually involve aliens.
---
There is 1 alien encounter
---
Building is fun but not when you get forced to do it. Moving the workbench was not a problem. I moved it even further away from the train station, where it's safe to build. I have my camp there for a while now and its hard to find a spot where it's a good point for me to fast travel and having stuff at my camp. I probably now go for a spot near the water. This spot was perfect for me. Even ground to build, vendors nearby, central in the map and even a junk pile.   
---
Maybe i just use a nukashine to get a random spot
---
You are correct and the other guy isn't. 
---
You forgot improved camp dozing.  The ability to mow down large trees and rocks that get in the way when setting up camp.
---
About where are they at? I'm assuming in the room where the event takes place?
---
Thanks for the story.  
---
That asshat doesn‚Äôt even warrant a response.  There was nothing wrong with your story, and dipshit trolls like him are why this subreddit has a bad rep.  
---
One workaround I‚Äôve tried is to paint one frame and leave the other one unpainted. When I look at the chassis in my inventory I can select which one based on the atomic shop logo next to it.
---
Well, I'm not Bethesda, but Berserkers is impacted by yout damage resistance.  So anything that increases your dr will lower a berserkers weapon damage.  Damage mitigation will not.  
---
The brahmin/fertilizer pen is technically a resource, though, not a pet.
---
Serums and other things like ultracite and power armor.
---
This is what I love about Fallout. Despite the haters for FO76 I think it's a great game with loads of potential.
---
There are so many location worth exploring just for the sake of exploring.
---
I love finding the little notes left by family's to each other, always makes me sad or when you see a pram with some toys and a dead body next to it, damn Bethesda!
---
I like to go on to https://fo76map.com and look for interesting places to visit like:
---
Wacky Willards water park, there is a fun side quest there and a few bobbleheads to find
---
Watoga has plenty of places to explore and a few side quests.
---
sometimes I just start walking and see where I end up, and if I come across another wanderer I always invite them to come with me and make a new friend. I have met some solid people this way from all over the world.

If you see me around please feel free to say Hi or visit my shop

As first time players you should:
---
--look into the dead responder near your vault
---
--look into the overseer trunk at her camp
---
For the rest good luck there ain't much we can do for you guys :) 
---
Didn't even get one today.  Somehow we lost 3 bots during the parade with about 20 high levels running around.  Then the legendary sloth glitched and didn't drop anything.  FAIL.
---
oh, so it'll be difficult to do it within short time beeing intoxicated... Thx for tips:)
---
I'm nearly at 1500 hours on PS4 and it's happened once. It was horrid but it's a super rare occurrence, I think there's usually more to these stories than the poster initially tells us. 
---
Yes.  Not every pile of junk is a resource pile.  If it is, you can walk up to it normally and see a prompt for "Collect Junk" or something like that.
---
I think it even has a distinctive appearance - there tends to be a broken blue oven on it.
---
He was on your team. That's why he didn't get a wanted status.
---
Okay, what's your gamertag?
---
This kills the crab
---
If people come together for a special event to grind for masks and never receive the masks because of a perceived bug in an already buggy game we‚Äôre going to lose more players or any returning players.   
---
If it gave rad resistance I'd wear the fuck out of it. Maybe just 100 because it's an outfit, and so it would have to give the rad resistance _on top_ of armour bonuses. Then that opens up a can of worms as to why the other outfits don't give any bonuses. Which is a good question, as the clothing did give like, +1 Special in previous games. And just one Special point wouldn't really mean that much in this game, so why not?
---
Awwwwww, that's so crazy kind of ya.
---
I would agree, except we knew about these in November or December, so there's been months of anticipation.
---
It might also glitch. So logging out and back in before attempting it fixes that glitch.
---
Yeah but wanted to make sure by perk cards such as berserker would lower its damage output. The reason why I ask is because I just use a rad suit and one fully kitted berserker perk card
---
Is the Confederate the one with the backpack/bedroll on? Those are pretty realistic for the average 76 player that carries so much junk they'd actually need a backpack. Or several.
---
The field scribe is one of my fav outfits for that very reason
---
Lol, it‚Äôs asinine but my point was that we would still know about them.
---
I think you‚Äôre on to something. I‚Äôve done the event a bunch of times and at least one robot always takes some damage. 
---
They even say ‚ÄúThis unit has taken damage‚Äù, which seems significant. 
---
lol it took me 2 days  (10 active gaming hours) to get to 50 
---
You get it from the Brahmin Pen plans. It's under resources in your camp menu since it its technically a fertilizer producer. I didn't build one for a long time because I thought I would just get a wheelbarrow (since that's what the icon looks like). Was pleasantly surprised when it also popped down my cow (now named Steakums)
---
Well, that's not true.  Bethesda teased that rare masks existed and insisted that it was possible to get them.
---
In fact, it was through data mining that players realized that the odds were a mathematically improbable random number between 0 and 1 being &gt;= 1.  That is only one result out of thousands, depending on how far out their decimals go.
---
I typed in fofojoe and then it said sent to the number one.
---

I think a dog vendor who make more sense, else everyone would be running around with the same dogmeat
---
I am 49 and recall this sound of music from when I as a kid. It was the stuff my grandparents listened to. How about some Lynyrd Skynyrd, Led Zeppelin, GnR, AC/DC, Goo Goo Dolls, Green Day. 
---
Every time i leave area on within an hour if not moments i hear open mics with what i can only assume is a small country of people constantly blathering and/or fully screaming in the background. Makes me long for the people who simply left their music or TV's loudly playing with an open mic.
---
Very aggravating when even their support forum is bugged.  The height of irony.
---
What quest is giving you trouble
---
I can see why this is the case but it does seem ironic I can use a random syringe I found in some long dead junkies caravan and drink until I blackout,. kinda makes me chuckle.
---
I built a pen for mine. Sometimes Steakums gets out, but he never goes very far so I suspect I just need to expand the fences a little more to encapsulate his entire range. He still gets killed by mobs occasionally, but it seems to mainly happen when I forget to shut the stupid gate. 
---
Yeah gonna need proof for that one
---
Yes! I need to start killing and collecting all steel and lead ! 
---
MooMoo the 7th is dead, long live MooMoo the 8th!
---
Honestly, you should go ahead and launch a nuke.  Players will show up, Fasnacht or not, because I think many of us are bored to tears of it.  I had a pretty good crowd yesterday at the SBQ, and the day before when someone else did it too.
---
They have support?? I don't think anyone works there as I'm still waiting on tickets from over a month ago!
---
oooo thank you very much!
---
How did you even get a ticket in?
---
Thank you so much!! üòÖ
---
He has a video that shows it dropping from the event?
---
You are very welcome. I hope this was helpful. It sure helps my friends and I. We grind at least a 1000 steel at once then make bullets :). Good for a weekend. 
---
Thank you!! üëèüèº
---
Thank you 
---
Yes! Been told this before by a few fellow dwellers. Thank you very much üëèüèº
---
The owl is pretty adorable.
---
The green demonic-looking one is the only rare mask I'd actually want.
---
The shape of the station in this is actually a reference to the B.O.M.B.-001 orbital platform from the cancelled *Fallout Van Buren*! Which I love.
---
But your asking people to have taken a picture the moment they received a rare mask from the event.  Even if it is 5% drop rate the odds that someone would take the picture then and care about the poll is incredibly small.  Unless you can prove they got it from the dev room then you should accept it as being received naturally.  
---
Patch 7 for me has been less stable in general, but I would agree that back during the first couple days of Fasnacht, it was especially bad.  It's leveled off a bit since then.
---
Nope, outside actually. One's close to a dumpster, the other is near a barrel near the front of the mine entrance.
---
It would in some ways. But I feel that will result in people server hopping for the rarest or best dog. Plus Dogmeat has only ever been the one species of dog. 
---
These are all very useful things to know! Thinking of starting a heavy build so going to need all the steel I can get. Happy hunting! üòä
---
The problem with you guys is you don't accept any evidence. You are just like the flat earthers. Everything presented is just "fake" or "dev room stuff" in your eyes.
---
Same to
---
You!  
---
lol you looking at trading forum? Gee never thought of that. I was looking at my duper friend's inventory. Guess that wasn't enough proof. Strange how trading forum was still flooded with duped items even after the bans. Maybe the ban didn't happen at all?
---
Dont play it or needlessly comment then.. I havent played in weeks as it's what I've been waiting for
---
Today is finally my day off from work, get laundry started, get my husband to go get the part for the Lincoln.   I thi k then hubby and I are going to try to do the parade.  I just want to try to get one mask and don't care which ugly one it is.
---
Not *this* low.  Someone has an example of every other rare thing.  Dense plans, SBQ dropping serum recipes, BoS Combat Armor, etc.
---
There is no reliable proof that *anyone* has the rare Fasnacht masks.
---
You got that dog seller in fallout 4, who sells the boxer looking dogs, and if everyone had a dogmeat then it would ruin the experience of having your own personal Best friend of the wasteland, be a cool little quest which results in the ability to buy a Best friend would be awesome.
---
I'm both a devil and angel.
---
Some people i upgrade their camp with cool beds,stove,tvs,sofa.
---
Other camps i write insults with neon or greek letters.
---
moods...
---
You mean in FO76? Mothership Zeta won't be shot down for another couple centuries, unfortunately.
---
It's hard for the robots to die if everyone is on point, but sometimes one of them will be straggling behind, and they walk right next to where the suiciders spawn.
---
No, if they can take a photo owning one of the masks showing the robots in the background for instance, it shows they are not banned and have one in the present day.
---
Timing is not necessary. It just needs proof its not pre-event.
---
I guess we're still talking about bobbleheads here? The locations are:
---
1. Take the elevator up, on the reception desk by the daily quest giver, between the two leftmost terminals.
---
2. Take the stairs up, in the back of the room immmediately to your left, on a wall shelf (most of the time there's just an oil can and some vodka there). Don't forget to pick up the 100% charged fusion core that often spawns on the table below the flat tool box (or leave it to me!).
---
3. In the (usually locked) room in the middle of that floor, where the two soldier bodies are, on top of the long console to your right.
---
yes it was like one of his first times doing the event and it dropped for him. (conspiracy?)  cant remember which video it is. I have done it over 50 times (lost count) and just get the same stuff over and over again. not even 1 rare mask. I think the chance of one of them dropping is literally 1 in a million.  
---
I‚Äôve completed it with all bots at full health. I‚Äôve also completed it with a full team all drunk with bellies full of donuts and sausages. 
---
Alcohol hydrating you at all makes literally zero sense.
---
It's a game and this is part of it.  Welcome to reality you care bear. 
---
Sadly no, we can't sell surplus plans to vendors. I've been donating them for the time being, leaving them in train station suitcases or Overseer's stashes. We may be able to sell them once player vending becomes a thing, but I don't think a list of what players will or will not be able to vendor has been made public yet (if it has, I haven't seen it.)
---
I didn't get that far into F4. My game crashed after I got pretty far into the game and corrupted my save. And it did it again when I started another one. Maybe I should play it again. 
---
I would be just as excited to see someone with a legit mask at this point.
---
"Our sausages are *the worst!"*
---
I think that it‚Äôs just combat armor with the BoS paint that you can get from doing the quest ‚ÄúForbidden Knowledge‚Äù.  
---
No idea on the exact time but I‚Äôd wager at least 5 minutes. But someone more educated can fill that in. 
---
It was a little ridiculous when we saw the mask on someone, almost felt bad for the person cause nobody would leave em alone hahaha
---
I searched for it and couldn't find anything titled about it... would think that would be an incredibly popular video at this time especially with the speculation everyone who has one is full of shit as to where they got it. Going to look a bit more i guess.
---
Man, I do this run every day.  And I got those exact locations.  I know exactly where you talking about.  And I do t recall ever seeing a bobble head at any of those locations.  So weird. 
---
I just don't have it in me to grind this event dozens and dozens of times. I mean the event was fun to do a few times when it first started but that's not how I want to spend my day.  I'm more disappointed that I won't unlock all the camp plans but I'm not willing to keep doing the events to do that. Hopefully Bethesda takes note that large group events are a good idea though, I think they could do a lot more with events that draw in most of the server. This one just isn't that interesting/rewarding after you've done it a few times.
---
Stitched SB wings on myself and flew to Japan and hoped that cat girls existed. They did.... but the other way around. I pulled an Icarus and flew close to the sun, lost my wings, and died.
---
Just through curiosity, why do you want to lvl up quickly? 
---
Is that from turning in Technical Data at Camp Venture?
---
try using the execute function as a cannibal, its wonderful.
---
Holy shit that should be a mutation. Like a jetpack mod but less AP and more special stat penalties. Someone tell Beth I found the new mutation meta
---
If the booger shows up in your inventory, yes.
---
I got the chest and legs plans but no clue where from tbh.  I do think the comment below about forbidden knowledge was for the chest but I want to say I found the legs on the 3rd floor of Defiance. 
---
Any lever action rifle or metal building set plans in stock? If so how much?
---
Not true. There are 3 plans to mod any combat armor into BOS. 1 for limbs, legs and chest. They can be found in the world, but they are random spawns.
---
I have hated murdering  those squirrels. üêø
---
The little sound they make at death.  
---
I had a üêø as a pet years ago.  Forgive me Nuttie.  üòìüò∞
---
Yes, but unfortunately the loud wind sound still plays inside if you are close to a cliff :( I wish they would use the same logic to remove that loud wind sound
---
OK, figured this out as I'm an idiot and don't do much "camping" other than place the basics.  Problem was the items were in a side scroll from another item.  I was only looking for a straight drop-down in the bed and stash categories.
---
Still can't figure out how to power my atomic lamp though.
---
The best place for murder is where you spawn in. Directly behind you. Squirrels, possums, bunnies. All just donations for the ritual
---
It's possible, but super annoying.  You have to fund small animals outside the zone.  Flatwoods has a bunch, and is a quick hop from Helvetia. 
---
Everytime, hardened mass.
---
1 actual alien encounter, the rest hinting at aliens, or alien technology. 
---
You can do the collision course event at the Morgantown airport as well although scorched have varried drops they drop shotgun ammo pretty commonly I've found
---
My strength is 41, with others being around 30-22. Cap is probably 55.
---
I'm one of the highest for hours at nearly 1500, levels were easy to boost using exploits or just by totally focusing on levelling up so don't use them as any indication of skill! 
---
I heard people saying that plans can spawn at the vendor at Grafton Station
---
Nothing because the robot is still setting up and I need to come back later :(.   Helppppp
---
Those high damage per shot/hit are usually gimmick builds. Such as bloodied, requiring you to have really low hp or something really specific like that.
---
They sacrifice survivability in exchange for more damage output.
---
I'm not really a fan of that. My high damage comes from being specced as a Vats rifleman. I have several insigating rifles.
---
While the base damage goes only to about ~240-250 when my perks activate, instigating makes the first shot hit for 400-500 damage. 
---
Being a VATS user means i also have plenty of crits, each crit at least doubles the effective damage, that 400instigating shot becoming a lot more. I rarely sneak, but if i do sneak that's another double. There's also the bonus damage for aiming at weakspots and the eagle eyes mutation... 
---
I don't know if all these doubles are only doubling the base damage without any perks active or if it's doubling my max potential damage, but what i do know is that i can literally one-shot kill any non-boss mob. 
---
Swapping 1 rifleman perk for glow sight card inside nuke zones makes it so i can one-shot ghouls without even having to use crits.
---
The advantage to my playstyle is that i never really die from PVE, and believe it or not i can clear group of mobs faster than melee builds can. Gun-FU is a huge help with that. I literally just sit and click-click-click and everything drops dead.
---
The damage displayed in my inventory tops out at 240-250, but the effective damage i can dish out is much higher. Don't chase high numbers, play the way you want to play.
---
It's not about the high numbers, it's about how you use it. ;)
---
Yep.  
---
There's rare, and there's chasing unicorns. These masks are so rare people aren't even showing off their ultra-rare drops that nobody else can get.
---
I heard that too, but since I got the drop during the quest... I no longer have to look.  Hopefully the op gives what he needs. üôÇ
---
I have the semi auto shotgun with explosive rounds (sadly not a two shot) but when I unequip demolition I lose attack stats so I know it will stack 
---
I guess I'm just a video game purist. If you didn't get there on your own, you didn't really do it. I don't let low levels fast travel to me either. 
---
What the hell, if you can find high levels who don't feel that way, I guess that's ok too.
---
No offence, but hours played doesn't reflect skill either.
---
Yea, there's a chance people praised you OP for selling it. All btw, I lived in power armor and never used real armor until a week ago. Unyielding is fantastic. I don't need damage resist when I can one shot most enemies in sneak using vats. 
---
The legs in the bonfire look like they are part of a stuffed set of clothes and shoes meant to be the body of old man winter, the way here in the U.K. we make a Guy Fawkes for Bonfire night November 5th, by stuffing a shirt trousers and shoes with straw to go with the head and toss the whole thing on the bonfire. 
---
Evidence isn't just taking a picture. I would probably be a flat earther if the only evidence we had of the earth being round was 3 pictures.
---
Every picture we've seen has been of a different person to the person taking the picture. We don't have a single image/video of the masks dropping from the event.
---
OIC you're just like that in general. NM
---
I was sooo hoping for a Hannibal the cannibal reference here üòÅ
---
I posted about this before, nothing yet.
---
Level 99 and almost all of the legendary weapons and armour i get are just rubbish. 
---
I did finally get my TSE handmade a couple of weeks ago, I bought it off a very kind chap in here lol.
---
Any response from B?
---
I'm new to cannibalism. 
---
DLC Bethesda?
---
Thanks for the reply, I guess that will make the perk even stronger.
---
Im going to miss destroying player camps.
---
Gotta get dat bounty!
---
Absurdly shiny? In your dreams. I still see the rust eating away at that metal, but I guess its shinier compared to other armors.
---
In Far Harbor, there was also the super mutant where you could buy a regular dog, a wolf, or a mutant hound.
---
Ok i watched his fasnacht videos... old man winter effigy is not the mask.... there is no mention of nor does one drop, he got an owl mask and a toothy man mask. Back to being positive everyone who posts one is full of shit. Zero confirmed xbox drops... 
---
LOL waiting on a ticket for almost 2 months they don't care 
---
Like a scare crow? I guess. Maybe that makes it seems less dark. 
---
Though some of the comments you can over here from the bots one said about how long it takes for him to die.
---
So here is a real good place.
---
Travel to treetops. Once spawned ,reach the highway to your left and the railway tunnel.
---
Under the tunnel is a random event spawn,i found 3 deathclaws there ,every time mine died.
---
This place is probably the best as you don't have to run for miles like near abbie bunker.
---
&gt;Molerats  because they can teleport at will
---
Just like us then.
---
This info will aid the Brotherhood well...
---
Same here. Came looking for an answer, finding this is disheartening.
---
Yeah. I definitely didn't play Far Harbour but I did get it so my friend could play it. 
---
Ive been smashing those camps
---
Hmm . . . I hadn't thought of it like that. Thanks for presenting another perspective. You should copy that comment to the video. He'd appreciate the honest feedback. 
---
Also, thanks for stating your claim without being a rude punk ass chump, as seems to be the norm for some.
---
If anything they show a resilience to burn out.
---
You can't even vape in this game smh
---
No?
---
Most of them are referencing old movies. Indiana Jones, Monty Python, Star Wars...
---
Why? So you can tell me that they got it from the dev room? 
---
I did, I took all his screws and then chased him down until he left the server, nobody fucks with my MooMoo
---
None of those examples are griefing. Grow a pair.
---
Vault 76 was filled with the best and brightest. You only take chems/pills that give enough of a positive effect to risk the bad.
---
Unfortunately, cigs do not carry this same idea.
---
They gunna kill you quick.
---
Yep just like a scarecrow but it would def be more dark and interesting if a vault dweller had ended up in there lol
---
Nice thanks!
---
easily in the triple digits at this point, spent the entire day doing the event yesterday and i've yet to see someone else wear one of the 'rare' masks, it's either bugged or we've been zucced 
---
Oh he's done it now! Look whats happened!
---
Perk cards for swapping out builds.probably. I'm bored of guns and want to try melee but average 1 level a day ;|
---
It's ok man. Going forward know you aren't alone. You can make a business in buying those items from vendors and trading them for more. People sell a lot of stuff to vendors that is worth thousands of caps on the market. Always keep a look out for 3* stuff.
---
Ad victoriam to that!
---
none taken, and i wasn't suggesting that either :) There were players at 600 months ago from using the various tricks at the start.
---
When you talk your wife into playing and she quits a week later. Now i have 2.
---
Turns out I had to eat spoiled food - got one in inventory, so went smooth :)
---
Follow up question. How and can you, log on both at the same time with 1 pc? (If I wanted a nuke for stash space etc)
---
Every social multiplayer game is gonna have extremely rare cosmetics that 99% of the playerbase will never have. Division 2 sill have them too.
---
Yes, these masks ARE ridiculous and I agree they should have a higher drop rate (if they even drop), but 50 tries is nothing compared to grinds for cosmetics in most games.
---
Sometimes it doesnt work. A group of friends and I pvped a couple dudes (one who was cosplaying as Preston Garvy) and in the end they gave up and we had an enjoyable chat with them. Except it wasn't as enjoyable because Preston was there. Minuteman just dont have a way with words.
---
Hey good job, bud! 
---
I'm not lying. But I sure don't owe you salty assholes proof.  
---
Well fallout logic points that direction. And someone mentioned wickerman
---
Just buy them from people. 500caps and you have both again.
---
You can have Spotify access folders on your pc
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the name Brahmin is based on a Hindu cow god so you‚Äôre fine 
---
People downvoting please justify your downvote
---
Or that I've enjoyed the game! It's getting a bit thin now though. The new "content" is pretty poor from a gameplay point of view. I'd like some quests and good stories, not a brewing station and a buggy event with a level 30 boss!
---
Have you submitted tickets again? That just pushes your old one to the bottom and you gotta wait again.
---
Also, buying the more expensive version of the game =/= being entitled to better service.
---
Where do you get the pin plans
---
This is exactly why I'm not providing screenshots or proof. Thanks for pricing my point, pumpkin üòò
---
My Gt is Staticchmbr1 when did you want to try to meet up? I walk between Morgan town and whitespring station to do dailies and legendary farming
---
I don‚Äôt have a mic unfortunately. Iv tried to trade with people several times and like an idiot can‚Äôt figure it out and they get frustrated and leave before Iv had time to figure it out. 
---
Or even better, a in game chat system like every other multiplayer out there
---
They simply don't drop. Zero confirmed on xbox, like 3 - 5 on ps4. No video or screenshots of it being awarded. I don't care what they claim, they didn't get it from the event just like the carry weight backpacks that i see in peoples inventory.  It's really shitty for Bethesda to keep giving false hope to cover their ass. I figured they would change the drop rate quietly at some point but i guess they are riding this one out. 
---
No new ticket. But I'm sorry for an AAA company over 1 month is unacceptable 
---
Yes, the plan is called a Brahmin pen, and in the workshop it‚Äôs

If you are in PA, throw some reactive plates on it. Reflects 50% of melee damage back onto the attacker. Bloodied Melee builds are no longer a threat. 
---
No power armor is OP in PvP
---
Its all extremely under powered
---
My friend was not in the team. Killed the cow. No bounty.
---
 But where do I get it...wait 
---
There is no need to fix it. It works just fine if you learn to use it properly. I have spent some time perfecting my use of the Daisycutter with the MIRV. It takes some getting used to but now I use it to clear rooms and it is very effective. Makes running through the nuke silos a breeze. Here are some tips:
---
Don't aim up or down, just keep it level. 
---
Pull the trigger and then back up immediately. (Especially if you are using the perk card that increases explosive blast radius)
---
But then she can‚Äôt get a sun tan and she can‚Äôt talk to the squirrels and possums
---
&gt; Those high damage per shot/hit are usually gimmick builds. Such as bloodied, requiring you to have really low hp or something really specific like that.
---
Correct. Adding to that, perks like Bloody Mess, Nerd Rage, Adrenaline Reaction and such have to be active, Bobblehead and Magazine bonuses added, and you have to catch that right moment to screencap your weapon stats as long as it all adds up.
---
Don't fall for it, what you're seeing is not everyday base damage output. Those caps are usually done to max out the asking price for a gun or hammer.
---
It depends what the ticket was for.
---
Wurst*
---
Woah good to know. I'd better pick those things up!
---
Thanks. Now that's how you adult, kids.
---
Not at all. The ticket hasn't even been read or assigned to anyone. "Waiting for agent"
---
I have to hit the hay at the moment, but in about 19 hours give or take, I should be back on. And I am pretty close to that station.
---
Level?
---
How does one check hours played?
---
Im on XB1 if that matters
---
I don‚Äôt farm caps.  Huge waste of time.  I see so many people unhappy with the game because they try to acquire and hoard caps as a primary function and complain about it endlessly.  The game does not demand it.
---
I posted this 21 days ago
---
I remember we had to use beer hat, mining helmet,mask or a "hat" for challenges.
---
They weight nothing anyway.
---
People are over thinking this. Some masks just have a low probability of dropping
---
The skull mask is just an ordinary mask you can pick up in the world (I believe I picked one up from one of the watch towers)
---
User name is CaptWolf55

Thanks. FALCO29

I do not know who you are, but I will find you... and I will kill you
---
I respect the dedication. Also praise mothman.
---
ya'll just jealous we have cooler uniforms...
---
Supposedly combat armor mods are found in the toxic valley. I've found deep pocketed and ultralight there but haven't found BoS yet.
---
Tenderizer is a must. I always notice the difference with my 2 shot gaitling gun. Also adrenaline in agility is a must. 
---
In luck you want the perk that give you a chance to stagger or break limbs. I thhink its called ‚Äúone gun army‚Äù. You also want bloody mess. 
---
My 2 shot gaitling gun does 197 base damage (since the last update). The thing is a beast and can be easily ised with or without power armor. 
---
If you got banned for cheating/exploits, then they probably pushed you to the bottom of the queue, since they have little interest in unbanning likely... however, they also probably have 100x more unbanning tickets then anything at this point. I created a support ticket last week about the game not loading (xbox), and I heard back the next day with troubleshooting fixes
---
Doing a similar career path.

Stealth sniper with heavy perception, agility and and intel.

Omg so much freakin fun. 
---
Just wished I have chameleon armor. 
---
When I‚Äôm 100, gonna shave some intel and put more points into strength and endurance.
---
Alao make it so that you only lose up to 50 caps when dying and not however much your level is, since people over level 50 get shafted with PvP this way
---
It's one of the rare times scrapper is a good perk in this fallout. 
---
That X01 Quantum looks nice
---
You‚Äôre actually right, but what I‚Äôm saying that all alien stuff in New Vegas comes from Wild Wasteland, which is not that much (1 ufo and 1 alien blaster?). I was mixing it with some of fo3.
---
Don‚Äôt worry - when the event is over.
---
‚ÄúMissed out on a rare mask? No problem! You can find them for a ridiculously short period of time in the Atomic shop for the low price of 1000 atoms‚Äù
---
I have a huge house in a pretty high traffic area, after having my CAMP destroyed once by a bored player I have taken a lot of extra precautions, maybe these will help you too
---
-Never AFK in game for longer than 2 minutes, not worth the risk, just log out to main menu and take care of your IRL stuff first
---
-ALWAYS Check your map randomly to see if anyone is near your CAMP or if the "YOUR CAMP IS UNDER ATTACK" alert is going off, it only shows like 50% of the time in game on your HUD but will always show on the map
---
-immediately log off if you're somewhere far and there is someone at your CAMP, doesn't matter their level, I've seen level 20s destroy an entire CAMP within minutes
---
-NEVER EVER EVER Accept random friend and group requests, I get these all the time from random high levels, what they can do is once you accept their friend/group request, they can join your game and port to your camp and destroy it, like the other post said, people do this for high bounties and this is a very good way to trick people
---
Fallout 76 is an amazing game with amazing people, sadly the lack of endgame content has turned a good amount of people to grief and troll simply because they're bored out of their minds, I'm not paranoid and unfriendly to everyone I meet, I don't think right off the bat "This mofo wants to wreck my camp!" but when I see a high level inching towards my camp, I can't help but be a bit worried...
---
Deep pocketed combat armor showed up for me at the penitentiary and Grafton steel, not sure which one was which but I think Grafton steel is the spot for deep pocketed limbs.
---
NO I AM NOT!!!!!
---
Tbh the officers uniform does ressemble that of the gustapo yes?
---
I want an explosive 50 cal....been hoping and praying. Lmk if shell trade. Thanks
---
I mean... that was also work!!
---
They‚Äôve been occurring at various spots around the map since day one. 
---
Logging into the game at your base, it's under attack and you whip out your gun, only to fire blanks. You look down and Ammo reads 0. You have to reload just for it to read your ammo.  
---
Meanwhile your base is getting attacked and your turrets are asleep... again... 
---
Just a small correction - Blocker simply reduces melee damage you take regardless of what type of weapon you have equipped yourself. It's purely a defensive card.
---
It‚Äôs a random plan drop, I got mine at level 1 back in the beta after finding an overseers cache
---
I must find one must get a moomooo and name him daddy
---
Keep doing those BOS events. Line in the sand. Distant thunder. Ect... and turning in tech data.
---
if you're desperate you go to the market. Some people sell extra plans. I broke down and bought the chest mod. Paid 1750 for it. 
---
use ideas from the military? be more 'realistic'? Here's a mop and broom, go sweep water while it rains. 
---
Gas mask, start taking health damage as it gets used up. 
---
Stay and wait at your camp for inspection. Make those beds. They're unsat. 
---
Recruitment blues at the DMV was a legitimate realistic experience. I don't need more of those.
---
i feel like anyone over 250 used glitches to get there honestly.
---
Kids are far more likely to be offered actual cigarettes than pretend drugs.  Hopefully you can understand that, underage smoking is a serious and common problem.

I‚Äôm on PS4 and can craft it

Still unacceptable for them to ignore it as a company
---
i wish you could open the door outward.. it kinda blocks my stair going up into my house.
---
Go to "Challenges" and under "Character (I think?)" is "Explore for XXXX Hours" and that's your time played.
---
Ive been smuggling out technical data since day one...
---
Do you know how many masks were taken from a dev room?  Why would a banned player want to display the item they were banned for?   It seems to me that it is unlikely you would actually receive proof from those players and have possibly accused people of doing something that they could be banned for.  How many people are going to step forward and risk it?  How many people, who received a rare mask, will care about your poll especially if they might be accused of a bannable offense?  Aren‚Äôt many FO76 players cautious by nature?  Have you gone thru every video from live-streams of the event.  Just saw Juicehead play the event as a level 1-2 where he comments on someone in the event wearing one.  My point is not that I am concerned about whether people got these or not but that you place weight in the poll.  You would have been more accurate if you asked people what masks they have received no proof required. 
---
TL;DR. Welcome to the community new Vault-dweller. You will find most fallout players are very nice and we really like to help eachother.
---
Just be careful when you're claiming a workshop and a high level player approaches. This is where you can encounter the assholes.
---
If you're in a workshop and you see someone approaching, offer them a team invite. If they accept you can share resources and xp with them. If they decline, be prepared, they might be planning to take over.
---
The sloth is only level 30 isn‚Äôt it? I read it people said it‚Äôs for low level players only so I haven‚Äôt even planned to do the parade. 
---
It may be hard to meet up with the time difference. It's 10am eastern here, and I'll be on a bit today.. then work, and won't be on again until about 4pm eastern tomorrow
---
Word. Well good luck friend. I hope performance improves and smoothes out for you!
---
Hi, raider here. You mean thiiiiiis military circuit board in my hand that ya'll so graciously shared with? Well I tossed on the ground where I found it... your clubhouse is lame... RAIDERZ RULES!
---
It may appear over thinking but avid gamers know developers hide stuff. From turning cranks throughout a game or button combos unlock things you couldnt get to before.
---
So how far fatched is it that these Developers didnt do that here. Its a celebration so maybe the more people who attend will impact it. Or maybe standing in the formation of the missing bots at the start would trigger it.
---
Plus with that notion, it makes replay better.
---
And what do you do with it? :)
---
Or we could just leave it as is.
---
I like the CBRN idea, but a bandana, space suit, or gas mask makes you almost immune to disease. So maybe it could be a new legendary effect, gives blight to PvP target with poison dmg? The tourniquet and bandages are already outclassed by stimpaks, or eating and drinking to restore health. I do think there's a place for a one handed weapon to move an injured teammates, or a crippled one, cause broken legs make you an easy target. I'm pretty sure military tactics can be done in the game already, albeit not as professionally as irl. Also is dual wielding a thing irl, because itd really be cool if it was. And may be a good idea for pistols in 76
---
Also look at bear arms, stabilised, bloody mess, heavy guns has a couple of perk cards and bandolier is useful. Can‚Äôt remember the names but there is also one the duration of power cores and one that reduces sprint cost that are worth looking into. 
---
A vampire heavy weapon will make you an absolute tank of used with this build, admittedly you‚Äôll miss out on the FPS of a TSE but you‚Äôre be almost unstoppable lol.
---
This is just from my lvl 99 pa/heavy build, many people have other builds they prefer, so a little trial and error may be required.
---
I was doing a run it night. We were defending the parade from super mutants when a vertibird crashed on the parade killing all the robots. Dont let a vertibird crash on your parade. You cant finish lol.
---
Maybe it would be a way to add human NPCs, some people built their own space station before the bombs, and went there during the bombs. However, with most people in this game that aren‚Äôt high-level, they run out of materials pretty quick. They can‚Äôt repair any damage, or refuel, so they have to make a beeline for Earth. Space Stations aren‚Äôt really meant for flying, so they crash.
---
This is where the players come in. We hear banging from a closed room in the spaceship, and pry it open using power armour. 3 humans crawl out of it, and we have new NPCs. 
---
That's exactly my point, sbq wasn't an end game. Not much to do as a "group" just makes the game easier. Once we get some actual patches rolling in and a reason to have the gear we've been farming game will be immensely better.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, when the event is over.
---
‚ÄúMissed out on a rare mask? No problem! Available now in the atomic shop for a ridiculously short period of time for the low price of 1000 atoms‚Äù
---
I think mentats are like the equivalent in the fallout universe.
---
1) It gives you more space in that it lightens any parts or frames you're wearing or carrying, eg: a spare frame would weigh 7.5 instead of 10. I don't find this particularly useful since I typically grab the frame if I'm picking up spare PA parts. The frame only weighs 10, and can carry up to six parts that would otherwise weigh A LOT more, all for the low low price of just 10.
---
I suppose this could be useful if you're carrying around a lot of spare PA parts without a frame to put them on, but why put yourself through that?
---
2) I think it's from the first hit, ie: you hit something and its damage output is reduced for X seconds. I don't know how often the effect refreshes, but unless you're under level 50 and/or fighting something really tough, I suspect you'll kill whatever it is before the effect wears off. Again, I don't find this particularly useful but full disclosure, I have a Vampire's .50-cal that has totally negated my need for stimpacks or other healing. The gun fires so fast and each hit gives health regen, so damage mitigating perks are a waste because nothing can kill me anyway (aside from other players, but I avoid PvP.)
---
3) To the best of my knowledge no, Rifleman/Commando only work for weapons like the Hunting, Combat, and Assault rifles. Heavy Gunner is what you want for the minigun, gatling gun, MG-42, .50-cal, etc.
---
4) The way I understand it, yes, Demo Expert does buff explosive legendary weapon damage. At least it used to a couple months ago, I'm not sure if this is still the case.
---
The drop rates should be super low for items that are year round.
---
 This is a yearly event that lasts one week. 
---
 The odds of getting at least one rare mask for the week should be a lot greater than they are.
---
Ive never even been close to max caps as im sure a huge majority of the playerbase hasnt either, remember that the people on reddit tend to be the more hardcore gamers so a higher % of people on here will agree with you but that doesnt match the actual majority of players
---
I really hope they don't add this. Or if they do, we should be able to disable it in the game options menu. I really don't want to be annoyed with randoms BSing. 
---
Yeah, I used to farm that event. Fun. Not very rewarding on the gear side, though.
---
It doesn't show up in your damage numbers when you equip / unequip the perk?
---
It sounds more like your putting it out and taking it than smoking it.
---
I believe that is or was (as in time limited) an Atomic Shop item.
---
The M in the C.A.M.P. literally stands for mobile... and im not sure what a tourniquet would do without diseases infecting specific limbs or being able to lose them in combat. I'm all for adding realism but most of these ideas would require implementing entirely new concepts to the game like the carry thing. They were barely able to make new workbenches and when they did it locked people out of their characters with the fermenting bug. Would be cool though!
---
Do you though?
---
Good point I‚Äôll check that in a sec 
---
Still got the shop up and running?
---
What kind of glitches are you referring too? I‚Äôm at level 330 on PS4 the only glitches I‚Äôve been enjoying is the blue screens during nuke events especially at WS. 
---
Here is how you fix it:
---
Buy new copy of the game. 
---
Don't cheat.
---
It‚Äôs just unpainted steel. 
---
I didn't read through all the comments but the robot that takes your extra steins even makes a comment about it being "more than what he wanted" (something along those lines) so it might not be a bug.
---
And another at the Armory. 
---
Honestly the plot fuckin sucks and the choices made by many of the characters are overly selfish, especially during the parts where they find Mount Weather. The characters are just unlikeable and selfish. 
---
alright my bad. I know i seen someone get it on video. will have to check my YouTube watch history, all fallout youtubers do the same thing so might have messed up who it was.
---
If this was the true objective wouldn't it have made much more sense to just leave them out of the game all together?  There's few places in Appalachian territory where you don't stumble upon them.  
---
About to get off. Hit me up when you catch me online. I'll hook you up
---
I play with 2 guys who are at about 1300 hours
---
I take a load of excess good to vendors. Doesn't usually take very long for me to get all 200 caps they have in the til. Produce, excess chems, etc.
---
The automated system looks through the meta data, you very stable genius. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I will admit it is a very complex trade system with a poorly done tutorial. Hit me up on PS4 sometime and I'll do my best to walk you through it :-) usually on late nights. I'm Est and on after 9 when I am
---
Nuka Quantum paint is pretty great and free.
---
If I was defending him I wouldn‚Äôt be asking you for info. Did bethesda post a response to this guy or something?
---
I'm sure they were. Lol
---
I hope they fix it.  I was just starting to get back into the game, and leaving a quest like this bugs me.
---
Okay. Power armored ghouls. Why doesn‚Äôt this exist? There was a mod for FO4 that added them, though I don‚Äôt remember the mod name, but they were cool as fuck. And with what Bethesda could do for a really fucked up, rusted and uncared for suit of power armor with a rotting ghoul trapped inside, the design possibilities are endless. There‚Äôs so much potential for an enemy in that concept.
---
Would you craft one for me?
---
I believe is called "One More Pils" by Andy Vale. This isn't the one from Fallout 76, but is the song: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2KUPiVmajs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2KUPiVmajs)
---
I used a war drum till it explode 
---
I bet. I'm finding out the same. I still use power armor for silo runs and sbq but I've been going exploring without it more often. Having the right build makes a huge difference too. 
---
Click on your name in this post and change your flair :)
---
You clearly have missed the point.
---
The people who raided the dev rooms and received unreleased content got banned. Those items are gone.
---
However what still exists are the photos they took with the items. Like Obamas photo holding a rifle, you can't remove a photo.
---
And yes, its possible to take a photo without identifying yourself.
---
You also keep making out that I'm responsible for the poll. I urge you to cross-reference my username to that of the OP.
---
Lastly, I'm not even talking about the stats from the poll, I was fully aware before talking to your stupid ass that the poll can only provide guidelines of a small sample. Everything I discuss, is related to my own experiences. I myself have played the event between 60 - 80 times since day one (and mask or no mask I'm making a lot of caps off this), and have never received nor seen anyone with a rare mask in game, as well as not coming across any supporting evidence online that any have dropped at all.
---
So if you would kindly let the adults continue their discussion, while you find a topic more suited to your understanding to be involved in.
---
Sounds really cool and op! Although I prefer running into groups of enemies and making as much noise as I can with my heavy weapons.
---
Okay, well I have a set of those plans for you if we can sort something out over the next week. I'm on Pacific time, so its 7:30am, but I work graveyards, so this is bedtime for me. 
---
Definitely. Been finding a lot of weapons that way too. 
---
Thank you üòÅ
---
I wear it with the assualtron helmet. It makes me feel more spacey since the helmet opens/closes when you equip/put away your weapon. 
---
I‚Äôve never heard 400%.  I‚Äôve heard 30% and 50% multiple times.
---
I just read on the wiki that it can possibly only be crafted at the tinker bench marked by the quest but I don't have one marked by the quest, so I'm turning over the amusement park looking for tinker benches. I'll update if one works.
---
I completely agree. So many times I‚Äôm approached for a trade out in the wild and the player gets upset because my current weapon that I‚Äôm using isn‚Äôt for sale. A way to mark certain items as NFS, even if it‚Äôs an attachment after they gage requested it would be awesome. 
---
Interesting, I didn't know that was a rare plan. I'm on ps4 and signed on for the first time in a couple months yesterday and I had the plan for the marine armor helmet.
---
If your email explanation is similar to ‚Äò900 hours guy‚Äô it says in there that the ban is final and non reviewable until they fix the issues leading up to them. 900 was complaining about no response a day or two ago but they basically state in the initial communication ‚Äòwe are done talking to you about this‚Äô
---
Most games allow you to hide the chat box
---
How about alcohol? Having daily/weekly challenges to pound 50+ beers/mixed drinks certainly feels like it‚Äôs encouraging a bad habit. 
---
While in build mode doors should just be ghosts.
---
I feel as if there already is by taking the piece on and off. It's probably not really necessary for farming runs anyway. Maybe I'm being petty.
---
Do you have high END?
---
I‚Äôm constantly getting legendary dysentery or legendary rad worms.
---
Most, if not all, would‚Äôve crashed to earth due to atmospheric drag. It doesn‚Äôt make much physical sense why there‚Äôs still orbital weapon satellites in orbit by the time of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, where you actively make use of those satellites is weird 
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault\_63](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Vault_63)
---
Thanks for your helpful comment, I think I've decided what to do!
---
not until it opens. until then it is speculation and guess work.
---
Just rebooted MODUS, so he'll be fine for now. 
---
I find turrets to be remarkable unreliable.
---
I'll have to try this. Everytime I use i die.
---
There's a bunch of perks that increase general damage all through out the SPECIAL stats.
---
Those guys have a BIG DAMAGE SCREENSHOT build, centered on having all those perks. They chug chems and booze and other consumables and do whatever they need to do in order to trigger the damage boosts. Then they make their videos and take their screenshots.
---
If you have an explosive version of a gun that matches your build you wont see that kind of damage. But here's a few perks to look into.
---
Adrenalin, bloody mess, demolitions expert. 
---
Happy to help! I've been running a power armor/heavy gun build for quite a while, feel free to hit me up with any more questions.
---
Trap xp glitches. You could literally set a macro that would auto click for you and just leave your game running. It'd get like 250xp a second constantly.
---
Oh, I'm so sorry, I'll try to be more compassionate towards cheaters and exploiters, because after all, they more than anyone need our support and understanding, because it's not their fault, it's Bethesda's or society's or the community's or some bullshit. 
---
Again. I hope you and the rest of your fellow cheaters, who ruin things for other people miss as much content as possible. 
---
Thanks for your reply! This is my plan atm, do you have any thing to add? I don't really know which perks are very handy for this build in Perception, Endurance or Charisma. It's very messy btw
---

---
Same. It's a lot of fun being bloodied/adrenal with unyielding armor. 
---
You were banned for duping and exploiting probably, and nobody here cares that your ticket doesn't have any priority at Bethesda.
---
They used to but haven't since Patch 6
---
what about weed man. everyone deserves to get high in the apocalypse!
---
I had a wanted level because I picked the lock on a government drop. Seriously. 
---
So I asked my friend to come kill me to drop the bounty. Some random level 91 started shooting at me while I was waiting. Not sure what kind of gun he was using but it was weak. I power attack killed him with a Grognak. He respawned seeking revenge and I did it again. And again. I killed him ELEVEN times before he disappeared. 
---
Eventually my friend showed up and claimed my bounty. 
---
I‚Äôm not an asshole and don‚Äôt do pvp so this is the most meanest story I‚Äôve got. :-P
---
 I spoke to /u/Ladydevann recently and she said an update was coming soon. Shortly after that people could log in again and were suspended again a few days later. What I ask for now is why we were let back in and re suspended 
---
Assholes..assholes never change.
---
When I see highbies near me, I block their GT FIRST, Then I‚Äôll server hop.
---
I see it as proactively managing risk. 
---
If they cant see me, I can‚Äôt be griefed, or griefed long.
---
If I‚Äôm gonna do anything risky, same deal. No one wants to be robbed after respawning.
---
I just wanted to know if you had any thing to add? I don't really know which perks are very handy for this build in Perception, Endurance or Charisma. (It's very messy btw)
---
Do Biv's daily.
---
The best way to do it is get the super duper perk (allows you to craft double) and continually craft a light combat armor arm piece, then scrap said pieces. You will eventually learn all modifications to combat armor. That‚Äôs what I did. And now I can craft combat armor helmets, paint jobs, and any mods
---
If you want to go the tactical way and not be noticed by other players, it could be an option. The C.A.M.P. is more of a place to fast travel to from far away and to make it more of a stationary place setting.
---
The tent is faster and makes it less of a hassle to use instead of having to build a little shack.
---
The tent would be 5 wt, the sleeping bag would be 3 wt, and the other components to craft will be tools. This makes it easier for the player.
---
The tourniquet is a work in progress but I'm guessing it would give a challenge where you might bleed out in the game. Dealing with some players in a team they could save their life and get them to a safe location to fix them up instead of dying and having to respawn.
---
Except the ticket is about neither of those things. checking my post history makes you an expert now does It?
---
It's pretty viable, but there are better builds. It's a really fun build tho
---
I was there and didnt think to look for a code. Was more preoccupied with my server about to have a nuke go off so I was looking around but then positioning myself to try and see the blast since I hadn't seen it at that point. 
---
Damnit! Thanks, just wanted to make sure before I started using it. It‚Äôs kind of hard to judge because so many weapons fall into multiple perk categories 
---
Ughhhh. 
---
Ok. So Bethesda released a game.
---
They then released a new game mode.
---
It's new content. 
---
You have to download it. 
---
It's by definition, DLC. 
---
Whether the game was what you wanted it to be at launch or not. Its not a roll back, as roll backs replace things with previous iterations of things. This is supplementary. 
---
I'll add you later! Interested in bos paint for my PA:)
---
You need recipes only obtainable from the Biv daily quests. 
---
Once you‚Äôve read them they appear in the Still crafting object in your camp. It will list the ingredients required. 
---
If it produces a drink with a fermentable prefix, it needs to mature in either your inventory or in the fermentor crafting object in your camp. 
---
Thank you and to all who contributed. I got absolutely dicked yesterday and I'm never trying that again as my character is non-PVP oriented. 
---
It isnt DLC in and of itself it is part if the larger Wild Appalachia DLC that has been trickling out since march 12th.
---
Mfw our ‚Äúclubhouse‚Äù is a highly advanced military bunker with a highly advanced Artificial Intelligence that can be connected to facilitates across the United States and orbital space platforms, and is capable of power armor production and weapon production while your clubhouse is a ski lodge constantly overrun with scorched and operated by a drugged up glorified Mister Handy.
---
No problem! Just let me know when you on. I plan on being around a bit later. 
---
Unfortunately it's sad how true this is. They make the rng so low it's impossible and don't give any communication so people grind like crazy with no idea.
---
Brotherhood are the Nazis. We‚Äôre AMERICANS TRAITOR.
---
possibly because they might suspect you're a cheater.. or are ticketing to get unbanned ? .. common sense.. and you've not exactly said anything against those possiblities either
---
Yeah i suppose it would make sense as an alternative to using a stimpack on a dying character.
---
I have some dirty army fatigues i upgraded with a treated lining, they give +1 Chr and Int and some slight defense bonuses? 
---
So ya for that reason never changing my under armour. Thank fuck for the duster covering it all!  
---
You just don't get it do you. Some people love rare cosmetic items.  Just because you don't care and don't want rare masks doesn't mean other people don't want and care about it.  But you are just one of those people that only care about your own thoughts and opinions.
---
 Having items in the world year round being super rare is fine by me it as it should be.
---
 This is a yearly event that happens for one week and 1 week only.  Doing an event 40-50 even a 100 times and not coming out with at least one rare mask is absolutely ridiculous. 
---
I'm level 21 so it's not me at least
---
Well, if you're down to run the event 10,000 times, you might score a rare mask!
---
That's right, you can pop a fast travel mat down in a workshop so you don't end up a long way off. That's in the Misc Structures build options and takes very little resources. 
---
Would be very useful in the C.A.M.P, although yesterday I landed actually inside the building for first time. 
---
God I love these posts.
---
"I cheated, and likely violated the ToS related to this online service and was banned. Now they won't respond to me as fast as I'd like, probably because they are dealing with players who weren't cheating little pricks, who have actual issues to be resolved"
---
They aren't responding as fast as you feel acceptable? You used their product in a way that was unacceptable. Seems fair to me.
---
See rule 9 buddy
---
Perhaps there could a central market location that players can set up a shop at, it could have free fast travel or something and be set up in an old flea market. It would have enough stalls that everyone can set one up in a game. 
---
Only times I've wrecked someone's C.A.M.P.:
---
- When they put it next to the golf course
---
- When they put it on my resource node and I have to server hop to find another place to live
---
And one time because a dude had a floating platform camp and like seven water purifiers that were all locked. What a dick. 
---
Mtnfriend and instated new characters just to try something new. When we were about level 9 some guy that's level 50 rolls uo in his T60 armor and starts destroying my camp. Well my friend leaves and comes back on his level 85 character with maxed out sneak bonuses, and one shots the level 50 through his power armor somehow. 
---
Suffice it to say that the level 50 went along on his own business after that.
---
\+1. Even Elder Scrolls Online MMORPG doesn't have global auction house, and I like it.
---
That's what gives it our charm. I go to your guy's place and it's like visiting the dmv... BOOOOOORING. That's it, I'm coming down there and I'm painting mustaches on all of Modus' monitors.
---
Mutation not the armor
---
Judging by the responses here, and the amount of people I've seen above 200 myself. I would expect they may have their own level of competition.
---
My first nuke I hit Flatwoods. 
---
no ragrats
---
When I came across the dog vendor in my Fallout 4 playthrough he was being attacked by a Deathclaw.
---
He did not win. RIP, vendor.
---
I wouldnt be surprised if there is some kind of cap limit increase when player vending drops in april, but so far is hasnt been any talk about it like how they mentioned stash increases.
---
yup, this
---
True I feel that survival mode could give it more of a challenge with some of these ideas. Granted some of it does sound silly. But some silly ideas did make it into some of these games.
---
Legendary effect sounds good.
---
Yes but if you run out of stimpacks and have lots of cloth, you could heal yourself. Another thing is you need food and water. You going to eat up all of your resources to heal or use some cloth to patch yourself up.
---
Dual wielding is an idea I would love to see implemented too. It would help out for those weapons that are under powered and can make it easier to fire and reload your weapons while you fire one weapon.
---
How can someome even stand to play one gake for so long? I love this game to death but my highest character is only level 70 something.
---
Ahh my bad for quick reading. Have an upvote as an apology.
---
I would recommend heading into the zone and grab all the nuked flowers you can. Also you can farm the low level mobs for the "mass" needed to craft.
---
Damn it! That is definitely classified! &lt;facepalm&gt;
---
Then say what the ticket is for so people can formulate an informed opinion‚Äîwhich is what you asked for in the first place. 
---
Well, welcome to Fo76. I'm sure our beautiful community has said hello!
---
If you want to level up faster I can recommend hanging around higher level players. They often enjoy the company and helping out, and shooting their enemies will grant you crazy xp :)
---
In addition to the previous messages, this new mode also addresses direct concerns people have with the game. PvP players want more pvp, non pvp players want less. This helps both parties.
---
You don't get any more perks after 50, so they are as strong as any 50, the only difference is gear and it doesn't have to vary much.
---
I‚Äôm level 101 with about 530hrs in, I spend my caps on building plans all the time and have never had over 9k caps at one time. What‚Äôs your secret to getting so many caps? 
---
And the guild vendor system encourages you to go out of your way make effort and find the best deal. If i'm needing something specific i'll do a rotation around all the vendor hubs until i find it at the lowest price for highest quality. It's a time sink but one i don't mind at all
---
I skipped doing the quest line altogether until I accidentally jump started in when I wandered into some random bunker. 
---
Now I am simply biding my time until I can destroy MODUS. Hopefully by peeing into his circuitry. For America. 
---
Perhaps this is a minority issue. I don‚Äôt consider myself a hardcore ‚Äúplayer vendor‚Äù or anything. I Farm Legendaries and sell them. And occasional scrap bulk. 
---
But every day I hit cap limit and one time it cost me a decent chunk of change. And a few times it stopped my ability to sell because I didn‚Äôt have anything I wanted to buy. 
---
I know it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgood problem to have‚Äù but I know for certain I‚Äôm not alone. 
---
Hey no you can‚Äôt do that that‚Äôs not allowed
---
gosh, i can't wait for some better high level stuff! Even a max level Uranium Fever would've kept me going for a while if i'm honest!
---
It's really not though, because the person claiming the workshop to initiate PvP doesn't even have to fully claim it. Just the attempt triggers PvP so after the original owner dies and respawns they attempt to claim it again marking the original owner for PvP. It's a abusive system it's not PvP it's grefing at that point.
---
Some changes need to be made, lock the PvP area to the area of the workshop, put a delay in at how often it can be contested once a contestion has failed, and the biggest change need to be the alert to the original owner, the alert looks to much like a basic defend run and it isn't attention grabbing at all. It's need to be reworded to something like Players are capturing your workshop and the nuke alert noise should ping once to get your attention that it's not just a npc attack wave.
---
 Could say the repetitive visual problem is a side effect of the mutation though? 
---
Thank you for your welcome but I've had the game for a few months, I don't play anymore though, can't remember what I was doing so everytime I start the game I spawn at my camp near whitespring getting killed by level 50+ ghouls instantly turning it off again haha
---
1.) get your kid off fallout or do some parenting 
---
2.) its a game, if we're accepting the logic games push smokes then we should for violence 
---
(spoilers, studies show it doesn't work like that) 
---
*Is already placing teddy bears in silly positions around the compound*
---
that's the wonderful thing about television and art in general my guy, completely subjective. while I respect that you dislike the shoe, since I enjoy it quite a lot, I would still recommend it to people so that they can form their own opinions.
---
I got bored at 65.
---
Fallout 76 - kindness.  Kindness never changes.
---
Wish I had remember the cool guys who helped me out too.  Still use 2 of the things they gave me for free or for cheap.  I was so new to multiplayer that I never thought to get their names and didn't really get what was happening until they "lone wandered" into the sunset.
---
If you are out there, I'm paying it forward!
---
I legit saw a level 300 in the first two weeks since launch. 
---
There's no way that dude is still playing. 
---
Trolls ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è good stuff dude! I assume that‚Äôs you in the picture with the leather coat tho!
---
Thanks for understanding. 
---
In all my years of playing fallout my favorite moments were in this game. I have had a lot of fun playing 76. Am I saying it‚Äôs perfect? No, dose it still have a lot of bugs? Yes, but it‚Äôs not just better then it was it‚Äôs actually a playable game now. I think as long as Bethesda continues to move in a positive direction we should be vocal but constructive.
---
Look I get it when Bethesda first announced 76 I was unhappy about the duration they had chosen to take the franchise. I has literally driving the hate train and hoping to do so right over Todd Howard. But when your best friend of 25 years, and the person who got you into playing fallout ask you to play this game you work something out. In this particular case I found it in a discount ben for half off, and I been off playing this buggy sometimes completely broken train wreck of a game ever sense. 
---
MEATats 
---
I'll see myself out
---
The ticket was about a quest not marking as complete.ticket sent before the suspension I believe but not sure 
---
No. It's the level 12. He was probably dumping all his junk for the first time ever.
---
I took a workshop once, long ago.  A worthwhile experience, but that is where most of the "wanted" signs pop up.
---
Always inspect
---
THAT! I used to leave my doors unlocked because I like to show my camp off to passerbys. But people keep leaving the damn doors open. Like hello, you're not going thru a random dungeon looting things, you're in my house. Returning to your base to see all your doors open is bad enough....watching them do it....well.....people have been killed for less right? Needless to say, my doors are all locked now. Even the interior ones.
---
I'm the highest level. Just hit 17 yesterday. I know it's pretty hard to believe, but don't worry guys you'll get there one day.
---
But for real anyone have any leveling tips lol?
---
Service questions are going to be triaged so they can help people as efficiently as possible. Tech support issues, purchased items not processing and similar issues will go to the top of the queue. 
---
Issues that have been addressed publicly, appeals for suspensions, rants or nonsense issues are going to go to the bottom. 
---
Dammit.
---
Just playing devils advocate here. I don't expect the masks to show up, but the clown costume is available in game and the atom shop. And DON'T say it's clean so it's different.
---
But if he is... *gasps*
---
I think it‚Äôs hilarious how when the enemy‚Äôs attack they all shoot at them and the one shoots confetti! I laugh everytime at the sound!
---
So you expect **others** to follow rules? That's fucking rich... 
---
i guesso, but that has nothing to do with being a chameleon
---
No way... that reminds me of the way a person used to get around in morrowind. Damn I need to that x01 jet pack. Perfect landing too lol
---
Lol Is that the leather coat he‚Äôs wearing!?
---
Nah.
---
I can kill pretty much everyone on the server since I got my perks aligned at about 90. If they're under 50 it's almost a guaranteed one shot and I've one shot numerous players over 100 in their power armor. There's nothing special about someone that high. 
---
Conversely I've run into level 65 odd players with TSE shotguns and Dragons that can one shot me with their almost certainly duped weaponry. The PvP tiers are like &lt;50, 50, 100. 
---
Again you have no proof or disproof of anything so yea 
---
1. No, worn PA is weightless
---
2. All hits trigger the effect, but it does not stack
---
3. No, only rifles and auto rifles.
---
4. Yes, demo expert buffs explosive damage of any kind, including explosive heavy weapons, but those heavy weapons wont be buffed by heavy gunner
---
I dunno. I've never seen that outfit. 
---
oooh its very necessary. As a sneak build you're prioritizing dmg output and sacrificing damage resistance, so its imperative i dont get hit. which thankfully i dont, as the last time i repaired my armor was about 5 days ago, and i play about 4 hours a day
---
Best Ive got is 150 stash + 120 search
---
Well currently outside of buying plans and recipies caps are all but useless. I assume (and you know what they say about assuming) that the cap limit was in place to choke hold people buying all the plans and such quickly. even without the dupping issue most people have probably bought what they wanted by now, so the choke hold isnt really needed anymore. so unless that add in a new use for caps (lots more plans or something) i dont see why it wouldnt be increased when player vending arrives, if only so the people who have hit the limit (like yourself) can sell to other players and still get caps.
---
option 2 is now that you have bought what you want but still hit the limit buy everything else. go get the rolling pin plan!
---
1 man army, gives a 4/8/12 % chance to stagger or cripple.
---
It's useful in a pinch when you're completely out of food but dayum is it pricey. 
---
Hang with high level players and shoot their enemies for unholy amounts of XP. Quests and Events annoyingly dont pay out much xp but is great for helping you explore and attain resources. The rule to XP is really just getting kills of high level shit.
---
Any explosive weapon and instigating works wonders for me in pvp. With some sort of armor piercing perk loaded out  
---
I love this game to death, but the one thing that drives me insane is that way too much of the rewards are based on RNG, what's the point of having skill and completing difficult challenges when everything is based on percentage and luck?
---
Thanks for the reply! Do you recommend using tenderizer and suppressor?
---
Love Fatman as well, but it is there any way to survive it? Like with power armor and perks??
---
I think in the meanwhile, you should really just create mules as needed. I have bout 60-70k over like 3 characters and I'm not even going that crazy with vending/selling. It's just too easy to hit cap
---
He's probably the 1500 hours guy that got banned and TOTALLY wasn't duping and it was super unfair and Bethesda is the worst, jk he was totally duping and then deleted everything. 
---
I mean we have plenty of people who have seen them and a few people posting about having them. There is "proof" that they are obtainable from the event, it's literally a .01% chance from what I understand. 
---
I think the problem right now is nobody believes the people that do have these masks because according to angry players here they could have only gotten it from the dev room.
---
now the question is did they take the no building bubble up that high....
---
The auction house was invented in like 2003 by FFXI online. The fact that it isn't a standard in MMOs blows my mind. It's the most useful thing I've ever seen in an online game. 
---
I may or may not play survival mode, but it makes me excited for other modes that could happen later like factions, higher level servers, and maybe even custom and private servers. Any expansion of the game is a good thing for the player base even if you don't partake.
---
That one's the Union uniform. The confederate uniform is grey.
---
Looks like you've gotten yourself into a bit of a pickle(rick). When you die, respawn at vault 76 and move your camp away from Whitesprings until you can match the enemies there.
---
It's truly based on the hours you play. I find it alot more during the hours of 2pm-8pm on the weekdays and alot more on the weekend.
---
yea its stupid to fuck over 20k people you hyped up with cool masks just so 200 people can have a collector's item sit in their stash or trade it to such a collector for 30k caps, while most people who genuinely want one are blocked off by an unrealistic barrier.
---
I really dont how what they were thinking with this. did they want to have a golden pan situation going on? if so that was really poorly executed.
---
Yes, actually. They're pretty good. You should probably just get 1 tenderizer tho, the next levels dont give as much. Suppressor you should max out tho.
---
Thanks. I tried doing that at white springs golf course, but people don't seem to farm there anymore. Do the ghouls not come in waves anymore?
---
Thanks a lot!
---
I checked. I had that question a lot for the top of AMS in Watoga as well. It seems the no build bubbles have infinite height. 
---
Finally, god damn it.
---
Then in that case yes, I think some kind of acknowledgement would have been appropriate, though there was probably no solution readily available.
---
You can. And if you have high intelligence, the created ones will have more than 100/100 charges 
---
Surely a month later though ?
---
On the other hand, dropping it will destroy it.
---
love this for us
---
If your house isn't locked up, I'm taking your water, harvesting your crops, cooking said crops in your kitchen, using your armor bench and then sleeping in your bed. 
---
Oh and lock up your resource extractor too because I'll help myself to that on general principle. 
---
Instead of allowing us to acquire more caps, how about make the caps we have worth more? 
---
They generate in proximity to players. Look inside the golf club and you'll find them, I assure you.
---
But honestly, tag with a high level player. If you get a few shots on his enemies you get XP too.
---
well that is disappointing.
---
Well... if you were on a team you could basically steal caps from anyone in a workshop by contesting it... but nuked ghouls at Whitesprings drop tons of loot and before the last patch you only needed a handful of flux to max out vendors for a day. 
---
It‚Äôs really just about not spending I would think tho. Any player who maxed vendors every day for month and didn‚Äôt spend could have that much. 
---
also typically side effects are related to the mutation itself: Egghead- sacrafice strength for perception, marsupial-sacrafice intelligence for strength, and a few others. your argument is rediculous, and i hope to never read those words in the same sentence again from a degenerate such as yourself. so im just gonna delete ur abomination of a comment. 
---
I might try it temporarily to get some of the higher priced plans at the vendors.
---
Are you sure?
---
Thanks you...... member.
---
I think that people don‚Äôt really need to see your entire inventory.  How about they only see what you put as available for sale/trade?
---
and i blocked u 
---
I didn't see a mothman until the event a few weeks ago and have never actually laid eyes on a Flatwoods monster. I'm like 350 hours in. What gives. 
---
yep it is rose.
---
Great! I don't know if I could do graveyard shifts myself, but you have to do what you have to do! I'll meet with you soon, thanks!
---
Yeah I guess the wacky weed is still wacky in Fallout world. Just stick to the chems son....and cut your hair hippie!
---
I wear it too! Though I keep the helmet off unless I need to have it in to keep the perception
---
Which one? There have been literally a dozen that I've heard of since the game came out.
---
No, I don't think duping has been patched.
---
This is exactly why I play this game!  I‚Äôm far from high level (43) but I was helped by some high level players when I was ‚Äòyoung‚Äô and I‚Äôve been paying it forward ever since. I love finding new players and helping them craft stuff. If they accept my team invite I‚Äôll go to their camp and build them a fusion generator and some work benches to get them going. I love helping people because in the end we need good people to rebuild Appalachia. 
---
Thanks that was it
---
389hrs. Damn thats not a big number. Ill assume its not covering my other characters?
---
Tysm for that btw
---
Damn thought it was a new dlc thing or something 
---
Can I ask how you get it so high?
---
Self destruct message in 5 minutes non-enclave personal are encouraged to hold onto to this message.

Hey now, give them some credit.

It‚Äôs a drugged up glorified MISS NANNY. A knockoff Mister Handy.
---
Okay, thanks for the help!
---
Look man we all be there. Strung out on psychobuff, and can‚Äôt sleep so you suddenly decide to make 40 sets of leather armor. Moomoo left this world so I could glean the secrets of the universe. 
---
Happy Fasnacht!
---
haha, have an upvote back for being a good sport
---
The garrahan for the excavator looks pretty good and the camo and patriot paint look pretty sweet on the x01
---
But I always go in the backdoor.
---
Like peanut butter and jelly, man. Lock and load.
---
Stash boxes and lootable circuits! Whats next?!?! 
---
I might have misread it, but I could SWEAR I saw someone who was over level 1000 when I was browsing the world map once.
---
...Laughs in my Blackbird xo1 paint job...
---
My problem is just spending then. I build a lot of camps and was hunting building plans since launch. I‚Äôve now gotten most all of those now, so hopefully saving should get a lot easier. Just bought my last resort building plan last night 
---
I'm good I can get them for free I'm not lazy
---
Just a 76 balancing thing. All other fallouts allowed it. But I've had a similar situation with some low leveled 20s with tse shotguns and one 100 who I assume gave it to them
---
Yup. The second part of this just happened to me. I logged into a server where my camp couldn‚Äôt be placed but didn‚Äôt place it elsewhere and the next server I was on, my camp came back.
---
You're doing ~~God's~~ Todd Howard's work, friendo. 
---
You fucker.
---
So macro blind clicks while you‚Äôre afk can earn you xp on PC I suppose? On PS4 every time I take a coffee break some friendly creatures will pay me a visit, I either end up dead or repair broken walls. 
---

*"I did my time"*

You know who says shit like that? People that did something wrong, got caught and punished, and feel they paid their debt back...

Not someone wrongfully accused...
---
They will end up in at Atom Shop lol
---
&gt; It seems like you don't understand the rules for PvP,
---
Or maybe he does and thinks they are idiotic? 
---
official comment from the poll result page is that they are dropping and its working like intended.  
---
Trading would be easier, imagine the amount of spam tho. 
---
I think it‚Äôs fair to assume that their support infrastructure was probably overwhelmed with bug reports similar to yours. As a company they‚Äôve been pretty open about having been made aware of the problems and they‚Äôve communicated fixes when they come out. While an individual response would have been nice, at this point it seems irrelevant. 
---
Would receiving a ‚ÄúThank you for your report, we‚Äôre working hard to fix these things‚Äù really have made you feel any better? Maybe, but it wouldn‚Äôt have changed the outcome. 
---
Beyond that, if you were suspended after the report, they probably aren‚Äôt going to communicate with you directly at all until the suspension is lifted. 
---
It's a seasonal event. Look at most other MMOs that have seasonal events. FFXIV, for instance, the seasonal events are always in the areas accessible to low level characters, and either involve no fighting, or fighting enemies under level 10. Because they are limited time events, and they don't want to lock new players out of them. Seasonal events are not meant to be end game content.
---
I may or may not have the Goblin mask.
---
My price is 350,000 caps and full T-108 power Armor and a Legendary Bloodied Sledgehammer
---
I dunno...  My camp is very close to Vault 76, and when I ended up building a nice house, finally put a cow pen in place, all these level 5-10 new players ended up killing it and getting bounties.  I felt kind of bad at first.  But would usually let them slide as my turrets would chase them off.  Every once in a while I'd hunt them down and take their bounty just to let them avoid getting killed by someone malicious.
---
Since Patch 7 though, I have not had any visitors killing my cow.  It's remained pretty safe.
---
A bit of a necropost here, but today I did one of the many fast travel to horde event and find nothing events at Grafton Dam.  So I cleared the SM from the area and then walked up to the prison to see if I could trigger Patrol Duty.  When I got there, I got the Horde boss flag and found a large pack of SM standing in the parking lot with the boss.  I'd say if it doesn't spawn enemies, check the nearest fast travel targets.
---
Hi Bro I‚Äôm also PS4, would u craft one for me, will pay very good üòâ
---
Nice try Bethesda. 
---
you mean like a reddit forum? i think it is called 76market or something.
---
Nuka Quantum!
---
this!
---
Yeah i‚Äôve just kinda accepted I‚Äôll never get one. I‚Äôm still running the event mostly because its consistency makes it a pretty decent and fun way to grind caps, plus I want to get all the CAMP decorations.
---
NO UR WRONG THE ONLY DLC IZ BATTLE ROYAL WEAPON SKINZ.
---
But seriously, you hit it on the head. New game mode, new content.
---
yeah r/market76
---
That is God's work son. 
---
I also have experienced various forms of crashing (server not responding and regular) between the defend portion against super mutants and the sloth spawning.
---
No worries, I'll be on later to sort you out.
---
WHAT HAVE I DONE?!
---
Ive seen a handful of mothmen, but everytime I attacked one it ran away. Thats not counting the wise one at the end of the lighthouse event. 
---
What build are you
---
No.  Not at all.
---
I'm new too, lvl 15 checking in. Doing the firebreather quest a lvl 60+ and two lvl 30+ scorched showed up and I somehow managed to kill them. Instant level and a half, so I second high level shit killing.
---
Thank you....
---
Aided the Brotherhood. In what? Probably something insignificant. So your good (or are you?)
---
People stealing my crops. I know i could do more to protect, wall em in and put a lock on the door or something. Still, c'mon dude, you don't have to take *everything* just because you can.
---
Doors automatically close would be coo.
---
They absolutely are. Workshop pvp, fine. (Though following us around the map after we'd left and they'd already taken the workshop certainly isn't fine.) Killing us for loot in the nuke zone? Attacking us at a camp? Absolutely griefing.
---
No you'd just set a macro to click a single button 30 times a second (disarm key). You would go somewhere, crouched where enemies would spawn, and do something else while your character accumulated levels extremely quickly
---
In the first month or so there were ways of grinding easy xp that were since fixed. I never looked into them so I don‚Äôt have a lot of details. 
---
No.  That's not what I said.  That is how you interpret it and it is wrong.
---
The turning in more then one data is a myth. All you need is one.
---
West Tek is actually really fun to run, especially if you switch up your weapons and play with your perk card load every couple of runs.
---
r/fo76bazaar
---
that what if is literally my whole reasoning for going on. even tho deep down i know
---
I do t understand why y‚Äôall get so obsessed with this stuff.  Sounds like you are choosing to waste a lot of time, get frustrated and angry, then blame Bethesda for your decision.
---
BOS Mods for Combat Armor cannot be learned thru scrapping.
---
The only BOS "mod" that pops up when scrapping combat armor is a chance to learn the BOS Paint job for the Combat Armor Helmet.  It can be learned by scrapping any combat armor piece (Arms, Legs, Torso) and is commonly mistaken by those who are scrapping for the BOS Mods.
---
Oh Fasnacht!
---
Perks based around grouping made it a natural fit for small scale dungeon crawl kind of game but I have a headcannon that it is all part of an overall time progression we'll see going through the patches. This is phase one "the vault dwellers emerge" followed by the other patches of us rebuilding a bit of the land, and finally another batch of vault dwellers for a "second race" that would be in our fully rebuilt world complete with human NPCs (our patch one selves)
---
Or just hang around until it meatpiles
---
How many legendaries spawn their? I found 0 when I discovered it yesterday
---
would be a good balancer.
---
One of the best ways to grind levels is to use a sneak build in a whitesprings nuke zone. You can one shit the bloated glowing ones with sneak headshots and each one will give a boatload of xp.
---
Most assholes have a buddy system to feed their ego. If they have already started using a camera that means their collective has grown a consciousness. You should check for surveillance equipment and taggings.
---
I don't think you folks understand what "rare" is.  An event that can and has been repeated 100+ times by a single player dropping an item at a 1% rate is not rare, it would be uncommon at best.  Think of how many people play and how many times that event has been repeated.  NOT EVERYONE CAN HAVE A RARE ITEM OR IT WON'T BE RARE.  
---
And its all a part of wild Appalachia, which is a dlc
---
Don‚Äôt give up. The game is hardest IMO from 15-40. 
---
If you aren‚Äôt using food or materials because you don‚Äôt need them, craft anyway. 1xp might not seem like much, but if you make 10k throwing knives and scrap them, and make more, that‚Äôs 10k XP over the life of that character. 
---
From personal experience and other anecdotes from reddit, it just means how likely you are to get a primary reward like a mask at all.
---
5 means (unless the item server bugs out) you are guaranteed to get one and the chance is decreasing with each dead bot till the event fails completely   
---
Legit question: why does it matter whether it is called DLC or not?
---
3
---
Agree totally brah. I never complain about anything and love the game, but this got me. When I was grinding for my rare TSE Leaver action and it wasn‚Äôt droping for me I found someone who sold it to me for 3000 Caps. It‚Äôs was an awesome grind and got some other cool stuff It was fun. This event was fun, but, after finding out that that almost no one is getting a rare mask and probably will never be seen or traded for any reasonable amount of in game currency. Make me second guess grinding any future events for cool stuff.
---
&gt;Workshops are worst since they allow players to attempt claim it anywhere on the workshop boundaries, 
---
And any defenses you set up seem to be completely useless.
---
Mine must be bugged. I put in three nukashine, came back an hour later, and only one was fermented. I had to remove the fermented one, came back an hour later, and again only one was finished.
---
Can you remove the skin to sell it?
---
Another PSA, painting something makes it easier to find, especially your favorite power armor since you can't &lt;3 those.
---
I could‚Äôve sworn I learned the legs through crafting, but could be wrong. Thanks for the tip
---
It‚Äôs all just crappy rng.  People are just grasping at straws for it to make sense.
---
That is one of the greatest typos I‚Äôve seen. 
---
What proof can there be? We have screenshots of people having them in their inventory, we have screenshots of people wearing them, and yet... we want proof! So, what would be proof?
---
I never even thought of crafting and scraping. Thanks!
---
People make this crap up every Fallout game.  It‚Äôs stupid that people buy into this stuff.
---
I could see a whole space themed DLC revolved around this complete with atom store outfits and power armor skins
---
Yeah my fat fingers are great at typos.
---
I agree!
---
Oh yeah?
---
The Brotherhood never tried to exterminate anybody with even a hint of mutation (which is everyone that has spent more than a couple hours outside) as, you know, a cleansing of the master race. 
---
Or stormed vaults and killed everyone inside with their scary stormtroopers just because it's part of their master plan for genetic superiority. 
---
Really, what has the Brotherhood ever really done to garner such a horrible reputation? Try to kill off the Synths? A "race" that was never once proven to have free will- and one that even the "good guy" Minuetmen end up destroying as well. Not to mention the Railroad which is meant to save them but ends up exterminating their entire species anyway. 
---
The WS farming is less while the event is on
---
Bethesda needs to implement some form of timer indication somewhere. Like, "Quest not available/cannot be repeated for X hours, X minutes."
---
If it does it'll say one it's info card, but I think only the new ones do cool stuff 
---
1) Vamp Mr. Handy Buzz Blade
---
2) Quad Explosive Harpoon gun.
---
For now just build your own camp and make up some quests.
---
People always want my tse lever action and I always have to say no it‚Äôs my baby even though the caps offers are great and I always need Caps because of my spending addiction
---
And I should also mention that I never even brought up the Brotherhood. But i should have. Their greatest accomplishment ever was more or less wiping out the wasteland Nazis. 
---
I've had up to four in a single run. Sometimes you get nothing... But on average there's a decent chance of at least two legendary spawns there. Sometimes they're right outside of the building, which is nice.
---
Some of them can't be learned from scrapping and have to be vendor bought/found. It's the same for weapons. I can link you to a couple posts on it but I'm looking at the spreadsheet now and the only BoS mod you can learn from scrapping is the helmet. 
---
Can't fast travel, I typically can only once a month, usually hovering around 1,200 burden, as I have since the B.E.T.A. (to be fair I used to sit at 5k... lol)
---
Not an ideal solution, but you could temporarily store them and just place them back when you are done. 
---
I know what you mean though, I finally got advanced power connectors and was re-wiring my place and the door was in the way, both open and closed. 
---
Ya, the skeleton mask is just the Halloween Costume stuff.  There are random events that occur at locations all over the map, sometimes they have trick or treater corpses.  These corpses have a chance to hold the plans for the costume chest and mask (Witch, Skeleton).
---
Tons of people run the event wearing them.  Very common items.
---
Explain what you mean ? Still doesn't prove anything.
---
What i am saying is this. The game you bought 4 months ago was redirected to a non-pvp oriented game because everyone said they didn't want pvp. Now they are reproducing the original game in a pvp mode. saying its new content or saying its a new mode of play is wrong. Because its not. Its what you would have played originally.
---
So in theory its not new or original content. Its the original format of the game.
---
Lmao I‚Äôd like to see a picture before we talk details. 
---
And yet it is garbage. I mean why else is there something like Tamriel Trade Center.
---
I think the frustration is felt equally, as both the casuals and 'ArdCore players have equally poor chances to get any of the Uncommon's or rares
---
Used to be before patch 7. Now its just grind.
---
I agree. that site needs some serious quest-y goodness
---
I have the coded door which is a pain in the butt when I fall out of my place. I can't keep that door open. It a little hiccup but annoying. Would be nice if they make the doors Ghost as you build :) 
---
I'm running around at level 98 with a regular LA rifle that I crafted.
---
No, and I am ok with it. If I had a rare mask after just a few runs, I probably would have stopped doing the event and then it would have given me much less community and content, Sure, I would love to find one, but I don't have all the other super rare item in the game and I have played 500+ hours and am 200+ lvls. Perhaps I will have better luck next year. I don't win every time I play the lottery and I won't win every time I go to the tivoli and play on the spinning wheels either. 
---
Idk about the sloth bug being 1/19, for me it HASNT bugged about 1/19 times lmao
---
Bravo! I really enjoyed watching your video. I do not understand why Bethesda lets players put their camp there.
---
Careful if you place that target on a foundation you‚Äôve made. I‚Äôve seen several teammates travel to workshops and get stuck in the foundation when they appear. 
---
April 9, those things are part of the vending machine update
---
Right after I posted this it happened a few more times and I lost close to a 1000 Period can't wait until Tuesday
---
Fair points
---
the games rating might be increased for using ciggies as a consumable
---
Just nuke it first, and then everything spawns at level 68.  Makes it a lot more interesting, for sure.
---
But now go and hunt down these Brotherhood Paladins before they‚Äòre going to harm our mission.
---
Personally can't fast travel, always over encumbered :(
---
If you get the super duper perk and the scrapper perk, you can swap some garbage for slightly better materials too. For example, lv 1 boards will get you the same amount of leather back, while only consuming wood. 
---
I don‚Äôt know why people want over sized, cartoon style masks. They‚Äôre so pointless. You people will wear them for a day or 2 then they‚Äôll sit in your stash forever. They‚Äôre not even cool looking masks.
---
Does not always work, but I'll happily add it...  
---
Remember no one has all the answers, hence why I have a comment at the end to add what I've missed
---
Damn! I need to make X-01 my main power armor it this how it works!
---
Where do you get the paint
---
Abbie's Bunker
---
Harper's Ferry in train car
---
Haven Church
---
General's Steakhouse x2
---
Just realized you got banned for exploiting. Yeah, no sympathy for you. Have fun waiting.
---
Unyielding armor. I play adrenal reaction with bloodied weapons. Plus 3 to all stats with unyielding when low health. I have 15 strength, plus Radicool giving 5. Some of them armor is also +1 strength. If I'm on a team it's +2 to all stats. I do about 1000 melee damage with a bloodied grognaks axe, and 1300 with my bloodied Dragon. 
---
Well that‚Äôs because most people don‚Äôt care about a mask they won‚Äôt wear. People would rather have a chance at a legendary gun or armor. Honestly the masks are all ugly as fick anyways and I don‚Äôt understand why some people want them so bad. You people will wear them for a day or 2 max and then they‚Äôll sit in your stash forever. So yeah people are more concerned with the sloth. It gives you better shit than a pointless, ugly mask.
---
To me and entitled means getting something for doing nothing.
---
 I'm not asking for a handout or free stuff I have grinded this event over 40 times with nothing but common masks to show for it.
---
 That's about 20 minutes of my time per event.
---
The drop rates are horrendous and need to be fixed for a yearly event that happens for one week and 1 week only.
---
Yeah. Like a guestbook for camp. I would love to read comments like "Hey thanks for the weapons bench." Or "You suck!"
---
Not ex0loiting but keep throwing accusations 
---
I assume a ignore function would fix that. No system is perfect but a system with group content without a chat is a worse option.
---
I will retrieve the stolen circuit board! *but let‚Äôs just say I might of stole some technical data and used it for earn some things*
---
It wasn‚Äôt your video but the title of this post itself, man, hahahaha.
---
That seems solid enough, I can agree with that so far.  But why does it matter enough to make a post? I still feel like I'm missing something here
---
That does sound like something I could have just worked out myself. 
---
Cheers for your time :) 
---
What about all the people who wanted a chance at the 7 out of 12 available masks just for completions sake?  
---
Not everyone grinding the quest is a duper, hell I doubt 1/5,000 is at this point
---
are you on PS4?
---
I actually don't use my starred stuff much for that run for this reason.  Would love to be able to lock instead.  If the lock could hide the item in trades too that'd be great.  Its my favorite, no I don't want 2k caps for it :-P
---
If you paint it, you do get the warning... but if you click thru the warning, it gets destroyed :-/
---
Of course! 
---
Heavy Gunner and Bear arms are the Strength core. I take Bandolier because I'm running around with about 14k .50-cal and 5mm ammo, so weight reduction there is essential.
---
Lock and Load may or may not be useful depending on your weapon. I'd skip it if you're using a gatling gun, it already has a fast reload. Otherwise I'd call it optional, I didn't see much of a difference. 
---
Skip Full Charge and put those two points into Master Heavy Gunner. Power User in Intelligence can double fusion core life, and I find this to have a greater effect than less power lost to sprinting. Besides, once you find some regular fusion core spawn points (there's one in the back of a van near a black bus at the Whitesprings, in a cardboard box next to two fuses,) you'll be swimming in fusion cores anyway.
---
Perception I'd say is whatever you find useful. I don't use VATS hardly at all, and prefer to keep just three points in Picklock for convenience.
---
I keep 7 points in Endurance, again, for convenience. Lead Belly 3, Vaccinated 3, and Aquagirl. No rads from food or swimming and much lower chance of enemy-transmitted disease. Since the latest patch, I sometimes swap Vaccinated for Professional Drinker to save on Addictol, but this is totally optional.
---
Charisma is also three points, and you nailed it with the Hard Bargain. Yes, more Charisma means better vendor discounts, but depending on how you play, this may mean little or nothing to you. The only other things I'd recommend are Travel Agent to save on fast travel costs, and Lone Wanderer if you play solo. If you enjoy grouping, Charisma is full of useful group perks, so take your pick. I think it's funny as hell, so I sometimes take Quack Surgeon and carry a bunch of bourbon for the heck of it!
---
Apart from Strength, Intelligence is my only other 15-point stat. Power User means I burn one fusion core every day or two (real time day,) and Power Patcher 3 means your power armor essentially never breaks. I've been running a single suit of x-01 for months and have not seen an appreciable drop in its durability. Stabilized is pure awesome. Demo Expert makes sense for a build that uses explosives. I use Gunsmith, but that's because I've found precious few explosive legendaries, and honestly found them to be lacking. 
---
Power Smith, Fix it Good, and Weapon Artisan are all great, but only useful at the crafting bench; no need to keep them on at all times. I keep Scrapper on for that 15th point, but depending on how you scrap stuff, it might be an as-needed thing.
---
I only have 5 points in Agility, and they're in Ammosmith and Thru-Hiker. Again, convenience, and whatever you find useful. Action Boy/Girl is a solid choice.
---
One Gun Army and Bloody Mess are the two Luck essentials. I haven't bothered with mutations, and Scrounger may or may not be useful depending in weapon preference. I've found that 5mm and .50-cal are pretty rare finds in the wild, and Scrounger didn't do much for me. Good with Salt is a solid choice, especially with the faster food decay rate. Luck of the Draw can be handy if you find your weapons breaking quickly. Ricochet can be helpful if you pick fights with a lot of high-level mobs, and Super Duper is essential if you do much crafting or make your own ammo.

Whew! I think that's everything for perks. As far as power armor goes, I don't think it matters all that much (depending on what you want to do in the game.) Sure, Ultracite, X-01, and T-51/60 offer better protection than Excavator, but I've seen way too many super high level people wearing Excavator armor to Scorchbeast Queen fights to believe it makes all that much of a difference in regular PvE. This of course may vary depending on play style, build, and weapon choice but with Calibrated Shocks, Excavator gives me 425 carry weight and that's hard to beat, even with lower protection.
---
One consideration: without Power Patcher, it may be necessary to actually repair your armor from time to time, and T-60 requires WAY less repair material than anything else.
---
weird one, I'll build a box and see if I can remove it.
---
That would make sense. I mean it is a 50s themed game. Everyone smoked during that time hence the cigarette dispensers. Could add +2 to perception for 30 mins and slow the rate of hunger for an hour.
---
Thanks for reminding me, forgot to include that one, had the same problem.
---
Given Bethesda‚Äôs history with updates backing out previously implemented bugs accidentally, I‚Äôm willing to bet everyone getting unbanned was a unintentional . I doubt they would have relied on people just happening to log in to see if they could play.... I‚Äôm sure they will send something to all affected players when the ban is lifted.  Until then, they aren‚Äôt going to reply to every person banned when they‚Äôve already stated their position. 
---
You weren‚Äôt told the next update was going to lift then and, you were told it would be happening soon.  To Bethesda, that could mean with at the end of Wild Appalachia full implementation 
---
You know rare means *rare* right? As in ‚Äúnot very many people will get one because they‚Äôre rare‚Äù  I mean that is the very definition of rare.
---
People just want to collect and also to have something to work for in the game I think.  I was disappointed with the rare mask implementation at first, but then realized that I think the same way that you do.
---
Try to get your hands on the cranberry relish recipe. Not hard to make and gives you +10% xp. Well rested gives you +5. In a team you can use a Cha perk for +15%. Upcoming survival is supposed to give you +20%. Potentially, that‚Äôs a huge amount of extra xp per kill. 
---
Now I totally get where you‚Äôre coming from, but games like GTA and TV Shows like the boondocks using that language doesn‚Äôt help your case. But I‚Äôll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you‚Äôre talking about the online interaction between players. When you start to think about that, there‚Äôs a few problems. One: you can voice communicate so stuff like that can already happen. Two: if something like that does happen are you going to let it affect your being or are you going to be a bigger person and brush it off. And Three: There are plenty of ways to avoid those types of people.
---
Inevitably in our world we will endure many forms of prejudice, and moreso you will experience that online behind a screen. I‚Äôm more than sure if something like this was to come into fruition there would definitely be filters, I just think that us being grown ass adults need to not only act like grown ass adults, but handle situations like grown ass adults by not letting it get under your skin
---
You should check the roadmap, it has the dates for all the upcoming updates and events
---
LOL
---
Not all of the engine has been decoded by the fantastic people behind XEdit, so we can't be sure, and some of the data is server side and we don't have access.
---
Uh huh; poor soul got banned due to a mistake.
---
TNT dome 7 after about 1000 other steps and hours of server hopping.
---
Best military circuit board place I've found is a little concrete hut near the mines. 5 every time I've been. 
---
We've not decoded everything in the Engine, but a good deal of what we have on our end is the same as Server side, otherwise we would not be able to find and identify so many of the issues in '76
---
The explosive effect and it being automatic makes them lose durability faster
---
I do.  The other playlist is so short compared to previous fallouts.  Like suddenly 50s music is the rage and too $$$?
---
Does not always work, it will sometimes lose all Collision, so it can't be interacted with at all.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt need anything that you didn‚Äôt already get. AFAIK the weapons from that quest are the only ones you can level up. 
---
But yeah as long as you have the blade of Bastet or... the other one whose name I can‚Äôt remember, you should have the option in weapon crafting to craft a leveled version using the already complete one as a material. 
---
I just looked up a video
---
TSE weapons are still very powerful and a good roll, but no where near the power of Bloodied explosive weapons. They are the ones one shotting everything at this point.
---
There‚Äôs been a ton of testing done since launch, you can also check with the Awareness perk which will show you enemy DR
---
Had a friend on that server who was doing quests
---
Oh I mean accusing me with no proof violates subreddit rules. Tired of arguing my innocence when there's no proof of guilt. I have a full video of my inventory recorded 5th of this month  that proves innocence however 
---
They kill off Ghouls, reasonable mutants, and for all we know, they HAVE stormed vaults and killed the residents. They‚Äôre just as bad as the Enclave, we‚Äôre only made to see them as good guys.
---
The fix for this is to not move after selecting the build camp option.
---
1. Select build camp in the pipboy.
---
2. Move around until you find your spot, DO NOT confirm. Cancel out of the menu.
---
3. Select build camp in the pipboy again.
---
4. Place camp.
---
If you didn't move the second time, it should cost the amounts quoted.
---
Also try and get the perks scrounger and pharma pharma as soon as you can. One is for finding extra ammo and the other for finding extra chems. Once you get them be sure to search ammo crates and aid boxes. A lot of people don‚Äôt realize you have to do so to get the extra supplies
---
Don‚Äôt care about downvotes. 
---
If they managed to jury rig such a system into such an ancient engine that wasn't built for multiplayer, I'd be impressed. Not gunna lie. 
---
I glossed over a lot of the content. Certainly don't help myself when I then want more information! I'll give it another look :) 
---
I'm sure you might have a better chance now since the initial wave of people got through it lol 
---
I am convinced that it used to, and that the content was cut. Right now, it serves almost NO purpose in the game, and has almost NO connection to any of the lore or storylines.
---
I mean, theyre supposed to be rare though, i think it would be extra cool to actually see somwone with one or actually have one yourself this way as opposed to "everyone who plays everyday will have 1 by the end of the week" rare.  
---
Kind of like how fancy cars nowadays are kinda rare but nothing extreme, but a vintage 1930s only 600 ever made car is something else to see
---
I think it‚Äôs funny when people come to trade and just request everything you‚Äôre using. Especially armor, I usually only carry the armor that I am wearing so if you don‚Äôt see multiple right arms in there then likelihood is that is the armor I‚Äôm wearing an not for sale, but you still request it and then stab me when I don‚Äôt sell it?
---
Just for comparison 700+ hours = level 171
---
I spend a lot of time exploring, crafting, building but I do nuke events when I find them, so someone more interested in leveling would be significantly higher level.
---
Why not one shot melee people while we‚Äôre at it?
---
You ain‚Äôt heard nothin yet.
---
Thanks!
---
TFW people still blame tse even though they were nerf nuked and dropped way down on the legendary scale
---
tfw my tse pipe bolt doesn't 1 shot since the nerf and is still a "problem weapon"
---
tfw OP is probably dealing with bloodied builds
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/4ztuP
---
You could be correct, but with them being instanced and unable to be picked up when they respawn it can prevent advancement, which I'd think does qualify as a bug / unintended effect.
---
This is great. I'm not a PA user but I've always wondered how far someone could fly across the map if they spammed sugar.
---
Really?  
---
What platform?
---
Wow, thank you so much! This is very useful info and I‚Äôll definitely base my build around your recommendations.
---
I finally found someone to make me one already but thank you anyway! :)
---
No shit sherlock. I think you are choosing to be willfully ignorant of my point here which is a tactic used by people who dont want to argue the facts but rather their own narrative.
---
The only BoS mod you can learn from scrapping is the helmet unfortunately. 
---
The others you'll have to hunt down as people have suggested. 
---
- Nuka Cola Power Plant. Go to main entrance, up the stairs on the left or right, continue into the main hallway, you'll see a locked level 0 door on the left, open it. Go inside stall, close door, first keycard is laying up against the wall behind the stall door.
---
- Tanagra Town. Go up to the top. You'll see a white house split in half, it's on the second floor of the house that's sliding down.
---
b. There's a locked warehouse door with a keypad at Tanagra Town but on the ground level, code is 748250, there's a plan for Shielded Lining Operative Armor there.
---
- Crashed Plane, below the plane hanging from the trees and vines you'll see some suitcases, this one is somewhat in the air (above the water at least) hanging by vines, you should see a keycard in there.
---
- Ingram Mansion. THis is is tricky. Kill everything there, towards the back of the house near a armor workbench you'll see a broken window, go inside and use the terminal. Generate a one time key. You'll have to be fast since if another player uses that terminal your code is gone.
---
- Overlook Cabin near the lake by the forest, right side of it. Go inside the cabin, go into the basement all the way to the back, you'll see two keycard readers on each side of the wall. Use them. A hidden door will open with a keypad, use your one time generated code. Then another hidden door will open. Grab the TNT Dome Key 7
---
- Black Mountain Ordinance Bunker. As soon as you spawn in, take about 10 steps forward, turn your camera angle 90 degrees left, and go straight until you hit the Dome. Unlock it and it should be on a desk to the left. If not server hop until it's there.
---
Correct.  Pectin is also found in good quantities in Strawberries.  Hence why some strawberry jam recipes don't need pectin. 
---
And while pectin helps, the big preservative in jams is the sugar.   I'm also imagining salt can do the same in canning, when making a brine to can in . 
---
Except you posted a thread about you getting suspended (someone linked it a couple posts under mine).
---
Hmm, and you even seem to have deleted it? That‚Äôs odd, one would figure someone who has done nothing wrong would have nothing to hide.
---
If you join a team as long as someone from your team assists in the kill you should be able to pick up loot.  So this isn‚Äôt necessarily a statement directed to folk complaining about the TSE use, I understand your situation....  Who it is directed at is the TSE user.  Come on folks, team up and hook a low level up. You never know, you might find a new friend.
---
Yeah Docker's clothes
---
Myself I only have Normal Weapons, I only bought ammo or sale of ammo. Most time don't bother to even look at weapons in someone inventory. I don't carry more then I need. I mostly drop item for others. Caps are hard to grind so I don't pay for much. Now it getting this dam Flux is a pain in the ass. Took me two weeks to build up caps for Calibrated Legs for T-60 now need dam Violet Flux. Pain in the ass.
---
Here is the problem, not all of them were supposed to be "Super Rare"...   
---
There is "Uncommon" and "Rare" masks, it seems like we have a different definition of "Uncommon" than Bethesda/Zenimax.  
---
How about everyone play however they want? Thanks.
---
Because before people can get up to melee them they are already dead due to tse. I‚Äôm not to worried about it they do take some time to kill as long as you know where the legendaries will spawn and can get a hit in on them your good but them causing the idle body glitch is annoying.
---
Yeah 
---
Because as I said I'm tired. Il post the video not that it will do any good 
---
Let alone one of the "Uncommon" masks
---
I will circumcise you with my vampires serrated machete and use your foreskin to make MooMoo VI a nice pair of shoes 
---
Also still witch hunting 
---
It's stupid that you can't take the Old Man Winter mask that's on the effigy - it's even just sitting in one of the buildings before the parade begins!
---
Hmm. I didn't spam sugar. This happens with a combo of the trap, birdbones and jetpack. 
---
Can't wait for PvP servers which open very soon! All the TSE bloodied users to one shot me! Ima make a new charchter for it so I can get the full shat-on experience!
---
It‚Äôs stuns me that there are SO many people who went out of their way to buy a duped weapon. Is getting a tse as simple as asking? 
---
Hi, ps4, can I have one too? I wonder if someone will contact me, if it really is so easy. 
---
I‚Äôm on lvl 150ish and I‚Äôve found an explosive level action and a 10mm, neither are 2shot and I‚Äôve played hundreds of hours (but not grinded Whitesprings hundreds of times like so many others). Someday I‚Äôll find a nice one. 
---
You're joking but I think it is. For whatever reason parents will buy their damn 8 year old a game like 76 or Mortal Kombat without batting an eye. Gibbing a super mutant with an axe and then eating its corpse are okay but if you could *SMOKE!?* Think of the children!
---
When the level 91 glowing death claw random event happens there is a earthquake-like shake.
---
It‚Äôs clear what they need to change, the PVP terrible. The amount of bugs are still unacceptable for a triple A game. Server wide lag, I thought that it might be my connection. But it was just when fighting the scorchbeast queen. 
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love fallout. Bethesda are capable of so much more. And Fallout 4 wasn‚Äôt what it could have been and neither is fallout76. 
---
Yes. A lot of the beers now have unique perks that do a lot. 
---
People always gettin mad that I won't sell them my blade of bastet. 
---
[Redacted]
---
I'll sell it for you
---
I've played the event at least 30 times now and have not received any of them. Nor have I seen any of them in the inventories of the 50+ people I have traded with, nor has anyone here come forward and said with proof that they have any of them. They're bugged. They aren't dropping.
---
1. He may have had a teammate trigger the capture.  I think this puts you in pvp with the whole team.
---
    
---
2. Taking workshops opens you up for pvp.  As soon as the workshop is contested, you are in pvp mode with the other player/team.
---
Report me if it makes you happy. Hopefully a mod will stand up to defend an obvious exploiter.
---
I've lived through a decade of TF2 and fifteen years of playing Pokemon. No Unusuals, and I've only ever found one Shiny in the wild. I know the feeling all too well.
---
Low-chance drops are a staple of gaming that needs to be yanked out and never used again.
---
Ha!  
---
Only reporting on what I've personally observed, in your case have you see the Sloth Die before it finishes transforming into a Legendary?  
---
I do not care
---
The jester mask I would actually use periodically, and maybe the toothy mask. The rest I won't. 
---
Workshops are fair game to pvp
---
FO4 had an avalanche of songs I thought would be good in the next Fallout (I have a thread from years before it came out that matched up with a number of the final choices) and almost every song in 76 I already had on my phone. 
---
My friend hates Country Roads so I make sure to kareoke it every time it comes in through his headset. 
---
COMMUNIST DETECTED ON AMERICAN SOIL: LETHAL FORCE ENGAGED
---
For Real!
---
It was most likely a team of people. They look to see who owns the shop, one fast travels near you, sneaking. One begins to take the shop and the other kills you. PVP starts immediately when a team begins to take a work shop.
---
Destroying your camp was most likely the team trying to get you to retaliate so they could keep killing you. I stear clear of workshops for this reason. I dont like having to watch my back when I'm in the middle of something.
---
Awaiting orders sir! However, this grunt was too busy polishing his blaster to and detailing his armor to be in the know on this assignment. Please dm with specifics. Through loyalty and fortitude, our... little enclave will become mightier than that which the BoS cower from.
---
yes to this
---
They're not rare, they're bugged. 
---
Maybe collecting things is fun... 
---
This made me laugh more then it should of 
---
TSE users have been and always will be for the foreseeable future the dumb knuckledraggers of 76. 
---
I legit think if they removed them from the game half the players would quit on the spot and tell anyone who will listen that the game is way too hard. 
---
I also have problems with gauss not hitting with 95% chance, sometimes it seems I charge her up and let go and nothing happens.
---
Just gotta learn to game the system.
---
Vendor cap stashes respawn after 20h, it isn't a set time of day or anything.
---
You gotta strategically fast travel, utilizing your CAMP, V76, workshops if controlled, cause you can travel to those for free. Hoof it between the shorter distances (Top of the World to Whitespring to Enclave for example).
---
Definitely invest on travel agent &amp; hard bargain, both under charisma. 
---
I am also having this exact same issue.  I buy nothing because I am also using all my caps just to fast travel.  You aren‚Äôt the only one struggling with this so don‚Äôt feel bad.  I feel just as dumb
---
Gamers üëè are üëè the üëè most üëè oppressed üëè minority üëè 
---
I‚Äôll be online later so I‚Äôll have a proper look and get back to you, many people find it best to stack specific perks but I‚Äôve gone for a slightly more generalised build. A lot of it will be trial and error to find what best suits you style of play.
---
Great, thank you! I have the steak house 2, but not the train car, bunker or church. Is the General's Steak house even IN the mire? I thought it was in Cranberry Bog? Anyway, that's 3 I can go verify and add to my list. You checked them since the stash nerf, I presume? :)
---
i love the hairstyle of [Rosalynn Jefferies](https://i.imgur.com/mFcug4n.png)

and would love to see more raider styled clothing, makeup and hairstyles, to complete the look
---
iam aiming for. 
---
Speaking as a british soldier i can say we dont reslly need any more military realism in the game since the army has a great way of taking everything you know and love and making it shit
---
Sign me in for the Gym at Vault 76

1400 per day. Each vendor has 200 and many share this pool. You have to hit specific vendors and next day do the same. There's some I hit. I do Flatwoods, Whitesprings, Enclave Vendor, Watoga station, Watoga shopping plaza. Sometimes hit the Harper's Ferry.
---
I use the following.
---
http://dulfy.net/2018/11/22/fallout-76-vendors-locations-and-factions-guide/
---
I have an online friend who is a 522. So I'm betting the highest is around 700
---
I just grabbed the Graham Mining power armor paint skin the other day from the Atomic Shop, just paint for thought, it looks and feels great, you should try it out! 
---
Or anti armor.  Or instigating.  Or really any weapon with the right set of perks, mutations, and drugs.  These aren't scorch beasts we're talking about.  
---
There's nothing wrong with asking for a bit of etiquette.
---
Mine died in an Enclave resource run when she was attacked by an unknown person only going by "xXPu55yxD3STR0Y3RXx"
---
Never done it before. I've run nuke zones but never went to look just for legendaries as what I'm doing in game that day. 
---
I like them the way they are, not terribly common. It's also kind of fun to search the vendors for something that you were never going to run across yourself. I've probably picked up 90% of my legendary armor from vendors. 
---
My favorite thing I've seen is "you would run too if you saw a power armored player coming to rip the gun out of your stomach"
---
Slow down there, Graham
---
At least it's not Glowing Mass. That would be a concern.
---
Shitty design is not a competition. "It could be worse" is not a defense.
---
They'd be walking bullet sponges with their depleted cores 
---
They kill off FERAL ghouls. I do that all the time. Am I a Nazi? I imagine you do too Nazi. The Brotherhood has never once attacked a normal ghoul settlement. Not once. 
---
And what reasonable mutants are you even talking about?
---
Also, you can't prove somebody is something by saying that they might have done something with no proof or evidence. You may have touched little boys. I dont know you havn't. Are you a pedophile because if that one fact? Of course not. 
---
How have the Brotherhood been "made to see them as good guys"? We are omniscient viewers of the story. We can replay the game and see it from any angle. Nothing is really all that hidden from us. 
---
And all I see is the Brotherhood trying to save the world that has turned to pure shit. Sure they are misguided sometimes. Sure their military style of order and governance might come across as overly strict to our western 21st century style of living. 
---
But again, what have they ever done that is all that bad? Put their lives at risk to fight against mutants and raiders that prey upon civilians?
---
The enclave tried to kill all of those people. 
---
Literally nobody who claims allegiance to the Enclave can point their finger and judge anybody's morality. 
---
Surprisingly, my camp was only destroyed once and it was because someone nuked Helvetia when I was afk. A lot of people visited when the fasnacht event would end and would either play music on the patio or use the workshop I had set up it was always cool makin friends that would want to show me their camp after visiting, I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll pop back up after the event!
---
And a greater pool of perk cards. 
---
That's great. I am noob to 76. It is hard out in these wastelands. Need a companion too. 
---
I got so lucky when I did it. As soon as I saw the video come up I did and I got every keycard and key and the plans on my first try. Then not even an hour later I see a massing of people fast traveling to each location including Black Mountain Ordinance Bunker and I never felt so relieved 
---
Charlestown building height stops and you can build on top of the tallest building there
---
The problem in my mind "Uncommon" is like a USA $2 Bill...
---
You don't see them in every day transactions, but if you go out of your way to get a couple (Go to a couple banks until you find one with them in stock) you'll have them with only a moderate amount time/work invested.  
---
In gaming terms it would be like an item with a 1/50 or 1/75 chance, where a day or two of "grinding" nets you one of them.  
---
But in this case Uncommon seems to indicate about a 1/6,000 chance to get or see one....
---
"Rares" for most people would be like farming Bosses in many other MMO's...   (1/100 to 1/1,1000)
---
It's hard, takes forever but because you see the "Uncommons" during the cycle which keeps your spirits up and drives you to repeat the "grind" countless times.
---
Yeah I agree a chat would just solve every trading problem. But Bethesda listen, don't be all Bethesda and mess it up. Let us chat while in trade

---
Is having no life considered a glitch? I'm at 170 but haven't played in well over a month. I'd probably be up past 250 if I was playing regularly since I got the game
---
I got lucky and got the cards and key first try...the actual plan itself was a different story lol
---
Here's the thing...Everyone is asking for all these semi obvious items in game. This is because its all there already right in front of our noses. It's just going to be developed and released over time. They themselves said they planned to create content for many years. You can feel much of the world already screaming to tell its story. I can name a fistful of places that have doors and areas that i just know are going to be transformed into a quest or a new area of exploration.  I only hope the game hasn't died in popularity too much so to make  all of what they planned come true.
---
For the Quest Completes successfully but fails to reward Items or XP, I've fixed it by running all the way out of Helvetia till the timer for the "You are leaving event" reaches 0 and then reentering and waiting till the timer reaches 0 again, the quest usually pops up. Also you need to participate in at least some part of the event, seen people just walking around or AFKING to get the hats.
---
Yea this is 900hour guy if I'm not mistaken.
---
They emailed him showing the items he got suspended for and the amount of ultracite he had was highly suspect
---
Sometimes vendors show zero caps but sell 1 bobby pin and it should change to 199 caps.  
---
I found that in about 1/15 runs in the super mutant phase the robots won‚Äôt move at all, even after all of the mutants have been killed. When this happened the first time, we had 16 people there looking for mutants but couldn‚Äôt find any.
---
I'd be down for gas masks tbh, it's already a nice concept that you take damage and sludge lung in those smoked out caves in the ash heap
---
Interesting, so you can keep disarming something that should only be disarmed once I suppose. Definitely an exploitable glitch right there. 
---
It wont let me store the holotapes  in my stash.
---
Well, I meant they should change it to that. The CAMP device becomes the fastvtravel point since it‚Äôs already in the game.
---
I've been on a server with a 627 I think, it was a week or two ago.
---
Even worse is when you edit your build and pick a door up, you lose any lock you had on it. Pretty sure you don't get your screws and springs back either. 
---
Well at least you got the key the first try, since from what I've heard that's a once in a server spawn just like the plans, but to get the key you have to go through a lot more
---
Yay I won‚Äôt be replacing it then! Thanks for the heads up
---
The game is dadgum awesome, dadgummit!
---
No it fucking doesn't! Auction houses ruin games lile this and would fuck up the market. Youd get botters all God damn day long. Dont you ruin this game. 
---
Bump..
---
What‚Äôs your point OP?
---
NO RESTRICTIONS ON Survival mode. No pacifists no crying or whining allowed.
---
You go in knowing everyone on is kill or be killed. The quests are just a distraction.
---
I have a single star furious tommy gun. Is that worth using instead of an explosive 10mm or similar?
---
I got mine from claiming/defending workshops. But I think you can also buy them from the Harper's Ferry vendor
---
I don't get why you really care? Cigarettes are fucking gross anyway. Also if you used them in game it would just be a negative effect and you'd become addicted. It would be a pain in the ass
---
I do all those things. Its part of the game. The word you are looking for is raiders. 
---
Not griefing. Never was. Grow a pair or block and server hop. 
---
Which I appreciate...
---
And now I feel bad about my previous post. I didn't mean to say any bodies hands were mangled or anything.

);
---
Realistically though the games is never supposed to be about grinding for stuff, as much as people on here say it is, grinding for stuff if for hardcore gamers to get what they want when they want it and is, in essence, an exploit, i dnt see it as a bad exploit but its not how games are designed to be played so to simply say that grinding should net you thee things would just encourage people to grind.  
---
Out of all the posts ive seen of people saying the game isnt fun, 95% of them were post saying how they were grinding things instead of playing how its designed to be played.  
---
Now before anyone takes this the wrong way im not saying your wrong to grind for things but the game simply isnt designed that way and shouldnt be catered to grinding

The Fallout universe has figured out nuclear fusion. It wouldn't be far off to assume that they don't face the same scientific issues we do today, at least in regards to space installations.

Yeah that's what I've been saying. Just add a Grand Exchange like in OSRS
---
Wow had actions houses in all capital cities (were some of them connected ? Cant remember) and it was def quite nice to be able to buy/sell stuff in trade hubs.
---
There‚Äôs definitely different kinds of cigarettes- I know people who smoke native cigarettes they get from a reserve. I tried one, as a heavy smoker, and it amostly brought me to my knees after one drag. If that‚Äôs what your smoking, yeah it‚Äôs gonna kill you. 
---
Same here wait till he becomes meat pile then hope I get anything. Most time I drop my reward and leave. One good thing is my camp has been next to this town for over a month so skin off me to fast travel. 
---
I'm sorry to say but you are doing it slightly wrong but don't worry it's an easy fix.
---
Firstly it seems you may not be aware of faction vendor caps. There are 7 different vendor factions each with their own cap pool. 
---
On the left side of the map it is the Responders 
---
In the middle it is The Raiders, Whitesprings and the Enclave
---
On the right hand side there are several different ones such as The Free states, Brotherhood of steel and Watoga 
---
In total you can get 1200 caps per 24 hours if you hit up all the different vendors.
---
each faction shares a cap pool of 200 caps so if you clear out any responder vendor the others will have no caps either for 24 hours. server hopping won't help.
---
Secondly you shouldn't need to buy any screws ever! If you select the search for item when your looking at it in your pip boy anything with screws in it will have a little magnifying glass next to it before you pick it up. You should select various items you will need such as Gears, Springs, screws, alluminum etc.
---
If your on PS4 add me - alteron_command (I am level 120+ ) and I will be happy to meet up on the game and show you how or give any other advice.
---
If you not on PS4 just ask me on here and I will do my best to explain things :)
---
there are also a lot of helpfull videos on YouTube on the same subject. you can watch 
---
https://youtu.be/L9oDy1HzAY4  for junk tagging. it's quite helpfull. (not my video) 
---
I don't quite understand, to ne honest. You didn't realize that those effects exist, or that armor can have more than one effect?
---
There is actually a US covert operations manual magazine that makes it so enemy vats has a - 50% chance to hit you. Some of the temporary bonus effects can actually be pretty useful in PvP.
---
Oh hunny you know it! I'm the author of Another post on CS post "nerf" (i actually find it more lucrative but that's me). Search "granny" on the sub and you'll find it. We should compare our notes!
---
Also consider using the CHA perk that speeds up healing with stims and radaways. I just recently got back and decided to switch to a PA HeavyWeapons build and having faster healing will go a long way if you decided to play on Hardcore PvP mode where you only can have 1 stimpack active at a time. 
---
Kill players. Get caps. 
---
3k to 10k is a typical day for me. 
---
What part goes this attach to? I'm almost done building my x-01 and watched the added weight feet first.
---
I just went to tnt dome 7 , door was closed but not locked . Plans were inside :) did it 3 times in a bout a hour .
---
Still better than any MMO that has an auction system. LOTRO and WOW are the best examples i can give, where years of inflation mean that if you're a new player everything, including entry level crafting materials, gear, etc is usually prohibitively expensive 
---
Good info thanks! 
---
**Questions:**  
---
\-When you let it get it to zero, are you letting it fully expire or you run back in as it hits zero?  
---
\-If you are letting it fully expire, how do you get the quest to pop back in again as it's officially over?  
---
I always participate on my main (primary of the 4 accounts, doing hand ins and defending) and have had it happen multiple times.
---
I didn't say used a cheat, he cheated pvp by what I would call an exploit of the pvp system. 
---
Not griefing
---
I appreciate the effort. Someone else answered in this thread already so you could read it to avoid wasting your time by writing the same. If you have anything to add or want to show your build I would be very interested!
---
It's also the most potentially destabilising to a game's economy. Look at LotRO and WoW
---
Are you seriously saying there is tobacco that wont inevitably give you cancer? 
---
If so, why would anyone smoke anything else? Tobacco can and will give you cancer, there is no ‚Äùsafe‚Äù tobacco.
---
Someone should show this guy what bloodied builds can do.
---
Don‚Äôt really need to use booze or chems (and no booze existed before patch 7 that boosted ranged damage) to get big numbers, it‚Äôs all in a bloodied build. 
---
It‚Äôs pretty cheap to repair a CAMP all things considered. I do think your CAMP location should be hidden unless you allow it to be though, even if you‚Äôre in a party with someone
---
Thanks for the info!  
---
\-What Platform?  
---
\-How many total events have you done?
---
\-Does the "Master" keep talking and playing music?
---
Just walk. Gather bundle sell. Make a path, explore.
---
At one point I had to start buying all the plans in white springs cause I was capped out.
---
You have 2 options to increase lever action dmg
---
1) invest in plans to physically increase the damage via mods.
---
2) invest in rifleman perks 
---
My silenced lvl 45 lever action does 104 dmg, x3.5 with long shot and +2 rifleman 
---
Not including the stealth sneak perks. +50%? For silenced kills.
---
Approximately 312?
---
You took a workshop which flags you for pvp. You weren't griefed. 
---
And you deleted that thread HAHAHAHAHA
---
Holy fuck... If *that* doesn't scream guilty I don't know what does... 
---
I'm not mad, 200 caps is nothing. I'm just mad the pvp system can be easily cheesed by people who know the ways to abuse the system. Not everyone knows they could free transport to vault 76, and if I were over encumbered, my best chance to leave that cycle would be to quit the game and load a new server. I was stuck in pvp and couldnt leave. 
---
You should play scum instead.
---
It has a lot of what you‚Äôre referring to and will put the rest in over time.
---
Oh 100% an exploitable glitch. It was in the game for a month or two though so the damage was done. You'd have a lobby full of level 26-40 and then some dudes at 150-200. You could tell immediately who did the glitch just by glancing around.
---
How about Cigars. Rather have that then cigarettes  
---
Obviously the plans are yours to do what you want, but if you have extra, give them away to players who don't have them. So many people are getting screwed by people farming it and scalping it to innocent players. I'm not trying to tell you what to do, it's what I've been doing. Going to the Dome everytime I log on and giving them out to people so hopefully lessen the scalping on the once in a server plans.
---
Do you smoke?
---
If the answer is yes then you'll know why. Leave a pack of cigs unattended for a week or two and you'll feel like you are smoking sawdust. I shudder to think what it would be like smoking 20+ year old cigs
---
I think that might be coming in the future I‚Äôm not sure though. 
---
It's pretty easy. What exactly is it that you don't understand?
---
Yes by removing the paint it can be sold, traded, or dropped. 
---
Yeah that‚Äôs not how it works, camp move cost is based on your level... at least, the ‚Äúposted‚Äù cost is!
---
My thoughts are, in the release of sheer terror, we will see the implementation of new cryptids but also backstories and research into existing in-game cryptids such as the flatwoods monster which I believe the crashed station would be an excellent plot point in it's backstory.
---
I think so. I don't think its possible to get them. Anyone that says they have it is a liar or a dev room glitcher. I've done the event at least 100 times. Never had the rare mask and I'm still doing it every time it shows up. I think Bethesda just doesn't know how to code. I'm willing to come and show them if they would like
---
Hey...
---
He "did his time"
---
Hahahaha
---
Coffee cups vases give ceramic
---
I‚Äôll add that the extreme rarity of the rare and uncommon masks ( are they even accessible through normal play?) has made all other masks and plans worthless.  They are available in such abundance that they have little to no value.  Combine that with the low level of difficulty and the problem is exacerbated. You get an easy event that gives very little reward. 
---
Hey, will do! Thanks! And do you mind giving me a hint as to which train car in Harper's Ferry I should be looking in? There are an awful lot of them, haha.
---
CAMPs are already mobile 
---
I had to Google it, too. Great New Word.
---
Regardless of what may have been said, it's not as intended. It would be absurd to have a mechanism that unbulks all of the things that have been intentionallky bulked to sell. 
---
It didn't work that way when the game was originally released. The problem was that other things were unintentionally getting bulked too. 
---
Also keep in mind that if you're a commando using automatic weapons, a 90 damage output is pretty damn good when you multiply it by ROF.
---
At level 31, I am just now struggling with being over my weight limit consistently so walking is my only option.  I spend most all of my time in the forest area and the mining area, as it‚Äôs the only 2 parts of the maps I am remotely able to survive.  So there are designated cap spawning locations?  I will look this up.  Thanks for responding and giving advice 
---
Well I feel pretty dumb. I've got his daily quest now and of course I cannot find rum ANYWHERE lol
---
The flexibility of cards is very important actually, for instance sometimes you might need only one point of Heavy Gunner in order to make room for carrying weight boost perk, some other times you want to max it out at 3 for a queen battle. 
---
Music critics?
---
I suggest changing the music from 70s AM gold to 90s grunge.  Lolz
---
I always put a lock on my C.A.M.P door and close it if I have taken a workshop somewhere and am in my main camp to stop this exact thing. If you have turrets around your camp and somone tries to unlock your door the turrets will open fire and either kill them or at least let you know someone is there.
---
A while ago I made a trap base with a level 1 lock on the door but when you went inside there was another locked room with 3 missile turrets ready to destroy whoever came inside. 
---
I was often in my base doing something and I would hear the turrets go off haha. Doesn't happen much anymore though as there's nothing to be gained from destroying someone's camp. 
---
when player vending comes in I am going to make a maze and if someone survives to the end the items are free to collect. :) does that sound fun? 
---
I'm sorry. I'll stop contributing to the SBQ then. /S
---
In all seriousness who the fuck are you to tell the rest of us how to play?
---
This would be ideal. I tend to avoid trading because I get tired of people begging me for shit I don't want to trade. Like my fusion cores. Yes, I have 10 full charged in my inventory. No that doesn't mean I have "plenty to spare". 
---
If it's not about grinding (and I agree there it's not supposed to be designed around that) why have they made so many things effectively impossible to get without doing exactly that?  
---
Best example are the Tier 3 or higher plans, which for 3 months were literally impossible to get without grinding.     
---
Bethesda seems to have trouble (no offense intended) with managing "Uncommon" and Rare drops

---
amen. 
---
Yeah but no one can show proof that they got it from the event. No one. 
---
i tend to not do any "techniques" considering we are relying on bethesda's servers to keep us stable.  swap your parts, collect your chassis, and deposit it.  don't do anything crazy, imo.  if you're on PC i have like 250 black tit i can give.
---
My tse bloodied assault rifle got nerfef to shit with the patch but if youre still good it doesnt matter lol. People just like to complain when they lose. Myself included

Look up steve mres on youtube. Dude enjoys smoking old mre cigs.

Yep.  I don‚Äôt want to add more to the crapping on Bethesda, but it just doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot of thought and effort went into a lot of this stuff.
---
Right, but clothing is typically still locked to a full body set. You can't mix and match pieces, you can't elect to have armor showing on parts where the clothing would expose it, etc. Some outfits work this way, which means that it's not any kind of engine limitation, but laziness to implement full functionality.
---
These were all fairly basic mods in other fallout games.
---
No. They would be playing against people that are outside their gear level. The same point being made here
---
Here's what I observed this weekend when I was grouped up and at the WS nuked:
---
We went South on road by the wrecks that have Glowing Ones nearby and Ultracite nodes across the road. We killed the Ghoulies and then took turns 'touching' Ultracite and when I tell you we had a Constant Spawn in of Scorched. 6-8 for each touch. I have no idea if this is intended but I don't know why more Players don't farm this because you can Nuke Flora, touch Ultracite and then farm the Scorched for all the HM GM IF stuff you need.
---
Braver man than I, though i mostly roll my own so if yoh ask me straights are ass nasty anyway
---
Honestly I think your fine as long as you just dont finish the event i dunnofor sure though 
---
Best way to save caps is to stay over encumbered. That way never fast travel.
---
Keep giving them away, I do too.  It crashes the price of the plans when they keep showing up for free in the Overseers camp.
---
I had a similar experience in Oblivion. It involved the Gray Fox and a Orge. 
---
Just stop playing? 
---
I'm not a fan of the change but this community has to understand the difference between a bug and an intentional change. They've commented on the change as a fix to the "problem" of bulked scrap not being available for use in crafting. I would also like them to change it back and I hope they do but I don't think they consider it bugged.
---
The one near the irradiated blocked train tunnel behind where you spawn in
---
Don‚Äôt you think that‚Äôs a bit heavy though? I carry 3 on me at most. I really only use my PA for fast traveling during my merchant runs 
---
Not sure why this got downvoted.  This game is in desperate need of more caps sinks.  I'd bet the legendary vendor will require a bunch of caps. 
---
It's one thing if it's a rare RNG drop, but when it's a once in a server (supposedly) drop, then scalping them just isn't fair and overall a dick move, which is the only reason why I give them away instead of selling
---
Hell yes
---
I wanna grow nuka weed and get trippy visuals. Is that so wrong?!?
---
Plot twist: that is how it is 
---
Wrong. 
---
Absolutely wrong
---
Op has to use the anti-greifing tools BEFORE she can cry "GrIeFInG". Block/server hop. 
---
If OP never server hopped. Its not griefing. 
---
Its only griefing if OP gets chased into a new server!
---
&gt;You are basically stealing loot from other players. 
---
Other players don't wait for me to tag mobs. I've never seen it happening in nuke zones. The only time someone waited for everyone to tag mobs was during Uranium fever. 
---
Besides that it's not stealing if i'm actually working for my loot.
---
&gt;Lower level players don't have even the change to shot the enemy once before it's dead
---
If it's with the Legendary sloth then i agree, if it's on a nuke zone i'll strongly disagree. People under level 50 have no business in nuke zones. I'm not going to babysit anyone through nuke zones.
---
&gt;If you have an explosive two shot auto weapon it will fuck with lower end PCs.
---
Well, it's not like an explosive weapon user knows your specs or is responsible for your FPS. Everyone is playing for their own enjoyment.
---
&gt;leading to a stuck enemy and nothing to loot
---
Easily fixable, just stab the corpse a few times
---
BTW, other than the supposed fps drop due to explosive weapons, all other points will apply to any other combo of perks/weapons. Your hate towards TSE weapons is misguided.
---
So if the game crashes while we have one or more chassis standing, we lose them?
---
That's fucked...
---
Without being able to rename, I have to drop 3 or 4 before I find the one I want to use
---
I'd throw my controller through the TV if I lost 4 at once

---
I stopped now. I'm just wondering what kinda bs allows a player to be immortal? Is there a perk or a legendary for it?
---
The M rated games rating might increase? 
---
The owl mask is probably the best of them.  People would probably want it the most if it was in the rare column.
---
It sounds like you dont want people to take a full advantage of their gear because....
---
1. Other people won't get some junk off low level enemies and you think they are "showing off". No one is showing off its just the best weapon to use and no one is going to miss a couple .38 rounds and a scrap of cloth.
---
2. Other people are a lower level? It makes the event go by faster and thata what the person with the TSE wants so probably not going to happen.
---
3. Other people's PCs aren't good enough? How is that anyone else's problem but the guy with the crap PC?
---
Not to sound hostile but the TSE guns rarly one shot anything other than trash mobs since the nerf and most of these points are someone else's problem, not the guys with explosive weapons.
---
...pretty sure OP wants both, and if one was included it‚Äôd be weird not to include the other.
---
i love the event for trading.  most times for me it seems everyone sticks around and trades after.  got some items i needed
---
Thats pretty cool!
---
I know what you mean but if they can show evidence that these rare masks are dropping then its not too much of an issue in my eyes, i know we havent seen any evidence but maybe people have been asking the wrong questions to Bethesda, instead of saying definitivly they are bugged, people need to ask for proof that they are dropping
---
Isn't there armor that had a chance of reviving you? 
---
Since the patch I have had my Gatling plasma get as many as 15 cores. (4530 rds)
---
no only need  3 charisma and rank 3 of animal friend  perk ...just finding one of the random spawn creatures is the hard part
---
You seem like you want the PvE servers from ARK.
---
This 100%.  I avoid non arranged trades because people get mad I won‚Äôt sell the gear off my back. 
---
Lol.
---
Miss Nanny* don't assume her gender. 
---
Nope, just max Animal friend.
---
PS4, I had uninstalled the game at one point but that shouldn't be the cause unless Bethesda are utterly useless in data storage (my save files were not deleted only game data).

Bloody mess. Whiskey, rum, beer and wine. You can run a murder church for all you like... But a lit cigarette? Hit the road, Jack.

Also, your level has to be at least 2x the animal you want to tame.

Never played ark. I dont mind pvp. But I dont want to be endlessly killed as I respawn back into the world, where he doesnt have to move and just spam attack as I load back in. Fuck me right?
---
It's almost like they thought people would use their mics. Who would a thunk it? Lol
---
What platform you on
---
PS4
---
Like a bug or you just don't have enough radaway?
---
I've been wondering that myself. 
---
Even for hostile creatures? (e.g mega sloth or deathclaw)
---
Never enough radaway
---
Never heard of it but it looks interesting. I'm good with Fallout 76. But I might try it out soon. Thanks for the info.
---
Did you clear your PS4's cache? Photos are stored locally and not on cloud.
---
The point is. that all of this. the game in its current state is because everyone wanted a non pvp mode and thats what they got. now to please the pvpers they are adding back in on the stuff that didn't please the non pvpers. its not new content thus its not a dlc. a dlc is defined by adding new or original content. And frankly saying pvp servers are a new mode is wrong.
---
I agree! I constantly find myself building outside, then go to transfer inside and have to back out, open the door and start er up again. It sucks lol. 
---
Xbox player here and that‚Äôs a big nope üò¢
---
It would be cool for the devs to add in ghillie suits to go hunting. I like the hunting aspect of the game a lot and would like to see some of the traps to catch the animals.
---
I just think its because theres no positive effects they could assign them, and the characters dont act out eating or drinking so you would literally just be poisoning your character with no benefit. So it should be pointless to waste time creating it.  Unless you just mean an emote in which case theres no shooting up or pill popping emotes either
---
Exactly lol
---
Farm Whitesprings for legendaries. You'll get tons of rad-x and radaway.
---
And they still work when you access playlists on another device?
---
Is it content? Do you download it? Boom DLC
---
Does animal friend work with deathclaw? (I already maxed out whisperers thinking was the right perk).
---
I like the concept but sometimes it would be awesome to have you camp stationary at times and have a tent for portability.
---
I fast travel everywhere, have 10k caps.  I don't do anything special, just don't buy a bunch of stuff, I usually only buy plans, have gotten a couple guns and armor off the marketplace though.  Sell all the assault rifles and usually clear a few vendors of caps a day, not even all of them. 
---
There are some legendary armors that can revive you if you are downed. Also he could have the mysterious saviour perk.
---
There's perk in endurance that can help relieve rads during certain hours. Also one that will give you more rad resistance. I love my rads though. 
---
Aight then
---
Ha ha! Genius
---
A quest appears to go to the station. A robot there guides you through a long series of quests to repair the station along with worker bots you build. One quest goes to an Enclave secret bunker to retrieve a prototype antigravity drive. This allows you to launch the station back in the orbit, and at the end of the quest, the official trailer for Starfield starts to play.
---
Yes, any tameable animal.
---
How can you do that many jetpack bursts in a row? I‚Äòm out of AP after my third burst, 4 bursts max. 
---
Just wait 3 days for survival mode. It'll be a free for all kill-fest.
---
Or allow the emoji communication while trading. Great point OP
---
I like the hunger reduction idea! I was thinking they could steady your hands, but the game doesn't have much weapon sway. Temporary flat boost to weapon / VATS accuracy? 
---
is it TSE or BE, because TS and bloodied are the same effect line and cannot be on the same weapon
---
also my main weapon is ts, reload, and vats, dont see why id complain about a explosive nerf...
---
I can hook you up i have a bloody build i dont need radway its tougher the lower your level then they start popping up like crazy. I wont be online for a few hours but my PSN is The_Stoney_Vibes
---
rad away and rad x and some x-01 power armour my bro 
---
I just put them up for 25k when they are requested. People get the message 
---
The bird bones give you enough lift that you glide while you get a little AP back. So you keep using it as you get it back. Over and over. 
---
It would be nice if there was an event that allows you to repair them and get rid of the risk of lung disease in the ash heap for the whole server, it would add a buff that increases disease resistance to lung disease 
---
If it‚Äôs just ammo couldn‚Äôt he have bought it? He also included the theory that the way the game counts is based only on what you acquire, did they refute that?
---
Thought about it but he doesn't even seem to to down to be rezzed . He just stays there and soak all the damage I dish and shoots me when he gets bored 
---
Imagine having to go through 40 to find a set of 45 excavator..
---
My xbox would be out the window if a crash took them from me like this
---
So what's the sense of a lvl 50 perk card like wasteland whisperers??
---
If someone contests your workshop, which is an intended PvP zone, they should be able to destroy things. Otherwise, nothing stops them from barricading, camping, and over-fortifying defenses with turrets. If you don‚Äôt like PvP, that‚Äôs fine, but workshops are PvP zones by design. They reiterated that in patch 6‚Äôs notes and it will remain when we switch over to adventure mode.
---
Pretty much
---
You had me at ‚Äúgo sweep water while it rains‚Äù. 
---
And instead of stimpacks, we‚Äôll just use bottles of ibuprofen. 50% chance of not healing any damage. 
---
Nobody gets anything. The turrets kill enemies and nobody gets loot. Not even the owner. 
---
About an hour I believe 
---
I am missing pistol shots as well, it almost feels like the vats bug they fixed is back 
---
It would be awesome if they did that! 
---
Especially the bear traps or snares when catching live game. They need to bring some elements from Fallout 4 back into the game.
---
18 DR I believe. 
---
You dont have to be killed that way. Here are your options:
---
1. (The Manlies Way) create a build where this cant happen to you.
---
2. (The Smart Way) Respawn somewhere else and then comeback and get the jump on him.
---
3.(The Most Common Way) Spawn anywhere else and ignore him.
---
You didnt have to keep respawning there ot seeking revenge for that matter. I myself have never had this issue though so I cant speak to how you were getting killed before you even loaded in.
---
/r/Market76
---
Yeah but there won't be fast travel and you wont see others on the map.
---
Is it anymore? I thought all the kids were vaping. I have a friend that teaches kindergarten, thankfully no problems there, but she's had to go to inservices about it because it's an issue in the school district. 
---
Or maybe it's just because teachers know what to look for with cigs but not vapes. A pack of Marlboros is pretty recognizable but some of these vapes look like a thumb drive.
---
But I've seen it reach 0 few times right after each other. Either the perk/legendary combo is broken or there was an exploit of some sort.
---
Nope you can hoard power armor, maybe someone beat you to them (: 
---
Game clip of it being rewarded to them. Unnecessary imo, but if that's not enough then it's a lost cause. 
---
lol, wonder if the new toy truck is as well. You all know the one.
---
Try server hopping that usually works for me the enclave missions did that for me and my buddies
---
So far there is no proof of anyone getting any of the 5 rare masks. We do know some people stole them from the dev room though.  
---
I don't wanna kill players for personal gain. That's just nasty.
---
Thats why I only take pure, healthy, psycho.
---
They don‚Äôt care. They feel entitled to exemption from PvP at an explicitly PvP zone. 
---
Let‚Äôs soak up some downvotes 
---
If you have one, i would like to buy it. My psn: Chlebostrom
---
That's what I was thinking of too. Just travel around and don't fast travel to make the game stretch out even more. People need to take out some things to make it more challenging but only by setting it as an alternate mode. 
---
I just beat the main quest without putting my C.A.M.P. down ever and had more resources than ever. It was hard but fun. I used the workshops at times.
---
I have had a locker quest before where I had to open a locker for something but Idk how I stared it 
---
Any time I've tried trading people instantly try and get my TSE shotgun, and they completely lose interest when I don't sell it to them. Makes it impossible to actually trade with most people.
---
Upvote for venture brothers reference (my favorite scene haha)
---
I dont wanna kill other players for personal gain. That's just nasty.
---
I just think it‚Äôs so odd that visited such a great number of them and found literally nothing. Server hopping also doesn‚Äôt help.
---
All I want is a set of T-60 and Todd is toying with me 
---
Either he has a shit ton of stimpaks or there was server lag and your hits weren't registering. 
---
Not necessarily. There are some ideas that can help out but this also up to the community as a whole.
---
That same guy took mine and came for me a couple days ago, didn't go to well for him.
---
I thought about that but I guess I am just too impatient for that.
---
My main menu doesn't even have a background to it.
---
1 hour from start event, which means when the event ends, it's about 45-40 minutes.
---
The fun Nazis are back at it again
---
No, the noise is the flame going out and you extinguishing is.
---
The best party of a bounty is earning it though and just wrecking some unsuspecting player or their CAMP
---
Cool thanks, does server hopping work ?
---
yep, and even in this idea while they do have a CND, they don't expire instead they go from counting as fresh to counting as canned, loosing their bonuses when the CND goes down.  
---
Yea I am surprised there isn't a flood of complaining posts about it. My friends and I have done it quite a few times. Not as many as other but with 4 of us and none of us getting a single rare and having never seen one on another player I am very surprised. 
---
There was no server lag everything was fluid and hits registered on the enemy mutants and even lowered his health fine. His health didn't ramp up just popped into quarter health each time 
---
*sobs beside you*
---
Listen fella this ain‚Äôt an argument I wanna have right now.
---
That's good for you but doesn't solve my problem with the vendors always beeing broke.
---
There‚Äôs actually a way to decline trade offers and requests implying you want a higher price, not for sale, etc. 
---
Nah. The cricket on my shoulder says that's not cool.
---
Well now I need to know where this is. 
---
Did the skeleton have a brimmed hat on him by any chance?
---
Might come in the next patch player vending says you'll mark items for sale maybe you can make them not for sale as well.
---
Lag doesn't always register as stutters or frame drops. That said there could be something fishy going on, upto the extent of cheating as well.
---
Yes big time
---
I did like 8 in 2 hours yesterday. ( something like that)
---
What Platform? PC, PS, XB?
---
No how about you shut up and let the guy play the real legit way like he likes to and stop calling him out for not wanting to be a troll. You and others may be ok with playing the game ‚Äúwrong‚Äù and yes there is a wrong way to play this game but some of us aren‚Äôt. As to answer the question I like the prison then move on to west tech
---
Ehh I've had mine kick in twice in a row when someone claimed my bounty... I wonder if you have multiple items like that it makes it more likely to happen 
---
I loaded in one time after death thinking I'll just grab my stuff. Not even thinking he may have taken it. My 2nd respawn I just went back to camp. 
---
There's a few youtube videos on detailed guides on how to do it, but first, I'd go to TNT dome 7 just to see if the door is open yet. If it is, the plans should be there. Otherwise, you have to go through a very long and complex process which has the risk of the key not even spawning because somebody else already looted it. 
---
I think arbitrarily putting a bounty on yourself would be easy for people to exploit in groups though. They could just leave the group, stash all their loot and armor, and put a huge bounty on themselves
---
PC, and thank you! I add a detailed description of exactly how and where to find each stash on my list, so I needed to pinpoint it instead of just saying one was at Harper's Ferry in a train car somewhere, even though I knew it was. That train car was HOT, had to put on my rad suit to get near it, haha. Found all 3 now, and they are about to go on my list.
---
I have had an issue of picking up technical data and when I go to drop it off it's gone. I've also had to drop it from my inventory (which is odd because your not supposed to be able to once your in the brotherhood) and pick it back up then it works. And then sometimes no problem at all with it. 
---
That's nice! Thanks a lot!
---
I switched to a single shot pistol from my auto pistol due to vats nerfs. My AA black powder pistol has been missing a couple critical hits against players as well.
---
Oh, man! Wow! This is horrible!
---
&gt; Takes another bite.
---
???
---
His theory is just that... a theory...
---
Ah yes, "fuck Bethesda" for having an ultra rare set of items that is just a luck of the draw to get. You entitled child üòÇ

I was in the same boat as you. Always hurting for caps. I'm level 66 now, and for the past 10 levels or so, I find I just naturally hang around 1500 caps, and that's without being super diligent about hitting up vendors each day. 
---
I usually hit up white springs (the resort and train station) then Harper's ferry, as they are all fairly close and close to my camp. 
---
I don't think it's so much that, but I know that some places and countries will ban sale of certain games over rudimentary shit. Murder, drugs? Nah. Cigarettes? Ban it.
---
Actually i was spending useless drive time at work, sooo. And no, i havent experianced any bugs, especially since ive never personally found this clothing item. But you seem to not be capable of understanding what a bug is. This is a single oversight in the clothing system, ergo, its a bug, sorry youre wrong bucko.
---
Although it is indeed not THAT different, it's still technically a different item. I will say though that the difference between the ingame clown outfit and the clean one from the atom shop aren't that different, and the change from dirty to clean is fairly small with those outfits.
---
There's also the old miner's hat (not the hard hat version), and there is both a clean and dirty version ingame (not the atom store), and the clean one is certainty cleaner, but it still has a bit of the wear and tear from the dirty one, and the difference can only be seen up close.
---
Some items in regards to being clean or dirty have different degrees of. Some really aren't that dirty to begin with for example. There are also not that many clean items at all really.
---
Np happy hunting

But it is part of fallout new vegas in the real mode.  And fallout 4 was a peice of shit of a video game.
---
It‚Äôs all the same after 50
---
Explosive legendary is 20%. Demo expert adds 60%, turning that into 32%. Is a 12% damage boost to your primary weapon worth 5 points? Typically I‚Äôd say no, but if you are chasing max damage and have the points to spare, you do you. And if you use actual explosives at all, it‚Äôs worth it.
---
Mine do. Very easily. Nerfed or not. 
---
I didn't realize what effects those names were referring to and that they were not the names of the actual armor.  For instance I thought Sentinel Assassins was the actual name not Assassins with reduce damage while standing still. 
---
You could try out some Lead Lined Armor mods if you have learned them yet. I'm not sure off the top of my head, but I think they give decent radiation resists.
---
And a few perk cards in Endurance, one called Rad Resistant which can give you +10 Rad resists per level, up to 4 levels. 
---
But you must have seemed revenge if he killed you again.
---
I've been after the blue for weeks lol. Was beginning to think it doesn't exist so thanks for confirming.
---
Saw a 800 guy sometime ago, have proof
---
Also saw someone in their 1500 but sadly don't have any proof
---
Obviously both were reached through using various exploits

People already do that....

A well paced camp + vault 76 + a workshop can keep you trekking around the wasteland cheap and quick. 
---
I think so but I did remember a hat near to Skelton but I didn't look what hat is called or Ethan took the hat 
---
Just uninstalled the game, nothing more
---
Yeh, i agree that it is clearly a lazy oversight ergo a bug. Classic bethesda, itll either get fixed, orrr people will fix it when and if modded private servers come out . 
---
Ah I see, thanks!
---
They reset every 20h.
---
Woah
---
If you open up the FO76 install folder, you can make a shortcut straight to the .EXE. You‚Äôll have to sign in launching from that, so I have the normal shortcut that launches me straight in with my main account that‚Äôs logged in to the launcher, and right next to that I have a shortcut to the exe that I‚Äôll launch after my main is in game, log in with my alt, and join server,

Red Dead has cigarettes/cigars 
---
I still enjoy it when I want to just focus on certain things to try and get (was working on the fasnacht masks until I saw the rumors) but if I want to just have a chill experience I play fallout 4. Having npcs at least eventually start settling in the servers would be a game changer.
---
I did go in, I got as far as repairing the power core. I had just ran out of time to seal the leaks. Then I got disconnected and I said screw this for now. 
---
Buuut i havent. Not a single one. Most ive experienced is lag. But that was due to my own internet fucking up.
---
Im not against things like flash bangs or smoke grenades, but realistically, if this starts adding in "military features" it'll only annoy people like me and you who know how things are supposed to be done and how wrong they are in game then you have all the keyboard commandos who then try and explain to us how things are supposed to be done even though their only experience is video games
---
Strange. Photos should not have gone.
---
I feel you on the loot issue. But this is a dog eat dog world. If you didn‚Äôt make it around the corner to tag that enemy. Move one to the next one. 
---
The "Crashed" "Space Station" should turn out to be a \*movie set\*.
---
An uncontrolled entry into the Earth's atmosphere would take place at 25 -30 times the speed of sound and produce temperatures up to 1,600¬∞C (about 3,000¬∞F). That's... quite fast und quite hot.
---
Unless it was made of some super durable and super heat-resistant material, there's no way a large object like that would just fall to Earth and bury itself halfway into the ground while retaining its structural integrity and distinct shape.
---
No, I wasn't aware of vendor fractions. Thanks for clearing that up! I guess I should find all the vendors first. I wasn't even aware of the BoS and Enclave in this game.
---
And I always told myself that I won't buy screws but I am always so low on that and only that. The problem is this first come, first serve mentality that this game has. I guess I am just unlucky but I looked up all the hot spots for special parts and I am aware of the tagging feature  but it seems that somebody always gets to these places before I do.
---
I am on PS4. I'll add you when I am done with work. I am from germany so I hope we'll be able to catch up somehow.
---
I use the certified call grenades as smoke grenades.  3 indoors in a small space provides plenty of cover.
---
As a smoker I am offended this is not a feature of the game 
---
I bet not. Not many people with nothing to stand on want to argue a losing point. 
---
Or how this patch has straight up introduced alcohol that causes hallucinations, black outs, and you can wake up in some random area. To get rewards, you're encouraged to make 50 bottles of alcohol, or down 25 bottles of alcohol, but noooooooooo, smoking is the real threat, and we can't have any of that.
---
Get the Travel Agent Perk under Charisma. You pay 30% less caps when fast traveling.
---
I think most of the other comments have the rest covered. 
---
smoking Cigarettes would give no stat boost, only negative side effects. Probs make you drain AP faster, less time you can hold breath when aiming with scope, etc.
---
I heard of that but never actually saw it.
---
The only issue is its kinda glitchy and you cant place foundations up there so building is limited to non structure things like benches tables chairs ect...
---
There‚Äôs a reason all of your thoughts on this form of ‚Äúevidence‚Äù are downrated. The community disagrees with that logic.. ‚ÄúEvidence‚Äù in the form of heresay is just heresay.
---
Muling, free fast travel point, and if you level up a character on that account, you can share an extra perk card, plus you can put the Empath mutation on that character and give your main some damage reduction, and also take advantage of Strange in Numbers (and/or the 15% bonus xp in group card)
---
I got my alt banned for including his name. my bad. Anyways like I've said I've never experienced anything like this before be it with other players or enemies. the guy would just stand there and watch me try to lower his health below 0. This makes me really salty that I won't be playing the game for a while. 
---
What‚Äôs new from them? I played the event one time and got some dumb soldier mask. But look in the dumbass atom shop and there‚Äôs a cool mask referencing Journey to the Moon :| Had 0 desire to grind at all. Our time‚Äôs more valuable than this, Bethesda.
---
I've agreed since fo4 and back.  This is a world of disease and radiation and monsters.  Are you really worried about lung cancer when you're not even sure you'll make it through the week?  They always seemed like a good staple in the apocalypse.
---
+10% gun stability, -ap regen, be cool if you even had a hacking cough after getting up from bed after getting Well Rested.
---
There is proof they are dropping in the post I reference in the editorial section, another Reddit '76 user did a poll, netting about 1,200 individual responses for a combined completed event total of 9,300 and so far there is about (1) 100% confirmed drop, and (2) that people are debating as they were available from the DevRoom as I understand it.  
---
Assuming the 2 up for debate are legit drops, At best that's 2 Uncommons in 12,000 completed events and 1 Rare in the same 12,000 completions, making the drop rate less than 0.03% chance.    
---
Typically other similar games would make uncommons around a 2% or better chance and a rare about a 1% chance, and 1% is considered "very very difficult" but obtainable.
---
If the numbers are accurate it makes these masks, a purely cosmetic item, several factors harder to obtain....
---
Do u get killed a lot? Or does it work itself out with just one shoting everything?
---
Since the Enclave in the congressional bunker quickly lost contact with Raven Rock and the Presidential Rig after the war, they probably never got anything beyond the original prototype of X-01 armor. 
---
I use a deathclaw gauntlet and it works every time. Weird
---
It still rains inside camp houses, the rest have some sort of trigger box preventing rain from appearing inside it, so for complex interiors it has to be quite a mind boggling placement.
---
You also don‚Äôt have evidence to prove they are not from the dev room.  The difference is that we know that people had this stuff by the dev room glitch.  
---
Thanks, I wasn't aware of that. In that case, I guess I'll be buying Sekiro today!
---
Requires a new animation, mostly.
---
Just farm point pleasant,  highest level scorched I see there is like 6, so just set up there and server hop.
---
Pc
---
At the moment I can say there is no limit below 40 in stash. Total with walking around I have about 50ish during my parts runs. I find that it's most efficient to find a server that has all the spawns that you wanna check, then just stay in that server doing other things till they reset, with server hoping it usually takes me 10 servers to find fresh spawns
---
Great points!
---
Spot on about the 5 common masks as people are literally throwing them away now, considering the extras not worth the stash space they take up.
---
This just happened to me. I got a 2 shot 50 cal and it‚Äôs ok but not as great as I want.
---
Did the event complete successfully?
---
Oh yeh I‚Äôm stupidüòÇ. Makes sense now thx
---
Also perks man very helpful 
---
Good info, will write up and submit later, thanks again
---
And this would make it much easier to profit from it
---
You should be able to flip it in your build. Instead of adding the door from the inside, add it from the outside and it should fix the problem. 
---
I've always felt that if it's a download that is requred to play the game it should be called an update.  Stuff you have to pay for it's DLC
---
But I understand people call almost all of it DLC now...
---
Can't hurt to try, if the vendor actually has 0 caps, you won't be able to sell anything to it.
---
Add me to friends my tag is Lawhorn 
---
I say start hanging around a certain area and make it a trade zone! Always meet in the same place so everyone knows! 
---
Great, a Fallout New Vegas circlejerker. Fallout 4 was received pretty well, not sure what you think is wrong with it. 
---
I wonder then, if S.P.E.C.I.A.Luck is a factor in getting these masks then, like having 15 luck will increase your chances of getting them dramatically.  
---
I imagine most people do not have maxxed out luck so would have the tiny chance of getting a mask
---
Im with you on this. The way OP describes the TENT is how I use my CAMP already.
---
I have my buildings blueprinted. I deploy my base in a matter of seconds and place my camp in strategic areas based on what I'm working on. I use metal walls, artillery and rocket turrets, and am very ready for any fight.
---
The features described such as gasmask filters and the additional aid items seem like more of an intrusion to the game among anything else.
---
I do however like the idea of environmental traps. Maybe deployable turrets for combat would be awesome. Or setting up motion sensors that alert you if a player is near by. A scrambler for the CAMP could be useful too. Hides you and others from the map when close by.
---
I'm on ps4 and I've seen 1 guy with a jester mask. Ironically they didn't seem to know how to do the event.
---
I get where you are going at.
---
You picked up a key from a random mole miner.
---
While placing your door pay attention to the hinges, the doors open toward the side the hinges are on.
---
If I place a door wrong I'll store it and try again, turning it around until the hinges are on the correct side I want my door to open.
---
Ha!
---
Find a Tesla Rifle. Put autobarrel on it. Aim in the general direction of the enemy group. Shoot. Tag every single mob. Let the TSE folks kill all the enemies for you which you now tagged. You're welcome. 
---
After 50 tries and getting everything besides the 5 rare masks, I called it quits. Truthfully, I value the CAMP Decorations more anyway (Balloons!!).
---
I'd rather spend my time doing something I actually enjoy in another game, like Metro Exodus, or Sekiro. I'll just log back on to 76 at 8 PM to do Biv's quest.
---
Was it just a loot quest? 
---
Bro add me i have no xbox friends and i will help you build expanse and defense it
---
Why ask a question if you‚Äôre just going to argue with everyone?
---
Ask someone to build a decom shower in your camp. I am on PC otherwise, I would do it.
---
And if your on console
---
Ill take your word, thats insane!
---
what *kind* of robo drugs we talking about here
---
Infantile.  You wasted a ton of resources for the obviously high lvl owner to come click "repair".
---
I have a turret base there, and the guns are on a switch, players love it. 
---
People like having a full camp there, and they like how they can turn it on/off.
---
I don't see why it makes you all so ReeeEEEeee
---
If you want any chance of getting it, you need to post what platform you are on
---
Jesus
---
Yeah I mean Item wise, yeah by all means add in as much as possible, but as soon as they start making it "mil sim" it starts dragging the fun out of things
---
Im on xbox also looking for friends. All my irl dudes are on Playstation so if youre on this thread looking for xbox allies and discover OP is on PC, hit me up
---
Noice!
---
If you can show me the proof I can add it as an update on the post. I would really appreciate it!
---
Huh?
---
PS4 üòÇ
---
Not really. You would still be losing the caps when you got killed. It is exactly the same except I dont need to blow up 20+ workshops first.
---
He‚Äôs just here to put everyone else down.
---
we live in an inflation culture. The solution is always quantity over quality. People just want to see their scores go up, devoid of any other meaning. I imagine most who want this change have really good methods for getting metric tons of caps, while new or casual players would lag far behind, unable to trade for decent stuff or buy legendaries. 
---
just my theory on why people constantly reject the idea of good cap sinks.
---
Legendary power armor would make legendary armor worthless, there has to be some downside to using power armor.
---
While using the Advanced Conduits when I get to a door or wall I place a standard conduit wire connector on the pipe I'm trying to place, then use the wall pass thru piece with the connector facing in.
---
Wire them both together and continue laying pipe on the other side with the pass-thru piece.
---
My thought too.
---
Well the first thing is it's a great fast travel, with a Whitesprings base and vault 76, you can get to anywhere on the map for &lt; 30 caps. 
---
Sure! My GT is BelgianBeerLuvr add me. I‚Äôm probably gonna launch a nuke at some point today or tonight. 
---
Make sure you use Contractor perk as well, reduces construction costs by half 
---
Speaking of space outfits.. 
---
I didn't know there were different levels of them. When I was a noob I got a level 10 at the Nuke plant. Yesterday I was where the miners live forget the name, bottom left of the map. In the back of a pickup I found a level 25! Dropped the 10 right there. 
---
I agree the space station is one of the coolest spectacles of the game. When I first saw it my mouth dropped lol üòÅ
---
And to think I have it all memorized lol
---
I‚Äôve heard from others it does. Haven‚Äôt personally verified yet. 
---
Just go to whitesprings, I'd wager my money on that being THE PvP location in the game
---
Nobody. Just another player, asking a bit of kindness for other players. I'm not talking about the Scorchbeast Queen, since it has so much hp and is mostly a high level event, i'm talking about other events.
---
I just want a fat cigar
---
Drugs are in the game because they give you abilities. What would cigs do
---
I like the idea but I dont think it should be added until there's a way to tell chassis apart from each other. With how it currently works I dont think the chassis would even have a star to show the legendary part is attached while its in inventory
---
You should be able to walk through items that you're currently moving around, like fo4. It would have made a lot of things much easier. 
---
Apocalypse date spots
---
Was on this guy‚Äôs side until reading the comments. Yikes! What an unhappy, condescending being. Hope you can find peace in the world from something other than criticizing others for what they enjoy.
---
Batteries Included makes them trivial. I live in my power armor. I don't even carry regular armor with me My primary weapon is a Gauss Rifle, so I'd be running the perk regardless. I'm actually carrying like 33 of them, but I only have 10 left from the last time I captured a workshop with a fusion core processor. The rest are at varying levels of charge. 
---
If you uninstall the game, or rebuild your database, or anything like that, you will lose your photo gallery.
---
As others mentioned, the game kinda keeps Photos in your cache for whatever reason. Even if they're still on your PS4 (Check your Capture Gallery), the game can't pull from there.
---
I know there‚Äôs some terminal lore about them. Hornwright wanted to use them to collect the resources they wasted on mining by pulling them out of the air. Eventually it got more efficient to just make the whole refining process to spit out more ash and smoke
---
Please don‚Äôt tell MODUS I‚Äôm giving the Brotherhood technological secrets 
---
It happened to me when I moved from a regular xbox one to an xbox one x. 
---
Fallout new Vegas had this feature as well, with Boone‚Äôs spotter perk it outlined enemies with a reddish glow. Same with Rex the mechanical doggo, he would put a greenish glow around containers that had food inside of them.  
---
Here are the seven different factions..save this 
---
Considering that weapon mods that increase hipfire accuracy help VATS, I‚Äôm pretty sure vats is considered hipfire (ie not aimed)
---
It only doesn't work when the perk isn't maxed out, and it has to be a melee.
---
Ah ok, makes sense then 
---
Not if it costs money to place the bounty up front, so you cant place a bounty if you dont have that many caps that get removed from you immediately
---
Adults, lol. 
---
Blackbird has to be the best paint job so far. Sadly we only have one paint job for the excavator PA. 
---
It's a known and "marked" location on the map provided with the official Prima guide for the game. As it stands I believe it's just there as flavor.
---
I never cared
---
Ah, got it.
---
So much yes. The pickup timers aren't long enough for me to take pictures anymore
---
There a YouTube on it it‚Äôs 4 minutes long
---
Funny you should say that. The way I see it Legendary Armor makes Power Armor totally worthless. 
---
I need skins for gatling lasers, gatling guns, 50 cal and a Tesla Rifle... üò≠
---
Because I asked a question that required a simple answer and was instead attacked. Those that gave meaningful answers were responded to in kind
---
Oh dang, this is very helpful. Thanks!!
---
it has to be a random spawn, it cant be a static spawn, like power station next to watoga deathclaw you cant tame him and send him to your camp, or like the hermit crab near dabney thats always on the highway, cant tame him and send him to your camp either.
---
Well, going around post history just to prove that i often complain about things i find bothering is not a good thing to do.
---
The Fashnocht event is THE PvP spot at the moment.
---
I didn't think of testing with Awareness perk card. Thank you for reminding me it exists
---
Even if you just come by and loot meat piles and paper bags!
---
I don't even bother with keeping 1 stars anymore. 
---
This is why I play solo. When I play with other people, I inevitably rush through locations and miss things like this.
---
I check all the vendors daily but they are never there. I'm currently on a mission to find Graham to see if he has them but I've been searching forever too. 
---
You forgot about shooting up 
---
Lol. What? 
---
Legendary Player system isn't until end of the year iirc.
---
Brick plans are at Watoga vendor. May need 2-3 server hops, but it's there.
---
Is that to say that health modifiers etc doesn't change? 
---
For example: a level 200 can have a fair fight with a level 400?
---
Psycho- BUFF ftfy
---
The thing is, when the game launched, I'm pretty sure it had the longest list of licensed songs to date, but a few weeks in, it seemed like half of them got removed.
---
Yea, Batteries Included+Power User+Full Charge is a power armor users dream. Cores weigh next to nothing and last a long damn time. 
---
they could make it where you get a bounty for killing security bots
---
Awesome, im kinda new to the game so i apologize if im not as helpful right now but i will get buff soon. Im KingMonkeyDevil on xbox and ill add you as soon as i get back to my console. I have like 1 piece of the code for alpha and 2 for bravo but idk how helpful that is
---
I meant Harper's Ferry, but same comment applies.
---
As an occasional pipe and cigar smoker in real life, I definitely think this should be added to the game. 
---
Definitely an issue that already needs to be addressed anyway.
---
Yeah, that's, uh, not what we do here.
---
I'm not on now but I did a thorough sweep of  Morgantown - do you have all of those? There are 10 locations :)
---
Seen the brick building set at pleasant valley station fairly often. I'd check there a couple more times.
---
You're here too pal.
---
Which will have ended by time the PvP mode came out
---
Demo perk on an explosive weapon turns it from 20% more to 32% more. 12% damage worth 5 perks? Your call
---
Well I assume as you can write English you can speak it so hopefully language should be a problem. 
---
Tour only 2 hours ahead of me in the UK so that's shouldn't be a problem.
---
I will be on at about 9pm so that's 11pm in Germany 
---
Haha. Everyone would be wanted all the time.
---
If you are looking for PvP, why bother with all that. When I am in the mood, I just look for that person with more than 2 workshops going. Having a workshop opens you to legit PvP, but more than one Workshop is the invite to get smacked. 
---
Yep.
---
I checked every vendor including Harper's Ferry every day for 10 days before I threw in the towel. It's there for everyone else except me apparently. 
---
You need a second console. 
---
Why are you giving wastelanders plans, you are enclave. 
---
Yh pretty much 
---
I have fought 4 mythical Flatwoods monsters in the last two days, one spawned in whitespring near my camp and I've come across several different mothmen (stalking, vengeful, normal, and wise)
---
I love the cryptids in this game And I love the Mothman of WV, I can't wait to hunt Sheepsquatch‚Ñ¢
---
I do that too but sometimes I want to PvP at my camp.
---
It's gone from the games 50 stored but theyre on the console. The game doesn't remember them since it was uninstalled
---
Oh my goodness, I had no idea junk tagging was a feature on this game! That will come in handy soo much, thank you!
---
Wait til you get a TSE, it does good dps
---
Meant to change it to Brotherhood like a week ago
---
You guys like math, what's the odds on never seeing a mask?
---
Was there anyone in power armor near by? That seems to be causing something to that effect recently. Usually running on the spot too so I figure lag related?
---
I have been told that there is a better than good chance he comes after you if you take his eggs from point pleasant, near the Mothman statue.
---
Yeah, and all that complaining is bad for your mental health. Take a break if something about a game bothers you so much
---
Well I can will they drop modded guns tho cus there only level 6
---
I was thinking they could do something like each year, make the rare make from the previous year be the common ones, and add some new rare ones, and the common ones from the previous year would be retired.
---
yes doesnt matter
---
technically its just the base game which means your not downloading it. its more like a update. a dlc adds in new content that is not part of the base game.
---
Whats it smell like?
---
I‚Äôve wasted dozens of shots on 95% in VATS. Makes the weapon almost unplayable, and I just wanna role play being a cop from the future
---
&gt; If millions of people are still playing this game  
---
I don't think millions of people are playing the game to be honest.

---
Prior court cases is likely the reason.  Smokes and such have been sued into oblivion for use in popular media.  Marlboro got the shit sued out of them for listing some things as Lights and Ultra Lights, and was perceived as those types being 'less bad' for the smoker.  Camel got sued about Joe Camel, etc.  Bethesda likely didn't allow smoking just to avoid the issue entirely.
---
I have 4, all outdoors. From my list:  
---
Vault-Tec University. In the little student protest tent camp just to the North East of Vault-Tec U. Inside the large green central army tent on a wooden school desk.
---
In the rear of a bus, directly east of the back door to Vault Tech University a stash can be found beneath a seat occupied by a skeleton holding a bouquet of flowers.
---
On the roof of Big Al's Tatoo Parlor (Just added by the Nukashine DLC).
---
Morgantown High School. Upstairs in the South West corner room, with the black-and -white checkered floor. The stash is in a small blue plastic crate by the chalk board.
---
Morgantown Train Yard, on the ground floor of the largest building, in the corner nearest to the huge observation tower, on the bottom shelf of a small white painted metal roller table.
---
Guess I have more to add, haha.
---
I found it kind of away from the fast travel point in lockers by a bench. Look for another post I made with the specific location
---
I haven't repaired my guns in a long time yes it works ps4 btw
---
I think it has!!
---
Hopefully not as many people are trying to get it. There‚Äôs only one key per server so you may have to do it a few times.
---
I just don't know what the benefits would be. Alcohol makes somewhat sense to have some benefits, pills make the most sense (from the prospective of the junkie, they are stronger faster and can't be taken down easy) I just dont see any what they could add to smoking to make it worth it. I'd personally like to smoke some nuka-weed though so let's figure this shit out 
---
And i give it. I give people plenty chance to tag other things before i shred. TSE got nerfed into the ground multiple patches ago. It's not our fault RNG hates you or you don't know how to use molotovs when farming whitespring.
---
TSE is a complete non-issue compared to the bloodied meta, the lack of dev communication, and the poor network health of the game.
---
Stop grasping for attention
---
I'm done with it..have all the common masks 
---
Are you talking about that green/teal pop out tent?
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox as well what lvl are you :)
---
Would be cruel to add to 76. You've no canned food, no disease cures, parasites. Here doggy doggy...
---
&gt;Thanks, those are all on my list. ;)
---
You can smoke in Red Dead Redemption 2!
---
I agree. I want to smoke on my character.
---
Your make believe etiquette will not stop me or prevent me from playing the way I want to play.
---
 Killing a enemy is NOT stealing from another player.
---
For the record I don't own a 2 shot explosive anything. 
---
Loot whitesprings. Specifically the managers office. 
---
 This is really how you want Bethesda to spend their time? Not me.
---
Mandatory perk right there.  
---
Reddit is a small minority of players, yes its true the world doesnt revolve around reddit and most gamers don't bother visiting any sort of forums at all.  Why do people need to prove the items came from the event?  Wasn't a scan done a few patches ago that banned anyone with items from the dev room?
---
Exactly why I haven't played in months now. It got super frustrating. 
---
Oh I like the VATS accuracy increase that would make sense. 
---
My favourite story moment has to be the unknown fate of Kelly and Anya. No spoilers on them or their tapes. 
---
I will. Thank you good sir.
---
I posted this same thing a couple months ago, apparently EU has regulations against smoking in media so it wouldn't fly in most of Europe.
---
I'm on PC, level 42 but I always enjoy playing with others! Add me, my in game name is fight-milk :)
---
15 right now but i promise ill be super buff once  i discover the optimal path to leveling. 
---
The save files are online, no?. You could log in from anywhere and your progress is saved.
---
You're asking for stuff that's a bit uncharacteristic for the time. Flashbangs were more in common use in the 70's. Night vision scopes have a really long history so it makes sense we have those, but NV goggles are pretty recent (if the 90's are considered recent). 
---
The things you're describing sounds like you want this game to be more like a traditional FPS, which I don't think Fallout needs to emulate. I did my time in the military and I'm more into the game standing on its own with it's unique character and aesthetic.
---
No. Just no.
---
 Grinding for anything is tedious.
---
Just bought for 1100 caps. If you want, join my server and I'll sell to you for what I paid. GT: jacobvl
---
That reminded me of a drawing done of a family in Fallout.  A mother and daughter are sleeping with a ghoul having approached them.  The mother is pretending to be asleep while slowly reaching for her gun while the ghoul reaches for her still sleeping daughter.  Then you see that the ghoul almost looks sad while looking at the little girl.  Then you notice it‚Äôs wearing a faded dress.  Then you notice the little silver locked around it‚Äôs neck with the small face inside.  Ghouls sometimes still remember things that are important to them.  That‚Äôs why they carry the items that they do and why they congregate in specific areas

---
I do the same with my chassis and pieces. Just yesterday I had 3 being loaded with pieces above my level and they still automatically stored with no crash. Xbox.
---
I was just trying to use some of my 60 pounds of gauss rifle ammo since i needed that storage space. It's a pain in the butt currently
---
perception -2 is good. but i would replace the -1 intelligence with -1 endurance. 
---
No, Bethesda can‚Äôt do that. Bethesda came forward and said they don‚Äôt have item ID therefor if they went through to scan X accounts that had Y ID, they couldn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs why they have such trouble banning dupers. This basically means the only way to track items is by looking over a selected accounts intake of items. (Read the article about the 900 hour guy.) so right now there‚Äôs no real evidence, screenshot or video, of someone actually getting the reward and it‚Äôs super not encouraging. 
---
 I seldom bother. There's not enough in there to get me to equip my perks. How do I know this? ;)
---
Are you also pounding any AP regen meds?  What about other PA add-ons?
---
We have gas masks already. The suggestion is to make a more grindy/farmy mechanic in a game that's already quite grindy/farmy. I can't be the only person that thinks we need less of that
---
Landing wasn‚Äôt as smooth as could be but brought some sweet tunes back with us 
---
It would be too much. People are busted as is. What we need is more speciality PA. 
---
Fitting with the lore. Let‚Äôs see sentrybot PA. Armed with either a minigun or missile launcher. That rolls on tank treads. 
---
At this point I would be willing to buy T-60 off of someone. This is ridiculous. I‚Äôm also looking for a T-51 left arm, but since I‚Äôve found literally no chassis, I also haven‚Äôt found that single part.
---
Thanks again
---
I forget the real name for it but the Fallout 4 mod that let you save after a brief smoking animation was top notch for my survival playthroughs. It would be a great system to implement for 76‚Äôs gameplay!
---
Example Smoking Animation=30 seconds.
---
Clearing the entire animation without moving or being attacked for +2 Luck&amp;+2_______ with like +5% xp!
---
10-20seconds maybe +1 Luck and nothing else?
---
Just backs up that people who smoke feel like it helps them get the job done, etc. or else why are all of these people getting extra breaks in real life?!
---
Wow. 
---
If my friends aren‚Äôt on I can run whitesprings a couple of times with you. I‚Äôm only lvl 50 tho
---
I could really use another boost to stash weight.  1000 lbs would help immensely in storing legendaries. 
---
Rip ok
---
Single parts are the bane of my existence.. What system u on?
---
 I hunt em' for sport and my Instigating Lever Action brings em' down and my knives finish them. 
---
 No serious weaponry required. ;)
---
So just 1 perk gives 20% and 5 gives 32%? Am I understanding that?
---
So you dont think that there is anyway to balance this? Busted guns calls for busted armor.
---
It'd just be cool if they gave wood armor a ghillie skin
---
I've had some issues with the nukes "teleporting" back to me. Fired at enemies below my position from up on a cliff - I watched the mini-nukes land over where the enemies were but the explosion spawned at my feet and I died, whereas the enemies were fine. The MIRV seems to have issues with firing at any sort of decline. When firing level or up (outdoors) I've had no problem.
---
I do this to differentiate my T-60 from my excavator. One has the atomic shop icon from being painted, the other is default frame.
---
Well dang. If u were xbox I would have just given you any parts you needed for free

VATS accuracy boost, CH boost, AP decrease, temporary +5%/10% hunger (but lose 10%/15% when it wears off), LK boost (Lucky Brand cigarettes was a mod for 3 or NV), etc. 
---
Any combination of those things, but obviously not overpowered. 
---
I literally collect all the cigarettes i find just to rp that i smoke. I really wish they would add smoking into the game for real. You can literally drink an alcoholic drink that makes you black out and land somewhere else but can‚Äôt smoke like what 
---
Bet 
---
Maybe I've just had very unlucky timing with random crashes then.
---
I remember that pic from 3 years ago.
---
There is a similar note in FO4 when a child and a parent lock themselves up because their relative has turned feral
---
While I sympathize for OP. This reply sums up my feelings exactly.
---
Sounds like some pretty solid burn out. Nothing wrong with taking a break for a bit and playing something else. Come back refreshed in a few days / weeks. Nothing wrong with that.
---
No point driving yourself into the ground. 
---
Yeah they could add ghillie suits, or there's Stealth Boys and Chameleon legendary armour that aren't that rare. But then again it probably wouldn't be too hard to make a ghillie suit and have it as an outfit
---
I mean in FO4 npcs could smoke, so why can't we use them as an aid item for better aim or something like that?
---
When you don't want workshops anymore, immediately change worlds before you go back to your camp. When you do own a workshop never head to your camp and avoid carrying any significant junk you don't want to lose.
---
You dont gotta do that, but ill definetly assist once im up there in levels. Always good to know more people, my tag is KingMonkeyDevil 
---
Dunno why they do it but I kinda like how it works - if I'm in an area with other players and I hear a Super Mutant yelling "Run away!" in the background, I know there's a Legendary over there and I should disengage from my current fight to go track him down.
---
I‚Äôd love if this was a thing maybe even weed or something do that nuka shine Like effect 
---
I'd be down for a ruined super-duper mart that players can plop a vending terminal down in
---
I had a shit ton I was about to drop when the RNG gods saw fit to gift me with an instigating gauss
---
Call me crazy but I think that‚Äôs totally ok. 
---
Most people inherently know that chopping someone in half with an axe is bad. But to kids cigarettes don‚Äôt *seem* bad. 
---
That‚Äôs why we still have such a smoking epidemic throughout the world even though, at least in the US, there are no smoking ads everywhere. 
---
We absolutely shouldn‚Äôt be encouraging kids, or anyone, to smoke. It‚Äôs disgusting. 
---
Maybe 1/100,000,000 kids will saw someone in half with the chainsaw gun from Gears, but smoking kills 50% of its purchasers. I‚Äôd rather my small children (when I have them) play violent video games than watch someone smoke and think that might be cool. 
---
Mines DAPANDA280. Good luck
---
Items have IDs, they just arent unique, they absolutely could scan for items that weren't meant to be obtainable and ban for it.  Point is why do you need evidence? do you think everyone that gets a mask is going to screenshot it and put it here for your proof?  You would probably just claim photoshopped, stop being rediculous.
---
Oh my god I must‚Äôve missed where this was discussed. I tried using it twice and died both times and assumed all fatmans were bugged since I never see anyone using them. So it‚Äôs just the daisycutter?
---
Are you making sure to try it on t51 and not ultracite? Both look the same but dont count as the same
---
We could use low light systems instead. The scopes in some weapons in the game are night scopes.
---
Flash bangs could be ommited out and we could use concussion grenades since they have been there for a good while.
---
The timeline was advance even the Helios one. They had holograms on table systems.
---
This hit me the other day, I hit the limit in the middle of my daily vendor run, I‚Äôve been doing that run daily, basically since beta. I hit the cap, and suddenly every item I sold I sold for free, the psychological change was pretty major.  I had no reason to sell, no reason to do the rounds, my usual path for he day was broken, I didn‚Äôt know what mission to do next, and even if I did another mission, it would just give me more stuff to give away free?   I turned off the game, Faustnaut helped give me something completely different to do, and obviously money was no object so I did it up!  
---
Please raise or remove the cap completely. 
---
For adventure, give us other kinds of leader boards. Most caps, longest without death, longest held a workshop, Nukes launched!!! SB and SBQ kills, etc give us other things to compete over other then killing eachother.  
---
You can use rugs as floors tho
---
I recall there was 1 legendary chest piece as a quest reward in FO4, so I guess it's not beyond the realm of possibility. Just a question of balance I suppose. 
---
You also need the Power Smith perk card equipped to mod advanced stuff for PA. I might be wrong but without it, those Calibrated Shocks won‚Äôt appear as available even if you have learned the plans. 
---
There are quite a few sneeky features. What level are you? And what console do you play on 
---
Don‚Äôt know if you got it resolved but I‚Äôve had trouble with their holotapes and terminals in FO76 quests. Try dropping all of the holotapes in your inventory and then picking them back up.
---
It‚Äôs a workaround for a different game bug but it might help you here.
---
Think of it like drinking moonshine as opposed to Bud lite your whole life. 
---
nah bruther mentats are just tiny books that you eat. it‚Äôs how they increase your intelligence 
---
That‚Äôs ‚ÄúBerry Mentats‚Äù for you sir. 
---
That is awesome!
---
It is indeed the armor one. It gives 3DR at the moment. It may give more when over-repaired, I am not sure as I do not have those perk cards as of yet.
---

---
Is that not the right way?  I've been locked in a hermetically sealed vault for 25 years, I forget.
---
The smoke effects that would follow would crash everybody's game.
---
.03 is hardly ultra super mega rare when you consider the event is run 1000s of time by multiple people.  You want rare drops but everyone is suppose to get them?  Come on...
---
I think it only does a check when you login, but you can rebuild, but there is no point, each time you login or maybe once a day is going to flag and remove your camp, you may as well go find another spot. Some people suggested it is a bug, so you may want to wait a while, not sure how long and see if they fix the area or zones. I have been evicted out of two my camps.
---
As mentioned the crazy damage will be bloodied builds. I've got a bloodied weapon on my commando but I only use it for the occasional lolz. I stick with being healthy and using a lot of crits rather than op damage. That being said I use an executioners handmade on normal runabouts which does 90ish damage which is more than enough for most things. Just shoot things in the head. I also use a two shot 10mm sub as spare. Not so vats friendly but good for a bit of spray 'n' pray, usually if in PA.
---
Oh I got a few tricks for it, thanks for the tip though.
---
No, my C.A.M.P layout is incredibly cramped, particularly on the first floor. The door was quite literally in my way as I was trying to move about in the open position, and when I closed it I‚Äôd need to run back and forth outside and inside as I connected the main buildings wiring to my other buildings like my Armor Shed and  Rocket turret batteries. 
---
We already have armour for that purpose. Unyielding, sentinel, assassins? 
---
Legendary PA won‚Äôt solve anything but add to the power curve.  
---
Man this isn‚Äôt one of those 2015 Illuminati confirmed videos. All I want it a clip of someone getting the mask from the event. You don‚Äôt know me at all so quit trying to play dominant and tell me what I‚Äôll do. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ridiculous to see someone actually receiving the reward?? 
---
I think it‚Äôs even funnier there are legendary scorched that do the same thing, but they don‚Äôt yell, and they blend in better so you just never see them!   I think they might start to run as soon as you spawn in.  I found one once in Harper‚Äôs ferry and had to chase him very far away before I could catch and kill him 
---
To whit whomst would debate me, an intellectual.
---
Instigating gauss... damn, I envy you
---
i'll try it again, but they are nowhere near my Camp unit at all.  like I said, they never even make it within my green circle for more than a second before teleporting hundreds of feet away
---
I personally wish they‚Äôd add a radio announcer. I think it‚Äôd make the Wasteland a little less lonely for people who always travel alone. 
---
No I remove them to save space because they were on the game. Because most games (like gta v for example) are coded well enough to have propper storage for these things.
---
You're a bit misdirected. The knuckle daggers are the Non Meta folks showing up at AWOL armaments or SBQ. They're chewing up my stimpacks when I have to keep reviving them, or my ammo as the queen health scales.
---
Doesn't really have much function other than visual smoke though, I'd think a properly implemented smoke grenade would lower the accuracy of Vats and whatever the enemy targeting system is, through the smoke
---
No vanilla x01, I should probably take a look at some improvements.
---
But you uninstalled 
---
Where is Copland's Apalachian Spring?

Or go to one of the many showers around the map. Mines or waste dumps tend to have them.

https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/youth_data/movies/index.htm

If smoking in movies can influence young people to start smoking I'd wager doing it in videogames isn't much different. There's a big gap between the taboo act of violence and generally acceptable act of smoking
---
It's also not by the same company. In the end it's up to Bethesda on if they're adding it or not.

Where did you find the game on sale? Been holding off since beta as i had a poor experience, but with the new updates and survival mode i'm looking to give it another try

You don‚Äôt need walls, and if you want them use shelves

I lavo my forest‚Äôs CAMP..

Haha now I'm imagining someone sprinting while hacking darts lol

And roofs?

I thought the same, but when I put on level 3 lockpicking perk cards, I found that sometimes the high level safes have plans. End game for me is basically plan-hunting, lol.
---
I'll make sure it's not too military. But to the point it gives a survival like feel for the wasteland.
---
What is the current range? 
---
Maybe. The only crashes I really ever see are within 5 minutes of a server hop I've noticed.
---
0.03% is 1 in 3000. So out of 3000 runs youll get a single mask of 5 possible.
---
That is more than rare.
---
Its not a matter of everyone getting them, its a matter of Anybody getting them. With such a rare drop chance even if you farmed 24/7 for the week of the event you would only get up to 500 runs, and still likely not get a mask.
---
I'm about to hit level 30 and I mainly play it on the xbox. (I also have it on PC.)
---
Kinda like the robo brains and make it where you can't see at all. I like vats being lowered and the same for perception.
---
Ok thanks mate
---
&gt;The scopes in some weapons in the game are night scopes.
---
And night vision scopes and weapon attachments go as far back as WW2 and the korean war. Goggles are something else entirely. 
---
Regardless, I think all of this goes by the way side when you consider we already have something in game that accomplishes 90% of what you're asking for. Berry mentats and the night eyes perk help with vis. The cryolator and cryo explosives decrease vis and slow enemies. There's already gas masks, but it'd be nice if we didn't add another grindy element to an already grindy game.

This, but OP deserves absolutely No sympathy for throwing a pointless bitchfit and trying to force his own code on us. That never goes well (look at for honour, where 2v2 has basically become two 1v1s on the same map because apparently brawling (as is the mode's namesake) is dishonourable.). Nobody will agree on how to have fun, but most people will not try and force their idea of fun on you.

RDR2 seems to be the most open game about smoking where you actually get to see the character do it and make him do it. So maybe it‚Äôs not as big of a deal anymore. Likely the reason it‚Äôs not in FO76 is because it would require a new animation that wasn‚Äôt in FO4.
---
This post shouldn't be getting down voted, I think it's the best reasoning over heard about this issue.
---
I‚Äôll keep that in mind!
---
Umm.. Surprised nobody has told you, but plans are static now. No more random chances, the vendors that are supposed to have them always have them now.
---
im in agrement, imo it needs to be doubled and that would be fine.  id keep the cooldown as is because its already at 15 minutes and there is a long delay between smoke and firing.

Definitely. The Concrete structures from FO4 really need to be implemented, with diagonal ramp-walls for proper outside style. Ideally, we could make proper ground terrain as roofs and ramps like the bunkers at Hidden Valley in New Vegas. Fuck, ideally, we could make underground bases. That'd be incredible. Like 7 Days To Die. I made do badass bunkers in that game
---
One of my characters has a 15 luck, second a 9 luck, last two have a 3 and 1 respectively.  
---
Atleast for me, it's made no difference.
---
Then you're making the argument chems or alcohol shouldn't be in the game.
---
When it's not maxed out? Weird but I'll try it next time!
---
[MORE RUG!?!?!](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5c/c5/cb/5cc5cbf9ceadc3e97bcbca3cad031c84.jpg)
---
Yes and have done so with multiple other games and not lost photos because they either store important things like this in cloud or save files so they are not lost. This method where data is lost is just sloppy.
---
I will never understand the corner of the fallout fandom that is obsessed with smoking.
---
Middle School cool.
---
No, I'm saying it *doesn't* work when it's *not* maxed out. Sorry if it sounded confusing.
---
Show me ONE person, with proof, who has them. Nobody has one.
---
No, they're bugged. 
---
Sure, that wouldn‚Äôt change the game for me in the least. 
---
Not a single verified drop on an entire platform goes beyond any logical intention for an event oh sycophantic one. 
---
[Data Expunged]

Stop smoking it‚Äôs disgusting

*shoots up 5th psychobuff of the hour*

Roughly how many times have you done the event with your 15 luck guy?

While it makes sense, there might be some issues with certain countries. I remember one of the chems is straight up morphine, but they had to rename it because I think Australia had an issue with it? Plus the chems are nonspecific enough to seem "made up" (or just not actually called what drug they are, they're not even referred to as drugs). You can scroll through [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1hae3j/what_real_life_drugs_are_the_chems_in_fallout/) for some ideas of what they are.
---
Beyond that, it's probably too much of a hassle to code an item as both junk and aid without introducing some convoluted mechanic, like taking a cigarette to a work station and "crafting" it to be usable.
---
I believe they are sold as advanced power connectors. 
---
&gt;On the left side of the map it is the Responders...
---
Also, the station at Sutton is raiders, so even if you only have access to the the area right around v76, you still have at least two factions to sell to (3 if you manage to run into Graham).
---
I had it happen to me twice and lost some good memories with a guy I met in the game
---
The sped up video makes it look like you're gleefully dancing at the top. Which, TBH, I'd do as well if I managed that.
---
It doesn't make sense at all to go all-in with something like alcoholism or glorifying even harder drug use but arbitrarily be against tobacco/cigarettes. 
---
Just like the title of the post - you don't want your kids watching someone smoke a cig, but you're fine with them observing all other manner of drug use/abuse? 
---
I was seriously expecting to find scorchbeast poop an ingredient for a glow in the dark cocktail, ‚ÄúScorchy Suprise‚Äù maybe lol üòÇ 
---
Thank you. I work in construction and work around smokers all the time. Smokers aren‚Äôt bad people. Smoking is. 
---
Not a single smoker I know *DOESN‚ÄôT* realize how incredibly bad it is for them and the people around them. They do it mostly for stress. There‚Äôs better stress outlets out there. 
---
Does anyone here deny that smoking is undeniably bad for them? 
---
Ah great thankyou, where are they sold?
---
Did you complete the scorched earthwhen u hit prime?
---
Agree 100%
---
... no comment

It you haven't finished the brotherhood quest line, then technical data stacks properly. My friends and I all have characters that haven't done the brotherhood quest for this exact reason. Trade one technical data at a time to a character that can turn them in, bam, you can use hundreds of technical data.
---
We need underground bunkers badly. I remember the concrete walls and the hidden valley. Good times.
---
Near the vault is a lumber yard, i wanna say south west, it has an icon on the map. Other wise cruise the woods and grab it from logs.
---
Nuka Cola Quantum WAS shipped around before it's big release according to a few places (mentioned in 3 and Nuka World) so I assume they got ahold of an early batch and with WV having it's own Nuka Cola plant I'm sure there was a way for them to get ahold of it in a decent quantity
---
The brick one works, but, I feel like they have the switches on the wrong side. 
---
Power is on the outside brick wall and keypad is on the inside white wall. I had to build a 1 tile patio/recessed entrance to spin the wall around to get the key pad to face the outside of the building. 
---
Also you need to build an exit door somewhere else because the interior switch itself cannot be activated to leave the house. 
---
You know you are hopelessly addicted when you sink to complaining about not being able to smoke in a game.
---
That's illegal.
---
Yeah this is the reason. Smoking in games isn‚Äôt a big deal for moral reasons any more, no one gives a shit about that. Look at RDR2, full blown detailed smoking mechanic in that game. There‚Äôs just not many other games that go to the lengths that rockstar does to add those details. Even if you could smoke in Fallout you wouldn‚Äôt see an animation for it. It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs an animation your character does when taking other chems.
---
No. 1 secondary legendary effect (‚Äúexplosive‚Äù) adds 20% explosive damage to a gun‚Äôs base damage. 5 perks (Demo Expert) turn that 20% to 32%, for a total increase of 12% of base damage for 5 perk points 
---
Bump?
---
Nope, never said that. I‚Äôm okay with a total ban of all of that. 
---
My step dad is a violent alcoholic. Been in 3 DUI‚Äôs and (1) near fatal wreck. I don‚Äôt drink at all, never have. 
---
Never smoked cigarettes or weed ONCE. 
---
Never done any kind of drugs either. 
---
We CAN live in a world without that and be happy. 
---
Ban all of it from video games. I think most people would come to realize it wouldn‚Äôt drastically change the games. I don‚Äôt go play video games to go get virtual drunk in a virtual bar. 
---
I play to go saw motherfuckers in half. 
---
Sons of dane logging compound. Easy 350 wood with woodchuck perk
---
So I don't think there's a lore reason in game to explain it but Lewis was clearly a huge fan of Nuka cola and had contacted the local production plant. It wouldn't be a stretch to suggest he might have gained access to an early batch of quantum.
---
i always get a ton at pricketts fort
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs harpers ferry. 
---
After level 50 the only benefit to leveling is a broader pool of owned perk cards to use in your build, you won't gain any extra SPECIAL points or increase your HP any further by leveling up. The only difference between a level 50 character and a level 9999 one is that the latter has enough perk cards (and enough leftover points for SPECIAL swaps) to perfectly optimize any given build, but will also yield more caps when killed.
---
If the perks and items (and mutations, etc.) are the same, a level 50 character is the same as a level 5000 character.
---
"My guns go Boom Boom and you guns go pow pow" - Big L
---
Equip woodchucker perk if you have it to double wood you collect. Top left of map is a lumber yard, and there is a lot of logs by vault 76 area. 
---
Woodchucker perk plus there‚Äôs some protections at a lumber place near flatwoods that if you interact with them will give you some, there‚Äôs a big pile at helvetica behind the restraunt too
---
No, I mean for the main Fallout titles. I'm very well aware that the Mothership doesn't crash until the events of Fo3.
---
Nicotine calms the nerves if you‚Äôre addicted to it. So could make it a VATS accuracy bonus. Downfall would be lower AP so you can‚Äôt run or hold your breath while aiming for as long.
---
Dude im level 25 trying to get enough wood to make a good base, im not gonna go around and get it from logs.
---
Ok I can see this. I like. 
---
Who cares on the classification. It‚Äôs a new mode. Who cares how they activate it in my menu 
---
LO. I burned out with my present as he was in Watoga at level 13 for the Handmade  plans and farmed the fuck out of the world. Now I just potter about not looking for anything muc but a few mods and of course Legendaries. ;)
---
Great thankyou for your help
---
Hey, no worries! To be fair, my hands are a bit of a state ;) just saying that there might sometimes be a reason for it, that‚Äôs all üòä
---
What is that perk under?
---
It was a joke. 
---
Lumber yards are best. Helvitia has a large stack of wood that is equivalent to about 5 wood piles. 
---
It‚Äôs a bandaid on a gun shot wound. We already have PA mods. Closest we will get. You‚Äôd have to come up with all new effects that have nothing to do with the current legendary effects we have. If anything you‚Äôd have to add a single legendary to only the torso that governs the whole suit. And even then it‚Äôs not needed. We have PA mods for that.  
---
Next thing you‚Äôll want legendary are grenades. 
---
&gt;The MIRV seems to have issues with firing at any sort of decline. When firing level or up (outdoors) I've had no problem.
---
It's because it's designed to split and fall in a spread when it hits the highest point of the arc. If you fire at any decline, the highest point of the arc is as soon as it leaves the barrel. When it splits, the micro nukes spread in an umbrella pattern, so some of them go straight down, some go forward, and some come back towards you.
---
Tldr: don't fire downwards. Dont fire directly at your target. Fire in an arc *above* your target.
---
if the base is in the forest it is completely useless ..
---
I thought about that, and doublechecked, but it still didn't show up.  I have that perk card maxxed at level 3.  I've also tried hitting &lt;Q&gt; to toggle/hide what I can craft.
---
Offline for now. Send me your GT and I'll trade with you next time I'm on.
---
And you deleted the local ? 
---
Luck. 
---
I think that is a great idea. I would live to be able to have a bunker for a base. Also I'd like to be able to rename my items like FO4!
---
Fallout is set in an alternate universe then our own. Everything has a 50s look, but that are well ahead of us in terms of technology and the bombs that destroyed the world happened a good 70 years from where we are now. So potentially they could add any of these things and it could be lore friendly. 
---
But you flew so far because how a all painted set of X-01 Nuka quantum set refreshes your AP fast.
---
There are bloodied range weapons too, and melee with vats lets you travel decent distance also. Yes the weakness with bloodied is radiation weapons but not everyone keeps them around let alone good one. You could use cavalier unyielding if your lucky to get the full set but you would be using lot of ap running around and when you run out you lose all that defense or if you get stuck.
---
Nice tip, never knew that one thanks man.
---
Absolutely.  I have obsessive compulsive disorder and it sets my thoughts into a repeatable pattern that helps me relax.  
---
Defo seems weak. I'm a filthy casual, so don't know much about "min maxing" (I don't even know what it means tbh so I might have used it wrong here) or squeezing the most out of guns, but my bloodied (non explosive) lever action does way over 400 dmg. 
---
I'm not at my computer atm so can't post build, but it sounds very similar to yours. I got all 3 rifleman maxed, max tank killer (although this doesn't affect the dmg shown in the stats screen), nerd rage. I don't have bloody mess cos all my luck is taken up with starched genes, class freak, and serendipity, so I'm not sure where the extra dmg is coming from. 
---
I do have a few mutations, including adrenal reaction, so maybe that is it. 
---
I have 4 bos paints for the t60 if you still looking for them
---
I have one that is single shot explosive and it does work. My favorite gun by far. Can‚Äôt imagine that two shot
---
I dunno. There's a pretty clear point here.
---
Alcohol might be dangerous but it isnt on the level of cigarettes in my opinion.
---
Most of the drugs in the game are fake so that they dont look like a real world equivalent.  IIRC FO3 originally planned to have real world drugs and had to drop it because they took so much heat over it.
---
We dont want to normalize a hero heroine for stat boosts or keeping meth for whatever.
---
Drinking a beer in a world? Fairly commonplace and arguably kind of harmless. Alcohol has been a part of the world for a long time.
---
Cigarettes are a bit more sinister and I wouldnt want them usable any more than heroin or crack in the game.
---
I can only think of 2 games that had cigarettes.
---
The original Deus Ex had cigs that did a straight 10 pts of damage.
---
Bioshock had cigs that cost health to give mana.
---
Ohh, no. They don't 
---
How about I add you, what's your username?
---
The new Survival mode is meant to have fast travel limited to places like train stations and your own camp, so it would probably be super useful there.
---
Sorry man, it didn't seem like it. My base got nuked when someone launched one and its just the frame of it.
---
 For a solo person its not worth doing. I live in the Mire and why would I fight a Mirelurk Queen for fuck all. 
---
 I can kill her but the rewards do not compensate me nearly enough for that expenditure. 
---
Lumber yards and the forest region of the map. 
---
If you want to kill two birds. Hit up a squad of super mutants. Most of them will be using assault rifles and with the scraper perk you get a good stock of wood and steel done building. It‚Äôs not near the level of lumber yards but. 
---
Lol yeah
---
power armour, melee builds , these are cheap and don't require ammo, a 2 handed sledge hammy, you can pretty much tank a horde of super mutants, go to their location and clear camp, than server hop to do it over, should be 50 by the night
---
Codes u need to üöÄ a nuke. 
---
In college I had to take a lot of busses.
---
Are you not able to decline?  
---
I am playing on PS4 and can decline with a reason like too expensive, not the desired item, don't need and so on.  
---
yup most of the 300 or 400 were made in the first month, my friend and i get to 200 super easy with just hype of New fallout and playing a lot for the first 3 weeks imagine people with more time xd
---
Not sure off the top of my head. Will check today when I can. 
---
lvl 148, did the vendor runs every day since launch.
---
Never spent time farming for stashes and have every plan in the game since yesterday.
---
I'd just get the 1400c a day and go do more fun stuff! 
---
If that means did I kill SBQ, no the group I had tried but she got away
---
This! Also, how about i set prices before i head out, with my keyboard too. Every time i sell serum, it takes roughly 20 seconds to set each one. If the customer accepts it before i set another, it resets me back to the start. Frustrating to say the least.
---
The responder Therapy Sessions are on Monday.  
---
Super unstable, disconnects a lot, had this weird bug were after disconnect and rejoining the keyboard keys don't work like moving, opening pipboy, reloading, but I can press escape to open the map and I have to click on the menu button since keyboard key won't work; yet I can shoot still and fast travel. There is a lot of lag like camps not loading in and have to wait for it, objects in the map not loaded in like stash boxes and train station vendor doors. Disconnecting from the queen or fighting the queen there is a lot of lag, like we were so close to killing the queen then we ran out of time; she stopped moving after the time limit we finished her off and for some reason got the queen event reward also.
---
Look at a beautiful woman (or man), problem solved 
---
ahh yes so it is. I have run into the G man a few times now but since the patch he doesn't really have the same impact as most plans are now evenly distributed 
---
Lotus makes me wonder if she was going be a quest giver or something, why have a named robot that does nothing though.
---
The guy who invented nuka shine also has a freaking robobrain called biv who is the drink tester. Robobrains have not came out of the prototype stage.
---
I think that getting some nuka shines would not be a big deal.
---
The armor legs I have are definitely T51b pieces - I even have the Nuka Cola paint job on them.  One hypothesis I have is if the plan taught me Calibrated Shocks for the wrong armor piece (i.e. X-01 or Ultracite), but I currently have no leg pieces of either armor type.  I know it doesn't show up for the T45 armor, and I think I checked a Raider armor piece too and couldn't craft it on that either.
---
I can see how it could be used, I like the other comments debuffs paired with it because it really does need a little more downfall but I like it 
---
What are you one shotting a bloated ghoul with? 
---
This might be a problem though if they do this. It might affect the whole market community. All items would be increased. 
---
And this is why player vending machines would rock. You load it up with stuff, set the price, and never have to deal with the buyer.
---
I meant having a better use for the gas masks in game. They have a condition bar, but it seemingly doesn't get used up unless you just take full body or headshot damage from enemies. Some kind of a filter mod for disposable gas masks would be nice for RP, I remember those kinds of mods were rather popular for fallout 4 (especially combined with the frost survival mod)
---
Queen is so annoying to fight, but I still think the event is worth since it has a chance to drop rare outfits.
---
you need silo codes to launch a nuke for the Enclave quest "Death from above"  If your not doing that quest I wouldn't bother to collect them yet as they self district after a week 
---
If everyone had everything handed to them, nothing would be special and no one would want anything. 
---
There's a reason games have had things this way for so long and never changed it. 
---
The only 'better' way to make coveted items rare aside from low drop rates, is to have them awarded by something very hard to do. Which would be awesome if the masks were that way, but they arent. And if they were, people would find a way to complain about it.
---
I'm just saying that the "oMg DrOp RatEs ArE tOo LoW," is something people are gonna run into with every game in this sort of genre. People shouldn't expect to escape to Division 2 and get any better drop rates there.
---
Kum n go is gonna sue you.. Lol. Looks good! 
---
My bloody combat shotgun
---
You‚Äôre a Dev?
---
I did this quest maybe 3 times since the last update and haven't had any problems with the heart poofing. Maybe your experiencing server lag? 
---
Nope. Whitesprings farming and just truly enjoying the game. My buddy is 258 and me, being a filthy casual, am at 187.
---
What are you guys hoarding that can't be farmed in 10min? 
---
üòÇ
---
true I got shitted on every workshop even in PA lol
---
They are allowing cross over characters. 
---
The idea is all the busted pvp will go there and test their might. And all the non pvp will stay on adventure. 
---
Will it work who knows. Time will tell. 
---
Ok sure.  Whats the going rate?  
---
Could be lore friendly, but the further along in our timeline it is the less characteristic of the fallout universe it is since the timeline is supposed to diverge around 1920 or so. Most of the mechanics these add exist in the game in some facet already in terms of effects on a player. 
---
I'm more of a [Fisto](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fisto) kinda man myself. ü§£
---
Is this post a joke? ( kidding, Incan see you are upset )
---
A large portion of the 76 community asked for this and Beth actually listened, and rather quickly considering how long they take to things normally.
---
Not sure where your gripe is truly stemming from here but maybe you should just give it a shot or keep playing they way you do currently?
---
Either way. A ton of us are THRILLED! üéàüéâüéäüéà
---
Thats interesting. Thanks for the insight. I'm sure many here would like to know this
---
Why can't I vape nuclear waste in the waste?
---
if you are in a team amd your teammates have artillery it will fire from there or if you claim a workshop. 
---
FFS... why don‚Äôt you wait and trythe fucking mode before bitching around? I‚Äòm so sick of this useless posts and complains..
---
Yes well no much players to play with so gotta befriend them. No other choice am I right?
---
Robo brains are common knowledge around Appalachia. Hell there‚Äôs one teaching at Watoga high. 
---
If anything they are in the initial public testing. 
---
I don't need a description of what a video is that has nothing to do with this lol. I didn't say "images don't work we need videos" I said we don't have any image/video of it dropping.
---
Also what logic is "since they are rare nobody would record the moment they got it"? Getting one of the rarest things in the game is an instant reason to record/save an image.
---
This sounds upsetting, because I eventually want to buy all the PA plans. Now I don't know if I should waste my caps if you don't even get to learn what you paid for.
---
The atom sniper outfit is nice. 
---
Sounds like you got bored and want to do something else with your time. You know that‚Äôs normal right?
---
Appalachian Mudslide?
---
Frost/dust were real survival games. F76 plays like FO4 on normal difficulty but with food/thirst attrition. Both are fun to play, but it'd be much more fun if they went one way or another than trying to do both
---
or it could just do damage over time like actual cigs do.
---
There‚Äôs a western cowboy one in the game but it‚Äôs a event drop I believe. 
---
Yeah,  but for some reason yesterday I couldn't get the event ever, waited 36mins, server hopped a lot, used my new character nothing.
---
This also removes the weapon or armor from your inventory when at a vendor. You can‚Äôt drop painted items either. 
---
I‚Äôve used both at the same time. The missile turret is stronger but looser on targets.  The laser can be more refined.  Combine both. 
---
but we need a place were everyone lives so we can find their vending machines easilly. I was doing some calculation and I think all 24 players can live in the golf fields of whitesprings, some with water and more pretty place than others but we can
---
same
---
Happened to me today :(
---
Eh I‚Äôm not worried 
---
I think it'd be neat if they gave prolonged but weak effects. So that a player could have a chem that stays on in the background for up to half an hour or so. With the risk of addiction of course.
---
Easily conceded.   
---
I am also thinking of my experience with tf2 where your chance of getting an ‚Äúunusual‚Äù cosmetic is less than 1% and you pay $2.50 for each try.  They may have been trying to accomplish this kind of rarity.  I agree there should be more examples of the rare hats and odd that more people aren‚Äôt mentioning that they have one.  If my son received one then I would mention it and then also state that I‚Äôm not going thru the effort to prove it.  
---
Bethesda should have also created a common, uncommon and rare tiered drop system instead.  They had plenty of hats to do this with and it would have done even more to establish trade markets.  
---
I deleted the local GAME FILES not the save game files, any programmer worth a damn would have saved these in a settings file in the system's save game folder not within the game data itself.
---
I play alone for pretty well the same reasons. It's still cool when I run into other people though, and events like Fasnacht and the SBQ are actually really fun with large groups of people.
---
What are your thoughts on a token reward system? Run the event get a token. Save those tokens up to buy what you want. Removes the RNG and those dedicated can get everything. The casuals can save up for the 1 or 2 items they really want.
---
I'm level 320ish. I don't feel the need to prove it. Levels don't mean anything for 90% of players after level 150. But I've seen 400's in the game. 500 wouldn't be a surprise. 
---
That‚Äôs the first mistake. Nuking the mire 
---
Morgantown, Monongah, and Charleston are way better than whitespring. Don‚Äôt have 20 people all trying to TSE a single ghoul. 
---
Well, having gone through more than a few rounds of Bethesda Support now, and having the issue forwarded to a "specialized team", with the same response, I give up. They all say the same thing, to go to GameStop and see if they can resolve the issue.  
---
I'm not about to go jumping through hoops just so these idiots can avoid solving an issue, for a game that frankly, isn't worth the headache.
---
It‚Äôs been unstable on Xbox too
---
Too* far
---
But their not available for the general public to purchase. That's the point.
---
This. ^
---
I do collect them though because of the annoying bleep.  
---
put mines or throw grenades u do nothing to the robots so its ok! that way  I have time to tag the sloth and comeback to defend the back xd
---
AA and swing speed is still pretty good, even without the strength 
---
I stopped playing due to encuberance issues, issues with people using exploits to level, people using exploits to get gear from secret Dev stock piles that should have been removed from released etc...
---
It was clear to me they didn't think the game through enough to be multiplayer... And therefore the only solution was to quit playing.  Anything else would have been too much work or require cheating as well 
---
I know this is not the solution but a work around...
---
Take a pic of the recent players list and if u get disconnect search for the players and join their game.
---
Also being on a team helps. üò¨
---
I would love to have cigarettes or cigars as a cosmetic item. To go on your face like a "mask," to be equipped like a bandana. It would be cool to give you that red glow like in FO4, or like the prisoner collar gives you.
---
In addition to the bar and the restaurant, there is also a soda fountain where you can but different varieties of nuka cola.
---
320. Had to respec a lot because of balance changes and stupid bugs making some build ideas non-viable (looking at **you** herd mentality). I had a collection of about 255 explosive vents from farming the queen for recipes, but go ahead and sling your accusations.
---
I'm a melee build already so that works out well. Is there a good place to farm super mutants? 
---
I'm not saying it's not good, I'm just mad I spent so much and was lied to about the third star. I'm a melee build, so having that extra one strength would be pretty nice.
---
What‚Äôs your build look like?
---
And for building. Google some house images and see what tickles your fancy. 
---
I‚Äôm on a minimalist/tiny house kick and keep trying to go smaller. 
---
Same for me. 
---
I got one were everyone got focused into the sloth and all the robots got Killed by wild wolves lol
---
anyone on pc that i can buy mutations from?
---
Last I checked, Class Freak didn't do anything positive for Empath, and the increased damage seemed to be much higher than 33%. Used to have people throwing away half their mutations to get rid of it.
---
Not sure if anyone's tested it recently. Class Freak and Strange In Numbers were tweaked in a recent patch, and they're generally so buggy that unless you tested them, they probably don't work as expected.
---
Yea, that's my thought as well.  I have a couple other plans I've successfully learned in the past - including Calibrated Shocks for the Excavator armor that I got several weeks ago from (I think) a random drop.  Just not this one.
---
That's fine if you don't, those are your lifestyle decisions. Other people do, and their lifestyle decisions are just as valid.
---
Some people do go get virtual drunk in a virtual bar - they want to be engaged with the game and maybe that means his or her character has the occasional drink, or smokes the occasional cig. Engagement is really what this is all about. The point is in a game that already has and glorifies far worse drugs in it than cigarettes, (and still has cigarettes in it, mind you) to disregard them just seems absurd and goes completely against the general setting of the game. 
---
I'm level 230ish and I rarely see anyone above me. Alot of people who are higher then this used the flame trap xp glitch 
---
id love to see the Grip and Clip mods actually get options, perhaps a comfort grip that increases accuracy and decreases spread. 
---
Yellow building at the end of the street in Helvetia has a wood shed on the back side- I was able to collect 50+ with out any wood related perks 
---
I say top of the world or the galleria  if everyone meets in the same place to trade maybe it will catch on
---
Same as you bud. I explore every single corner of every building of every area.

 My stepdaughter started to play so I do team up with her when shes wants to play but other in that I do not group up even for events.
---
 On top of that I turn everybody's Mics all the way down so I don't have to hear anybody's voice.
---
 Voices are completely Immersion breaking.
---
While it does suck you were lied to, you did end up getting the exact item that you originally posted requesting.
---
I understand you being upset for being lied to, but I suppose on the bright side at least you got something you wanted, albeit a bit overpriced 
---
You can still manage 5-6 levels in 2 hours just spamming big bend tunnel. Boring though.
---
That's BS. Charisma doesn't affect your drops
---
Very much so. They was a brief window of great server response where it felt so smooth and normal. Now 7 out 10 melee swings (melee build) wont 'count' as hitting my target so i have to sit there and just WAIT until one of my hits count and the enemy dies. More recently the last two days I've either been booted from the server after freezing at a workbench or looting to come back into the game and notice that suddenly the atom shop has a new item or new deal (so my conspiracy theory is when the atom shop updates it freezes me) but specifically between tonight and today I've full on crashed twice now. (ps4) My quality in play time is just degrading at this point from the moment I log in and everything I do is with a held breath to see if I get D/C'd or not

R/whooosh

I‚Äôm smoking right now while reading this post. Smoking sucks and it hard to give it up once you start. I wouldn‚Äôt want to see it in game because it really has no benefit and its not cool.
---
That‚Äôs an over saturated and over inflated market for you. 
---
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt buy anything over 2k. Price doesn‚Äôt justify the need.

So pretty much like real life then

I have 10 without the HS and the TY

Starting at Steelheart: FYI you need Marsupial
---
1- Slocum's Joe Building on roof
---
2- Behind Nuka-Cola billboard on top of Steelhearts 2nd stop
---
3- left from last building look straight ahead at the building with the fire escape - get up there, it's under the Mr Fuzzy
---
4- left from last stop go straight look at bank on top of small overhang roof 
---
5- same bank building - behind apartment sign clutched by a female skeleton duo and a yellow box
---
6- the Tent you know about
---
7- up that tall building to the rooftop with the climber, the stealth boy and my sweet sweet caps
---
8- the bus by VT
---
9- Big Al's Tattoo on the roof (fyi there used to be 2 here that you could only expose if you grenaded the wall - now it's just the one)
---
10- Fraternity Row 2 stuffies playing checkers with caps on a porch
---
:)
---
Red Dead 2 had them
---
Dont build so much, problem solved. Many times over, problem solved.
---
I don't mean to disrepsect but you are simply doing it wrong. 
---
Im sure you know, but to be sure: the cost to build at workshops is FREE until you mow through a ton of free resources. The COST of each item changes color if it is going to cost you anything out of your stash.
---
You can build a decent amount free, but if you invest in and slot CONTRACTOR perk in INT tree, it lowers the cost of all workshop items by a ton. 
---
As an example, with Contractor slotted, I can go to Hemlock Holes and build a gold excavator, 3x Acid excavators, a foundation and a stairs with tons of second floor squares, place 6x turrets on the edge of that second floor, drop a Fusion Reactor (that one east 2 pieces of my personal Nuclear Materials to build), hook it all up, drop a few crafting tables and a stove, and get to work. All for free if you are careful.
---
If some ass hat attacks, no worries. Just leave or server hop away or ignore, you dont have to care how things pan out. 
---
Further, I can blueprint Hemlock the way I like, and then capture+ build + defense all takes literally ten minutes from beginning to end.
---
You get loot, property, XP, a fast travel point, some caps, a roll on some plans, and then more of all that if it gets attacked a second time. You get to come back and loot the collectors. You can pull in landscape mobs from the area the workshop is in and let the turrets do the killing. 
---
Your complaint is just in that Bethesda and disconnects are a pain for all of us, and there is no solution to being disconnected (unless you are on a team, then even disconnects dont hurt), but you use hyperbole (they are pointless, pay out the ass materials) so its difficult to discern whether you actually want to hear solutions.
---
I hope a CAMP option comes up where you create a bunker door you can attach to the landscape that goes to an instanced area of your own.  You have to spend resources to dig it out, but can build essentially your own Vault and it can grow as you develop it and complete quests to add new room types.  Also, since it's instanced to you, it would not have much of a load on the world map as the only thing you spawn is the door to your personal instance.  You can also make it accessible to other people, but still a small instance seems like a less drag on server CPU cycles than a world viewable area.
---
It's felt a little less stable for me too since the last patch (PC version here).  One day it crashed two or three times in the span of an hour, then later it was fine for several hours before crashing in the middle of a lockpick attempt.  
---
At the very least allow people to add messages in a mailbox or terminal at your camp... kind of like a guest book.
---
No Mans Sky has this feature (a game which started out with a really bad opening day just like this game).
---
I‚Äôm the same way. I have some friends that I‚Äôll play with once in awhile, but mostly I explore, collect and take pictures. I had a guy follow me around last night as I just explored and send me team invites, and I felt bad ignoring them but I probably lead the most boring fallout existence ever.

Class Freak does actually benefit empath as it decreases damage taken by team mates by an extra 8%. As for testing, i have no friends to help nor an idea to do a realiable test
---
I'll give that a go when I'm next on, see if it helps at all, thanks
---
That's just silly. You can't just ban all things you don't agree with. I understand your reasoning and your personal reasons as well but people are allowed to have their vices. As an adult its nobody's business what I'm doing with my lungs or what I drink. Plus we're just talking about a video game and as this is an M rated game people have been warned of the adult content.
---
Think of the children!
---
Ah, there it is. I have had my camp since Level 35 and it hasn‚Äôt moved once. My camp was built to be a ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù structure, and though I have done minor remodels here and there (mainly involving furniture and decor) the building itself has been the same since level 35. Plus, I have a junk extractor that is continuously harvesting junk that I realistically use very little of, which is why I have so much bulk scrap that I sell daily to robots and players. I use the scrap for repairing things obv, but very little compared to what it generated.

Hot mic. Don't forget to deep-throat the mic; it helps us track the rate, rhythm and quality of your respirations. Personally, I take comfort knowing that each breath you draw next to that live mic brings you closer to your last.  Haha, misophonia is no joke kids! Remember, there's a mute button!

Actually no that's wronv ive got confused with strange in numbers, you're right class freak does nothing 
---
I've gotten a few shinies over the years; they improved the rates and methods in the newer games, so they're getting better about it iirc.
---
No, he's mostly right. If you have a good way to power level you can get away with having a really low level build. According to Nukes and Dragons, [this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5d6539f&amp;d=s01p02pg1ph2pp2pi1em0eo2eh1ce0ir2s72ae2lq0l71lr2lk2lu2sb2la2c72a12&amp;w=cm2au2c81ar1at1ao0lm2if2iq2ik0sa2p10cr0&amp;n=Lonely%20commando%20boi) build needs to get to level 84, but by not selecting perks until after I got him there I was able to get his build set by level 65. I try to keep my characters low level as possible for PvP.
---
No I double checked, they spell theirs with a n'. I don't have the ' so it's 100% different :). Thanks I appreciate it, I'm already thinking of ways to make it better 
---
I said it was preferred, and someone came along with something better, better to me anyways, cause I didn't know that could be a stat on the gauntlet. If I knew that, I would have said I wanted the +1 STR to begin with. I'm mad cause dude bro lied. Probably just wanted the caps, cause if I knew that it had the reduced weight, I wouldn't have paid so much.
---
(Not mad at you or tryna argue with you, cause yeah I did originally want the weight reduced, but that changed cause a better offer came along, if that makes sense)

So, I was a dismissive asshole yesterday, and honestly? I lack the time or resources to effectively test whether 5 DPS is lowered in pacifist mode or not. I think that effectively, you're correct and my comment(s) was not helpful.

Not that it matters when pacifist changes, what? Next week? But hey. Mea culpa.

Workshops should produce more than they do. Take the total your workshop makes in one hour... I‚Äôm willing to bet 1,000 caps you could easily farm 2-3 times as much materials just going to certain locations...

I think I was able to get around that issue with a pressure plate, but I can't recall how exactly I wired it since I never figured out how to get the door rotated correctly so the keypad was outside not inside (I was running out of CAMP budget at the time so I scrapped it all anyway and went back to a regular door).

I meant Wild Appalachia, which is the name for upcoming content additions to the game. The "Wild" is probably a direct refenrence to Wild Wasteland trait in Fallout New Vegas. If you took WW in FNV, you'd encounter much stranger and "wilder" encounters, including even some aliens. I guess that anything new about the space station would be quite crazy and "Wild"...

In red dead 2 you can chew tobacco it has positive and negative effects. They could do this in 76. As an example it damages x% hp over time but refills your ap x% faster.

Happened to me again last night, some duded were farming me for caps on my new character, destroyed like 95% of my camp.

Where would you put the extra 4 points remaining then?

98% of the complaints I've heard about fo76 are from people who've never even seen it played. IMO people hate what bethesda makes until they try it, once it's stable[ish].

Ok. Thanks!! :)
---
You‚Äôre right, however this is the USA. People can try to ban whatever they please. Currently Hawaii is trying to raise the legal age to smoke to 100. People left and right are trying to ban certain types of guns. 
---
People can also try to ban things that deem harmful to others. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so many petitions to ban guns. 
---
Here‚Äôs my thoughts on smoking though‚Äî it‚Äôs not just you. Unless you‚Äôre smoking in some isolated place, you‚Äôre affecting other people. Second hand smoke is dangerous, plenty of studies prove that. The smell permeates everything. Cars, walls, homes, everything. I mentioned earlier, but about once a month I have to take all my jackets to the dry cleaners just to get the stench off. How‚Äôs that fair for me because YOU enjoy smoking? 
---
Thank you for this.
---
I'll send you a snap of my porch when I log on in a few hours bub! If you're on ps4 my gf and I love to build if you need help.
---
OP does have a good point. The only explanation I could think of is that Nuka-Cola had some real security problems, as well as a disgruntled employee issue (no spoilers, but it's in-game.) Plus, if it were due to be released the day the bombs fell, shipments would have gone out in advance, and therefore staged somewhere. Any time you have people involved, you have a potential operational/information security issue.

If i'm without I'll be a little cranky in the morning and struggle to sleep without my morning/bedtime cigarettes, but once i have caffiene in my system im more or less totally fine. Though i have bee. Working on slowly reducing how much i smoke (from averaging 25 a day to about 6 a day over the last 4 months)
---
Once a power armor is complete (all parts) there should be an option to [DISPLAY PA] but once you do it becomes part of your CAMP like a chair or other items. 
---
I think that‚Äôs a reasonable trade for Bethesda. 
---
If I recall correctly, I got mine from a defend workshop event. 
---
I‚Äôve completed the event several times since last update with zero problems. I solo it easily. 
---
One of the old exploit youtubers had an account in the upper 800s which could be verified just by watching through videos if anyone can remember his username. Last I saw a video from him was on the xp exploit that had you clicking a button repeatedly. Dunno if we wanna count people who clearly used xp exploits but trying to figure out who did or didnt would be a real can of worms
---
Honestly, i've never experienced a shortage of gears. I can't think of what they're in but my thinking is that maybe you're not picking up and scrapping everything you come across.

East of Flatwoods over the railroad tracks is a military base called Camp McClintlock. The main building has a dozen or two clipboards which the robots had been using to sign up new recruits. Piles of them, some alone on each desk or counter, some piled up in boxes, they are everywhere :)

What perks bring a weapon up to 2,000 dmg? That‚Äôs crazy.

---
Pc, they seemed to have started only in the last 2-3 days
---
Even when you don't overuse materials and start digging into your own its pain. I can't get a defend event to trigger a second time (because of disconnects), blueprinting (though very helpful) should not be damn near a requirement in order to get more materials before getting dropped. And being on a team causes more server drops than having a workshop. Even if you blueprint everything and keep it within the workshop budget, take it over, build, and do the first defend event(which usually uses more ammo than I will produce before getting dropped), it's at that point really hard to bring myself to even use it. They are intended to be held onto until taken from you or until you quit the game, not a 30 minute timer till you're kicked off.

Anywhere with tools usually has a few adjustable spanners which have gears so hit up a few small towns and you can probably pick up 6 or 7 gears.

Wade airport has a few tool sheds so you can get a few gears from there
---
Morgan town has a few places but you will have to do a bit of hunting.

Or worst comes to worst. go to Point present, get some Mothman eggs, make Mothman egg omelet, sell to vendor and buy some bulk Gears. Or just buy them anyway. With Hard bargin level 3 they only cost 150 caps for 10 gears.

Lol wanna meet up and trade?

Congrats. I have only seen one Flatwoods Monster and it ran away when I fired. I still haven't seen a Mothman.

Hi, I'm _____ and I've got a problem.

This comment made me curious so I did some cursory reading. Actually according to a WHO report from 2011 tobacco use kills far more people than alcohol use by almost 3 times as much (6 million to 2.3 million) though to be fair I've only read the summary by now and am not sure whether that tobacco number is specifically smoking or just general tobacco use.

Get some friends and go to Whitesprings nuked or not it‚Äôs an amazing cap and XP farm!
---
If youre running a low hp build I recommend some points in dodgy. 
---
In order to launch a nuke you need silo launch codes. There's 8 silo code pieces for each silo (alpha, bravo and Charlie) and they're all carried by ghoulified officers out in the wild (that's the distinctive beeping you'll hear occasionally).
---
And while the game really wants you to slowly gather all 8 and decrypt the numerical passcode using a complex cipher and a code word, all you really need to do is acquire at least one code piece for the silo you intend to run, a nuclear keycard (you get these shooting down drones. You should also carry a couple spares in case you screw up.) and then wait for the nukacrypt folks to decrypt the nuclear codes. This process takes anywhere from a couple hours to a couple days and resets every Monday evening (US time).
---
So you don't have to bother gathering them unless you intend to launch a nuke. But I usually grab them anyway just to stop the goddamn beeping. Plus hey you never know when you might be bored and feel like nuking a thing.
---
Love all This :) what are your entry requirements 
---
At level 40 you should have discovered all of the vendors. Doing so you can make 1,400 caps a day less fast travel cost... do it daily and your problem is solved.
---
Oh yeah. I've taken to using redditor-made maps of supplies and loot and just making farming runs. Way more worth it even if there's no event bonuses. 
---
I had a legendary super mutant run away from me once. Ran after the guy only to find he kited me into two of his buddies, both with miniguns

Well played, ya bastard

I‚Äôm not the doctor. I‚Äôm wear pastors vestments but confession is over.

I've gone on a couple of hunts today and grabbed so much to the point where I couldn't run. My inventory was pretty much max, I scrapped everything and got like 2 gears

Had they not let characters crossover I would have started a new character and played on the survival.
---
 As it stands right now, no thank you.
---
Really are players complaining about thinking they should continue to hold n keep a workshop after they have logged out¬ø How does that make any amount of sense. . .I would explain how horrible that idea is but I shall not. Should find it a logical choice that players not be allowed to hold onto something that is not single player owned. It is not your workshop it is the servers. And if you are not home. It is completely free n open game.
---
100% agree! I took workshops once just for the atom challenge then never took any after that, wasn‚Äôt worth it. 
---
Look at all the stuff you can get just at White Springs alone! Too easy for any level to farm and if you have the right perk cards you can find even more! 
---
I found hunting scorched beast, going from one fissure to another is a lot faster and more fun than doing whitesprings. And it seems here recently the ghouls are always low level when I go check it out. Still a good place to hit for junk tho
---
Not this guy. Obvious drama stirring for attention and "good drama" don't always correlate
---
You should try to do that before launching all over the map. Most places outside of white spring , prime and Charleston don‚Äôt have a lot of Enimies  to rack up exp and ledendaries. 
---
Not griefing 
---
You are one of the lucky ones. 
---
Nah, PC. 
---
&gt; It's also not by the same company. In the end it's up to Bethesda on if they're adding it or not.
---
Well, you‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs a ratings issue. It‚Äôs not. 
---
And it‚Äôs not much of a controversy. Obviously Bethesda decided against it, but it‚Äôs not a legal/ESRB issue.
---
I have been having a lot of disconnects on PC as well.
---
A fast travel mat is also already in the game, and I'd rather have that at my front door than a machine? But if you want to fast travel onto a machine, you do you. 
---
People leading Gutys to my CAMP bothers me. I know I have a lot of turrets, but I still prefer to not come back and find my shit destroyed. At least repair shit if you actually beat the enemies. I try to repair stuff in someone's CAMP if I actually use anything, sometimes even if I don't.
---
Yeah you dumb 
---
My sons game had one.  Don‚Äôt remember where tho
---
And u just happen to be reading this thread?
---
Ah, cool. Anything worthwhile from this event?
---
That's not a bad idea. I had an idea for bunkers and a terrain tool to change the landscape but it didn't go well. Hopefully it gets implemented.
---
For sure there's a few along the north side
---
*Smoke grenades, could be useful if they were a "special" smoke that blocked targeting huds/mentats/nightvision
---
*Flash grenade, CC grenade of sorts/whites out screen with obnoxious noise?, maybe useful
---
*Bandages, why? add a bleeding effect to all wounds? sounds like just another pita mechanic to add more stuff to grind/carry
---
*T.E.N.T, why? Camps were intended to be mobile, not the mansion homesteads they are being used as.  If you want mobile keep your CAMP light, redundant mechanic
---
*Helmet addons, yes bring functionality up to par with PA helmets, some defense on them might be nice as well
---
*CBRN equipment, yes something that can be worn over or under body armor without removing it would be good, aside from nuke zones not really needed though
---
*Gas masks filter replacements more needless grind, lacks game systems which really need them
---
*Hats sure whatever, more varied looks the better
---
*Buddy carry why? a stimpack animation is faster than an over the shoulder and run away animation, and the running part would get you killed if it was that dire of a situation that you had to move them
---
*CB radio why? Maybe they could add a radio operator type backpack when they go in just for the look?
---
*Bunkers more CAMP parts sure...

Wouldnt want to encourage smoking.

You are just mad because you're angry.

You just forgot the /s, right?

You can also smoke in GTA V

Not to ignore much of your reply, but you said:  being on a team causes more server drops

Ive wondered about this a lot, but only have my own aneecdotal evidence. I'd love some other posters to weigh in on this, as I do play alone most of the time and would love to know the nuts and bolts of this detail! For sure I'm already annoyed at being disconnected and losing my worksops over nothing :( I can't imagine that part being worse.
---
For the record, I upvote anyone who says "Bethesda, fix the disconnects!"
---
Also, your post sounds ammo factory specific. TBH, I spend much more time taking Acid and Junk producing shops. Everyone will agree that the ammo workshop is a hotbed of PvP and in high demand. In fact, it's probably the only workshop anyone ever takes from me (with a few isolated exceptions). When I log off, I try to give the workshops away, haven't been able to since 2018. Literally everyone is suspicious of you trying to give them away!
---
Exactly! And as far as ammo, I just get it here. People will dump off their unused ammo for almost nothing so if you find a player who uses different ammo you can usually buy it at 4ammo per cap
---
Psycho-buff is my jam! Except I ACTUALLY got addicted recently! Finally had a reason to use one of my 15 addictols!

There's like 2k people on this sub or something and way more players. Confirmation bias doesn't make it actually a thing.

Kill everything and do all the atom challenges at the same time. 
---
Farm and break down as much weapons as you can. 
---
At level 30 just go back and redo quest trails and kill more! The XP alone will get you going!
---
No I'm just and idea thinker like you. This post is to make an idea and to have others to give pros and cons before the rest of the community. It's up to the community and eventually Bethesda to make the finally choice on the idea.
---
I know II won't believe me because tHeY'rE bUgGeD but I've seen someone in the sun mask on PS4 on Thursday.

Unique masks and CAMP items that won't be available later on.
---
If you have already made all the caps from vendors in a day, you can gain additional caps by killing enemies. Super mutants drop 0-7 caps, and west tek has over 50 of them. Additionally, you can get 10-20 caps by killing grafton monsters, megasloths, and super mutant behemoths. They respawn about every half hour, so you can put you camp near a garenteed spawn point, and kill one whenever you return to camp. For this, I recommend a camp near hemlock holes or Charleston for the grafton monster, and near Solomon pond for the behemoth.
---
Well I've done everything you recommended and nothing worked. I've had the game for less then a week!
---
And the dev room was t accessible on console
---
Pick up every telephone, typewriter, hotplate and clipboard you see and you will never be short of springs or gears. Put your camp next to a junk deposit. Gillman's lumber mill has as least 1-5 boxes of gears, I think I found 5 boxes my first time if you look carefully, in the house with the tinker bench. Never run out of gears now ..

Our local grocery store is stocked with pepsi by a man who is solely paid in expired pepsi products. I don't remember the specifics, but it saves the actual pepsi worker something like 100 miles a day, something something restock fees? I dunno. It also means the almost expired stuff from all the other stores is funneled here, so's the local dude gets enough to make it worth his while.
---
What I'm taking two paragraphs to say is, I totally believe that you could pay off a Nuka worker for early access. And Lewis clearly had the capital.

If anything it's a mercy killing, soldier. Don't let emotion distract you from your duty to put these things out of their misery.

I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs too bad of an addiction. I pop one just about every fight anyway since I‚Äôm a melee build. But I suppose my character is a psychotic, murderous, murdering, murderer
---
Nuking Helvetia is a griefer move at the moment. Otherwise, Whitesprings is as bad as anywhere for mission blocking, so fire away. Most low-level places aren't great for nuking, although Morgantown makes a change from Whitesprings.
---
The clipboards have _springs_ my friend not _gears_. Gears are found in mechanical devices like desk fans, watches, typewriters and cameras.
---
Thanks. Yeah, I just looked them up. Not really my bag. 
---
For me, it‚Äôs Beach Boys. Gotta cruise in the PA to that jam.
---
I‚Äôve never had to buy ammo... I find so much scrap and using ammo perk I just make it. All on top of finding it everywhere with the luck ammo find perk. 
---
I‚Äôm always dumping ammo like 38 and so on off to lower levels
---
I have no idea for any specific weapons, but sometimes a thicker walled barrel is used to improve stability, or longevity, and weapons will be built differently to accommodate higher pressure rounds, commonly called +P. It's the exact same round, with a tiny bit more powder. It increases muzzle velocity and kintetic energy.
---
I see your points. Each idea has it's pros and cons. I love your thoughts and will incorporate them with the rest of the community.
---
TBH I wish we could have a voting system inside the post too for ideas.

I farmed events and crafter a ton from level 30ish to level 50. Went pretty quick. Plus you get plans and aid and such.

I probably look for a new place. Found one but found out that 2  Scorchbeast where in that area and they attacked my base. What wounders me is that this happend now, between updates. 
---
Ive played almost 200 hours and STILL havent come across it. I know i can look up where it is but i wanna stumble across it. Can anyone tell me what region its in without giving me any directions?
---
Man I've never been PvPd over a workshop. Probably get disconnected too fast. And just straight up luck. As far as being In team causing disconnects, i 100% guarantee it's TRUE. I've been by myself mostly but when i join teams I'm usually loading back in multiple times at every event, trying to log back in multiple times after a death because my loading screens freeze. I can't even use friends to transfer between characters because I'll have to spend 20 minutes trying to get my stuff back from a friend while they agrevatingly watch me get disconnected 5 times while they wait on me so they can actually play the game.

Increase your CHA because you look cool but reduce END (because it's bad for your lungs) and reduce PER because the smoke makes you cry.
---
Yeah lol
---
Lol I‚Äôm about the same not vents plans but rolling pins and tire irons. A lot of leveling went into different levels of the same perk, i.e. several levels of expert heavy gunner so I can mix match them easier. 
---
Theres one in grafton, right near the house/gas station type building that you have to lock pick to enter, right by the pond. 
---
As much as I find it, I use more. I didn't like my first character so I made a second and have been level farming them to get to my friends' levels. I have lots of ammo I don't use either. (Probably 6k 308 and 4k 38 atm) so I buy 5.56 and .45 on top of crafting and finding it. 
---
According to that report it does state that alcohol does cause far less deaths like you say. Although what it fails to depict is how half of all the problems listed as causes for death go hand in hand. High blood pressure for an example can have nothing to do with drugs and just be a condition and individual is born with or inherits, but honestly what I feel is more likely is that that is secondary effect of both smoking, and drinking. Same goes for bad diet, no heavy drinker has a good diet and so on and so forth which leads onto the other causes of death listed. Plus the smoking industry has been shunned into oblivion (rightly so), but alcohol is far from being the lesser of the two evils and it is widely advertised worldwide. They should be treated as one and the same as unpopular an opinion it is. But thats just me, I used to smoke and quit almost a year ago and dont plan to go back, but alcohol is no better an alternative.

Pricket's Fort has at least 100-200 in a single location, use woodchuck perk

I'm glad you enjoy them.

That's an interesting game never played it. You might enjoy Day R on Android.
---
Why pvp at your camp specifically? Only thing i can think of is to have some form of advantage which would defeat the entire point of wanting to PVP for me atleast. Could very well be something im not thinking of though.
---
Totally agree It would be helpful more than anything. More opportunities for trade is good. People could just list what they have real quick in the chat instead of selling it to a vendor.
---
I'm going to keep saying this, if only to fight the prevalent narrative of everyone being unhappy about the rare masks.
---
I took it's fine to have items that are so rare that even people who put in a lot of time will probably not get them.  I didn't get any rare masks, and I probably won't.  But how awesome is that for those lucky few? Most rare stuff in games like this I know that people either: 
---
A) Bought it. 
---
B) Ground for it. 
---
C) Cheated for it.
---
Finally here is something that's actually special.  Not everyone can have a golden ticket, and I'm actually happy with that, even if I don't get one.
---
LOL Ill go home now as Im clearly drunk :)
---
Thanks for being gentle on the reply ;)

Gears are in mechanical devices: desk fans, watches, cameras and typewriters. This makes offices good places to raid if you need gears (and their cousins screws and springs found in clipboards).

aye aye

Etiquette =/= restricting other's capacity. This is some Harrison Bergeron level shit.

Yeah it's lame, I had a beautiful complex camp in Flatwoods which I spent a lot of time on .. 
---
I did the same thing. And then I did it for shotguns. And then 1H melee. Then 2H melee. And now I use unarmed.

...yeah if i had those I'd never swap haha. The only reason i stuck with these is "free stats"

Most of the time if you get a party invite from a rando it means they're hoping to use you as free fast travel. They probably don't wanna be bffs.

Got another update from Bethesda, they acknowledge that my account indeed was able to play Fallout 76 previously, but apparently something just, went wrong with the code, and there is nothing they can do.  
---
All I know is, I am not about to spend any more money on trying to play this again, was... Moderately fun while it lasted I guess? Anyway, I'm done. Y'all have fun playing this, I'll have fun spectating the further downfall of this once amazing company.
---
Glad you do. You talking about renaming weapons? We need those.
---
It's also considered polite to let everyone tag mobs before you kill them. I think you're being somewhat hyperbolic.
---
I think it would be a great idea to allow smoking. They could make them very addictive and the withdrawals could take effect at shorter intervals.
---
Long term effects could be based on play time, effecting endurance, cause tumors, and coughing fits. 
---
They could even increase charisma (smoking is cool) for a short duration.
---
Basic requirements. Combat competence and general aptitude is an asset. Undying loyalty to the Enclave and the continuity of the United States of America. 
---
Highly recommend the STALKER games, especially if you look to the amazing mod community to make them even better.

Won't somebody PLEASE think of the children!?!
---
You should care. You bought the game. This was the first incarnation before they bowed their heads to the masses. We should all care because of the extra xp and event items. adventure mode is now not the best way to level or to get gear. it wreaks of preferential treatment towards pvp players. 
---
I'm playing on pc too, would you mind selling one and if yes how much would you take? 
---
Sweet! You are a master, haha. I have been running around with Fortune Finder on constantly for two months now and hadn't found over half of those. I shall observe, document, and add them to the big list. Eventually I will break the list up by region, and re-post it as an evolving guide. And I will credit you of course for all your help!
---
It's not explosive. Only 1*
---
Events, farm whitesprings and Blackwater mine, go to areas that have higher level enemies and start pulling some xp. At level 30 you'd still have storyline quests, wouldn't you? Just avoid Watoga until you are close to level 50. Getting the All Rise sledgehammer at level 50 makes it worthwhile to melee players. Either you keep it, or sell to someone.
---
Sometimes you don't get to hit an enemy... It happens.

I've been farming that spot outside of Wavy Willy's gatehouse the last few days. Out of 40ish jumps, I've come across one red mirelurk king, one softshell mirelurk, a level 10 vicious wolf (his name is now Mr. Nibbles), and a beaver. Also, sooo many marshals, corpses (with maps!), that beeping officer, among others. But it's a short run from your load point to the spawn.
---
If anyone has a better spot, please feel free to make me wrong. :D
---
Yea tried them all and now pretty much Heavy Gunner, it‚Äôs just so efficient and has the reach I need when fighting sb and crowd 
---
Understandable but at the same time the representation  of psycho although not inherently wrong (like cigs) doesnt make me want to shoot up heroin so your argument really isn't valid.
---
Also a new player been playing a month now met loads of nice people got a friends list full of them and they often hop onto my world and help me level up I have limit time to play each week so its a great help and lot of fun.
---
As others had said watch out for workshops... I've stopped claiming them as within minutes I tend to have someone taking it over not because they want it but they just want to pvp and its always a high level character doing it.....
---
The inspiration for Vim.
---
That's so painful!
---
Maybe it's karma for you never getting workshop-PvP lol
---
I can 100% confirm that back in beta, being on a team caused disconnects much faster. A good 30 minutes tops to stay connected after taking one workshop alone, chances of instant disconnect were way higher when taking multiple workshops in the same session, and when my original gaming pals were playing, we got many more disconnects while teamed up. 100% was observable and recordable. BUT since around Xmas Ive had few and infrequent disconnects, and when they do happen and Im on a team, everyone gets dropped at once, together. I assumed it was the entire server, though I never screenshot the recent-players screen like that other poster suggested for followup.
---
I love you
---
Collect all the guns they drop even if over encumbered  then go scap them, you will learn pipe gun mods fast
---
Be honest it's pretty easy to find tarberries all over the cranberry bog, in just 5 min I found over 16 and I didn't have to fight a thing.
---
The rarest I've seen is the fasnacht beret. I got the witch, owl, toothy man, soldier and giant. Really want the old man winter bonfire plans.

He‚Äôs made because he doesn‚Äôt want PVP when Bethesda wants pvp 
---
My build is not exactly hit and wait for everyone else ready..... I have to take a risk so you can get a shot in? And hope this wendigo doesn't murder me and you take all my shit? 
---
No thanks.
---
More of pvp they don‚Äôt want it when Bethesda does 
---
We need modders in fallout 76 and apart of the team. Give them all alot of love Bethesda. 
---
I'll check it out.
---
Sorry hear about that.
---
Pick the weapons up and then scrap them. You learn mods by scrapping gear.
---
If you want rad storms to do high rad damage to rad suits, they'd need to alter the resistance of the suits. That would mean that either the suits would be less effective overall, or that the storms would be so powerful they'd override the massive resistance of the suits.
---
I'm with you that the storms should be more powerful, and maybe last longer, but hazmat suits are kinda sacred. Have you ever been in a nuke zone without a hazmat suit or suitable rad resist? You'd last seconds. And you want more rad power or reduction of the hazmat suits effectiveness
---
After TSE got nerfed my DPS took a big hit. I usually run around unarmed, but switch to 2H so I can lay down some DPS on the queen with a bloodied buzz saw blade. That boy rips
---
Thank you, I'm a newbie, but I do not understand how they still let you write in the forum.
---
Maybe the favorite button should do that. Also so you can't scrap it or drop it
---
I've worn it non stop since 3 weeks after launch.  No impact
---
maybe

Nice trick! Thanks for sharing

Is that the one with the mound of dirt outside with wooden blocks that spell ‚Äúmy angel‚Äù?
---
Gears of War‚Äôs Lancer doesn‚Äôt make me want to go chainsaw people in half, either. 
---
Media representation of smoking and drinking ABSOLUTELY influences youth to make these kind of decisions. Why do you think there‚Äôs such a large lobbying group against smoking ads? When‚Äôs the last time you saw a positive smoking ad on TV or on a billboard? 
---
The argument is perfectly valid. 
---
OK thanks
---
Considering Morgantown is the home of Vault-Tac university, it isn't so hard to stretch to consider that that may have been a test market/area for Quantum.
---
My bloody build doesn't have the gear to be devastating, but it's effective...
---
But not so effective that I can stop swinging so another player can get in on it. Shoot the fucker while I'm smashing his face, if you don't get the chance....sorry. 
---
I'm not being rude, I'm trying no to die.
---
Stop what should they have called it? Like a directors cut out something? 
---
This.  I just started a new character which I said I‚Äôd never do, and I‚Äôm really really enjoying playing it from the beginning, I missed so much the first time around!  Hit level 23 in a couple days just by doing quests and exploring.  
---
So it is an automated farming system? That sucks.
---
I‚Äôm so sick of this damn event I‚Äôve done it like 70 times and I only  get owl old man gaint man or witch  nothing else it what the f
---
Yeah noticed that myself too! Got a Chameleon, Speed Demon &amp; Marsupial mutation, suppressed Gauss rifle and the Predator gameplay is spot on :-)
---
Bloodied is great, my favorite now is a bloodied 50 cal and also a bloodied gatling, more power than TSE version now when you drop health low enough. 
---
Right? Eewwwww lol.
---
Oh yeah. Taking multiple would kick me out or freeze me up almost instantly. Having even 1 workshop AND being on a team? Repetative disconnects until I leave the team. It's awful. So instead of teammates I just follow people haha
---
So it's not at all what OP is bitching about. 
---
When in Nuke zones: Get "Rad Sponge" perk, 1 point in CHA, team up, share the card. Pairs well with "Ghoulish" from END.

Yes they were all connected except for like 2 of them
---

---
just want to say thanks to jims for getting me the mutation, cheers mate

Yeah man, I wouldn't mind selling you one. I just posted my first "shop" post over in the Market 76 reddit, so if you'd like to leave a comment here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/b4z8cu/pc_h_legendary_weapons_and_armor_plans_including/
---
with your offer, I'm sure we can reach an agreement!
---
I've heard of several people on disability, or with other situations, where aside from watching TV or something there's very little else for them to do besides play games.  I can definitely see where playing 76 would be a great way to cope with being stuck inside.
---
I got you fam:  The fish lamp is in the 4th row from the top in the lights section, and all the way at the end on the right. It's the section with the yellow table lamp in the beginning. 
---
Find LIGHTS tab, find YELLOW table lamp showing by default, it'll be in there!
---
Also, for the future, you can toggle those lists, turning off all non-bought things. Super easy. My controller is XBOX style and for me it is pushing in on left thumbstick. Same L3 press in all crafting screens, super useful when cooking in particular.
---
So go into build mode, look at the bottom of the screen for the menu options, and click whatever removes all non buildable items, that'll clear out the lists and make finding your snazzy fish lamp much easier. or just go to lights tab and find that yellow table lamp and scroll to the left for a bit. Either way, the lamp rocks and you amde a fine purchase.
---
Do you know how ridiculous you look when you say a request for legendary PA is comparable to legendary grenades? Either bring something of value to the conversation or move along.

I hate smokers and vapors, mainly because they act like they aren't doing anything wrong when they're clearly doing it where they shouldn't. They always act all pompous about it and blow their crap at you on purpose. 
---
And then they usually give you a laconic "sorry" and then maybe they'll move away, usually not.  
---
Vapors pissed me off when they try to educate you on how much better their habit is compared to cigarettes. 
---
I don't care if it "smells good" or Nobody want to see, much less breathe the air that just came out of your nasty - ass mouth!
---
The worst case I'd seen is a pack of vapors watching a kids baseball game on a cool humid day and watching those Vape clouds travel right over to the kids faces. It was like something right out of a cartoon.
---
Can you just imagine finding a random shed and there's a hatch in there leading to an underground Camp bunker. Now _that's_ an online Fallout I could envision.
---
Also imagine concrete being as valuable as gold in game, because everyone wants to make bunkers. It'd change things up
---
Yes unless I am meeting someone at their camp to trade I don't randomly stumble into other camps that often
---
You can fast travel to train stations from what I've read. 
---
Thanks You so much 
---
On an explosive gun..does the damage shown in the stats account for the 20% already?
---
Great offer but I'm on PS4.  Thx.
---
Probably because mentats and Jet aren't real, while cigarettes are.
---
Not saying I agree with it, but that's most likely the reason.
---
Yes like a train station or middle of map near the top of the world
---
Nah, I built an arena. It just looks cool.

The old man winter mask is was an atomic shop exclusive item that was up for buy for 500 points at the very beginning of the event date. Like I have old man summer and the moon mask. I was just forgetful and forgot to graby the winter mask while it was in the shop.
---
When I'm online later lol
---
I'm willing to lay down cash that this is the solution. Default icon is the yellow table lamp, find it and start scrolling left and right :)
---
I dislike it because smoking kills so, so many people, and isn't seen as "as bad" to kids.
---
But if it were in game it would have to have some pretty hefty drawbacks. +1 perception, +1 charisma, slow hunger, but very, very high chance of sludge lung.
---
So, in other words, don't add this.
---
Finnaly started working although I get too lucky and die before I can heal but it‚Äôs working now
---
Yeah that's true and I have definitely found some good 3* legendarys from the vendor

Thank you phr3k

More than likely, actually definitely, that‚Äôs someone alt character. Seeing how that thing is like 1k from the responders vendor but I see people selling the 2-3k all day!!!

Yeah that's a great point - it's not a study of the behaviors themselves but of the underlying diseases, many of which can have different and multiple causes. Right there among the four main risk factors (two of which are alcohol/tobacco use) they list physical inactivity and unhealthy diet, which from intuition I'd have to agree with you go hand in hand with the substance abuse. 
---
It would be interesting to see the specific effects of either be more accurately determined, but I don't know how likely that is considering just how much overlap there probably is between the diseases brought on by them all.
---
Look under community options on rights, under flair

yeah we should agree on that area i think because if someone is not there is because they aren't interested in trading anything xd

Biv is part of the new update. You have to read one of the party signs at a train station to start the quest.

I should be allowed to smoke at my house or at private businesses or even public places that have designated areas. In pubic spaces I would accept it if they decided to ban it like sidewalks and what not.  All this other stuff you're bringing up is besides the point, lets try to stay on topic. Also you need to have a talk with the asshole that's making you breathe in his secondhand smoke though because if you're close enough everyday that you need to have your stuff dry cleaned to get the smell out then somethings wrong. 
---
So, this sounds like the real meat of your complaint. Do you feel that you're going to miss out, were you to choose not to take advantage of Survival Mode's incentives?

Thank you! Stop by anytime!!

Im not saying it doesn't influce im saying its no more glorified than murder in the games tho

Not just supermutants, other Legendaries run too they just don‚Äôt shout it out. You don‚Äôt get to survive like a legend by going into all the fights lol

How do people even steal in this game?

1400 caps
---
I wouldn't recommend hitting hot spots for screws unless you're into server hopping. Too many other players grinding the same locations. You're better off running through lots of places with smaller quantities IME.

Buying screws is excusable, although it's cheaper to buy them from players. High level players often don't need them anymore.
---
Usually for SBQ the real high level players show up..I usually don't see these players anywhere else
---
I just think my game glitched is all I‚Äôve had this game since release 
---
Old man winter was an atomic shop exclusive item that was for sale for 500 points for the first 2 days of the event.
---
I've seen a lot of people cheated lately. People are getting ready for PvP servers it seems. I thought i would give that mode a chance but not anymore. 
---
175-235
---
No nerf is needed. This does not make you invincible or anywhere a bullet sponge. Have low health is the nerf. This is powerful, but not too powerful. A nerf would make this armor completely pointless and give another reason for PA to be used, or that super over powered sentinel armor.
---
I've seen owl on xbox, is that one?
---
Maybe toothy should have a 50% chance for mole rats to not become hostile toward you
---
Just pointing out that it doesn't have to be explosive. So kinda yeah
---
So? You can't take a shit either.
---
Yassss this needs to happen. I love the creativity in the game. It needs to grow more.
---
Since they added milking peeps milk your cow and it runs far from camp....
---
The Pitt from Fo3 is just north of toxic valley. No idea how messed up it is. And a nuke did hit to the south. 
---
Would be nice to see the outer areas of the Capital Wasteland. 
---
Some of these songs I hear so often they are burned into my brain. BONGO BONGO BONGO I DONT WANNA TO LEAVE THE JUNGLE OH NO NO NO NO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Although I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs foreshadowing, I for one would absolutely love to see the Capital Wasteland this early after the war. We also know that there were dust storms in the Capital Wasteland at this time so they could introduce new weather systems entirely.  
---
You have been, mate.
---
I will buy your baret if you're on Xbox. 
---
There are places you can build underground. Camp I went to a few nights ago in watoga was in that cave that runs under the highway near there.
---
I found one yesterday at the overseers house and found 52 caps inside, top floor
---
Yeah, it's a cool community atmosphere in Fallout 76, isn't it? Early in the game, I was running around in Flatwoods when a pretty higher level lady waved "Hi" and dropped a paper bag for me with 50 Purified Water and 50 Super Stimpaks in it. üòö I gave her a bobble head and an assortment of cool chems.
---
Next, I accepted a random team request and teleported out to the swamp. It was a male player with a mic. Suddenly dude's angry girlfriend got on the mic, and I heard her ragging on him for team requesting me, a female player. Her sraight-up ghetto voice went on ragging on him for so long that finally, I couldn't stand the sound of her voice anymore. I ran away. üòÆ
---
I have around 300 hours and I never got even 1 explosive or two shot weapon
---
Thats already in Nukacola Dark. 
---
An opinionated arguement has a "folly"... weird flex but ok.
---
I gave them to the low levelers. Don't worry lol. 
---
  Was just curious as to how hard they were to get. 
---
I'm not one to farm or exploit this game. As it kills off its playability pretty quickly. 
---
You're thinking Old Man Summer.
---
A fully auto quad gamma gun will make those special become zero when their dead. 
---
Its in the Nuka Cola Dark. 
---
Yeah, I love Gauss, however this has been an issue since FO4, and appears to be tied to the recoil inherent in the weapon itself. Between this bug and the fact that the "Grounded" mutation exists, I'd rather rock a lever action or, dare I say, and Instigating Dragon/Executioner's Black powder rifle combo.
---
Be nice, Mentats are people too. 
---
Destroying a player‚Äôs camp after the battle is over isn‚Äôt griefing?  I admit that teaming up to contest and snipe isn‚Äôt griefing, but it‚Äôs certainly underhanded.  I stopped taking workshops because of these tactics.  
---
I dunno about you but i didn't bother with traders outside Deshaan and Craglorn at all until we got TTC. And even with TTC trading can be a hudge waste of time. I guess if you enjoy trading it may work for you but if you don't then it's just gonna be a very painful expirience. 
---
all the people talking about glorification ignore the major debuffs it would give the character when addicted and kids would very soon realize that it's not worth a -2 endurance all the time just for a minute of higher perception. it can be used as a tool to deter more than encourage 
---
So in the data files there actually is power armor "furniture" that goes mostly unused. I'm betting that would solve it but also a power armor stand would be cool. 
---
I think they should've kept the +1 Special for outfits, like in FO3 &amp; New Vegas. Maybe after a decent sized quest you could imbue an outfit with a special of your choosing?
---
You don't have a "two shot explosive bloodied" anything, because it's impossible to have that combination. 
---
I‚Äôve got a theory about d.c. in the future of 76. (Just a theory here). The last update on the 100 day road map (wastelanders),which very little information has actually been revealed other than ‚Äúour biggest and most ambitious update for 76‚Äù will be opening up the d.c. area. Coming to this by the fact that the map area of fallout 3 was called The Capitol Wasteland. On a second note that affirms this (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) some one on pc revealed finding a Chinese assault rifle file in the roots folders of 76, and the Chinese assault has only made an appearance in fallout 3 and the capitol waste. 
---
Isn't that, like, illegal?
---
Thanks for the info. I hope to find more.
---
I found glowing resin around on trees around the whitesprings service station 
---
I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs the statue they had in atom shop though...
---
Disconnects and camp building has alot of bugs now. Xbox 
---
I know fever blossom aren‚Äôt on the list but I used to have trouble finding them. There is some outside the church in point pleasant
---
It does not feel like I should have. I frequently ran into enemies that were way above my level. When I first arrived at Top of the World there was a level 40 Albino Rad Scorpion that completely destroyed me and I only got there with help of a friendly stranger. Today on my way to a Main Quest I ran into a level 50 Mirelurk Queen that I could barely hurt. So I don't think that I should have seen everything by now.
---
and that's how I lost my mistress face mask...
---
Yep before the latest patch the machineguns like minigun and MG42 only do 20 or so, 90 is really good already. 
---
I carry 3 different shotguns and every time I log on it removes one from my wheel and puts the other 2 in a different spot than what I had them in.
---
Yeah adding smoking would be more dangerous than anything else in this game I'm now thinking. Inevitably some players would smoke while taking a nap for the fully rested perk and burn their camp down. They may need to add a PSA on this issue if implemented. This is the 70's right? 
---
Seemed like that too, but possibly not a mule. I saw his inventory and he hardly had anything special like a new character would have. Maybe someone just wanted to restart the game, and I guess still counts as a low level player and worth helping, I guess.
---
I couldnt agree more about finding out the specifics but as you say the timescales vary greatly for the effects of both and I imagine there'd be huge bias to the reports released as well.
---
My understanding is that they did their best to ban anyone who got into the dev room and remove those items when they were found.  I feel like it's a lot more likely that people got the rare drops than all these dev room/Photoshop theories.
---
Yeah sure thing! Added ya, only have one left I can spare though! 
---
Hello and I play on Xbox. If anyone has the donut recipe plans and the baret. I would like to purchase them.  &lt;3   =^-^=   &lt;3
---
If you lose 1 robot you have a 15 percent chance to not get a mask. If you lose more than one you have a 50 percent chance to not get a mask. That is not a bug it is intentional. 
---
Why would someone go to the effort of photoshopping a rare mask into a screenshot?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGqZBdSZeKo
---
You can also talk to the protections there and they will give you some wood
---
No I'm on xbox
---
Yeah if they have alcohol distillery's, we may as well have cigarettes. I think a meth lab would be a nice addition.
---
The rare masks have a 1/1000 chance of dropping if all 5 bots survive. Keep trying!
---
No, the Tattered Mole's head should get that (Dolly Sods northern building, upstairs, behind locked door)
---
Remember the quest in FO3 where the reward was a mask that gave you automatic friendship status with ghouls? Ah, memories 
---
Hit these buildings on one run and you can pick up 40 or more geqrs at a time.
---
National isolated radio array
---
National radio astronomy research centre

Charleston capital building
---
Charleston herald
---
Vault tec university
---
These buildings are my favourite for gears screws and springs you just want to grab all the desk fans, globes, typewriters and clipboards you will be swamped in materials within no time.
---
Yes. Multiple of the same type of weapon in your inventory has various bugs with the weapon wheel like one item disappearing and pulling out the wrong weapon when selecting from it. I have the same issues.
---
"TSE Bloodied" is not a thing that exists
---
Excellent advice, thanks OP.
---
Which guns have skins? Is it just the lever?
---
Smoke a cigarette in real life. Graphics are great and it's far more realistic.
---
Im trying to figure out how i can do drugs, steal, murder, loot,  and blow a guys head off and turn into paste, but sexuality, or sex,  is frowned upon.  
---
Im grown damnit.
---
If they actually farmed it I guess they could do anything they wanted however how does one farm a stack of level 50 4* weapons all identical? 
---
How does one farm stacks of 3* BOS armor that‚Äôs rare in drops? 
---
There are plenty of higher level players that haven‚Äôt even gotten a dropped 3* TSE weapon yet from one place you can buy as many as you want? 
---
How‚Äôs that? 
---
If you took 200 high level players in the best armor with the best perks and fought the SBQ all day hopping servers, they still wouldn‚Äôt get that much even if you gave them a month. 
---
Whitesprings train station has the brick building set, I got mine there
---
Don't let the beauty of Appalachia or The Commonwealth fool you - it's a world of horror and heartbreak.
---
It's been less stable for me ever since Patch 7 on PC.  In comparison, the most stable period I've had with the game was the two weeks before Patch 7.  Far more crashes, disconnects, and general oddities.
---
The good ol‚Äô days. But just remember 16X the detail...
---
Did I miss it?
---
Can‚Äôt please em all
---
Great Point! No place in the suit to relieve yourself. Looking at you Bethesda?
---
You replied "mine do" to my comment about my TSE not one shotting...
---
That would imply you're talking about TSE.
---
I'm not advocating nerfing it to the ground, but having such high SPECIALs just seems a bit off in a Fallout game. True this is far from a traditional FO game, but still :-)
---
That one was fixed awhile back. 
---
Theres a beret that rarely drops. I've gotten about ten to 15 each of the 5 you listed and one beret. 
---
Its ridiculous.
---
Sadly, only lever, minigun and fatman, for now.. :-) This alone is reason enough for them to make more, IMO. I'd gladly buy more skins. 
---
Not only at Helvetia, often I can‚Äôt pick up any wood anywhere. Then it suddenly starts working. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever experienced the water problem though.
---
And there is the RobCo Research Facility on the map, so this is supported by the environment too.
---
Iirc there is actually in game lore saying that VTU kids would pop a bunch of mentats for studying for tests.
---
Same here
---
The rare masks don't actually drop. Any pics are from masks from the Dev room on PC. NOBODY has gotten the other 5.
---
I didn't get a mask. I'm bummed. 
---
I never play down there so thanks for that info. Had no idea. 
---
If you‚Äôre on with friends strategically place your camps in different areas and use Vault 76 as a hop point as well. 
---
Perk cards for travel will help and if you hit each factions vendors you would spend maybe 100 caps in travel but you made 1400
---
Yea, I get your point. But this is an MMO, some weird stuff is gonna happen, like that. Just wait for something crazier than unyielding. 
---
This would make sense.  It wouldn't magically appear in stores on the day the bombs fell.  It would need to be staged beforehand.
---
The terminal explained his mom worked at general atomics and the terminal said that it explained where he got it but not how.
---
Certain as hell my mom would not ruin her career and put herself in the sights of general atomics and the military by handing her son a robobrain so he could test drinks and create this shadow market of booze for soon to be vault Tec employees.
---
That's not the only problem. I did it three times in  row and every time no animals for the fetch quest have spawned. There were 20 people running around like maniacs to find a squirrel to kill and every time we ran out of time. This quest is buggy as hell.
---
Apparently the drop rates for the rare masks are bugged so it's like 0.03% chance. Which is obviously terrible and annoying.
---
You've got good RNG. I've server hopped several times and mostly get nothing. Sometimes there's a big pile of brahmin and a possum, and once I got the wise mothman. No deathclaws yet. ;_;
---
I think he/she was talking about excavator power armor. Nuka Quantum paint is for X-01 only.
---
No one asked for proof. You ARE on PC, right?

You got 4 masks, 4 free masks.  The same 4 I got.  Hey, I got 4 free masks!  Cool!

The OP is not blacklisted.  They person he mentions is.

Not in this thread, but they have elsewhere. And yes, I'm on PC.

Sun, goblin, jester, old man winter, skull

All are obtainable and I have personally seen all except the skull one. One guy was so excited to get the jester one he gave out a bunch of free stuff
---
If you have an assasin armor with appropriate minor perk its name is changed. Assassin + poison res = poisoner. Assassin + reduced fall damage = acrobat. Assassin + reduced dmg while sprinting = cavalier. Assassin + reduced dmg while standing still = sentinel. Assasin + ap refresh = powered. These are all prefix names of items thats in the game. If you see 'sentinel' in the name, you are guaranteed it has both assassin and dmg reducion when standing. Hope this helps. 
---
Hhmmmm i shire would like to know because that would make be lever super powerful!
---
This is what they totally missed when they went from single player to multiplayer format. People want to personalize their shit, give them personalities, so the experience is more enjoyable. And people are willing to pay for it. The default grungy look gets old real fast. After five months we got ONE skin for a lever action üòÇ 
---
I just emphatically agree with you
---
That's dope
---
0.03 is actually the drop rate thought for a lot of rare items including the traveling leather jacket. 
---
You just don‚Äôt know where the small animals spawn then. Everything doesn‚Äôt spawn on the road you actually have to look. Not telling you where the spawn location due to you trying to say it‚Äôs broken. Down vote me bois 
---
My Pa armor keeps duplicating since the last patch. Can't get rid of them fast enough
---
Well I mean one of the booze recipes takes fusion cells, and that‚Äôs radioactive energy. So you know, not far off from screws. *shrugs*
---
Oh yea I agree! Definitely someone‚Äôs alt. But just because they have great outfits that they got from their main doesn‚Äôt mean they have shit! When I start my melee alt he won‚Äôt have shit but caps because I have No lower level stuff left after gifting it to lower level guys. So besides my caps and a couple outfits it will be a legit low level with jack shit! Lol
---
Yea the same sledge is always unfavored 
---
Only had 1 or 2 disconnects. Mostly I just have the stutter but I play on pc. Has to do with the volumetric lighting sadly
---
Yep. Right at the part where the sloth was supposed to appear, we instead had another pack of wolves which kind of caught everyone by surprise. We ended up losing one of the bots and I didn't get a mask, but got plans for a decoration.
---
Honestly, if some are super rare it's best for them to not have mechanical effects. People are salty enough as it is 
---
All the important stuff has been said. Other than that, don‚Äôt feel too bad launching anywhere you feel like. That‚Äôs why they give everyone a warning. 
---
That might be a component of this post but that's not at all what he's asking. He's asking everyone to use their crappier guns because he'd prefer it. My TSE doesn't do significant damage to the high level legendaries he is talking about. This post is just hate crap and you're stretching it trying to make it realistic.
---
I think the better question is how in the hell does nuka grape remove radiation? Sounds like a miracle drink to me. 
---
So just think for a second, how come the only reports/pics have been from PC users? When we all know the Dev room was accessed on PC and most masks have been in the game since day one.
---
How come NOBODY on PS4 or Xbox is reporting any sightings?
---
I mean, I've got no reason to doubt that you saw one, I'm just confident it didn't drop from the parade...
---
The timer in the data is set at 30 minutes after the event ends.

If a fissure opens up after being nuked it shakes the ground for a large distance around it

Farm watoga for high level robots and farm west tech, but be warned west tech is hard
---
Thanks for the correction :)
---
No, players took pictures from the dev room with the masks lol. Dumbass.
---
Charisma effects exp and caps gained from group events. At one point it was on a loading screen in 76.
---
Gotta admit, I'd... "interact" with an assaultron.
---
As an aside, in FO4 I gave Curie an assaultron body with gatling laser hands. She was very aggressive. I remember her chasing a group of gunners, mowing them down as they ran screaming, trying in vain to get away. It was brilliant. And then there was the time she just opened the door on a roomful of raiders and blasted them all with her head laser. They didn't stand a chance.
---
Yea you need to aim up a little bit. 
---
Not the complaints I've heard. People say "there are no npcs!, it's half a game! It doesn't even work! Bethesda lied so I'll hate them until es6." I enjoy the game and look forward to it's growth, *shrug*.

It doesn't. Look under stats and you can see what they're at.

As well, items that would be unable to be dropped or scrapped, until unmarked. Can't tell you how many times in a flurry of action, while using and canceling out of VATS, I have mistakenly dropped a legendary piece of gear. Such dread.

if only.. Also i cant tell if ur joking or being serious. If ur being serious plz teech me the way

A nuke dropped south of the savage divide in Virginia

I think there was a grenade trap that one could disarm over and over, unless someome destroy it on that server.

Except for workshops people can't 'show up and kill you'. 
---
Has anyone manually figured out the code instead of going to the website or do people just use the website? 
---
I think you could get all sorts of legendary PA pieces in FO4. But yeah, that‚Äôd be nice for FO76. 
---
You can blow them out the vendors trade range with nukes. I think grenades work too.
---
I like the workshops and turning them into bases. You can adjust the height of foundations with walls attached to get that tarp/lean-to feel, and there are plenty of barbed wire type plans to unlock. What I need is someone to shoot the bmg over the heads of everyone who approaches my camp while yelling obscenities.

Also you only need to be a higher level than the enemy. Single random spawns are a myth according to the data. I don't know why everyone thinks that.
---
I mean, really.  If they are sitting there for minutes and minutes and you've made it apparent that you're there and waiting, give them a stab and start making a ruckus.  If they really are AFK, the sounds of combat should draw them back.
---
I got to 187 on my main mainly from just crafting and whitesprings. You used to be able to just mash Leather Left Arms for Steel and Leather with the runs for junk Id do it would be about 8 levels a day just from that. I havent played in about 2 months now, but I follow the sub to keep in touch with changes. I have no doubt in my mind theres people well over 1000 just to say they got there.
---
you‚Äôre right. I think it should be fair that when you move out of an apartment/house, it should be on you to clean the smoke smell out of the walls, carpets, etc.  
---
Oh you‚Äôre right‚Äî he‚Äôs my big big boss though, he gets what he wants unfortunately. He‚Äôll sometimes come into the job trailers still smoking... I don‚Äôt like him lol. 99% of smokers I have no problems with because they keep to themselves. 
---
No, pretty sure it was his level.
---
Been that way for a couple of patches.

But the thing is there are npcs.. rose for a example. And same I used to hate on it but not on Reddit just to friends till I actually played it. I‚Äôm enjoying tf out of it. Level 96 about to hit my 100

got glass shards, razorgrain, and corn?

Glass Shardonnay

They really should. Id really like a radio announcer at some point that would have different lines regarding the updates.
---
Couldnt smoke them in FO4 either until some mods changed that. Mods even made it so you could equip a lit cig and have it look like the character was smoking all the time haha
---
You‚Äôre right you‚Äôre right, we have a lot more smokers than we do mass-murders though... 
---
Well... we used to. 
---
I know that and I can assure you that the people were not just looking on the roads. We were looking high and low in the event radius. And I was looking at places where I have found animals before  but sure I guess you can tell with a 100% certainty that there are no bugs in this quest. I wish I was as cool and smart as you are.
---
Nuke mines/grenades cause rads which will eventually kill them 
---
I don't care I will report you if your rude. no need for your comment 
---
Took the words out of my mouth.
---
Bethesda is aware of it, but hasn't fixed it in two patches.  It has to do with having the same type of weapon with different Legendary prefixes.
---
I'm starting to wonder if they'll just award the 4 masks split throughout everyone who participated. That way it will keep it's scarcity, but give enough opportunity to collect them all through bartering. Probably not, but that or just having all of them available last day for everyone to go out grinding. I want those damn masks or the ability to burn that whole town to the goddamn ground (in the game. Sure the nice people who actually live there would help us get any mask or recipe we wanted. Like the goddamn sausage one that won't drop for me. 
---
I fucking hate Wes Tek. For some reason, supermutants are bullet sponges for me. I‚Äôll be luck to kill a few.

Not a whole lot going on up there for xp or monsters but there is a TON of violet. Especially if you have a group farming it all.

Harper's Ferry in the east was a Freestates town. The bunkers in the east give some more info about their fate

+1 found west of Lady Janet's, just past the bus to the west.
---
Agreed, I was just flora farming so having minimal enemies was nice.
---
Honestly, the bridge to far bit is probably right. Remember that in America it's okay for TV to show characters heads getting crushed with baseball bats, or people's skin getting torn from their back, ribs broken, and lungs pulled out. But the word "fuck"? That's too far!

That's essentially it.  We can't say with absolute certainty what's up with the others, but if it is possible at all, their odds are so improbable that even a player who engages the Fasnacht event constantly isn't likely to find one.
---
I‚Äôm almost embarrassed to admit this, but I don‚Äôt understand your question
---
Completely agree. Nothing better then having your guy light one up in GTA while just waiting for friends to do there thing. It just adds to the atmosphere. And like you said, we're all drug addicted, alcoholic, irradiated wastelanders any ways.

You can also go outside of town. Any critter carries the intestines. I usually have enough just by exploring to turn them in right away

Don‚Äôt forget the Mega sloth it get killed and stands up doesn‚Äôt drop anything 
---
I haven't had a cigarette in 9 months..the thought of having one playing fallout sounds kind of relaxing 
---
Also I might empathize a little... if it weren't for the fact that I have zero problem farming fasnacht on my lvl 8! I farm it about as much at 8 as on my 72 so yea, you can't aim and won't pay attention to where enemies spawn that's not on the people around you for slowly killing the sloth. If I have no problem in a crowd of tse wielding 130+s as a lvl 8 with a lvl 5 10mil, I have missed the sloth before but only because *I* wasn't in the right place and time, it was my fault. Take responsibility before demanding others change their behavior. It's *nice* to be nice to people and I am as much as possible in this game. But if you expect that guy over there you've never talked to before to hold your hand, tell you where to stand and when to shoot you're going to be sorely disappointed.

It was a valid question, its also the intended way to do it. Not mant do anymore because its so much easier. Especially when you have groups launching 3-9 a night.

Yeah let me download the screenshots from my ps4, I actually set one as a loading screen lol
---
There's also the special vendor bot near Charleston station, if lucky to make it spawn. Not sure wich faction.
---
I don't agree with many of these, personally. Not from a military point of view, but a game design point of view.

1) Smoke/Flash Grenades: I can see smoke grenades, maybe, but flash grenades are a terrible idea, because they are a terrible game mechanic. At best, you get white screened for a second or two. At worst, you get camera shake whiteout while the game blasts you with the most horrendous noise possible followed by disorientation for ten seconds. In either case, the meta becomes "one buddy tosses one every second while the rest of the squad murders the target," with a hefty dose of "lol trollz." If this was a pure PVP game, yeah, sure, but this is very much not one, and the troll value far outweighs the realism or immersion value.
---
2) Bandages: We have them. They're called Stim Packs and Healing Salves. A decorative swap is not really worth it, considering I doubt we'd get more than the traditional arm wrap animation as opposed to the injector animation or nonanimation.
---
3) T.E.N.T: Just use your CAMP. We have stationary bases out in the world, if you really want a mobile camp, nothing stopping you. Never mind the idea of specific auto-scrapping items to be used for repairs of another object. Remember when Hardened Mass auto-scrapped? Pepperridge Farm remembers.
---
4)CBRN/Gas Mask Overhaul: More things to grind and maintain in exchange for yet another means to get a mildly annoying debuff? Yes please! This is like the bandage idea, a overcomplicated decorative motif that adds nothing to actual gameplay but more grind. Alternatively, we crank up the penalty for illness/poison, so we can totally screw any player who happens across an area with that environment. I don't know about you, but I love the idea of a relaxing game of "shit, my last gas mask broke and I died in the middle of the cranberry forest, well, there goes my stuff."
---
5) Patrol Caps: Cool. Hopefully we'll see them in the Atom Shop eventually. Meanwhile, the green rag hat or field scribe hat is quite close (fairly sure the field scribe hat is deliberately so).
---
6) Carry the Fallen: Or, you know, spend .5s and just stim them like you would have done the moment you stopped making yourself a target to drag someone behind cover to do so. Another realism thing that does not make sense in the context of the current game.
---
7) CB Radios: Probably not worth the effort and resources. You can either use them for team communication (already in game), area communication on one channel (troll powers activate), or area communication with multiple channel (which never really gets used). Or, you know, just hop on the group Discord server and say "over" after each sentence for immersion.
---
8) Bunkers: ...? Not sure what you want here. A third sort of perma camp you have to take and hold (i.e, workshops)? Small dungeons to run? A third sort of placeable CAMP/TENT that's not really placeable?
---
It's great that you have this enthusiasm for a better game closer to your internal vision, but most of it is window dressing that would involve more effort on behalf of the already strained development team to implement and in some cases actively works against the stated goals of the game.  I'd much rather they focus on content, and wait for the eventual mod support so folks can make a million military realism mods for private servers.
---
There are some kind of charisma prerequisite for different type of taming? 
---
I wish that was the case. Those masks exist in the drop list for all the masks. The sun, old man winter, and old man summer masks that the bots wear are actually reskinned goblin masks
---
I've got no hard evidence, but there's two things that make me think that they are legitimate drops that over seen and not dev room items.
---
1) Bethesda was aware that people got into the dev room, there were bans, and we know they're capable of selectively removing items.  It would be reasonable for them to have also removed Fasnacht Masks when they did their downtime removal of duped items.
---
2) Bethesda has made statements confirming that the event is working as intended and that the rare masks have dropped.
---
So, even with Bethesda's track record of bugs, it makes very little sense that Bethesda would lie.  My take is that that so many people are believing the "bugged event" narrative because they want to believe that over the possibility that they probably were never intending everyone to be able to get the rare masks.
---
Did you remember to read the plan first. 
---
Nope it only cares about you having the perk level required which is usually 3
---
A what?
---
I use both, I have my 2 missile turrets on the highest point of my camp for better coverage then 2-3 heavy laser on the corners of the lower floor 
---
That's fair, haha.  But I still think it's more likely that they're super rare than Bethesda straight up lying about the event working as intended.  
---
If you want to message me on discord I'll show you all the evidence I have from the games data itself. 
---
What's your build?
---
üçº 
---
Sorry, if you want lung cancer you'll have to settle for breathing in radioactive dust. 
---
Really though, I always found it odd. I drink a ton of booze, shoot up morphine, pop some meth, and inject some pcp, but don't you dare light a cigarette or cigar. 
---
...a coward dies a thousand deaths
---
Assuming you get the right one, or don't remove the wrong one with radaway, or just keep every mutation you get. I'd rather spend the hour twenty total it would take for the caps farming.
---
Thank you very much I didn't know until now that you can tame guaranteed spawn, I thought only random spawn could be tamed
---
Some bitch ran through being chased by 3 scorched beasts                                                
---
!?!?!?!?!??!!?!? Why are you like this
---
I like that concept. I use workshops to gather resources at times when I need it. If someone owns it, I leave them be.
---
We should add watch towers with two variations for second and third floor styles and a spiral staircase case inside.
---
Usually, no need to sell anything for me. What i do opening the trade and closing it a few times.
---
Great, I must tell you though I don't own a mic 
---
What drop rate would be acceptable to you?
---
The current drop rate is allegedly 0.03% which would mean you'd theoretically have to do the event 3,333 times to get a rare mask once.
---
I know you posted this build months ago but you said if I had questions to ask them, so what mods would you equip on your power armor with this build in mind? Thanks lovin the build so far 
---
No problem, I have a few I run with that don‚Äôt; we got emotes üòÇ
---
I believe this indicates that WV was not hit as much by nukes.  
---
It's irrigated.
---
Great! Can't wait to join you fellas üòäüòä
---
Is the plan now listed as known in Phoenix's inventory?
---
Yes
---
Oh, I agree. Just saying it's a possibility. Also, not everyone that plays 76 is a redditor, so it's easily just as possible that those that have them aren't on here. Lots of possibilities.
---
r/market76  r/fo76bazaar
---
So it‚Äôs because of the rivers?
---
This weapon is janky as heck in VATS, crit or not. For the reason I basically only use it for scoping and hip-firing. 
---
Ok... I've also run it countless times. Given away recipes to plug gaps for other people. I'm as frustrated as everyone else, but it just starts to move into the realm of not being accessible rather that barely possible.
---
Guess I'll stockpile all the extras to sell later. It was a bit of fun that turned sour when it became clear that there was nothing you could do to achieve a rare mask...other than keep rolling the loaded dice...
---
Damn! Why do they have to do limited time items...
---
Usually, but not always, works for me with a melee weapon.  Might always work, but I have limited patience, so eventually I give up.
---
I believe they have dropped, and I've seen them, but since I'm on PC, my observations are apparently invalid, which is frustrating.
---
Fallout 4 had 2 main rivers too and everything was dead there too
---
Jesus, that's awful. Especially in an enclosed space like that. 
---
I got an explosive nocturnal Lmg.
---
Can I dibs the wetsuit plans? Lol
---
Reminds me of the Jimmy Neutron episode where they eat tiny books and know the entire story. 
---
Oh! I forgot about that tunnel. Never visited it. When i went to Watoga, i stayed on surface and followed the monorail, like that :
---

---
That is real shady for them to invite u to steam and do that
---
drinking doesn't just affect you either, drunk drivers kill tens of thousands of people every year, you've got to worry about drunk people's shenanigans including assault, rape, robbery, and even if you discount those possibilites you've got to worry about your own drunk friends, maybe they are passed out, now you've got to get them somewhere safe or whatever. Point is drinking is even *more* socially acceptable than smoking, yet is way more deadly to everyone else including non-drinkers, and even if it's not it's still something that affects you even if you don't partake. And once again drinking is portrayed in abundance in this game, while smoking is not. I understand where you're coming from, sort of, but your reasoning falls flat under even mild scrutiny 
---
Ooh I didn‚Äôt know they were affiliated. I thought the logo was just graffiti they had put before the war 
---
You would think the other bajillion odd online games with no text chat where no one uses their mic would've been a hint. They went through a giant kerfuffle around text chat on Elder Scrolls Online on the consoles, initially stating that adding text chat would "detract from the immersion" and "be impossible to implement." It has text chat now.
---
Everything.
---
If you can blow a guys head off and then consume his left over corpse.....i think we can allow cigerettes in game without further corrupting our yourh 
---
When you kill mole miners scrap their miner scrap it has gears in it
---
Miss my deathclaw mount!! 
---
Ha
---
I would buy a skins for all my legendary weapons right now if they existed, they are missing out :)
---
Probably so they don't haveta animate the smoking animation for 1st person
---
&gt;Not a single smoker I know *DOESN‚ÄôT* realize how incredibly bad it is for them and the people around them.
---
Addiction is a bitch. Especially when the thing you're addicted to is sold in every other shop on pretty much every street everywhere. I smoked 30/40 a day for about 12 years. Then I started waking up with pins and needles and numbness in my hands and feet. My doctor told me that's really fucking bad, obviously, and I needed drop cigarettes immediately. Fortunately, vaping had just become a thing around then so I switched over, and the benefits I felt physically after a month were incredible. 
---
And I'm not advocating for vaping, either. I wouldn't want my kids doing it, even though I do. No one has any idea how it could affect you later in life, hell it may even be worse. But if vaping was banned here tomorrow, there's absolutely no way I'd go back to smoking cigarettes. Not a chance. Now I've had the benefit of 5 years away from them, and there's nothing redeeming about them 
---
In fallout 4 there was already tons of nuculer waste in the rivers before the bombs droped that's why plants cant grow near the fallout 4 rivers
---
I appreciate it, thanks for sticking around!
---
Appalachia was spared most of the radiation and bombs. Out do the known places we get to see in FoUSAits the most diverse in land scape. DC was hit the hardest, the commonwealth is plagued by the glowing sea and the earthquakes and storms it brings. Mojave is a desert. 
---
Especially because cigarettes are no longer worth saving to sell to vendors, I remember in Fallout 3, NV and 4 how I‚Äôd hoard stacks upon stacks of cigarettes and get a good amount of caps for them.
---
My head cannon is that the robots use purified water and probably fertilizer to irrigate it.  There's plenty of places when the grass is green due to water, look around the junk yard, WS is just better maintained.  Running water is more likely to be cleaner as it's probably from submerged springs.
---
With a blue bear... found that one...
---
Because that would be considered a drugs and drugs are not allowed in the fallout universe, only chems.
---
How do you learn new recipes??
---
Relax dude it's probably more just "not implemented" than missing for some kind of moral reason. You can't read the burned books or juggle the mutfruits either :D
---
But they still are. Every few weeks I‚Äôll rack up a few hundred asbestos to sell. 
---
That one messed me up for a minute because I wasn‚Äôt expecting it 
---
Watch towers and bunkers would be kick ass!
---
Lewis was a taster as well, you find a tester note from him inside the plant 
---
Ive done that. I loves the views. Got xonfused when prize bot trackrd me down while I was up there lol.
---
But yeah with sneak you can get through the tunnel in a minute. Main reason my camp is near the east tunnel
---
not necessarily bunkers as in pre-made items but i just want the ability in the game to make an underground base, something that is deep in the earth instead of always making a house or tree house or stuff like that.
---
The options to make underground bases are pretty sparse with either using whatever large cracks in roads or mountains you find that you could possibly use to build in or the long-ass tunner north of watoga ...
---
Yeah but the vendor restock cooldown just makes selling stuff not really even worth it because your stuck hoarding stacks of asbestos.
---
there was a machine that gimme goods at first inside the bunker but now does nothing :sad:
---
Yeah 100%. I'll have to record it sometime soon so people know I'm not crazy!
---
ALL I WANT IS THE BOS SKIN FOR THE T-60 PA, I'M DYING HERE BETHESDA THROW ME A FREAKIN BONE HERE
---
Of course I did, and I also double-checked both my inventory and stash to see if it was there, just in case I transferred it instead of reading it.
---
One tip i don't know if others talked about it. The Farma Farmer perk in Luck. With just one or two levels, you can be swimming in stimpack, radaway and drugs, and sell thoses to vendors for caps.
---
At level 50, i decided to remove that perk because i always have too many stims. And if i ever need more, i would just put it back and go around Flatwoods and Morgantown airport.
---
Ahh plants and animals have no problem with radiation. Humans are the other story.
---
I dont deny it. 
---
I also know that abstenece isnt the key to immortality. 
---
If I could jump in a time machine and slap the butt out of 16 to me's hand I would but I can't. 
---
Meanwhile I do what I can to steer clear of non smokers when smoking and keep kids from seeing it, I dont do it indoors and I field strip my butts and pitch the filter in the trash if theres no ashtray around.
---
As for alcohol v cigarettes. I can't think of a single instance where overdosing on nicotine killed a group of bystanders. Not so for booze. 
---
I have probably turned in 20 technical data at this point and the best thing I‚Äôve ever gotten is a science scribe uniform
---
Hi There! Lewis gets around, check Nuka-Cola plant for his Lore :)
---
Sorry to hear about this. I hope support can help you.
---
As easy as it is to get so many other diseases and mutations, I think that everyone would get cancer after a few drags.  Then, game over man.  
---
Ill take your word for it. As I undersrand it, it always needed to be a random encounter creature. Are you saying it can be ANY kind of spawn?
---
Fast travel to your Camp, 76, and railroad stations. That's it.
---
It's not rare, it's unique ;D
---
I‚Äôm sure they pulled it for Atom store purchase.
---
Yeh it's crazy. Dying for that Jester mask. Would accept any. Accepted I'm not getting shit. But I still show up and grind. Definitely done it over 100 times. Nada. Lol
---
They have to willingly give it to you for free, or sell it to you for 0.
---
Don‚Äôt do that and your fine. Also always use a middle man when you can in high value trades.
---
Hopefully they will change it so there is a way to directly swap items in the trade menu.
---
Its all fun and games until they actually buy it lol
---
Happening on Xbox too. Just got disconnected a few mins ago... was in the middle of a SBQ fight with a  bunch of other people and the server stopped responding. That has been happening a bunch for me over the past couple of days, even when not fighting the SBQ. 
---
i would mention that the FO4 brotherhood seems to be rather discriminatory vs mutants 
---
Only the blue one is the rare one that people can't seem to get. The red one is an atom shop item and the other ones are common.
---
Nice dude :) and anyone who kills that will go to hell....
---
Which isn‚Äôt possible in the limited time available for the event.
---
Yup, just what every dude wants - a chick with a Death Laser for a mouth 
---
Maybe the radstorms blow from West Virginia from all the nukes we perpetually launch at fissure prime site.
---
Who knows, maybe to this day (in the fallout 4 timeline) in West Virginia, descendants from the vault 76 survivors still have to keep launching up nukes to keep the scorched plague to spread out.
---
Can you link a screenshot?
---
What was that cartoon episode, with the book gum that you chew and you‚Äôd instantly know the book. Was that a Jimmy Neutron episode? God it‚Äôs been so long
---
I personally am thankful the drop rate is so low. It makes something in the game actually rare. "I know there are other rare items" I couldn't care less about the masks, I'm having fun the the annual event. I'm hoping this is a trend and more seasonal events take place. Keep up the great work Bethesda!!! *Shit that last sentence is gonna get me down votes on the sub.... Oh well*
---
Nah, that's a separate depressing ranger tower.
---
The gauss rifle seems to always has issues with critic hits for me as well on PS4.
---
Same here man, it's really upsetting 
---
Right, so what would be an acceptable drop rate?
---
Aw damn, you beat me to it lol. But that was my exact thought too
---
I have been running as rifleman. 
---
Hope they make it safe!
---
When are we going to have an interactive sex minigame in a multiplayer game?
---
You know whats more ridiculous?  Logging in and ending up in a nuke zone... by the time you're fully loaded you are dead by radiation...
---
I'll take it, I'm just expressing my concern man, no need to hate on me for it.
---
In my option it's because wv wasn't hit with a straighten nuke and just received fallout and maybe neighboring explosions from miles away 
---
If you don‚Äôt care about wanted level you could slap damage kill them?
---
There's a second screenshot with the Black Devil Mask as well.
---
On the positive I got my last plan I couldn't seem to get which were the snowflakes. I still didn't actually get them. Random dropped them to me lol
---
They should at the very least show us drop rates above a 5% chance not a fucking .014
---
I honestly think a lock item feature could fix this and a handful of other problems. Make locked items undroppable, unsellable, undismantlable, and unviewable to other players when trading.
---
It‚Äôs a dark, shiny gray. It isn‚Äôt actually black, but it‚Äôs definitely closer than the Prototype paint.
---
&gt;re. A new quest, event, or even dungeon would be a pleasure to enjoy. Maybe we can find out what happened to the space station or what its initial plans were.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Please Bethesda, add more to the Crashed Space Station. It would be a missed opportunity if they did not.  
---
&gt;Thank you
---
toxic valley but i am pretty sure its on the map though
---
What plans increase it besides hardened receiver?
---
Just a heads up you should probably delete or edit the comment, there is usually a massive downvote wave on anyone that doesn‚Äôt bash me.
---
If you go to r/fo76guides I have a 63 Stash Route that I made
---
5% would be way too high.  Only having to do the event on average 20 times to get a rare mask?
---
I agree that the rarity of it is fine if it's intended. I remember farming the bos jumpsuit when it was still rare and still valuable. Until it got duped. Hopefully the same will not be true for these rare mask.
---
Not bad, I'm getting an excess of them lol, but hey congrats man
---
Yes. But only one particular log near where the suiciders spawn on the hill
---
Thanks! Ill do some exploring around the toxic valley tonight.
---
There was debate in the thread as to whether those were even valid examples of drops because players had been previously getting into the Dev Room and acquiring them. It was figured that the people who abused the dev room were banned, but items they seeded into the world by giving them away remained. At least one of the uncommon masks were admittedly given to them by a duper meaning that it's very likely that actually zero examples of uncommon/rare masks have been dropped legitimately.
---
I've done it 20 times. Rarest for me so far was the Beret.
---
Yup. He‚Äôs a good guy. 
---
I get that they're rare for a reason but it's impossible to get one of each or have enough in rotation with the timeframe the event has.
---
I didn't grab one at the time, was kind of caught off guard. but if he makes it home i'll snap one as soon as he gets here. I was doing the animal search south of Abbie's Bunker by the way, that's always been my go to spot to search for critters. 
---
I found the game on sale on Best Buy online, about 30 bucks when I got it
---
Ok, another rare one. I assumed there was only one picture. Sorry about that.
---
Haha cheers!
---
Every hour.
---
Yeah good point, but still to have it as low as it is, is still very insane
---
Huh, I got all the mutations as well, none of them decrease range damage from what I see, besides 13% accuracy which I can live with. I did just noticed my rifle is level 35, how much damage difference is that compared to a 45? Anyone know?
---
Actually, I never said that. I specifically stated quite the opposite when I said "I don't think it's so much that."
---
Seems you're getting me mixed up. I'm not the original person you replied to.
---
nice, can you post a pic of it?
---
I blame gases from fissure sites collecting in the atmosphere. 
---
Roger,I'll see if I can get one also. However did you have the perk card on?
---
Of course man,
---
It sucks man, I feel you, happened to me a few times too
---
...you're saying people shouldn't do things other people don't want.  Good luck with that.  
---
Oof, ok I‚Äôll keep a look out for that
---
I always carry around extra intestines ( I never thought I would say that)
---
Imma guess this is for late game enclave members. I just started and got access to the bunker.
---
just the standard taming set, animal friend and wasteland whisperer. 
---
There is cool mod for this in Fallout 4. LoL
---
I was literally just wondering if anyone does it the way the game intended instead of asking or getting it off a website. 
---
How is that rude?? lol
---
It's green NOW, but with every other vault dweller lobbing nukes it ain't going to stay that way.üòâ The OP is correct that FO4 is many shades of dirty brown and grey, but that's after radiation has buggered up pretty much everything. At the time of 76, stuff is still less munted than it's going to end up.
---
I'd recommend server hopping, reslly good chance of gettint them consecutively 
---
Roger,cheers.
---
When I do my run with Caps Collector and no BH I can make anywhere from 2-3k in Caps
---
Rarest for me is beret, donut, and the effigy
---
COme on ultracite skins!
---
1) Caps reset on a 20 hour timer, so plan a specific part of your gaming day to vendor. I personally sell things right before I usually wrap up and go to bed, as my sleep scheduled rarely variates by a whopping four hours.
---
2) Plant your CAMP in the middle of your range of motion. My lowbie also has one in the northern part of the savage divide because I am working on that area. My main has their camp to the south-east nearer to the cran bog. Fast travel to 76 or your camp, whichever is nearest, before moving on to your actual target location.
---
3) Plan ahead. I follow a path when on my vendor run where I hit each vendor, at a cost of less than 20 caps per jump (usually 10-15). If I have a target area, my line ends at the nearest vendor, otherwise I just do what's more efficient.
---
4) Specialize. I have the food/chem weight reduce perks, and I only loot food and chems indiscriminately, because I sell them all later. Pick one thing to vendor and specialize. When I don't have enough stuff, I get stuff, like making Healing Salve out in the forest.
---
5) You'll get better perks for this stuff eventually. There is one in CHA that makes fast travel cheaper, and another that improves sell price. Use them.
---
Dropped just now ! Elder. Her I come.
---
Whether not aiming manually results in one nuke in your face or six.
---
I may have some stuff, but I can't talk rn. could I contact you later?
---
my god; the only thing 'out of control' here is your misapprehensions regarding Fallout 76 PVP
---
Go to Biv‚Äôs and he might give you a quest to try out a new drink. I just got my first quest today. 
---
And the slap damage to be deleted o/
---
Yes! Here's hoping that they really do have duping sorted out.
---
Why? What would be the point of having a rare item when by the end of the week everyone would have one. 
---
Is bivs where the first mission was?
---
It exists if they're offering an item, but there's no way to remove a requested item; I had someone Request my main pistol that I use, so I set it at 25k hoping they'd get the hint. He declined it as 'too high' and requested it again. I canceled the trade, did a 'no' emoji, and sent another trade invite. This repeated a couple times before he started attacking me : /
---
We should definitely get the option to either set a caps offer or decline the request. 
---
Would you rather have a mask or have the chance of not even seeing one specific mask not even in the hands of anybody
---
Awesome! 
---
word up, sometimes it works haha
---
yayeet
---
yep
---
Only theyre like text books where you forget all the information in a matter minutes 
---
weapon condition
---
\+1
---
Caps are the means to acquiring all the plans and I like my CAMP pretty - plus more Caps = no worries fast travelling, taking over workshops, PvP... 
---
I'll do 1250 for the 3* heavy robot chest piece
---
I've had it glitch 2 out of the last 4 times.
---
Once, the bulb disappeared entirely, the second time, it wouldn't open or take any damage.
---
Not at all. People can PvP all they want. But respect people who don't want to PvP as any decent human being in the real world would
---
Grenades: I understand the idea of the grenades getting you caught in it too.
---
Bandages: Bandages can be made from cloth and is more bountiful than stimpaks. Not many will have stimpaks like crazy. 
---
T E.N.T.: But there are many players who don't want to move their camp because they set it up as a home. You have to understand this idea is to benefit many who play and need something that they can use on their travels from far away. That's where tools come into play. Some players become over encumbered. 
---
CBRN: I'm aware you wish for the game to be made simple but adding an idea where you have to change out filters can help out for a challenge. I'm not trying to make it that hard but make you survive in the wasteland. Gas mask should be able to be scrapped and have a filter populate in the process with other scrap.
---
Cadet Hat: Some players would like the many ideas of different head gear. I'm hoping for new content in the atomic shop.
---
Carry players: You run out of stimpaks, now what? You gonna let your team mate die in the field. Hell naw, I'm going to drag their ass away and stabilize them. This isn't the Commonwealth, this Appalachia. Welcome to the back woods of combat.
---
CB Radios: how about notifying info to others when you need to give it out. I'm aware that you could use discord but some people wouldn't like that. It's a hassle for some players. Just trying to make it easier but yeah guess communications is not needed.
---
Bunkers: You have some who want to hide away from the wasteland and have it as a safe house. That's also why C.A.M.P.s are being used as stationary for some players. I don't move my camp or want a bunker but it's to allow other players who do want it. Especially if you played New Vegas. 
---
Every idea I'm coming up with is to help out the community. I understand your pros and cons. I even talked to my battle buddy and he also gets the understanding you are putting out. We just discussed each response you said to me and then relayed the pro or con of your answer. Know that I'm not making the final outcome but the outcome between two soldiers who play video games.
---
Hope this has enlightened you since it has enlightened us at the same time. Also we enjoyed the discussion we had. 
---
Agi +2

Perc +2

Smokers Lung chance 4%

Western outfit, and western outfir with chaps, although good luck getting the 2nd.
---
Or, you know, rare, as opposed to "rare.". I remember old WoW had the Baron's Mount dropping at less than %1. Took literal years of effort for my friend to get it. But when you saw someone use it, you knew they had an actual, really fucking rare item.
---
Ahhh ok, that makes sense. Would like to see it as well if you have a pic around!
---
That sounds fair. Its a good piece I just prefer weight reduc armor. I can join you but you have to come to me because I'm over encumbered or you can join me @ ND Tactical
---
You will see the top 3 players on the server on the map. 
---
It would lead to childhood obesity.
---
You would expect the entire world to be covered in a nuclear radioactive dust cloud, making the life on the ground pretty damn hard. The amount of nukes dropped in the war would surely cause enough dust to block the sunlight for a while, the average temperature will drop, a lot of plant life would die. 
---
Well there's an easy answer to all of this. West Virginia has a massive force field around it, similar to the one in The Big Mountain Research and Development Center from New Vegas, but it also manages to keep out the radioactive dust. WV is so devoid of human life because nobody can enter the area anymore and we're all stuck inside it wtith the Scorched Beasts. On the bright side the SBQ can't escape either. Perhaps in a future DLC we'll be able to turn the force field down and we'll get human NPCs too.
---
You can find more info about this force field in the Enclave bunker. Look for entries about P.L.O.T. A.R.M.O.R. 
---
Super rare, unfortunately. Doubt any of us will see one.
---
It's almost like you're not supposed to get one of each or one at all. Hence rare. If everyone would get it then it's not rare. 
---
I think that's the masseuse they mention in the massage parlor. Check the terminals there.
---
Not as much as the sausage recipee from fasnatch...
---
its 2019, video game companies are held liable by investors
---
it's not about what you, the consumer, wants. and it's also not about what the company wants for the game. it's about money
---
Answer the question, Mandy!
---
My wife legitimately cried after listening to Major's first holotape on the bell tower in flatwoods. She said it was almost exactly the same as a situation she went through with her mother.

---
I'm also going to point out that you claim people are "stealing loot" from lower level players....
---
I'd make the case that you are "leeching loot" off high level players by tapping enemies they kill for you, a kill you maybe wouldn't have gotten otherwise, and thus loot you don't really deserve. 
---
O dont have imgur 
---
What level? If you have all the riflemen perks maxed, plus max sneak, covert operative and escape artist you should be able to stealth your way through getting headshots
---
Ikr because I tried to build a tower but I don't have enough space to make it happen. It needs to be a 1x1 or a 2x2 form.
---
The bunker would help out those who need to hide away.
---
I'd rather rare items be rare not "rare"
---
I took this theory to a new level. I've made a character specifically for Fasnacht; and leveled him solely through Fasnacht runs so I wouldn't taint his event item gain experience.
---
I tested Charisma first as it is the actual stat that effects rewards from events. With Charisma 1-10 the overall 'luck' was pretty trash, a lot of repeats on the more common stuff and no food recipes. Once I got to 11 charisma I noticed a frequency increase in the more 'uncommon' items from the current pool we can access. 
---
In Charisma 1-10 I got 1 beret, and 1 sausage recipe. From Charisma 11-15 I got 4 berets, 1 sausage, and 1 donut recipe. 
---
Once the character leveled charisma to max. I started leveling luck. I haven't seen any tangible difference in his drops. I'm hoping to get him to level 30 before tuesday to complete the test with additional runs to see. But the character is probably at about 50-60 runs so far. And a good 10-15 of those have been post maxing Charisma, which makes me feel like stats have some sway over your loot but not enough to sway the terrible coded chance for it to drop currently.
---
I agree. Would be cool.
---
Exactly, I get that but it's nearly impossible to get one. I know the guy on ps4 who got the old man winter. Just pure luck. The RNG is so insane its just a game of chance regardless on how many times you run the event. (He got his on his 12th run)
---
Im online now if you still want radways
---
80% of the times I‚Äôve seen Graham, he was walking eastward around Flatwoods.
---
found the post-modernist.  Reality matters, bro!
---
Wait what? What does the "top 3 players" mean? I'm very intrigued.
---
Thanks alot (can't take a break from What you haven't started lol)
---
How long did it take you? I want to see if there‚Äôs a possible pattern.
---
I was nuked my first run through
---
I'd say the servers are less stable due to the amount of players returning to give the game a second chance
---
Well it is also a game where you regularly use guns and the aim is pretty much to kill everything so...
---
That‚Äôs super shitty
---
Hmm. 5 days I think with a bbn out 30 avg deposits a day
---
I made a video about spike traps and what to do with them.
---

---
I sincerely hope that‚Äôs not the case. 
---
Super Mutants?
---
They should be. They havn't ever seen a single nice one. Only the ones that try to tear off your arms to stuff into a bloody bad for whatever reason. You don't kill them on sight? 
---
I like that concept to but know this the camp system has a cylinder shape that extends up to four stories high. So it would be four stories deep possibly. I want to have an underground capability too.
---
Thx
---
Not just you. Having tons of crashes, disconnects, the game randomly hangs up. 
---
I'm assuming that's due to how many server hops are happening for this new event... It didn't happen as often before the event so i'm hoping it'll get better when it ends.
---
Or mannequins to display our awesome apparel we‚Äôve gathered over many adventures
---
Its in the works. It can come with any patch, just look at the Radios in CAMPS i wasn't expecting that whatsoever and i love it.
---
They could have exploited events. I was told about one the other day that gave 350 exp per action which could be repeated over and over again rapidly in a short amount of time.
---
I personally don't see the point in doing stuff like that. Half the fun of the game is leveling to me.
---
I‚Äôve noticed it also this weekend on Xbox.. Couple of dc and lots of lag 
---
Just part of the game. For the 20 min time investment, should pay out more than one mask.
---
Your problem right
---
I haven't had any discounts in ages, but I have had a number of server not responding lately. My guess is the amount of people server hoping trying to farm Fasnacht and also over severelu encumbered high levels returning for the event.
---
There's something at that tall mountain peak behind you too!
---
Newb griefers, cool.
---
Damn. Welp time for my daily prayers to Godd Howard.
---
Yeah... oof
---
If you willingly give it for 0 how is that stealing? 
---
I stand here in real life smoking a cigarette while I read this. Yes indeed my character should be doing that right now too instead of sleeping in a bed.

The ammo factory does produce at different rates, when you're making 5.56 it makes multiple at a time and when you produce shotgun shells it makes 1 at time

The wire won‚Äôt connect to the traps is the problem I‚Äôm having

The game isnt for kids. Its rated M. The parents who buy these games for kids have the responsibility of deciding what their children are exposed to.

Thanks man. 
---
The Travel Agent perk will save you a ton of caps in the long run. White Knight, Fix It Good and Weapon Artisan will also help you save on repairing your gear by making armor cheaper to repair and double condition on all your gear (which means less buying screws/springs!). 
---
Avoid buying items like stimpaks/ammo - they are very plentiful in the world, and it's better to craft them or invest in luck perks to 'Search' their relevant containers. 
---
Pick up every lightweight item that sell for (relatively) high values, like chems. Also once you have a good stock of stimpaks, don't be afraid to sell them too! You'll always find more. 
---
For me, when I am exploring it helps me to make mental notes of the type of loot certain locations/enemies have, that way when I am short on something I can go back to them instead of buying the item from vendors. A good example is Yao Guai, excellent source of acid and springs. 
---
The brewing questline gives you a pretty hefty chunk of caps, if you haven't done it yet. I think it's around 400? Don't recall for certain. 
---
I think the biggest thing isn't about the vendor's caps, but cutting down things you are buying that you don't actually need to buy.
---

---
If you dangle the front of the trap off of an edge it connects no problem.  To connect the wire on a flat surface, just move the wire back and forth while clicking connect (X button, A button, E button etc.)  It should work, but you have to just keep clicking it and moving it back and forth.
---
Nothing in the entirety of my 35 years of playing video games has pissed me off more than that little girl in Metal Gear Solid 4 that won't get off Snake's back for wanting to smoke. Come on, the whole story is about how the guy has just a few days to live. Let the poor doomed guy trying to save the world have a drag every now and again!

Hmmü§î sounds like an interesting camp setup.

What platform are you playing on? If xbox I have over 150 of them that I never use, I can give you most if you want.

It also seems that in general if Monagah is powered up, then all types of ammo production is sped up.

I never had the wise mothman there. And yeah it takes me some server hops,i usually just watch sonething else while hopping. The last two claws died recently and it's much easier to find them.

I'd also like to point out that at least in FO3 cigarettes, cigars and the like are classed as "smokables" implying they intended you to be able to smoke them at some point and decided against it.

---
I've noticed that I crash frequently when using the scroll/favorite wheel items and moving.
---
If I am moving and hit 5 to drink a nuka cola I can crash. Sometimes in combat if I hit the wheel to change weapons, that's a crash.
---
It seems to be very focused on the favorited items in my experience since patch 7. 
---
fore sure I think they maybe they lost a bunch after the beta and the bad reviews started. The reviews were so wrong and I think just click bait because this game is awesome, but events with rare items like this kill it a little for me.
---
I lost all my junk to a group that did it today.  I spawned into town, and repeatedly died from RADIATION because I wasn't wearing my power armor when I stopped playing last time.
---
The joys of marsupial 
---
Because they expect to be given something back.
---
Like an item for item trade.
---
there s the Drink emote with the Beer why not a cigarette?
---
\+karma sorry thought you were someone else right away haha
---
Roger, roger.
---
Because smoking is bad for you. There is probably a law that prevents it from happening in the game. 
---
Needs a little more ingenuity than marsupial affords actually
---
Not really, how many rare items have people found in game, plenty even on day 1, these masks are pretty much never to drop. It's impossible to get over 3k run, and doing that is even like a 1% chance
---
But why is it unreasonable to expect people online, to not force others into unwanted activity? We wouldn't condone forcing unwanted behaviour on others in any other circumstance. 
---
"I don't want eat tomatoes as I don't personally enjoy it." "Tough, I'm going to shove tomatoes in your face and mouth constantly because that how I want to eat so you must engage with it too!!!!!"
---
... no! 
---
I managed to leave the vault. Still get disconnects every 20 mins or so - not as bad as The Division though. Took that game back to the shops the next day.
---
quit whining and dont engage in pvp
---
An actual auction house with auctions is the best option. Allow optional buyouts with a minimum 24hr timer. This allows 24 hrs for buyer to bid higher. The seller has the option to manuallly accept an offer before the 24 hrs is up.
---
If a seller wants to get a lot of offers, they don't have to set a buyout. If they want a quick sale, they can manually do so. This is especially good for selling resources like components and ammo. 24 hr buyouts will prevent bots from intsantly buying out underpriced items and flipping them.
---
just south of Abbie's Bunker in the mire, but i'd imagine any of the other "random event" spawn locations could work
---
[https://imgur.com/pFZtVxo](https://imgur.com/pFZtVxo)

That just seems risky AF, unless you know the other person.

Yes! The lag has been unreal since the last update. Not to mention event location marks have been all over the place.
---
He's the drunk robot in the speakeasy, so yes.

For sure, gotta watch your back out there, that‚Äôs why people like that can do things like that.

You should look do some research on a place called  Semey, Kazakhstan. Back between the 40s through the 80s it was a prime spot where the Soviets tested nuclear bombs - I believe over a hundred were dropped on the area, but I can‚Äôt quite recall the number. Just looking at the land you couldn‚Äôt tell that it had been bombed once, let alone dozens of times; everything is so lush and green. It looks perfectly normal. 
---
I found it in an episode of ‚ÄòDark Tourist‚Äô - helped explain a lot for me about Fallout‚Äôs scenery. 
---
Read that and was like wtf awesome
---
Are they actually coloured? I've found all the hats but only ever the weathered, dirty and clean version of the white outfit.
---
There‚Äôs more than that, like the hunting rifle
---
Honestly I dont see the issue. They can't do anything to you if you dont attack back. Especially if you have passive mode on then you definitely can't even be tricked into fighting em.
---
I've had some fun with the game, and agree that there was a lot of click bait slamming the game. But little things here and there over time have been adding up and the game is turning into more of a chore, at least for me.   
---
You have to 100% the mission. Meaning, your robots can‚Äôt take a pinch of damage. 
---
I don‚Äôt disagree with banning that either, lol. 
---
Never have really drank and don‚Äôt find the appeal. You‚Äôre right. Alcohol is far more deadly than smoking. You‚Äôre also right that media portraying alcohol so much is a root cause to it, too. 
---
This. Sooooo much this. Sub for bounty boards lmao. My kingdom to the OP for this idea.
---
Not the skeleton mask the Fasnacht Skull mask
---
was this on xbox? 
---
Ahhh ok. Sounds like a fun build idea.
---
Wish there was a way to mark the item even with the heart icon so that those hand made items wouldn‚Äôt be scrapped or at least ask you if you want to scrap them... done that before...lol
---
I got ovet 230 event plans and around 30 berets. So i think i have done the event 250+ times. And i feel hopeless... This 0.03% drop rate isn't rare. It is unobtainable. For me, rare means 0.2%-1%, not 0.03% and limited for a week.
---
And not the Halloween mask the Fasnacht Skull mask
---
My deathclaw had actually died once before, and respawned at my camp. Is this something that was changed recently? Or was the respawn a bug?
---
Stay strong, bro. That‚Äôs awesome you were able to kick it. 
---
If you pick up individual cigarettes from the world it plays a smoking sound effect and the cigarette is not added to your inventory.
---
But marsupial is a great help. What did you use to get up there other than marsupial 
---
I've heard suspicions, but has that been confirmed?
---
No idea 
---
mallet sledge
---
 candy cane walking cane
---
That would really not be a problem for me. I mean, english is not my language and on top of that, i'm sorta vocally shy. I even very rarely use a phone.
---
Oh, BTW, i'm not the same guy you've been replying to. My GT is easy, almost same as reddit. Just remove one of the "t" toward the end. 
---
I've nuked it. Its not worth it. Boring after the first nuke.
---
Now i just decline the event &amp; attack everyone the whole time. Im not into playing the lottery. 1 in 100k to win a rare mask... No thanks. 
---
Ill just farm the event for dummies who shoot me back or have pacifist off.
---
Usually my phone corrects AWAY from using ducking curse words. 
---
Exactly
---
There are like two, in the Brigg of the military wing 
---
You can't use them
---
Good for you! I like how considerate you are with smoking, and thank you for not littering everywhere too. I wish the smokers around me were more considerate. 
---
Absolutely not with booze. No way could anyone deny that. 
---
You can still (accidentally or not)scrap them just as easily though.
---
You just made me realize the loot mobs have is part of the environmental story telling. Damn.
---
BIG oof. 
---
There is a sub for bounties but nobody posts to it so I posted in the most wide reaching forum I could possibly think of.
---
I was lucky that I came across another Handmade Rifle. Also came across it's Plans at a Vendor so I wouldn't feel so bad if I scrapped again. Bit the Lever Action has evaded me so far.
---
I think the amount of people server hopping looking for tech data has increased substantially! 
---
Same thing with the XO-1 Nuka paint and the parade. 
---
Could be just a set limit daily overall.
---
Watch MAnyATrueNerd's Fallout 76 playthrough. He is an expert on Fallout, and most of what he did should still hold for you even after updates.
---
It's possible. Just just not possible to grind enough to guarantee you get one.
---
You‚Äôre right, they do have that *responsibility*. But we 1000% know that‚Äôs not the case. So many shitty parents out there that just let their kids do whatever... then wonder why their kids an entitled little psychopath. 
---
Exactly!!! That's basically what I'm getting at
---
Hey you want my Fasnacht Beret for 25k you got a deal
---
Jug
---
If I see one I‚Äôll let you know, if I randomly find one that spawns you can have it, I don‚Äôt use the lever actions. I‚Äôll dm you if I do. 
---
My friend saw it too pretty sure, if it was on xbox
---
I actually like things being rare enough that even dedicated grinding can't guarantee getting them.  
---
Should be able to get it at grafton station
---
Wow!   How long did that take?
---
probably the same floor trap with jet pack power armor the other guy used to get to the top of watoga tower
---
Yes, I get dc'd a lot. Last one was during the character creation screen on a new alt.
---
Slap them to death
---
Yes, much needed. üëç
---
Hey Ill be on for an hour or so did you want the recipe and the beret or caps?
---
&gt; and over-fortifying defenses with turrets.  
---
And why would you not fortify it?  You're basically saying it's not PVP unless someone can easily waltz in and take it from you. 
---
Bullshit. 
---
But when thousands of players are doing the event, a few people will get them. A few is enough. Not everyone needs to be a unicorn.
---
Wow, Thanks so much!
---
Glad I'll be finally able to use that .45 ammo I've been stockpiling.
---
I was thinking the same thing... Hope not though! 
---
That‚Äôs not how the game works. The only thing his level means in PvP is that he‚Äôll lose 312 caps if he dies in PvP. Other than that if he‚Äôs not properly geared for PvP or doesn‚Äôt have a good build then he‚Äôs just as likely to get wrecked as a level 50 player is likely to get wrecked.
---
Level is no advantage in PvP, only disadvantage as you lose more caps and would have to kill the other person more than they are killing you just to break even. Sure you can equip different cards, but not MORE cards, and you won‚Äôt be doing that in the middle of a fight with someone. 
---
Be on shortly just caps is fine
---
I bought the plans at Grafton station. 
---
After the last patch I get a d/c almost every play. 
---
How many im pretty low level
---
I gain the most XP when I just run around killing all the enemies camped around the map and loot their location. I consider myself to be in the right area when I'm seeing 100ish experience per kill.
---
Thanks, must take another look there!
---
Cool camp.
---
 Unrelated but bi-level houses are gross irl
---
Cheers, I'll need to make a stop off next time I'm close!
---
There‚Äôs definitely effects that could be applied to cigarettes. 
---
after lvl 50 u can decide to move 1 point or get 1 card...this is how u make builds ;)
---
Oh? They can buy back what we sell? Didn't know...
---
I had to server hop a few. 
---
Yeah last night I joined in on 2 dudes to help them launch a nuke and they hit right by the water park
---
That's fine for something you can actually work towards for a year. We have about a week for these 5 unique items; and nobody has any. Any legitimate ones, that we know of, that is.
---
Just break a camp. They are easy to find.
---
Thats how i get my bounty.
---
Is 200 too much?
---
Yup, some of mine were groupshots which can't be recreated
---
I'll do that also. Thanks for the Tip!
---
So everything after level 50 is basically a chance to tweak your build meaning if you are working towards a bloodied build then you may need to move points around and rank up certain cards to make your build that much stronger
---
Yes. I cant even get on at all today. 
---
Just a never ending load screen 
---
For that I'll throw in the beret and the recipe
---
Can confirm. Have the book. 
---
;)
---
It is not griefing. 
---
Go eat a bullet. It doesn't matter if I engage or not, even running pacifist, assholes like you can still kill with slap damage. I don't care about the pvp aspect. I still believe that when the new servers for pvp go live, they need to make it that if you are more than 10 or 15 levels above another person, you can't get squat from them. Once a character reaches level 50, obviously all bets are off, but before level 50, or even 45, it just means some asshole is only brave enough to attack people that have about as close to a 0% chance of killing them because of level, not skill. It is something people like you probably don't understand, but if there were protections in place to keep lowbies from being camped, or specifically hunted by assholes that are too chicken shit to go after people their own level or higher, I would consider running on the pvp server. I just can't stand pussies, and people like you are nothing but playground bullies, and internet tough guys that in real life are the biggest bunch of self serving pussies that are afraid to leave their parent's basement or their bedroom in their parent's home. 
---
Its fermented cow shit at least. 
---
You may need to come faster?
---
Lol, sorry. ;-)
---
Hey... I paid 500 dollars to get a look at my family tree... Turns out im a sap! 
---
Oh!
---
Any idea of his level?
---
I've been on and off using a beserker's handmade. To get your DMG up, basically just unequip all armor, and remove any perks that give you damage resistance. You can still have every resistance. I paired it with chameleon mutation, and it's actually quite fun to run around one shotting everything, but getting one shotted if you get seen.
---
Maybe they didnt want the effort to code it in
---
No it is not. WoW has much better AH than ESO, because ESO AH is pretty much RNG. You don't get full overview of market, you get only fractions. One sells item for 5k, other sells for 40k. First one is selling so low, because of lack of access to information and now one player out there is going to get item for 9 times lower the price it was worth and that's thanks to RnG. Meanwhile WoW AH provides everyone with same market, with same information. Means the prices are competitive.
---
ESO RnG bs will be a thing here too and outside trading forums will still be the true markets of F76.
---
Oh cool, my buddy was curious why up there and then realized flux farming lol
---
So once you reach max you get no more free cards from then on every level up you can use a point to unlock new cards. The special works in that if you have 9 strength special you can use 9 level 3 cards or 9 level 1 cards any combination that equals 9. You can also move a point from strength to agility in order to allow more cards in agility 
---
You know that out of the tens of thousands of players only like 10 people have gotten any of the masks right?
---
Are they rare? I think I scrapped one today.
---
Make mules. Cap limit is alread 125k
---
Then it beats the point of even participating to begin with 
---
That seems a bIt steep dude. 
---
Thanks 
---
That's how it works, yeah.  I think it's ballsy of Bethesda to do it this way, and I love it.
---
Around 150ish or so.
---
Not completely certain
---
No, I‚Äôm saying you shouldn‚Äôt have to rack up a 500 cap bounty just to contest a workshop. Just as much as you should be able to fortify your workshops, others should be able to break through your fortifications without racking up a bounty. People defended from workshops before by covering the workbench in stash boxes so the only way you could claim was by accepting a bounty. That‚Äôs technically an exploit. And that‚Äôs why you can contest anywhere within the build zone now.
---
And this goes both ways. There was nothing from stopping people from claiming workshops they didn‚Äôt intend to utilize and cover the workbench in stash boxes. Want to take over the munitions plant? Better be willing to drop 50 to claim and 110 for the bounty. How is that not abusing the mechanics?
---
Man I find it hilarious how some people here say that it's gonna ruin economy yet i'm sitting on 25k caps and i can't buy anything worth buying becuase apperently that's not nearly enough for most high-end items. Hell i saw a guy just a few hours ago selling full set of assasin/sentinel armors for 25k per piece! Most people are trading items for items because nobody serious wants caps. What is this economy are you people talking about?
---
If you never do anything where success isn't guaranteed then you're missing out on a lot I guess
---
Prolly give you cancer or something epic like that my guy.
---
*sobs with you as well*
---
Of alle the things mentioned getting smokes is the easiest, most likely thats the reason.
---
Sure you could get some kind of drug, but thats not really an "average joe/sephine" thing, the same as shooting up people, but everyone can just go out and get a smoke.
---
So its obvious the most "real" and easy to copy is not possible and im all for it. Smoking sucks.
---
While you may not be directing it at me, I do the opposite. All I'm saying is that it beats the purpose, or in other words, wasting time on false hopes.
---
jesus take it easy lmao
---
I, and others, have 100% the event and did not receive one
---
Unfortunately it is not that rare.  You may be able to sell it for 500c or so.
---
I'm not sure if it talks about it here but; https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b3rodl/inside_the_vault_survival_mode_beta_overview/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
It talks about the leaderboard for survival.
---
I e noticed this as well. I have 3 tech data‚Äôs in my inventory but I can‚Äôt put them in the BOS stash and the forbidden knowledge quest only comes up right when I get the data. If I leave the world or sever hop the quest disappears but I still have the data. 
---
Don't have to if ur immune to explosives :)
---
So getting a lot or backlash from the community, if anything they should be rebuilding what they lost and maybe should've ran the event at a later, more stable time.
---
‚ÄúHot Tub Incident‚Äù is stated
---
Well i cant say anything about it... Im exploding with rad/poison/electric more often than any robot ...so i have no problem with exploding mobs :P

They should still become wanted even if they‚Äôre in pacifist mode, then you and your buddy can ambush them and take their junk as revenge.
---
Did we ever actually figure out what was in deezers lemonade??
---
Something is amiss... 
---
If you can provide the materials I'm sure someone on here could craft you a rifle with any mods you wanted. If I were on Xbox I'd do it for free for you tbh :)
---
Did you auto generate one? I‚Äôve never seen one like it
---
Tbh cigarettes would be currency before caps would lol
---
thanks
---
Right on! ü§ò
---
I've been getting spans at my camp every couple days, usually 1 at 65 or 80. But the other day there were three. I server hopped. I can take down one, maybe two if a teammate is there but for three my camp will be trashed. And I don't want to have to repair the rad shower. Hard enough getting all the flux to build it.
---
No not this again lmao
---
It's not abusing anything. 
---
 If you don't want a bounty, then don't fuck with a workshop. 
---
Juicehead is good for any Fallout content.
---
The tunnel to residential may be the blown tunnel 
---
Nah i love Fasnacht Parade...so many cool people i met during this time  its unbelievable, Maybe because its ps4 community, but still farming stuff is just Fallout-ish :). I wouldn't rly enjoy this event if i can trade my masks for rare one. At this rate this event keep me occupied every hour.
---
Just joined a world join me. I'll be at the tattoo parlor. Gt:watchmefly420 
---
it took forever just for the owl  
---
and as far as i know its a normal mask...  
---
witch seems too often. got more of those than anything else  
---
got a soldier by luck, and a second beret.  
---
no dang effigy.  
---
only reason im still goin is 60 caps per event
---
seriously, the masks rng are ridiculous
---
I suspect that part is unrelated, but have no evidence either way
---
Agreed. I will not stand for this until I am allowed to shoot black tar heroin in this game /s
---
Good for you buddy? The quest still glitches out frequently. Not sure what your point is.
---
Yeah you gotta watch out where you log out -- have to CYA
---
When you select between the special attributes whatever you select first gets the point, and you can choose a card from a special other than the one you put the point in. It‚Äôs whatever you select first
---
I found one in a blue suitcase at Watoga train station. It was dropped by a high level player. It had a 200% condition bar and 18 damage resistance. So it‚Äôs most likely dropped by a high level player. I‚Äôve scrapped it and obtained the plan, and now I can craft it. I‚Äôve gifted a few for other players.  So if you come across one, please scrap it and spread the item. I‚Äôve confirmed it‚Äôs a legit obtainable item. So there‚Äôs no worries.
---
No. It happens to other players as well.
---
Thank you for posting this - I encountered my first glitched sloth today &amp; sure enough, waiting for it to go to meatpile allowed me to loot it!
---
I got like 10 of everything at this point. I'm Dyin.
---
Just to clarify, this is for Atom Shop skins, and doesn't apply to things like the BoS paintjobs for the T-60, or the Nuka paints for the T-51/X-01.
---
Idk, these power armor aint exactly rare things. I have 2 power armors and both of them are with me all the time. I don't see why I would want to store them in base or build more than 2 power armors.
---
Bethesda is going to see the shocking amount of people who love doing events with theoretical rewards and just stop adding them altogether. Why even bother coding them in to the drop list when so many are perfectly happy wasting days on end for nothing. Send out a staff member or two with one on so pictures get out there and voila! No need to actually make it obtainable!
---
Thanks for this!! Ill be doing that soon!
---
This patch took PC stability backwards
---
Of those 10, how many were proven to have actually dropped from the event?
---
Closer to 1/500 instead of 1/10000 seems reasonable to me.
---
Had 3 turn up at the same during a legendary run at whitesprings golf club.
---
You know, ‚Äòcos I wasn‚Äôt busy enough at the time lol.
---
After more than 80 runs I was done. 
---
But 'they are dropping as intended'.
---
They should make it so that when you smoke cigarettes your perception, charisma, and luck improves but when you don‚Äôt for a while those stats go down. Just like real life how cigarettes can calm people down, but without them they become a nervous wreck. Of course I‚Äôm 76 you can cure the addiction with addictol though. 
---
That‚Äôs what I assumed
---
You can add me. Shinigamigrlkj13. I usually get a lot of plans I already no and horde ammo that I can spare :)
---
I've argued that PVP should be removed completely from adventure mode when survival mode comes out. And yest that includes getting rid of the ability to contest workshops.  Want a workshop that's taken? There's a server out there where it's free for the taking. 
---
we couldnt finish, it took forever to get the intestines.  
---
we got to the last part and as he chanted BURN HIM BURN HIM BURN HIM, the timer hit 0.
---
It‚Äôs ok sweet pea I‚Äôm sure there will be plenty of things in life you don‚Äôt understand. You‚Äôll get used to it. 
---
I've only seen one legit drop myself, Old Man Winter.
---
Had three spamming me at my camp with their sonic BS. I logged off the server as quickly as I could.
---
Very nice
---
After that much time at least in other fallout games they would be stale and unsmokeqble in theory and in new vegas the cigarettes they smoked were from the same tobacco as the coyote chewing tobacco although i think 3 had some smokers and again same concept tobacco grown post war unless anyone has a better theory
---
No it was on ps4 today. Dunno about the other guy
---
Ha! Faults on my side.
---
Sorry, checking Reddit on my phone while doing some house repairs, leads to errors, I should probably wait until I'm done and turn off notifications!
---
Ugh! OK, that makes sense. I‚Äôve never stumbled on that before and I guess once I hit level 50 I can re-spec the points. This is my third build past with the two other past 50 and I guess I just never had that order of events. :(
---
It‚Äôs ok sweet pea there will be plenty of things in life you don‚Äôt understand. You‚Äôll get used to it. 
---
Does it prevent the robots from spawning? 
---
Ah, completely understandable :)
---
Well, there is the [Power armor display](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Power_armor_display) for Fallout 4 that came with the Contraptions Workshop DLC. Wouldn't think it would be too much trouble to drop it into Fallout 76.
---
either name it, or see whats connected to it.  
---
tired of having chassis with no idea whats attached.  
---
thats how i lost my ultracite, plopped it down and couldnt put it back in inventory since my level was low
---
they didnt become wanted :/
---
and it was my supply drop because i did manage to take 2 items and i didnt become wanted and it didnt say anything about the owner becoming hostile or anything
---
Would rather have an auction house then post on a forum outside of the game to sell my stuff
---
Typical? Oh wait its PC so i cant rly say, but those kind of things never happened to anyone in my team at ps4... My condolences rly if u weren't part of team 
---
Pretty much what it seems like right now, I only know of one confirmed drop, I've seen it in game myself so again, itself next to impossible.
---
Fists work just the same.
---
As of when I clocked out around 2AM EST, 38 times.  
---
All 4 of the accounts have done it an equal number of times, always at the same event.  
---
Trying to use my experience as a "control" as I can account for all factors (stats, engagement, etc)
---
I would love the ability to build a bunker/basement into my camp, like actually letting us have 1 layer into the ground instead of just building more levels on top and calling it a basement. 
---
Submitted a ticket. Hope they change it :)
---
Damn sorry forgot to get it from stash box. Brb
---
yep, there is atleast one screenshot out there of it spawning on a helmet spawn point. Thing is it is rare as hell.
---
Exactly. Like I said I never take a workshop that's already taken, it's not difficult and means people can choose to play peacefully. Lets hope Bethesda splits the gameplay modes
---
Highest I've seen was a 450 something. That was around 2-3 months ago though...
---
I haven't even seen a level 300 though.
---
If this happens, fast travel away and back 
---
The sloth should be a meat pile and lootable 
---
West Tek and the surrounding satellite arrays 
---
Just because the files says that in that part of code,doesn't mean it's exactly how it works. There is actually no proof of anyone taming anything outiside events spots. If this was true there would be someone showing it,wouldn't it?
---
So.... What if the point of the whole thing wasn't to get the rare items? Maybe the main point was to have a fun co-op experience, and the rare masks are just a bonus for a very few lucky people?
---
Mike miners drop something that has gears in them, I usually have at least 60 after clearing it.
---
That got a genuine laugh out of me, well done.
---
Actually it is how it works because those are the conditions needed for the pacify/tame magic effect to be cast on the target. 
---
On the plus side, you weren't going to win that one anyway.
---
You can feel the edge here.
---
I get your standpoint but if thats the case then the event shouldn't be limited time. I'm not here ro argue over this, I'm just expressing my concerns about the low amounts of players stopping with the event altogether.
---
*shrug*  
---
Personally ambivalent, other Online games have done it, with mixed results.  
---
Tokens only take away the excitement of a random reward, the problem here (in my opinion) is Bethesda's made it almost Binary. Get Super rare or not, no middle ground (uncommon, rare, super rare). 
---
If it was tokens and also random rewards it could be the best of both worlds..
---
Keep 2 masks as super rare for example, it's possible to get them, just hard, and keep the token price very very high, but doable for a nut, for the ultra rare version, but more reasonable for the uncommon and commons... But just spitballing 
---
Currently they do not serve any other purpose other than being part of the main quest line plot. You can't join a faction or get special stuff from them. There are rewards from doing faction quests but you don't build karma with them, chose a faction or anything like that. I guess you could say one faction leads to silo access for launching Nukes, but not really.
---
When I first heard about factions I thought we'd get something similar to New Vegas, and maybe we will one day.
---
+karma 
---
What he said, plus you get a bunch of steel from it
---
Yes, exactly. Got it in one. 
---
I would love to see this arena
---
I know on desktop you don't need an account to upload but on Android, you can sign in with email/google/FB to upload 
---
You see, thanks to so much hate targeting this game, community not only at PC but also PS4 is awesome... its kinda hard to find asshole here. Well during my nearly 200h never encountered any... you know how it is... treat ppl like u would get treated :)
---
There's actually one paint for each rank of BoS member Initiate&gt; Knight&gt; CPT Knight&gt; Paladin&gt; Sentinal &gt;Elder. 
---
I  really want the Elder or Officer one, whichever as they're a darker grey than the default with red highlights.
---
As of right now if you have pacifist mode on you can be damaged by slap damage. I know this because it just happened to me. If you respond, you get a message about being in pacifist mode and not doing any damage. I run this way since I use explosive ammo and don't want to hurt others during events. Eventually they will do away with the slap damage for the non pvp servers. What I am talking about is for those that run pvp in lower levels, BGS should do something to discourage people from hunting players more than 10 or 20 levels lower than themselves. Obviously, if a lower leveled player attacks a higher player, all bets are off. They already provide protection for players under level 5, all I am saying is if they want to get more people playing pvp, then they need to encourage them by making sure people that are afraid to attack others their own level don't get rich by attacking people way to low to stand a chance against the attackers. 
---
That‚Äôs weird because you have to lick the lock to open it and it definitely makes you wanted if you‚Äôre not the owner, sounds like a bug or something idk
---
Don't apologize, thanks for taking the time to post a suggestion, it's why I make these roundup, get input, bugs and opinions from the community.
---
I've seen a bunch of people in game with usernames that are all jargon, just random numbers and letters, so it's a bug then, huh. 
---
I'm on Xbox 2 characters 1 a lvl 145 the other 95 Gt is warrus add me I have helped some of my friends to lvl up join us
---
:/
---
Between the water park and housing for water park trailers are like 3. 
---
That's a great idea and I'm enjoying it more and more. Kinda like a storage room maybe.
---
he made it home, added the image to the first post. 
---
I had a guy blow up me and my camp because I ‚Äútook his spot‚Äù but yeah. Except for him, no assholes
---
No judgement (because I use them) any mods installed?   
---
A couple have been known to cause problems when NPCs spawn, possibly made worse by the number of people participating in the event.
---
I've turned in well over 50 and I've gotten a few things, T-60 Initiat paint twice, Bomber jacket (3x) and various scribe gear. The bomber jacket is pretty cool. it's the Brotherhood underarmour with an aviator style bomber jacket on top.

---
I mean ffs they put packs of smokes in the Medical vending machine!
---
Lemme blacken my lungs like my heart Bethesda!!
---
It wasn't the floor trap. It was a combination of jetpacking, and placing more power armour down on the ridges of that spire to form sort of checkpoints to allow higher flight.
---
Every instance that I have heard of was "I saw someone wearing" which is not necessarily the same as having been demonstrated to have dropped from the event.  Due to the way Beth has handled things thus far, it is reasonable to assume some masks taken from the dev room and duped (if there were any) could have been missed in a sweep to remove said items from game.  This causes all "confirmed" masks to be suspect without supporting evidence (screenshot) that they actually dropped from the event.  Which platform are you on?  While I haven't done extensive research, I haven't heard about on on consoles yet.
---
Great name üëç
---
Oh men.... nah i cant talk about PC, but at ps4 we are cool... :3 damn thanks to my melee build i even donate every single ammo piece to newbies, same as water or whatever.... im a walking talking charity :P
---
Drop me a PM when you want to trade 
---
Oh dont get me wrong I very much so enjoy this event, the robots shoot confetti at enemies and it's my favorite thing, but when you do it 50+ times I feel like you deserve more than your 15th owl mask ;-; 
---
It's a responder bot.
---
Usually I just tell people to stop complaining in the these posts, often followed by comments about respecting other people‚Äôs right to play in whatever manor they seem fit.
---
But this, this I couldn‚Äôt agree with more.
---
Sorry man I‚Äôm not on rn what time
---
 Zone are you on
---
Good idea! But that cable management though...
---
Glad we see eye to eye XD
---
yeah, just 1 foundation level lower than the ground so you don't have people tunneling through the earth. would be a real cool place to put the crafting stations and such. 
---
I can see cigars cigarettes and pipes to be a thing. As far as an in-game mechanic have it slow down hunger meter for 2 minutes accompanied with a smoking animation for that duration. Chance of additiction simialr to alcohol.
---
A simple fix would be to have lighting up and blowing smoke rings to be a photo pose. They have sparklers and planting a flag so why not?
---
Well yeh, too bad all RPG (YES F76 is also one -cough) works on RNG... too bad RNG basically mean you can get rarest stuff with 1 hit or you can never see it too... I learned this in hard way trying to get my shield skin in WoW, when i still cared about WoW. What can i say ..Keep going bro and u will get it. Event have no end date so there is still chance... unless this drop is bugged :P
---
Plants do tho
---
I've encountered a three-some in the bog.
---
Unsat!
---
If you enjoy a good rng filled grind, then this game is perfect for you. As silly as it may sound, I love games like that and thus I love 76 a lot. However, 76s pvp is quite fun if you‚Äôre into that and there‚Äôs someone willing to pvp as well. I suggest you try it out though don‚Äôt expect it to be like fo4 at all really
---
I got the effigy bonfire on my 29th run and I saw a reddit post saying someone got 2 in 60 try‚Äôs so it must be a slightly more rare camp plan but good luck, hope you get one soon
---
1.PC or PS4
---
2. Did u played F3-4? Did you liked it?   
---
3. in F76 u will have a lot to do in first 150-200h 
---
4. and most important question ...do u play with team or pure solo
---
Event ends in a few days.
---
About an hour until I worked out my method. I could do it in 15 minutes now I've worked it out 
---
This is actually collaboration candle between ‚ÄúKeep On Creepin On‚Äù and ‚ÄúCasey‚Äôs Cauldron.‚Äù Casey designed and handmade the candles and Liz designed the art, which looks awesome.  The candle is 100% soy wax, scented with sage, black pepper and redwood.
---
You can check out that candle as well as other candles here [Casey‚Äôs Cauldron ](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Kcscauldron) .
---
&gt; my religion/life philosophy is based off of
---
Ah, that must be exhausting
---
In principle I agree, if the reward system functioned more like other online games where there is a broader spread...  
---
-Common  
---
-Uncommon  
---
-Rare  
---
-Super Rare  
---
There are even enough masks to make that work....  
---
Or if only 2 or 3 were locked behind a rare, and the other 4 were very uncommon (one out of every twenty events uncommon).  
---
But it clearly sours the community a bit when more than half the possible masks are locked behind a PowerBall level of RNG.
---
Why shouldn't it be a limited time? It being seasonal is what makes it feel special to me.
---
And I'm not trying to attack you or argue. I am trying to help people see another perspective because I'm having a lot of fun with the event and I wish more people could enjoy it as much as I am
---
Thus seems reasonable assumption 
---
That is pointless. This is not Runescape where you go to Varrok and spam "WTS lobbies, 450gp ea". Even if all players of the server came same location to trade their things, it would be still more beneficial browse outside the game forums, because 26 players from 2000-3000 online players, is what 3-4%? 3% of traders you are getting access to only, that is way too low.
---
You can find it at thunder mountain power plant in a fixed 100% drop in the tents outside. I scrap these all the time 
---
Ok dumb question. Never tamed anything. Just saw someone got an attack dog. When people say random encounter it has to be on one of those special spawn spots? Has someone made a map of where I can check for said animals?
---
Is there some trial we can play to try it out? Yeah I don't expect it to be like FO4 but I do like the universe. I dig ESO (elder scrolls online) and that doesn't play like the solo games at all.
---
...OH SHIT! need to farm then...
---
I have some incendiary migration that does this, do you? Scared the crap outta me, now it's kinda funny although I have died from it a few times.  
---
I was hoping that different players could join different factions and like do quests for them and stuff, or maybe something like a guild/clan system 
---
There is difference between the way drugs are used in game and actually showing the act. They don't show you shooting up med x or inhaling jet. It is just a consumable item in your inventory that you may or may not use. They arent glorifying it, it is simply an option and you have to choose that option and decide if it's worth it. On the other hand being able to visually see a cigarette being smoked in game just for the aesthetic value, even if it had a negative effect,  would be glorifying the act. 
---
1. PC player here
---
2. I played 4 and luved it \^\_\^
---
3. Honestly would probably do solo like I'm used to ( I play ESO solo and love it), but I do want to take advantage of multiplayer when it arises. That being said I'm aware that there are no NPCs so I don't know how lonely a solo experience here would be
---
It's also at the Ash Heap vendors (Camden, Welch, Lewisburg) if you're hanging around there. The plan's always there so you don't need to server hop. Just need to acquire enough caps.
---
Good luck getting an NV scope plan though. Those are almost impossible to find now.
---
True...
---
Vatsbuild = more dmg 
---
With the right perception cards
---
 Vendors are good for easy caps. I have found that cap stashes are the best for making a good amount in a short time.  Fortune finder and 3 cap collector. They are instanced so you can only do them once a day and im seeing issues with them resetting a bit but i make most of my caps along a farm route i found of cap stashes.   Best way i have found aside from vendors
---
So this hairstyle isn't available again huh? Ugh
---
I miss "Way Back Home", it was always my favorite Fallout exploration song. I remember back to Fallout 3 trudging through a radiation filled sewer being swarmed by Ghouls with this playing over GNR and nothing has felt like a more appropriate tune to commemorate the Fallout experience like it. 
---
Yes. I enjoy it tremendously
---
Yeah man I wouldnt have any problem if it was something I could grind every day. Ya boi has no problem farming for shit that's super rare but this time table we on makes it less chill. 
---
wow, having to wait 3 minutes or more? are you kidding me ?
---
I've spent more time scrolling through UI/Menu options trying to sell stuff and sorry, but sometimes real life is just that little bit more important than a bloody video game.
---
THANK YOU
---
WTF, just try to take it a power plant and couldn't cuz the scorched and Laser turrets kept on full regenerating health. Quest ended up timing out because of it. Bethesda this is game-breaking fix it now!
---
Funny,  my camp was there at one point
---
HOLY SHIT I ALMOST CRIED ON THIS
---
Eastern ...i work 12 hour shifts usually on in early morning but on days off play all day...lol
---
Oh I see, you didn't have a point. Must suck getting used to be worthless. 
---
Kinda remember there bein this big no smoking push in the early fallout games and games released around that time that stuck...
---
I'm aware of the 15% chance to not get the mask, and my personal sample size is too low to be truly effective, but it's sitting at about 20%.   
---
That 20% unfortunately represents some mixed data from both zero losses and 1 lost robot.
---
The more important bit was the healthy percentage when there are zero lost robots no reward is also given.   
---
Steins are instanced, in a different way than the wax. 
---
Stay on one world for 2+ of the events, after fully looting all the steins you will not be able to loot them again with the same character, and in some cases cannot after server hopping either, only sure way is logging out completely for a bit and coming back in.
---
You have to activate the camp fire
---
Your thread needs more upvoting for awesomeness 
---
I'm not sure if you can do anything about the crash, but you can pick up the thread of the quest line without completing the final exam. Just go anywhere near Top of the World, IIRC.
---
Isn't there only one vats card? Regardless..make sure u max all 3 rifle cards
---
I don‚Äôt know of any trial sadly
---
The animation is in FO4, a lot of the NPCs smoke. Would be an interesting mechanic in 76, could give you a small decrease in health and maybe an addiction withdrawal effect like alcohol.
---
I gotta say, I have been helped out several times myself. Just now level 32, and I always try to pay it forward as well. I have been gaming for a long time, and believe it or not, this is the 1st online multiplayer title that I have enjoyed playing. This community rocks!!!
---
As a workshop owner, I think you should be able to take out those turrets and walls and whatnot without incurring a bounty, IF you do a full contest for the workshop and win. I also think once you start contesting the workshop, you should not be able to back out even if you kill me, so you can't farm me for caps by contesting it over and over and backing out each time I die. That is cheating. 
---
It would and it helps out when you are limited in space for your location.
---
There are no NPCs? Wot about ROSE?  Please... there are a lot of NPC but they are kinda robots.... xD
---
Sadly i cant say a lot about PC community, if u ever play on PS4 i can help with anything from lvling to hunting glowing deathclaws.. 
---
After you unlock / encounter everything (150-200h) game can get tedious... a bit. But then we will have group raids etc, so there always be people looking for team members
---
Rifle+Vats=Love
---
Way easier to aim for weakspots with vats. Fallout mobs are always so twitchy, it's nearly impossible to aim for their heads while they're running. This is just one of the many benefits of going vats rifle
---
Also, no reason not to go rifle+vats. All rifle perks you need are in perception, vats is on luck. 
---
Wellington real life they increase focus and alertness slightly and reduce hunger significantly..
---
The Abandoned Waste Dump in The Mire, the one for The Enclave, always has at least two Deathclaws every time you log into a world. Three if you‚Äôre partied with another person. I spent a couple hours server hoping there a few months ago and haven‚Äôt been wanting for gears since. 
---
Brutal 
---
"Lately".. As in like.. since launch?
---
One is in The Mire, north of Threetop, on the road near/past railroad bridge. It spawns different random encounters, not all are with tameable monsters. 
---
:O
---
yeah but its different when its a person inconveniencing you, that could be easily avoided if someone just didnt go afk while in a shop menu. Also whats so hard about pressing escape before you leave for a real life deed? I literally fail to understand how any sane person can disagree with my point. Its literally like disagreeing that gravity exists. 
---
I've been done with it but my friends are still after the plans
---
Where you people finding this kind of things ... my last leg was 3 star hammer, with fast swing and scorched killer thing...and that was best thing i got in nearly 200h of gameplay
---
Oh, thank you. If I can't get this crash resolved, I'll head there and continue on.
---
it's been my go to spot for pet hunting, you spawn into the game really close to it and there is 1-3 wendigo along the way which is a great spot for screw farming. 
---
The game is a lot of fun in its current state.  
---
What is the stronger monster you can have... and what level...
---
Sniper BOS character idea
---
Your showing as offline
---
Curious, know how many of the hats you got? In all of mine I'm sitting at 4...   
---
Got a couple serums today and I really appreciate the help. Easy friendly player.
---
exactly, I don't want to have to build a 9 story building just to be able to fit more stuff. 
---
 Not sure how it‚Äôs possible. But I was playing in one session and happened to be fast traveling. I saw a player that was over a thousand level. Maybe it was a glitch or something, not sure, but it was like 1016 level.
---
Thanks, that‚Äôs kind of you to say and I‚Äôm happy to help. 
---
wow this keeps happening to me ...especially today had 3 crashes in 2 hours and lost all my lot as I recently died, this is very frustrating
---
I use a short recon sight on a hunting rifle and I think I do better without VATS. 
---
Im in when ur ready
---
Hey, so if you still want to team up my PSN is shadowman9908, unfortunately right now im at work so i'll send you a request when im back home. 
---
I don't really believe it's a morality thing, because when you pick up a cigarette or cigar, it makes a smoking sound. 
---
What would the effects of a cigarette be? It would kill any adrenaline buff you got. It's not like the player experiences berserk or frenzy, or any status effect that would benefit from smoking. 
---
Added status effect, chance of sludge lung.
---
People are still running around in backpacks, the didn‚Äôt get rid of any of the items that came out of the dev room if they were traded.
---
I‚Äôm currently level 119 and use stealth to my advantage. I‚Äôve got chameleon gear and my rifle has a vats critical shot buff as well as having better hit percentage in vats.  
---
My profile should be open now.
---
Good data...  
---
Really reinforcing CHA as the stat for helping with better drops. 
---
One of my characters has 15 CHA, one 13 CHA, one 3 CHA and the last has a 1 CHA.  
---
My primary (3 CHA) and the 1 CHA alt have both gotten one donut and zero berets, the higher CHA have netted the 4 Berets in my total, and the rest of the food recipes.

Funny thing is, server hopping is has apparently been changed such that you end up in the same place. I have noticed this, after a crash, I log back in and find that a place I‚Äôve looted is in the same state, enemies in the same place.
---
That‚Äôs my experience but I got that from a fo76 youtuber. Could be wrong though.
---
I guess. Maybe Bethesda has an answer
---
That's fair.  I'm definitely not trying up say it's a perfect event. Adding middle ground rarity could be great.
---
But so many people are saying it's out right broken or a waste of time that I am trying to push back against the narrative that everyone hates it.  I'm having so much fun, I want to try to share my perspective so that maybe others will relax a bit and have fun too
---
Seeing as the taming feature seems to be half done I think we should wait. But I want it as well, and we know it is coming in the future from a tease on the road map. 
---
yea they should introduce something like "Buy Special Ammo" with caps from vendor that has high quantity or something else, that endgame players would constantly use, so that there would be them to somehow deplete their caps stash and then create them for need to sell items rather than trade.
---
PSN is shadowman9908,im more than happy to team up, even started a new character earlier today.  
---
Hit me up with a request and i'll accept it as soon as im back from work.
---
Along with SOP's for ever darn thing you pick up, hopefully it'll get noobs on guard duty to not muzzle themselves at the gate IRL! Pay attention to incoming  flash instead of talking to your buddy about 76 and holding the line.
---
: Rant
---
Yeah but they dont place it themselves
---
Just saying I run unyielding build with 8 base luck and ran soon 70 events with 23+ luck. Nothing.
---
I haven't seen any of that, but I'll take your word for it.  
---
Why would Bethesda say that they're dropping if they aren't though?
---
Would do it but highest lvl player I know I can take is around 80-85 (im 54) sorry vro. 
---
yeah i agree. everytime someone does a trade invite they always want my IE Combat Shotgun or Instigating Super Sledge. which pretty much leads to them not wanting to trade at all when i deny the trade.
---
Think it‚Äôs Workbench-oriented, since they pulled so heavy from 4?
---
Sounds good! Just waiting for the update to finish.
---
Begin farming screws now haha. You need 10 screws to craft a flamer, which is a lot if you just want the fuel.
---
Omw
---
Challenge is not the same as complexity. Swapping out gas mask filters is not more challenging, just more complex. There is no need to carry another player, because you can literally use the revive stim faster than you can lift them up and carry them over to cover where you'd do the exact same thing to revive them. CB radio is literally team comms, or area comms, or a global channel in game design terms.
---
The problem is not that the ideas are without their place in gaming, but that your ideas are impractical for this particular game's design.
---
Imagine this: You're making a FPS PVP game, and you make a medic class. You open an real life emergency medical kit and start designing the class around it. (example contents from a civvy side on this, as I am not a member of the armed forces) "Okay, Alcohol swabs can disinfect. Pain meds to give temporary HP. Absorbent pads to stop bleeding. Split to hold broken bones in place. Gauze to work around small wounds. Bandages for minor cuts. Anti-burn cream." All of these could be their own items for added realism, but that also means added workload and added complexity without adding challenge. You don't need "heals burns" and "Heals broken limbs" and "reduced pain," and so on, because in game terms, it's all one thing: "HEAL_{PERCENT}"
---
Temporary HP is functionally identical to HEAL_{PERCENT} in any game where you're expected to keep fighting and using that HP. Reducing pain? HEAL_{PERCENT}. Burn injury? HEAL_{PERCENT}. Splint to keep you going? HEAL_{PERCENT}. It's all ways to keep the PC moving and fighting.
---
You could, of course, make injuries more challenging. You could make broken bones take FRACTURE_INTERVAL_{X} time to heal properly. But does the majority of your target audience want that sort of thing? Does enough of your overall audience want it bad enough to justify paying someone to create and integrate FRACTURE_INTERVAL_{X} into the game? How many people will be pissed and take to /r/fo76 with pitchforks if you release patch notes with something like "*Limb injuries now persist for five minutes"?
---
There are places suitable for such complexity, but this game is not designed around them or the ideals they represent, of " realism". This is not a realism game *by design*, it's a casual game. Stimpacks heal limb damage and HP because it's not really useful in game terms to have those be separate functions in a run and gun game with relatively simple combat against mostly AI opponents.
---
Eventually, when mod support happens, you *will* get what you want, because modders are driven by personal preference and there *is* an audience for what you're suggesting. But until then, Bethesda is not going to turn their casual firefight game into a realistic battle simulator.
---
I have donut, gt Plausible Whale 
---
I got the effigy like 3rd or 4th try. But took me forever to get an owl mask. Go figure.
---
Have you dropped it yet?
---
You didn't say "too rare," you said "bugged," meaning something not working as intended. There is a world of difference between the two terms.
---
We're in the control room now, waiting for a few minutes so more people can join.
---
If allowing smoking in a video game is what it takes to get rid of the young children from an M rated game, I‚Äôm all for it. 
---
It‚Äôs Bethesda, those two words are a defense and a liability to them. They also stated in a live stream that you could get different masks depending on how many robots lived.... in game it only affects % chance of getting a mask. 
---
Did you add the scorch mod you get after fire breathers to a three star?
---
Haha! I second that. I‚Äôd be all for it, honestly, if little kids weren‚Äôt exposed to it. 
---
You can actually put a bounty on someone‚Äôs head in survival mode so just get your buddy to put one on you.
---
üî™üíØ L O R DüíØüî™
---
Because they'd be all gross. How long has it been? Another commenter mentions FO4. That's even further away!
---
It‚Äôs worth the money with lots of friendly people that you can team up and would suggest finding some. You might encounter some not so nice people too, but that what happens in the wasteland. If you like Fallout you will like this game. There are somethings you will love and saomething you won‚Äôt, but overall it‚Äôs an awesome game.
---
Joining now just let me grab my mini nukes.
---
Server hoping still works. Sometimes you get the same one though. Most of the time you end up in a fresh one.
---
I literally added the scorched attachment for the sniper rifle, the same one used for the 10mm pistol when doing the into the fire quest. The sniper I think  I found it on a vendor, you'll be surprise what people throw away.
---
Nope, waiting for a few minutes so more can join.
---
yeah.
---
The one you posted? No. Most of those stashes were removed. Only the ones that correspond with the locations I listed, are still there. 
---
Part of the reason I did this was because I thought it was a case of sour grapes again, (effectively to push back) but after 160+ events, have to admit it seems a little challenging.     
---
Saltiness is a mixed bag, some of it is funny, but also worry it's leading to more rage quitting.  honestly worried about server populations, since mid week I keep seeing the same faces over and over (who I don't have on my friends list).
---
It doesn't matter because Bethesda patched this exploit out. They agreed it was an abuse of mechanics. But if you want to argue about it, let me pull out a soap box for you to stand on
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they are now properly implemented in the game. 
---
As some who was WoW rich for awhile, exactly! People like me would manipulate the markets to get rich, and stay rich. It will screw with every causal player, and next thing you know all the things cost far too much where the average casual player can not afford anything. 
---
Vending machines is going to mess with the economy a bit, but on a lighter scale. Plus with vending machines will allow gold goblins to goblin, while casual player isn‚Äôt hurt as bad. I think it‚Äôll be a nice balance. I‚Äôm ready to make caps, and be a farmer/vendor shop. 
---
If anything I want more shop type C.A.M.p items. Like the stalls from fallout 4, bar counters, maybe a safe trading box wall for survival. 
---
Plus there is nothing stopping anyone from making a C.A.M.P with an auction house, and forming their own. Then going to events and advertising their auction house. 
---
Another nice addictions would be player posters, or yard signs for advertising shops, and other player made businesses. 
---
little do you know, its the exact opposite of exhausting. nothing but relaxing 
---
I see your point in gas mask filters, carrying players, and radios. 
---
Nooiiiiice.
---
Ready when you are.
---
Still hoping for donuts!
---
I took the MIRV off and it kind of does what it is intended when I vats shoot a mini nuke. It's a lot of fun taking out little critters like squirrels.
---
The time table is the worst part. Look at how long it took people to farm tse guns back when that was a thing. I didnt get one til over 350 hours played. That's absolutely fine when theres no time limit. But to have this kinda drop rate with one week playablitly is insane.
---
From what I'm seeing Fallout 76 does not have human NPC interactions like in the solo games :(. Which is chill but I'll admit I did like the other solo games cause of the immersion and interaction with characters
---
Is there proof the other ‚Äúrare‚Äù masks are even available to players?  Maybe the bots just wear them?  I‚Äôve seen pics of players supposedly getting them but are they confirmed to be player accessible in some way and not just some PC trickery?  I don‚Äôt know just thinking aloud here and maybe I missed something.
---
Since were in this thread anyone have ps4 and wanna play? We could make a business and crap like that, cant play today but maybe sometime later
---
Can you tame a moth?
---
Maybe I'm just good about keeping a mental shopping list, but 3 minutes is a long freakin' time to browse the vendors.
---
Bethesda hasnt banned any trollers or anyone who does anything this sub considerers griefing. 
---
All of your reports are in vain. 
---
It isnt against the rules to be bad! 
---
I go to the event location and farm players by slapping them, initiating PvP with or without a bounty. My buddy likes to drop his power armor on the bridge, i havent done that one yet. Id like to drop my power armor then ask the group to pay me to remove it. Lol. Fits thematically with my raider character.
---
Something fun foe tomorrow maybe. I wonder whats a fair request to remove it? Stimpacks,, stealthboys, berry mentats? 
---
You playing a tesla rifle? It's known that this weapon can cause the bug and only relogging helps. 
---
It's called Jet.
---
It prevents the little critters from spawning and makes all the enemies you fight higher level.  You need to find critters outside the area and get the intestines back with enough time to complete the event and all the super mutant suiciders will be level 68 bullet sponges. 
---
Let me check the rules and regulations.
---
I ‚Äústole‚Äù someone‚Äôs drop last night on PC ,  I thought everyone could loot it once, didn‚Äôt know they changed the mechanism.  
---
Use the Sun Kissed perk card. Slowly cures rads during daytime
---
I killed him after the event, then some other folks cuz why not.
---
I've only found the Nuka cola paint jobs that are in the Domes at the Black mountain Ordnance disposal site. I've still got to get the BOS t-60 paint but that's rng from the Forbidden Knowledge repeatable quest. I'd love to get more in game paint. As I see it most of the paint for armor seems to only exist in the form of Atomic shop options.
---
Is no one going to point out the irony of someone with a "Raiders" flair complaining about someone stealing their stuff? 
---
no one?
---
In all honestly, Sorry that it happening to you.  That does suck.
---
That means you‚Äôve reached the max of stuff you can have in your camp.
---
You‚Äôll have to remove some other stuff 
---
&gt;owl (never seen one but they evidently exist)
---
The mystery thickens. I have devoted most of my playtime in the past month into finding the damn birds. The Prima guide has the only picture I have ever seen of one, and refers to them as Owlets. The wiki pages just cite the prima guide for all the stats of their meat and their cooked variant: "Owlet Nuggets." 
---
The game files include their sounds and textures and everything, but everyone I have talked to claims that they have never seen one. Its strange because the prima guide is more or less accurate on everything, and since it was apparently ingame at the time of writing, it doesn't make sense if it was cut.
---
So far I'm at 5 luck and 15 charisma, no further noticable changes. So we'll see I guess.
---
U drop yet?
---
Is that you c√∂usin?
---
I've never been able to hear anyone else in fo76.... various headsets, tried changing every possible setting--- I can SEE when they are speaking but the only thing I have ever been able to hear is game audio, not other people.  
---
Since November, on Xbox.
---
&gt; Another nice addictions would be player posters, or yard signs for advertising shops, and other player made businesses.
---
Ruined billboards would fit the advertising perfectly! 
---
I think it has to do with factions. So, you can only go to raiders or responders or boys so often (I forget the refresh rate). 
---
Nope getting ready to.
---
That mix it up challenge has proven to be a pain thus far. I will try to find the random encounter lemonade bot who sells lemonade, which counts. Otherwise it requires some fruit juice of 3 and tick blood tequila fermented twice to vintage, after being crafted with nuked crimson flux.
---
Someone found various spawn points in order to try to meet him. I'm gonna go hunting for him tonight.
---
I keep getting duplicated PA frames and now one even duplicated the excavator pieces that were on it. I took them off to put on T51 pieces and now they are stuck in my inventory and I cant get rid of them. Now I'm over my carry weight and cant drop these or salvage them 
---
It's been a bug for the past 2 patches. Resources won't respawn if you're near them. I don't know how far away you have to be or how long until they do respawn.
---
I gather all the wood around my camp and have to leave the area for awhile until the wood respawns. Server hoping won't fix it.
---
I just gave away 1k rounds to a random person at Fasnach. I think only lower levels use that ammo.
---
Hopefully this gets implemented down the road.
---
My money is on the storms blowing in from the Pitt. It's just a few miles north of Grafton. 
---
I'm curious what the actual charisma requirements are for taming with animal friend as the description states "as long as Charisma is high enough".
---
Started playing again yesterday after a month or so, had a great time... Today I keep DCing after max 2 minutes. On PC.
---
With ranks 3 fireproof and a dense torso mod it sounds trivial, might need to throw a tamed deathclaw or 2 in there to make it interesting ;)
---
How would know to light the end? You've been tucked away in a vault for X years. It's a foreign object. My bet would be you'd try eating them first. 
---
Didn't know about the slap damage that's cool. Though I do think BGS did put an incentive for you to fight people you're level or above. You get a significantly higher amount of caps when you kill players your level and above compared to killing lower levels. Which you only get a few caps for killing low levels. The problem lies with the players they're the ones who pick and choose who to fight and no one cares about caps late game.
---
I say make em "accidentally" break something in your camp or some other dudes camp. It makes them get a bounty which in turn made some level 100s who were in the area to murder em.
---
You're at Charlie? Someone else is doing alpha?
---
Oh, my, God! I never made that connection! Maybe I didn't manage to do it in the right order.
---
But yeah, totally agree.  Plus, with the condition of a lot of the bodies, it seems like we arrive just barely too late to save anyone.
---
Got three attacked me in the ammo plant for once, then during my last night‚Äôs SBQ fight, 4 showed up and after finishing them off, four more spawned from nearby fissure sites, I almost got blinded by their constant attacks.
---
This is only half true, tameable creatures need a specific flag which only creatures spawned in certain random events have
---
So no, you can't actually tame a scorchbeast or most creatures in that list
---
"Also, our clubhouse can kill us."
---
Thanks for your input. I had the crafting ores market cornered for about two months back in WoTLK. Havig played since Vanilla i had the purchasing power to literally buy out most competition and relist it all at my price.
---
Probably played nonstop during the beta and just farmed the hell out of whitesprings. I reached 100 in a couple weeks playing casually just farming whitesprings before they nerfed the xp and tse's.
---
Why is there a perk card that increases damage done to player structures? Seems like if it‚Äôs a feature of the game then it isn‚Äôt griefing. Now if they follow you to a new server and do it repeatedly then it‚Äôs griefing. Words matter.
---
Starting launch prep now.
---
They dont have any spawns in our worldspace unfortunately :( im hoping it comes with the scouts stuff
---
oooh good idea!! 
---
It is a lower chance but there is still a chance it will cure with radaway.
---
If you can get to whitesprings though, go there and go upstairs and buy a nuka grape from bubbles the vendor. (Go upstairs, find the bar and she is located near there). Nuka grape heals rads without curing mutations. 
---
Hopefully this will be enough to see you through until you rank up and are able to max your starched genes. 
---
Yep same here. I think they did say something about a PvP faction system but haven't mentioned it in months. I feel like they planned on doing stuff like that but ran out of time.
---
[$$$](https://youtu.be/GXE_n2q08Yw)
---
Vendors are in faction groups with shared cap amounts, only a few are individual.
---
No, no. I can place other stuff, hell, I can place a blank camp and I still can't place the fermenter. 
---
Heroin is called Med-X and Meth is called Jet. They all do have real world equivalents. Alcohol is the most dangerous drug we face today mainly because it has been normalized. This results in high fatalities both for overdose and also the poor decisions like drunk driving. People either don't look at the numbers or don't care. Some people think that alcohol is not a drug.

---
Mistress of Mistery quest Line have the best script ever done in a Bethesda game. Holy shit, I had to stop playing the game for some time after hearing the last holotape
---
I know you're probably joking, but it's kinda weird. Using drugs? Totally fine. Blasting a head off with a shotgun? No problemo.
---
But god forbid you would even think about smoking a cigarette.
---
Maybe someone can use the ammo
---
We need a bounty board. r/fo76bountyhunter.
---
I wonder if the current laws surrounding cigarette advertising in media has any impact on this. If they include a feature where you can smoke the cigerattes, would that mean they have to comply with different laws in each country 
---
I server hopped 54 times to get this event done....i wouldn't be upset if someone was trolling at this point
---
Quantum would have been the easiest thing to acquire, considering all the other stuff Lewis got his hands on to make Nukashine happen.
---
In the next update you'll be safe don't worry. No one will ever be able to bother you again. 
---
You can probably fix the cap farming issue and keeping the workshop in eternal contested status by just allowing an option for owners to relinquish ownership at any point they choose. The simple solution to not getting farmed is to not seek revenge so you're not immediately hostile, but you could allow another option where as soon the contestors start the claim it forces the owner into a dialog box option of defending or forfeiting the workshop. It's still sort of a handshake type system.
---
I don't think people are generally viewing the "defense by bounty" situation as an exploit. To many, it's something that kept them safe, but tbh it's situation of locks keep honest people honest. It's more likely to be abused by teams sweeping a map and covering every workbench in the area with stash boxes so the original owners or new players to the server have to incur bounty in order to claim/reclaim. Further, it gave more options to other play styles, like stealth builds, melee builds, etc to contest. That's pretty huge
---
This is kind of what I hate about the game
---
That‚Äôs a shite idea ngl.
---
Why would anyone voluntarily have griefing turned on for their camp.
---
Ok, I'll try there next
---
The people past level 50 more than likely have a wide variety of weapons, armor, power armor and mutations as well.
---
Lol true . And then you'd see players walking around holding another players pocket 
---
Just today I was getting so frustrated that "Bulked" items get broken down when you do "scrap all junk" WTF is the point of that, and WHY do you need to scrap bulk before you can use it to craft?
---
A variety of extremely annoying/stupid game design decisions were made with the recent update that introduce those changes.  
---
I can't even see any positive reason behind making those choices?!?
---
Teenagers are still kids and are just as impressionable. They're developing an identity during those years so if you give them a game where they can create a virtual character that they act through then adding a feature like being able to smoke cigarettes is probably at the bottom of the list of features a company wants to spend time creating. 
---
I‚Äôll add you when I get home from work. Probably won‚Äôt be til like 10 EST 
---
No, like I personally know this guy. We talked about it and he thought that dev room stuff is pc only, so if anything he's confused
---
There‚Äôs a video on YouTube of a maze in flatwoods, it‚Äôs pretty hilarious I highly recommend

Survivors don not smoke because smoking is bad and everyone who smoked died. 
---
I'm having fun with the event but the lack of rare mask drops just turn people away and make it harder to even get an event finished

Don't know haven't tried he is a friendly one that comes out after you complete a event at the lighthouse to give you the reward
---
Both flashbangs and nightvision are canon.
---
Flashbangs were in New Vegas: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Flash_bang
---
Night vision is also canon and seems more advanced than in our world. The Ranger Combat Helmet has built in night vision as well as the Hazmat Suit from the Old World Blues: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Hazmat_suit_(Old_World_Blues).
---
Because there are many types of scrap that vendors won't buy unless it's bulked, and, many vendors do not have the workstation near them needed to bulk those items.
---
It's EXTREMELY frustrating that "scrap all junk" un-bulks stuff, and, that you can no longer used bulked junk in crafting.
---
Right I have a smoking area on my patio, so I leave my guy there when I go out to smoke.

My experience on PC has been the same.  You joined in a golden era of stability.  Ever since Patch 7, it's gotten pretty bad again.
---
Screw you Helen. 
---
A player that uses that ammo with an automatic gun might need a lot. 
---
Wanna join me next time I do a nuke launch? You wait by the nuke zone after the launch. You park yourself on top of the shed by Prime, crack off a couple of shots at Queenie, then deal to the scorched while I punch, stab, shoot and generally piss the bitch off until she dies. That'd be awesome, hearing single shots and having scorched blowing up next to me ü§òü§ò

Wotlk was my expansion! I cornered the market on those spell power flasks, I had a low key great farm spot. It gave me mostly the herb I needed, but others too. So I undersold those other flasks/herb markets  to give me capital to buy out large shares of my flask market, when people tried to change it I had the gold to crash the market, and rebuild it back to my price point.  I also had a large stock built up across all my bank alts, and could crash the market extremely fast while still pull a profit. My operating cost were small, so I could afford to also buy the people undercutting me, and delisting even at a loss. I got a lot of hate mail, and messages, I would have to swap my alts around, and refill for free name changes basically. I also had to change servers, and real name changes on my mains. 
---
Between that, and all my time playing DayZ mod, and DayZ stand alone with light RP on PvP servers were the best gaming moments of my life. 
---
Fallout 76 has a lot of untapped potential that people have been ignoring for the bandwagon hate. I‚Äôm so excited for survival, vending machines, and to see what the C.A.M.P update brings. As a gold goblin how servers work is amazing! It‚Äôs not like those wow days, I‚Äôll have more people to market too, and if their is clutter find another server. The RP potential is also great. I‚Äôm going to be one of the people trying RP a medic in survival on console.

I've been thinking about it a lot lately, the unintended consequences of your new code in a living ecosystem. How in addressing one problem you might create another. Plus, some of my in-game friends that duped or were one step removed have, as of late, turned into these roving bands of assholes. They are the same guys. That's how they got all their fancy gear. This fella responding is probably one, too, or bought all his gear from them. It's just the exploi they're not being caught for yet. I was serious about reporting them. The report option says "cheating/exploit" for a reason. 
---
My buddies will admit it's the same need to find and cheese something, to look for the easy mode, which is funny because they all think they're so awesome. 
---
I can't wait for all those awesome dudes to go to the PVP server. I bet a bunch come back to adventure when they feel what it's like and are even worse.

2 different vendors and it resets every 24hrs from your last sell

I only ever keep essentials on me, no junk. All my junj is kept in my camp

There was in time in pre-Level 50 where a single Scorchbeast would terrify me and two were simply out of the question.

Nowadays, I see three, and I say bring it on.

I'm not sure I've ever had more than three on me.  It seems like you could get higher if you hang out around the Glassed Cavern.

In my country (Australia) all depictions of drug use in games must have a negative effect or games will be refused classification.

If you can get a cigarette addiction, or some other negative it would be allowed.

Well, i must have had the cap reset while trying to spawn it then, lol.

really I thought these were rare
---
Is that your final price?
---
No its not, i don‚Äôt know what to do

Really no difference in an 85 and a 500 if the 85 is geared and thought their build out beforehand. Mostly just gives them alot more flexibility bc of all the different cards they should have.

Would you like Todd Howard to come wipe your ass for you as well?
---
I've done this event so much hardly anybody turned up today,still not seen or got a rare mask drop.
---
I want one of those in real life, it seems like such a great future-retro camper trailer.
---
You're aware that the whole "stuck in the futuristic 50's" is a key component of Bethesda's fallout games, right? Arguably in all the fallout games (arguably because it's hard to have a thematic style when the game is almost entirely inexplicable deserts). Hell's Bells is awesome, but not thematically compliant, never mind Basket Case.
---
"LADY! Mom, call the dog!"
---
Ok. That's why i don't hear that biping as often .
---
There's some truth to that.  Chernobyl is pretty green, all told.
---
And it's not like the animals got away unscathed - many were horribly mutated.
---
You can make an offer or counter I‚Äôll listen
---
Nope
---
Yup! Here's a gallery of them all

Add me Jay_31_
---
Let me know roughly when's a good time for you, and I'll see if I can get on. We'll get on the same server and you can meet me at my place (I'm so over-encumbered right now), and do the trade. 
---
Okay 2500?
---
Very nice! (Is that him sniffing the trash in the kitchen? That's perfect.)
---
It's because tamed pets are hostile to other players. You can't become wanted killing a hostile animal. 
---
Do those scorched mods work on SB?  Im not sure if they count as scorched, animals, or both.
---
I wanted the masks to be super rare. I just wanted confirmation that they were even dropping so that it justified my 100+ times doing the event and that they weren't actually bugged. 
---
I haven't completed a single event because I get disconnected right before they end every time.
---
Add me on PS4 and I can hook you up with at least some gunpowder, maybe some of the rest. Not sure how my current stock is. 
---
zombiemann77
---
I‚Äôll sell for 948 caps
---
Yeah either way OP would be complaining. It‚Äôs either ‚Äúhelp people keep attacking me at my workshops‚Äù or ‚ÄúBethesda is giving preferential treatment to PvP players by giving them a separate game mode‚Äù. 
---
Who cares about +20% xp, people who PvP don‚Äôt want it and it‚Äôs obviously just something Bethesda threw in to try to get the PvE players to step outside their safe space once in a while.
---
&gt;Since Friday
---
Ps4, xbox, PC, or all of the above?
---
seems to be a lot more common since that nuke places guy made a video about it..
---
4 is my max at the same time. Makes it hard to see. Unfortunately in that fight none of them dropped any plans.
---
Okay  take it then 
---
You can literally pick up a crafting material profession, gain some entry level mats, and put them on the AH as a low level player and gain optimal amount of income allowing faster progression when that player has a larger amount of gold to spend on heirlooms, enchants, mounts etc. Because simply not everyone wants to run around looking for entry level ore or herbs, but new players can do it easily, and make some nice profit from doing so. 
---
Yup! They promote drinking but not smoking LOL
---
As a smoker ive always wanted my dude to be smoking while im outside smoking one
---
Yeah I‚Äôve wanted smokable cigarettes since fallout 3 and I‚Äôve been stuck with a few dogey Mods to do it for me. Please Bethesda Please
---
I installed a smoking mod in New Vegas. Was pretty cool. Could have it steady your aim like MGS, and do a cool animation. 
---
Pretty much this. I‚Äôve put a huge hold on nukes 
---
I finally found it at Sunnytop Station by chance after following Grahms routes for hours trying to find him.
---
Pripyat is precisely my evidence. They even introduce animals there. Going perfect :)
---
Lol well played my friend
---
i wish we could get a dev response on what the drop rates they expect for a "rare" drop to be.
---
I think there is an existing bug with the luck stat that might be influencing some drop rate issues. But we can't derive that unless we capture a large amount of data and know the expected drop chance.
---
Well we don‚Äôt have to pay for any future content with this game but basically you‚Äôre saying if we did then it would be DLC? Seems pretty arbitrary to me.
---
It won‚Äôt surprise me. 
---
I think that this sub is working itself up over purely anecdotal information. More people play the game than just this sub, and we have word from Bethesda (from their stream the day the event dropped) that the masks are dropping. Just because a couple hundred people on a subreddit think something doesn't necessarily mean that's the case. 
---
Like, "Bethesda needs to admit it's bugged." No, you don't know that it's bugged, you just think it is. 
---
Pretty bad luck! I saw it after 15minutes of gameplay. It was somwhere near rout 88B.
---
This would be awesome if you got cancer and your character perma deathbed after like 1 year of smoking in game. 
---
You don't have to seek revenge. You respawn, but they did not follow through with the contestation of the workshop. It reverts back to your ownership. They start contesting it again. Kill you again. Repeat. 
---
I'm not sure how this message corroborates that it was an unintended unsuspension. It essentially says, "as you were before, no change at this time" without expressing any intent. 
---
It‚Äôs coming‚Ä¶ it better. 
---
I did get you mixed up, but that last comment also applies to what you‚Äôre saying. It‚Äôs not a legal issue. 
---
No countries worth a significant market share are ‚Äúbanning‚Äù games with cigarette use, otherwise other AAA games would not include them.
---
It's kind of twisted, isn't it?
---
I got Marsupial under similar circumstances - a freak dose of radiation poisoning and no Starched Genes.  Was the most interesting two levels I ever had.  Suddenly, the lowly Feral Ghoul becomes the most terrifying thing on the map.
---
Stick to the Forest and areas where Ghouls don't tend to appear.  You can grind for XP at the lumber yard in the extreme northwest corner, that mining supply store south of Morgantown, and a few other areas.
---
Alternatively, you could use Power Armor or a Hazmat Suit.  Mutations survive death, and you will lose some Rads when you respawn, so it's not the worst thing in the world to die of radiation in this case.
---
Of course, I'm not here to fight 
---
That's the same progression that I made. Once you make it into the right side of the map, guns are way better. My current loadout is an AA hardened lever, an AA Grognak Axe, and a TSE combat shotty. I have a few Furious and Bloodied weapons that I've been trying out, but bloodied builds are really fragile.
---
Oh I mean the fact we were unsuspended briefly was ignored XD
---
Thanks for the tip! Only took a few server hops to find the Heavy Armor Arms plans I needed at Watoga.
---
im in the same boat..
---
I thought I had all the appropriate volumes up and settings right but apparently not..
---
I cant imagine what it could be
---
Yes I'm playing with an automatic Tesla rifle. I didn't know this was a "known" bug. I've been using it for the last two months as my primary weapon and it's the first time I've encountered this bug. I did end up switching servers. Although if this is a known bug why hasn't Bethesda fixed it... it's Game Braking... And annoying when you and your friends all have to all switch servers and lose all other workshops you have claimed. At this point it's costly and time-consuming. 
---
Lol right! I've encountered all of the other monsters many times and they have proven to be my favorite enemies, especially the mothman. 
---
I'll try running up and down 88, thank you for your input!
---
If your camp keeps getting destroyed it might be time to move.
---
&gt;I've been showing up to events with either two or three more people there.  
---
Yeah, I actually stopped bothering with it after three times,  It wasn't the masks, but the same plans from two of those three times. 
---
No. 
---
Just  no.
---
I honestly don't understand why anything in this quest should be rare at all.  Everything obtained will be  rare, to a degree, because anyone who starts the game after this event is no longer running  can't get them. People who didn't play the game during the week it was offered will never get them. 
---
This doesn't make the masks rare- it makes the unobtainable and nearly non-existent. 
---
My dude while I'm sure someone will willingly take your caps I strongly suggest you head to Watoga and walk around town, server hop, then walk around again if all you need is an arm. There is, to wit, at least 5 power armor frames with T-series armor in Watoga alone. One on top of the high school, one by the crashed vertibird downtown, one in a locked room at the transit center, one on top of the EMS building and another by a crashed vertibird on a roof on the north side of town. And as an added bonus many of these power armor locations will have T-series mods nearby that you can use, sell or trade.
---
To the Atom shop! 
---
We have a buyer
---
Strictly speaking, you don't necessarily know that when looking at a level 50 character--it could be someone's alt, which means it could have almost any of the same equipment as a higher-level character.
---
Level 50s will have only a limited number of perk cards, however, and only one level 50+ perk (if any).
---
Prestiging will also come into play in the summer, and who knows what that will bring to the table...
---
Really sucks because talking to people in game is one of the best things to do in fallout 76
---
Playing 76 has made me realize just how twisted Fallout 4‚Äôs BOS really is
---
That's why I always log out at vault 76.
---
Sounds good!
---
haha, yeah. i'm happy he actually made it inside the house. I've had issues forever with my pets not even making it anywhere near my house, they just sit hundreds of yards away from my camp so to see him actually make it inside was quite the nice surprise..... now here's hoping he stays. 
---
Yeah, you seem to get what I mean
---
 Thanks for the tip! Only took a few server hops to find the Heavy Armor Arms plans I needed at Watoga. 
---
I dont think so. 
---
I know I‚Äôve been doing that drop site V9 and three places in the ash heap and I can‚Äôt find it for the life of me.  Thanks though man
---
Any armor 
---
Have you tried doing Queen of the Hunt? It's a bugged daily quest but if you havent triggered it yet then head over to Hunter's Shack in The Mire. The quest is all about hunting cryptids, one of them being the FM. 
---
Sounds like a workshop waiting to be added
---
I‚Äôm absolutely terrible at picking up environmental storytelling details. When I see a crib with a toy car in it, the only thing on my mind is ‚ÄúI need that nuclear material‚Äù. I wish I could experience things like this.
---
I have had the same experience. 200 hours of gameplay and not a single glimpse of the flatwoods monster.
---
Gotta find the plans.  Don‚Äôt believe ‚Äúdeep pocketed‚Äù is a mod that can be learned by scrapping. 
---
But, you don‚Äôt need to scrap items with the mods to learn mods that can be learned thru scrapping.  Any item works. 
---
With everything that I have said, let me say that I have been enjoying the event.  I just wish the drops were slightly more prevalent.  Even if I didn't get one but saw someone else get one.
---
I posted something similar a few weeks back. I find that my session/s become increasingly unstable when I take a workshop or two. I only really take workshops now for ease of travel, but even then I can't go more than a few hours without being disconnected. Whereas I rarely disconnected when I don't take workshops... can't be a coincidence surely? 
---
Try the queen of the hunt daily event, it‚Äôs triggered in a little shack somewhere near Abby‚Äôs Bunker. That‚Äôs how I found it - it was a marker for the event. I‚Äôve done queen of the hunt several times and it‚Äôs not always a marker, but it‚Äôs a good start. 
---
Uninstall the crap game that it is and get a refund
---
If u can wait a. Pulls hours I'll help you I need to do it myself and have been working towards it but still need to go to though the defiance and DMV portions.  If you want to run through it when I do send me your GT and I'll invite u when I get to that part
---
May I ask how? What places did you farm?
---
There are seven factions: Watoga, BOS (in Watoga), Free States (Harper's Ferry), Whitesprings, Enclave, Raiders, and Responders. Their caps pool resets every 20 hours. Sometimes, if it is near the 20 hour mark it will say 0,but if you try to sell something it will properly reset to 200.
---
nop not "human" npc ...but we got "robot" npc\`s ..sooo yeah not like in solo game. And if you like solo, in 2 days we will have survival mode, so u wont see anyone at map, and if u somehow find other human u will die.. xD
---
What is it exactly that makes it crap?
---
(Its about resources)[https://youtu.be/GXE_n2q08Yw]
---
Not "enjoyment". Low levels may still be carrying all the junk they picked up. 40+ lbs of junk isnt uncommon when i kill a lowbie who owns a workshop
---
Do you have multiples of other crafting stations? 
---
They're still tied to the buildable area or they lose the claim. It's purposely set up so you have the advantage to flee, but IMO you should be given the option to relinquish control every time the workshop changes to contested status. You don't need to flee if you can give it up at any time
---
They can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs not possible.
---
The level of ignorance with some players is unbelievable.
---
I mean, it's a limited time event.  Anyone who doesn't play during the week it was going on won't get the mask. Doesn't that make anything obtained in it rare?  And does it need to be any more rare than that?
---
Oh hell you‚Äôre right about the NPC animation in fo4, I was just thinking about the character. To be fair though that‚Äôs just one animation and only happens while the box is standing still. Not an exact transfer to bring that to the player character who could be told to smoke a cigarette while standing walking running in combat etc. That‚Äôs why there aren‚Äôt player character animations for all the other chems as well. 
---
I've encountered it twice in wooded areas NW of Watoga, and once on the road between R&amp;G ststion and Watoga
---
Vendors restock their 200 caps 20 hours after you first sell something to them.  
---
There are 7 different vendor factions.  All vendors of the same faction share a common cap pool.  Watoga just happens to have two factions side by side.  
---
Yeah I don't think so. I can play for hours if not in team and not taking workshops. Otherwise its disconnects all day
---
I‚Äôve had some Nuka Grape now but definitely has been weird. I‚Äôve had random who I‚Äôm teaming with people drop me Radaway
---
I will sell you one
---
That would make too much sense.
---
No, any piece of armor will allow you to learn mods for it.  *However*, certain mods are arbitrarily locked off from this method.  Yes, it's stupid.  Dense is definitely one.  I *think* Deep Pocketed may be as well.
---
Oh c‚Äômon, she‚Äôs just worried about second-hand smokeüôÉ
---
50/50, I lost a mutation with rank 1 starched genes with the first radaway I took. 
---
Raiders, responders, bos, whitesprings, watoga, harpers ferry.  I may be missing one.
---
 Each of those factions has a 200 cap 20 hour reset from your last purchase.
---
I'm a rifle build.. Have 3* ghoul slayer lever (whitespring) also a zealots and a mutant slayer..I'm close to basically one shorting most..if u are doing bloodied..make sure u just focus on all the bloodied perks..its fragile..but that's the point of it..I haven't done it yet but I'm considering creating a new character for bloodied only..that's all my friends talk about lol
---
Is it stored?   Is it your camp, not a friends or a workshop?  
---
Awesome what‚Äôs your psn 
---
 I walk often from my place in the Mire, not far from Dyer Chemical, to The Whitespring. 
---
 I have killed the sucker maybe 3 times in the last 3 weeks, he shows up quite a bit in that part of the world.
---
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tt26P2e72O_9AGNHjCt0RzuTjhZUxxfv

I‚Äôll help you; if you run my level 11 thru ‚ÄúMayor For a Day‚Äù after
---
The game is randomly resetting the chat volume to zero. Go to menu &gt; settings &gt; audio &gt; chat and move the slider to max or reset all to defaults. It works for me. You may have to repeat from time to time. 
---
It is my camp. 
---
There is a difference between anger and frustration my dude. I'm glad the masks arent easy to get, but I am frustrated that the limited time of this event has gotten a lot of players feeling like the time they're putting in is not worth much. Am I gonna boycott this game because I didnt get one? No. Am I gonna keep doing this event? Hell yes. Because guess what? Every item in this game is digital and I fucking want it, welcome to online games where it's all digital items that people want. 
---
I'll do that I hope it works 
---
This is the vendor loop cheat sheet I sort of made, based on a past post here. Note that some of the areas, the vendors aren't available until you progress enough in the story. 
---
Harper's Ferry &gt;&gt;&gt; Watoga Station  &gt;&gt;&gt; Watoga Shopping Plaza &gt;&gt;&gt; Whitesprings Train Station &gt;&gt;&gt; Bunker &gt;&gt;&gt; Flatwoods &gt;&gt;&gt; Sutton Station.
---
aight will add you now thanks my id is sofiantobias01
---
deep pocketed, shadowed, ultra light can only be unlocked by plans
---
Thanks for the successful kill everyone!
---
Maybe try teaming with someone who can share rank 2.
---
Love his video on how to build a trap base that launches you off a cliff!
---
&gt;your last purchase.
---
Prettt sure it‚Äôs first, not last.  I have done days where I spend my whole night buying/selling from the same vendor to get CAMP plans and still get the 200 reset at the beginning of my next day playtime, not 20 hours after my last transaction.  
---
Great post. Awareness is key. Understanding of the overly complicated PvP system is critical to having a good time and avoiding raiders. 
---
Its your duty to server hop if you dont PvP!!! YOU ARE OPTING OUT! Please use the tools Bethesda gave you to opt out!
---
You cant report people for doing this. As of right now, its part of the game! Be aware of raiders, take precautions!
---
- Raider who does this kind of thing
---
That is incorrect. There is nothing in the data that says anything about a specific flag other than the one that references the creatures race
---
If you have mods for the older fallouts like 4 an 3 they have a mod that allows you to or just adds it to the character. Not entirely sure, but I do know for a fact its in those. Seen too many vids with people having their main characters with a cig in mouth
---
ObesePigeon1
---
You say that like Bethesda's word is solid gold; while the way they've handled this game so far seems to show otherwise. They can't even seem to fix the bulk scrap glitch they introduced several patches ago, what makes you think they executed this event flawlessly on their first go?
---
People that use the LMG use that ammo. It has become a whole lot more viable since last patch. It wrecks now. 
---
If you dont get them and are on PC I gotchu covered 
---
Am I the only person who finds it odd that it survived the crash and maintained as much of its infrastructure as it did? I'm not an aerospace engineer, but I'd imagine the velocity at which it would at a much higher velocity than commercial aircraft (which, while not vaporized, are much more destroyed than what we see with the station). In order to maintain a position above the planet and also stay in orbit, it would have likely been traveling through space at a much, much, faster velocity than any airliner. Even accounting for drag as it plummets through the atmosphere, I can't see how it would do anything other than vaporize itself and a ton of earth when it smacks into the ground.
---
Gave one away yesterday at a fasnat event.
---
It seems like they're just being diplomatic. They didn't even accuse you of using exploits, instead saying the character is in a unique situation.
---
Dog food! 
---
Same. At this point, I'm just telling myself this is for plans and recipes for alts, or to sell. Ridiculous that we can't get half of the reward masks.
---
Haha. So you can NUKE IT FROM ORBIT?!?
---
Huh??
---
No thanks, bub.
---
I was expecting a screenshot of a rare mask yet got epicness instead
---
I love you!

LMFAO üòÇ.....the bad ole days
---
 What ya do is set yer sights on the place it's head will be. It takes a while but I can get moving headshots quite often.
---
 Now I have never used VATS so I have no idea how that works. ;)
---
Is this person named RB something. Whomever it is report them to Bethesda. That is an exploit. 
---
PS4. Just south of grafton dam north of Morgantown. About halfway between the two literally in the river.
---
Does Nuka Grape remove mutations?   It‚Äôs -400 rads.  
---
Maybe they are playing at weird times. I've never had less than 5 people doing it. 
---
I'm not down with the other folks, but definitely kill him. 
---
The owner gets an easier time killing the enemies, as long as he stands there and tags them with a shot from some gun, he gets XP and loot.  It means you can be super lazy.  You just wait for people to come to the Golf Club to initiate a respawn then leech off it.  It denies other players their fair share, and basically is a pretty selfish and lazy way to play that deserves no respect :)
---
WestTek, about 30-40 in one spot and instant respawn when server hop, should be around 22-30 , 
---
It didn‚Äôt for me but I had rank one starched genes  so maybe I got lucky
---
 Sadly my RP does not allow that. I'm always handicapped in Fallout, but I would not have it any other way.
---
How much for a sausage?
---
Find me on Xbox. I‚Äôm right between Uncanny Caverns and Pleasant Hills Cemetery, right on the side of the road in the forest.
---
Same, probably has to do with event where everyone server hops to try and get an extra run per hour since it ends on 26th.
---
Ive only seen it in the savage divide. Maybe 4 times now. Never in actual flatwoods! 
---
I'm 800 hrs in. 
---
I keep zero duplicates of masks or plans. It makes me happy at the end of the event to see all the people dropping dupes and others walking around to grab what they don't have.
---
Well then that still constitutes as rare doesn‚Äôt it? 
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
They had a mod in FO4 where you could smoke. I'm still waiting to run across a meth lab here.
---
I've given up. Now I'm just doing it for the decorations. I got 4 characters to get them for. I think I have a complete set for my main (encumbered I have to claim the junk yard to see what ive got) and I think I have enough for my others. 
---
Go to the settings &gt; audio &gt; chat and check the volume slider. It's been randomly resetting to zero. You might need to fix it every once in awhile. 
---
I definitely agree and you should see my post and others about the rare Fasnacht Masks that was a chore and all of that grinding was for nothing because it felt rigged in the first place. Bethesda I they are doing their best I couldn't imaging what things look like behind the curtain. The mechanics of this game must be insane I couldn't even image what it would be like to manage everything. I have been playing for a while and just like the other Fallouts still find new things to do.
---
Only seen it twice in 320 hours, once when I was being attacked by 2 scorchbeasts at  Berkley springs workshop .. that didn‚Äôt go well. then yesterday when I fast travelled back to my camp...
---
Things  get weird when he‚Äôs around! 
---
Thank you! +karma 
---
The game has 1 million problems 
---
If they're on a team, one player can stay there, their teammate can gank you anywhere on the map. 
---
I can only imagine having an attitude like this gets you far in life. 
---
Are there any entertainment/video game, FCC, EU or other Governmental/International law/regulations specifically against simulated smoking that are on the books on this point?  Tobacco right now is in the same position as alcohol was in the early 20th century where it is uniquely viewed and regulated as opposed to other edible vices.  
---
But it is an absolutely valid logical point. With the other junk allowed why isn‚Äôt it allowed with either permanent or short-term character nerfs.  From a programming point I suppose it would take much more effort in terms of poses,etc.  And, as all cosmetic things in these games nowadays it would probably be popular and have plenty of different versions to gather. 
---
Annnnddd...with THESE teams our characters would probably end up smoking out their ears...
---
I'm on PS4.. I had the chance to visit the event today twice and picked up 2 new masks! Like I said I hope Beth has more events like this. It's cool to see everyone and some of the power armor that show up are bad ass! I saw a Quantam painted one today. üò®
---
Join the event and go for a beret, some folks drop there duplicate masks, berets sometimes..
---
Same
---
Hello. Yesterday I experienced same issue on this quest. Restarted the game many times, but still crashed.
---
Fast travel to anywhere then back and its work! 
---
What kind of ammo you need?
---
I thought when I typed AFTER THE BATTLE, people would infer that this specific instance of behavior is unnecessary.  Changing servers is a way to avoid harassment.  It is not a ‚Äúfeature‚Äù of the game.  I thought blocked players couldn‚Äôt follow you to a new server?  I agree that the majority of griefing complaints I have seen on this sub are usually frustration from not knowing ‚Äúeverything‚Äù about pvp, but where is the line?  Also, what perk card are you talking about?
---
Probably got dial up and live in Kansas
---
Huh, you just enlightened me on a really great incentive for making a new character. Too bad we'll still get wrecked in survival mode with everyone's decked and duped out builds carrying over.
---
If you liked fallout 4, then you would find a lot to like in 76.  I loved 3 and NV, but didn‚Äôt like 4 at all.  Nothing wrong with it on a technical level, it just wasn‚Äôt for me.  I see you would be playing it on pc.  I also play on pc and have been since day 1.  Through my personal experience, 76 has ran horribly.  I love the game as a West Virginian, but again my personal experience has been a disaster.
---
Many broken quests that can‚Äôt be completed, broken launcher where the game won‚Äôt even function that day, game crashes every 3th or 4th session, awful frame rate chugging even after setting everything to a medium setting, lag is pretty bad imo, enemies still don‚Äôt function properly about 50% of the time....
---
I love 76.  I still play because I love the experience, and defend it against haters who will never touch it.  But this is my experience with the game, and honestly improvements for me has been very minor since day 1 
---
Xbox, in the ravine north of Helvetia üëç
---
I want one as a camp item. 
---
Time to root thru your post history, grab your ign and kill the dog!!!!!!!!
---
Nah just kidding, dats bad.  Hi doggy.
---
I would honestly watch out for reddit snipers. They exist. Not me though, i dont break the rules.
---
I give away ammo to lower level players all the time. 
---
308 is super useful at those lower levels.
---
Emart51 let me know man 
---
I start 5:30 pm get off 6 am

There's always not being a dick in the first place.  Maybe you should try that and see how people react.
---
Lvl 60 
---
Iirc, a patch note said it got rid of that a while back? I can't recall the exact one.
---
It‚Äôs a trap!
---
You get new perks after level 50. 
---
You can pick a new perk or move a special point every level. Every 5 levels you get a perk pack.
---
This guy Dunes
---
I'll work 3days on 2 days off 2 days on 3 days off
---
haha, fingers crossed that pacifist camp update comes soon. but honestly if he does happen to get killed it wouldn't be that big of a deal. knowing they're in the game now means I could eventually find another. :)
---
You see that bastard, I want him DED! 
---
Thanks bro
---
I usually see 50-100 caps per piece depending on which one 
---
It was, in fact, a Jimmy Neutron episode! I think it was called "Creation of a Salesman".
---
I think the reason you couldn't vats him because you were both participating in the event.  It seems to prevent vats from tracking other players while its running.  Which is usually a good thing.  
---
I'm not sure how he killed you the second time.  Obviously you were still in pvp but I thought that ended on death.  Did you have a workshop at the time?
---
TBH most of those people with the highly duped gear don't know how to use it or it's limitations. Understanding the mechanics and knowing how to use them to your advantage beats out equipment pretty often. Let's not delude ourselves into believing duping has been fixed. There's still dupe exploits. They're just not putting them on youtube anymore because they don't want them patched.
---
See, I want this too.
---
But it would have to be something appropriate like the twist or the mash potato or something. And it'd have to have very good animation, otherwise it'll just be cringy.
---
i had inventory mod installed, but uninstalled it once nukashine came around as it made you unable to see the nukashine in your inventory. possible that some gunk still remains. the crashes always seem to happen grouped together (can go 6 hours without a crash and then 3 happen), so it might just be the servers being unstable at the time
---
Oh the problem you're encountering is problem. There is no solution to problem, and problem is recurring for all players. Problem is core mechanic.
---
I'm genuinely sorry you experienced this kind of crap. PvP is not fair or able to be understood in this game. It would be way better if you chose team on the menu, as a raider, or survivor. Survivor having PvP protections, and Raiders having PvP against other raiders plus more.
---
I have seen violet go up to 200 per piece, that‚Äôs the only exception 
---
Yes, you are correct. Sorry about that.
---
Emart51 we can do it 
---
Usually 50-100c each. The yellowcake and fluorescent tend to be cheaper (50ish) while the other three tend to go for between 75c on the low end and about 100c. I would not pay more than that, as they are frequently available at those prices (some people will sell all flux for 50c or 100c regardless of color; just a matter of watching/waiting).
---
Yes, but OP is suggesting they allow players to just set a high bounty on themselves 
---
&gt;you could allow another option where as soon the contestors start the claim it forces the owner into a dialog box option of defending or forfeiting the workshop. It's still sort of a handshake type system.
---
&gt; but IMO you should be given the option to relinquish control every time the workshop changes to contested status. You don't need to flee if you can give it up at any time
---
It's like you're purposely ignoring the solution I keep suggesting. This change negates that issue
---
I get it but again I've only seen one drop altogether 
---
Ah ok
---
Vendor it or wait for a buff for berseker effect
---
One star? I'd discard it.
---
Alright thanks thats what I figured. Berserker is pretty terrible.
---
Attitude?   Its a statement.    Not sure how one statement reflects my life, but I have done well for myself.  Hope the same for you.
---
I saw it once in the shooting range near Grafton.
---
Nope just showed up to the event and decided to snag a bounty since I was there, like I said pvp isn‚Äôt really my thing, but the vats n 2nd death thing wasn‚Äôt something I knew could happen 
---
Will the legendary vendor take 1 star weapons?
---
Well pacify and tame are two substancially different things in the game. You seem to be perfectly describing " pacify" and its mechanics.
---
Taming follows different rules. Maybe you just need to look elsewhere in the code.
---
When it does come out, I figured it would.
---
i was gonna point it out myself but /shrug lol
---
Tricentenial paint, came with a special edition of the game but you can buy it on the PS store 
---
I'm online for a bit if you want to hop over or I can hop to your server.  What ever works for you.
---
For weapons I drop everything but  1-3* Bloodied or Furious and 2-3* Instigating, Two Shot or Anti Armor
---
Honestly I have no idea when it comes out.
---
i have a picture from a guy wearing the harlequin. but i can't upload it here. or am i missing something
---
Well I‚Äôm actually looking forward to the survival servers...at least then I know exactly what I‚Äôm signing up for üòâ
---
I had the same problem before I realized there was a volume slider. I have to turn it all the way up just to barely hear people.
---
I wish more people liked doing group photos. I tried to get a couple good photos on the first day of fasnacht day but I could never get everyone to. 
---
How about 100?
---
Thank you!
---
Also 10mm, Laser Rifle and Hatchet have skins if you have the tricentennial pack
---
There are ofcourse some exceptions :)
---
I think if you are given the daily quest and then don't finish it before you log off or get disconnected you can't get it again. That has been my experience with the Huntmaster and Camden so far.
---
It's not crap, jus play and have fun for real!! Lotta friendly players out there so jus enjoy it, 
---
TIPS
---
- power armor sucks in pvp  
---
- idk much else sorry
---
Don't think it'll do that much damage that it will melt the queen like nothing, but thanks for the invite.
---
There's another issue. I've repeatedly checked/reset my settings and still can't hear anyone.
---
Came here to see if I wasn‚Äôt the only one
---
Awesome pic!
---
When you are in the area, don't forget to visit the newly rebuilt Tyler County Train-station for all your trading needs.   
---

---
I always drop plans/masks I already own and use "follow me" emote to bring people to the paperbag. I don't like the idea of hoarding them and then later sell 'em after 6 months or something.
---
He who controls the duping controls the game. 
---
At least they are making everyone able to kill and all weapons being effective for it. It's actually fair.
---
That change would be great. I read over it since Bethesda set up the workshops as PVP zones. I don't think they're going to let us opt out of the core mechanic. Sorry I didn't state that earlier. 
---
Blight is in the ash heap, golden and growing on tree stumps, it may be the more south you go the more popular. 
---
I get glowing resin around whitesprings, it has a couple near the train station fast travel, I usually remember them because they are the blue glowing ones when it‚Äôs nuked. 
---
How OCD are you? If everything has to be perfect and flaw free, then probably not just yet. If however you don't mind some issues, some that admittedly are game breaking in some instances, and enjoy the neverending quest for better stuff, and a flashier looking campsite, then you might enjoy it. Playstyle as a solo will work for the main storyline, but when you start considering the endgame sections with the Scorch Beast Queen and nuke zones you'll appreciate some company.
---
Well, I'm certainly more inclined to believe the people who have access to the actual data over a few hundred people sharing anecdotes on a subreddit. 
---
Yes I‚Äôll do it I‚Äôll dm you my gamer tag just inv me and I‚Äôll fast travel to you and buy it. 
---
Are you on?
---
I've probably encountered this legendary creature (alien) 6-7 times.  Killed it once.  
---
I think key to coming across many of these non-central creatures is to actually traverse the land on foot.  In other words, the more one fast travels the less chance of encounters.  
---
Add a temporarily reduced AP regen and you're golden!
---
someone disliked ur comment, im assuming it was amburka. So i gave u a like back for defending me man.
---
Yes.they now die for good,no matter what kills them.
---
how bout instead of disliking valuable replies, you respond back with evidence and reason to defend your shitty claim?
---
Sounds more like anger to me. 
---
In pvp vats crits are only chance against sentinel builds. In pve i go with hard aiming
---
This just happened to me on pc
---
Title
---
Goto flatwoods or overseers camp and store them in the Overseers box.    New players are almost always going to check those first.
---
The game is designed to let me decide if i am everyones enemy or teammate. 
---
I dont *have* to be a goody two shoes. I am a bad boy raider. Bad to da bone. Now gimme 100 rubber and ill BOUNCE. Gimme 50 adhesive and i wont STICK around. Gimme 30 gears and I'll TURN out. 
---
Get it? Imma bad boi
---
No
---
Yeah but im offeri g a compromise, make them pay that bounty up front, then it is harder to exploit
---
The skull is the only one that looks decent anyway lol , it should have been 9 of the masks have the same droprate and maybe winter mask is insanely rare
---
I need someone there dealing to the bloody scorched mobs. Nothing more annoying than lining a shot up and just as you shoot some scorched commander smacks you with a shovel and buggers your shot. 
---
We need a lot more emotes üòÇ
---
That's crazy, and I play pacifist. 
---
I don't know, there's still some legacy stuff from how it used to happen that could make it's way back in. When it was a circle around the bench if you had a third party come in (neither contesting or original owner) and they stepped inside the bench circle they were essentially counter-claiming both parties and were now hostile. They could have the same detection system so players are only hostile within the buildable area. There's a 100 solutions to this. Given how often players just take workshops just to have a fast travel point or just to complete a challenge, there's really no good reason not to have a forfeit feature. 
---
At 19k each I understand as well, I know 0 serum recipes atm.
---
I had someone who I suspect nuked it (only based on his actions during the subsequent parade)... he personally bugged/derailed two of the robots and the other 3 were massacred by a wave of level 40 glowing wolves at the end.
---
Thanks Frodo Douchebaggins.
---
If that's Seneca Rocks, it might be my camp
---
I learned brotherhood of steel mod from scrapping low level combat armor. Everyone said this one won‚Äôt learn from scrapping but I got it. Deep pocketed can also be learned by scrapping armor
---
Real evidence in this case would be a screenshot of the rare masks in the reward popup. That hasn't come up yet
---
Been saying this for a while. I have a full set and I'm amazed at how much ass I kick specifically because of unyielding armor. It's gonna get nerfed and most people will be shocked and outraged when it does..
---
Maybe they left them in due to the early games. Nostalgia?
---
I don‚Äôt trade when standing next to a stash box. 
---
The temporary unban was a server test. Because so much server instability was caused by the fausnaut event, they opted to reinstate until next patch where they will have a better fix for the issue. 
---
Also I am sick of how pointlessly mean spirited people are in this reddit about the issue.  If this was a competitive game with tournaments, active leaderboards, etc.. I would be right behind you. It's not so I don't really care what other people do as long it doesn't hinder me.  Y
---
Can‚Äôt you stack power armor on top of each other and climb on top? I know you can stand on power armor, I just don‚Äôt know if it stacks....
---
I agree with this. I‚Äôd also add that I don‚Äôt care what anyone says violet flux is terrible to farm lol nuking prime fissure and dealing with the queen then every other player scrambling to get the flora and getting all the other components like mass and fluids from whitespring, add in the weight to your stash and managing. If you can get violet for 75-100 each jump on it. It‚Äôs worth more lol 
---
Witch hunting. Reported.

and a cool PA helmet mod that allows you to smoke without negative effects

No bonuses are benefited. Just the amount of hunger replenished is doubled.

How much you looking to spend?

Don't know.
---
Sorry, have to ask, you have old man winter?

Just be wary there are players out there who slap you and then try to trick you into damaging them back so they can get caps from you

If your on xbox one and have this shoot me a price as well üòÇ

Its a funny world, Socially acceptable to be a Socially functioning Alcoholic , it's Socially acceptable to binge drink on a weekend start a few fights and piss in the street, if don't join in with the drinkers they often say "your being boring, lighten up drink some liver rot " .
---
It's also socially acceptable to advertise Alcohol and Gambling infront of Kids during prime sporting events and football shirts with Alcohol/Gambling sponsership worn by kids... 
---
Yet if you smoke or do drugs but act responsibly and don't hurt or steal from anyone you're still stigmatized by a media led society as a bad guy far worse than any Alcoholic.
---
I don't agree with advertising cigarettes of any form but i also think too much Desensitization without education is also a bad thing!!. The Media are Hypocrites here as they happily advertise Alcohol wich is a far worse drug than nicotine imo.
---
However I think IF Smoking were in Fallout it should have no buffs and a you smoke to keep down a nasty semi permanent debuff untill you cold turkey - cold turkey should be dependent on the length of time you were a smoker.. Make it a horrible thing to have.
---
Negatives of Alcohol and Drug addiction should be worse too, like shit stained pants and random vomiting with the inability to eat food for short periods.
---
Its fucked up how equally bad Drink, Smoking , Drugs , Gambling are yet people largly because of the Media choose to view Drink and Gambling as ok, when they're not ok.
---
Ether have it all responsibly implemented or have nothing.
---
My camp is in the savage divide and it's attacked my camp three times now. One time is was real buggy... Like you know the glitch wolves you sometimes see? It was one of those things, but a few possessed wolves where there too. It killed me because the glitch makes it immortal, but as soon as I died it morphed into the Flatwoods monster.
---
Yeah, and a dense armor mod made TSE's into pillow fights. Still nerfed em.
---
I love this!
---
Imo don't do quests till your 50 stick to random events. Farm whitesprings west tech and Harper ferry

---
Raiders don't use exploits that require fundemental knowledge of how the game functions to actually work. A Raider would have no way of knowing that the pathfinding is so bad. A Raider wouldn't be able to magically spawn power armour. A Raider wouldn't see any profit in this action because a raider wouldn't know that this event had rewards. If a raider DID know the event had rewards, he'd do it himself.
---
You aren't role playing a Raider. You aren't. You can try to justify yourself, but everyone will agree that your 'rp' is really utilizing an exploit to grief players.
---
This isn't petty, fake griefing. This is the real deal, you're doing it not for any financial gain, but purely because you get joy out of the misery of others. Even if it's a videogame, such behavior is not only despicable, it's also concerning.
---
Sounds like a personal problem.
---
I‚Äôll let you know
---
How that guy is not banned is beyond me scamming everybody.
---
I agree there are 100 solutions to this. The problem with those solutions is seeing all the problems they create in the living ecosystem. Bethesda does not seem to be very good at thinking like the those who would seek to exploit their systems. They need some raiders on their teams. 
---
Well, if you can do that in mid to close range combat while surrounded by 10 mobs then you're amazing. With vats it takes 10 shots, which would be under 10 seconds for 10 mobs.
---
Vats with gun-fu is one of the fastest ways to wipe out large group of mobs. Even faster than some melee builds since my rifle can shoot faster than a sledgehammer can swing. 
---
I often find unlocked supply drops (Plus a few locked) that aren't mine and have never been made wanted for collecting them.
---
Other people have however complained about being made wanted for looting unlocked drops so I've always found it weird. 
---
Yes, judging by the resounding agreement responses... it must just be me.  
---
Probably related to real world effect of wine
---
Deezer‚Äôs lemonade is made with 100% pure lemonade!
---
Because I didn't use exploits and they know it. Their wording is very specific. I will upload a video from the brief time I was unsuspended and show my inventory ;-) I wasn't even at 400 pounds in weight.
---
In the same way that unicorns and Sasquatch are rare. 
---
Just yesterday I sold Violet for 35 caps each and the others for 30 caps each. You can find deals on the trading forums - I don't have any left to sell at the moment, otherwise I'd offer to you for the same price. 
---
Whats so impressive about the radios? They were in at the start of the game and got removed
---
All the display items from fo4 should be implemented. 
---
Lol i know
---
Appalachia. Good luck.
---
Bethesda did an excellent job continuing the fallout storytelling in 76.  There are still some interactions with some NPCs that are enjoyable.  I recommend you get it.  If you like fallout, you will like 76.  If you really like NPCs befriend some of the die hard role players or be one yourself!

Can anyone else confirm this?

Don‚Äôt knock it til you try it. Remember that Cass‚Äôs whiskey from New Vegas includes battery acid.

You be walking down the Railroad and Sticking some Med-x in your damn arm. Than go I wish I knew to open a Damn Pack of Cigarettes.

It says your offline do I just inv you to the game?

I've enjoyed the game alot but tbh I think I'll enjoy it more on survival so I'm ready

You pick up toy cars but can't sit on a random road and play cars. ;)

That would be a great photo op.

I can only do this when requesting and they set a price, than I can decline.  But if I‚Äôm selling, I cannot decline a ‚Äúrequest‚Äù.  I‚Äôm on Xbox.

If you stop all the robots from crossing the second bridge, but let the master of ceremonies through, you can keep them from being damaged and they'll have a shorter walk back to the start.  The event continues as normal as long as the MC can pass through.

I don't know if this guy was trying that though.

You dont find it, it finds you.

What's your GT? I'll try to add you

Coming Soon, This Summer, Vault Dwellers finally how to smoke a Cigarette and Learn how to fight Lung Cancer at the same time.

Lucky for you lol, past few days on my servers have been hectic. Seeing 4 players slap people under lv15 with a rain of tse is the norm for me I guess. I need to find the ones you are on :)
---
Like how you can't show a character smoking in a game where you can play as the literal devil in the case of Heroes of The Storm.
---
It's kinda weird what is and isn't allowed.
---
It came with two codes. Base game and then the Tricentennial add-on. Neither worked so I'm returning it to Amazon.
---
tbh they just need more people that actually play the game on staff. There are way too many obvious issues with the game before you even get into deeper mechanics that raise issues. Contesting within the build zone was a step in the right direction IMO. They just failed to fix the issue of flagging people hostile regardless of location, the re-flagging system by entering/re-entering the claim zone, etc.
---
The problem I see is the community seems to be arguing against workshops being contestable and that's def the wrong way to go about it. Assuming that people will come together and be cooperative in all cases is just naive. Fasnacht is a coop event and people are trolling the event by blocking robots, leaving the event to initiate PvP, etc.

Nah, that‚Äôs what Fortnite is for.

0.02% is drop chance of cards in Ragnarok online as i recall, and they are fundamental part of the game

Really useful with the SBQ. She keeps flying around making it hard to get a good hit chance %. Concentrated fire fixes that.

Yes, and you can get a new mission from him every 24 hours. Today I got the recipe for nuka dark. 
---
Sorry. That sucks. Was hoping it would work but I expected that it was bogus. 
---
Doesn't sound right!  You've checked for parasites.. maybe you used to have Dromedary and Slow Metabolism perks equipped and now you don't?
---
Yeah good luck!

There should be a mark items not for sale function and those item like Atom shop items will not appear in the trade window.
---
Its annoying having every buyer request the clothes im currently wearing.
---
Another one to watch out for is a low lvl player attacking you...then bam the lvl200 guy pops out and kills u. üòÇ
---
Majority of the playerbase knows this is causing server instability. As someones who's been avidly farming the event, I've ran into numerous server crashes. This isn't the individuals internet, It's the server itself completely shutting down. 
---
Why cant this game be decent at all in any way really
---
i am constantly intoxicated. i have all of the alchohol perks at max level (quack surgeon, happy go lucky, party boy ect). it is amazing i have like 20 vintage nukashines, 80 vodkas, 40 whiskies. 
---
5 lol 
---
Thought I said it in a reply but I commented it below 
---
I expected it to be as well. But since it basically was an effortless gamble, no harm done. :)
---
Good idea but I think they will have enough balance problems to sort out without making changes day one... there's a reason they're calling Survival mode a BETA.   Coming from Bethesda, that scares me =)

Think you need plans. I'm still looking for combat armour deep pocketed, impossible to find.

LPT for anyone who gets the quest to make rad ant beer. Go to the giant tea pot. Odds are it'll trigger the "protect the pipes" mission.

You're genuinely a bad person who lies about his income. If you're making that much from "raiding", the you're cheating. There are videos that explain why "raiding" is _not_ profitable. You'r too lazy to play properly and too much of an arrogant, cocky little prick to understand basic human empathy.
---
You are a bad person. You are using exploits. You are harrassing players. People like you are why online games are so detested, and people like you will be banned when Bethesda starts caring about reports. I hope you lose your character permanently. I really do. Because the way you brag on every goddamned post with your exclamation marks and "i'm just being a raider lol" is so extremely arrogant. You're not raiding, you're griefing.
---
 Oh my. I can kill whatever from far away, Instigating Lever Action with the Short Night Vision scope, (useful with Chameleaon) to the hilarious mid ground where I pull out my Auto Grenade Launcher. But both of those pale when I pull out my Serrated Combat Knife and stuff dies ridiculously fast.
---
 Most of the time I'm just pulling them onto me so I can go nuts with my knives. ;)
---
You're not alone.   Quest markers at the DMV have been a problem for me in the past too.   I also wondered whether it was a simulation of bureaucratic 'fog of war' :)
---
I concur, almost always walking through Flatwoods. The only other time I saw him was when I random spawned him trying to get the rare Responder vendor outside Charleston Station (fast travel to Charleston station and follow the train tracks south. Go about halfway down the first red train bridge, then turn back. Assuming nobody has been a clueless shmuck and set their camp nearby, you'll get a random spawn at the broken shack on the right, near the pond. Sometimes its ghouls, super mutants, I saw the Mothman once, and sometimes you get lucky, and it's either the rare Responders vendor, or Grahm.

My hubby and I got to level 200 grinding for anything TSE... Never got it, ended up trading with some fellas we know (cool blokes, we trade a fair bit with them and have good banter)... We're just now getting TS drops but still no TSE which is still pretty cool! I agree with you, love the grind, but this particular event has me rethinking the future events if there isn't a remote chance of getting all the masks... Mind you my camp looks like I've had one too many house parties! üòÇ

What are you be waiting for? I think it's as stable as it's going to get.

My camp on a black titanium deposit on the Ash heap no longer saves. The message reads due to the latest update I need to replace my camp and i had a credit back. Is this true with all deposits or just bad luck on my part? It happened 3 times today. On the plus side I can build my camp blindfolded now
---
I've been farming the event too and get kicked once a day. This is split between sharing internet with no joke ten other people. But it's Bethesda's servers what am I thinking. 
---
I wonder how many people clicked this thinking it was the confirmation of a rare mask drop everyone's been waiting for xD
---
Assuming they ARE dropping at all, a less than 1% drop rate is too fucking low for half the masks in a week long seasonal event. If it was for one? Fine. Or if they were all at like 5%, fine. The was they are now is crap. NOBODY has been able to show that they have one. That isn't right.

I was running speed demon for about 2 weeks and next thing I know I go thru 50 dog food.  Yep, it happens to make you more thirsty when you are moving.

I tried that on release. The bag disappears every time. It persists if you are in a team though. You can drop a bag in your teammates camp.
---
I was first going to say no because of Fortnite, but thinking of the old style dance routines they could introduce would be interesting.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked to find out that General Atomics let Lewis have Biv as a kind of test for the robobrain. Maybe to gauge public reaction to the rather disconcerting sight of a robot with a human‚Äôs brain in a jar, or to see how alcohol affects the robobrain‚Äôs brain.
---
Praise the wise Moth. 
---
That's what I have and it runs fine.  If you're not sure about it buy it from Gamestop used and u have a week to bring it back if you don't like it.
---
You can just edit it in
---
Fair enough, I think I have almost every plan from the event but if you're on later I'll take a look and be willing to trade
---
It doesn't even run well on my 2500$ gaming PC. Don't waste your money. Wish someone had told me how bad the game was before I bought it.
---
My buddy and I did the same thing last night. I got almost 200 violet, 60 cobalt, and 20ish yellowcake. There's not a ton of enemies, and almost no legendary ones, but there was more than enough that I was able to collect all the mass and fluid I needed to stabilize it all
---
There‚Äôs a perk card that allows you to do double damage to players structures, I believe it‚Äôs in agility. Just because you find it unnecessary doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not part of the game. It‚Äôs not hello kitty adventures it‚Äôs fallout and I‚Äôm sorry you had to collect 100 wood and steel to rebuild your base, it honestly takes no time at all so I don‚Äôt get your outrage tbh. 
---
I believe that‚Äôs planned for a future WA release. Along with weapon and item displays, and bobblehead display. 
---
 Explosives are still unbalanced but we should get a balance patch fairly soon. Too weak for what they are, but that's the result of the TSE nerf mostly.
---
First I've heard of it but after looking it up people don't have a definite answer as Todd says it just works. As a pvp player I still wouldn't use it as chems give a better boost and why worry about using a defence card in pve when you can hold more chems or bullets with that blocker spot. Getting more damage out of his gun. That is what he was going for.
---
Agreed, I loved it.
---
I quit the game because of my vats build. Made everything way too easy and it was too strong.
---
The only way I'd play again is if I did no vats and the nee survival mode.
---
There are subs for responders and the enclave. Eoludnt be surprised if the other factions are present too.
---
His girlfriend needs to be educated. Everyone knows 99% of female player characters in Fallout games are played by dudes IRL
---
Im sure its in the there somewhere or in the SOM's, along with common sense, you dont muzzle your head with a loaded M4, butt towards the ground muzzle towards head while leaning on his buddy's vehicle talking bout 76. If that knuckle head would've bumped that bolt release slamming the bolt home, bad things can happen. 
---
That might have been me and my buddy. Did you and a friend show up during the "guard the launch robots" phase? 
---
Didn‚Äôt mean it as crapping it on them.  They themselves have said they like to hear our ideas for improvement.  That‚Äôs all this is.  They particularly seem to appreciate ideas for quality of life improvements.  
---
Why would it not run well on that version of Xbox?
---
It used to be a bug in whitesprings, but they fixed it. Alt-F4 and try again.
---
Ps4: game has its problems but I'm having fun. Wouldn't spend no $60 on it again, but look for it on sale, you'll be able to find a cheap copy. Community is good.
---
Cool guess ill remove this then
---
Did the megasloth get boosted to high level too? Some people said it‚Äôs always 30
---
Are you on PC? If you are there is a glowing meatpile mod that makes them insanely easy to see, it's on Nexus Mods. If not, sorry :(
---
There's food and drink everywhere tho.,go to forest make craft 50 soup
---
As you go up in level, you'll need armor bypassing perks. Some reason the pistols have none.
---
I just wanna be a cowboy :(
---
I only have witch soldier giant man toothy man
---
Sent you a friend request. Never traded before. I can give it to you FOC tho. 
---
You may be spreading yourself a bit too thin if you're trying to spec for both ranged and melee.
---
Your theory from above won't really work in nuke zones. 
---
Anyway, if you're having fun then everything is fine. It's just that it's impossible to kill stuff with rifles as fast as you can kill stuff with vats+rifles; which is the topic of the thread.
---
That would be great. Let me know when you're on. Thanks!
---
Small correction, you can actually get 1400/day minus travel costs. Responder, raider, Whitesprings, Enclave, Harper's, Watoga station, and Phoenix the BOS bot. Graham shares caps with Watoga station, and the traveling robo vendor shares with the responders. 
---
Nah they are great...im waiting when my plague walker will get armor with those many eyes ....and holes
---
Someone said that once u leave the server the bag disappears..black titanium is really needed other than for anti armor weapons I think..u can just sell it 
---
Rifle+vats crit build= OHK 
---
unless they have one of the OP PvP builds 
---
OP said bugged, not balanced. And TSE weapons are fine the way they are.
---
I haven't, never even thought about that! Thank you!
---
Now that I have a little farm of 12 razorgrain, food and water are never an issue.
---
maybe its problem of your overpriced toaster ?
---
I'll try that, thank you!
---
Yes rename the weapons, and power armor. Easy way to figure out what you have in your stash.
---
I mean, at this point, the sloth is more rewarding than the non-existent rare masks, so why not?
---
Just yes. You win, that is a life improvement
---
Yep you can, that was part of my method
---
My friend is running on 24+ hours without sleep trying his chances of getting one of these rare masks. He knows he has a 0.03% chance of obtaining one, yet he keeps trying. I'm honestly worried about his mental and physical health at this point.
---
Thanks a lot, Bethesda. /s
---
I got help from the dude above but if you want to help me i need 45,10mm or 50, or even fusion cores if you can, my id is sofiantobias01
---
(Feel free to correct me if wrong, just based on what I‚Äôve witnessed) With the Gulpers, they come in 3 different sizes. The small ones are I believe level 15-30, the large are 30+, and then the legendary ones are the biggest, but not too noticeable bigger than the large gulpers. 
---
Would be nice if everyone who participated received one random rare mask at the event's end. Then you could trade for the one you want. It may not be ideal, but if you're one of the poor saps who's completed the event 300 times with no rare mask, all isn't totally lost.
---
The problem isn't with the quest as you surmised, but the buggy nature with which Bethesda does everything. The loading times, the crashing, incorrect quest markers/non-existent quest markers. The whole thing was just a mess.
---
Yeah the lost could of been worst. Do you guys think it would work if I put stuff in some type of container? Locker maybe in a train station and come back for it.
---
Oh please, if associating a drug with a strong "buff" is not glorifying it then I don't know what is.
---
Thats funny. ign jasonlandon12345. I'll be online later
---
We hate you too, no worries!
---
tons of crashes/dcs/hangups since my buddy and I started playing again for the Fasnacht event.
---
D.C. wouldn‚Äôt really be like the Glowing Sea at the moment. The Glowing Sea is the impact site of a single, high-yield nuke. Nothing of that caliber ever hit D.C., which was peppered with a number of smaller bombs.
---
I have a theory that Beth doesn‚Äôt care about scamming in game as much as they might hint at.
---
They never said anything about scamming as being a ban-able offense, and it wasn‚Äôt even a reportable offense until a recent update, so my thought process is that Beth must not care about it much at all.
---
Additionally that would be a pretty difficult thing to police from Beth‚Äôs point of view.
---
It‚Äôd be all good if they‚Äôd work on prevention instead of damage control, they need to add a proper way to trade item for item like every other online game.
---
Do you have hard bargain? You can get an easy 200 caps every day with that card maxed out. Just collect the eggs at the mothman museum, cook them and sell 25 of them It‚Äôs not much but it‚Äôs a start.
---
I believe they go away on their own eventually if you don‚Äôt keep consuming alcohol or chems 
---
Yea, and then you have to walk away and the other person is pissed. Didn‚Äôt want to sell my Vampire‚Äôs light exploding machine gun, they were upset.
---
That coule be a great idea but it's also flawed
---
What is the recommended level to be at for the quest? 
---
So true...
---
Train stations are your own stash. You can try putting it in the overseers stash. Apparently it stays that way. Try it out on something unimportant and see if it stays.
---
Wish I've done this, happened about 5 times to me
---
I think I remember that it was like that in 4
---
You can still tag the sloth and mop up the rest. I get the parades a drag at this point and those rewards are nearly unobtainable. Id just rather not fail the mission at the end which has happened.
---
I've been known to do that, dump my stuff in a container, fast travel to a stash box, fast travel back, get my stuff. Works as long as nobody else loots it in the meantime!
---
I'm level 151 and I wouldn't consider your level "no life-ing"
---
What is the benefits of junkies? Is it as useful as bloodied? That is the question.
---
Your buddy is still pretty close to 250 so it's not /that/ unbelievable
---
Whenever people do this to me I set the price at almost triple the market value. They all seem to take the hint except for one guy who bought my TSE pump for 9k. Kinda felt bad but not really
---
Generally on Xbox, the common going rate is 30 caps for Fluorescent and Yellowcake and 35 or 40 for Violet. 
---
I undercut and sell at 20 and 25. I know on PS4, prices are higher and on PC, even higher still. 
---
Molotovs my friend
---
 ROTFLMFAO. There are many ways to skin a cat. The popular ones are not that great really.
---
 I get shit on in nuke zones because I kill ghouls so fucking fast that no one else gets any. I try not to but its very difficult. ;)
---
 I build balanced builds as this is my game and that's how I like it. The only thing that actually threatens me are some Bloodied builds but I have no interest in getting killed all the time for a godly hit and PvP is not my focus. When I pull out the Instigating Hardened Lever Action it hits like a truck and I will often get 4 of my 5 shots to one shot whatever.
---
 I hunt Scorchbeasts for sport. The more the merrier, but usually some will run. The Lever Action, hip shot, brings em' down. I figure I get about 60% of em' into her majesty as I run and gun her.
---
 I will not use VATS, as for me ... its cheating. ;)
---
As much as I hate to say it. 2019 is full of liberals and children who have 0 self control and are influenced by everything. This game will become ‚Äòtoo controversial for allowing you to light a cigarette,‚Äô or something stupid like that. 
---
Sad but true
---
I like nuking the dry lake bed in the toxic valley. Try to hit the water park with the edge of the blast. That's my favorite non traditional spot.
---
I hear the nuka cola factory is pretty good, too.
---
Yah I had only one explosive drop for me and it was very cool. It was a black power rifle not a two shot, but still awesome. I have a collection of legit two shot 1\* stuff I got on drops, but seem to only be getting lame 2\* and 3\* armor right now and no weapons? Can't wait to see what the legendary vendor is going to do with all this armor. I don't mind the grind for legendaries because you will eventually get something awesome. 
---
I just got Paladin.  Seems they is next after Officer.  And it further makes me think it‚Äôs going in a set order with no repeats.  Not sure what will happen when I get Elder. 
---
Nope. Nowhere. Stop trying to nuke my house...
---
The D.C. region being referred to as the Capitol Wasteland is really not relevant to the name of the Wastelanders update. *Everywhere* in Fallout is called the wasteland. It is just a term for the world in general, especially when referring to wilderness or uncivilized areas.
---
Those files for the Chinese Assault Rifle have also been around since Fallout 4, so their inclusion is not proof of anything.
---
Taking Adderall in Camp should immediately put you in build mode and not able to leave until you‚Äôve changed the location of every carpet, decoration, and piece of furniture.
---
Terrorizing the wasteland one phobia at a time. 
---
The debuff has no timer on it like diseases. I've also held them for several hours without them disappearing, they only went away after I died.
---
 Oh I agree, its just explosives suffered rather too much in that nerf.
---
 Who knows what bugged means anyway. ;)
---
&gt;I'll have to try this. Everytime I use i die.
---
Get the fireproof perk. At rank 3 you can fire one at your feet and barely take any damage. 
---
On or two grenades and they are all dead.  And of course as soon as you kill the sloth the protect the root portion is done and it is removed from the list so I am certain it doesn‚Äôt matter if the wolves are still alive.  Sloth dies on seconds and event is done regardless of what the wolves do after that.  
---
I believe it adds around 20 to 25 damage for every withdrawal affect you have on you.
---
My mic might be dead.
---
cheers :) 
---
I survive on razorgrain soup now. 
---
I‚Äôm a lone wanderer too. I like going far off the beaten path to explore 
---
&gt; -Raider who does this kind of thing
---
Yeah no. This shouldn't be a thing. You're not roleplaying as a raider by abusing the fact that workshop pvp is very poorly made. 
---
Plenty locked doors at whitezprings.  Can't wait to get inside them 
---
That sucks, but thanks for the info.
---
I just molitov the smaller animals but the wolves still get through. By the time I can turn around to the sloth it's dead. I've done 20 parades and got items from 2 sloths.
---
There actually could be some positive effects to assign to them.
---
They could make it so your aim is steadier while smoking, like in MGS1 and 2.
---
They could make it so smoking reveals laser wire traps, also like in MGS1 and 2.
---
Did you have 10% free budget before you tamed it ? I haven't tamed since the patch , i need a dog !! :)
---
I'm on xbox. I can switch between a level 145, a level 40 something, or a level 20ish depending on what you want to do. 
---
Depends on what type of game you like.  If you like rpg/slash shooters yes.  The game really doesnt do anything great but it is a fun experience.  Have you played other fallouts because it plays just like the previous fallouts.  But it not everyone's cup of tea.  It is a lot slower than say cod.
---
I have the original xbox and the game runs fine.  The only problem I have with the game right now is the server stability.  I will loose connection once or twice in a sitting.  Not a big deal.  Log back in and you will be right where you left off.
---
The game is worth 60 but I'm really suprised if you couldnt get it for 20 or 30 bucks somewhere.  Buy it but look around before you spend 60.
---
Steadier aim while shooting.
---
Is a usable Gandalf pipe asking too much?
---
Just this morning I put 1k plastic and 200 ballistic fiber in a cash register and had someone stand next to it while I changed characters. 
---
Nice!  I just got the excavator power armor plans, which is why I was down that way in the first place.  I‚Äôm way short on screws to craft it all, though.
---
My voice comms was SUPER loud, so I turned it down from 100% to 80% resulting in what I would call 1% actual volume. Couldnt hear a damn thing, even the guy yelling into his mic literally hurting my ears before going from 100-80%.
---
Had to turn my master volume from 40% up to 100%, "chat" back to 100% and everything else down to &lt;30% and now I can just barely, sometimes hear people talking on mic.
---
I have yet to hook up a mic -- so I've not heard a soul.  I always wonder if someone's yelling at me when they come up and I awkwardly don't respond to their request.
---
I'm level 24, dont like playing alone much either. Psn is BrynnTheBest
---
It is funny but with this recent patch the load times and frame rate seem like it took a hit. But it is worth getting if found on discount. 
---
Yup. Its definitely my computer that has no problems  with any other games that is the problem. Hell maybe my fiber internet is the reason I get dropped from the server constantly. Also, the game isn't glitchy, I'm just a really bad player (along with everyone else on this sub who point out problems and glitches) I like Bethesda. I like most of the elder scrolls games and fallout 3 and 4, but I will not sit here and praise a game that is so broken and neglected that it isnt worth the money. Get your head out of your ass. If we let companies get away with shit like this it will only get worse. And FYI I'm running 2 radeon RX580 graphics cards (crossfire on  and recently upgraded to 64gb of ram. And my internet connection is 1gbps fiber line. The problem isn't on my end.
---
Take the armor pieces off the frame and you can store it all if you are too low of a level to equip it. 
---
This. I only found the elusive beast this way. Happy hunting.
---
Take a look at this:
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/alxtbz/am_i_the_only_one_staring_at_empty_water_purifiers/
---
One shot into the sloth when it spawns then I turn around and throw a couple grenades down the street.  
---
Usually I can toss an orbital strike down there right about the time the marching music stops and it goes off as soon as the stings and wolves are running thru and they all die. 
---
People still smoke? That‚Äôs hilarious 
---
On xbox one i have done this event alone pretty often. Usually barley win and get nothing good for it. So anyone on xbox wanna do it im down !
---
The problems started as soon as the first Wild Appalachia patch was released, before quantum paint was discovered. 
---
Overencumbered, in a building far away from my camp
---
Had no choice /:
---
Lol hmu I could use them 
---
Looks like a cliff above Cranberry Bog!
---
I would recommend going east from a location above the cliff before the bog.
---
That depends. I can't be providing BOS secrets to just anyone. If you can tell me the purpose of the Brotherhood and show up in uniform I would give it to you for 350. Otherwise, 500 caps.
---
Ends on the 26th I think
---
Oh I know, I've been creating them here and there to decon for the mod plans.
---
I don't have a mic, so they wouldn't know if I'm farting in their general direction.
---
Me too!
---
But I recently picked up another set of T60 (4/6 pieces) to paint with BOS paint to check it out. Now I'm back to playing the drop a bunch of PA until I get the one I want.
---
They combine into like a storage container for water if you play the game for an hour and came back you would have water in each one to egual a total of 60 
---
Because there is a better version of xbone out there.  I havent had any issues with my original but I've heard that people have issues running newer games like red dead.  Lots of stuttering and framerates issues.
---
Lol, me
---
Except ultra-light combat torso for some reason. That one's a scrap unlock.
---
That is one expensive dump. I would have slow walked my ass to the nearest gas kr train station. Or dumped that weight in junk and ammo. 
---
Saw an event running 10 minutes ago on xbox
---
Agreed! Not sure what kind of loser would finds this entertaining... maybe someone who should spend less time playing games.
---
Tesla the ground :o
---
I'll hold it for you for the next week while we navigate meeting up in game.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 I‚Äôd be glad to!
---
Username is smokingsince88. Send me a friend request and I‚Äôll be glad to hit you up when I have some. 
---
How much data did you need after you got offcier l?
---
never considered that -- didn't know of that "feature".  Most the awkward times is when they're standing next to me, but the completely random ones now make a bit more sense.
---
Imagine the dosh they'd make just dropping a skin mesh into an editor and changing the hue.
---
OFC detailed skins would be much more appreciated though.
---
Grahm can have these plans if you come across him! 
---
So, to summarize, you broke into someone else's camp, and thought you were not only stealing all their junk, but also all their weapons and armor and plans, and mods. 
---
Heh. Couldn't think of a more fitting outcome. 
---
Speed demon will always get you. Slow metabolism an all night long helps. I drink boiled water because I go through so much and rad away in so abundant.
---
Sorry to break the news to you, but there are lots of stupid people in the world with similar personal problems. 
---
I wasn‚Äôt drunk but one time early on I found a camp and found tons of stuff just sitting in a bear proof container. I took all of it and ran... until I got to my stash box and was like, wtf?
---
Remember, only one Enclave has eyes in the hills.
---
Agreed! Factions‚Äôll be a blast!
---
Yeah /: but with no barter at the time and etc
---
Junk was worth its weight
---
Tbh i like my new x01 anyways
---
Had more downfalls in that pursuit LOL
---
Lost a t51 nuka cola arm, and failed the first time trying to get the quantum plans
---
Frustrating night
---
Praises be to the one person in this thread that is smart enough to put us all in our place.   üôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè
---
I thought I was ready for one, but I had no chance once the third one showed up.
---
I too, have a razorgrain crop at my camp, but I run over to the General's Steakhouse and steal their corn, come back and start brewing nukashine with the additional bits needed, eventually getting vintage Nukashine and a blackout üí•
---
Id start around devils backbone and get as high up as possible.
---
You‚Äôre a saint, sir.
---
Done 3 in the past hour. 
---
As others have said the bloodied builders are getting those crazy numbers. Other builds do those dmg but arnt as visible because they come from sneak bonus (3.5x dmg) or just vats crit builds. If your full auto I have a furious explosive handmade that'll do wonders for the right price
---
Hahahahaha! I love this story. 
---
You should get side effects of smoking like alcohol, reduced sprint, +1 chrisma with the opposite sex, characters face ages 
---
You can find the same.bones under the water in Big Maw in the Mire.
---
They probably couldn't get it animated properly anyway.
---
Over by the river there is s spawn point, by the crashed truck
---
Overseers camp 
---
This is the problem in America today. Your priorities seem messed up. You can give a 7 year old drugs to perform better in school but gluten is bad. You have more homeless than the population of most European countries but you stress about people‚Äôs sexual preferences. You can show brutal murders on TV and video games but smoking is a no-no...
---
Probably the forest near flatwoods
---
bad idea.... if u think its a good spot ...thousands other will think same way and u end up changing your place every game.   But if u rly want that... choose a city ..and put it as close as possible..and as visible as possible
---
Cannibal and Carnivore takes care of most food needs, nosh a corpse for a quick refill. Thirst, I also get boiled water pretty abundantly so ditto there.
---
Why don't they just ensure that any scrapped bulked material also returns 2 plastic....this would ensure that any scrapped bulked material could easily be rebulked again. I personally would jump on a cheat to replicate plastic now since Fallout 76 has with the "scrap all" destroyed SOOO much plastic for me and forced me to waste time that I wouldn't consider it a cheat and I usually hates cheating in any game.
---
I just don't want it to be hidden. I prefer it to be in the open.
---
finally some recognition for my greatness.
---
I have my trusty mutant explosive combat shotty and I love it! Got it from a drop! Hardly get anything explosive so it was exciting! I'm hanging for the legendary vendor! I got some awesome stuff to get rid of LOL!
---
Took awhile, did it?   Seems odd. 
---
..  Don't leave us in suspense, what is it?
---
Well, I did play as much as 8 hours a day sometimes. So I would still consider it that. I just never power leveled whitesprings nuke zones, I spent most of my time roaming around the map trying to find new stuff or cool legendary combinations
---
Sometimes they either don't spawn here, or run away. Like they know what's coming. ¬¨\_¬¨
---
If this is the case, I tend to have luck finding them up on the hill opposite the church. Sometimes they'll spawn on the floor above the turn-in point.
---
you can actually tame with a full budget, but a warning on that is if you do even if you remove an item your budget will still be listed as full so you won't be able to put it back.
---
Psst. Pumpkin grenades. Just one well timed throw will kill off those pesky wolves and stingwings. 
---
Got the idea from all the complaints about nuking Helvetia. Been doing it since I ran out of orbital strikes.
---
But the Brahmin in a fertilizer station isn't a pet, is it?
---
Walk through a door into a bunch of punji boards and missile turrets.
---
Yeah Xbox unfortunately 
---
You guys get all the fun stuff lol
---
That
---
Yeah, it's from somewhere between Cranberry Bog and The Mire, but I've checked those cliffs for days and I couldn't be able to find. I'm getting really mad with this xD
---
But you have to wait for him to shush so you can activate it.
---
Simple fix (and should be applied to ‚ÄòRest‚Äô as well) ‚Äî instead of a button click it should require you to hold down the button (similar to turning on your Pip-boy light.
---
Honestly 
---
Calibrated Shocks for T-60 is one the mods I see most often for sale at vendors (e.g. Watoga Station), and even in the wild. Really no need to buy the plans IMHO, and you don't need to farm flux either. CalShos for other PAs, though: I never see them. Took me ages for my pair of Excav Shocks back then.
---
With the pvp servers popping us I was thinking of the cannibal carnivorous path while drinking out of puddles lol
---
That boiled water truly goes a long way.
---
Turn on subtitles to help you with deciphering the mumbling drunk entertainment unit.
---
That's awesome! You did a great job on it. Wouldn't be able to tell it wasn't a real station if I just stumbled upon it. 
---
Yep, up the hillside is where I ended up after running up and down the riverbed like an idiot. Then opossums, squirrels, and chickens, oh my.
---
Like what do want to do ...eat them?...if your expectations are a smoking animation..yes your a bridge to far....
---
Yah we had two guys who weren't included in our Fasnacht event and they were getting in the way trying to get people to hit them to start PVP. I hit the guy trying to get some Radtoads and he one hit me with whatever over powered explosive he had. At lvl 15 I have two high level guys destroyed my camp and then attacked me until I eventually died I was even talking to the guys like it sucks, but I'll rebuild and I respect your game its fallout and fallout needs raiders. But the two guys at our Fasnacht event that shit is just stupid.
---
Becsuse FO76 SUX, and who cares man that game blows, it pisses me off how hard they try to justify this when its broken as brittle bones. 
---
nah he was specifically trying to block MoC
---
Tried it, work it did not
---
Will hope in future tries it may pan out
---
Same, I was saving up for one, but then they released all this t-60 skins so I decided to just get all the t-60 mod plans.
---
\*puts mah hata-blockas on\*
---
Leaving this here so I can find the stats.
---
Just like real life.
---
Gimme a single malt, water on the side.
---
(Just water, I'm not going to go all Jack D. Ripper on you about the kind of water).
---
That is south of the monorail elevator 
---
From the fast travel point on the other side of the bridge behind the house with the baker bot collecting eggs, head the opposite way of town and there are dozens of small animals that constantly respawn.  You can get more intestines than you will ever need. 
---
Dunno rly.... but its kinda funny iam completely not experience this kind of problems on my ps4... xD but yeh i know what u mean :) Im not here to prize for nothing, but also pure hating is not fun 
---
I have a smoking mod for FO4. You get like ten old cigar boxes, 5 or so cigarette cartons, a pipe and tobacco pouch, and your character can smoke either a pipe, cigar, or cigarette. Oh yeah, it gives you a fat stogie animation as well. 
---
i figured this out earlier, it opens from the inside but now on the other side of the stairs so i can walk in peacefully now.
---
The excavator PA?
---
Just did it on PS4
---
nah ....please wait when i get my armor skin :3 i will terrorizing your dreams ever after
---
i figured it out earlier, it still opens to the inside but it's now on the other side of the stairs so i can walk in peacefully
---
Ahh I forgot to add that one, yeah I already know that one also.
---
And X01 Power Armor. 
---
&gt; I mean alcohol itself is just a side effect of rotting ~~fruits/grains~~ sugar.
---
You can ferment any sugar, no matter where it comes from.  even animal sugars.
---
If you are in dire need of an event just log out and log back in while you are in Helvetia.
---
Where is that one at?
---
Funny, I have three of them. People who don't know that they can be upgraded regularly sell them to vendors. On a related note, I also own three All Rise lvl 50: sure, once you find your Instigating or Bloodied Super Sledge with faster swing and 90% weight reduction, you don't longer need your All Rise, but as for me, I couldn't just let them sit in a vendor's inventory, ready to be deleted during the next inventory or server reset...
---
You gotta have someone in the exact same spot as you to keep the area from despawning your stuff. It helps if they actually enter the bag menu but don't take anything.
---
You quit, change characters and join your friend's world. So long as they haven't left the area your bag will be there.
---
I've got some friends who showed me how to do it, we use this method to transfer stuff to mules. Have yet to lose anything.
---
Well to be hones i believe Enclave will drop some additional nukes on us, and atmosphere will go uckd, and we will encounter a winter. You know, warm clothes, no more power armors (unless moded to keep warm), more options to build warm shelter...
---
I think it's the event. But yes, the stability is quite bad
---
You can find the plans for the BOS recon rifle at the terminal just outside Defiance. 
---
Whitesprings Bunker in the Armory 
---
Not launch day, more like launch month. 
---
I'm on xbox and I got the same problem. At least 1 disconnect a session. The other day though it was being super terrible. Every time I tried to enter Hornwright Industrial HQ it booted me not just out of the session but all the way to the xbox home screen. Eventually let me so I could finish the side quest I was on.  
---
You'll feel like shit for a week or so, mate. Not gonna lie. Then a couple of weeks after that, you'll start coughing up all the residual shit in your lungs. It's grim to see, but it will strengthen your resolve. You'll be amazed and disgusted by it. That'll last about a week. 
---
BUT, I promise you, a month from now you'll feel so much healthier, you'll sleep so much more deeply. It felt like I'd had someone sat on my chest and they'd just got up. It's really that big of a difference. You'll catch yourself at that top of a flight of stairs and think, "I'm not even out of breath wtf?" 
---
Keep going, mate. Identify when you're at your weakest to caving in and having a smoke, and be disciplined. For me, I could go a few days without a cigarette, but after a couple of pints at the pub, I'd go all in and smoke a pack just while I was there. Or after a big meal out. I promise you the cravings, however harsh they seem now, will fuck off. You'll feel brand new a month from now.
---
When I said ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù I meant launch month. 
---
The character holding the items was deleted to destroy duped items I was given. So technically I'm over the 100k counter but also the items no longer exist.
---
I think it might be near the monorail elevator location
---
Did you asked him if he did do all tasks or just normal like people missed tasks (for example, other person took all monsters out but tasks were completed itself)?
---
I can imagine some metro-like gameplay, like having to wear a gas mask in the overworld and keep an eye on the filter. Maybe some radiation too with some rad Hotspots. Loot should be more scarce and all enemies very high level like 70+ so it's gonna be high risk high reward.
---
I would love a much more dangerous and dark atmosphere, some more survival aspects and generally harder gameplay.
---
I have 8 Power Armors and i only really use one. So i dont really see how your type of opinion matters. Those asking for a stand want the ability to display their PA. Whether they are rare or not, i still want to show off my hoarde to people.
---
Sorry for the accidental bait
---
Neither seemed to have a mic, so I didn't really pester them about it.
---
Have you tried setting the resolution in the fallout76prefs.ini? 
---
Great job kicking the habit. I've been smoking for around 40 years. The damage is done and the stress of quitting is way too much for me to deal with. I do have health issues that are compounded by smoking although not caused by smoking if you get my meaning. I wish anyone who is quitting all the best in the world. I really do. 
---
This has happened to me so many times that I have given up on the workshop feature almost entirely. Occasionally I‚Äôll claim a power plant to get fusion cores, but I don‚Äôt do any rebuilding and what not because I know that as soon as I do I will get disconnected, and waste my time and resources. 
---
No, you don't. 
---
?
---
I've done it (often half-assed) four times, twice today.  Why do you have to server hop?
---
I love grinding and a constant feel of progression. In other BETHESDA titles I certainly collect a bunch of shit. Mind sharing some of the issues tho? I get a resounding yes to get the game but not v info on what could be bad, and I don't wanna look at "what's wrong with fallout 76" threads cause I know I'll hear the worst
---
whole world like a one big raid? Sweet....lvl 100+ monsters would suit me just fine
---
I have an absolute ton of fusion cores. I can give you a dozen or so probably. PSN Mootsmcboots (in case I don't get a chance to add you first)
---
Probably have a boat load of lead and gunpowder too (I rarely craft ammo)
---
What do you mean I won't see anyone on the map? I'm a bit confused here is the game.... dead?
---
I have belief that the Super Mutants are making meat-hooch in their bags of meat.
---
Cheers
---
And the said something about how *violent* it was in the commonwealth...
---
I figured, don‚Äôt know how I missed this one.  I only really use Power armor in nuke zones anyway so never really had a want to find them
---
Yo that would be perfect, i will add you rightaway
---
So they‚Äôre only good for more capacity?
---
I'm on PC but have also noticed issues as well. The new thing is the game stops instantly and when I log out back in my junk is gone. It has happened maybe four times since the last major patch. A bit baffled about how to resolve it actually. 
---
I wouldn't sell mine for less than 100 each. Maybe 200 for that precious violet.
---
The antique shop has a couple out back.
---
Thanks! Missed this one
---
Yeah, next to you is def just someone looking for a group. But those randoms from far away probably just want a ride. Fallout hitch hiking lol.
---
You should give it a shot at some point. It‚Äôs easily one of the best pieces of Fallout content.
---
You ain‚Äôt wrong!
---
I waited because at launch the general consensus was it was a cluster \*\*\*\*. BUT, I gave it the benefit of doubt to improve since almost every open-world shared game launches with problems, just the nature of these titles 
---
I can't wait for those 4 horsemen armor paints. Saving my atoms for those currently.
---
You can learn the helmet mod but not for the actual armor through scrapping.
---
When the game launched there was an XP glitch you could disarm a trap for infinite XP if you sat there and kept doing it
---
Demo expert 5 helps a ton with TSE shotguns. 
---
I scrapped a left arm armor piece. How could I learn a helmet mod while scrapping an armor piece?
---
If anyone kills him, you'll have to John Wick them.
---
Yes. Smoking kills. What the hell is wrong with you?
---
If you want violet, nuke the area around the water park. It's full of ferns. Put the water park just inside the zone at 10 O clock, and then wander the area to gather 100+ violet in 20 minutes. 
---
3 times today alone, it's bad, like first day launch bad.
---
Just started this quest this morning. Glad for the heads up. 
---
read latest info... in survival mod u wont see anyone on the map this is what i said
---
I guess i'll prep my hunters long coat and sunglasses for his inevitable demise. 
---
/full agreement 
---
Eh no, did it before? Have starched genes and a decon arch at my camp, haven‚Äôt lost my mutations yet
---
Level 226. Probably close to 1000 hours. Only seen him once and he ran away. Its the only creature in fallout 76 I haven't killed.
---
Stone arc. 
---
If only you could use a pencil.
---
Happy hunting my friend!
---
I believe you need to be twice the level of a creature to tame it, but the strongest would probably be a mirelurk queen, although the spawn might not be tame.
---
&gt;  we should at least have more damage to compensate for the INCREDIBLY slow reload speed.
---
No you shouldn't.
---
Stop whining.
---
I'll sell you 7 of each variety for 50 each if you're on xbox. 
---
The issues seem to be different for whatever platform you play on, I'm on xbox and there are stuttering sections which I've heard are just on the original xbox and not the xbox1. Makes sense eh? You might want to look through some of the older posts for your platform specific issues. Incomplete questlines and bugged rewards seem to be the most common complaint generally.
---
4 horseman? never heard..never saw...propably wont happen... ;( but sounds pro as fk....i want be the rotting one xD
---
He will spawn at spawn points. Two of the spawn points that I've seen him the most at are the one between the overseers camp and Flatwoods and the spawn point at the fork in the road south of Grafton Train Station. Just server hope a bunch and eventually he will show up, although after the patch that changed the way plans spawn at vendors, his selection has been lacking.
---
The black Devil one is the only one I want 
---
Omg, I love that door so much. If I somehow win the lottery, I‚Äôm definitely getting a man cave with that nuka cola machine door. 
---
That would be sick tho
---
Where not to find them?
---
Thats exactly what i mean. Also in this mode they should wipe out all events. No magical power plants or airdrops from space. Instead there should be very strong boss events where all players team up. Maybe some preparation events before, to get some benefits for the fight.
---
Example: Boss is a giant much more mutated mirelurk queen. Pre events could be something like repairing some military artillery nearby, poisoning her lake with a special chemical mixture to weaken her, attract a horde of enemies with some kind of incense to distract her.
---
Each preparation would give the players a significant bonus as a reward for traveling around big parts of the map to get Artillerie parts/ammo or chemicals (fast travel should obviously be disabled) 
---
It‚Äôs my camp 
---
It drives me insane when it happens. So slow to escape the bed/chair.
---
Oh man that‚Äôs awesome. Well fuck they should get on that then. 
---
Well you‚Äôre asking FO76 to be like a military simulator, which due to the lore, I doubt will happen.
---
Scum is a survival game where you‚Äôre a convict on an island in Croatia and a hunger games set up where you‚Äôre being watched for a tv show, there‚Äôs puppets aka zombies that are controlled by the watchers.
---
It‚Äôs you against the mech robots that guard military institutions, zombies and other players.
---
Killing people or doing actions that you aren‚Äôt highly skilled in result in fame points which enable you to do various things.
---
The main premises are survival and combat which are both pretty MilSim orientated.
---
You can make pretty much anything yourself as your survival skill increases.
---
It has a lot of the stuff you mentioned and also goes into detail on weapons in a way that‚Äôs pretty satisfying.
---
An example being with the sniper rifle - the distance you‚Äôre at, settings on the scope and current level of the wind matter.
---
If you‚Äôre wet, you move slower etc etc 
---
There‚Äôs limitations on how far and fast you can run based on your endurance and running skills, which raise over time with use.
---
Your character gains or loses weight based on caloric intake, recently someone tried to become the fattest person in scum, they died of a heart attack.
---
It is just about to introduce base building, although currently you can fortify and lock down existing structures by building fortifications and putting locks on the doors.
---
For anyone with a military history that likes games that are based on that or have elements of that is highly suggest scum for the survival itch and Escape from Tarkov for the fps itch, as they actually partnered with a gun manufacturer to make all the guns legit in every way possible.
---
When I first say the 4 paint jobs after the developers room was raided people on pc called the paints the 4 horsemen of the apocalypse paints.
---
Those are screws, not gears.
---
&gt;That would be one bad ass end game content...only for 100-200 lvl+ with scaling monsters.... xD oh my god i should work for them...i have great ideas... xD
---
No problem. It's great for helping lowbies because you can craft a fully modded level 1 or 5 recon rifle for the material cost of a base hunting rifle. It comes with a hardened receiver, perf Mag, recon scope, etc and costs almost nothing to build. 
---
I hope you get lucky and find one!
---
Yeah, if an amateur modder can do it, why can't the pros? Am I right? 
---
I believe loot is completely random, so your best choice is probably whitespring golf club or around south east corner (watoga and around)  
---
&gt; telephone *[no gears]*, typewriter *[screws]*, hotplate *[screws]* and clipboard *[springs]*  you see.
---
If he follows your advice he's screwed (unintentional pun). 
---
good to know.   someone gave me the marsupial mutation in a bottle ages ago.   now that i have starched genes 2 i'm gonna use it :)
---
As i said before what you're claiming here will never work in nuked whitesprings for example. 
---
If you're going melee on the ghouls you've already lost the challenge. A Vats rifleman can kill the mobs before you get the chance to close the distance. Glowing ghouls = one shot each. 
---
If you're using non-vats rifles you lost the challenge again. You can't physically be faster than the vats aiming. 
---
&gt; The Lever Action, hip shot, brings em' down
---
I **am** a vats rifle user. If you're shooting from the hip chances are you're not hitting the head 100% of the time. Even with instigating a torso shot won't one shot glowing ghouls. It **needs** to be a headshot. Source: myself and my nearly 200 hours of using rifles, my instigating lever rifle and my quad lever rifle(when the damage from perk cards activates, the quad is able to one-shot things too). I'm well aware of the potential of a lever action rifle when used correctly. If there's one thing i know in this game it's stuff about rifles and what you're saying it's simply not true.
---
Also here's a cool fact, to one-shot heavily armored mobs lever action rifles aren't that good, even if it's an instigating one. You can't mod it to make it perforating. Meanwhile a hunting rifle does have that option, making it more suitable for one shoting literally everything. 
---
&gt; I will not use VATS, as for me ... its cheating. ;)
---
Yeah i noticed you're feeling a bit superior. 
---
But them items arnt only in the game for a week, that's the main problem we have a week to get them before they're gone
---
I'll be home in a bit. If no one else comes in I'll walk you through it. 
---
No, as long as it‚Äôs a 2* starched jeans
---
.
---
That works for event "teams?" Never occurred to me
---
ummm are there any photos of those? xD damn i missed some cool content then.... Oh wait...there was one that was green-ish ..broken, rotten etc right? Father Nurgle like it...Father Nurgle wants it....we will spread the rot..
---
I think each time you kill the SBQ u get one random combat armor piece.
---
System? Effects you want? We demand input... 
---
oh i agree 100%. i hate it so very much but what can we do unless they do something for us
---
Rose quest, same as area where she is is kinda mid low lvl... you rly shouldnt be there at lvl 18 solo. Im saying you shouldnt but lately i saw 2 guys jumping at the very south east of the map at their lvl 19-20 ...so what do i know xD
---
Nobody knows anything about the masks. That's the truth.
---
I've found that if they are not near the old truck, then they are usually down un the creek bed. Usually being the operative word here. 
---
I dont remember it beig that high. I did the Rose questline at around level 25? 
---
Heres my alternative. When we get player vending also setup the same machine over at the whitesprings so there is a common place to find all player vending for that server.
---
Just started using cannibal and carinvore, handy combo.
---
For water, I visited a nuke zone and picked up a bunch of flowers which decayed into inert flux. Weigh 0.2 and give 25% water :)
---
Few ionized meat from the nuke zone is handy too they don't spoil and also weigh 0.2
---
/u/ladydevann this is a bit of a nasty bug. Scrapping certain items makes them impossible to pick up again when they respawn, regardless of server.
---
Examples: wood, beer steins, beeswax
---
If there was more people would have them.
---
Battle Royal mode. There was text somewhere where Todd was asked if he would ever do it and he essentially gave a maybe type answer. 
---
No. Devs posted its better for all robots to survive.
---
There is also a legacykilla youtube that briefly talks about it
---
Nah i believe its completely RNG (with all robots alive i got 3 different masks + beret) ..like a loot boxes :P 75% for normal 24% for uncommon 0.9% for rare and 0.1% for legendary :P  ehhh good old lootboxes
---
I think all your purifiers together produce 60/h, don't expect hundreds of water in just one hour. I had 5 of these, now i lnly got 2 and i get about the same amount and never carry less than 100.
---
Oh so you dont want to play with players at lvl 100+? xD we are not good for you? Is that what u saying? xD
---
Yeah but everyone builds there
---
