Glad to hear it. I did not see that. Thanks for the heads up.

Walking backwards should accelerate AP generation
---
I don’t have 2SE weapons. Just saying that if it’s an equivalent of trials in ESO, I will need to team up and I’m sure the others will most likely have them.
---
Doesn't seem to be, in particular when you are overcumbered. But I really cannot be sure
---
Same here.. Yesterday I had 9 blue screen crashes before I gave up. Sometimes within 10 min of launch others more than an hour later.
---
Too little too late!
---

---
I was though with this game before Xmas, good riddence
---
If I recall correctly, you're looking for a paper note near a terminal - not a terminal entry itself. I have never repeated this quest though. 
---
Maybe it's meant to give you a nudge to the Mayor for a Day quest, but it's kinda nutty for it to continue to spawn after I've completed everything in Watoga.
---
Reportedly they do that. 
---
Go to map and options. It works by, u cant hurt others and hard to kill people in it
---
If I could upvote you 100 times for this post, I would. 
---
I’ll let you know if I find something 
---
Why do dupers even play? Once you have everything, there's nothing left to do in the game lol
---
Is the paint available for T-51b?
---
 The fact that there is more than one type of .50 receiver and one is nearly on par with a hardened .308 is a fact and makes it a bit more significant.  It is still silly the .50 is not much more powerful than a .308, but it is what it is.
---
No prob, it was only about two hours ago so not many have seen it
---
Same deal here. Usually on after 8ET 
---
Tmsales5

&gt;I troll soyboy millennials

---
ooh you sly old dog you
---
Trying to enter one of them gives the message that only Vault Tec employees can enter. Since there are no ways to become an employee, yet, it stands to reason that it's future content.
---
I am against duping, but I just want to point out that the moral expectations of real life can’t be applied to in game behavior. Especially one designed to be a post apocalyptic universe where players are encouraged to both work together and pvp. Should I be banned if I kill you and take all of your screws? (Screws being stolen property)
---
There are exactly 5 of those and I know where they all are.
---
There is an Acid/Lead one, a Junk/Lead one, a Gold/Copper one, a Acid/Fertilizer one and a Steel/Copper one.
---
Those are the only 5 that exist, I've checked all across the map.
---
Besides the Flatwoods monster, no
---
I think I got my All Rise sledge from a quest.  It’s not fantastic, but 90% reduced weight makes a good backup when ballistic weapons aren’t helping me. 
---
Lewisburg in the ash heap is good. Make sure to hit uncanny valley and the big bend tunnel. Also visit there before nuking it. Depending what enemies are in Lewisburg determines what spawns in the blast zone. If it's ghouls you're good. 
---
I nuked Dyer chemical the other day. Not bad but the plants are near nonexistent. 
---
Honestly just use power armor, fusion cores are common and the protection can’t be beat
---
Dude, you don't make shit off of Nuka Cola. There is no way in hell you find more than 20 bottles a day if you play at least 2 hours a day. 20 caps is literally nothing. 
---
The damaged bottle caps could be used for Bottle cap mines.
---
It is seriously unimportant.
---
But, I digress, as a better work around is to reward up to 25 caps each real time day from Nuka Cola sources, that way you get your precious caps. We can make it 35 if you are the Nuka Cola hound you claim to be, but I highly doubt you get more than that.
---
Same here. 
---
Purified water is also great as selling goods to robot vendors.
---
So happy that someone joins in with the melee thing, when you run assassins and the perk blocker you already win against a melee guy. funny that people call a melee build op when there is a shotgun thats having full damage on sniper range. Just ridiculus. 
---
Yes i think every legendary perk needs a nerf, and that detonation needs to be only missile and grenades.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Its pretty cheap to say nerf that and nerf that if you didn't try to reduce the damage of others and jst go for damage stuff.
---
Hey so how did you come across it I'm on ps4
---
You may want to try using critical savvy instead of four leaf clover. With 15 luck and critical savvy it should only take 2-3 hits to refill your critmeter. And once you activate a critburst, all the hits you get in that burst also count towards refilling your critmeter. This should allow you to keep firing off crits forever (untill you run out of AP or you kill something too quickly).
---
This would also allow you to use your TS weapons once again, since their shitty accuracy doesn't come into play if you're only using VATS crits anyway. 
---
Unfortunately this "crits-only" play style breaks when you get a gun thats too powerful, as you NEED to get those 2 or 3 hits in on every target to keep the chain going. If everything dies within 1 or 2 hits, you'll keep ending up with a 85% critmeter that you can't activate and then you're back to using a shitty inaccurate TS gun in VATS untill you finally hit something again. (RIP TS + 50% VATS Crit handmade)
---
It’s also the shortest vendor from fast travel I think. 
---
Then we would be a scorched or super mutant.
---
You have to go to your game options to turn it on. It prevents you from dealing damage to other players, even with explosives (barring cars and other environmental explosions).
---
Literally all they have to do is raise the level for wepons to like 75 for the next content drop ,and add more mods/ plans that are better then the last and everything will basically be fixed. If your worries about everyone having infinite items for mods we can just add new junk to the mix for the new mods.
---
I haven't really bothered with the "power up X" quests, so I only have 2 generator plans and neither are the Fusion... but I also like building mansions in remote places, so the power stations are not an option for me lol
---
If you are high enough level to have the plans and mats for the fusion reactor sure.
---
Probably the biggest problem is that Bethesda is used to their players identifying and fixing problems in their games for them. Somehow they didn’t realize that this wouldn’t work for an online multiplayer game; maybe this is why they’ve resisted it for so long. 
---
Dude...yes...
---
You completed the main quest line.
---
There's also the raider questline and the brotherhood questline. And the order of mysteries. And the responders if you haven't finished that.
---
Bethesda has confirmed that more quests are coming. 
---
Oh, shoot. I didn't read your previous comment right. I thought you were getting onto him for y'all, not "ya'll".
---
&gt; The dupers already have the big bucks... some in the millions...
---
With a caps cap of 25k per character, that's a lot of micromanaging they have to do there. 
---
From the informations i gathered, responders vendor bots can sell it, but it’s always random what they have in store. So the idea would be to find one check what it has in stock, and hop servers if the plan you look for isn’t available 
---
While I understand that, if nothing is done about it then when you open that nuka cola you may get a cap, but it's a zimbabwe cap that 1 billion of is worth what one pre-crisis cap is worth.
---
Nothing short of a hard reset at this point. Wipe everyone and make everyone start over.
---
Two shot explosive. 
---
Its the highest damage legendary effect combination. 
---
This made me laugh way harder than it should have. Good luck finding your pet Hitman 
---
Funny thing is, that was my second one. I server hopped for a couple hours for the first one at Watoga when I was lvl 18. So I gave it to my buddy.
---
is this a console thing, or had you friended them? 
---
Also there IS a "last audio log" from the overseer which I think I found at the entrance to the silo I launched from. 
---
These inside the vault entries are so vague they border on useless. These newsletters need a bit more meat on then to serve as community engagement items. 
---
Try visiting a different server, or come back to a quest location in 15-30 minutes
---
Happy cake day! 
---
What? Alot of people work during the holidays. All my other games are still receiving updates, communication, support, and even events. This bug is an embarrassment.
---
Level up and become stronger?  I know this sounds like an asshole response but this is literally what everyone playing the game has to do.  
---
Just to be clear: Duping is cheating. Knowingly exploiting is cheating, if you buy from duper, you're cheating, etc.
---
I'm sure several have trading for duped items unknowingly, but seriously, I concur, ban/delete duped items and those producing them. I too would like to set up shop once player vendors are a thing and no player crafted items will stand up to a market flooded with duped legendaries
---
Wait forBethesda to fix it. Its a known issue. 
---
It doesn't effect me personally, but that is completely irrelevant. I have seen people try and buy complete sets of magazines and always see people trying to buy ammo on the various foruns/the groups I follow on PS4.
---
But thanks for stopping by
---
I know of a dozen people I've met in the discord each of whom have stashes like this with well over 1 million nuka cola bottles. https://i.imgur.com/kcaO2SM.jpg that dude has LITERALLY a million nuka colas in his aid tab.
---
Any perks that don't have a definite bonus to battle should be free.
---
Hmm, how about weapon durability ones? 
---
I'm level 13 and have yet to meet one of these players.  I usually wave and everyone goes about their business.   Best I've gotten is a level 50 left a random sack of his unwanted junk in his shack at the golf course.  
---
I've done all the faction quests for the main quest. I didnt bother with order of mysteries because it's a side thing and I wanted to see the main quest because I had so many questions about the scorched and ultracite and the enclave and stuff. Guess not :/
---
Assuming they can remove dupers there's still the items they have sold to deal with, particularly TSE. The explosive effect needs a serious balance pass and Demolition Expert should only effect grenades, mines, and launchers.
---
Are you a general in the enclave?
---
p.s. i am trolling you
---
Here’s why 
---
https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1080188836993515521
---
If, hut my point is that it just surfaces more possible surfaces for unwitting players to end up with duped weapons. 
---
I'd also actually point our that you'd be hard pressed to sell many copies of a more expensive legendary to one vendor given the infuriating 200 cap ceiling. 
---
What area are you in?
---
I dont wanna be bend.
---
Speaking of which.....I wonder if we will ever see a scorched super mutant...
---
Vendor limits aren't shared between players. They're reset daily and some vendors share caps.  You can get 12-1400 caps/day If you hit every group.
---
There are circumstances where you might not, sure, but a blanket "nobody could know" is nonsense.  And there seem to be a decent number of dupers who don't care if the people they're trading with know.
---
Regardless, making people suspicious of trading with randos as long as duping exploits are a thing is good.  It undermines the demand for duped items, which in turn makes duping less appealing.
---
Oh wow 4 years yay!
---
He's either jetpacking or using vats a ton. I sprint around with only Batteries included and barely use a core every 3 hours.
---
Well, as far as I'm concerned, muling is just a way for players to bypass intentional limits set and is almost cheating. They should increase the stache limit and definitely add a maximum carry weight
---
The middle ground between armor and Power Armor is the Marine Armor.
---
Well, I honestly think they shouldn't have been linked to crafting perks. They should be active and have cost (imo), and shouldn't have anything to do with crafting weapons. That was a weird design choice, especially because it doesn't work that way with armor 🤦
---
So that's why my patient died..
---
I know I need stmpacks all the time!
---
Get Pharma Farmer, check every bathroom, even residential ones, there's usually a first aid box on the wall or a mirror. If you don't find stimpacks  you'll get drugs you can sell to vendors  You get a lot through defending workshops although depending on the level of enemies you might end up using some. There's a hospital in Charleston I seem to remember quite a few there. Dilute them to make the go further.
---
The recipe is available from the Enclave at Whitesprings bunker, about 200 caps or thereabouts. Keep hold of tick blood for crafting them. 
---
The lay out in game is slightly different it seems, they shrink everything to fit in the map.
---
Choose install and make it install same directory as the game already is installed.
---
I have to go to wendigo cave
---
That said, some people don't have a choice on when to re- [DISCONNECTED FROM SERVER]
---
Only during the quest for rosie.
---
I wasn’t aware of that. I had thought they were for some odd reason shared because vendors I had never been to had no caps. I also didn’t know certain vendors shared caps 
---
Thatll come in super handy during a SB Queen fight when youre doing less damage then everyone else, running around yelling about beer.
---
I duped my power armor
---
Yes. Delete everyone’s progress and the entire game. Make everyone start over if you have to. This whole duped shit has run this game into the ground. 
---
Dude, killing those sentry bots are the best way to get fusion cores lol
---
During the first week I had a small group following me and using automatic weapons so that the slap damage built up enough to actually be wearing my health down quickly. Some people seem to put a lot of effort into being slightly annoying. 
---
Thanks good to see they at least know 
---
"Aaah yes! I can see your future now, all you need to do is..."
---
You are disconnected from the game.
---
Its fun imo, so yes.
---
I've had 7.....
---
I agree with that.
---
[removed]
---
&gt;incorporating the bridges into my build design was so much fun.
---
Agreed, I loved building my little brick water plant around the bridge support! I like that it almost looks like it could just be a pre-existing, pre-war building, unlike some camps which look obviously like shacks plopped down in the middle of nowhere. And a further added benefit is that there’s an Enclave event that spawns in Harper’s Ferry fairly regularly, which has been my main source of commendations so far!
---
Clearly no, because killing someone and looting their screws is an intended game mechanic. 
---
Duping is an exploit.
---
uhh what? I hate to tell you that getting rid of the people advertising bugs doesnt fix the problem, it just makes the bugs more exploitable for the few people who know them. blame bethesda for not fixing them not youtubers for making sure everyone knows about them. FOH
---
this is the cutest post, have fun
---
Thanks. TSE + CH? (consecutive hits {increases damage per each consecutive hits}) wouldn't that be better?
---
And there are laws in place for companys that try and break the law.... Hence we should be punitive towards cheaters lmao
---
I just might do that, this is the first CAMP I’m really proud of. My friend hates the sound of the windmills, but I think it adds to the ambiance.
---
Flint needs you 
---
Ah, see I run crit perks and using VATS just annihilates my cores. I wish I had better legendary armor so I could skip PA for most encounters
---
report him
---
I like posts like this over just radio silence.
---
Even though it doesn't say ALL that much, it does say a little and it at least lets us know that they still have a pulse.
---
I'm pretty sure fev effects make the host immune to further diseases and virises and such
---
deoends what gun but it still tech less than tse plus a tse can hit multiple enemies at once and they are killers in pvp
---
Do the “come over here” emotion, then crouch up and down on top of the bag. If that doesn’t work, shoot a gun at the bag a few times and throw a thumbs up in. If they don’t get it after that, you can always just pick it up and sell the water for 3 caps a pop at a vendor. It’s not a lot, but if you constantly have extra water it adds up.
---
That would be interesting to say in the least
---
Because he's a Yao Guai
---
Hey I know this is unrelated but how is the power for it 420 damage? Is that cause of your build? If so what is your build that makes that so high?
---
More pie in the sky bs.  What will be coming are likely more game breaking bugs.
---
I agree duping is an exploit and it’s bad, but trading is also an intended game mechanic. 
---
I’m just saying that someone buying a duped item is different than someone duping and IMO shouldn’t result in a ban. To be clear I think duping should be bannable, but I also don’t think it is going to happen
---
Sorry autocorrect 
---
Oh damn.  I have Bird Bones :(
---
Get stimpacked!
---
The fo4 settlement mechanics made up for some of that. But fo76 feels utterly stripped of anything /everything. The world is otherwise beautiful but the game feels so hollow.
---
Wait, Ordinance Express effects mini nukes and missiles? I thought it only effects grenades and mines. 
---
hahaha...Global chat, it's so cute that you think there is such a thing on the PC-side.
---
Growing the game in 2019....good joke 
---
You get 1 random plan each time you power up a plant if you're lucky you get the fusion generators first it provides 100 power.
---
So many? How many? Ive read reddit thread about people who wrote 4 paragraphs about giving some noob purified water. But never seen anyone attempting to rp in game. Maybe its an xbox thing.
---
If you're willing, i'd suggest checking out the trading subreddits.  Don't get lowballed - especially if you're on PC, where prices avg a bit higher than console for some reason.  There are people who are looking for specifically energy weapons with explosive and other good perks on them that may pay roughly 1-3k caps or trade similar for that.  Don't be afraid to trade to get what you want, I've never been ripped off.
---
Global chat doesnt exist on PC.
---
Ill probs get downvoted for speaking my mind but Im just not experiencing what you are to the extent that I will go to a public forum to vent.
---
The only event I couldnt do by myself was "feed the people" because I was too low level and the bots Im sure infinitely respawn. And even then it was because I ran out of stims, then food, then water (so I couldnt replenish my health) while looking for the damn food canisters.
---
Now when I return if I do, those bots get annihilated by my experience, gear, and perks.
---
It taught me a valuable lesson that I shouldnt bite more than I can chew. And if I do get very hungry I damn sure will be packing a ton of stims/chems/grenades/etc.
---
take it slow? like idk what to tell you it aint a race
---
are these disconnects from consoles only?
---
i've got 70 hours and only had 1 disconnect.
---
The "PvP suffers" part made me chuckle.
---
I don't think anyone should be banned. I don't really care about "punishing" people. I think all of the duped items should be deleted or otherwise neutered.
---
Its random what plan you get each time
---
Because capitalism
---
Agreed. Bought a lever that isn't as absurd as a TSE but for all I know it is duped. At the same time, I've found a two shot fifty cal, bloodied explosive laser, and two shot mini nuke launcher that can handle anything fairly easily. By lever is for a niche VATs build anyways
---
&gt;And I don't mean adding the anti-scorched effect to a 3 star weapon.
---
You become immune to scorched during the story.
---
There is a sucker born every minute still holds true sadly.
---
Only way to fix it is to either do a full reset of everyone, which I condone both because it would bring the magic of the first few weeks back, the game was released too early, and I expect most FO players are use to resetting. Plus it would deal with the lag caused by ppl with near infinite stashed and inventory 
---
.... you good, bruh?
---
true, I personally think its too late to do much about the duped items now other then to nerf the most duped items, or possibly creat an identical item to replace the items that are most likely duped, so instead of having a 2shot explosive shotgun you now have a bubble gun worth 0 caps and does no damage, but a new item now exists in the game that is a 2shot explosive shotgun.  
---
it would be a real kick in the teeth for people who legit got them, but some sacrifices would have to be made for the greater good
---
Since there is no endgame,people just want to farm the best gear possible,and you can acquiere these by buying them from other players
---
Nope its random, I got the fusion first time.

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) if you have any questions or concerns.*
---
I wonder if you'll be able to destroy a players vending machine along with their camp.
---
Wendigo cave was probably the highest difficulty point for me in solo play. Even if you dont normally use them I would recommend bringing grenades and mines, along with a large amount of stimpaks. 
---
If you are looking to level up you could explore the various towns of the forest, toxic valley, or Ash Heap and pick up side quests to level up some. It wont be terribly required for the following area of the main quest, but you will definitely want to bulk up before nearing the final area. 
---
I'm glad this caught traction now. I wish [someone brought it up sooner](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aber4o/so_i_guess_nobodys_going_to_be_doing_scorched/) so Bethesda could've gotten a head start on fixing it.
---
Judging by this post, they definitely won.
---
I have a TSE that I bought from a played and I wouldn’t mind if I lost it as long as all other copies were gone too. 
---
Why?
---
Would be nice if they added Tumbling Tumbleweeds and Swinging on a Star back.  Still no idea why they were removed on 11/19.
---
Yup. I was going to offer them some of my nice food stuffs. Now they will just have to live off of duped dog food
---
Disagreed. I for one don't want to play with cheaters who are actively harming the game as well as causing great server instability which is negatively impacting thousands of player's experiences. 
---
The only way to fix the game is to remove all duped weapons. If you paid thousands that's a shame but if you keep it you're keeping the game broken. I'd love a powerful weapon but I will not buy one until duping is fixed because I know I'd never trust it to be honest. Honestly it is a tough shit kick in the nuts but to allow anyone who has one to keep it is to keep the game broken and the economy dead. 
---
tbh i want the cannibal perk to turn me into a wendigo
---
pretty sure they are fixing the no clip bug in bunkers so i cant launch 12 nukes in 2hrs witj my team sry guys
---
I agree duper’s should be banned. However, banning someone who bought a duped item unknowingly is just plain stupid. 
---
Some people have truly disposable income.   
---
Stay in school, kids.
---
It's worse when a player enters your play zone and respawns all the enemies you just spent ages killing. It's really annoying and it's bad game design.
---
My turrets do an excellent job of defending my crops from the fence I built 
---
There's no global chat on PC? Lmao wow
---
Yeah me too. Cant join a server.
---
You need to train your sloth or we'll have to put it down.
---
Yup I don't have two shot, instigating, explosive combat shotguns. What I don't get is I drained the main dudes bar to zero but he wouldn't die 
---
Level 225, main ranged weapon is a pipe rifle.  It's TSE but I used one before as well.  Cheap to maintain, and with proper perk setup I tune mine up over 2k per shot.
---
That's a common one from Customer service u/papa_shekels in a game like this, or just CS in general. I would be willing to bet my entire savings that they can manipulate stuff on a client level. But can you imagine how many cases they would have to deal with if they opened those doors? "HURR DURR my (insert item) disappeared, this game is trash HALP"  and the mountains of work it would take for them to sort through and manage that just to find the legitimate cases with a team that obviously wasn't staffed enough to handle that amount of work.   
---
They are likely just going to end up banning a swathe of the turd dupers, nerf explosive weapons, and then raise the item cap so the duped items aren't best anymore.
---
I just don't understand why yall need some many water purifiers? I just have my one small purifier, have speed demon and still give away water like theres no tomorrow. 
---
Chameleon armor + glassed caverns?
---
What?
---
I have, but it's only going to do so much good. I can tell you around black Friday he sold a lot of gear, and bought a handful of copies of the game so it's probably even worse now.
---
If you kill a flatwoods monster it will count as both flatwoods monster and alien for this challenge, I just completed it yesterday.
---
People who are duping are stupid enough to dupe 40,000 nuka quantums, 1,500 X-01 jetpacks and a bunch of deadly shotguns and shit like that.
---
Their inventory will be PACKED full of rare/leveled items, so just do a quick looksie, and if they're dumb enough to mass dupe, then ban hammer cometh.
---
Yeah got kicked now can't connect at all.
---
If they destroyed it don’t waste resources on placing new objects but use your camp to “REAPIR BROKEN ITEMS” or whatever
---
proof? because in my personal experience it's exactly as I described.
---
Exactly! I’ve just finished dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s on my ideal base there and I couldn’t be happier with it. I’ve actually had random people in servers come up and compliment me on it, which gives me all the warm fuzzy feelings haha. I don’t think I’ll be moving for a very long time, although the one thing I wish it had was one of those gorgeous mountain-top views. Can’t have it all I guess.
---
pretty sure it's a bundle.
---
I load in. Enter AVR Medical Center.  
---
When leaving, it hangs at loading. Waited 10 min earlier. Quit and restarted. Same steps, same issue. Stuck at loading again. Just trying to complete this effing quest step and it never seems to save that it was completed (analyze blood samples).  
---
Xbox here.
---
My thoughts are not fully developed in this off-a-whim reddit post.
---
You are right. In fact, I'll make a quick edit.
---
As most have pointed out, the items themselves probably can't all be deleted/shouldn't mecessarily be deleted and that is fine. But I still want the dupers to be punished in some way
---
Interestingly just like in F4 there are times when TSE are a hindrance then a blessing. Somewhat rare but it happens. Thats why I carry a two shot furious 15% reload speed with a prime auto reciever for certain things.
---
Pvp is good in some ways with TSE, especially when you both have em. Its op when you have it and the other player doesnt, however there are ways around them. You will have to grind/farm alot though for the specific armor.
---
You're kidding me. 
---
There is a big difference between what customer support can do and what the devs themselves can do. Just because support says they can’t doesn’t mean the devs can’t. They are completely separate entities 
---
I agree that would fix things moving forward. However, with no disciplinary action, the guys with multiple accounts/characters and maxed 25k caps won’t care won’t bit. They already got theirs. 
---
Have had a few super-high level people trash my base or attack me.  
---
I just quit and server hop.  
---
Solved.
---
Didn't make that clear, sorry, not supporting the ban of duper's customers, because at least of few if them didn't know they were buying duped items.
---
But if you are knowingly buying duped items, you're a damned dirty cheater, just like the duper.
---
Probably something that could get them banned, both players
---
That's the plan. I just need to gather steel and wood. I just used up all my steel making ammo.
---
You can only get certain trait combos, there are primary and tertiary traits.  Best combo IMO for TSE in terms of benefit and trade value are weight redux/reload speed.
---
People should find a new game if they’re not happy with playing the game the way it’s meant to be played without looks for glitches and fucking cheating. 
---
Your either spending time to save money, or spending money to save time. 
---
Agreed 
---
I'm only level 30, so that's probably part of the issue, but there should be some sort of queue you can join if you're a lower level player looking to do them. I've been able to do a few by myself but there's a lot that require more than one person in my opinion, such as the corpse flower defense event. There's like 6, and they're spaced far enough apart that you have to sprint to each one to get eyes on it, and then the other 4 you can't see are getting attacked. Makes no sense. 
---
New currency like xur from destiny. A new currency could be introduced to buy good 3 start legendarys from a weekly trader.
---
What have we done. Maybe they were never meant to be opened...sealed not to keep us out...but to keep them in...
---
They are selling Caps online, and the 25k limit is per character, they can store it on other characters. Just go to any youtube like DemonAsylum. Right when you go into the video the first thing they show is an ad for cap sales lol.
---
It's really not bad with SD and ammo perks, and you'll use less rounds to do the same job.  Give it a whirl.
---
That extra mod wouldnt be possible since theyre both primary ones, either two shot or consecutive
---
High int is necessary for almost any power armor users though sadly 
---
But boiled water has that extra flavor from boiled  radiated feces.  You just lose that distinct taste of its purified.
---
Because they're poor in real life and being rich in fantasy land makes it better
---
Sadly I don’t have chameleon armor yet. I try to stay low-medium level areas to get the most traffic.
---
This game really is full of cocksuckers and douchebags. 
---
nah they arew fixing the no clib bugs in bunkers nobody cares about the pictures thing 
---
It's only more amusing that this was found because of a glitch and not someone hacking or using exploits.
---
Good thing you're not in charge of the game as doing this would generate so much bad faith it would be a miracle if they ever recovered.
---
Muling isn't remotely close to cheating.  Its using legitimate in game mechanics to offload excess but useful items.  This is a strategy I've used in several  online rpg's and I don't know of a single instance where the game company tried to prevent it or patch it out.  It would be suicidal.
---
Super duper perk makes food and water a non issue I find.
---
Water - pop radix, stand in stream and collect dirty water.
---
Equip super duper perk, “craft boiled water”.
---
Admittedly I usually just use purified water as I have water purifiers and seem to find a fair bit (and have so much adhesive I don’t need to craft vegetable starch.
---
Food - kill wildlife, equip butchers bounty perk, cook with super duper.
---
Better yet get carnivore mutation and just eat raw and spoiled meat
---
I'm aware of their code of conduct.
---
Lots of companies have something similar in their TOS. 
---
&gt;ZeniMax, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to take such action as appropriate in the event of any violation, including immediate termination of Your Account, and/or banning You from playing the Game, and/or using any ZeniMax Services.
---
It doesn't say they **will** ban you. It says they reserve the right to take action, which could involve banning. Since neither Bethesda nor the players can even tell which objects are duped, they can't fault people for this. They'd be a shitty company if they even tried to. It's their mistake to fix. 
---
And did you see this?
---
&gt;You will not directly or indirectly communicate the existence of any such bug to any other user of the ZeniMax Service (in game or on a ZeniMax service).
---
According to that, /u/CaptainPryk and everyone else who posts about the exploits on reddit should be punished as well. 
---
Goto low level areas and farm xp.
---
Like others have said Wendigo cave is a dangerous place.
---
In fact I would treat all wendigos with respect. I.e. in a crowd of ghouls they die first.
---
Why would support recover an item you've duped?
---
Fix duping exploit and then create a second server with a fresh start. People who would burn their discs can stay on the original dupe-filled server, and those who want to have a fresh start can do so. Simple.
---
Providing information isn’t a ban able offense.
---
Hundred Duplicated Weapons is a huge understatement.

Player vendor is going to be a thing?

tbh the inly off put i seen is you cant shoot tse to close to you since they are almost insta deaths theres ways to counter it with mutations
---
Some of the best stories in fallout are the ones without a quest. Are the ones we discover 
---
Are you trying to outlive your bounty, or trying to show new places to people?
---
Why not roads?
---
Moooooney.. we really don’t need it! We’ll make out alright. Juiiiicebox Saturday night! 🎶🎶
---
I loled and upvoted ya hahhahahah
---
Going forward new players coming into the game need to be able to compete with veterans. Having a set of players equipped with items that newer players would find very difficult to aquire would be seriously imbalancing.
---
 This could partially be done by raising item levels and adding more special points, but a player with a TSE basically already has more special points than someone else, since they basically allow you to deal massive damage without any specific perk cards. 
---
New item levels would need to be significantly higher too. I have a level 15 explosive shotty sitting in my stash that unperked and unmodded does more damage than my fully perked and modded crafted level 45 handmade rifle.
---
Do you only lose junk when killed by another player? I only got the game the other day and don't know much about the pvp side of it. I'm currently wanted for damaging a owned workbench and not sure if I should keep playing with my good weapons and armour until I'm killed or stash everything first.
---
don't have windmill or large yet, but already built a fusion and one for a friend also. 
---
Ban all the dupers and introduce a new gear level that makes all the duped items obsolete.
---
Happened today, lost some good loot. Oh well, just have to go hunt more mole miners! 
---
Nobody is gonna pick up 1000 frags and then say "huh, seems legit."
---
If they're dropping 1000 frags because they got carried away duplicating shit to be a cap-monger or something, maybe they need to PLAY THE GAME, instead of trying to break it for everyone else?
---
Not to worry, once these fools get to lvl150 and are bored because every mob is basically exploding at the mere sight of em, they'll piss off and the game will stabilize?
---
Honestly this is only my second bad experience. Overall the community has been great. Sadly I use a pistol build and good legendary pistol drops are super rare.
---
I’ve never had and item removed due to bug or glitch, so I don’t have a reason to email them.
---
But that’s irrelevant. If Bethesda has officially stated this, and the above users are acting like it’s common knowledge, there should be some easily available proof.
---
How much lisp should I be adding to the internal monologue that I read your messages in? For the sake of accuracy.
---
I really feel sorry for her if you actually say stupid things like this
---
PC
---
Power counters do not appear to work properly - no matter the setting, they simply act as a power pylon with a number wheel on it, instead of the way they worked in fallout 4 - transmitting power only after the programmed count is reached.
---
Also - on the off chance someone in bethesda actually reads this - give us more power related workshop items!!! Would love to see some returning items from contraptions dlc, like logic gates - and also something to facilitate basic power clock functionality would be amazing!
---
Because why would you build in the middle of a road. Would you do that in real life which blocks traffic?
---
easily as bad is getting DC after travelling to an event you can handle just fine.  waste of time and caps.
---
Well you’re lucky then. I’ve had more bad experiences because of douchebags ruining my game playing experience than good ones. 
---
If there's one or two items on the ground, you can't really tell and it doesn't matter anyway.
---
If there's 1500 on the ground and it's not ammo, there's a good chance it's duped.
---
Apparently they can't track items like that anyway.
---
make sure you grab all the plastic pumpkins, golf balls etc. I got over 150 plastic last run through morgantown. 
---
It was in Skyrim so ypu couldn't just vackpedal out of every fight anymore, so I imagine.
---
*just... one more... stimpak*
---
lol, avoiding perk cards that buff your rifle isnt a great method to make a rifle build. Never used escape artist, but it is only 1 star iirc, but the enemies in this game are tarded and your base sneak is high enough on its own. You wont need the sneak perk cards unless youre going to melee sneak.
---
Get a lvl 1 for all 3 rifle damage buff cards, long shot x3, tank killer x3, gunsmith x5, bloody mess x3, covert ops x 1, Adrenaline x1
---
Didn't know about the fissure sites being closed. That's...interesting. 
---
There is no balance, if you find a weapon with 2shot and explosive, it's an instant kill even if you miss because of the massive aoe. High level pvp is nothing but instakill and grenades from cover
---
Pvp was bascially stillborn on launch anyway outside of griefing. Even without duping, the existence of TSE weapons breaks meaningful pvp.
---
Valid point. I guess ultimately it comes down to the fact that Bethesda should’ve made sure this game was sealed right and ready - because in my honest opinion there really is no ‘clear’ way to fix this. The whole thing is just f*cked now, you know? 
---
excellent close range skirmish weap!
---
   
---
Maybe they will advance something of a possible patch, in which we can put an end to the threat of the scorched. and we focus on other problems 
---
Some are doing it because they just hate grinding and just want to be a god and run around the game. I know people that the first time they get in a game they look for the god mode cheat and set it to very easy. There is actually a huge market for it. 
---
They are selling the caps online too. Just go to any of the youtubers that keep mass spreading these dupes. They are advertising cap sales. Strangely enough they are killing their own business too which is kind of strange but you won't catch me arguing with them.
---
Yeah, junk and caps at most. And a bit of dignity in some cases.
---
Roughly 0%   
---
Hoorah "marine"
---
Why is everyone getting so upset about pvp? Dying in this games does nothing except reduce your rads and give u a full heal.  I guess if you haven't stored your junk for awhile you might have alot in your inventory but an inventory's worth of junk takes like 3  min to get. 
---
&gt;the game economy is a joke.
---
Absolutely and the bazaar is an excellent example. A sub for trading but is almost exclusively over powered end game items. When I first saw that sub I was stoked on the idea of it being something of a trading hub for people wanting to be traders selling their wares. Instead if you go in there offering anything less than a 3 star legendary you're called out for selling "trash", and ridiculed if you can't pay the absurd prices. 
---
I'm excited to see what improvements come this year but looking forward to 2020 is cool too I guess.
---
I'm sorry.
---
The game doesn't need an elitist attitude, man. Not everyone has to be dealing 1k damage every hit
---
BoS heavy combat.

Well if you're on PC hit me up. Let's change that for you.

Aluminum screws? Aluminum is way too soft, and fabricating aluminum fasteners that are hard enough to fasten could simply be replaced with cheaper, more accessible stainless steel screws/galvanized screws. Even if you had the screws in a given object, good luck not stripping the hell out of them when you're extracting.
---
They posted a twitter update saying that theyre aware of the problem, meaning its not intended and a glitch, unfortunately.
---
Nope. 
---
but it also makes trading incredibly hard on a decent scale. noones going to want to run around trading all the time if there isnt some sort of hub for it. Sure you'll get some trades here and there but I cant see any true traders economy happening without a GE or hub of sorts.

In Xbox It isnt

The red fire fighter helmet is at The Whitespring in the middle shop.

Yeah, so you were just abandoned when you overslept.

They all hated you.

Neither. I just wanted to have a little fun watching people hunt me down. 
---
Well shit. Even less reason for me to bother, since I don't really already.
---
I was having this issue, also on Xbox. I dropped all notes and holos from my character and stash and it seemed to somewhat help the situation. It would crash almost every time I was taking anything from my stash and now it’s more like 1 out of 10 times.
---
Sapper actually, but i wouldnt expect a grunt to understand
---
Awesome never knew about it thanks guys 
---
Yeah, spend days/weeks grinding for a TSE weapon or drop a dollar for one. Some people just can't be arsed grinding.
---
Sup, dude...
---
I know I am a little bit too late to the conversation, but where the hell can I find the terminal at all?
---
Level up
---
Thanks for that info. I’ll be sure to check out the event if I see it. You have any idea what it’s called?
---
That's the game within the game, those clever BGS devs!!  Try to see what you can get done between crashes/discons.  Clever strat win win win.
---
Im hoping they add some clutter type items. Like those mods from 4 to help your house look more lived in
---
At this point, any type of punishment for duping is pointless. It will only hurt the small player base that is currently left and it's definitely Bethesda's fault for letting duping go on for so damn long without really addressing it that much and definitely not saying they will punish for doing it.  The only thing they can do is make current items obsolete but that doesnt fix all the materials and consumables that were duped.
---
That’s a great idea I’ll have to farm some legendaries up!
---
that would mean admitting they released the game with no economy. 
---
I wish. PS4. 
---
Today I was trying to empty out my inventory. Take some weapons out and put 2 away. Game crashes. Reload game and get back in world. Put 1 weapon away crash. Reload put the last one away then ran as far away from my stash box as I could before crashing again
---
It'd be nice not to have to pay for them too.
---
Any players with more than 100,000 caps = instant ban hammer.
---
If you have that many caps in inventory, and you're not something like lvl 250,  is a HUGE red flag.
---
That's more caps than could ever be on a servers economy anyway, *they're never up long enough to refresh the traders caps anyway.*
---
Yes, we MIGHT lose maybe 50 legit players WORLDWIDE, but^ it's^ a^ sacrifice^ I'm^ willing^ to^ make.^
---
&gt;Good thing you're not in charge of the game as doing this would generate so much bad faith it would be a miracle if they ever recovered.
---
I think the people that are actually in charge of the game are already well in their way to generating enough bad daughter to completely kill the game.
---
They shouldn’t be banned, but have their carry weight reduced to 0 and for every duped item they drop they get a little bit of their carry weight back.
---
All water bodies are pitch black. I tried the " bUseWaterHiRes=0 " ini edit to no avail.

I barley played DS3, but I didn't know that players could exchange items at all
---
I had a couple people following me the other day with only one ever shooting at me--basically so his friend could one-shot me and they can loot my junk. I didn't fire back and choose to run around Whitesprings for about 15 minutes hoping they'd hit a robot with a stray bullet. When I got bored of this, I hoped into my power armor and used my jetpack to get on top of the buildings. I waved at them while they slinked away.
---
Bethesda please stop being authoritarians and banning people 
---
Diet Double Dew 
---
That would be super nice. Can’t see them just letting us have that free option anymore though. 
---
But it has free shipping!
---
Sorry to hear that. It’s so frustrating.
---
- People who sell digital money for IRL dosh?
---
- People who pay real money to save weeks of grinding?
---
- People who grind endlessly at Whitesprings for weeks?
---
&gt;The whole thing is just f*cked now, you know? 
---
It really is.
---
We'll yes, it could be that they never played any multi-player games ever in their lives and that no-one would ever cheat on an online game. Sure. They just unsurprisingly half assed the game. Or rather 1/100-assed it.
---
Any word on when they will have fixed.
---
The thing is F76 DOESN'T have an AC atleast not a decent one. And again Bethesda didn't ban just exclusively for cheat engine either. Again my point is that Bethesda simply doesn't have "blatant evidence" that these players were in fact cheating or not. And that's were the issue with these bans lie. Because they're bloody random out of the blue bans with little to go on as to "why". And the "essay" very much reflects that. And honestly if there's anything Bethesda should be cracking down on it's the dupers and exploiters running around(without even having to use any cheat engine etc.) But what Bethesda response to dupers? Block them and switch server. I mean seriously? Long story short these "bans" and the required essay are a joke and a bad one at that. But then again people told Bethesda that they would need protection for their online game way before launch when it first came to light that F76 is effectively unprotected. Yet literally nothing was done about it. 
---
I mean lets be real here there is little point to actually "cheat" in F76 in the first place outside of a god mode cause there's plenty of exploits running rampant in F76 that pretty much cover just about anything one would consider to cheat for. I mean even pvp makes no sense since explosive weapons pretty much nuke everything to high heavens with the right perks so even there is no reason to cheat either. 
---
It doesn't affect you personally, yet you're whining about it. 
---
Long shot is useless, it buffs scoped range not damage.
---
Ah ok that's not so bad, thanks for answering.
---
Yep - PC. 
---
He only ate 3 children he’s perfectly safe! 
---
From what I've seen thus far, the removal from radaways are completely random, the only way to pick and choose which mutations you have is by purchasing the serums
---
then refund me i have 100 hours played and dont want to level again, never signed up for that shit
---
You might have been on the same server as me - LOL those guys were fucking dicks. I don't know what kind of armor they are rocking but I have an explosive and couldn't get their health down fast enough. They were dressed like elves - suiting.
---
They literally do the duplication glitches, record and post it publicly.
---
This is illegal I think, or at the very least against TOS lol.
---
But to be fair, if you're someone that actually bought this, then you probably deserve to have your money taken from you...
---
Was one of them wearing a mascot head?
---
Nope
---
Yep, I was enjoying this glitch then I mutated again and got Bird Bones, broke the glitch.
---
Sorry what? what paint is this? and what do I need to murder to get my hands on it? 
---
Scales with flat HP lost.  So if you have more health you can get more of a bonus.
---
And the super duping fools will get bored of being OP merchant kings, and find another game to systematically ruin.
---
The wasteland WILL stabilize. We will rebuild!
---
thanks
---
&gt; Because they're poor in real life and selling those duped items makes them rich(er) IRL.
---
FTFY
---
How is it that a 600 lb. stache is a potential stability concern, and your 4000 lb. character inventory isn't???
---
And the scout mask is the only “mask” you cannot equip with a headwear. I felt so disappointed after I purchased that.
---
There's an anti-explosive paint for PA. At least, there was in 4 and the datamines say it's in 76.....
---
What about the people that have got 3 star TSE’s legitimately and are at white springs to farm for xp legitimately? I have 1 TSE weapon I got from doing just that. Not hating, just curious.
---
Yep, it's more fallout 4 but this time you play it with a friend if they are there.
---
You do the quests, you explore, you read the terminals.
---
Reading these "endgame is crap" posts is kinda surreal, because they appear to skip over the actual plot of the game that I'm still working through.
---
I personally dislike the lack of NPC interaction, and the effectively on-rails plot.  I think the Devs had this great idea that they went WAY WAY overboard with (no NPCs, maybe works for 2 towns/locations, but not a whole fucking game - I digress).
---
Still enjoying it, but I don't think I'm going to be farming the shit out of this game any more than I farmed the shit out of fallout 4... 
---
What about end game content? Raids? Dungeons? Something please 
---
: shocked:

All you need is the Aquaboy/girl perk card.

Posts like this are why I purposefully make my CAMP look shitty and slapped-together.  The asshole mentality that loves to destroy something beautiful, won't find any beauty in my CAMP.

Glad to see they’re moving on without you too.
---
I picked up the last key fragment and the mission beacon is now stuck over my head and it won’t complete that part. I can’t drop it either because it’s a quest item.
---
You have a limit as to how much you stash, your needs will change as you level. Don't horde.
---
That fn blows
---
Well shit, that’s not very reassuring 
---
Quit to main menu and log back in. Hopefully you'll be put in a server where the enemies weren't spawned at such a high level by a high level playing visiting.

Watoga and Whitesprings are good places to hide in if you have chameleon and marsupial/jetpack.

Aaronholt Homestead in the forest also has at least 8 cranberry plants (+ tatoes, razorgrain and corn)

They don't have to not finish a game mode to stay in early access.
---
I'm not sure why you think their category in the store has anything to do with the state of the game.
---
But I agree grandparent was a weird collection of statements.
---
it is a multi player game, they have to try to achieve balance.  It is really not all just about you.
---
What are you looking to do? 
---
you can drop stuff?
---
Genius
---
The number is letting you know how many regular ones you have, not how many it costs to revive. You cannot revive with diluted. Idk about super. 
---
I pretty much have all the pieces you are looking for. Add me on ps4! My username is r_castro33
---
I've had so many random players stop and check it out. It has a meant some great interaction. The only thing I need to stock up on to fix it is a bit of wood and steel. I think that's a small price to pay for all those positive interaction.
---
This happens due to high level players in the area. Either bring help (even someone else low leveled) or wait rill noone is around then fast travel to the resort.

The one and only buff it should give is making you [big](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094737/).

Can't revive with super either. I wish we could by holding down the button longer to rez with more hp.

Bane of my existence.

But if you have a bit of patience, run around avoiding as much damage as you can, shooting them (sparingly) and you'll kill them overtime.

I did this with sniper and shotgun but took 20 mins or so and was 27 or so in the area.

Poor Tommy Jones can role play a merchant regardless. Now if what you mean is he can’t compete it doesn’t matter if there are dupe items. He won’t complete only playing 8 hours a week.

I think this should be free anyways to help those out that have issues with distinguishing shades within a certain colour spectrum

Ahh Bethesda with their special sense of logic

Umm. I can make 100 boiled waters in 5 minutes. That includes gathering the wood.  
---
What if it's in preparation for the next dlc?
---
I know right now it's a bug, but what if this is what happens when they do?
---
I'd like to see some alternate radio stations, for different genres.  I think a blues station could work pretty well, for example.
---
That said, what I'd *really* love to see is some more mining/labor songs, to go along with Sixteen Tons.  Bring in some Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie, and that type of thing.
---
This is glorious! Didn't think I'd read the whole thing but once I started I couldn't stop. 👏🏽 
---
Lol these are the type of people who cheat in every game. They enjoy the act of cheating.

I have a crazy theory that some of them bought the game, hate it, and are duping to harm it

No one turned anything off lol

I always will &lt;3

Whats good about it? Havent seen it yet actually

Your welcome 👍

Tip for new players: if you're in the Ash Heap and hear rumbling it's nothing to worry about just region ambiance. If you hear rumbling anywhere else, *run,* it means you're close to a Fissure site and that means *Scorchbeasts.*

I'm lv 150 and fun pvp between geared up players doesn't exist, and duplicated items are so abundant that people are giving them away. Everyone and their lv2 alt has a 2shot explosive shotgun and all mutation syrums and max caps (which is only 25k wtf?). the dupers have broken this game
---
&gt; What exactly would I get if I have a large bounty on my head?
---
Same as if you have a small bounty on your head. Perhaps a bit more infamy.
---
&gt; Can I still obtain caps? 
---
Yes, but you lose em if someone claims your bounty. Plus 50% pvp damage debuff for 3 hours if you run out of caps to pay your bounty.
---
&gt; What can I do besides roleplaying? 
---
Bait people in a team to farm caps.
---
______
---
I prefer to pvp around workshops and prey off loot bags. The amount of people carrying bulk springs on their persons is too damn high. I've collected maybe 200 springs over the past week.
---
I'll look for you if you're still waiting for an angel of death in about an hour when my kid's asleep.  I'll even give you your bounty back...just respawn and initiate trade with me, and offer something worthless for 30 caps and I'll accept :)
---
So it makes the game balanced
---
IGN: Grushnak
---
I’ll be on in 2 hours if you are still looking for pvp
---
No kiddo, that's 90% of devs will ban for item duping.....cheesing a boss, doing easier than intended quests?   Item duping in an online game should be met with perma-bans...
---
If you crouch (sneak) in PA are you visible from afar?  
---
Yeah...sounds like a pretty unhealthy relationship, honestly.

You aren't the only one I assure you.

You are full of shit or have a disability if it takes you half a hour to harvest water and to boil it, come the fuck on this is some next lvl first world videogame problem.

Had the same thing happen last night but they were dressed up as sc dog beasts
---
130 damage 5 shot shotgun which gives +10 ap. with some mods could make it better aswell. Damage is just generally good I would say!
---
They do. I know of two that are almost always available when I log on and not that far out of my main farming area.
---
Have you done the North and Northwest parts of the map? There are dailies and events as well. You need to level up more.
---
why are all the missle silos set to 9999 years on the silo tape. Some one told me they turned the nuke feature off for some kind of "event" in whitespring.... which isn't going on.
---
What is the deal? Lots of gossip going around.. clearly.
---
Anything Bethesda wants is a bannable offense.
---
Immersive! 
---
that's the thing though, it's majorly not. a small fraction of the game is multiplayer-focused, most (and I mean 99%) of it is played solo.
---
so they're ruining my fun for no real reason.
---
No one goes near other people unless a nuke is dropped. Not with broken pvp, dodgy and TSEs. They designed the game so you stay alone or with your team and ignore other people. It wasnt what they wanted to make but thats what they made. Go figure.
---
Not dropping a nuke 😭
---
It always only costs one stim, that text is just a count of the stims in your inventory.
---
Ok thanks I do have a lot of holo taps
---
Nah you’re probably stolen valor. Marine Corps catchphrase is Oorah; Army’s is Hooah. Hoorah isn’t a thing- you’d know that if you were actually in the military. Next, you assume I’m a “grunt” because I’m a Marine. As if to suggest that you’re unaware of the various mos that exist within the Corps. Lastly, you seem to defend the soyculture here; and granted I realize the standards of character in the army are far beneath the Marine Corps, I just can’t picture a soldier- or any serviceman (especially those who have served in combat)- ever embracing millennial fru-fruism.
---
Better luck next time. Stick to trying to fool other civilians to make yourself feel better about not carrying your own weight 😉.
---
The flamers damage players as normal in the camp. Gives me hope for a trap base. I’d bet other traps work too.
---
How can you call it unhealthy when that’s how we both act? It’s just our personalities, it’s a big reason why we’re together. Wtf dude
---
Could it be dropped/traded?
---
Dr. Fujiyama amd Optimus Prime are to blame.  (See how many people get THAT reference) XD
---
After claiming then defending a few workshops I usually gain a level. You also get the rewards
---
Say what now?
---
What a load of bullshit.
---
90% of devs are gonna ban players for cheesing bosses and doing easy quests?
---
What the fuck are you on? 
---
They're wrong.
---
It's a bug. It's going to be fixed soon.
---
Someone just got it, ty though. 
---
Maybe they had issues with licensing? Idk I ain't Beth
---
I also have this problem but no work around for it. 
---
+karma
---
Yeah, they posted on their "Inside the Vault" or whatever it is called on their website listing a few of the things they will be working on. They most notably included player vending in that list
---
Order of Mysteries is pretty darned cool, I have to say. 
---
I'd like to hear from a developer how it's possible to identify duped items or people who are duping. 
---
So it is worse than I thought... they just broke it.
---
Mole rats and radrats....everywhere.
---
Buy the “laying out” photo mode pose, makes you lay down. Crouch to hide your name while in water and you will be appear to be just under the surface of the water.
---
Hah, thanks.
---
I'm too fresh in the game to understand if you are kidding me. I really don't get any sense from your answer.
---
Yeah I only run lvl 1 Slugger cards, not 3s, but you should drop 3 cards from strength and put in Incisor
---
In my mind, there should be a bazaar area and your vendor just automatically takes an open stall. One central place where the vendors of all players on server are located.
---
Yes, it was how I was able to build a decent handmade.
---
already answered, but thanks.
---
Okay, thank you
---
Hmm, never tried that.  But I'll probably just stick to the rivers and the lakes that I'm used to.
---
Turn off "push to talk" in game settings
---
Thanks
---
Love how you got downvoted by at least 2 dupers XD
---
The floating drop near Flatwoods has a bat, but no plans
---
Need ammo badly, I’m on Xbox though.
---
there is [a text chat mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151?tab=description) on PC that has developed one hell of a community
---
I tried it too, i used 20 stimpacks, and i still died :(
---
Twisted Muscles mutation makes you get cripples way way more often, so Adamantium Skeleton becomes necessary then
---
if you have an armor with the chameleon prefix, you can disappear from the map even when you're wanted as long as you stay crouched.
---
Agreed!  
---
Waiting for the silos not to open
---
My guess is that they won't really focus on player economy development things like vendors until duping is fixed.
---
They can't undo the duping that was done, but I imagine they may be able to develop detection for people who will dupe. Hopefully the new year will bring some banwaves.
---
My guess is that a few things will minimize the dupes that have already happened; newer content will introduce 4 and 5 star legendaries making the current dupes all but worthless, new currencies will be introduced making caps less valuable, balance changes will reduce the viability of commonly duped items (teo shot / explosive) and finally, I assume new game modes like seasonal ladders will give people a chance to start in a fresh new economy every few months.
---
I tried to combine the caps bobblehead and the perk that gives you more caps per caps stash and one stash gave me 220 caps
---
I was ganna spend it by dropping my first nuke in the game. But Bethesda sucks so I didnt. Didnt know what else to do in the game so I just didnt play it all...Not until I get to drop my nuke.
---
So I played some Odyssey and watching bad movies on Netflix now like The Mummy.
---
We'll have to see. Around the beta/launch, everyone was saying how the framerate bug couldn't be fixed because of engine limitations, but they managed to fix it.
---
They need to rework the game from the ground up, fix the shit right and hard reset the game. Give everyone who played prior to X date either something legit special in game or just a fuck ton of atoms since they love band aiding all their problems with that anyway. I think they'd gain far more people than they'd lose if tomorrow everyone had to start over completely but there were no game breaking bugs and random disconnects were only as frequent as they are in other large scale online games (not fucking often at all).
---
Right I never got that card, appreciate the help!
---
Full item wipe or even dupe wipe (assuming they can ID) is sadly a no go, it’d do too much damage to innocent people too (even if only duped wipe there’s people that may have traded not knowing they were dupes - though this is why I won’t trade with anyone I don’t know).
---
They need to fix the base issues so it’s largely moot:
---
- TSE weapons, just in general effects system, are poorly balanced.
---
- PvP is a broken mess and frankly I don’t think there’s any balancing it per se with existing weapons etc.  Frankly they need to make PvP damage based on weapon family/stats universal basically eliminate the effects bonus until/unless they can figure out a way to balance it.  If they insist on trying to balance it, they need to still keep how guns and armor work in PvP separate from PvE cause it’ll make it easier to balance both sides without f-in up the other like happens in MMOs.
---
- There needs to be some improvement to getting kill credits to deal with TSE one shot issues farming whether said adjustments solves it or another solution is found.  I’m not sure how you solve this direct since giving anyone in a certain proximity credit comes with its own issues of people leeching without attacking.  As others have said, providing a more meaningful method of farming legendary drops itself may sort this out in a way
---
Just use liquid cooling lol
---
Yep. I've gone in with zero steal and walked out with 150. 
---
Phrasing is vague. I think they mean a vendor that sells players.
---
That goes without being said. We all know they need to fix that, and they know that is the number 1 priority.
---
But I also want to make it clear that the community as a whole wants the cheaters punished as well. As evidenced by the support
---
No
---
But with the right perks it can 3-4 very consistently 
---
It's here: https://bethesda.net/en/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019
---
And split? Or get bruised and sad
---
If you are playing on PC you can change the color of your pip boy screen which also changes the color of the pip boy light.
---
As always its by messing with the ini file. 
---
There's no telling what came down with that space station.....
---
I find VATS works great for me with a two shot crossbow.
---
Almost always hits with body shots and one hit kills.
---
With my anti armour dragon it annihilates scorch beasts.
---
My experience seems to be the exception though
---
And yet here you are.
---
You know, squeakers? Annoying little kids with high pitched voices 
---
What do have lol
---
Muling is absolutely cheating. Without that exploit the effects of duping would be greatly mitigated
---
The top of a lookout tower might be fun if you're interested in engaging with the people.  Otherwise I would just hide in a large building because without interior maps it's impossible to tell exactly where people are.  I just finished the Monongah power plant with a stranger and didn't see them at all until it was almost completed.
---
I vendored a couple explosive flamers.
---
Get luck of the draw also. Will greatly help.
---
They squeak. 
---
Same as reddit name
---
In a week probably. 
---
Rivers/lakes don’t have limited gather speed this way, only pumps do.
---
A post above says you can [drink, spam gather, drink, spam gather, etc] on a pump to make gathering at a pump faster.
---
I do the same with with the registers, the ones behind the counter, at railroad stations. 
---
Factions oriented quests pkease, and I'm not talking bout "add BoS captain plz" but player fzctions oriented quests that gives benefit to those who organized themselves into communities.
---
Let us rebuild.
---
Not to be a dick or rude, but its all here. Theres been over 3 dozen posts since last night talking about this, and its mostly people coming out of left field talking about this "event", refusing to do any actual research (the term "researched" used very loosely here; literally just type words in a search bar or scroll down) and then downvoting ppl who try to link the actual truth of the matter.
---
Just scroll down or search "nuke" or "silos" in the search bar, theres no use in getting aggravated and making ANOTHER reddit thread about it at this point. You have to assume first that you aren't the only one dealing with this, before you treat it like an isolated incident. Do this by searching the subreddit to see if anything comes up first, before you make a post asking a question with a somewhat obvious that is quite literally dominating the subreddit rn.
---
Again, not tryna be a dick. But Ive just had enough over the past 12 hours, seeing people ask the same exact question over and over again.
---
If there are they dont have mics.
---
People I've talked to have been older. 
---
I've assisted a lot of people  that dont have mics
---
I learned this as a level 51 when I couldn't even put a dent in a god damn level 40 radscorpion. I hate them as Top of the World greeters.
---
Not what I'm talking about 
---
What’s a handmade
---
I mean, Ghost Riders in the Sky though.
---
Did I just hear the rare and majestic space duck?
---
Congratulations on basically reposting the same thing that's been posted here hundreds of times before.
---
I understand your frustration about it but how many times do we have to see the same exact post basically. It's like a less common "to the person that..." post
---
This is what I assumed they would do and is the best idea out of everything I've read here.
---
This would only result in idiots using MS paint to modify screenshots in order to get others banned. 
---
This is a tragic story, when you said “I had realized what I had done” I imagined you on your knees looking up into the sky as it rains down on the irradiated earth screaming and crying “WHY”  
---
I feel like pinball machines would be a good fit. 
---
Being able to craft a targeting range would be pretty cool. 
---
Could be the skeet shooter perk under perception. It massively narrows the spread of shotguns. It makes it as valid as a rifle for me.
---
Nice. I can clear out all that lead and stock up on a thousand shells to last me one long session. I appreciate it. 
---
Had friend across map get server issues while I spam crafted diluted stims, it bogs the entire server.
---
That is such a moronic response. Seriously, a 5 year old could pick apart your reasoning
---
I feel like the main thing about this is that the economy will be broken from the start of player vendors. People will have to seriously all drop their prices cause there'd be an oversaturation of items available, so in the long run it'll be a buyer's market since so many players have too much of an abbundance of goods to offer. 
---
Bad for the seller, good for the buyer. 
---
On more than a dozen occasion, before I made the decision to stop playing this remarkably-shit game, I accidentally duped several weapons and stacks of ammunition. I think your opinion is ridiculous and your hope for a functioning community-driven economy in Fallout 76 is also ridiculous.
---
1. PC
---
2. StevenHan
---
4. The duplication of Camp items when automatically stored when moving the CAMP still exists. For example I built a 100% budget camp. After moving it, the stored items occupied 134% of the budget.
---
Pretty sure up all night just reduces the negative effects that dehydration and starvation apply, doesn't reduce the speed at which you need food and water.
---
Loose mods in FO4 couldn't be scrapped like this.
---
The funny/sad thing is everytime they fix duping another dupe / hundreds more exploits are revealed at the same time
---
You forgot Scorchbeasts.
---
Killing or being killed with one hit is not “balance”
---
It totally does. I carry 50 missiles.
---
You could do teams of 3 and 2, have everyone turn on pacifist mode to prevent killing each other
---
As it turns out, after jumping to another server, this solved the problem for my particular issue.
---
20+ higher level ghouls and scorched I can live with - SM's are a pain in the backside.  Definitely do a server hop.
---
I’ve heard a few over mic, but only when trading. Usually people keep to themselves. 
---
Good luck supplying it with fuel. Even with ammosmith perk you only craft 9 at a time, and it costs lots of acid and oil to craft.
---
And 9 fuel is about .2 seconds of firing a flamer.
---
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, but I think you're moving too fast.
---
Check your ammo tab. A few things in there stack up quick.  Missiles, mini nukes an fusion cores weigh a ton.
---
Next, walk down your aid tan, stimpacks, radaway and and radx usually make up a good chunk.  
---
whats suspicious about it exactly?
---
You don't know what there doing or don't agree with what there doing (which is what exactly btw?) so therefore it must be suspicious and must be reported?
---
Bet you sit by the window writing down what time cars go past your house as well don't ya ;)
---
Perhaps disabled/reduced/rescaled legendary effects for pvp? 
---
They fixed it because they tied physics to the server I believe.
---
The real question is who doesn't
---
In other words, you are talking out of your ass.
---
So that people can make decisions? By reading reviews? But wait those current reviews are just a hate train circlejerk right? This is a *live-service* game. That means updates and changes. That means a review from last month is irrelevant, especially if the developer has been pushing through 'bugfix' and 'postlaunch' patches to improve the game.
---
It needs to be said because it is still relevant, otherwise someone is going to look at a review date, look at a patch note date and then end up with something that is still bad.
---
Yeah, lol, dude was having some issues 
---
That's cute. ;)
---
*If you* ***v******iew it in your inventory****,* *it'll only tell you one.*
---
*You need to* ***look at it properly*** *to see the full list of effects.*
---
What is the difference?
---
Also , since youre citing fo4, be careful of Bobby pins. they weigh quite a bit more in 76.
---
'It's stupid to think a publisher is responsible for the platform they release on'. Jeez probably a good idea to disable those since reading must be a real task for you.
---

---
I think it comes with the territory of moving a single-player game into multiplayer. Bethesda tried to walk the line here. 
---
I really hope never. Some things need to stay limited. 
---
Short pipe revolver with plumber perk
---
RuneScape admins have the power to spawn in anything and this was shown this year. Before that, you had people claiming this kind of stuff was not possible because support never did it.
---
Just because they don't do it doesn't mean there is no capability. If you have played any Fallout game, you know there are commands and logs for lots of stuff.
---
Monster Hunter doesn't charge me 20 dollars for a Kulve weapon, chief.
---
You can’t choose which ones to get rid of. 
---
On the trading subs, people are selling the serums for about 300 caps a piece so that might be an easier way to get the ones you want. 
---
Check out the sub market 76
---
There are bathrooms at every overlook.... Unload there next time.
---
&gt; My point is that I'm tired of media circle jerking what they already said. 
---
They said it before the patches. Does that mean they don't need to say it after the patches?
---
&gt;when it hasn't had time to over come the bugs it released with and expect them to be gone
---
2 months for a triple A studio. You must have some rock bottom standards if you don't expect a functioning product after that long.
---
 No. At that level you will be looking at Combat Shotguns doing almost as much damage, mine does 125, with 10 rounds and a faster cycle. Mine is an Armor Piercing Hardened one and is very nice. With a large Bayonet and some bash perks it destroys all kinds of stuff.
---
Depends on how much AP I've got XD
---
Well if you know any have them take a look at this thread cause you need the help. 
---
Explosive with a very shot range weapon sounds scary. 
---
You mean kids? I dunno. Seems like everyone I know that plays on PC is 25+.
---
Psychotic rainbow dash
---
Ilk known in ill0pq@s
---
They should have legendary PA pieces that have a chance to drop from the SQ only once a week. Kinda like end game loot in other mmo's
---
Oh god that's terrible, jump servers until you find one where they're not do high ?
---
Play the guitar...
---
Love it when people get my references XD
---
Combined with the ability that there are people working at Bethesda who DO know how to see what items are in what account. The general support people may not be able to help but there is guaranteed tracking of what is in whose account otherwise we would have nothing every time we logged in. Nor could the dupers actually dupe anything. 
---
I agree, and I think that it will help with player retention and provide for incentives to group 
---
Yes. Other vaults open and/orbpeople from beyond the map show up to investigate.
---
I feel this is my biggest gripe in the game. I always feel unprepared, because each time I go into an area, it's a crapshoot. Are the mobs in the area \*supposed\* to be this level, or did I just 'get lucky' because a level 100 was doing old quests?
---
Not to mention all the times I've gone to an area loaded with weapons/armor to battle what I saw 'last time', and there always seems to be a different type the 'next time' (e.g. last time robots, this time scorched, or SM, or whatever). 
---
Maybe they haven’t played RDR2 for 5 hours and can’t even figure out how to sell a rabbit.  My wife really wants me to play RDR, but I’m just not in the mood for its pacing. 
---
I’m glad 76 has so many options. I’m sure RDR gets fun, but for now I’m very happy in the wastes. 
---
That’s a pretty good concept.  Keeps anyone with legit items from losing them but really screws the dupers.
---
currently running into the same issue right now
---
tried re-logging to see if that would fix it, but I still only got the option to search for a cargobot to get a Keycard. After one more unsuccessful re-logging attempt, I now have 3 nuclear keycards in my inventory.  The Surveillance System Terminal isn't adding the option to search for Silos after completing the cargobot quest. 
---
hopefully this will be addressed and fixed in a future patch or hotfix or something!
---
B i g   I r o n
---
Just go back and do it later. All you get is shitty ultracite armor anyway.
---
Bluescreen is the computer, not the game btw.
---
Also, you don't need to fight the scorchbeast.. just loot a corpse. You can either run through or sneak without a problem
---
What level are you? Maybe just not ready for it I dunno, what platform are you on? I’ll do it along with you 
---
I seen someone do that. It was Line in the Sand with the Scorchbeasts. Someone went down. Someone else ran to them then left them there on the ground, then I ran to them and ressed them. I thought maybe they had no stimpacks, but that seems like another possibility. 
---
Can you explain why lone wanderer and agility girl/boy doesn’t work together? I never used lone wanderer before but now since I’ve got all the perks I’ve wanted, I’ve been experimenting with others and got lone wanderer as recommended by other players. 
---
It's bad but it's not Final Fantasy 14 bad... Neither does it have a monthly subscription that's going to pay for large scale changes outside of DLC. 
---
This is the game they made, no patching is going to make fundamental changes to that. With patches it could be a smooth, balanced, fun experience and that's the best you can hope for. 
---
Ive also done this, turned out a few of the people are actually German or French could also be a resonn for some people with out mics 
---
Literally 5 seconds of google. Give it a try, or just be a dick.
---
This guy totally has the cannibalism perk card enabled.
---
As someone said in this sub before, some people will shit in their pants just so you have to smell it. 
---
There are just those kinds of people. 
---
Funny, I gave away hundreds of every ammo at the same time today in the same place, only I’m 76.  
---
Just reset everyone after the beta is over 
---
/s

*People. Can't. Use. A. Feature. If. They. Don't. Know. It. Exists.*

Make it you can only have a set number of each gun. 
---
Blank accounts can't carry anything/you have to be above 20 to be able to carry a decent weight.
---
You can see stash items when trading with someone, so you can cancel trade if you see they have excessive amounts of things. 
---
Have done this numerous times... Ain't nobody got time fo that.
---
Unintelligent creatures or lowbie trash will attack your resources while the big guys take down your turrets. Occasionally anyway.
---
Dropped 3 nukes on whitespring in different servers
---
Still faces some challenges but yes. Some things have gotten better. Respec was a good implementation.
---
Nice 
---
Ive taken a good handful of the 10-15 levels and made weapons armor. I would message them, seemed happy.
---
If you plan on ANY Whitesprings runs, put the level 3 Blocker card back into your build.
---
You’re welcome 😉 
---
Yeah exactly or even just have her drop higher quality gear once a week, i.e 3 star and up legendaries
---
Do you have a picture? Don't think I have done a crossed that outfit! 
---
Same with Xbox, it’s what I use. 
---
I'm not sure how you are supposed to get in there normally, but if you clip in there (like with a glitch) there are a few work benches, scrap, and a plan on a desk. It's nothing too exciting and seems like a complete normal room.
---
I don't know about a subreddit dedicated to players homes but r/Fo76creations and r/fo76FilthyCasuals tend to have a good deal of camp pictures.    
---
The cleanest interior walls in the game are in the barn set.  I hear you can get them from the Watoga vendor, I think I've also seen them on Graham.  I think I got them from a workshop quest.  Hopefully they release some clean walls soon, it's a very commonly requested thing.
---
It doesn’t matter if you disagree or not. Facts don’t care for your opinion. What needs to happen is for these duplication glitches to get patched. That should be the first priority.
---
"Hi Beth, you've gotten taller!"
---
   "Shall we resume stabbing?!"
---
&gt;Poor Ol' Tommy Jones who only gets to play 8 hours a week and wants to roleplay as a Trader near Whitesprings ain't gonna stand a chance next to the guy with 30,000 Nuka Cherry's and a hundred duplicated TSE weapons of every type, all serums, plans, ammo, etc.
---
Considering Bethesda only allowed set play-times during the "beta" despite people having jobs or personal lives that didn't fit around Bethesdas chosen timed sessions, I doubt they care much for whether or not players only have jobs or other factors that only allows them a certain amount of free time a week, I imagine if you don't play their game as much as other people do then you're not that important to them.
---
Find players to level up with by doing events, and eventually nukes when you guys have a decent PA. There’s a fallout 76 reddit discord with lfg section if you need help looking for people, or just post here on this subreddit.
---
My first toon never had to do the quest. I dunno if it was cause I found the holotape before the questline or what. I had to do it on my other guy tho.
---
Yes, I  like that the power armor glitch isn't an issue for me now.  The camp improvements and respec are nice. I like the extra storage.  Plenty of improvements. 
---
An Auction House would be the most effective way.  Having your items being available to everyone makes selling items far easier than setting up a shop at your C.A.M.P. especially with the limited number of players on each server.
---
Holidays a bit much...programmers and dev's need breaks too. They aren't mindless drones.
---
Lol maybe not I'm not perfect and I felt bullied enough on this game I needed to vent ,I may add plenty seem too agree.Thank you for giveing me my next bible passage to study.Truly spiritual growth is a process for those who are truly trying too improve always.
---
You can absolutely go straight to the last one. Or even go straight to the corpse to complete the quest.
---
I had to restart twice due to crashing and finally just went for it. 
---
TSE= Two Shot Explosive.
---
It's a form of weapon that everyone's getting stiffies over, because they all want guns that basically reduce enemies to lvl 6 scorched difficulty.
---
Defeats the fun, and fear of playing anyway.
---
Why not make a pipe revolver or 5 knock a few pistol perks on, and spend some time being shit scared of Mr Gutsy's and Yaoi Guai for a while? 
---
Make it fun!!!
---
By the serums for the specific mutations you want
---
You cant really ban players for something that's in the game like that. It's their fault it's in the game and they should just try their best to fix it.
---
It’s a player vendor not a character vendor, though, so it’s proably just going to start posting to reddit for me.
---
Nothing I guess perhaps it is my fault for feeling bullied.
---
That Jingle Jangle Jingle!
---
Boi this better be a joke or ima whoop u
---
Thanks, I'll keep up the good work!
---
It’s been written about since before the beta. The fuck are you talking about. 
---
Wtf man, OP's in trouble here.  Splurge on one the big goats for added effect.
---
BIG IRON
---
The very base gameplay loop and the concept of this game are both 20/10. Survival game is post apocalyptic wasteland is perfect.
---
Pretty much everything else past that is unfortunately pretty downhill.
---
Im level 54, I also quit the questline. I made it past the satellites and into the mine, but cant get past all the ridiculously high level mr gutsy robots. The game gets really difficult really fast at that point, you can't even compete without tse weapons, which I've never found and wont buy (feels like cheating to me to buy). And I play alone, which also doesn't help. Need a good team for that mission
---
Are all three of those rng at vendors? Thinking about starting to actually go look for outfits (by look o mean pray I find them)
---
Wipes on an Alpha or even a Beta game is understandable. Wipes on a released game? No. Starting over is very different from having your progress wiped out at a whim.
---
I have also had a few restarts in a bunch of Bethesda games. Choosing to try a new style or maybe play out to story differently (Main Railroad? Main BoS?) is different. 
---
I'm level 34, don't even have power armor, yet. 
---
Whitesprings is constantly nuked for any server that I get in to. It's ridiculous. 
---
I wish your parents had done a better job.
---
This is really embarrassing.
---
The crafting system or at least the interface needs to be reworked. I'd be ok with it too, but think of how retroactively applying it would need to work in a practical sense. There are learnable recipes that require boiled water -- so you'd need a detection system layered on top to figure out if an individual character had learned the boiled water version -- or you'd need to identify a "water" material and determine that both boiled and purified met that need -- it would be a bigger lift than most people think. 
---
I agree it need to happen, but it's not necessarily an easy fix from a programming perspective. 
---
Ah. A friend of mine is using a melee build, and he wears Grognack's outfit with a super sledge. 
---
Not all melee builds need to be two handers; that card is not needed with my Bastet, although I’d wedge it in if I had 17 points in strength 
---
Welcome to the MMO industry. 
---
It's random, it's like rolling dice. My best bet would be to get them all and use radaways carefully and hope you lose the ones you don't want. That way if you lose a good one there's not a list of other ones you have to risk getting. 
---

Nope just hunt a lot of radstag Brahmin and use good with salt.Its easier than it sounds.Thought about vegan mutation with starched genes,but I've managed.

the easy fix is to search for it on the market reddit. you usually get them for 1k or sometimes even below. way better than buying from the ingame vendor

You can put them in toxic water that you can't turn into boiled water. I made this mistake when setting up my camp outside of Grafton once.

Nice use of a quonset you have going there, pretty badass!
---
Maybe it's a progressing storyline? 
---
I hope that is gonna  work, i am going to try it out tomorrow
---
Tried it with no change
---
Will do
---
compete with whom? 
---
Jukebox :D
---
No info, I'm bored, started having workshop warfare. Everyone just ends up pulling their tse out then it depends who has more people on their team. It's trash. 
---
And some of us just hunt the map all day looking for fresh bounty’s of any number so we can swoop down on you as quickly as possible and jack your sweet loot before you have a chance to stash it.   People in power Armor never expect the dirty half naked guy to two hit them and take all their shit, so sweet. Sooo sweet
---
In my opinion the damage done is already conciderable. I found a way out by just pretty much ignoring high level player market, but Twoshot explosive weapons are worth nothing anymore.
---
Every time i see that lvl 35 Two Shot Explosive Handmade with reload speed, i sigh internally.
---
Respec, camp bulldozing, your camp not automatically being dismantled if you log into a world where that space is occupied, stash size increase.
---
These have all been positive changes. This game is going to improve by centimeters, with fan input.
---
I have a rule in my shop. No afk on the instruments. Someone did that once and was gone for 8 minutes. I don't have the guitar in my camp anymore. Literally every other instrument is there but I just can't listen to the guitar loop anymore. Those loops do not stand up to extreme repetition. Something the radio strives to do. 
---
It's more about being harried by people who are looking to bother someone PvP equals two players not one pestering another cause he's bored.
---
Flamer has a longer range than you'd think from my experience. Lots of fun to use.
---
Too bad it's a (very fast) race to see what runs out first, durability or ammo, every time you pull the trigger.
---
With Gunsmith 5, Luck of the Draw 3, and Weapon Artisan 3, it's almost worth using. *Almost.*
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.

Eh....it does a pretty good job at being a scavanger hunt. Granted you're not exploiting. Lol
---
Shouldn’t less chance of diseases/faster curing without aid be endurance not int? Don’t know how smarts helps your immune system. Maybe reduce the disease chance of foods that you cook cause you cook it better or something? That’s the most believable I can come up with 
---
Oh gotcha! I didn’t know that so I will remember for future reference :)
---
I think enemies scale. 
---
That's likely only on your server..??
---
Keep in mind if you have startched genes equipped you won't gain mutations
---
If that’s the case, they need tweaking. 
---
That’s not the flavor you’re getting. Just saying 
---
That is because the people handling the customer relations do not have the tools to fix item and character issues. There may be technical concerns against letting those customer service agents change variables with in the game.  As this is the engine's first iteration of a (M)MORPG, the tools simply may have not been made as a lack of foresight.
---
The developers that are updating the game certainly do. 
---
Don't worry, I wouldn't give much credence to relationship advice given from such little context. 
---
Lol down votes for saying big corporations are more effective than Mom and Pops. You guys are hilarious.
---
There are people who will game the system no matter what. Demanding restrictions on things because you don't think they are fair is the biggest joke yet. There will be people who can out produce casuals.  
---
no the ban hammer isnt coming for anyone lmao. unless you get someone on video duping then you have no way to get them banned. and whats to say these people already didnt give out their loot to other players? i mean if i was a duper id dupe mad shit then give it all away en masse. so are the people who received my duped items guilty of duping? i mean everyone would want a super high damaging rifle, i mean who wouldnt. now what if i didnt tell them it was duped? are they still guilty? your argument has so many holes and thats not even on top of the fact that its impossible for bethesda to look into peoples inventories lmfao. there isnt code in the engine to get rid of dupers or protect against dupers.
---
They should reset their accounts and send a message that says “Should have duplicated your account!”
---
Nah just 5-8 should be enough, some points to make it break slower and fusion cores last longer if you need, everything else is mostly crafting the different mods and repair it better/fewer mats 
---
someone else posted that they should make the top of the world a trading post for all players
---
My favorite song. That women’s voice is so soothing 
---
1 handed or two handed shouldn't matter at all. It's just nice to have since to have because it ignores so much armor. If you have a legendary melee that has the perk built in, sure, go ahead and take it out. Otherwise, I'd say it's an absolute must in any melee build.
---
No but I stop what I'm doing to listen to a radio playing the shanty town shack song.
---
It's better than Nuka Dark Rum. 
---
Joining an event , fast traveling , paying caps, and the event ends in two mins
---
This didn't happen to me until today. I don't know if it's the nukes being offline or what but almost every random encounter save for one today resulted in someone trying to PvP, getting a bounty while I'm in pacifist and me just fast traveling away. Seemed to happen more with really low levels (&gt; 10) perhaps just wondering what would happens, but I had 2 level 80+ today as well.

---
I've twice seen people camped here with this blocked off, and been disconnected from the server shortly thereafter.
---
There is definitely something fishy here.
---
I'm pretty sure someone at Bethesda can write a database query for players with more than X of specific items.
---
bet your wireless Podunk internet
---
Oh maybe. It’s on PS4 and might’ve been gooified
---
Was unaware of that. Still, the normal shot fires several pellets (I think it's 6, but I'm not certain)
---
You lose your level in caps though. 
---
I enjoy finding mine I'm just here to laugh at ridiculous prices and such
---
Currently a bug with nukes as they cant be launched
---
I've seen them floating a few times. Also found this fun bit of voodoo: https://xboxclips.com/Supposeda3/63af4680-3bee-42b6-a412-dc93488f88b7
---
Yes sorry it was autocorrected
---
You can do hat without a perk too. I did it without a perk.
---
I don't care about the bans, but I'll likely not play this again seriously for a while if the duped items are still around.
---
It's usually just scorched. You got bad luck.
---
They are planning on adding new quests so if you come back their will be more to do.
---
...it doesn’t actually take more than a day or two to level that high once you reached the point of using nukes.
---
Levels would roll in like it was going out of style in Whitespring.
---
It’s pretty ignorant to expect people not to have some kind of issue when the only end game content is: grind Whitespring for mats or fight SBQ for terrible loot and deal with the fact that she’s bugged half the time.
---
Especially since the fighting and looting and exploration is the defining traits of the game; cause there’s certainly not enough story to keep you involved and even collecting plans is terrible because of RNG and how plans are level locked.
---
There’s just not a lot to keep one engaged. Just one gameplay loop grind that doesn’t have much variety or seeming point.
---
I’ve had fun with the game, but I also haven’t picked it up in weeks because there’s no point and no incentive.
---
People were promised something rich in content and its ... just so the opposite. 
---
Wow does it really? I didn’t even know you get more raw mats from higher int let alone the diminishing returns int passives really do suck 
---
Bethesda studios is on this sub
---
Prob means enemies spawned for higher levelled player. I was in Sugar Grove just exploring for junk. Got to the end and a high level player came in. All the enemies reset and were much higher than me.
---
Can someone post me a photo of where the vendor is located
---
Have to do the power plant quests. On 3 characters now, got each one in order till the fusion.
---
Filthy casuals sub
---
People duping means nothing to me.  To be fair, I play solo, so I don’t really care what other people have.
---
Until you find one, I can craft you a new one at your proper level. If you're on xbox. gt theonlycuregirl
---
I mean, I clearly said farming. Don't see how you miss that. I've farming her since release. Still haven't gotten the insect glaive I need from her 
---
I hope Bethesda understands how bad this is
---
I met one. Was reasonable at first, following me for a bit while I going to the top of the world and then proceeded to attack someone afk at the station because I wouldn't fight them.
---
Turned off pacifist, pulled out my super sludge and gave them a respawn.
---
I think it was more along the lines of Todd's crazy pvp make the story idea. After all gta v was rockstars first go into online and they had a working pacifist mode
---
What does that mean random encounter creature
---
Dense armor mods significantly reduce explosive damage.
---
Don’t get me wrong, this is one of my very few complaints with the game. I just feel like it could be better than it currently is. 
---
Pump a few mags of armor piercing .38 into them and they drop like the bugs they are.
---
Yeah he’s pretty shitty.
---
Actually, I'd rather them stop all trades and loot bags instead of implementing more features for trading. This would shut down duping cause no one else can benefit from it.
---
Is that why ive played for 10 hours today without seeing a scorch beast?
---
Good luck using it laser weapons break way to fast for much usage. Although on a lighter note congrats! I still keep my vampy explody laser rifle in storage in hopes that one day that it may become useful.
---
Known bug they are working on it, [Hotfix tomorrow](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abh90l/nukes_are_bugged_not_disabled_for_an_event/ed1n4zx/?context=1000)
---
Oh yeah? Tell that to the weight glitches who are sad there is no more easy way to glitch weight anymore. 
---
You don’t have to make everything perfect to make things much better. 
---
Thank you, I'll stumble over that way. 
---
Something to keep them occupied between giving blowjobs and eating their own poo. 
---
Its will end up being a 2 way petting zoo
---
JW, what ideas do YOU have that would effectively  monitor this issue. What's something new you can bring to a post like this that hasn't been said before.
---
•Server wipes would work but in the case it wipes everyone's player tons would stop playing. It's unfair to the fair players.
---
•resetting caps would really suck for the person who gained theirs normally
---
•Bethesda wont Even give us feedback, why would they open fresh servers for a dupe free experience 
---
•deleting all items? How would they track every single duped item? What about the innocent person who unknowingly spent 10k caps on plans and weapons from others? 
---
•Bans aren't as simple to dish out as many people seem to think. If they banned every person who has touched a duped item (assuming they even knew) that's probably a vast majority (suspecting and unsuspecting) of their playerbase gone. Given the state of this game and the way it's been marketed etc that's just a silly idea to destroy what's left of a already very damaged game.
---
Many other 'fixes' usually involve people getting fucked over or an untraceable fix.
---
The games not In a great spot right now and it's really sad to see.
---
Tl;dr: what's something new they can do to fix this? The games most too far gone and it's a shame
---
Thanks for the confirmation. 
---
This happened to me a few time with different quests after a few days the quest showed up again
---
And if they dexide to only have 4999 TSE rifles?...
---
Knock that limit down to 4500. And so on, until everyone can carry about 300 of something, because if you're carrying 300+ nuka colas, stimpaks and corn soup, you're not playing it right!
---
Good luck.
---
This, especially if you have contractor. It'll reduce overall total, rather than letting each item round up.
---
When my base got totaled, it would've cost 3 aluminum to repair each item individually or just 1 if I used the camp repair all.
---
Man. I like this game, but I'm disappointed with it a surprisingly large amount of the time.
---
You never hear of people getting banned for buying gold or items. I guess because those are the kind of people game developers and publishers want to stay on the good side of. People who spend money on games. Some people spend money on alcohol. Some people spend money on cars. Some people spend money on vacations. And some spend money on games. If a game is designed well people wouldn't feel the need to spend more money to buy stuff. They may feel a desire to spend money on microtransactions, if the system and stuff offered is good and worth it. It's a slippery slope though and it leads to nickel and diming BS which just makes people hate the game and company. There should be a clear path to getting whatever you want in the game, that doesn't boil down to kill hundreds of random mobs that drop completely random items and hope for the best, or server hop a few hundred times to check vendor inventory and maybe you will get what you want. That isn't how a game is meant to be. It's meant to have complex systems and paths to work towards. Server hopping and mindlessly grinding Whitesrpings just doesn't cut it, so people will just take the easy way, the way that doesn't make playing a game a full time job filled with bugs and frustrations.
---
Where abouts did you find that shotgun. Also do you have a plan for it or no?
---
😂
---
 The pan is to eventually do that, but until then it is multiplayer.  They spelled it out when describing the game, we just have to be patient and deal with it.  Take a break for a while if it frustrates you.
---
 Would be a nice thing, hell I would finally use some of my atoms in the store for that feature.
---
Do anything to get banned?
---
Yeah, here's the chart from the official guide.
---
Value, Crafted Item Condition Bonus, Scrapping Yield
---
1, +0%, +0%
---
2, +5%, +20%
---
3, +10%, +33%
---
4, +15%, +40%
---
5, +25%, +46%
---
6, +30%, +50%
---
7, +35%, +53%
---
8, +40%, +56%
---
9, +45%, +58%
---
10, +50%, +60%
---
11, +55%, +61%
---
12, +60%, +62%
---
13, +65%, +64%
---
14, +70%, +65%
---
15, +75%, +66%
---
So yeah, best bang for point is the first 4 points invested (since it starts at 1), after that it starts dropping off heavily. First 4 points you put in is a 46% increase in yield. Investing another 10 only increases it another 20%. From 5 to 15 you get less than half the increase for more than double the points invested from 1-5.
---
New year, new loot. 
---
Theres a dis-_-c()rd server I can send you the link to if you message me.
---
If I say the actual word or post the link my comment while be deleted.
---
Oh
---
I used to weight glitch all the time because I had bulk weight that for some reason wasnt showing up in my items. That glitch didnt impact anyone unless you're carrying stupid amounts of weight.
---
Dont get me wrong, I WANT this game to survive (and I didnt even pay for it). Its just a shame how the game has been presented and a cheating glitching everything broke asf game.
---
If they say "Items can't be scrapped and duplicated" these items have a unique ID, which means they identify the accounts with an duped item.
---
I believe the western and sniper are atom shop purchases 
---
I gotta ask... Have you actually read the plans, or are you just keeping them in your inventory?
---
If you've read them, I'm not really sure why they won't show up.
---
Basically there are spots on the map that spawn a different unmarked mini event whenever you walk up to them. Sometimes it's a deathclaw nest with a mommy and eggs, sometimes it's a crashed satellite with rare materials in it.
---
Sometimes a low level creature will spawn by itself; this is the "taming event/encounter", and you will be able to tame this creature and send it back to your base. Again, you'll know because the creature will be underlevelled (like a level 21 deathclaw) and it will be by itself. 
---
The best place is major roads, I think. Walk the main route up and down the mire and the bog. Theres also a few spots right outside of watoga.
---
That would be super helpful, maybe not something Bethesda would. Maybe like a fan would. But it’s a great idea I’d definitely use it. 
---
If i didnt say Im joking, Im most definitely serious
---
It’s a video game, of course there will be kids.  Kids are in all games, regardless of rating.  To expect anything different would be silly.  We were all kids playing video games, once.  
---
I stay in a party, so no big deal.
---
You can mute, so no big deal.
---
Your comment is painfully likely.
---
I wish your parents taught you that a video game is for fun and if you're not having fun then stop playing it. If I wasn't meant to PvP, then why is there a PvP mode? Why are players that have pacifist mode on still in the same lobby as people who have it off? PvP is a part of the game. Why tell people to stop playing the game a certain way if it's literally allowed in the game?
---
if they're on ps4 bluescreen is an application crash a semi-common occurrence with 76
---
Here is my biggest gripe about it....if you grind and spend the time to find something good it should feel special..but if everyone has everything than what are we grinding for..duping kills any looter shooter. Time spent needs to be rewarded not thrown in your face by someone who did almost nothing to find something special
---
I would be fine with this actually lol
---
LOL
---
It really is. If you let someone "bully" you, which isn't a real thing just walk away lmfao, then you're just making yourself feel that way.
---
Make all duped items shoot the user, problem solved, jk
---
Such is life. At least they are being quick with the fix.
---
Yeah I've already read them... I'm also level 50
---
No that's the actual price 
---
They really do need to fix this. Make it so they appear friendly instead of hostile, and if someone kills them, let us stimpack them as a "repair" option. These tamable beasts are hard enough to find, it's awful when they get killed by a spooked player 10 minutes later.
---
Also let us name them, I need my Sid the megasloth. 
---
I only have the Lite Armor category showing up
---
It's offputting as a new/lower player. I agree.
---
Thats why the economy is important in games like this
---
I have a super sledge with 40% swing speed increase, instigating and vampires. It swings about the same speed as a ski sword or your average medium 1h weapon. This weapon is god mode, I 1 hit everything and can clear hordes of lvl 68 mobs in seconds. My only problem is that I don't use it very often because I want my friends or others in nuke zones to get tag xp too.
---
tried talking to rose again?
---
Lmfao what. How about you just ignore them instead of feeding the troll
---
I mean they did it to nms to better the game and the community... You are a very upset person and calling people tards over the Internet is very easy I suppose. People have done this for years... It's nothing new. 
---
Theyve been worth that much since beta 🤷🏻‍♂️ probably intended to stop people writing "rude sentences"
---
They still attack, they just don't do damage. 
---
I love super destructive overpowered baseball bats and machine guns as much as anyone playing.
---
BUT... I don't want to keep getting kicked because some fuckhead wants to tank the game and fuck it for the people who WANT to grind it and have an experience.
---
And another thing, if these idiots are always killing my server, why am I NOT getting a dirty OP shotgun, or 200 nuka cola for freebies?
---
*If you're gonna wreck shit,  share the spoils people!!*
---
What are you on
---
No, purely because all of the changes were things that should've been addressed during the BETA.
---
Figuring out a month after launch that having your CAMP wiped every time you join a server might be a bad thing is impossible to miss.
---
All the basic quest, inventory, PA, weapon, perk, crafting bugs aren't really "improvements" and are just Bethesda working to make the game what it should've been on release.
---
Even once they actually get to releasing new areas/quests/vaults I doubt they're going to be able to do much about the constant crashes which more seem like inherent limitations with the engine/server side of things.
---
We're now 6 weeks past release and people still have their game or server crashing frequently. Even if I try and bulk a bunch of stuff on a workbench the server becomes unresponsive frequently.
---
So remember this post when Vault 96 or whatever gets opened up and people still post on here every 10 minutes about losing hours of work because the game/server crashed.
---
That's a weird reason to cause discord among a community. Deleting posts for containing a word?
---
Fair enough 
---
Deadass?
---
Ty!
---
With other vendors as the OP mentioned.  
---
&gt; feeding the troll
---
That doesn't mean what you think it means, or you completely misread my post.
---
*confused emoting*
---
&gt; EDIT: after posting I apparently got voted down by soyboys; no doubt because I called camp building an “interior design simulator” instead of the preferred term “safe space simulator.”
---
Salt
---
What?! That's insane.
---
I bet they'll be awesome again and release the vending machines in the Atom Shop on sale. 
---
Dies anyone know if there's any plans on respecs?
---
Duping effects everyone
---
Even if its a bluescreen on PC it can be the result of the program and not the user's computer.
---

---
Wait wait wait we can talk about this I mean shit man grinding takes way to long and some people don't have that kind of time so maybe umm not do that
---
Yea, if I store stuff ever since a week to 2 weeks ago, if I relog some or all those objects disappear.

I have 10 charisma so I can revive players with alcohol and it has thrips its effect for me. 
---
I only had scorched, ranging levels 38-68. Well, in the mine. 
---
A free market will solve that problem. No one is going to buy a 999999 2SE/TSE. Mostly because the cap is 25k but also because someone will sell it for less. 
---
Yeah I think it is 6. Goes from 6-7.
---
Can't people still do that with the letter stickers? Seems pretty silly if that's the reasoning.
---
I have been booted off of the server on some quests that showed up as daily quests, and those were lost for good. A brotherhood quest in which I needed to locate a lost soldier was one of them, and one (not a Rose quest) where I was issued a weapon and supposed to hunt animals of different species was another. 
---
I haven't done all of the Rose quests, but I think it would depend on how the quest appeared. ... The type of quest that it was. 
---
I have a Rose quest that I haven't completed. Check down in the miscellaneous section. 
---
I server hopped for like 3 days and didnt get it. Day 2 she spawned, but didnt have the plan smhh
---
Second time I saw her, she had it. That's definitely the best spot, I would think; its all just luck I guess. Maybe don't get discouraged if she doesnt have the plans the first time, like I did lol
---
Get the perk to reduce it down to 9000k
---
You can tame animals for your camp, but you'll need animal friend, some free space in your camp budget, and a lone animal spawned all by itself.
---
Nothing in stored. I can't even scrap anything anymore 
---
You can spell anything you want with them. Hell yeah make them expensive as shit.
---
Dude after people power leveled in the first few weeks they complained about not having something to do end game.
---
What level is your armorer perk ? Each plan has a tier level I know for example I can’t see
---
Certain armors unless I have my armorer perk on or my science perk etc 
---
You have to connect a terminal up to its power, but even once I did that I couldn't really get it to do much.
---
If you had a friend to buy it you may as well just us a storage mule as unlimited storage and achieve the same.
---
Dang. Sounds like I need to go back again. Only made it to the mine once, and got absolutely destroyed by Mr gutsys lvl 50+
---
Hook it up.
---
Ive been saying this to my buddies i few times too. The perk system is not friendly for anyone over lvl 50 and really just ends up having most people swap cards around a lot after lvl 50. There's no uniqueness because if you want to craft you swap out for crafting perks, you want a melee build, you swap cards. I feel like the only thing giving slight uniqueness to builds is the the stat allocation, but for passive cards it doesnt even matter sine you can just swap out for whatever you need them for at the time.
---
I'm PS4. But I think I'll be good knowing that I can skip through all of the satellites and go straight to the mine.
---
Pretty smart. Leave it out of reach of casual players. 
---
You lost 7 at once from 1 radaway? 
---
Good point. 
---
Fully ranked at level 3
---
Seems legit xD
---
You can get a fusion generator from starting up the reactors like posiden 
---
It does not affect the loner players, at all.
---
I’m not believing this post. Don’t use the hand pumps you can build at camps. They take too long.  Just go to any dirty water and you can collect all you need in a minute.

Also some recipes use purified water.

---
The event, Leader of the Pack is good for lower level legendary weapons and armor. You have to find and kill three wolf packs, Each leader is a legendary and I've gotten 3 each time. There is a 4th leader wolf that may/may not drop something.    
---
They are all around level 10 so bring an ally or have good gear/perks. Not only good XP for one quest but at least 3 legendaries you can use or give to new players.
---
message me.
---
I like these ideas...but an offline version would be best so we can still sell stuff even though not playing.
---
ok.
---
&gt; Again, not tryna be a dick.
---
try harder not to be a dick.  it's not working.
---
Yup, same here
---
You dont need TSE anything to clear glassed cavern. Maybe try a melee or shotgun build? I was farming that quest with randoms at level 60 with a vampires lead pipe. 
---
Yup. Not only refund but my time has a price. For 200 hours that's my standard 140hr wage plus 60hrs overtime. That'll be just over $5k for my contribution thanks.
---
A wipe is 1)a waste of time and an insult to every non duper. 2)really not needed with a tweak or two that won't affect anyone too much

Except in FO4 your settlements actually could successfully defend themselves against threats (I've had them succeed without intervening); so this game is actually a STEP BACKWARD in that department.
---
Happens literally 80% of the time to me.

1. Its not circle jerking if you make 1 review or other type of article of video. So you must not understand what circle jerking is. Also I have said that its okay to make a review or other form of criticism just to not keep making them without the game changing enough to warrant another one. Constantly showing the problems everyone knows  for content is circle jerking.

2. Once again this obviously proves you haven't played the game in question and noticed the bugs and balances that need to be made. I gave them 6 months to fix the bugs and balances which is a reasonable amount for the problems they have. 
---
Sidenote: What did the last quote have with my point? What point are you trying to prove with it. The game has a tremendous amount of bugs due to its early release. You understand I'm not trying to defend the game for having bugs I'm saying it shouldn't be circle jerked for free content.

I currently have the Trapper armor in there

The Flatwoods monster is listed separately, unless it just ticks both at once

I have the rank of general but it still won’t let me into the silos at the hand scanners, I’ve trued logging in and out but nothing is working. Anyone else have this issue?
---
Honestly wig
---
Yeah I noticed that, but I wouldn’t put it past them hahaha
---
Sometimes logging out snd back in helps me.
---
I didn't even consider spending atoms...I was hoping for a simple update.
---
But yeah I would, too.
---
That’s crap, but whatever
---
There's no chat period on PC.
---
Was it purple?
---
I tried to take a workshop once and an enemy just spawned underground. Not even a tunneler type either, I think it was a fog crawler. That workshop was just unclaimable on that server (even built artillery nearby and shelled it, didn't do damage).
---
Instead of a mule character, I have a better idea which I've already sent to BGS.    
---
Why not create and implement a mail system like WoW has?    
---
In WoW, you can mail gold and a limited number of items in 'mail' to any other player; including your own. There are mailboxes all around that world you can get your mail. However, your personal Bank stash is limited. This would facilitate trading even better.    
---
You wouldn't even have to meet the char like you do now to trade in76.    
---
BGS needs to change the naming system though since all our characters have the same tag.  
---
Ya a moderator got mad at me and told me that you can't advertise discord channels.
---
You can find them in the wild. Idk where, but its possible. Because I sure as shit have never had the funds to buy it from Graham but I have unlocked the items. 
---
Anytime my settlements got attacked I would receive the "help defend x settlement" quest, if I didn't go help, it would fail. Every time. Despite having turrets/walls/heavily armed settlers. 
---
Scorchbeasts don't take settlements depending on how they spawn, has nothing to do with the defenses present.
---
The Enclave doesn't want to make it public knowledge that they exist. 
---
The stash needs a major increase imo. I made a new character today and picked up everything I found except plants and meat. Scrapped it all down and already sitting at 546 pounds at level 16.
---
What events does D2 force you to play to progress?
---
Only pet that stays neutral and actually fights back against invaders is the snallygaster currently. He's a level 14 good boy. Not as aware and strong as the bear, but, he's nice.
---
I'm sure having 3 letters in your camp and maxing out the camp budget is how they solve the rude sentences peoblem.
---
you can do that but the default servers you join onto will be of your region 
---
I've had it a few times. Its either an issue with your internet connection or the much more likely answer is Bethesda's login servers are crapping out (which is normal)
---
Known bug, [Hotfix tomorrow](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abh90l/nukes_are_bugged_not_disabled_for_an_event/ed1n4zx/?context=1000).
---
Thing is they could quite easily let us have companions. If you're in a team of 4, you get squat. 3, you can bring a dog, 2 or less you can have a bigger dude like a super mutant or a robot. And honestly it'd be a nice workaround to the stash limit if you could store stuff on them. 
---
Change servers. That usually fixes the problem. If not close the game correctly and restart.
---
Yeah, they usually would fail, but like I said, I've had them succeed automatically before. I usually don't leave it to chance though (just sometimes I completely missed the "under attack" notification so I never knew it was until the resolved message appeared).
---
They're still looking for good skins to o-o-override!
---
Fuuuuuck that sucks dude. I'm on day 3 or 4 now too looking for this damn Jet Pack and another Calibrated Shocks. The fact that we have to do this is really annoying. 
---
Under cryptids, there is alien and Flatwoods. I gotta go kill one of them now. I’ll be right back
---
Honestly, I just whack away with melee. Mole Miner Gauntlet was my best friend until I got the Blade of Bastet (which you can craft at higher levels as you go). I can do 10-15 levels above me unless I got mobbed...and overconfident. 
---
The company makes bottles not liquor. It's "Silver Screen Bottling Company". It's probably bulk bought Spirit not a boutique rum. The product is the bottle.
---
What are you going to do when there are ranged enemies?    
---
Exactly. You can prioritize melee but focus on another weapon type, IMO Rifles so you can do damage until you a) find that enemy or b) it lands or whatever.
---
If you get ambushed by high level players with TSE shotguns, you'll be affected.

U can have more than 2 stars on your gun, you can have 3 right now, and a possibility of 4 with sorch killer... so... any extra legendary "tech" should work better.
---
I had mine mysteriously disappear in a server crash. Frustrating, but not devastating.

I've had a couple of vultures steal my junk too. That was more frustrating. 
---
Same issue, taking up 16% of my budget, can place or scrap large water purifier. Need fix.

---
I feel like the problem here is that most of those 200 hours is a grinding loop that just manages to catch you off guard with how it makes time pass.
---
You have this checklist of things to do and whiles it’s not *fun* it keeps you engaged enough to complete it 10 hours later.
---
Does a game like that deserve praise? 
---
In previous Bethesda titles there was always another stone to uncover another path down the quest to try and more.
---
In FO76, players end up spending days grinding and exploring, expecting to run into those magical moments from previous titles, but then it never happens.
---
It’s a game that seems utterly designed to have you thinking:
---
“Just a little more...”
---
It plays on psychology such as the Sunk-Cost Fallacy.
---
200 hours doesn’t mean they got their money’s worth; it just means that sometimes that’s how long it took someone turning over every rock in optimism that their feelings are misplaced.
---
200 hours of grind =/= 200 hours of content or fun
---
That is there number one priority (hopefully) and I never claimed otherwise. Banning players who have duplicated does solve the problem of... cheaters. It sets an example/precedent, it removes bad and harmful players from the game and prevents them from future transgressions, and also locks their accounts filles with duplicated items
---
If it's a glitch like this in a regular Elder Scrolls or fallout then sure, who cares if you have 5000 cheese wheels, it's your solo, personal gameplay that you are (imo) ruining. However, on an online multiplayer game where you doing said glitch results in crashing entire servers and ruining countless of other peoples gameplay, frustrating some people to the point that they quit playing, then it's a fucking issue. I'm sure theres some sort of TOS you entered into simply by buying the game and logging in. I'd love for them to just fix it by snapping their fingers but if it cant be that fast take a stand against it immediately and start banning. It's not an exploit at this point, its digital social disruption. Its steals money from me everytime I cant find a server worth playing because some fuckhead wants to waste hours making 3000 boards. 
---
Just don't ask for head. 
---
&gt; 2 tricks: It's often easier to retake a shop than defend it. Smaller horde, 1 wave, concentrated spawn.
---
It's funny because one time I did that and my turrets were still up and they actually solved the "take back" for me. Lazy damn turrets, refuse to work unless I'm actually there watching them.
---
There are several posts where people timed AP recovery with one and/or the other.  The numbers I saw where like 14 seconds full recovery, 12 with lone wanderer, 12 with action boy and 11 with them both, or close to that.  The tool tips show they could possibly stack but the math shows they multiply which means you get 30% of 30% or effectively 10% from the second card or minimal action points.  It’s not the 60% you hope it would add up to be.  3 freed up points for covert agent in agility.
---
Lone wanderer is good solo but wasted when grouped so I swap action boy in when grouped to keep AP regen up and use something besides lone wanderer in the charisma slot.
---
Ignore all the min/maxers.  I run several auto and non auto rifles and swap out the str cards depending on what I am doing without the need for 700 dmg crit shots. 
---
Sneak rifles can have insane dmg but it’s all vats.  Commando/semi auto builds are just as viable end game as shotguns, not as powerful but also not as reliant on gear.  It also feels more like an FPS when I play in first person with a semi auto.
---
It does think about how much more badass you would feel if those tse  weapons were actually rare and you had one. I do not currently have any.  But if I did I wouldn't feel good about because dupers are flooding the game with them...think about it 
---
How do u even check nuke silo times?
---
I think there should be a (bodyguard) job in game
---
A player may ask to hair you to keep him safe and u get paid with some caps and stimpaks and 1 atom
---
After u leave party and they can rate your service
---
And for that you gain reputation the list of possibilities is endless. 
---
I got buddies I run with 25/8 so ranged isn't a problem for me, plus when it comes to scorch queen, I can take care of the extra ads, while they focus on her.
---
More likely its one of the very few things you can actually customize at your CAMP instead of just picking a different preset variety of light or wall/floor texture.
---
There are other games with much better customization, but because they're designed better they don't need to make them cost a fortune.
---
you kinda wish you were joking huh? you bet you do, it doesnt mean it's duped. thanks to other helpful users I know that it means "two shot explosive" and besides, I've gotten TSE's before without duping, thanks very much, for not being helpful. /s
---
A golf outfit is worth more than a lot of them. Some jerk tags a mob and gets a 2 shot explosive. What an achievement. Some other guy grinds for months and gets 500 autostim wooden legs. Does feeling "special" make up for poor game design? Does wasting 100 hours of your life killing the same glowing ghouls in Whistespring make you feel special? Even the best loot is close to trash. Because we see it over and over with this effect or that effect. It's all the same. And explosive weapons are just obnoxious and no fun to use or have used against you. But some jerk finds one of those weapons and with the right build can just steamroll any workshop. Everyone else just has to accept and respect his specialness and good fortune, while they endlessly grind for some equalizer.
---
Was at my camp and two guys over level 140 came and destroyed my entire camp in seconds with assault rifles around midnight. 0/10 would recommend again.
---
and yet they give me orbital strike beacons, Officer's uniform and prototype armour. It's only a matter of time until someone wonders when the responders got so hardcore.
---
A magical bug appears that disabled ALL OF THE SERVERS even after the servers are rebooted?  
---
Lies.  
---
Explosive damage can be mitigated with sentinel armor. With a melee build you can just sit there till they get close and vat tele one shot them. I agree though, pvp needs alot of balance work
---
silo status holotape
---
For all the many things it did wrong, Archeage included this feature and it kept the newbie areas (which are dotted along the entire map) well populated at all times. As long as there were new people playing, there were higher levels mixed in and it made the war mechanics more interesting. 
---
Not really, because the game itself has barely changed. Fixing game breaking bugs doesn't make the game better, it makes it what it was supposed to be. Respec was a nice addition, but that and a few balance changes is all that's really changed gameplay wise.
---
Hopefully it'll start getting better when they add new things. 
---
I don't know how else to explain it ...but games like this are about the grind a and being rewarded for time spent...

---
Holotape purchased from enclave armoury vendor
---
Wow you have to buy it? Lol
---
Bethesda should just make it were TSE didn't benefit from perk cards. Example would be Demolition Expert, and that weapons corresponding damage perk cards. Have the explosive bonus be a flat rate number or a percentage of the weapons damage, and have the second shot only do the weapons base damage or maybe a percentage also. I feel like most people hate the duping because it spreads TSE weapons that make this game look like a joke.

Few people who know them? Just about everyone knows them. They are everywhere telling people how to do it. Yes, bethesda needs to fix it, if they cant immediately fix it, then take some other sort of immediate action. 
---
A day is a surprisingly long time to you?
---
You get one through the enclave quests. The one they sell is replacement incase you lose yours.

Heh!

You're right. It's a giant conspiracy to stop people from completing the game, thereby making all kinds of profit because Bethesda is evil.

BOS is a mod of combat armor and wouldn't show in there. There is supposed to be heavy combat plans but I have never seen them in 300+ hours. So check under light category and craft light combat with BOS mod.

The only commonish heavy plan types are Robot and Leather. Alot of people confuse mods with base armor, not saying you are but that is the most common reason.

Dense armor mods help greatly at reducing explosive damage.

If the turrets get the kill Noone gets the xp or the loot. Alot of people don't like when people do this, it's the equivalent of someone walking up and taking all the kills with a Tse and just looking at you like it's no big deal. If you have it setup to where people can tag them and not right next to the front door it will work well. I'm all for it if it's organized. I'll add you and probably hop on in a couple hours for some good loot. 
---
At least you have that stuff. The metal garage door stays open any time it’s powered and doesn’t have a switch anywhere. You have to find a plan for a switch and add it
---
Yes.
---
That's probably what I've been doing. Seems kinda weird though that they'd list it under lite armor and require a mod, instead of its own category. Seems a little misleading

It's just screwy like that. Happens a lot. 
---
How are people accumulating so many caps with the 200/day vendor limit?
---
That's completely true. Software can cause a BSOD, software could be Microsoft Excel, a GPU driver or even a game.
---
This is really becoming absolutely outrageous. It is truly enraging, several times over past few days (last days of my christmas break...) I've spent 30-40mins meticulously clearing a location only to randomly DC like 75% of the way through. It's simply unacceptable for this to be happening so regularly, I actually really enjoy the game but this is infuriating :(
---
It's still tied to the frame rate. The only difference is that the physics calculation takes the frame rate into account instead of assuming it's a hard number.
---
If you find the plan use the pressure plate to open it temporary or the keypad switch to open it and it'll close after a bit
---
Vendor Bot Wallace. I love his *SOOTHING VOICE*
---
The game is good. Ppl don't come to reddit to talk good about games.
---
And YouTube thrives on negativity.
---
Btw this game will never get the ff14 treatment as it didn't fail miserably in the sales department.
---
OPs title isn’t childish. It’s something that should’ve been resolved long before the beta, or at least during it. The game isn’t even close to being complete. 
---
I wouldn't say the economy is affected much since the cap limits per character, vendor and player trading. It would've been worse if there wasn't any limitation to caps. The thing I wish they would implement is a chat so we can effectually join groups and promote trading.
---
100% agree with you.  I got to level 95 when I called it quits,  I felt I was just logging in to wander around and not really accomplish anything. 
---
I really wanted to like this game longer, but there isn't any real replay value in the end-game.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Bethesda stores all their game data in BA2s.  
---
So instead of sending you specific files they just send an entirely new BA2 to replace the old one.  
---
It's not a lot of new content they're sending you.  That's why their updates seem massive, but they're really not.  
---
Perks are only applied when you equip the weapon not put in your bag.
---
Of course. They are the core demographic for alot of games.
---
I saw her probably my 3rd try but no plans...guess I'll just have to keep trying

Yeah welcome to Bethesda Game Studio's exciting new multiplayer game.
---
I really haven't played a multiplayer game with zero text chat in... I don't even know the last PC multiplayer game that didn't have it because its mandatory. But people on this subreddit will tell you "just get a mic!" because Bethesda is great.
---
Thanks, I'll check that vendor out! 
---
There's been a ton of "confirmed" Bethesda knowledge that legitimately starts as someone just guessing. Then that guess is repeated as what people are hearing. Then that gets repeated as fact. It's the internet version of the telephone game.
---
&gt;  just to not keep making them without the game changing enough to warrant another one
---
What about those lots of improvements you were banging on about?
---
&gt; I gave them 6 months to fix the bugs and balances which is a reasonable amount for the problems they have.
---
And the amount of problems is not reasonable. 
---
I..... I can't believe I never considered that. I feel rather simple now.
---
Thanks for the idea.

This all day this they should have to work for said guns and if they did good on them but if they duped or bought a dupe that's basically what my post is about

I stopped doing doing the messanger quests because about 60% of them bugged out and didnt work.
---
You're assuming a lot of confidence for people who made Item selection menus use array indexes instead of the unique identifier of the item.
---
They also closed some of the fissure sights. Probably someone found an exploit or they are adding some new content... It's been two days. There's more to the game than nuking whitesprings.

Damn well glad the scrap passives aren’t the reason I put anything in my int, got it mid range 7-8 for the perks that I mostly swap in and out, at least it helps a bit with hacking cause that totally needed to be easier /s

BoS fatigues or Military Fatigues?   
---
Both are fatigues but fall in two different under amor categories.   
---
The MILITARY fatigues are part of the casual line.

The BoS fatigues are part of the BoS line, along with the Soldier, Knight and Officer under armors.

---
You sure that isnt the small letters plan?
---
It's 1G and they haven't done that since the second update and that was for an overhaul (unnecessary but it is what it is). Are you done being a troll because Noone here wants to hear this. Go talk to r/fallout if you want to complain. Remember Cod has 30gig updates for new weapon skins.. Read their actual website and hotfix/patch notes instead of losing your mind.

Your character should automatically know them. They just don't show up until you put your CAMP on a spot that has a resource.
---
If nothing else, capture a Workshop once and your character will have all those plans unlocked.

I disagree. I think it's a smidgen bigger not a tad.

Been there. Store turrets that have turned against you and you can replace them later. Set the fast travel point inside so you don't down out there with the beasts. You'll have to sneak out on your own, tho. I wish you the best of luck.

I had a problem with losing all my circuits due to dying and disconnecting, it had taken me ages to farm them and I knew better than to carry them but it happened. I asked if anyone on the discord server had circuits and a random guy drops a stack of 500 of them for me like it's nothing and asks for nothing in return.
---
I didn't feel better, I felt worse. All my farming from that point on wasn't fun. Why farm anything when everyone around you is using duplicated items and unlimited carry glitches? 
---
What he said. Basically one click against any player when you have stacked perks and they die regardless of their defense or perks. Makes pvp pointless.
---
Correct, items found in a static location have a timer, items at vendors do not.
---
Thanks! I guess I need to move my camp.

Ive seen others, but they are super rare.

Well scorched are afflicted by a disease and super mutants are afflicted by a virus.

We need more people sticking up for terrible games, as op pointed out there are only a few left and he needs backup.
---
Maybe because people are on different time zones? I'm in Australia we had it 18 hours before some states in the USA 
---
Everyone is a raider to someone.
---
I truly do not understand why you care one way or the other. 
---
Their duplicates cannot *possibly* affect your game. 
---
Y2k they never fixed it in the engine. 
---
Yes and no. They seem to want to control inflation as evidenced by the harsh cap limit and the lack of replenishment of caps after you purchase items. Essentially they are taking caps out of the system to curb inflation. 
---
[Like this?](https://imgur.com/gallery/gdNXdJM) 
---
The best way to handle this is to fix all possible ways of duping and just make lvl 50s obsolete. That can be done by increasing the cap of weapons and armor to higher than 50
---
Ah sorry, did not update this post.
---
No, have not done anything to get banned (to my knowledge). 
---
I did check my quarantine in AVG and the exe was there. So, after both reinstalling the game and making it an exception in AVG, I was able to play again. :)
---
Can you send the link for the discord
---
Look. Mole Miners know all about combat shotguns savvy?
---
Go ask them.
---
That's also super cute. You kids should make a band.
---
I don't feel like having that on the Hud would be very good, it makes sense that Pip-Boys would be connected somehow so I just went from there
---
After everyones comments, it is clear that Bethesda should stick to single player games, or everyone should stick to groups or solo player. Too many multiplayer issues that they can’t resolve. I don’t care if someone has 1mil caps and thousands of dupes, good for them. I have 1500 caps and shitty weapons and Im okay with that. Ima just play the game and get what I earn. 
---
I've seen quite a few in just plain civilian clothing, as well.
---
Honestly, though, that's like asking why so many raiders in the Commonwealth used an excessive number of belts in their outfits...
---
It would be nice if lots of things in this game did something.
---
I love finding vaults and knowing the only thing i'm going to find inside is a computer
---
Is there a limit?  Check your photo gallery.  It may be filled up.
---
I thought they mostly shared 1-2 pools: the train and Responder vendors are the only two I found so far. Will keep looking thanks
---
I don't think it's a capacity problem. I've only taken around 5 photos.
---
Oh you're right, it is.
---
I would not. Not everyone has the time to just start again. Not when there are plenty of of other viable options. A wipe would be lazy as heck. 
---
Was your camp an armor bench next to a cooler with no doors? And did you leave a trail of paper bags?
---
Not really
---
Nah it's not. You don't get the point at all. Legendaries are not special. They are common. People are throwing them away in the 10s in brown paper bags that despawn into the ether. They have no value, even before duping. You want to feel special. Most people just want a good loot system where they can reliably get what they want and be on an equal playing field, as opposed to being outgunned by little Tommy who tagged a mob in a hazmat suit at level 35 and found an explosive two shot weapon that lets him now bully noobs through sheer luck. But as long as you feel special eventually *maybe* getting it after a few hundred hours it's all good. What's the difference between spending caps and real money. What the difference is it was duped or if it dropped? No difference. Some games even use that model to intentionally sucker people into spending real money. Maybe some games had that in mind, but with the current climate against pay to win and microtransactions they have to tread very carefully these days.
---
bethesda has already dropped this game guys
---
there isn't going to be any more updates.
---
its just gonna keep being random re balances and community teams commenting on posts saying "we're gonna look into this thank you!"
---
the game is dead
---
Yeah, you're right. The cooler in the picture is in grave danger of persecution.
---
Ah. That explains it. You play with children.
---
I had thought of that. I first logged in with a good 2 hours before NYC would drop the ball, though. And it's not like there was a shortage of players. It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say I encountered at least a hundred players. Oh well. I'll be sure to temper my expectations next time I go out and try to make friends.
---
This just about sums it up for everything OP missed from game start on to now. Great work!
---
Why do we get holidays but they don’t? This is what happens when companies release game’s during a holiday period. If things go wrong we have to wait weeks before things are fully up and running again.
---
Be patient.
---
Hopefully they implement this right. I always thought a game wide auction house may be the easiest solution but who knows this could work as well. It works in ESO.
---
Just fix the dupe glitch so it cannot be done again and let the players continue as they were.  It was in the game and still is, that is on B rather than the players.  Eventually the stock will dry up on the market and TSE’s can go back to being sold for 25,000 each. 
---
I still trade a fair bit of non TSE stuff and there is a market for things other than those weapons for sure. 
---
If your trying to sell a TSE your better off just sitting on it till the market makes them stupid expensive again. 
---
Lmao. Hahaha Every two shot explosive is duped. There was only one in the game ever and that one person duped it 10000 times and passed it on to others. He is god in fallout.  
---
That’s what I’ve gotten from this sub so far 
---
I got disconnected three times as well. Finally skipped to the last uplink since I disconnected right at it, and it updated the quest. Pain in the neck honestly, it should properly checkpoint after each uplink at the least. 
---
I assumed because someone on the art team was a Final Fantasy fan.
---
I think you should just use a modded shotgun, i have a level 15 shotgun with a hardened reciever and no perks that boost damage and it deals 81 damage which obliterates most of the things im finding my level
---
Why without compensation? How do you know what items in your inventory are duped or not?
---
Honest question. I know I've used more purified water than I've ever picked up. I know my stimpacks glitched when I traded with a team mate.
---
Poor mechanics are not a reason to punish player base. 
---
Ok, this isn't really about any issues, just general feedback. I'm playing on Xbox One, gamertag nyl0C666. But what's up with the forehead tattoos in the atom shop? I love the idea of tattoos, I have many IRL. But why do they have to be on the forehead? Or cheek?Who gets a tattoo on their forehead? Maybe some punks and serious full-body tattoo peeps, but the average person doesn't go there, especially someone with only one tattoo...they prob wouldn't get that first one THERE. Why can't we choose from some basic locations as in previous games? I got the only one that is in a sensible place - the eagle. It looks great! But forehead, cheek, I just really don't get that. They look tremendously stupid IMHO. I'd love to see more options and some that look like legit tats, like the Misfit Ink mod on FO4...that was awesome! Ok like I said, nothing earth-shaking here, just some superficial/superfluous feedback/suggestions. Enjoying the game for the most part, in spite of challenging issues. Once they change the servers so I don't have to get murdered ever other session by tactless/mutant losers 20 levels above me with some kind of major insecurities or Napoleon complex IRL who obv have nothing more stimulating to do (bc the game has no real story), it'll be a lot better. PLEASE do that, soon! Thx!! =) 
---
Same thing with the escort one near VTU. He was on his way back then a couple of VBirds flew in and SQUIRREL
---
It’s my left leg on my ultracite 
---
Why not just use tomahawk or knives for ranged weapon? They are silent, gain damage boost from mutations and are cheap to make.
---
What they could do it have all the player vendor items listed on the pipe boy so that they could be purchase while you are offline. 
---
Yep. It wouldn’t surprise me to learn that most of the people on the server aren’t old enough to be on the game. 
---
I have the plan but I honestly can't remember where or when I got it.
---
And to do that they need to punish other players that don't actually affect their playstyle?
---
Yup.  Wendigos will pounce on you faster than a a snow cone melting in Hell 
---

I think having text chat hidden away in what is essentially a fancy menu would be counter intuitive and bad design. 
---
A lot of people have this issue. Cant do anything but wait.
---
Sorry when I work on projects in my creative industry I miss plenty of holidays and weekends.
---
Besides Christmas and New Years are now over and this hasn't stopped being a $60 game that is already in the bargain bin.
---
haha awesome
---
If you go to the console and repair everything it will repair some anti air defenses. I only took that workshop for the first time yesterday. I was confused what is taking up a quarter of the budget. Then I noticed the vertibird and anti air defenses.
---
I have only ran into one at a time. I wish they were more common.
---
Haha. Trust me, I know all about mole miners. At level 15 I explored about 80% of the sw of the map and believe me. There where many mole miners. Even ones with missile launchers!
---
Thanks!
---
Which is sad. I'd like this game to be around for a while, but I don't see that happening. :(
---
9k, 9,000k == 9,000,000.  TBH, your price is probably a better idea :p
---
It sounds dark, but in my emerision, when I come across open graves, I can't help but think, better them, than me.
---
..ask yourself, who would you rather be? The person launching the nuke, or the person receiving the nuke..
---
It’s all the same. Just the DR and condition change with level  
---
I mean, I'm sure at least a couple of those are load-bearing belts, but how would you know which ones? 
---
I've got about 30 of em in storage. If you find the answer let me know. They take up a portion of my budget.
---
It's the exit from the launch room of silo. Once you got up you can't get back in. 
---
Why without compensation? Because I don't think the dupers should be rewarded.
---
If a bug gave you extra, and then you lose that extra, you aren't being punished.
---
1200 caps per day from all the vendors combined. it's earned pretty quick
---
I usually just smash the button until I can't anymore. This way I don't notice the lag.
---
Ok, i figured thats how it was. I assume the timer is 24 hours? Does this also apply to power armor?
---
I'm kind of leery of helping lower levels too much - I feel that it might water down the experience somewhat if they're given a higher level crutch helping them out constantly.  You can't begin to imagine the real terror I had with my first Scorchbeast encounter.
---
Handmade rifle, the AK-looking gun. It's the most well-rounded gun in the game and easily has one of the highest DPS. That along with shotguns are the most powerful and most popular two shot explosives out there
---
Happened once. Hasn't happened again luckily. 
---
“In your creative industry”. Of course. But what you’re waiting on is the QA team, which, besides a skeleton crew, would not be working the holidays.
---
As you said, “the holidays are over”, and they’ve given an update on the patch already. 
---
Be patient, or don’t.
---
I just wish I could remember the guy who did it. 
---
That's because they NEVER fixed duping. It's the SAME dupe as before. First time they fixed it they made it so you couldn't place thing in artillery crate (so instead they just use world crates). Second time they fixed it they made it so you can't craft 300 of an item I guess (which is what made servers unstable and caused roll-back), now dupers just craft 250 of an item to make server unstable.
---
leather for ER. metal for DR. bos combat for best hybrid
---
Everyone seems to lol
---
Being that the compass shows coords why not plot it yourself? Wouldn't take much as once you figure the spacing for a few the rest is easy to map.
---
Thought I was gonna hang out at white springs with new friends and strangers and watch the silos launch a fireworks show.
---
All I got was an empty server time after time, and nothing but the normal, boring, beautiful night sky. 
---
I think people actually want to verify that your sources are legit. Not that you "have sources ". So saying "use Google " is a cheap cop out. I can google "vaccines cause autism " and in 5 seconds get a "source" that says vaccines cause autism.  That doesn't mean the source is legit. It's just some dumb asshole spreading rumors as facts.
---
You think a 24 hour major content outage is acceptable?
---
Is this nuke bug only on PC?
---
Well, they're not dead.  I really hoped to see a bit more from Bethesda this week.
---
Almost everyone I know worked between xmas and new years, and they didn't release a critically panned buggy mess that's tarnishing a franchise further with every passing moment. 
---
All I get out of it is probably ruining someone’s play session which is enough lol
---
Build BlackBerry plants around the torrent to keep enemies from destroying turrents quickly 
---
That’s the same as asking for free points to allocate to luck. You don’t need a card for it just amp up your luck. 
---
No fuck Bethesda for releasing a shit house game dependent on servers "you won't even see" and not supporting their fully priced game they spent millions on marketing.
---
Speak of the devil my game just crashed again.
---
It's universal as far as I can tell. 
---
But my point is that nobody has yet reported those bigger issues getting fixed for them, by customer support or bethesda or anybody else. If those tools exist but those who have them do not use them, that's as good as not having them. Feel free to prove me wrong if people have had these issues fixed and I just never saw any posts about it though, but given the state of the sub and the general outlook on this I'd assume it would get to FP quickly
---
No nukes/silos/fissure prime are all screwed currently.
---
What kinds of things? What they are talking about, player vendors, was announced. Fortnite showed the world that you can make plenty of money off skins.
---
I'm in the same boat, it's installed on my PS4 but I've yet to start it up...I was relieved to read this post, it leaves me a little more hopeful than I was prior.
---
Smh so the game is just useless right now? Battlefield it is then
---
I don't think being disconnected from servers is ever going to get fixed.
---
&gt;hin
---
Exactly. What if this was the new server installed at the power plant/airport/hospital? "TOO BAD GRANDMAS LIFE SUPPORT MACHINE IS CRASHING EVERY 10 MINUTES, OUR 24/7 SUPPORT STAFF ARE ON HOLIDAYS!"
---
Yeah but I didnt mean for it to be duping exclusive, mb there.
---
It's more like 
---
&gt;patches missing text in game somewhere
---
&gt;now everybody can fly because theres a flying glitch and infinite health and you've become the scorchbeast queen
---
I know how the duping works, my use of the word fixed is very light. It should be 'fixed' duping lol
---
O god you were using the pump? RIP my dude 😫
---
Was wondering how much water you made in 30 minutes haha
---
It isn't just pvp though. Level 112 with slugger 1 rocking All Rise. Not enough damage to fully one shot enemies but close. I could add Incisor maybe but I try to be fair and let others get a hit in to be able to pick up stuff. Others don't. 
---
Tried doing the uranium rush and some level 30 ass hat kept jumping in front of me one shotting ALL the legendary management. Bull shit. They didn't even bother repairing the collectors or killing the other enemies. 
---
Tried again after server hopping. Some guy with a double shot explosive shotgun did the same exact thing.
---
This needs balancing or even removal. Sick and tired of going into nuke zones and seeing others doing the exact same thing. 
---
So the jack of all trades armour would be the unholy combination of excavator arms, t60 legs, and T51/X01 torso and helmet?
---
Excavator with calibrated shocks are bloody amazing as fast travel devices.
---
Have you hit the storage cap for the machine?  It can only hold so many munitions before it stops producing more.  
---
it is partially right, partially not.
---
That's different. 
---
Nukes are not a major piece of content.
---
It is unfortunate that end game is a single task but its still just one thing not working.
---
Also its being fixed faster than every bug that has been patched.
---
Its more important to fix that then duping.
---
Well, I'm glad that at least someone else can corroborate my claim. I've been enjoying this game for quite a while now and this feels like a punch in the gut, at least for the moment, especially since I don't really have a good ranged weapon to use now.
---
I don't think it will either. I'm pretty confident by the time new content starts rolling out these issues will still be regularly happening.
---
I and 2 others ran into both with a lvl 50 scorchbeast. We saw the SB 1st, went in for the kill and MM showed up, FLM showed up behind from nowhere. FLM made everything on the Damn screen purple, the SB with their antics and MM doing his thing made the frame rate lag and it was a total shit show for about 15 minutes. This was by the pumpkin farm in the north part of map. Craziest moment in the game for me so far, was fun as hell though.
---
Yup reread that one too. It's a daily so you'd think you could repeat it. 
---
What, you're surprised that the people exploiting a game are also trying to sell you duped items?  
---
It's completely empty. 
---
I reckon the best way to deal with it, since they can’t just delete the items from the game, is raise the level cap to 55 or 60. Suddenly all the duped weapons aren’t the best anymore and will   phase out of the circulation after some time.
---
I don't go out of my way to jump in front of players at whitespring nuke. I warn them on the Mic to watch their aim. If the bounty pops up on my screen, I do turn around and kill said player.
---
Given the state of PvP, they usually seek revenge and TSE me. Now we go back and forth on the yard for shits.
---
At the point now where I farm legendaries and exp. I lose junk that might be acid or cloth.. never anything I need to hold onto, or that I've actively farmed.
---
So, that's the grass on the other side.
---
I'm not one to turn down a request either......
---

Dude, you're fucking annoying. The game literally has nothing to do it in except to "create your own fun" by RPing. I shouldn't have to create my own fun throughout the entire game. $60.
---
World of Fallout: Battle for West Virginia.
---
System? 
---
It'd be just as useless with nukes working because servers crash even more now.
---
What system? 
---
&gt;  water pump buildable item - just use rivers much faster.
---
Nah. Once you know the trick, you can collect from them pretty fast. First, drink from it. Second, while the animation is still running, spam Collect as fast as you want. I can easily get a dozen dirty water collected in one go.
---
This is true. 
---
I'm past 80 hours in and while I've seen the Mothman several times, I've only come across the Flatwoods Monster once.
---
Calling tards tards is easy yes.
---
I am not upset currently but yes, basically telling me I've wasted my life by literally wiping out the progress I have because some people used an in game mechanic? Yeah I'll be upset.
---
The people clamoring for the wipe must have nothing better to do with their lives besides repeat things they have done before. Some of us do. 
---
Made 120 boiled water. 240 dirty

If you're on Xbox I'll run ya through it

GT is PartRenob just hmu if you ever need help
---
1. I have already told a lot of improvements were made just not enough compared to what is left. Due to the sheer amount of bugs and balances that need to be made it will take a while to be fixed. I don't understand why you keep making that point when I keep telling you that there is a lot left to fix.
---
2. I never said it was. I am just tired of articles and videos keep mentioning it when they already have for free content.
---
Sidenote: You obviously understand my point but just want to be right you bring up everything but my point. I never said they made the perfect game. I never said that people can't criticize it. I never said that amount of bugs is reasonable. I have a problem with it being circle jerked. You think that me telling you that media and articles are circle jerking it for views is defending the games for eveything. Your two statements even counterdict each other showing me that you are trying to do everything to be right. You qoute me saying that media should let the game change enough before talking about it again and then say that I said they have fixed a lot of bugs implying that its time for it to be covered again. Then you proceed to go onto quote me saying it will be a while to fix all the bugs and then you say how it having a lot of bugs is unreasonable. So which story are you going with that a lot of improvements have been made so people can cover it again or that there is a lot of bugs still which means that not enough had changed to warrant another change?
---
But, I don't have friends :(
---
Pc!
---
Not the small letters set? This is for neon signs
---
Or people who just craft a lot of one item without duping. I play with my roommate and he constantly crafts civil war era suits because they sell for 25 caps a piece (valued at 100 caps) without any vendor perks. And cloth is freaking everywhere,  and gold is almost easy to find in small batches. And since clothes wrigh almost nothing, there is a good chance he is carrying about 30 civil war era suits in his inventory for the party to sell whenever we can find a vendor. It would suck for him to get reported for duping simply because he has a long list of an item he legitimately crafted.
---
(Ps. For those who don't know, find plans for civil war era suits. The things are a goddamn gold mine)
---
Pc
---
**Just figured out what the issue was:**
---
# Items were not displaying on the ui. Instead, they were hidden within the machine. You have to press "t" (transfer) to view what it's been making. 
---
I don't disagree with the message but crying "this sucks" is hardly a mature way to invite conversation. 
---
I paid full price and I have no regrets. The worth of it is subjective and doesn't hinge on how you feel about it. 
---
I'm not even gonna address the console thing. It's a weird and pointless argument. Even if it was "meant" for console, there are plenty of good ports from console to PC. They'll get there. 
---
Dupers. Don't support those guys, they're contributing to server instability.
---
[http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Citadel\_terminal\_entries#Vault\_76](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Citadel_terminal_entries#Vault_76) was referenced in terminals in the citadel too it seems. Nice find!
---
To be serious tho:
---
1. What PvE?
---
2. What PvP?
---
:( Xbox 
---
Wow. So theoretically they could’ve patched this into Skyrim or Fallout 4 or any previous gamebryo engine title?
---
I can confirm myself that Census Violence in the Cranberry Bog, drops both Protective and Shielded Marine.
---
I'd definitely give it a try! I went in expecting a Fallout MMO, and that's exactly what it is. Expecting anything more is foolish

Seriously, how the fuck is Uranium Fever not on the songlist?

Why are you so angry lol

I had a level 263 today try to troll me. He came to my camo (which is very secluded) and tried to blow it up with a mini nuke mirv. I say tried, because he only blew himself up. I heard a boom, walked outside and saw his level 263 self sitting on the ground, did the heart emoji, and left the server. He didn't even damage any of my crops
---
Getting downvoted for stating completely accurate information.
---
Nukes/silos/fissure prime are all currently broken. Bethesda has even acknowledged this.
---
Oh...no lol.
---
I boxed that in and lived in it
---
I have rank 3 and I've never seen it proc and I always have to repair my weapons.
---
While me and my my circle of friends managed to combine to farm enough resources to trade duper’s for a bunch of stuff, it seems like the ones we have used in the past to trade with seem to do it just to say they have everything.  Kinda like acting like a Merovingian from the Matrix or something.
---
Even though we did trade for duped items we still to this day farm out the ass to try to earn the fabled TSE’s and epic armors... personally I’m still coming up empty handed in all my efforts farming but hope Bethesda fixes the apparent issues with Luck working with any consistency the higher your luck is.  Or I just have beyond megaton shitty RNG roughly 270 levels into the game now...
---
While its soul crushing I do have my favorite items thanks to those undesirables so I keep my sanity playing this game and enjoying it lol.  
---
Yeah but consider the build points you'd need. These aren't bad tips at all. But the fact that you have to build a specific build around just winning pvp makes it broken in a game where pvp is such a minor part.
---
It would be different if you could swap out builds easily, but a good power armor build needs a ton of stats in strength and intelligence.
---
A high level player in PA should have at least some chance of a pvp win VS someone.
---
And realistically speaking, wouldn't the whole concept of combat power armor by very nature have good blast resist? It just seems incredibly unbalanced for power armor users which require a very specialized build. 
---
You must have a boring life for this game to be the pinnacle, seeing as you call it a mechanic you probably used the exploit yourself. Do whatever. Go head have my downvotes. 
---
The PC Tricentennial edition went on sale on Amazon(Canada) for CDN$29.99 right after X-mas and I grabbed a copy. Given what's included in the Tricentennial edition for the premium price I think sales must have been dismal. It was a physical copy that was mailed to me and it contained a paper disk with the key on it. 
---
Glad I've helped! Just don't go expecting Fallout 5, instead of an MMO, and you'll be fine
---
Almost all the way to the eastern end of the tunnel, there's a small base that has a weapons crafting station and a tinker's workbench. There's a folding chair due east of that workstation that has journal page 5 on it.
---
Adding this because I searched and searched and couldn't find the answer online. Found the page myself - sharing the wealth. :)
---
They should just have all the songs from all the games on the station. Big iron please. 
---
I love this game, but to be fair, it wasn't all a witch hunt. There were a lot of serious issues at launch that were addressed. It's still got issues but the new player experience now is going to be much smoother. 
---
Lol not surprised.. I've played enough games to know about RMT... just making a funny statement about it. 
---
That's...probably not very high on the priority list
---
I would be over there in a heartbeat but that's a no go on me sir. 
---
Make sure you're looking in the game's photo gallery not the console gallery? I make that mistake all the time when I want to go back and look at my photos.
---
Imagine that... a company selling in-game items using its marketing budget to buy advertising/endorsements from people that cover games which their websites also cover!
---
Not everything is a giant behind the scenes scam operation. Bethesda released a shit game and people run around taking advantage of it.
---
Higher resistances is the only difference.
---
Aw thanks for checking though!
---
I use Pipe Rifles exclusively for regular gameplay (SBQ I use different gear/weapons). Pipe Guns can be crafted to take advantage of Both Rifle and Pistol Perk Cards and my Main go-to is a Hardened Suppressed Pipe Revolver-Rifle that does 121 dps per shot and then starts scaling up with Adrenaline, Tenderizer, and Bloody Mess. 
---
Go to the train station in charleston, stand outside the door next to the station vendor, look right - you'll see red bridge with a power pole leaning against it.  Go to the bridge and walk just past the power pole then turn around and head back.  On your right is a small building (just across from the station).  Head towards the left side of that building and something should have spawned - if you're lucky you will see a pack brahmin and the vender bot, if not you may run into a pack of ghouls or super mutants, or possibly an eyebot playing music and leading a pack of radrats.  If the vendor didn't spawn you can log out and back into the server and try again using the steps above.  Good luck
---
My friend has killed one at the time he was a level 5
---
I think waiting until now has definitely made things better for me as a new player. I haven't experienced any bugs myself, so I fortunately can't speak for any of those issues
---
But just to be extraordinarily clear, your living consisted of more than an armor bench and paper bags? Your living included more than just banging out cheap items to force a disconnect?
---
Would your living there be horrendously affected by the removal of that cooler?
---
I know you can always find a water filter plan outside the Grafton station. 
---
So lame!
---
Was there any actual evidence for this? 
---
Yes, harpers ferry and the enclave bunker might have some

Yes you need to buy mod plans, don't remember where exactly I bought them but I have 3 mods for the wetsuit. 
---
Yep. There's even people selling duped items on eBay. Biggest seller I've seen was $44.88 and they've sold 12 last time I checked. I'm all for making money but I wouldn't be caught dead duplicating. Hopefully going to get a start on game flip soon. 
---
You're good to trade. No-one ever provided recorded evidence of the bug, last i checked a guy was experimenting with all the supposed methods and hasn't found anything yet.
---
Has anyone else gotten the complete boot? Most of the time the whole application crashes and sends me to a PS4 even to report the bug. 
---
he was probably bugged. It's an easy glitch to take no rads in nuke zones. Other than that nothing works except for having 9 charisma and sharing 3/3 rad sponge with 3-4 members, all who have to stay close to you. It's pretty horrific gameplay design. In fallout4 you could stack rad resist and it would be fine, sadly it doesn't work anymore and rad resist is pointless.
---
This was my first time seeing the Flatwoods Monster. I've found a Furious Mothman before though. I'm just disappointed I couldn't kill either of them this time. 
---
Items weren’t stolen, people were not paying attention to quantities and requested items. Hardly stealing if you agree to the trade
---
I'm at level 146, and ever since I reached 90 or so I've just been holding on to levels, as much as 13 at a time. Then I just suddenly decide "hey I want to go try out shotguns for a while" and max out every single shotgun perk for the hell of it. If we had more uses for perks it wouldn't take us such a short time to reach a point where everything is fancy as opposed to important for your build
---
All night long 
---
Got a T-45 Jetpack mod last night also.
---
Try both Watoga vendors and the Harper's Ferry vendor. I used to visit them a lot. 
---
*back in the day I was kinda d of a hacker* 
---
Cringe 
---
My last update was 4.2 GB if I recall correctly.  I haven’t seen one less than 1 GB, don’t know about you guys but I’m only sitting on a 40 Mbps bonded DSL (max in my area) and it is not pleasant but tolerated to play this game I enjoy.  
---
Looking forward to seeing how big this hot fix is gonna be.
---
Yeah, had a large stash of atoms and since I dont use PA I opted for those outfits.  I think the duster looks better with a military beret then the cowboy hat.
---
That was fake news. 
---
If you're crashing/dcing that often bethesda can't help you.
---
If you're using hyperbole then bethesda can, and will, ignore you.
---
I've been playing a lot lately. You're crashing 30x more often and dcing 50x more often than i do.
---
Yeah I played survival, so fast travel wasn't a thing, so I just let every single one fail, unless I was already nearby, or wanted to go in that direction and used a vertibird. 
---
Open it and play. It’s not near as bad as a lot make it seem. It is buggy as shit but Bethesda has been patching the game consistently so in time they will be fixed. The most annoying thing to me is when the game crashes. The world and game play is spot on! The quest aren’t as bad as people have made it seem and they are also adding more quest.
---
I think I may have hopped into that server while looking for the wolf pack event on my alt.  Thought it was the weirdest place for a nuke, and thought someone was trying to troll the Christmas new guys doing quests in that area.
---
I have all 3 of my legendary weapons legitiment: Quad Guass Rifle, Instigating Tesla Rifle, Anti-Armor Machete. 2 from a Scorchbeast Queen Event and the Machete from a Putrid Glowing One at Whitespring.
---
I refuse to trade with anyone except for those are either part of the Brotherhood of Steel Discord group I'm in or Responders out in the field. 
---
Sometimes but VERY rarely I'll trade with civilians 
---
Very nice to see interaction between players and bethesda. Keep it up!
---
Whenever i die i start singing aint nobodies fault but mine
---
Play it!! I’m telling you if you enjoyed fallout 4 then there’s a good chance you like this one. 
---
&gt; Nukes are not a major piece of content.
---
Wow, ok.
---
Honestly, you aren't wrong. The reason you are being down voted (I assume) is because you have to be right next to the letters to even see them.
---
These are big ass letters that can be seen from considerably further away and they are neon blue.
---
Holy shit this changes everything. What do the substations and power hookups look like? Any pics?
---
Thank you!
---
Maybe driver issues?
---
probably never.  I expect this quality is their new normal.
---
Hey!  Maybe we won!   Nope, just glitched
---
I agree this is my ideal situation, though there would be a long balance time of Dupers wrecking prices unless they implement fixes beforehand 
---
I've never seen an explosive weapon also be explosive. Two shot yes. 
---
“... AND LOTS OF WAVY HAIR LIKE LlBERACE!”
---
In that case they better make the alien blaster actually viable in the future
---
Two shot explosive flamer sounds like a gun gifted from the gods.
---
So as far as you are concerned new reviews should wait for a big change before being released. And that 'big change' is arbitrary but larger than 'lots of improvements'. You just seem to have a random set of criteria in your head for this, after big changes, but not this big change because it isn't big enough. After the 6 month big change which is appropriate because they released with loads of bugs so it takes loads of time to fix.
---
Hot take. Release 6 months later with less bugs after a proper QA cycle and you don't get a bunch of reviews repeating how your game is shit.
---
Yes, the widespread posts on here and twitter are because every person, even console users, is at fault and Bethesda released a perfectly working product.
---
He is saying the same thing bruh
---
Yea I kind of wish they would just get rid of the animations for crafting and such or at least have the opinion to turn them off. 
---
We have also checked drivers. They are up to date, and like I've said, our mics work nominally for every other game and application. Thanks, though.
---
I think it may be possible to farm the Casual Linings, in the Forest and Ash areas, it may seem to be related to the Responders ppl.  Just like how Marine is in the Cranberry, it may be that the Casual linings may drop in the ASH and FOREST areas.  Please lets continue our search, I have been doing all the low level events to confirm.  It would be nice to see others join in over time.... to complete this list.
---
I want to try hanging out high up in watoga; if you sneak when wanted do you disappear from their map? And does chameleon hide your gamer tag above your head so they actually have to work to spot you? 
---
Very much need this!
---
I suggest this song. Steve Earle - is a The Mountain.
---
https://youtu.be/P9K8b211MJw
---
I don't use a mic on this game but you could try adjusting the sampling rate (google it) for your microphone.
---
Also make sure you've selected the microphone as the default communication device in windows.
---
Zap zap zap zap *crack*
---
There are 3 boxes at Poseidon actually. I'm saying that even with the plants repaired, it doesn't always give you the 100 power or whatever higher number it is supposed to, and it doesn't always give the higher output to the nearby facilities it is supposed to power. 
---
Then either... Your mic has a loose wire or something... Settings on the computer need changed or your cursed.
---
Idk man, gl
---
So auto when in a team put you in team but you can hear area. 
---
Team puts you in team only 
---
Area puts you in area only
---
If you press V you can see the mic icon next to your character if your mic is qued. 
---
I had someone unable to hear me before and reloading did fix it. Hope this helps you further diagnose at the very least.
---
Going on 2 months now... Wondering when some of you guys will finally realise what this product actually is and was intended to be?
---
Hyperbole aside, the game definitely seems less stable than it was previously. I get server disconnects 2-3 times over a ~4 hour period, and I'm seeing new bugs and errors that I never saw on my first character (played since first beta) popping up regularly on my current alt.
---
There are definitely problems with this game, and they are definitely not getting better. It's not the direction I was hoping to see this game moving toward.
---
Ah, I understand. Thanks for taking the time to explain.
---
I know im just being sarcastic and spicy :&gt;
---
Ah ok. I guess that secondary modifier only applies to non-explosive weapons then. Which makes sense lol.
---
There's literally a weight glitch with the Excavator armor right now
---
If it makes you feel better it tested this with a friend. Absolutely fake.
---
I’m lucky I bought it at launch even though it cost $60 because I’ve thoroughly enjoyed myself so far. I like how I can play for a few hours and accomplish stuff. It’s almost like a 3D diablo to me. I’m addicted to the loot!
---
So, no pun whatsoever, that’s exactly what I used until about L100. I carried the four 4 remaining pieces of excavator in my inventory and swapped them in via hotkey. I even wrote a post about it. 
---
I ran into one guy playing the enclave radio from fallout 3
---
Watch me Friday the 13th this.
---
Honestly it's harder to find a good non TSE. WAAAY harder. I've been looking for a bloody/50%crit shotgun (which can actually do insane dmg since shotties can perma crit) for weeks with not even 1 person remotely mentioning such a thing has ever dropped.
---
I look forward to finding one about 30 seconds before they take the server offline to nerf them in a patch. 
---
Thanks for doing this! 
---
Just curious, but why would a game be picky about microphone sampling rate when every other game takes the mic as is? Also, I've already double check that the correct mics are defaulted.
---
Who’s angry? I find this sort of thing hilarious. In truth, millennials are more a form of entertainment than organisms to be taken seriously lol 😉
---
I absolutely loved Fallout 4 lol, and I do enjoy a good number of MMO's out there. I guess I'm just hoping that it's better than all the hate it's been receiving so far. It's honestly a little nerve-wracking as I love Bethesda's work.
---
Good mix of the pop and Western feeling of the new Vegas radio
---
There is no mic icon in third person mode, and we've tried all in menu options.
---
Im level 325. I play most of the day everyday. I have thousands upon thousands of ammo, to the point i have to always use Bandolier perk. I also use 8 different weapons, but my gear has 80% weapon weight reduction on it.
---
I play totally solo. I dont have friends. I do have a full time job that im currently on injury leave from. So all I can do really is play fallout 76. 
---
My daily routine involves selling to vendors each morning when i get up, then quickly running whitesprings with my mr handy buzz blade. Then clear out watoga and make my way north clearing out each major location all the way to dyer chemical. Doing any good/fast events on the way.
---
Wait so if your base is destroyed and you hop to a new server, it pops up good as new??
---
Uhm no
---
Not when the supply is almost infinite and inflation from exploits has already set in. Demand doesn't matter after inflation. Especially because caps aren't an actual regulated currency...... Ya know... Like real life.
---
Seriously, like... Please? I don't want to just drop this stuff. Let me love you. Let me give you things. I'm a nice lady. 
---
 I don't have a Combat shotgun plan. Its one a few I don't. 
---
  I have scrapped a lot and have knowledge about the mods. So I just picked up a level 45 one and made it mine. ;)
---
$60 game btw
---
Feels like an early alpha access game at best, poorly thought out, designed, and tested
---
since modders patched it into those games...
---
yes..  the creators of the actual game could have patched that in at any time.
---
they could have even given one of the modders $1000 and used their fix and not had to create anything.
---
but they never did.
---
The turtle done shat, wiped, finished his coffee and newspaper, got dressed and went to work by the time you're done reloading.  But I still love using mine as the first stealth crit against tougher critters - quickly switching to my HR.  I'll reload it later.
---
I wonder what would happen if you put the mirv launcher on it. Would it double the mirv shots or just add an extra one?
---
Honestly it wasn't as bad as it was made out to be but it was still pretty rough. I couldn't play for a couple of days because I was locked in power armor. Then I got out from a fix discovered by the community and the bug evolved and got me again lol. There have been some extremely frustrating moments. That being said, I'm still here because at its core this is a great game. I'm very excited to see where it goes. 
---
Stuff like the hysteria around this game is why I stopped giving a shit about online reviews and whatnot years and years ago. I've played a *lot* of MMO launches so I always go into a new online game expecting the worse. I won't lie, this one was one was up there with some of the worst but it's improving and that's what matters. 
---
Oh I've seen the quest line and it's awesome, it just doesn't satisfy me when it comes to the grinding halt of the main quest
---
Chances are the duplication people won't even use a market system if one is implemented.
---
They would all have so many of the items that they would drive prices into pocket change territory trying to sell their stock before the other person.
---
Happens a ton in games with player driven markets.
---
My legitimately acquired Gauss rifle is a tse and I kill myself with it allllllll the time
---
I have to disagree about melee being OP. I think that it definitely can feel that way in many cases however melee is useless unless you can get up close to someone and when you get there, you need to be able to do a lot of damage quickly. 
---
If anything, ranged damage in general needs a buff with automatics needing one again. Melee is actually viable in 76, which came as a surprise to me. I would hate to see it needed to hard to the point that it isn't worth using anymore. 
---
Because it might not support specific sample/bit rates because it was never programmed to support them.
---
I don't know if there's any way to see in game if the microphone actually works (as in purely to test audio levels and not relying on connecting to the server to see if your friend can hear you). If you can tell whether the game is receiving audio at all and it isn't working when actually playing it may be a networking/firewall issue (some games transmit voice separately or are filtered)
---
Nothing wrong with being a jerk, just don't go full jerk, you should never go full jerk. 
---
It also happens when inside buildings. 
---
I personally think a lot of it is the duping.
---
After seeing how it works and how it crashes players in a wide range i can't help but think that is reverberating more than ppl think.
---
The first day after the last patch i had superb performance but it didn't last long.
---
Hehe.. yeah watching them scatter. 
---
It'd cost your grandma more than a one time charge of $39.99. But bonus points for the extreme hyperbole.
---
Been playing on PC since beta, ive only heard 3 people talk in game and they were all adults.
---
Dangit!  The guy had just mastered levitation - and they had to go and ruin it for him.
---
That run, ammosmith and super duper put me at 900 shells. Ty again. 
---
Don't bases despawn when you log out though?
---
This isn't a discussion about casuals and hardcore gamers. It is a discussion about players and cheaters. For the sake of this dumb ass analogy and our disagreement, casuals are ma and pa shops, no lifers are corporations, and cheaters are the cartel
---
I'm lvl 169 can I still take all your stuff, I feel like a bully :( 
---
Through with the game but still plenty of salt for the forums
---
If you like Bethesda worlds they build then I believe you’ll enjoy the game. Its personally my favorite map of all their games. Obviously it’s not perfect and needs some improvements especially with stability but its not near as bad as some have made it seem from a gameplay standpoint. Plus you already have it installed so there’s not reason not to give it a shot. It’s definitely fallout. 
---
As an alternative I've been playing Scott Bradley &amp; Postmodern Jukebox radio on Pandora while I play. It is contemporary songs that are done in the style of 30s to 50s music. 
---
There's a simpler solution.
---
Blanket nerf the offenders and bring affixes into a comparable state.
---
Right now there is no comparison. 
---
Which resource would be the most important to farm?
---
Because
---
Honestly, as long as you put it to use or give it to your friends, and don't drop it, I don't care. I just don't want any of it to go to waste.
---
And there are 2 cap stash spawns outside as well as mods and plans. 
---
I will be on all day tomorrow and will gladly swing by if you still have things remaining!
---
There will never be a way to make even close to everyone happy but I like the idea of adding servers of different kinds. Player level range servers/pvp servers...even opening up the player amounts per server. As an Honest player I don’t think the cheaters have any rights whatsoever and should all be banned and the TSE weapons be nerfed and all duped legendaries etc be deleted. 
---
What Bethesda should do is leave about 50 current servers open for the duper players/current players and open up a new server block that everyone has a chance to start over with newer content weapons etc that way people who didn’t cheat can still play with their current characters but have the option to restart and get new content or they can continue playing their current characters and get new content on a later basis then people who start over. 
---
Problem is, everyone else is also getting rid of their items to open space, it's super annoying. 
---
What lvl are those items?
---
Shoot me a message, I'll let you know if I still have anything :)
---
A family died because of a nuclear war. Wow. What a story. never seen anything like it before in all my life.
---
Do this with your industrial water purifiers, as well. I've occasionally noticed they will "underproduce" until I transfer and five suddenly appear
---
Pop a radx diluted, spam collect from a water source, and you’ll never run out for soups and basic boiled water. 
---
Yeah, I wouldn't go chasing waterfalls.
---
That’s weird Cus I’m pretty sure I have a combat shotgun plan at lvl 24. I just had a huge clear out of my storage box cus it was getting full and got a few shotgun mods. 
---
I’m guessing you found that lvl 45 from a mole miner? If not then where about did you find it? 
---
I remember the early days of WoW when "endgame" was running the same five instances trying to get the correct gear to grind more instances
---
I joined a party last night and all they talked about was a couple of players they suspected of duping. I'm all for stopping exploiters, but rambling on and on about it for a half hour. It's like they felt it was their responsibility to bring justice to the dupers... I wanted to slap them and tell them to get over it and play the game, lol.
---
Will fallout get better anytime soon? Game is boring as all hell
---
Horde smart. Take note of what you use and sell everything else to the vendors or toss it.
---
I promise i'll only cripple his legs
---
Weapons and armor i scrap until i stop consistently learning mods (fun fact: you can craft and dismantle to learn new ones!)
---
Power armor, however, you have to buy the mods and mod plans for afaik
---
except hOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO EVEN START UP THE HACKING THING ON THE TERMINAL
---
Doubles mirv too
---
I constantly save level 40s from scorchbeast raves, then give them stuff after lmao so this could help. I'll join you!
---
Someone on the Fallout discord was selling them if you’re interested. 
---
I've never taken armor damage after death until now. If you watched the video, you would see that there were no "Xs" until I turned passive mode off (which is fine and understandable). The problem I have is that after I turned passive off and he took no damage at all. Maybe I'm missing something, but I'm pretty sure the gauss rifle is the strongest non-legendary rifle period... I had all rifle skills maxed and active. And he's only wearing excavator armor. Even if he found some crazy TSE overpowered weapon, he should have taken damage. At least a little. Never did his life bar even pop up. After he killed me the results showed he was level 0 (not saying that part isn't a server glitch though). Not saying rifles are the strongest or anything, but don't you at least agree that if I hit him, he should have lost at least 1 HP?
---
Thanks for the drama, but I'll pass.  Blocked.  
---
Guys all you gotta do is look at the size of your Fallout 76 folder.  
---
It's a shame you cant get a 2 shot furious then
---
Just drop it lol. I'm sitting here imagining you keeping every single round of ammunition and having like thousands of each.
---
Idk, I'm getting a little tired of enemies getting blown up with a tse before I can get a tag on them. It just trivializes any encounter when there is one of those around. 
---
Thanks!!! Workaround solved my Quest.
---
Anything above lvl 30 essentially. (I'm lvl 30 doing a melee build) I have a lvl 45 guitar sword, 35 shishkabob, the two shot is lvl 50, lvl 45 hazmat suit and a few armor pieces, aid, ammo, etc
---
Waste not want not man!
---
I’ve got a two shot MIRV and I’ve been trying to figure out if it does more damage that a reg two shot fat man or not?
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42982/kw/lost%20weapon
---
Also I have to give Bethesda credit for how many patches they put out so far. As long as they keep it coming then I think will eventually be amazing. As an MMO vet having tried a lot of different ones I’ve played no other MMO with a world like this one. It feels like a Bethesda game and not theme park MMO like ESO. Not that i hate ESO but it certainly isn’t like other elder scrolls games. This one is a fallout game. I’m especially excited for the things that have been announced such as the new vaults that will open which are essentially 4 man dungeons. 
---
That's the engine. They did sort of fix it since fallout 4, but it doesn't work all the time.
---
Thanks.
---
All the drugs you give me will definitely be sold to kids outside Morgantown school though js
---
It was fake there was never any evidence it was real
---
Not enough players to ban sadly
---
I'll send you a request anyways. I'm lvl 53 currently but haven't found a two shot yet so might take that off you.
---
Been doing a lot of exploring? 
---
Hey, it's none of my business what you do with the stuff once it's out of my hands, lol!
---
That bug is pretty specific though.
---
If you trigger a mutation as you die that one will be bugged until haiku clear it.
---
You should get more as you go though
---
Should.  
---
Have they **EVER** had those kind of tools for any other fallout game?
---
Nope.   Modders made those tools.
---
Yes. Just be careful where your mouse is located (if you're on PC) as it can screw you over if it's highlighting Item B while your choosing the price and quantity for Item A.
---
&gt;  I have over 400 of them hehe.
---
So *you're the one* crashing the servers! Duping all those holotapes! /s
---
This would be a limitation of their DB schema. 
---
Eh. That joke doesn't really work because, "this time next year," is still just a year away... which is exactly what he meant.
---
Personally I think there should be a chance that explosive weapons backfire - they break and you take the damage (and the chances and damage double with multi shot). It only makes sense 👹
---
Yes! And a few kind strangers leaving things in front of me :)
---
Chill. They were just asking a question. 
---
lmao what.
---
You'v never lost your entire suit of Power Armor to a bug and written support?
---
Never lost your entire camp?
---
All you have to do to see he's right is write support.
---
Please don't report meeeeeee!
---
You are an idiot...and a waste of air sir....you can just leave the community
---
Not the vendor, the broken down house on the way to the vendor. Inside the display cases you can find the actual base armor plans. I found two at the same time for wetsuit and sturdy robot arms.
---
I O U 1 TP
---
[bunch of cork soakers](https://youtu.be/Deqx-Xb-yHY) 
---
I don't think so, sadly
---
I’ve only seen this guy once. Is it even worth tracking him down? Does he have good blue prints?
---
Little info on each as I've had my camp at each for some time.
---
The Gold/Copper one he says he's not sure is close enough does work. It's also one of the best locations because it's right outside of nuke prime zones, has 2 vendors a walk away and is pretty much the center of the other 5 vendors Harpers, R&amp;G, Lewis and the 2 Whitesprings. Both produce the ore so there's that.
---
The Acid/Lead one is a good location in terms of fast travel but very bad in terms of walking anywhere because it's right in a massive mountain range. It also does work like he said you just have to place the camp in the middle of the ledge, there's a sweet spot where it reaches to the back of the cave all the way and to the lead. There is indeed always a scorchbeast there, nice if you can farm him, annoying otherwise.
---
The Acid/Fertilizer one is near a place to get a lot of rubber so thats nice, but otherwise it's probably the worst in terms of travel cost as it's the farthest north/west. Low level enemies, mutants, not very secluded so you'll need turrets for sure.
---
The Steel/Copper one is nice because it has a good view and is fairly secluded from enemies except very very few low levels but you don't really need turrets honestly, also fairly flat land. Steel is in scrap, Copper is not. The downside is it's right next to the vault so it's pointless to use the vault as a fast travel point which makes it not the greatest as a travel spot in terms of cost, but not as bad as the fertilizer and junk spots way up north/west.
---
The Junk/Lead one is waaaay up north so the cost is also pretty bad for travel, but not as bad as the fertilizer spot, the enemies aren't too bad but there are always enemies. Lead is in scrap.
---
If you aren't looking for a specific resource and just want the best double, I'd go for Gold/Copper &gt; Acid/Lead = Junk/Lead &gt; Steel/Copper &gt; Acid/Fertilizer
---
It seems you missed
---
Then dont play go play the shit game rdr2  
---
Seriously you are stupid
---
I’m not sure with support not being able to restore lost items has to do with the programmers and server admins being able to track dupers?
---
It is ridiculous.  Which is why Bethesda needs to make it easier to get rid of than simply dropping it on the ground
---
I feel the same. Finally made it to a point where the caverns showed up on my map and figured that would save it, so I went back to base to make more ammo. Of course, the quest reset. I figured screw it, let me see what’s in here and maybe it’ll just let me find the loot I needed. Of course, I get mobbed by upteen level 60 scorched, survived but am now out of ammo and resources. Now I have to farm for steel and lead. Again. Ugh. 
---
I don't, I don't even have a TSE. But how is it not a mechanic? It is something they have put in the game and not everyone is crying foul? Why?
---
I don't see how you claim I say it is a pinnacle. I quite clearly stated I don't have the time to replay it because *some* people want to use a poorly designed game element to their advantage, because I have my own life outside the game.
---
But you do you buddy. Down votes don't mean anything outside the make believe importance of this website. 
---
They only provide 10 energy but if there respective nuclea reactor is repaired they provide 100 energy but anyway you can find substations by going to there respective nuclear reactor and there will be a map of all substations and places they power of you look on this little map you might see green or yellow dot and if you hover over it and a button you will have it marked on your map
---
It is a limitation. There is no reason to assume that items work any differently behind the scenes than they did with fallout 4. Namely, that the base entry for an item, let's use a bat, is a single entry with a base ID. When a bat is spawned into the game, of any variety stemming from that base entry, it is given a unique reference ID that exists only in the game (it doesn't exist in game files or the engine, you can't open up a game editor and find it, but you could a save editor). Even if you dupe an item, the game still generates a separate reference ID for it because that's how it spawns new items in. 
---
Those reference items are the ones that show up ingame, in the world, in inventories. 
---
 Probably. I get around. 
---
 Its a bit random what plans you run across so I will eventually find the Combat Shotgun plan.
---
That's nice, where are these kind strangers lol? Btw which platform is this? Guessing not PS4 since I can't find you? 
---
Did you even read the story? They didnt die because of the war, they died after the war. 
---
There is no pleasing some people xD
---
With as far gone as the duping system has become, the only tangible solution besides a "Mass Deletion of duped items" is to nerf the effects of TSE. If you mass delete items, it'll delete more than TSE weapons. Every item has been duped at some point for one reason or another. PvE/PvP Currency? how or where would that work? Craftable legendaries would be all inclusive to how the system is now, but with no RNG concept. People would still buy with real life currencies the most OP weapon money can buy. Mass suspension and bans wouldn't work out for a community that barely has a player base to begin with, the game would die 6 months into release. Creating "Soulbound" items defeats the purpose the game was originally intended for. No human NPCs, other players are essentially just unique vendors as you conquer and take back Appalachia. 
---
Although, I can agree with higher tier itemization, and i'm sure new bosses or mobs will be released over time that even with duped TSE items around, will still be rough to fight.
---
To be clear, I am not defending the idea of item duping, but the ways you want to "fix" the game, it's not an MMO, server max size being 32, and servers not even reaching that capacity kinda sucks as is.
---
I just do a ton of exploring. Every time I pass through an area I at least check the plan/mod spawn point there. I do most events and dailies that I pass by. I'm at double your level and am still missing plenty of stuff though - I just bought my first raider power armor calibrated shock today, and my first excavator calibrated shock last week. Still have yet to ever get any kind of jet pack mod or plan for any power armor.
---
100%
---
Just search the codes for the week, don't bother decoding bud
---
what lvl are ya running with
---
Yeah, I get this most of the time now as opposed to ‘disconnected from server.’
---
&gt; and he dropped a screw 
---
Such a fine purveyor of the witty exploitation of the meanings and ambiguities of words
---
As someone who has been playing fallout and online games in general for about 10 years. This release is simply not up to par with others. What's end-game?  
---
Go to the place with the most mobs regardless of where it is and farm them for legendary gear. Cool. That's literally it.  
---
Not enough content = Player needs to slow down? Nope. Other online games still have a purpose to playing after a month and reaching a high level. It's in their design.
---
&gt;in
---
A lot of it is because the game is badly designed. If you go scavenging and come back with say 2-300 lead and then bulk the lead in lots of 20 or whatever it is, the server will actually start to lag out.
---
Same goes for making large batches of ammo.
---
Duping is not the suspect in this, a poorly coded game is the root cause of all of these issues.
---
Even if duping were a contributing factor, you'd hope the game were designed for it to be trivial to identify users who are duping. But Bethesda still hasn't done shit.
---
Totally agree! I just don't understand playing a game and needing to cheat... Just play the way it was meant. Cheating to be the best doesn't really make you the best...
---
I've ran into him twice.  First time he disappeared before I could kill him, second time he wasnt so lucky (well, a crit stealth shot from the dragon to his head kinda took his luck away). No good loot that i can remember though.
---
Yeah I’ve heard that you can do that, but then I can’t complete the quest since one of the requirements is to “acquire a nuclear code piece”
---
But not always, so that's an improvement. 👍
---
That then excludes players who farmed for legit items at the cost of punishing everyone to get those who duped. That's an awful idea. 
---
Obtaining plans, crafting the weapons then scrapping them is a consistent but grindy way to get mods for weapons. Handmade plans are "difficult"(time consuming) to get due to it requiring an alt, and Gauss plans are located in the enclave armory (only accessible to generals) From what I know, specific plans and mods are usually found in the world, while plans to make an actual item (including camp stuff) are found on vendors with differing level requirements (sometimes?) throughout the world, maybe even on Graham or the random encounter responder vendor bot and as rewards for events. Yeah, at lvl 100+ I seem to also find the same ol' mods laying around. 
---
Can you read? Did I write they died before the war or even during? No.
---
I got an alt to level 15 and am now level 16 (trying not to level anymore) and am finding it a lot in Harpers Ferry. I did get it from the Watoga Train Station once of twice, but am getting it often from Harpers Ferry. I got 3 plans (one for me and my two friends) then have gotten 5 more today.
---
I’ve been praying for some sort of new under armor. There’s not nearly enough of it, I want to be able to see all my badass wasteland armor while I’m kicking ass. I don’t want to look like I’m out fighting scorch beasts wearing nothing but a pre-war sundress. 
---
Good luck keeping your gatling Plasma repaired enough to get throw 2 or 3 of them in one trip though...
---
I. O. U. Beer
---
....And this upvote because I loved finding those notes.
---
Understandable, yet Skyrim in 2011 had decent graphics for that time period but fast forward close to a decade later and fallout 76 looks like an indie project rather than a triple A game.
---
 Charleston vendor? Tell me more please.
---
How is that a counter to any of what I've mentioned? This is a shit game and the playerbase deserves far better. Having functional servers is a bare minimum for any online game.
---
And previews of plans so we know what the hell we’re buying. 
---
There is a chance the perk card is helping slow down the food/water usage of Speed Demon. You could do some testing to find out by timing it or something.
---
&gt;Offline
---
And how do you suggest that'd work? Your stuff disappears.
---
Thank you. Guess I can quest away after getting lvl 82. 
---
I kind of want to double up on the unarmed mutations on a new character.
---
I’m just hoping unarmed is comparable to 2 handers
---
It says the end of the month. 
---
Even 76 is inaccessible after you leave. 
---
Yeah the same people that probably never read a letter or terminal entry and just rush to the the objective,then say missions have no back story and it's just playing fetch.
---
It's not a post, it's a comment.
---
The existing communities should be banning players selling duped content, but last I checked they instituted a no witch hunting rule after a bunch of posts on trade stealing and dupers. 
---
It was never unsafe.... the supposed glitch was just a lie made up by haters with no proof ever provided.
---
Dude, I hadlve had no luck at 8 most of the game, after level 80 I started shifting it lower and I am definitely getting better drops now.  I totally feel you on the farming though, I make my whitesprings rounds and nuke rounds and can't find a GOOD 3* weapon to save my life.....I mean besides an assassin + 40% swing speed + 90% reduced weight rolling pin...

---
You know, I am considering going back to Sugar Grove just to get a 2nd copy of SIPHON. I'd like to start loading it into every single terminal that I can just to hunt for easter eggs.
---
I play this game solo like every other fallout and at least at level 32, I don't see how all the duping really would affect me too much. I don't intend to pvp.
---
They can't restore lost items because they have no tools to see what items you've had. Which means they have no tools to track duped items... because duped items are just regular items... which they can't track... because no system to do so. No tracky items. No.
---
Make them!
---
Unless it lets you learn something special, hard pass. Intelligence is already full of talents that you only use when in camp. And especially ones that become less useful at higher levels. Need to come up with useful active skills for intelligence instead of treating it as a minor dump stat. Give me crafting meds and basic explosives out in the field or increased resistances/weaknesses for using the right or wrong damage types against enemies. Something that actually reflects some kind of intelligence centered character style.
---
It's a rare spawn outside the shack right next to the charleston train station. A vendor bot with a pack brahmin and an eyebot or two. It sells some regular crap, two unique plans for a cuckoo clock and nuka cola clock, and two random "rare" outfits. Some of them are just uncommon stuff like a witch hat or straight jacket, but a few of them like the hunter's coat are exclusive to that vendor. 
---
WestguardWK brings up solid points. With that being said, those are some top notch ideas truthfully, I'd like to have a brahmin follow me if i was doing vendor things.
---
Go and waste hundreds of hours of your life in pursuit of feeling special. I don't need that shit. And you are not the spokesperson for any community, but if you were I wouldn't want to belong to it. If I could know for sure I'd turn my ruthlessless up a few notches. I'm really too nice to people who don't deserve the time of day.

Had Vlad and Mia right here, along with the responder eye bot and the messenger event

The story is me finding the place. It begins with me at sutton station and ends with me pausing my game playing to contemplate how all the things could have played out for the people that were living in the tower. It meets your requirements for a story. Sorry you couldn't understand that. But have a good one all the same and good luck out there.
---
Nice my embarrassing story is I set up a trade with this guy 2 shot Gatling gun and 500 caps after I bought it I could not learn it I was really confused went back to my base and I already had the plans! Super annoyed spent so much time server hoping too!
---
I figure they figure they've spent enough on music rights already. Though I agree; it would be nice if they could put more songs in there. I'd just want the ones I liked from 3, NV and 4 ;)
---
Set up your camps in smart places. The middle of the mire, away from roads or map markers, won't get you many visitors, and your 3* weapons might be a bit pricy for the players on the road between the overseer's camp and Flatwoods.
---
That said, I'm hoping to set up vending machines at every workshop I capture. An ammo vending machine placed outside a completely sealed and fortified converted munitions plant, a food machine outside the Sunshine Industrial Farm, etc.
---
I'll need to see more on how they're exactly going to work before I spend too much time figuring out how I'm going to utilize them, but I'm sure I'll be making use of them in some capacity, since my main character is a caravan merchant, and getting more sales in game as opposed to set up on Reddit or discord and organized by server hopping would be ideal, as I could move more product while collecting the resources from my workshops, not worried I'll have to server hop to meet someone.
---
Haha. When playing my fiance has started referring to this as "the song you like" and then turning her speakers up.
---
Why cook when you can eat dog food?
---
You can buy it back if you haven't left the server, just exit the trade bot menu and reenter it, the things you sold should be there.
---
It’s gone
---
Best way to get another one is find someone on Reddit willing to sell theirs. 
---
There's a random encounter where you find a responder dressed scorched with a letter on it (cant remember if he was already dead when I found him). In the letter he talks about being infected and he'll be damned if he's going to become a lab rat - so he split the area.  There were probably a lot that thought along those lines.
---
When I first started all I found for underarmour until level 40 or so was the raider leathers from the sutton vendor, I just assumed, 'well guess it's vault suit or this.'
---
That sucks! :\
---
Will be fixed soon. 
---
Edit: Thanks, all, for the swift reassurance!
---
Not to disagree with you. Have you ever used a 2 Shot Explosive Weapon? You actually die a lot using them believe it or not. 
---
That might explain why we don't get screws for scrapping weapons. Aluminum screws confirmed as Canon.
---
Shitty music? To each their own I guess but I'd hardly call any of the Fallout's selections shitty. Other than maybe Johnny Guitar.
---
RNG is a thing you stupid fuck....give me everything now without trying is stupid...you are a dumbass
---
I'd think that making collection from the pump as fast as collection from any other water source would also correct the issues, right?
---
Nah. He can sell it to somebody or use it himself.  Voltaire said that “Perfect is the enemy of good.” While you could waste more coding time and effort trying for some impossible perfect solution you could have done a good job fixing the problem and also solve 3 more. Farmers can farm more or sell it in person. You can’t make everyone happy anyway. 
---
Lol you just said some of the most obvious shit I've ever read.
---
Games are buggy basically.
---
Hahahahahahah! I'm doing this now. Thank you.
---
Speaking of.... IS there any waterfalls on the map.  Now that I think of it I dont think Ive ever seen one.
---
Not in my experience. I've reloaded my game and my camp was still wrecked as all hell.
---
If the game doesn't load you into a new environment then yea.
---
Same boat, but on pc
---
No it doesn’t. 
---
You mean have a tall plastic of Nuka Dark.
---
Ah uh... yes. Yes my thoughts exactly. 
---
What have I done?
---
I'm sorry your having problems with your connection man, I've only lost connection twice, I don't know if it's Bethesda's fault 
---
Is he dead?
---
Almost as obvious as blind fanboys having to ride the short bus to school.
---
#I DON'T LIKE THE WAY YOU ROLEPLAY IN MY RPG 
---
Believe it or not. A lot of trade groups where duping since game came out and charged full price for items ripping people off.
---
So you had renegade dupers who started duping to under mind those people trying to control and manipulate the market.
---
&gt;They can't restore lost items because they have no tools to see what items you've had. 
---
Not necessarily. There could be many other reasons that support can’t restore items, and most online games have a blanket “can’t restore lost items” policy, though they sometimes make exceptions.
---
&gt; Which means they have no tools to track duped items...
---
If we assume for a second that they actually don’t track, on any level, what items users had (I find this highly unlikely as they most certainly have server backups for X period of time, so they could see the data there), it’s still certainly possible to see what items a person currently has. And if they have 100 explosive damage shotguns or whatever, well...🤔
---
New California has a station like that, breaks some lore just being newer but fits in well also.
---
Interesting, thanks for the info
---
That's a story that you wrote about finding "content" without a story. That's literally what I'm saying. If there was any note or holotape to give any kind of context whatsoever as to what actually might have happened, even a clue as to what happened, I would call it a story. Don't get me wrong I think the best story-telling in this game is not necessarily "told" but almost every location in the game that doesn't have any notes or tapes has a scene like this.
---
Thanks you too, the only thing I currently need is luck because I'm looking for legendaries. Going back to the same places on the map I have been before... Killing random shit for random drops.
---
Thank goodness! You are right. It was there. That was a close one!
---
The question remains, what if I had logged off? 
---
And what in your stash is 100% certainly not duped? Besides the fact the game seems to randomly dupe stuff on the PC any thing you have purchased from another player could be duped. Anyone who has unknowingly bought anything that was duped could lose their gear without getting their caps back.
---
How is punishing a person who legitimately purchased something punishing the exploited? Especially as it was a poorly implemented game mechanic which was at fault.
---
Realistically how do you know what actions you do in this bug fest are working as intended and which are exploits? 
---
inb4 we have to spend four years getting a degree at VTU
---
Interesting, thanks!
---
I don’t have a problem with your suggestions.
---
I just want to point something about the so called economy.
---
The trade option was there to trade and sales with friends and others in your area. I don’t think that System was made with an intention of a mass market economy. If the really had the intention of a mass market Capitalist economy then they would have include a in game mass trading system and board Market Place IE a trading post in game where you posted items.
---
Instead we took the Mechanics of the game and created a black market Capitalist market place through other Social Media avenues.
---
To answer do I believe that black market economy has been hurt by duping. It has drove prices down enough that all items are available to all players at a cheaper price. The Market about 70% was Controlled by a lot of small groups who have been duping since the game came out and they was charging top dollar and slowly putting things out to sale to control the market.  
---
What end up happening more people learn how to dupe and they flood the market with items. Used to be a TSE Handmade or Pump went for 10-20K Caps Each. Then the renegade dupers started selling them for 1-3k each. It drove the price down and it Feed a high demand. So it made the black market a truly a free market. Though it might have hurt some Individual sellers it undermine the corrupt groups that was trying to control the market.
---
Plus the Value and how much Fallout76 can be a free market and Capitalistic is already capped. You can only have 25K Caps at a time per Character. So already your in a controlled structure. Lending Credence that we don’t have a Full free Market And Economy supported in game.
---
That cover resources and everything else. The Question Or Idea of a Market being stable is ridiculous. A market will always go up and down, ebb and flow. The Only way a market stays Stable is if it’s manipulated and controlled.
---
As the question of server bugs and instability of the servers is something to be more upset about. That is a separate situation the complaining about TSE guns and a player created market.
---
Unfortunately, the two friends I know who do play the series are not going to play 76 for their own reasons. I have so little experience in grouping that there would be a big learning curve. Not to mention the solo Medic build did not work out.  
---
There was a lot of info that wasn't around so a lot of mistakes were made. I tried grouping several times but I guess my luck wasn't good those times.  
---
I HATE hearing, "Go to Whitesprings." over and over. It's as if people can't come up with different solutions to leveling or getting good gear. It's all copycat this copy cat that for hours.  
---
I don't have hours and hours every day for this. 
---
Glad you admit what you said is obvious drivel with no substance behind it.
---
Agreed lol I've fired it up just now and I'm sitting here listening to the title screen music while typing this. God I hope I'm not disappointed!
---
Meaning nothing has been done about it yet
---
Mr hOwaRd?... i dOnt FeEL sO goOd....
---
The base skill just pacifies them briefly so you can run or get a free sneak headshot in, I think.  If I'm not mistaken you also need the higher level perk 'Wasteland Whisperer' to tame them and send them to guard your camp. 
---
Right? Take my upvote
---
Oh ok
---
I would like this. Learning lever action plans required like 40+ lever actions and I think I made 30 of them. Lots of screws gone. F for respects.
---
Hopefully they add some more content soon. That's the reason I posted this. Something else to do in the game besides grind for legendaries and sell junk to vendors. Good luck, hope you find something good.
---
You're ridiculous.
---
I know my items haven't been duped by any exploits, just the super duper perk lol.
---
I have never run across any extra items.
---
And even if I did, and then those were later removed, that wouldn't be punishing me. I never earned those bugged items to begin with.
---
Apparently so. Hey, whatever works for you.
---
You can get it from somebody who doesn't want theirs. I have found a couple quest rewards in shops before...one somerset special and two all rises, from what I can recall. The sledge is in a strange situation because it's a great melee weapon and highly desired but also completely useless to gun-only builds
---
SOLVED:
---
I know I’m late to the party here, but I ran into the same issue. 
---
I had accessed the crime log terminal, turned off the game, logged back in, and the entire quest was gone. I was left with what appeared to be a main story I could not progress. Server jumped a ton of times, nada. 
---
Eventually I went back to the crime log terminal as someone had posted that doing so brought the quest back for them. I went back to terminal, went through terminal the options, and nada. The quest did not come back. 
---
I logged off and after some time logged back in. I was about to go on my way when I decided to go back to the crime log terminal one more time. Walked into the room with the terminal and bingo - quest completed. 
---
My advice would be to go back to the crime log terminal and server jump and return a few times. 
---
Hope that helps.

This tells you what legendary modifications can be on the same item, hope this helps (not my work obviously)
---
I posted about this happening to me last night. [My post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abgk14/mods_are_missing_from_my_stash/).
---
In my situation I believe somehow the mods were used while they were in stash when I was out in the world repairing extractors for Uranium Fever. I never bulked any main ingredients down low and I am pretty sure it is the steel mods that are missing. So I probably had very little steel scrap on me and somehow when I repaired them (10 steel each) instead of telling me no, it grabbed it from my mods in stash. All i know for sure is I had over 100 steel altogether between stash and my inventory even after I got back to my stash and realized my mods were missing.
---
You must be a duper....you are ruining this game asshole
---
I get the feeling they're more worried about approaching a modder, having a ludicrous price set, and then never getting to fix it because of "they stole my idea" lawsuits.
---
I bought much of what I have from players.  After a buck twenty levels of getting nocturnal wood legs garbage I gave up.
---
The whole trade bug is fake
---
Because they designed it for the consoles first. 
---
I just want an option to change the appearance of items. 
---
I'm tired of wearing a dress. But it has 1 perception. 
---
Watch it again. There were at least 2 Xs after I turned off passive mode.
---
Yeah enjoy your RNG. I'll be doing something actually fun.
---
On the surface this is a cool idea, it doesn't sit well with mechanics as they are. Why can I not attach a scope to something when I've got five levels of Gunsmith? Likewise, as I've got Armorer rank three, why can I not craft metal arms? I can craft leg armor, but the deep mysteries of adapting that curved metal to an arm eludes me. 
---
The answer to the above is not to introduce a new perk, but to roll an obvious ability into the existing perks that already imply that ability. 
---
No you haven't listened have you? I'm fine with intial reviews. But when articles and videos repeat themselves constantly for the next 2 months latter it just goes to show they don't care about there content as long as they have content. If not enough changes have been made it repeats itself and makes just bad articles which feel like they have been coped and pasted and went from English and back from Google translate. I feel this way for any game not just Fallout 76. I don't think that articles are obliged to have to wait 6 months because of it not being finished completely just that they should to produce better content instead of feeding people anger for views and clicks. Somehow you refuse to see what I meant by my quote. On your previous post you mentioned how I said a lot of improvements have been made but more still need to be made. Then you applied the first half of my stament, improvements have been made, to further the claim of how it needs changes for it to be reviewed again effectively and ignoring how more need to be made. I don't agree with quote one saying that it is time for it to be reviewed again that was just the context meaning of your response to my quote on your previous post. Then the second quote of mine stems from the second quote of your previous post of it being that it still had a lot of bugs which counterdickts statement one in your own logic and the context in which you wrote it. Then you some how manage to forget that I'm not defending the game for bugs I'm trying to defend it from circle jerking which makes the entire gaming community fall into clickbating for views and clicks. So I don't know what your trying to do here, I say while a lot of bugs have been fixed but more progress needs to be made you seem to not comprehend that I say a lot have been fix to highlight how much more work needs to be done for a different review to come out whether it be negative or bad. So at the end of the day your point is its okay to make copy and pasted articles and videos instead of making better content instead of keep having to make them after every major update so they can work on better content.
---
I'm on x1 and have never crashed or died since beta 
---
I don't think they're the same at all. The raiders have specific faction related armour loke the BoS or the fire breathers. Assuming the scorched plague is indescriminant at who it affects, we should see scorched in power armour, or scribe uniforms since the scorched seem to be somewhere between a goul and a feral ghoul. 
---
Honeslty i see the appeal to this. People with money to burn are gonna eat stuff like this up.
---
I actually found a TSE double barrel shotgun as part of my first Uranium Fever run. The feeling was glorious. I blew myself up so many times. Now I just want to find a half decent Handmade so I don't have to rely on the shotgun to do high level content. It was so broken it made the game less fun.
---
Genuinely curious what effect it would have on your gameplay. I guess if someone duped a bunch of orbital beacons and decided to go around blowing up camps thats an asshole move but otherwise what does it do? Lowers the average time to kill the SBQ? It isn't causing server instability, that's just a general issue across the board, I can lag the server at will just by equipping super duper and making ammo, and if I do the same with stimpaks and chemist I can crash the server, the things made of tinfoil.
---
It's not 'hard', it's that it's boring. A majority of 'good' int skills are already only for crafting in base. This is more of the same. It's not interesting or clever, it's just saying you don't mind engaging in an already bad design decision even more
---
How do you set fast travel point?
---
Yup, that is where I lost a bunch of mine last night.
---
Shit a brick when I found the Marine Helmet.  I am an alien ninja.
---
The next person to come along wouldn't believe their luck. 
---
I do agree that favorited weapons should be left off the sell\scrap menu though, glad to hear that you got your back. That would have been a painful loss!
---
For some reason that Excavator glitch backfired on me and I lack any carry weight bonus from the armor half the time. 
---
But that glitch is capped at 100lbs which is not going to cause problems like everyone in your server having unlimited weight all the time. I mean, if they can only boost Stash 200lbs, the impact of unlimited carry weights must have been a real concern. 
---
I wouldn't count on responses from support foot soldiers as canon, though, and jump to the conclusion that there is no possibility to monitor stuff on a higher level. All we really know for sure is just that they won't restore items. ;)
---
My friend group and I will now, while hanging out irl, just randomly start belting Country Roads at random interval, with the chorus usually shouted loudly. 
---
Give it time. I enjoy this game but with well over 40 hours played I can say that it is *about* as bad as people are saying. It's a bit better already but goddamn has it been a bumpy road. I find new ways this game will erase your time and effort almost every day. Be it from items evaporating when dropped or letting you put your gear in the hopper during the feed the people event. When scrapping items the list of items like rearrange itself after each scrap. If you run low on a material the game will automatically scrap your mods for the materials. There is little to no way around this except to just make sure you never run out of that material. It will even scrap mods before scrapping bulk items. And best of all, unlike other developers with this kind of game, Bethesda hasn't built themselves the tools to help players who fall victim to these things.
---
yeah I find em at a rate of about 1 plan per 10ish robobrains
---
Oh shit I can dupe items?
---
On my shotgun i have a hardened receiver with a true long barrel i think that works the best so far in the way of shot guns.
---
A transmorph system would be great.
---
I'm mostly positive that there isn't. If they were to put one in they should do Blackwater Falls. Beautiful place and location falls in line for most of the places they have in game.
---
Then maybe he should have said "write support " or show where at any point Bethesda told him (or anyone ever) that they did not have the tools. 
---
But he didn't.  He said "use Google ". Which, again, could pull up all manner of bullshit with no verifiable proof. 
---
I'd have been ok with it being a built in luck stat. Chance to not lose durability to armor based on luck. Maybe for weapon based on int to imply proper maintenance?
---
They actually exist? I assumed it was just a legend.
---
Grognak's Axe cannot be over repaired.
---
You can modify the combat rifle with a mod to use .38
---
Alien.  Ninja.  That is all.

Found the plans in a red rail car directly west of the Watoga Station. Plans were kinda half stuck into the top of a wooden crate just inside. Heading west along the tracks, if entering the rail car from the left (south) side, the plans are to the left on the left side on top of a crate. 
---
This was for marine torso plans.
---
When I put the full armor on, 3 lvl 62 Ghouls (that looked like the hulk) came outta nowhere and proceeded to fuck me up with rad worms and haymakers. It's probably just coincidental, but I'm never doing it again..
---
Watching it again helped I see where the problem is his health DID go down after getting hit
---
Really? I thought I was able to stack Glowing Meat, Yaoi Guai Ribs, and Mutant Hound Steak..
---
Hmmm. Maybe you can try it out against a tanky target and see which one kills in less shots? Might work. 
---
The single raisin in the chocolate chip cookie is such a good idea for a harmless prank.  
---
I shall share with you my favorite prank:  chicken bouillon popsicles.  Essential summer time treat for the soul. 
---
Awesome. Thanks for the help!
---
as much as i try to stay logical and reasoning, there is more to the world than just who knows more facts. opinions and emotions come into play dealing with other human beings. just keep it in mind.
---
My best are a tie between 3 (all TSE) a handmade, lever action, and shotgun
---
To mod their games with the creation kit you have to accept a EULA preventing this FWIW. 
---
That I can get behind. But where does it stop? Someone in another redit was saying they'd been tasked by their clan to gather 50 cores.
---
How is a 8hr a week trader competing with that? Will they be calling for more restrictions?
---
I get that some people are taking the piss but in the end how does it hurt you? Not everyone will be going to Walmart, just like real life. Not everyone will be "close" to a Walmart. You're going to need to compete with vendors anyway. Most of the items they sell won't be worth the time to produce. As much as I like RP and as much as Bethesda want us to "fill the roles of NPCs" in a shoot and loot focused game like this trading really isn't viable outside of the strict RP element anyway. There may be a market for super high end grinding items like Stable Flux and Serums but I haven't in my 200 ish hours ever Needed to trade for anything. I'd Like to trade my ammo away but I honestly just hoard it until I build some low level guns and go give it away free at the Vault or the overseer's camp. 
---
This is not multiplayer fo4. Not by a long stretch. I just wanted a functional working game that was relatively bug-free and had a realised end-game.
---
If you become wanted, drop all of your junk in your box at your base and await the inevitable. Worst case, you'll lose 10 caps unless you've been harassing others constantly.
---
And I thought my game was broken, the only thing to do in the game and it s broken, nice 2019 start Bethesda 
---
He posted it on the Internet forum, Reddit, so... yeah, it’s a post... it can also be a comment, don’t be pedantic.
---
You think the raiders of the Commonwealth got together and decided that 12 belts was an acceptable uniform option? Ô_õ
---
I love my Assassin's Raider chest piece. The look of it mainly, and I also have 3 other pieces of Assassin gear which is nice. I would say that is my best because of how cool it looks. 
---

---
I'm just guessing, but it sounds like it would be in the vendor inventory list for the wandering Charleston bot trader along with the Hunter's Longcoat. 
---
IIRC there was a witch just laying on the street in the mire; had the plans on her. 
---
I paid 1000's for my TSE weapons. If they turn into AATS weapons im returning the game.
---
I would but I am on Xbox! It is easier with two people.  Have the higher level aggro it and melee while the other person stands back and shoots and tries to take out the other mirelurks who show up
---
Improved? Yeah, still isn't good. 
---
It’s definitely broken.  I have 15 max perk cards and my “fully max a perk” challenge is still at 0
---
yeah, idk what happened, i think he left, thanks for coming though.
---
Didn’t common sense make that seem like a clear possibility when they bought it? People know duping is happening. Buying hard to find, high value items from players has a huge potential to be those duped items. At some point duped items may be fixed and vanished. No innocent, wide-eyed high level player dropping thousands in caps really exist, sorry. 
---
If I buy a Rolex on the street and the cops seize it, nobody is going to be shocked. 
---
Does that ruin the current game economy? Yes. Exactly. Duping is ruining the game economy. Fixing it is necessary. Protecting those who participated is not. Also, the game is a couple of months old. It’s not like some little old lady is losing their life savings here.  One on. 
---
I believe your over reacting. It’s a good thing the dupe bug happened now and I will explain.
---
Fallout76 will be the last Fallout for 5-10 years. Fallout76 will be ported over to PS5 and the Next Xbox.
---
This game will get more content free DLC and Expansion like Destiny and ESO. We will have our first Raid in the next 3 months or less.
---
Secondly as more difficult content is added so will the scale of Legendaries change.Right now only 3 Star Legendaries drop. In the future 4-5 Star will start drop. Not only with the star ranking of Legendaries go up so will the Level of the Gear. Will start to get level 60,70 5 Star Legendaries that will over shadow and out perform 2 and 3 Star Legendaries.
---
So duping right now was good for the game for a few reasons. First being they know it’s a big and a glitch. They will figure out the code and mechanics that cause it and patch it permanently. Second it is good to have all these TSE and Melee duped because it’s keeping playing the game at a time where the game is buggy and the is a stigma and bad reputation about FO76.
---
As for the Market that will recovery after duping and new content makes the duped weapons worthless.
---
People are having a knee jerk reaction about all this and are not thinking about the long term plans and future of the game. That’s why Bethesda hasn’t over reacted yet.
---
As for the market here is my thoughts on that.
---
Exactly, why is jumping ship or turning the other cheek the only two options? The game has serious flaws for a fully priced game, and many players like OP have legitimate concerns.
---
INT should grant a passive bonus at % chance to add a legendary effect to a crafted item, or more than one effect. INT is the crafting stat, by nature of the game. Instead, crafting has no possibility of being as good or better than the most basic high-end drop.
---
 Well of course free would be better, just saying.
---
I want what I grind for in these games to mean something... I played diablo 2 for a couple of years grinding for specific gear online.. Then cheaters got the gear for no time investment and made the grind worthless
---
also check out fo76map.com
---
Or just fix the duping. One they have they can also do another minor change like introduce level 50+ items or even make Two Shot and Explosive incompatible. No one would be HURT by such a change. And we can all carry on, or restart if you wish.
---
Stash increase will definitely help. I cart all my ammo round because the bandoleer perk means it’s more efficient than storing it, and I’m always at capacity. If they can give us significantly more room in our stash, I’ll happily swap out the bandoleer perk and store what I don’t need.
---
It's under the misc tab. Only works for public workshops, tho. Can't do it at camp for literally no good reason.
---
Lol, no - I haven't lucked up enough to get one.  Mostly what I said was TiC just as a response to the people complaining about them.
---
I'm in the same boat as you. That's why if they do anything like this, it would have to be a damage effect for a damage effect. The other ideas people have thrown out would be even more devaluing, like raising the levels on everything by enough to make TSE useless, delete explosive entirely, etc. 
---
At least with AA you still get increases in your damage output per shot
---
Indeed, appreciated
---
What do you not understand pls explain I'd love to have a conversation about it
---
Oops! I didn't know it was loaded!
---
I would love if in the future someone made a mod that made you a scorched or super mutant
---
 That is the kind of thing I would not even mind.  It is not a pay to win thing, just QOL, id it supports free DLC then I am ok with it, unless it unbalances the game towards people dropping lots of money.  
---
in the bog I found this guy in a storage shed with like 6 Robco Research facility cards. I don't know if this is a glitch or what..
---
Same thing happened to me with my jet pack and a shock :)))
---
To little content on initial release and/or poor game pacing has been the issue.  This is a mmorpg and needs a endgame loop, the queen is a great global boss but their needs to be repeatable dungeons that your group (and your group alone) at various lvl's can run over and over for rare loot.  Not sure how they can get that to work with the fire power everyone has these days tho =/
---
&gt;Then you applied the first half of my stament, improvements have been made
---
Now now, don't misquote yourself. A LOT of improvements.
---
&gt; to further the claim of how it needs changes for it to be reviewed again
---
Your words. Big changes = valid new review.
---
&gt; ignoring how more need to be made.
---
So no more reviews until it is fixed. Got it.
---
&gt;Then the second quote of mine stems from the second quote of your previous post of it being that it still had a lot of bugs which counterdickts statement one in your own logic and the context in which you wrote it.
---
This is all based off of YOUR logic. Not mine. You are the one who said reviews need to wait for the game to change. You are the one who said lots of improvements have been made. You are the one who said those improvements don't count because there are still issues.
---
&gt;Then you some how manage to forget that I'm not defending the game for bugs I'm trying to defend it from circle jerking which makes the entire gaming community fall into clickbating for views and clicks.
---
No, let's get this sorted. YOU think they are clickbaity. YOU think they are a circlejerk. YOU are the one disagreeing that they cover different issues while at the same time claiming changes have been made to the game (lots of changes, but not ones worth reviewing).
---
And if we want to argue about copy pasted content being bad then Fallout 76 should just be scrapped as a copy paste of Fallout 4 with half the assets hidden behind atom shop pricing.
---
Theres literally an event called uranium fever
---
doesn't matter if they use sequel or an in memory database they can track items. The question is are they willing to do something this late in the game.
---
If they raised the levels it would make level 100+ guys OP to all the level 50-90 guys that used to have a chance to fight back with their TSE's
---
Check the photo gallery.
---
One Hit Kill. When you hit someone to initiate PVP it only delivers a very minor portion of damage. Some builds are so powerful that minor portion is still more than their health and they die instantly without initiating combat. 
---
Ah gotcha. 
---
The tux set looks rather spiffy
---
I don't know I was thinking something more on the lines of make it to where demolitions expert doesn't apply to your explosive guns. Or, and I know this will get some hate, make it to where two shot and explosive can't be on the same weapon. How to go about doing it to currently owned weapons I wouldn't know. Either way whatever changes happen there's going to be some really angry people about it.
---
I make and sell glowing steaks. They go for a mint at the vendors.
---
Please stop encouraging a vendor at camps. No one goes to our camps. We need an auction house. 
---
Get some new material Razor, I can see you using the 'Yeah guys youre right' crap 3 times, at once, on my screen, all visible at once. This isn't how comedy works.
---
I tested with Glowing Meat Steak and one of the Yao Guai foods and they didn't stack.  There may be some other combination that will, but based on the fact that no other combination of other food types stacked for other benefits I made the presumption that this is true across the board.
---
Exactly. That's another reason to not raise the overall levels for gear.
---
Go ask about it over on /r/relationshipadvice and learn all about how toxic the relationship is and you're probably beating her too
---
And maybe the people who are experiencing all these emotions would do well to remember that their emotions are **their own** responsibility. I didn't cause you to have an emotion, **you** created and experienced that emotion. Pick up a little zen; you are the master who makes the grass green.
---
Makeshift and gun nut are a total bummer. I hate how they kill specialisation too. When my mate and I started playing, we agreed that I would craft all our weapons for us, while he did the Armor. We were really excited about the prospect of helping each other out with our varied skill sets. 
---
Of course now we realise he needs all the crafting perks too to stop the things I have crafted for him from falling apart, thus making our original division of labour completely redundant.
---
I just doing a write up on duping and TSE right now. Take a read.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abpcpn/here_is_some_thoughts_about_duping_and_the_market/?st=JQEMFZRH&amp;sh=fbd22cce
---
If you logged in and had all the best stuff out of the vault why would you play....or on the other side if you logged in and everyone but you cheated to get the best gear and the best you could do was grind away to catch up with ppl who started the game that way...then again why play
---
Still harping about the beta time slots? 
---
Wow. 
---
I just read about this with regards to the mothman omelette.  My next project is to find out what sells for the most now lol.
---
Do this with legendary mobs that don’t have drops also. 
---
I've never had this happen to me. Does it just take an item at random?
---
Great idea! The plague walker should have a hazy aura around the character, kind of like Pigsty in Charlie Brown.
---
Ain’t I Right - Marty Robbins.
---
We need this.  It is a great song.
---
No matter what, people will definitely be upset. That's why I'd hope they'd find a way to keep the damage relevant while making it less OP. 
---
Swapping a first slot mod for the explosive effect would prevent any new TSE weapons from being created and would affect all current ones too
---
I get the demolitions expert, but they put the system in for weapons to have multiple effects, why remove the one people like most? What would happen to all the TSE weapons if that did happen?
---
Undoubtedly, but we need some rough bruisers around for the high and mighty to look down upon and gasp at.
---
It takes balance out of the game and pride when you find something good
---
76 doesn't have a Robot Workbench....
---
I don't see how someone else having something devalues the effect the item has on your gameplay. Someone could have the exact same legendary as you legitimately, would that somehow make the item worse in your eyes as well? I can understand not wanting to partake in the process or use gear provided by a source you know is exploiting on the level of earning something with your work but I don't think someone else doing so devalues my own achievements, just that others took shortcuts to obtain them. 
---
There are ways round them, you are right. It’s just a whole lot of faff instead of allowing you to just focus on the fun parts of the game.
---
Oh nvm lol
---
Maybe they should pick up the phone and call Blizzard. When duping was a thing in Diablo II, Blizz knew and called forth the "Rust Storm." It deleted all duped items. Of course, the side effect was Chinese gaming sweat shops where "players" played 24/7 in order to sell the items on whatever site via mule accounts. At least the items were legit. You paid for, not the item, but their "services."
---
Today I caught a person, takayuki45, duping items with a low level (typical dupe symptoms). I was in the area and went after them, but it wasn't what I thought: it wasn't for items. The low level disappeared and I found after scouting his CAMP he was duping low level stuff in order to 'craft' his way for  XP. While I made my way through the mire, he stood at his chem bench for hours crafting items for XP.
---
As a matter of fact, I do think that. It probably looked like an interational world leader summit. In all reality obviously they need those belts because they never know if the pants they loot will fit or not. 
---
Yeah, power armour protects you while it is worn, but they don't sleep in it and aren't always in it. 
---
Edit: I meant Power Armor Paint: The paint would be available on T-45, T-51, T-60, and X-01.
---
Allow user to link Spotify playlists and accounts. Someone made a pretty awesome Fallout Christmas themed playlist I’d have love to listen to the past few weeks. 
---
If private servers ever come i hope we can get a much larger camp space and camp budget for it
---
My best self found, has to be bloodied explosive gatling, next being vanguards/+str/sentinel left leg. Tse weapons but yeah traded for (dont count)
---
Like a tuxedo paint? Agreed.
---
Yeh i meant 15% faster crit rate in vats (and upon checking) 25% faster firing rate. This combined with a prime and 2 shot is also strong. I have cycled through so many guns and their stats that I made a mistake. Thanks for the correction.
---
If you’re on PC. Friend me, DimmaDan, I’ll make an upgraded bat for you while you look for plans. 
---
It's still just a partial fix for the speed issue. High frame rates still cause the physics engine to freak out and send clutter flying around 
---
Except for the guy that was spawned into one of the sealed vaults after dying. He posted a  screenshot of the terminal as proof.
---
Cranberry Relish is the better XP food and also fairly easy to make. Sugar isn't hard to come by just run through the riverbed by Flatwoods and gather the materials to make your own.
---
I only ever play with it on, tonight I was working on my camp and my buddy told we had a player near us. Went to investigate and found a camp, so we just waved and went back to mine so I could finish decorating. Two more of his friends logged on, came over and played nice for a bit.
---
The third the other two claimed wasn’t with them continually tried to attack my friend and I. So finally my buddy turned and killed him. He came back and killed my friend so I killed him and then I realized the other two were red. Come to realize they’d been lying the whole time.
---
Things got interesting after that because all 3 of them played using stealth boys or chameleon. At least one had an explosive shotgun, another an explosive rifle. We basically wasted a half hour out of aggravation killing them and dying ourselves because only one would engage us at a time at a time. The other two would go stealth and wait to take a shot.
---
But essentially they waited to get us into seeking revenge to deploy their chickenshit strategy to farm us for caps. I’m just as annoyed with them as I am myself for buying into it 😑
---
As one cared to put it: “don’t hate us for understanding the mechanics. Stealth = no vats and your armor gives no real benefit”
---
Yep, if you're not paying attention or spamming the add button you could inadvertently add ammo or other items to hopper with no way to get them back. Apparently it's been like that since the beta, gotta be careful. 
---
Sucks the happened with your shocks, that's balls. 
---
Kind of, just kind of like the paint on the enclave robots in the bunker.
---
That song always gives me chills when I hear the crowd sing it after a WVU win! It’s awesome to hear! 
---
I am in the same boat, I have 17 mutations and I am missing marsupial. I saw it pop up once as I died and when I respawned it wasn't there, haven't seen it pop up in over 3 days. Looks like I'm going to have to re-farm them all, or watch when I radaway to see if it drops off.
---
what level is he ?
---
You'd think that, but EULA's have been challenged before. And can you imagine the headlines if that happened right now? "Bethesda tries to steal an innocent modder's code for profit" - Forbes.
---
From what I've seen, when you deposit ingredients, it will show a random item from your inventory with the ingredients.
---
Best laugh Ive gotten out of a comment today. 
---
$39.99 is pretty low considering that a lotta people paid full price, and some paid for collector’s editions that ultimately were not as advertised. 
---
They dropped the price almost by 50% weeks later, the game wasn’t fully functioning from the start, so what was the point of even buying it at launch?
---
Could be the *value price* most items have right now? I don't think it's used at all at the moment.
---
Can Ya not block people on Xbox? 
---
I got a three star bolstering marine chest piece with reduced ammo weight and poison resistance. Got it from a glowing radstag at Whitesprings. 
---
I do have one other reason, cause Im a nice guy.
---
E.g. when farming whitesprings with other players and not teamed I let others 'tag" the enemies so that they get a chance to get loot. Otherwise its all mine.
---
Modern gaming servers are VIRTUAL servers so the old 'crap servers' explanation never applies, not anymore. Further, internet speeds from the datacenters hosting these virtual machines are so fast that internet speed is also not a thing.
---
The ASSUMED situation is that the virtual machines are set for a certain expected load, but ANY sort of exploit that involves creating endless amounts of ANYTHING is going to crash the virtual server. 
---
You might want to look into mutations, they might be able to improve your build overall
---
Go make a support ticket, query for missing items. It states on their support page that they are unable to make changes.
---
So either there are 2 options
---
- they just don't have the ability
---
or 
---
- "fuck you players, we have the tools to help you but we don't give a shit"
---
Hey. I could be wrong, maybe they DO have the tools.
---
That’s not PvP, silly. 
---
It’s leftover from a glitch that would dupe any workshop items placed on the ground and placed them under “stored” in the build menu of your camp.
---
You could place these items down for free, irregardless of the limit, however you could build nothing else, including something as small as a wire. That’s why you see only machine gun turrets.
---
1. If you place your camp but have to move it because of the seemingly arbitrary placement system, you should get your caps refunded. Getting pretty sick of spinning my house around what appears to be a fairly flat and unobstructed area just to be told over and over that I can't place it, then having to spend caps all over again to move my camp 20 feet over.
---
2. Option to automatically drop spoiled food and beverages.
---
3. Some sort of perk to highlight enemy corpses would be nice. Dead enemies disappearing into the rubble or brush has been an annoyance since Fallout 3.
---
Don't understand why this is hard to get
---
Drop your decon shower into storage before leaving if you're worried about raiders, paying pure flux for repairs is a real pain.
---
I kinda want some Red Communist foot soldier kinda outfit. Having the American Winter Armour from FO3 would be neat as hell as well.
---

---
I keep wondering what is going to happen with this game.  Say they finally find a fix, how do they implement it? Worldwide server reset of items? Something else?
---
I'd be happy if they dropped the star requirements for each of them, down to 1 star each, so I could a lil versatility to my build.  Hate how I have to spec so heavily into a specific build to make it viable.  Otherwise I'm wasting ammo....
---
I will never not upvote this. If you find more, I'd love to read more.
---
The problem is, I didn’t leave. I was standing right there while I was away for 3 minutes.
---
:/
---
She doesnt want to move her base. 
---
Just have her block him and not be joinable, also wouldn't hurt to report him to xbox live.
---
Being stuck in terrain has been around in Bethesda games over a decade, I don't think there's any easy fix. At least we can fast travel in interiors now, since you can't toggle clipping with the console any more. 
---
It's super easy to get away from people.
---
Unfriend and the chance they get in a server with you is 1 in 1,000.
---
If they happen to get in the same server again, server hop and it's 1 in 1,000.
---
This or five guys got together and wasted their entire turret limit in one area
---
As a level 20, I challenged myself into engaging combat with a level 30 sentry bot. I used sniper rifles and terrain, and had no problems at all. 
---
Then I'll 12am this
---
Wait! How can I dupe? Any tricks you could teach me...
---
Even if you message them asking just to fast travel 
---
Are you sure?
---
https://bethesda.net/en/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019
---
Well there's the auto-repair perks under luck, one for weapons (Luck of the Draw) and one for armor (Lucky Break)
---
Where'd you get the 'small player base' data?
---
I have a two shot fatman but not explosive. So I’d guess the same could happen to missle launchers too
---
I'm just saying, some things are the way they are because of the limitations of a video game... They could probably tweak some things like just how frequently they are wearing that particular jumpsuit, but if you really want a reason other than that... It's all the players who got the jumpsuit in Flatwoods and then stopped doing the main quest before they became inoculated. There are so many more players than human NPCs that the jumpsuit shows up disproportionately often.
---
EVERYBODIES DEAD! It's like you aren't paying attention at all. What use is a human NPC if you can't even listen to the robots or holo's they are giving you lol?
---
Oof. Yeah, destroying some afk guy's base is pretty cheap. Sorry you didn't get a chance to react.
---
Rule 9
---
Honestly I don’t hate the system per se. I’m kind of into the fact that you can switch your build up without starting an alt. As many others have pointed out, the ability to switch more easily between pre set builds would be nice.
---
Rather than make things more convoluted by adding in two layers of perks, I’d rather just see the QoL perks themselves balanced so that fewer points get the same results, and the game not be so punishing for those who don’t take them. Increased stash size being an obvious start.
---
Yeah, once you finish the main plot there isn't much in the way of new quests/shit to do so far.
---
I guess the biggest challenge I've had is trying to master the resource system so I never have to worry about finding more lead for ages, but once you get it perfected, which is a bit too easy, there's little else to do.
---
In terms of crafting unique stuff there's not terribly much to explore. You could try hitting up the giant excavator or making an adhesive farm if that's your thing.
---
Supposedly in the coming weeks and months we're going to be getting new content, so I'm optimistically holding out for something good soon.
---
Im gonna start roleplaying as an alien mind slave if zetan aliens come to the game.
---
She should stop playing and unfriend him. It will be rare they get on the same server. That’s what I would do. 
---
I was actually at that point too lol
---
I ended up speccing into melee for the dps in nuked white springs and finding legendaries to trade for my build. 
---
Unfortunately, I'm not too sure if there is a space between badass of the wasteland and "just hit lvl 50" due to the need for high dps against the queen and such
---
Love wandering together, the game is so much better with friends. Feel free to add me, PSN is bumpngrind
---
Because they act broken. You literally have to go into the recent list and find them and accept.  
---
Or they would rather play alone.
---
Yeah that’s what I’m thinking, just gotta find someone on PS4! Thanks for the tip
---
Yeah, that was another challenge I wondered about.  Mines still at 0 too.  Wonder if you have to have all the perks at max rank for each S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stat (probably not, probably just broke - but just throwing that out there)
---
I went through every entry on both upstairs terminals several times with no luck. If it worked before, it's bugged now.
---
I'm relieved it didn't happen to any of my legendaries, but finding the mod has been the bane of my existence.
---
"Extra Blade" is for Mole Miner Gauntlet. "Extra Claw" is for Death Claw Gauntlet.
---
If only you would go radio silent, Wastelander
---
Yeah I would have just left.
---
Block and switch servers? 
---
It’s broken period. Stealth is ridiculous especially facing multiple players at once who are using it so you can’t find them with Vats, not that I use Vats for aiming, just finding enemies.
---
Friend and I found that out the hard way tonight 😑
---
They can cheat when private servers come lol
---
Well I look at it like this: the explosive rounds is game breaking with out a doubt. Everything you do becomes so trivial after you get one even the scorch beast queen is an easy feat. If this keeps up any content they bring out will be walked all over in a couple hours shortening the life of the game and who knows maybe the content they bring out won't be long but I find it kind of hard to enjoy a game when you essentially have a god mode on constantly. But what to do about getting rid of two shot explosives out there I honestly don't have in answer for that cuz you could take them away you're probably going to lose players unless Bethesda can pull a miracle out their ass I feel like this is going to be a lose-lose situation for them no matter what
---
What does handmade mean
---
I go to school or places I know there's telephones my dude and clean up shop. 
---
Solution: Don't buy anything with ludicrous numbers or prices. 500c for a TSE Handmade? Really good odds of being a dupe. 1000 Nuka Quantums for sale? Bet they didn't farm them from the world.
---
Be responsible consumers. Think before you buy. You can't 100% be certain you never buy a dupe, but you can avoid at least the obvious ones.
---
The game's been unstable a lot longer than the last two weeks and I don't know about Bethesda but the only days that most Americans get off are New year's day and Christmas day.
---
Fyi the BGS you mentioned in the post isn't BGS
---
I agree with all of that but i have 3 TSEs and even with 2 full teams we can barely hurt the SBQ Idk why
---
Sugar grove has many fans, globes, and tons of clipboards(for springs).
---
I get DC'ed all the time, lost a piece of gear last night to it. If you don't understand how dupers will ruin the game, let me explain it...
---
You didn't dupe, you want an item, you don't get it because you are competing against people who want items and have hundreds of TSE weapons/godrolls.
---
When you were farming, they were duping, for every decent average item they got a hundred godrolls duped. So really you just have to find your loot naturally, and you will be competing against these people in PVP and you will be getting wrecked.
---
Tag it for search that really helps. If you find a junk deposit, make a camp there and begin farming it. It’s really helpful for resources, like steel and crap. Good luck!
---
Someone will always have a higher level or better gear then you though so you'll always be grinding to catch up unless you started in the Beta and took advantage of the early exploits to boost yourself as well, you're already behind but the game isn't really competitive in the slightest, in the future if they implement a more purposeful pvp there will be issues if they don't also raise the item level to make the current dupes irrelevant but thats a hypothetical at the moment.
---
crazy thing is not once in the last month have i been disconnected more than 2 times. im not sure what everyone is talking about by tanking the servers because me and everyone i play with are fine on the servers.
---
they dont even have the tools to replace lost stuff to their own server issues. they will just increase the weapon lvls once they have they duping under control. no need for the 10,000 post about banning dupers and some sort of punishment
---
General rule of thumb is that each faction shares caps with exception of Graham and the watoga vendor they share the same cap pool
---
The only unique vendors are the bos vendir and the harpers ferry vendor
---
Become one with the junk. Workshops and camp with junk piles with a little focus will have you swimming in all that good stuff.
---
I'm right there with you! I have some TSE wespons that are almost certainly duped considering what I paid for them, but if every other duped weapon disppeared, I wouldn't feel like I need them anymore. It's like an arms race; I just don't want to be at the mercy of every snotnose kid with 500 caps to spend on a TSE pump shotgun. I have no desire to run around griefing people, but I'm done running away from every Tom Dick and Harry with a duped TSE gun.
---
Second floor top of the world would be my hope. 
---
Yeh imagine taking on the event scorchbeast queen at your level- impossible unless your carried by others, which Im sure I read Bethesda said they intended.
---
I agree about the quirkiness of some events and how they play. Ironing out the missions over time from player feedback and gameplay data analytics is to be expected though.
---
Imo you can only test so much during a games  development as there will always be some person who is just so good at thinking outside the square and overcoming whatever it is that stands in their way.
---
Thats what makes this game so rewarding for me.
---
No stealth suit like in fo4. There are chameleon gear and a mutation though.
---
Also if you have a friend you can double team a water pump and it bypasses the animation. You can have 60+ water in seconds.
---
Sounds like my experiences camping when I was a kid. "DON'T TOUCH THE MF'N TENT /u/Jay911!"
---
If i remember correctly, it's somewhere near the PA suit behind a door.
---
Super muties also seem to carry them. 
---
Get a junk extractor in your camp I get about 10-15 everytime I play 
---
I was also quite happily surprised at the low level of griefing in FO76 especially when compared to DayZ with their Kill On Sighted, ARK with their raiding, Minecraft with their griefing, Rust with.... well all of Rust.
---
I've never had any real griefing and you can ignore them 99% of the time and can just quit if you can't.

That's why I did it while intoxicated. Makes it easier.

---
Actually, if you look up the tree a bit, I said "Feel free to email support about replacing an item that was removed due to a bug or glitch. You can post their reply yourself if you like."  
---
You'll get the same boilerplate reply everyone else has, which contains the real fun:  
---
"Due to tool limitations Customer Support is unable to restore lost items."
---
Not just for screws specifically, but I like to hit up the amusement parks. Toys are good for plastic and screws, and all the teddy bears are a good source of cloth and leather. They aren't hotspots so chances are you will have the loot all for yourself and they are relatively safe as well.
---
She doesn’t have to move her base. It will put it back down on whatever server she goes to. If it’s not open she can server hop til it is. 
---
Blocking, unfriending, possibly reporting is the way to go.

Ziiiing!
---
I’m a little confused
---
My water purifiers max out at 5 purified water yet the description for the machines say they make 60 
---
It does it for my brothers too so it’s not just me. Do I have to periodically come back and pick up like every ten minutes?

200 hours in and this is the first I've heard of grape...
---
I understand that, but I think you missed the whole point of my post. I didn't bash the game, didn't say I was mad about it. I asked if there was lore about it. Like if the BoS killed anyone showing symptoms..etc. Many games make up for lack of content, or addition, by including extra info. Think of how bethesda included the BoS in this game. They shouldn't be in WV, so the writers put in an exanation. 
---
There's a post on ebay with a t-51 with jetpack and calibrated shocks, so I assume yes?
---
Short, not-complete-on-purpose version: They load stuff into a crate and lag the server. Doing so in a specific way forces the server to register the stuff in the crate and in their inventory at the same time, creating the duplicate. Again, that's not literally how, but that's the gist of it.
---
There are other online sandbox games considered MMOs, with more high-level/endgame content, and yet still have replay value. Saying the game isn't an MMO because Bethesda decided they didn't want to create extensive high-level-exclusive content is a cop out.
---
Or running your hand down a tent to rain on your neighbors

No, that’s one person’s camp.

---
It's easy enough to write a script to watch for glitching. While it's clearly better to fix the glitch, GTA has implemented this before where behaviors that indicate setting up a glitch flag your character for review, where they inspect your $ balance and owned items to look (probably also automated, looking for dupes is really easy) for evidence of cheating
---
If they simply ran your stash box through a detection script on load, it would slow things down by a bit but they could absolutely check for multiple of the same items. It's not like the major offenders carry all that garbage in their pocket, and it would only be marginally harder to scan player gear.
---
I’ve got an assault rifle with vampirism and explosive shots. It’s pretty nice.
---
Your thinking is somewhat flawed.  It's not the weapons that have been duped that have ruined the market for the shirt term that is the problem.  The problem is the MILLIONS of lbs of junk that will effect the market fir years to come.  Junk will always drive the market.  Adhesive, screws, gears, flux, springs and Stimpacks.  Reguardless of what new armor or weapons are introduced, you will always need junk to maintain it and the serious dupers know this.  I was apart of a team that broke up a duping operation a few days ago, they had 2,000 bulk springs....that was just 1 of the manys items we robbed them of.  It's the junk every day players were able to sell and make a decent profit on and now THAT market will suffer reguardless of what armor or weapon upgrades we get.  I've personally seen the inventory on a duper character at 1.2 million lbs, it was all junk.  He claims to have 4 more.  
---
Didn't have to much trouble,  myself.  Some quests are easier than others.  For bugged quests,  a server hop usually fixes it for me 
---
Marine Wetsuit it's an underarmor

I got a mod on fallout 4 for a custom radio and only put this song and listened to it for hours

Chinese Stealth Suit would rock.  I'd sport that.  I'd also love some clean versions of existing clothing.  But I love my patriot paint so far.
---
Oh, I can’t complain at all. Switched my full melee build to a Power armor+shotguns one just to use it and I’m loving it a lot. Just curious on how even better it would’ve been with a tse.
---
Waste not, fast travel not, amigo!
---
Seriously, even at high level, scorched drop .38 when they fart, never mind when you make them explode. If you ever need more and can't just make it at the bench, just go to morgantown airport with a good melee weapon and farm it up. That's what I was doing until I solidified my supply/expenditure issues with .308

Ah, got it, thanks!
---
Yeah!  Because if there's anything that would make this game better, it's less quest content!
---
Awesome. You get enough so you don't need to server hop or do it everyday and you can stock up. Glad I could help.
---
This has to be a joke. Like, this \*has\* to be ironic.
---
You know you're not the first person I heard had that problem sorry to hear about that for ya man. But on that point as well in the event they do take away two shot explosives and just let you have one or the other on a weapon there will definitely have to be some rebalancing to make up for the lack of those two being together.
---
What you're looking for is the Marine Wetsuit. I haven't found it myself but I hear it's an item you will find around Cranberry Bog and The Mire. You could also probably get plans for it from the vendors there, and it looks like some people find plans for it at the vendor near Top of the World
---
Random team invites may be a difficult sell until some fixes are made. Currently, with the broken PVP and trading systems too many @#$%\^ are griefing. Avoiding other players is one way to stay safe.
---
Even then many people prefer to play solo and have specced their characters for it (max Lone Wanderer hard to give up on a whim).
---
Is this confirmed? Im standing at the terminal now and the only option I'm getting is the nuclear keycard escort but it won't let me select it... I was hoping to solo launch today.. 
---
Ah I see thanks for the help!
---
To fix the junk issues is an easy fix. Increase the resource that it takes to repair and make things. There is a perk card that reduces requirements. So it will make that card more useful.
---
Also I’m sure Bethesda know who the serious dupers are with a ton of inventory. They may not acted now but I’m sure some characters and inventory might be deleted in the future.
---
The problem with this argument is generally the griefers get what they want but the people who prefer PVE get forced to accept PvP because "that's how they want to experience the game". Well it isn't how *I* want to experience the game and why is a griefer's game experience more valid than mine when I'm here trying to you know, play the game and follow the story.
---
A bored Level 200 who end-gamed a month ago shouldn't be my problem or detracting to my game play experience. 
---
My only source of hydration was alcohol and I almost made it until a cave cricket killed me and my last checkpoint was far.
---
Bet it'll be a weight limit, shared like the stash among any and all vendors you place. I don't think they'll put a price limit beyond something ludicrous (like 10k caps or higher or something), if that.
---
Excavator armor can't be mixed without losing the weight bonuses.  No-bueno.
---
Any weapon you cannot wear in power armor is an unarmed weapon, the only card set directed at a damage increase for 'unarmed' class is Iron Fists. Iron Fists directly benefits Mole Miner Gauntlets, Death Claw Gauntlets, Knuckles, and Death Tambos. While bare fists do NOT benefit from  Incisor and Martial artist perks, unarmed weapons do benefit. You can also benefit from Talons and Twisted Muscles mutations. 'unarmed weapons' are not boosted by one-handed melee weapon perks - such as gladiator.
---
Yeah if i lose em it'll take a damn good thing to replace em theyre my best+favorite weapons
---
I proposed this workaround if you don't mind me piggy backing the popularity of your post.
---
The post's TL;DR: While we wait for them to fix it (or instead of if they can't). Lets us "boil" purified water for cooking since sometimes its easier to get purified water than boiled.
---
P.S. I found out on mine that if you drink from the pump first, you can quickly spam collect and get about 10 waters quickly. The downside is dad's and diseases but if you dont have the radaway debug its not that bad.

If I get more .38 I'll be shitting since I dont use it.
---
Heard some Beach Boys today... Is that new?  
---
Just like human employees! 
---
They would have to nerf melee cause as well, cause that's op too, now this is just getting silly. Not to mention bloodied explosive can be more powerful then tse.

Lvl 82 still using quest reward items
---
I would argue that Junk Piles are the most valuable.
---
They provide several rare materials at once: Screws, Springs, Crystals, and Ballistic Fibers.
---
If you have a mobile camp, you can just focus on materials that you're low on and move when you have enough.
---
I'd agree with that, but the current system would ironically need a complete workaround to make that properly function. As it stands, you need 12 of a SPECIAL stat to just get the basic essentials for some builds, like 3x rifleman and tank killer. Even if you max yourself out at 15 and leave other stats deficient, you don't have enough room for anything extra. The perk for damage against glowing enemies is nice - that puts you at 15. Even if you wanted some QoL perks at 1 each, you wouldn't be able to take a single one. Lockpicking will require that you switch out your perks every single time you want to pick a lock. Strength and luck also have a ton of necessary perks like that. Imo instead of trying to get some convoluted mess where it's a balance of sacrifices, it would be much easier to have different sets for different purposes. It makes more sense to decide whether you want to decrease the weight of all your chems or all your junk rather than whether you want to decrease the weight of chems or increase the damage of the gun you will be constantly using
---
Out of game intoxicated. Though usually in game also the extra small carry weight is nice. 
---
The people who duped will be taking the vast majority of the best gear for a very long time. They will be wrecking the coming PVP game mode they announced... You can argue it wasn't bethesdas intention to create such an mass market economy but it still exists with reddit/discord. You are speculating about the future when the game is broken now.
---
There is a reason other multiplayer games hotfix this shit instantly, it breaks the game. Watch and learn what happens when a company chooses to let a dupe exist for weeks with zero action.
---
And scaleskin should add scales. 
---
I missed that somehow. Sorry. So that's fair then. 
---
Bloodied is a first slot legendary. The suggestion I made is to move explosive to be a first slot legendary as well.
---
To add to this, players who have bought items that were duped have no way of knowing and innocent people would be banned.

My storage mule is over 40k weight.

I'd be happy if they just wiped everyone's items once they put in the tools to track dupers... and implement vendors and such. After all its a fallout game, we will all just keep gathering anyways and fill our stash boxes fast once again. 
---
Some time in January, probably mid month based on previous patches. One week of "Here is our general plans" one week of "here's the patch notes" and release.
---
Increasing the resources to repair things doesn't fix anything, if anything it overall hurts the game.  The avg Joe that plays the game will now have to grind even more.  The Ang Joe doesn't know he can go buy junk off a subreddit.

Honestly i think that song is so singable in fo76 because it’s one of the only ones whose vocals don’t sound like they were recorded from one end of a tin can telephone. I dig all the music, but the production quality on this one is definitely higher than most, if not all of the other songs.

Also - would it be possible to add self-closing doors to our CAMP crafting selections?  The kind like you already have in Whitespring would be fine.  Apparently, all of my teammates were born in a barn.  They NEVER shut the doors to my camp.  Drives.  Me.  Insane.
---
Just 
---
You assume I speculating about the future of the game. I could have inside information.
---
Secondly if they nerf TSE Weapons...How will people who have gun builds compete against 2k Melee dps builds? In games like this it’s hard to balance everything.
---
The perk card lowers the cost back down.
---
Sure as hell not how it's supposed to work.  Someone with a bounty is supposed to be an allowed kill and not give you a bounty unless you like shot up his place in the process I suppose.  Based on some reddit posts though I question whether the system is always working properly.
---
you think increasing resource cost will hurt dupers? are you serious? that will help dupers by increasing the value of their duped items
---
I could take starched genes lvl 2 and class freak lvl 3 in place of my currently luck stats and they would fit perfect without anything else, question is, are mutations worth it at 75% reduced negatives. would it have the potential to say, even reduce perception by 1 and make it were I cannot use a perk card? I'm not too familiar with the mutations honestly.
---
There unfortunately isn’t a way to choose which mutations you get rid of. If you’re trying to buy as few mutations as possible and save some caps, then continue what you’re doing - farm as many mutations as possible, then start taking Rad-X one at a time while carefully noting which mutations it is curing. Once you get rid of the ones you don’t want to keep, consider whether you’ve managed to keep enough of the “good” mutations. If you haven’t, farm again and repeat. If you have kept enough of the mutations, lock them onto your character with level 2 Starched Genes perk and buy the remaining mutations you want. I would recommend buying them directly from other players, they can be 75 - 90 percent off the asking price compared to the vendors in the servers. In fact, if you’re on X-box PM me and I’ll give you my gamer tag. I’ll give you a discount on whatever extra serums I have - I have a few extras of varying types laying around. Happy gaming!

That is so true. Energy weapons break so easy in Fallout 76. 
---
Hi mate, I learnt a few days ago it's a visual glitch.  Exit and re-enter the trade screen a few times and the caps will change.
---
I usually plant corn and tatos for AP benefits [Tato juice and Corn soup]. Melons are good too for the passive health regen [Melon soup]. If you live out in the Bog then Diseased Cranberries are plentiful for Cranberry juice which gives bonus xp. Another is Cranberry Jam which needs carrot flowers and I think sugar and gives damage resistance. Carrot flowers can’t be planted though. Those are all my go-tos.
---
Yeah, just hit 100 today. Would have quit around level 80ish, but to get the platinum trophy (ps4), had to make it to 100. Those last twenty or so levels were painfully boring. 
---
Best part of this game is the exploration. Leveling and story is pretty fun too. Once you complete those things, it's hard to justify playing. It's not even fun or challenging to play with friends, and with the way the xp is distributed, it's counterproductive to 'help' your teammates.

Sleepy me reading the title: "What is a death bug?"
---
Omg thank you for this!!!!!!!!! So helpful!
---
You can make over 5k caps/day, plenty of people have reached 25k+ caps completely legitimately.
---
Even when just farming (without capping on all 5 mules) I'm making over 1k/day.
---
1/3rd of 1 day to cap is not a solution.
---
Mind you GTA Vs system is still faulty af. Hackers are rampant there and I've had my account money dropped a few times and not once has it ever been flagged or taken down or reverted  let's not forget bethesdas engine is as old as the hills :/
---
System: Xbox One S
---
Problem: Selecting/manipulating items causes the game to crash to the home screen. This isn’t just at C.A.M.P., but likely at any stash. (The same thing happened at the vendor stash.) This seems to only occur when selecting legendary items. 
---
This sometimes happens when highlighting legendaries in my own inventory as well, but it isn’t clear whether that is related to this.
---
[I recorded a video, here. ](https://youtu.be/t7SVlSMmQ9Q) 
---
It’s definitely a really bad glitch. You are supposed to receive the 400 caps not have the bounty transferred onto you. I am amazed at how bug ridden this game is. 
---
This is hilarious!

The arms retain their ore mining bonuses.

Yeah he has the super sledge and shishkebab which piqued my interest. A bunch of others too.

I have seen him 6 or 7 times now, I'm level 40ish.

I've spent over 500 hours grinding in this game, unless they plan to pay me for those 500 hours there's no way I could accept a reset.

I've had a few similar glitches when entering areas.  I've also had weird glitches where certain surfaces of rocks displayed pink with an error message.
---
I have 66 cores so this perk is a must have
---
nerfing explosive weapons doesn't matter to dupers, they duped every decent combo of weapons
---
as for your "inside info", no offense, but it is desperate
---
They could make it where the items in the vending machines still counted as STASH items.  TBH I kinda assumed this is how it would be, although I have absolutely nothing to base that on.
---
https://gyazo.com/4e00eb19900bbd9cc40d5281b7d16696 got this day 4 of the beta, have used it to level 4 charas so far, once i hit level 15 it doesnt take long
---
I see
---
still tse, still isnt end all, melee can take out queen in 10sec or less after she lands. Tse is a nice balance of range and dmg. Pvp on the other hand, needs balancing big time.
---
Bought junk could be automatically placed in customer's stash, neutral area sounds like a good idea too. Selling items could probably take up space in stash until it gets bought.
---
I’m not missing your point. Even Casuals watch YouTube video game Tutorials. Or watch Twitch. The odds of a casual not using YouTube or twitch or a gaming website at all. Is so small remote that it’s a statical out lier.
---
You seem to miss the point you don’t think behind the scenes Bethesda isn’t working on a way to track dupers. How many characters they have and how much Inventory they have on Said Characters.
---
Just because you don’t see results yet doesn’t mean it isn’t happening.
---
I also said a short term adjustment to Repair costs.
---
Yeah I agree with the guy who you replied to. Just because it is multilayer doesn't mean it automatically has to have PVP.
---
Heck I don't even mind the PVP events or the PVP aspect of taking over workshops but here I am trying to follow the storyline and some level 200 who is bored with the poor after endgame game play is blasting my base to pieces with his belt fed grenade launcher and must just accept it because his experience is "valid"? 
---
your right, bethesda can do things to help the market. people arent seeing that. and just wanna say thank god your not posting another of the 1,000s of posts saying “bethesda do _____ to dupers or _____ to duped items”
---
Yeah it's not getting fixed today, they likely opened a ticket and that's it. This game is quickly losing ground with me.
---
Yes, how dare people buy a game and play it through to the end?
---
I don't mind. I didn't even think my post would be this popular
---
"They nerfed stealth!?!"
---
I agree..I was speaking to those who scream nerf TSE Weapons at the end of my OP.
---
I almost wonder if this is just an excuse to stop people from easily farming the SBQ with their overly abundant TSE weapons while they attempt to find a fix to bring the game into some kind of balance.
---
Somehow I’ve only seen him once and I’m level 93. Lol

Wow I completely forgot sloths were in this game, even though they were in the trailer. I maybe saw them once in the beta lol and not since.

Space suit at crashed space station is 300 cap value. Not sure what it sells for. 
---
Imma fix that. Thank you!
---
Oh yeah, those melee tanks are awe inspiring to watch, haha. An idea like the one I gave would hopefully make other ranged builds more viable end game wise, because all of those explosions become annoying.
---
PVP is a mess, but I wouldn't be surprised if they never get it tuned right without separate servers.

As for inside info I do have some. The first Raid will be 4 people. If you die in the raid your done and your team carries on with out you. If all 4 people die the raid is done. There will be a couple of puzzles 3 Mini Bosses and 1 Main boss. Is the currant plan of the raid design.
---
Jeez the damage on that thing! 
---
I just had to hop servers twice because of the controls disabled message, and was disconnected from a third. 
---
If you don't understand how dupers will ruin the game, let me explain it...
---
You didn't dupe, you want an item, you don't get it because you are trading against people who want items and have hundreds of TSE weapons/godrolls.
---
When you were farming, they were duping, for every decent average item they got a hundred godrolls duped. So really you just have to find your loot naturally, and you will be competing against these people in the coming PVP events and you will be getting wrecked.
---
This can't be fixed. The economy is already broken at least until the next tier of items. Have a nice day.
---
Nukes are bugged at the moment hotfix coming tomorrow 
---
Thank you.
---
Dude way to carelessly put your dirty ass sweaty ass cheese crusted PA fucking leg in our stew. 
---
Also I don't think that your production extractors actively produce during a defense event.  I might have just been getting the invisible over world inventory glitch though not sure.
---
And i'm soo sorry my friend.
---
Nuke silos are borked at the moment. Hotfix promised soon.
---
This is a common issue I've seen. Either some enemies are well hidden (the scorched like to play dead in those greenhouses and up on the top floors) or they spawned underground and you can never ever kill them. 
---
I hope thats what became of the two Yao Guai that fucking mauled me today 
---
I didnt know the gun was loaded
---
I have connectivity issues on XB1 even with high end internet. It’s the usual hourly server crash which makes workshops not really worth taking due to the risk of not having collected any resources by the time the server crashes, due to not having headed back to the workshop to retrieve them. However people - imo - are exaggerating the crashes a bit, yeah they are common, yeah they are obnoxious, but they sure aren’t totally game breaking. It takes me at max 1-2 minutes to log back in. It’s at most a minor inconvenience to experience the hourly server shutdowns.
---
New vaults opening would be a good opportunity to throw in some human npcs and populate the game. 
---
Where was his life bar? Just watched again and still didn't see it.
---
Awesome stuff saved
---
I don’t PVP. So I can’t speak to the PVP side of things. I don’t view or take Fallout76 as a true PVP game. But Bethesda can create a PVP mode where you don’t bring weapons in. Like A battle royal game. You have to use the weapons you find and when kill a enemy loot there weapon. Easily Fixed.
---
Hey thanks, I'll check that out.
---
I tried going into one, and it won't read my hand on the scanner. Is that what's going on??
---
Definitely appears to be bugged. I’ve done the keycard mission twice, and my quest marker just keeps pointing at the surveillance system terminal and the only option is to track more drones to get keycards. 
---
I can’t access the silos themselves either. 
---
There's a button to inspect items in your inventory. There's not normally any reason to use it, but it brings up a full picture and a full description.
---
Two Shot on a shot gun is pointless. It only fires one extra pellet.
---
I'm in Australia, so maybe that hinders the server connection.
---
Generally in an average of 5 hours play, I'll lose server connection maybe 3 times.
---
It's not *unplayable*, but it makes it tedious when you're halfway through something, 6-7 enemies spawn, and suddenly the frame rate dies in the arse, it freezes for 30 seconds and then BAM, main menu. :(
---
So it's better if I do it from a river or lake. Good to know. Thanks.
---
I’ve been using discord with my friends and you can sync up to what one of you is listening to on Spotify. I played that fallout Christmas playlist all last month and had it synced with my friend! 
---
no seriously, thank you. its a nice change of pace and i hope more of the community start to take notice and understand this 
---
This makes me feel like I have a super power lol
---
Ah, gotcha. I’ll add a /s in that case lmao
---
Let's call them The Last Minute Gun*, LOL
---
Would you be willing to franchise? As in we make the same place for multiple servers so it's not just in one place?
---
At the top of the screen right after you turned pacifist mode off you hit him and it went down a bit as much as it should go down in non engaged combat 
---
but it still isn't fixed
---
they have sentinel armor, full set, duped
---
they take 5% damage when you take 100%
---
Yes nukes are bugged in several ways. Hotfix is planned for tomorrow 
---
oh, had no idea. thanks for the info.
---
Yeah, I got the game on Christmas and I’m level 35 and at the moment I love the game, there’s just too many bugs that they need to fix.
---
This game is a good improvement from fallout 4 too I’m just hoping they’ll focus on the bugs and making the game even better.
---
Sweet, not on tonight, watching a movie, but will be on most of tomorrow :)
---
Wow, so they know they are both directly and i directly ruining everyone's came play. Directly with lag, indirectly with the economy. I hope they all burn in hell. Would love to see a Bethesda franchise-wide permaban for them but I know that won't happen. Nothing is too big a punishment for them.
---
no seriously, thank you. its something i hope more of the community start to take notice and understand because its becoming pretty toxic
---
Let us go to an alien home world please, set it in the far future and make it require a time travel device. 
---
That same device could pave the way for limitless dlc and allow fo76 to become the largest fo to date.
---
Yep, occasionally they spawn an absurd distance away as well.  I always wonder if they occasionally get distracted and go after another mob.
---
Where did you find the plans for it? 
---
Maybe you don’t come in with armor either?
---
Same. But tbh, I don’t think perception does much anymore. My perception is maxed at 15 and the VATS range is nonexistent and my radar doesn’t show enemy icons even when they’re right in front of me. What else is it good for if not those two things?
---
I don't think they are related at all in any form what so ever. I'm curious of how you put that together.
---
i am level 5 now and Flatwoods is as far as i've been. An yes, please...even though i have no fcking idea what that is, ban them all!
---
I had zero issues doing it.
---
Actually that's a lie. I had constant CTD on one part of the use transponder to find Taggarts body quest. But the rewards for completing it are worth it. 
---
the point you missed is that you are wrong and being a jerk rofl
---
you reach so hard for an answer that isn't ever going to be a reality
---
they could also fix it with a reset, it just isn't going to happen man
---
its already broken
---
I had so much .45 ammo laying around I don't even need the mod
---
There is a grid. The one used for targeting nukes. We should just use that one.
---
Well I know they wasn’t trying to create an actually Economy when there wasn’t a trade house or Trade board. Like ESO or other MMO’s.
---
That's a common one from Customer service in a game like this, or just CS in general. I would be willing to bet my entire savings that they can manipulate stuff on a client level. But can you imagine how many cases they would have to deal with if they opened those doors? "HURR DURR my (insert item) disappeared, this game is trash HALP" and the mountains of work it would take for them to sort through and manage that just to find the legitimate cases with a team that obviously wasn't staffed enough to handle that amount of work. Sometimes it's better to say you can't do something with an autoreply than to open that floodgate clusterfuck.
---
I’m sorry I got it mixed up I thought the bandolier perk was the one were you take 15% less damage when standing still 
---
I'm on Ps4 and my invites seem broken. Yesterday I guess a couple of people sent invites but I didn't see the requests. I just got a pop up that said I had denied a team invitation or something. 
---
Would you prefer "it's crap" instead? Inexcusable for a $60 dollar game from a company with a history of popular games?  Unbelievable. Shockingly devoid of a critical feature.  Pro tip: adults use those nasty curse words all the time, because they're words.  One of the greatest words in English is fuck, hands down, no debate. And somewhere in the top ten is "sucks". 
---
Cooking with purified water should produce a ‘clean’ rad-free variant.
---
I hear ya being annoying, people with tse desperately trying to mow down everything before anyone can tag. Exactly why I carry a non explosive weapon for tagging so when I find a respectful whitespring group, we can share loot.  
---
I would assume as long as your not moving it works
---
Ok
---
All 3 have different launch codes and they all change weekly 
---
Indeed.
---
wItHoUt NpCs ThErE's No StOrY!
---
The problem is not no NPC's, it's the lack of player agency and the illusion of choice. And to be honest, that's not a problem if you don't blatantly assume fallout = RPG. They already said this is not a main game entry. Assuming they don't collapse in the next 3-5 years, we're getting Fallout 5. This is not Fallout 5. This is Fallout: Multiplayer Experiment 1.
---
I *greatly* prefer the 76 model of storytelling. Goes at my own place, don't have to hit dialogue trees to advance the story. I can pop on the holotape and do something while I learn more about the world. Would it work in an RPG? Hell no. Good thing this isn't an RPG.
---
I got mine with the quest for the kidnapped kid
---
I’d love it if they did but I don’t think they’d want to lose that much money. Those duper’s probably play more than the average player. Still though everyone who clearly duped should at least have their inventory scrubbed. But ban seems too harsh considering just how easy it was/is to dupe.
---
Exactly this. If I know I'm alone I'll use my TSE, but the second I see others I pull out my Perfect Storm to tag enemies only.
---
They specified that was coming up during their end of the year post.
---
Oh ok. I'll work on other quests in the mean time. Anyone want to blow up the Fissure Prime with me, when it's back up?
---
Why are you even on this sub at this point? They mean enough for you to use them when you feel upset or am I wrong? You didn't say some. You said I. That's not a feature. Crafting enough of a single item till the game doesn't know what to do anymore is not a feature, it's an exploit. The same can be said about any other game and it's all hindsight for them at this point. I'm not wasting my time with this pointless conversation. You should really look into things before you act high and mighty bud. 
---
well, I dont do any trading, except for a few items, and the items that I have gotten havent been duped, as far as I know, mainly because they're not usually high traffick items, and the TSE's that I have (I have a shotgun, and a tesla rifle) definitely havn't been traded for, as I've only ever killed enemies for them, so unless that one person who duped it 10000 times has some way to put it into the loot tables and force it to drop after literally hundreds of times of killing legendary enemies... then no, I dont have any duped weapons, guess what? not every TSE is duped.
---
The trade stealing was just people looking for handouts.
---
Yes this.... Perhaps Star bottle caps? sunset sasparilla ?. 
---
Faction specific currency like how you earn theme park tokens limited to X amount per day to buy that special outfit. 
---
BoS trade in 50 of X currency earnt from BoS events to buy X weapon/armour.
---
Enclave trade in 50 of X currency earnt from Enclave events to buy X weapon/armour.
---
Hence why if i spot someone whose camped 3 or 4 workshops nearby me ill target them. Do you really wanna lose the munitions factory and 2 junkyards? 
---
&gt;For some reason that Excavator glitch backfired on me and I lack any carry weight bonus from the armor half the time.
---
My X-01 Hydralic Bracers say they give me +15 Str ( Unarmed hitting damage is what it's supposed to give) I've got like a net negative 12 or more ( Bird Bones, Egg Head, Eagle Eye) so I can't tell if it's true or not.
---
&gt;But that glitch is capped at 100lbs which is not going to cause problems like everyone in your server having unlimited weight all the time
---
Yea for sure I was just letting you know Weight Glitches were still around, I don't use them because with "Light as a Feather" for Pistols+Ammo/Food Reduction Armor without exploiting  I'm already running into server problems like the entire game freezing when I try to use my stash Box
---
Yes, but do I need to the actual codes to enter the silo? Trying to just skip that process and look on here for the new codes to launch another one.
---
Also dwellers that come from an even numbered vault can only use their water purifiers on Sunday.
---
1&gt;xbone
---
2&gt;Beelzebubba13
---
3&gt;none
---
4&gt;I've been disconnected half a dozen times or more tonight sometimes its like a hard freeze, and sometimes thd thing just shits hard and kicks me back to the please stand by screen like i just booted the game. On one unfortunate reboot I was dumping some weight on a supermutant corpse and I accidentally dropped my somersett special into his inventory right as the game tanked. Lost my favorite gun. I enjoy this game, but the disconnects are killing me. Please, for the love of god, fix the issues with disconnects. 
---
&gt;no ticket
---
A thanks man. Now I don’t have to think about that. 
---
Ffs, vats uses more power? Is AP directly related to power use?
---
Good chance that’s what the new vaults opening up is, if they’re smart about it that is.
---
No you never need the codes to get in you can enter them whenever you want 
---
Hilariously, yes, legendary drills exist. 
---
As for your other questions, unfortunately I cannot answer them!
---
It doesn't start at the prison, it starts in a few places, I know near the space station is one.
---
You get attacked by gutsy look-alikes that drop arrest warrants that start the quest.
---
I haven't tried this but you might be able to put power armor down in front of the ledge that leads pretty much down to the boss instead of going out though the mirelurk caverns.  I use a jet pack when I'm farming and he wendigo down there
---
Big Bad John would be dope
---
Yea im curious how they will handle all that. Just because, since they are trying to fix exploits and glitches, and im sure we will see more pop up as time guess on.. I could see people overloading stashes by buying stuff, and having it go into a already full stash. Or if its for sale in machine, but kept in stash, some new dupe glitch. 
---
Uhmmm okay? Yeah but you were talking about giant updates... We haven't had giant updates post launch. Which usually happens at launch. 1gig is not a large update by any means. You saying one thing doesn't make it true. 
---
Currently, the silos are bugged but Bethesda said there will be a hotfix tomorrow. In regards to launching multiple nukes, I personally didn't complete any of the codes and instead just took the keycard from a cargobot and used the code found on Nukacrypt to launch it. The codes are universal throughout Fallout and will work on any server but are specific to their silo for each week (the codes change each Tuesday?).
---
No matter what I say you already have it in your mind that game is Damage forever. Which is a common thing amongst gamers these days. They are impatient and live in the moment. They over reacted  and don’t give time for things to be corrected or a resolution to run its natural course. Most Gamer live in the here and now.
---
I’m 53 played Video ever since they existed. Played FPS,RPGS and MMOs. These thing happen and they are always fixed or a solution and a resolution is reached. THE GAME ISNT EVEN 2 months old and so many scream the game ruin forever shut the servers done..
---
Be Patient..
---
As I go riding merrily along!
---
Do you know what this guys gamertag is?
---
Well I think one of the worst parts from the community, the YouTubers specifically, called out a bunch of "changes" that weren't listed in patch not and then people reported it happening before the patch went into effect. And then a few YouTubers swearing that people like us, those who enjoy the game for what it is, are just trying to justify their money spent and won't take no for an answer to it. Personally I love the game. Yeah their are some issues but, I still enjoy playing it regardless so even though I paid full price, I feel I've gotten my money's worth.
---
I never said dupers aren't an issue. Not once did I even infer that. I personally don't care about them because in the rare event that I actually come across another player, it's pretty unlikely that they're gonna be a duper. I don't care about the economy, again this is me personally, and I don't care if people have nicer weapons than me. I'm here for the experience/fun not to be the absolute best. I imagine plenty of players are of this mindset. 
---
We don't even know what the PVP events will be. Why are you trying to be upset about it before you even know what's up? This is my point exactly. You're *trying* to be upset. You can't even stay on topic, a topic which has plenty of valid and *current* issues to be discussed, without going off into imagination land and making up new things to be mad about. 
---
It can be fixed. It's a *game*. You even mentioned one pretty simple fix in your own reply. 
---
You have a nice day as well! 
---
Okay, I wasn't crazy about SoaS missing.
---
Totally missed the whole bug situation, but thanks! 
---
Gather water from a creek, stream, pond, lame.. spam gather and gain 100 lbs really quick. I think this will help and I see that you say you gather it from a pump at your place.. but that's your choice. Work smarter not harder. 😘
---
PS4 here same thing experienced a lot less disconnects after dropping all my notes and holotapes.
---
Currently it says they are bugged, 1/1/19. But one of them just works? Does that mean in can just go in with a keycard and pick a spot?
---
Come on, get with the program noob!
---
They are def broken.  I still haven’t gotten credit for visiting cranberry glade despite me taking a pic in front of the billboard sign
---
Perception doesn't do what it says it does, from what I've seen. 
---
I've had perception kick in only *once* warning me about something. And that was about a bomb on the body in...huntington? I don't remember, but I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. 
---
The radar thing, I'd have to test this, but it might *only* be for once engaged. I can't test this though, as I don't have a character with 1 perception. I thought perhaps it lets us either see that or see it from a longer distance etc. 
---
VATs range is pretty garbo, I don't know if the range got better but it's always fairly short. And the accuracy is is still quite bad. 
---
I might just give it up as well; however, I'd really like to be able to test it. Maybe I'll have to do some controlled pvp to test. 
---
However, missile silos are currently nonfunctional. Hotfix promised soon.
---
Haven't gotten to that point but good to know it could be easily done!
---
Nah I've had plenty of disconnections and crashes on pc.
---
Enough with the post edits.
---
I'm a terrible hoarder. Until it comes to selling stuff to others. Then I'm the richest in the land. But they usually have to come to me. I haven't been to camp in a week... My Radstag is probably getting hungry.
---
This is what I thought. It seemed weird and exploitable to me that I was able to kill one of the two, (it ended up only giving me just under 200 caps even though it said he was worth 400) then instantly get a 400 cap bounty myself which his friend collected (gotta love dem TSE)
---
Not if you have mutual friends who play together
---
I'm not on PS4 :( ... But I know how difficult that cave can be (it is one of my favorite places in the game, though), so every time I see someone inside it on my map I fast travel there to try and help. That of course spawns new enemies, but the only real threat is the Wendigo, so it's better to attack him in group.
---
I had soooo many little storyline or unique trinkets/weapons meticulously placed all over my house in Megaton, I know it may not be feasible since it’s technically dropping the item, but I really wish I could do the same in this game. There’s very little in the way of true customizing, or keeping trophies from certain quests, when you’re stuck with that limit while also needing to stock up on junk items in order to build shit you need.
---
I do like the idea of it at workshops, but then the question arises, what about a server dc or someone takes it over. As u lose what you built at workshop.. And i see posts about people randomly destroying bases as it is now for no reason. Building a more open/convenient base, and someone not liking your prices, could promote more people to do so... 
---
I won't be making money anymore. Sure my chems are cheap but are they gonna be 1 cap for five stimpacks cheap? Fuck no, but thank god the fucking dupers are there to save the day!
---
To be honest, without the disclaimer, I wouldn't see it as a joke either.
---
Give it to me, and I can troll this guy like he has never seen before.
---
North Korea hack the game
---
I’d always travel back to Vault 76 if I was desperate enough. Lotta dogs in that area. You might have just been better waiting it out at CAMP. From what I understand, you actually don’t die from starvation or dehydration. Just get debuffs
---
I had a set of PA disappear for a week and then it just showed up lol
---
I'm setting at about the same and I personally do not consider a 4.2 GB update big by any means unless you survive on mobile Hotspot. Hopefully the hotfix won't be large at most 10 GB I can understand completely if it's 40 or something insane like that. Like I said previously Cod and other large companies can give people 4 50Gig updates (just weapon skins or a broken/blatant copy of the new big thing [looking at you fork knife] "battle pass" style system) in a months time and Noone loses their mind. 
---
** notice refreshing worlds will be back up shortly **
---
Watoga super duper mart's BOS vendor. It takes an insane amount of relogging. 10/10 would never do again. 
---
I would use all my atoms to buy a NCR Ranger outfit
---
Id suggest whitesprings. Theres no other better place than whitesprings nuked. Put on passive, have lots of mollys, toss into group to ensure you tag all and collect. Make sure if its legendary but does not drop a legendary weapon you press R, sometimes it will show up there. 
---
Otherwise farm caps and buy from someone on the market. Buying is the best sure proof way, but the best way to farm caps (aside from daily selling and alt daily selling) is selling what you dont need from nuked whitesprings lol.
---
You heal from diseases after a short amount of time. I remember when I first started and I had dysentery. I was going through so much water that I didn’t have, I drank out of rivers and lakes and got rads I couldn’t heal. It’s a small hump but you make it over it quickly! 
---
You can eat a lot of stuff, just collect stuff whenever you see it. It will go bad eventually, but if you have a disease that’s making your food levels go down then just keep eating random food. It’ll go away quickly, or you can search fumed boxes for disease cure or antibiotics to get rid of them. 
---
Oh dude I totally get you on the paint thing. I simply cannot use armor sets that don't look good as a set.
---
The closest option for ultracite was the blackbird X01 which I didn't get when I had the chance. 
---
I didn't say the damage is forever, it will last beyond the next tier of items though as dupers will still have a huge cap/resource advantage. 
---
This is a huge problem, and it should have been hotfixed... but somewhere someone weighed the pros and cons and chose not to. That is a very bad sign, they chose not to incur the cost to hotfix this dupe even with the damage it will do. Give that some thought.
---
They use boiled water because purified water is a medical based ingredient. Why would you trust contaminated boiled water to be used in the creation of medical items.you'd then have to have radiation inheritance in your diluted or radified mentats.. oh wait.. they did and it's called Daytripper.
---
Chainsaw is only found. Need a perk to make them do any damage atm. But it's not permanent.
---
Not really hadnt thought of it...for once I was having fun.
---
Whitesprings nuked is still the best. Just gotta play that RNG and hope you win that lottery. Or save up around 5-7k caps and buy one from someone 
---
Add the one song from fallout 3.  No place like home. And more songs from fo3.
---
Yep AP use drains the core. Even if you spam vats with no targets around. 
---
Thank you, I thought it looked odd. Oh well
---
WHERE
---
Oh god the resort....
---
There's actually two recipes. One that uses coal and the other glowing mushrooms (they both use cloth and bleached dogwood), the difference is whether you make them at a cooking station or a chemistry station.
---
First perk card I took was luck, and got Pharma Farma. Hope it was the right choice. I'm brand new to 76.
---
To be honest, I have no love for the Brotherhood, not even enough to find out why they got shoehorned into this game (other than to please bos fanboys).
---
That said, as a military vet, I can assure you that sleeping in power armor is something US soldiers would be more than capable of doing if they felt their life depended on it. I've seriously seen servicemen sleeping in even the most hostile situations in very strange positions on uncomfortable surfaces... Whatever is necessary. If I saw beasts spewing gas, and had access to a sealed suit capable of protecting the wearer from the severe radiation they'd been facing in the years since the bombs fell, I'd climb in and wouldn't get out without a damn good reason.
---
Considering reddit name, Ironic
---
Considering a group of hte fanbase, Not ironic.
---
Handmade Rifle. It's got the fire rate of an assault rifle and the damage of a combat rifle. It's the best semiauto rifle in the game, far as I know. If I can get one with Two Shot, it would basically become my primary weapon, with maybe my TS Dragon for opening sneak attacks.
---
Found one today there as well.  Was thinking it was just a myth like the supposed jetpqck.
---
I probably could have worded that a little better
---
Post like this are the reason I keep wrecking CAMPs.
---
For the weapon or mods? I just fond the weapon plans, i just really need the mod plans now
---
Did you hit X or.. whatever the button for computer "Transfer" is?  
---
Sometimes it wont pop up on the quick display
---
They should just remove TSE from the game.
---
I've gone back to find and do all the quests and etc I missed while I was blitzing through the main story. 
---
oh lmao didnt even notice till now =P
---
What a stupid people work at Bethesda! They don't understand that I should be invincible or I'm gonna cry on reddit.
---
You win the gold star. We should be friends. This arguement is basically complaining about complaining at this point lol.... he is probably one of those guys that complains about having to reload a 6 shooter revolver but only uses 6 shooters because he has a wild west outfit from the Atomic store. 😆
---
Yep its in the atomic shop now.
---
And what, is Bethesda going to UNDO the effects of the nuka quantums you already drank?
---
That would break lore
---
Im the last of my friends that play 76, one left because some other game came out, 1 cause he got grieved...idk how. And 3 because they couldnt play for more than an hour or two. But hey it may just be my friends and I.
---
 When using the Surveillance System Terminal I'm only seeing the "Initiate Search" option for the Nuclear Keycard Escort but do not see any options for location Silo Code Pieces for the quest  **"I am Become Death"** . My friends and I have already collected the Keycard multiple times without being able to see the other options. Logging in and out again doesn't seem to have worked. Thoughts? Any help appreciated. PS4.
---
disease cures are easy to make and i believe you start off with the recipe theres an area south east of vault 76 right past the river before the railroad that you can get firecap and follow the river south to find a ton of the snaptail reeds and bloodleaf and u wont ever need to worry bout diseases again... i have over 60 in my stash lol
---
Thanks I'll check back throughout the week
---
Was gonna offer as well. Cheers to you for your good intentions.
---
If you run into invisible enemies, linger in the area it and should give quest markers for where they supposedly are - I was able to lob grenades at the spot where the map markers said they were and killed them. I assume they were spawned in underground or something.
---
It’s not a glitch or a bug. If you DROP your power armor, anyone can get in it. You have to place your power armor properly for it to be assigned to you.
---
Thanks I found it finally!  turns out there's 2 conduit items, pipes are under the second one.
---
They down voted you because you make too much sense... or because they are 12 and have never been camping. I dunno. Upvote!
---
I was wanting to do the actual decryption but might end up just looking at the nukacrypt 
---
I want to be BIG
---
Makes a funny taste resulting in PER -1.
---
Yeah, I managed to get a keycard by having a friend join my team.. but can't get INTO a silo now... Wtf Bethesda 
---
To limit how many you can have.
---
See I never cried that I wanted to invincible. Asking for a choice to not pvp isnt asking to be invincible. Asking for them to cater to their fans who have always bought their single player fans so they wouldn't have to do pvp isnt asking to be invincible. But your probably one of those dbags who chase people around in groups of 5 pecking at them and harassing them so this will fall on deaf ears.
---
Upvote for well thought out perk ideas that sound super OP!
---
Yeah, it turns out convenience stores and pharmacies and gun stores get robbed in real life, too. You can't completely prevent it, but you can deter it with proper defensive architecture.
---
However, the way they handle the vending machine inventory will be the biggest factor in how much I really utilize them... Without knowing exactly what they'll do, it's hard to say for sure. I just know I really, really want to open stores across the wasteland.
---
All loot in containers or enemies you have dealt enough damage to tag it will be instanced to you, anything else you see in the world is server side.
---
Hopefully that helps you 
---
Temperious  
---
From my understanding (I am by no means an expert) the mechanism of getting the server to DC the duper, also causes the server to not respond for a moment for everyone else on the server.
---
Also, Top of the World, if I recall all the plates and utensils up there in Rosie's room are plastic.
---
The acid requirement is insane!
---
Sorry, for now there's no way to sell plans. 
---
You can get a 38 receiver for the hunting rifle, i use that cause i have so much 38 ammo, not as powerful as the 308 or 50 but i keep one of each gun with switched receivers and then just rotate them.
---
It's actually a joke from the god.
---
Instigating War Drum, changed my game. Got 2
---
O well. Guess ill just keep giving it away then to lower level players 
---
**back up and running**
---
On one hand i agree. On the other hand i feel like degree markers on the compass and a grid system on the map are essential for any multiplayer games that encourage exploring with other player
---
Wizardry
---
yah really, its obvious with how the trading system works and our own cap limits. and really even with the market tanking it will recover and recover well once duping is done. and bethesda more than likely introduces higher lvl weapons and higher tear weapons perks. people just have a massive need to complain about 76 since its launch
---
Is there somewhere to get them other than the enclave bunker?   4600 is a lot of caps, unless you’re looking to buy from a duper.
---
I would argue server hoping regular white springs out produces nuked if you clear fast enough. On pc anyways, idk what the load screen times are like on console. You are going to have to be extremely lucky to find Tse but Ive legit found some nice end game things. 
---
That’s some good advice.
---
Man where’s all the PlayStation people! Lol idk what I will do if this game gets much harder than the Wendigo in that cave. 
---
Anywhere
---
1. First off its not even a quote so how did i miss quote myself?
---
2. What's this big changes = valid reviews. Lets say that the first one was a quote then i would have miss quoted but by the same standard so would you if you applied big changes = valid review being a quote. That's not hard to miss there right next to each other. Do you need glasses? Now lets address the quote and your response. I never said that a article or video is invalidated if the game hasn't has big changes i just said it felt copied and pasted. That's a even worse "misquote" then the first one.
---
3. The same applies for this i never said they are not allowed to make reviews until it is fixed just that there is no point in making a review or a rant you have already made.
---
4. No its the logic you twist and manipulate. I said the game needs to be fixed (even if i said changed early it was in in the context changed to fixed because I have made the point of it needing to be completed) not just changed. I have said lots of improvements have been made and followed up with a lot more need to be made as well. You can't just cut my logic and half and say it is mine. Then you ignore how you implied that me saying how a lot of bugs have been fixed bit more need to be made and you saying that makes it complete and reviews or other video should be made. Despite latter anoliging how many bugs are left.
---
5. While being clickbaty can be debated them circle jerking can not because just look to just as an example IGN who constantly makes reviews or articles about it for angry fans instead of making news about real gaming events instead of a buggy game being buggy. There are hardly any updates worth reviewing for the most part they just make a enemy drop more or less loot or tweak animations. Also because something reuses assets doesn't make it a copy reusing the same map or not adding in any new assets make it a copy. If the article or reviews talked about any thing other than what they have already talked about would be fine but they don't they talk about what they have already mentioned.
---
One person shoots a damn robot and the server shuts down because they keep wanting to respawn more and more robots.  
---
Ya using the over repair, bloodied build and trying to figure out what the best ripper style weapon is
---
Worst part of that for me was that they saw it coming, and could do nothing to stop it. They spent 4 years in slow decline as radiation killed them, and he was still so happy for their time together.
---
Find friends
---
Well for one, you have no idea what they have or have not actually started working on, likely they already started work last month. For two it is literally the first day of the month, you can't expect them to drop the update on us that fast, that's silly.
---
Congratz
---
Knowing that I won’t die makes me feel relieve. Imagine that while you are hungry and thirsty, you think you are gonna die but you actually never die. That stressed me out. 
---
Great job! I don’t know how accurate it is yet, but clearly you worked hard on this and it’ll definitely be helpful for new players
---
yea friend is pretty much it
---
Yeah you’d need someone you trust to pass it over 
---
I don’t know, I had many diseases for over an hour. Do they go away if I’m not playing? 
---
its mostly accurate to within a few feet at least
---
Yes that was my point seeing as I play solo since I don't even feel there's multiplayer. Even Borderlands and diablos 4-player Co-op is miles ahead of this multiplayer system
---
&gt;Continue this thread
---
Agreed - people seem surprised with how quick I can respond. The app is worth it if you can use it. 
---
Don't let me or my team catch you at it. 
---
Maybe they should add radio stations to the atomic shop. I’m just sat here with loads of atoms and nothing to spend it on that’s worth it.
---
Honestly the bugs aren’t really the issue any more, it’s the duped TSE weapons.  Getting one-shot with power armor on in pacifist mode at level 73 is getting old real fast. Tonight it happened twice while fast traveling in to sell.
---
I was showing a friend the game during beta when someone decided to attack up. I plugged my mic in (pre-PTT) and politely explained out loud about the Pacifist system, how it worked, and then let my health drop to half way so I could demonstrate how a single stimpack undid a full minute's worth of effort and ammo. All in the most polite, tour-guide-dealing-with-assholes tone I could. They gave up and left.
---
TSE? What’s that
---
A big mood.
---
It's a game breaking combination. 
---
Can confirm he in fact exists.  he showed up first try
---
Not on tonight but happy to help tomorrow or any time with a quest. PSN id is bumpngrind 
---
Yeah I also run a melee build and not being able to apply the perks that make things weigh less is soooo painful. I'll have an extremely hard time keeping my weight under 200. A lot of these would be nice to use but alas if I do use them I'm screwed.
---
I was just on a server with NO NUKE zones and it crashed while I was walking to my base. My game crashes so much it's unplayable to me at this point. It freezes when I get out of my PA every 5th time and it crashes every hour. What's the point. 
---
We tried getting in and couldn’t, now this explains it
---
They can let you refund before it bounds to your account after a few hours. Sorta like destiny
---
Actually, isn't that for when someone claims the bounty but you don't have the caps to cover it? I got mine when I demolished my friend's house for laughs (he started PVPing me, so I pulled out my TSE Shotgun and went to town, and I gave him materials to fix it), and I let him claim the bounty on me afterwards.
---
r/market76
---
Incorrect. Patch .09 was the days of the Zon. You had TheGreat\_Quarks Bow, CMBOE, and all of the 3/20/20s one could desire. Well on USEast that is- west was a wild 'white' west. Patch .10 and the Rust storm destroyed Amazons. Once they introduced runewords and the synergy system it was over for them and Paladins have rained supreme since. Yeah you can get a get Necro or Druid pub stomp up in there, but the good ol' days are just that. Old. 
---
Some of the legendary effects are truly broken.
---
Like you, I play 95% of this game solo. Which makes getting killed by a PKer using explosive+rifle damage to bypass slaps damn frustrating. 
---
I agree with everything besides 3.
---
Unless it makes it impossible to unequip any weight perk if it makes your stash over limit.
---
I’m just sitting here wondering why you capitalized the first letter of every word.
---
Correct
---
why :(
---
You will start slowly dying after quite awhile of no food and water. It wont let you fast travel because you are "taking health damage".
---
Yes, it's still ongoing.
---
[Utterly unplayable](https://i.imgur.com/IJV2AbF.png), this game is BROKEN I tell you!
---
Server hop for wendigos, there’s an almost guaranteed spawn for one at the trailer park near the water park   
---
Bit of a risky way but pick some random on your friends list, join hes game, drop it on a trash can or something, leave and join same "friend" with main. Ive done this successful three times now, but it's only a matter of time.. 
---
Good thing I'm leveling slowly and not even near current end game content.  I'll bypass the initial rush on new content lol.
---
Well fuck, I thought they just gave wood so I’ve been ignoring them 
---
Drop all holotapes and notes that you can.
---
I actually like that a lot. Make the Top of the World a neutral ground where everyone can do business despite faction.
---
I'm really curious to see how this game develops. I'm hoping that the story continues with updates. Eventually our work ends the reign of the Scorched and the world slowly comes back to life with the story developing from our actions as a player base.
---
I'm trying not to get my hopes up to much, but Bethesda had been vague enough that my imagination had taken over lol
---
Yeah for a while there it was use the carryweight exploit OR not wear PA and I'm a PA player so... (every time I died the game took off my PA and so then I was overencumbered, and couldn't spawn anywhere but Vault 76 IF I WAS LUCKY because sometimes I couldn't spawn anywhere AT ALL and had to restart the game)...
---
At this point I think Bethesda should pay some of us to write a manual on HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME despite all the fucking problems. My team and I know all the workarounds (how to get teamed up when people aren't showing up online, how to use discord so we can hear each other when the area chat is borked, how to this and how to that etc etc etc) Jesus Christ man the work we put in just to try to get some play time in, it's insane
---
Buying from people who have the schematics and can produce them
---
Or when you go to westek qnd it just throws mutants at you.
---
It says “later this month” which could be the 31st or tomorrow. 
---
&gt; Im level 325. I play most of the day everyday.
---
Theres absoloutely no way they can cater to someone of your level with future content without wiping.
---
Sweet. I’ll be getting home from work around 10pm eastern tomorrow. I may also get on in the morning some. I’ll go add you now. 
---
Nice, thanks for sharing. I’m going to check this out. I can’t count the number of times I’ve killed a beautiful fat bloated ghoul with three-star legendary on it to only loot some fusion cells or some shit.
---
No more OP than the level 20s face with levels 50+ with TSE and all the Specials/Perks. At you would be matching them there.
---
I don't have a TSE but my team mates does and he loves it. I have a One Shot Explosive and it is by far my favorite gun for mobs. For the SBQ though I break out my level 50 Anti Armour M2 .50BMG. That thing tears strips off a SBQ especially if she lands. 
---
Eh, duped explosive 2 shots would quickly kill scorchy. Sadly
---
Kind of pathetic to let a game play you like that, but whatever floats your boat.
---
I keep finding plans that I'd previously bought, and buying plans that I'd previously found. It's all a bit confusing. Don't forget that plans and recipes weigh 0.25lb, which means they take up stash space.
---
So far you can only give them away, sell them to players or dump them.
---
I know it would probably destroy the whole end game grind of the game which is most of the replay value. But I'd like to be able to tear apart legendaries for their prefixes, even if it was extremely costly and expensive + required special workbenches at your camp. Being able to reverse engineer for mods would be great, but having that extra layer off customisation and not relying on rng would be great!
---
I felt the game kinda died when they got to WoD and massivly dissapointed me with "Did we say time travel? We meant dimension hop, because writing actual time travel was too hard". Tons of polish, but it wasn't interesting story-wise and never improved. BfA was almost interesting, but as more an more story wrapups get stuffed behind dungeon gating (I don't have four WoW playing friends any more, and trying to relax and listen is impossible with speed running randos), I find I care less and less about the story. But that's just me.
---
Me too! My PSN is my reddit name. Lets game! 
---
I did finally see that he wasn't hostile for whatever reason the second time (glitch on game's part?). When you seek revenge I believe they are automatically hostile, right? I will say if you go around breaking full sets of power armor after the player has already been defeated, that's a total dick move. That bullshit cost me 2,000 caps in supplies (thank God I had most of it).
---
Maybe an event that affects everyone in the game at that time - something similar to the events from *ahem* ᶠᵒʳᵗⁿᶦᵗᵉ
---
Yeah guess ill do that then...
---
I noticed same thing with the legendary protectrons in Watoga, tested a few timea and seems legit
---
Pretty sure only the scorchbeast queen can drop them. I've also heard the enclave science lab rarely has them but I've yet to see it
---
So, 2018? ;)
---
All they would have to do to stop dupers from being able to vendor duped items to people, would be to implement a patch of some kind that stops any items before "x" date are un-vendorable. 
---
Other games have done it for various reasons. 
---
Since they've clearly sent the message that they ***\*WILL NOT\**** ban for Duping or Exploiting. 
---
Interesting will have to try that
---
Everything before an Auction House goes live would be only sellable to Robot Vendors and personal trades.  Everything after an Auction House goes live would be available on the Auction House.  Of course, it might sound easy to do, but could be extremely difficult to implement.
---
I mean they've already bleached the world of Fallout a ton already, so flying ridable dragons that spam attacks? Sure why not.
---
Just make sure you let Todd know he can monetize it by selling a Vault-Tec branded scorchbeast saddle for 6000 atoms.
---
that is only place that sells them they are super rare to show up there like very rare....and the queen can drop them as loot 
---
As a VATS-Luck-Crit build... I love em.  
---
Head Shot!   Head Shot!   Head Shot!  Just the sight of exploding green pumpkins followed by a satisfying "Grunt...sigh..." and the collapse of a slumping body.  It's the simple things in life...
---
Good point.
---
its usually 45minutes duration unless its the blight and that can be an hour -2 hours
---
&gt;Mr handy buzz axe  
---
This is how I know you're lying. ^^^^^^^^^^/s
---
This would be handy at the least, I just have a single small purifier working at my camp.  It's enough though that I don't need to boil water to drink, I just have to boil for cooking.  I feel your pain on the pump though, I trudge to a nearby stream to spam collect.
---
A side note, if you drink once then spam the collect key, you can get about 12-14 dirty water during the pump animation.  It's a handy glitch I think.
---
The two shot exploding weapons need to be got gone from this game period. They are stupid. They are annoying. They are OP and they the market is flooded with them and everyone has them. People are one shotting all the ghouls at WS during nuke runs and bringing the queen down so fast it's just pointless to go join in. They are pvp griefing people so fast it makes your head spin. Fuck those TSEs we don't need them. I have an exploding ghoul slayer's gatling gun that does enough damage for me. it doesn't need an extra projectile. 
---
Poor guy, if only crafting had the same slider moving stuff to storage and/or selling stuff does
---
Worth a try 
---
I don't even farm WS anymore tired of killing X # of 2-3* just to get 1* shit
---
Thanks, I will give it Shot!
---
There is no event. It's broken.
---
I don't know why people keep trying to theorize that there is some magic event or DLC coming up, no just the key feature of the entire game is broken and Bethesda's response is to get a fix out "tomorrow".
---
"Head... hurt..."
---
Yeah, that's fun.  At the same time that build (I have a similar pistolier) is worthless against scorchbeasts and most other tanky boss-level creatures. 
---
yea its op
---
Game is broken, Bethesda said they're releasing a patch tomorrow.
---
You don’t have to pvp to suffer from duping. I’ve been killed multiple times tonight by TSE shotguns through power armor on pacifist mode.
---
not the science lab they sell the regular chem recipes it's the same vendor that sells the serums
---
I'm on xb1 ans craft all serums. Just wanted to let you know the going rate is 500-700 per serum. 
---
30 in a special stat? You can't go above 15 so wtf
---
Sorry to hear that. I'm being vocal like I e experienced it. Sure, I've crashed/disco a few times, sometimes at really unfortunate times. But honestly, not that much. I dont use PA though, except for excavator just when I'm overweight and need to fast travel/keep adventuring. Ive got a buddy though who says its similar to your situation, he quit playing unfortunately...
---
Alts. Because even with respec options, some of them are just going to be painful and you won’t find / match gear.
---
Also, I use the planner and for most of what I want to do it’s going to be around 80-100 to finish the cards. I’ve got one character that NEARLY has the cards, but I still want some gear.
---
I also make my characters able to “pivot”, so I don’t get super bored. For instance I’ve got one built for explosives ... but also can swing to pistols and VATs if I feel like changing things up and keeping them new. Another that is shotguns and melee. A third that is heavy, melee, flamers, etc. It’s fun to do things with different gear.
---
Seneca rocks seems to be the highest point in the game.  Took a jetpack to the very top and could see forever.  Even saw a bravo flying southeast while I was up there.  Top of the world is to the south and it's lower in elevation.  The spire seems higher, but it's not something physical in game.  You just fly though it.
---
Already have myself so i can help, on PC
---
I have a better idea: you know those plans for "luggage" that cost like 500 caps and let you just use a differently skinned stashbox?
---
What if Bethesda was actually creative and allowed you to expand your stash slightly with each unique and hard to find plan!
---
I did that one twice and both times he stopped out front of the Southern Belle Motel. Super Annoying!
---
Grafton Steel works. Loot everything and kill the mutants. That's the best thing I've found. 
---
But YOU know YOU earned it.  Why care what others have?
---
Wired connection T-1000 base router and modem.
---
So I know the White Springs Mr. Handy's duplicating has been adknowledged, but the protectrons there do it too. Just an FYI
---
I'm a maschochist apparently. I keep trying for some stupid reason. Just now I was like "I think I'll try making my camp inside this wrecked monorail" and I was gathering wood when BAM disconnected. For the 3rd time in 2 hours. So I'm like fuck it. I'll go play Borderlands 2 ! A game that never disconnects me unless the internet or Steam goes out entirely.
---
Haha will-do. But I’ll need at least 10% of all future purchases - mama needs some more atoms. I spent all mine early on stupid shit and I’m sure as hell not spending real money to get more.
---
The science lab has serums and possibly their recipes, the medical wing sells chems
---
Is one the Camden whacker? I don't have the book but that'd be my only guess
---
PS4 if you need help
---
Lol.. I understand and agree... Just putting it out there for discussion. Regardless what happens with vending machines, there will always be the good and bad, and consequences. That's why i posted this, just to shoot around ideas and discuss. I also agree with the inventory management, in that depending on how they handle it, will determine how much ill use this feature. 
---
&gt;There are hardly any updates worth reviewing
---
What about that lot of improvements? Don't they merit talking about? Which would you prefer, they made loads of changes but the game is still a buggy mess so wow it must have been even worse than we thought. Or do you prefer articles about how Bethesda take one step forward and two steps back when they release new patches that make things worse? Or what about articles that just talk about the latest faux pas, if people write articles about how the entire endgame nuke system was broken over new years does that count as circlejerking or is that 'new content'? If people make articles about Bethesda teasing the player vending system without addressing duping? Is that allowed? You could write one article a day and not run out of different things to rag on and none of it would be copy paste to anyone except someone who goes 'Oh boy another negative review, must be the same stuff'.
---
You are stuck in circles. Guys they made changes. But not changes we need to talk about. But they did make lots of changes. And they need to make lots more changes. And once they make those changes we can talk about it. Maybe. If those changes make people like the game.
---
&gt;If the article or reviews talked about any thing other than what they have already talked about would be fine but they don't they talk about what they have already mentioned.
---
Just because you put everything under the blanket of 'bad review' = same talking points does not make it so. I have watched plenty of day-on-day week-on-week vids and articles that all sit down to talk about new and exciting ways that the game is bad. Just because you look at them and go 'Gee another one saying bad things just like all the rest' does not make it so. Want to see a real circlejerk? Head over to the front page of this subreddit and watch people crawl out of the woodwork to tell people that they aren't playing the game right, that current gen consoles just aren't built to run this game, that they have never seen a bug so they don;t exist. Or my personal favourite, that the datamined lootboxes were actually a Christmas freebie that was going to be given out.
---
the problem for me is that it is designed like an MMO (focusing on dull repetitive tasks and crafting/colllect recipes) with a bad design about it, plus the no really existence of classes, that allows rich alters plus the interest of mastering different aproaches...
---
I don't think it is a bug, I have the same issue. I wish they'd change it. Sometimes I get sick of headphones and would like to switch to speakers, but don't want to restart the game.
---
Definatly legit, this has happened to me several times to and can confirm when i dont 1 shot them and they regen ill get loot while another ill 1 shot and shit drops.
---
If your on Xbox ill hang on to while you switch
---
True. It’d be cool if killing a player’s scorchbeast would make you wanted, then, so they can seek vengeance. I would go John Wick on anyone who touches Scorchy.
---
this explains everything
---
Let us have Brahimin caravans that we can travel the wasteland with but also leave back at camp if we want to. Transporting around with our Brahimin caravan will mark us as a “roaming trader” on the map when people hover over our blip. 
---
If I had explosive weapons I would hunt them but I just started getting decent legendaries now that I am at lvl 73.
---
They are literly the same item with a different name.
---
Appreciate it, but I’m on PC, and people say the prices vary from platform to platform
---
I run a full endgame gunslinger build and one of my main weapons is a instigating, +50% vats crit damage black powder pistol. If you are at full health regardless if you are wearing power armor or not regardless of your level you are dead in one hit.
---
when i was a low level and with no power armor, i used to not like them too, but now i go through em very easily, level 54 melee with just standard excavator armor.
---
They dont even have a chance to damage my armor lol
---
I wonder how laggy the servers are for other people in your server... considering Bethesda feared even a 600 lb. stache limit
---
One is unique to obtain is all
---
You don't get it do you? Some of us CAN'T Fucking PLAY THE GAME. Because it's getting disconnected every fucking hour or so, and usually right when we are trying to kill the SBQ or doing a nuke run at WS or even before we get to launch the nuke, right before we put in the code. IT's really bad for me and my buddies on PC. THAT is why we BITCH about DUPING so much, because it's the dupers making the disconnects and the people buying the duped weapons are keeping the dupers in business. GET IT?
---
Just let me have fun in my own way. I like to rollplay as a super rich asshole. 
---
OG XB1... I’m poor.
---
I could link you at least 5 posts in the market sub for 500 cap serums on PC right now. Just head on over and scroll through 
---
I saw the Unstable Isotope Recipe in the Enclave Bunker. Haven’t seen any other recipes since though.
---
I really like this idea.
---
Go ahead 
---
Harpers Ferry and Watoga from what I've read.
---
I’ve heard a lot of people are dumping their duplicate plans and recipes at the Overseer’s camp in the container. It gives low-level players a high chance of finding them by chance and you don’t have to hunt down individual players to hand them over to.
---
I don't think my settlement has had an actual attack other than things spawning for the regular spawn NEXT to my camp, which frequently attack my base but would die real fast anyway. Maybe I never got it because they die too fast?
---
The holotape from the young boy who said he was bad and thats why his dad left but hes been good and he can come home now. That shit hurts to think about how he's blaming himself and it's tearing him up.
---
They have tried to hotfix the duping 3 times already.
---
Also we do not How easy it is to patch something on their engine. Secondly when it come to server based games sometimes it’s harder to patch and hit fix then others.
---
We do not know all the facts. Yet you make it out to be Bethesda is endorsing and tweeting out how to dupe.
---
Awesome! 
---
That’s facts. Bound to happen at some point.
---
I've found some alien blaster ammo, and there are loading screen tips about the alien blaster, so they must be somewhere in the game.
---
I agree.
---
Gimme more fucking fans for screws!!  Gah!  I find clipboards and pens out the ass though for springs and I've got over 300 gears in my stash at the moment.  Adjustable wrenches are everywhere for gears.
---
Because they can be sold to vendors and slight realism, even though they weigh as much as a Bobby pin
---
Advanced Power Connectors plan (sold by Grahm) have wall pass through conduits. 
---
They were at a reasonable price, 3 different outfits with a matching hat for 800 atom. I bought atom just yesterday because I highly approved of their new item pricing.
---
I do think they're sitting back and laughing because they haven't addressed anything of substance so far.
---
The communication/PR has been a complete joke. This is not just one or two small mistakes, its releasing a game in alpha state, not having stable servers and glaring bugs, lying about the game while marketing it ("16x the detail") and then taking weeks to do fuck all about it.
---
The game didn't come out yesterday, **it came out SIX weeks ago.**
---
Right now nukes/silos/fissures are all broken, which is one of the key elements of the game and the best Bethesda can do is a patch "tomorrow".
---
So sorry, but fuck Bethesda. Don't know why you're being sympathetic to them because this was a quick cash grab and released in a totally unforgivable state.
---
I have had the same problem with the stash box.
---
&gt;I don't understand how having no NPCs makes the game meaningless
---
Sure, if you want a soulless grindbox. Where is the emotional investment in the story. Which dead bodies by the wayside do you care about while shooting the next Scorchbeast? Who are you saving, and from what grisly fate? What would happen if you simply weren't there? Who would suffer and why do we care about them?
---
I was surprised at the lack of challenge they presented. They were always fairly low level and easy prey to non VATS shotgunning to the face. Pew pew. I remember having to crouch for sneak attack and use Lincon's Repeater with VATS headshots. In one place I had 3!!! Of them and my brand new Chinese Assault rifle and I barely made it out alive.
---
That was FO3. In FO76 I literally can take out 10-15 of them without much issue. The missile guy is a problem and the mini gun guy can be one two but two close for missiles they switch to a board. That close the 12 Guage works better than a board.

Corn and razorgrain soup for life!
---
And here I was thinking I was cool for one shotting legendaries with an instigating deathclaw gauntlet, thanks for the tip.
---
This song comes up fairly frequently on Appalachia Radio. You can turn it on in your Pip-Boy under the radio tab. There are a few good gems that they play, including John Denver’s “Country Roads.” I just wish they hd a little more variety - I can sing every song by heart at this point.
---
I understand your concern. But do you know for a fact the other player had a duped weapon?
---
I have had multiple 2 Shot Weapons and Explosive Weapons dropped. I actually got my 2 Shot Explosive Shotgun from a legit drop. 
---
See?  Now here you’ve just thrown a little, childish tantrum and lost any merit your post may have had. 
---
You did it again.
---
Springs and ballistic fiber, and more springs!
---
And again.
---
&gt;  people like us, those who enjoy the game for what it is, are just trying to justify their money spent
---
...
---
&gt; I feel I've gotten my money's worth.
---
And here.
---
That sounds about right lol.
---
Can I get a uhhhhh.....pølïśhèd gamē
---
Sorry, Dev machime b r   o  k    e
---
Nice! I had no idea and I used to camp near Charleston station early in the game! Thanks for the great info!!
---
I'm on PC or I'd suggest starting a discord for honest players. My team is pretty gung ho about their TSEs and won't give them up although they KNOW they bought them from fishy folk. I'd love to play with people dedicated to not using TSEs and/or any duped anything.
---
I'm down
---
Time to  make bank on water
---
That definitely won't come with a swarm of problems at al
---
When every other person has one it’s a duping issue. I’ve yet to see a single TSE in almost 200 levels.
---
Happens here too. PC. It's extremely frustrating. Half the time one of us is invisible (which also makes it impossible to trade), or partially naked or stretched out and naked.
---
🌽 CORN SOUP 🌽
---
Thanks will do that..
---
I've been doing that with magazines, too. Haven't found any good ones but they take up my valuable storage space.
---
16 hours between a buddy and I. Zero mods, but he got the plan, thankfully. 
---
Yeah, workshops really need a buff to be viable, especially when you consider all of your construction costs are a complete loss unless you somehow don't crash and run around scrapping every single item manually.
---
The only place that's been worthwhile is the ammo factory, for everything else its a lot easier to just run around picking up every single fork and spoon and seeing what comes out the other end.
---
I don't know, I think that's a big insult to their intelligence to assume it takes them 200 hours to realize something is not fun.
---
Really take a moment to think about how much time that is.  An average person is going to spend that time over 2 months or so.  
---
Essentially you are suggesting OP is literally insane by definition, and it took them 200 hours to snap out of it?  I have to firmly disagree with that.  
---
It is far more likely they did have fun, for a good majority of that time.
---
I can list you like 30 games that became amazing a year after their launch due to patching and content updates. 
---
My friend has the plans. I'll try to get you in touch tomorrow evening. 
---
I was just trying to help, downvotes? Wow, this place is aggy. 
---
I took "later this month" to mean the end of the month, could be mistaken i guess. 
---
@3: unequip weight perk card should explode your now overfilled stash 🙄
---
This is so genius
---
Lol that bad ass rolling pin! That’s also about the only thing I see once in a while that seems like god tier at like 89 dmg lol
---
Basically #1 I have no idea how to PVP in general... #2 Bethesda definitely needs to work on PVP given that a player who is currently stealing a base of yours, and who has already killed you, is not already hostile. and #3 I should probably just go ahead and get rid of every weapon I own that isn't a 3 star legendary (especially at lvl 80+)... Is that about right?
---
Walk up to a stream pickup dirty water.. eat raw meat.. what ever you got to do, parasites dont bother me
---
I looked, I didn’t find any. Could you send me some links?
---
True, i took it to mean the end of the month but i could be wrong. I was just trying to help, though. This place downvoting me is sure to put an end to that! 
---
I wasn't implying they are endorsing it, they just did a cost/benefit analysis and decided to let it continue. I think you can infer something from that but it definitely isn't them being happy about the situation.
---
Having a camp near there actually prevents any random encounter spawn-in, including the vendor
---
RNG is RNG. Yes there is a duping issue. But because you haven’t had one drop doesn’t mean everybody who has one is duping or bought duped items.
---
Reread my statement.
---
Protip: store your broken decon arch, then plop it back down. No flux. 
---
Thats awesome, Im on ps4 btw
---
Plan: Lever Gun definitely from Grafton, either train vendor or the one in town, easy to check both on the same server. I have seen it twice recently. 
---
Handmade - I've heard that one is only available in Harpers Ferry between L15-X. I believe it is 15-20 at the highest because I have tried MANY times with a L21 profile from the BETA and never seen the Handmade plan. 
---
If you aren't wanted or haven't engaged in PvP, then you can't be "one-shot" it's just not how it works. You must've done something in order to allow them to do full damage to you.
---
It doesn't, it's a lie people keep repeating without any proof at all, if Bethesda's sole concern was with server performance tied to item quantity, they would have implemented a unique item cap, instead of weight. 
---
My main group intentionally stored everything for days of Whitespring to test if  it would make any difference and sat on a server on our storage mules together for hours (sorting out thousands of Legendary items/junk) doing anything we could think of to cause lag (trading, putting in and out of storage/containers, dropping etc) and the server handled it fine.
---
The only lag spikes we noticed were when starting trades and when first logging in, but those are purely on the clients end and doesn't impact others in the area/far away on the same server.
---
Harper Ferry. House #394. Can also get it at a building just NE of Watoga where the tactical mask lands.  
---
This is on PC. I have both.
---
Mugabe saying that he just needs to get another keycard
---
I found the plans for them at the BOS vendor in wetoga .
---
So like... why are you here still? If you hate the game then why stay here in this sub?
---
Oof, we're PC. I'm sorry, but best of luck to you. 
---
Because you shouldn't be able to nuke the starter area... That would ruin the game for new players.
---
As far as I know anything you had (like well tuned perks) timers stay timed in game. (Some nights I log off with perks, and the next morning I wake up and log in and they’re still there, if only for the remaining time of the perk) so I’d assume that diseases work the same way? 
---
No worries I figured that was gonna hapen lol
---
That is 100% not true. I checked and I had pacifist mode on and was not wanted either time tonight. I never even saw the person the first time and the second they were standing in front of me then dead.
---
I can’t move past this either for fucksakes why do you do this?!
---
May I ask why you want a leg drill?
---
Ugh.  "all the hate was simply a  witch hunt"  
---
Not a witch hunt at all.  You like this sort of game, in your opinion, while others really do hate it because due to design decisions which remove the RPG elements or constant bugs.  Personally I think they made  so many frustrating design decisions and honestly believe it could have been way better.  Also Bethesda is just acting crummy as a business.
---
Would having a high luck build affect the appearance probability? 
---
They tried to hit patch it twice already. So infer they are trying to fix it. 
---
Maybe it’s a lot more complicated fix with the code and engine that 99% of the players to realize.
---
So I infer with 2 patches already that yes they are trying to fix the issue. Yet you fail to admit they have tried to fix the issue with 2 patches already. Don’t compare Bethesda and how long it takes them to patch something to other companies and games. Some engines and bugs are more complex code issues then you could imagine.
---
Improved? Definitely. But it's still got a long way to go.
---
I mean, I have to disagree that things are unpredictable though. Litterally every experience with a person outside of BETA has been exactly the same: *bump into player, they use some emote cause no one talks, I say hey on mic (If we acknowledge eachother at all), we go separate ways and probably never see eachother again* and I wish people would ask for help or trade with me. I've nade a billboard on my house right next to Flatwoods, where people can see it if they walk through the town (which literally every player HAS to) and a post on here about how I play and the attempt at rping in the game and I've gotten no results cause no one is doing that. I wish I've gotten the experience you've apparently gotten with cooperation, unpredictable experiences with other players, trading and such, and roleplaying. 
---
Not completely! I have no melee perks, but I use All Rise in power armor if I’m low on shells or if I’m facing something that I can save ammo on after crippling limbs. 
---
Idk. I only have 3 or 4 luck
---
No you definitely did something to cause it.
---
When you go through the trad reddit and all the TSE two and three stars have the exact same traits it’s an issue,
---
Well, i can craft serum, and it cost near to nothing for me. So 600 caps is still good.
---
Honestly, I'm hoping you can load them up at your camps, and then the ones you place at workshops share inventory with those in a similar way to how the stash box works. That would alleviate the workshop server DC issue.
---
However, if you have to individually load each one... I'm not putting any valuables at workshops, just excess ammo and aid items, and not many at each. However, I'll use the small letter sets to advertise my camp location as the main shop with all the AAA loot.
---
Game is broken* Unless you are talking about the green zone for new players that is.
---
Firstly, Bethesda refuses refunds because they're shit.
---
Secondly, why not? Bethesda deserves all the negative attention possible over this shit show.
---
Thirdly, why are you so concerned someone might have valid criticism about Bethesda/FO76? What's with the whole "so why are you still here?" line of questioning? Do you really think this release in its entirety is not worthy of a stunning amount of criticism?
---
People like you are the reason Bethesda will pull this same scam a year from now.
---
Pigppen?
---
Certain events drop PA plans too. 
---
I absolutely did not and this isn’t the first time. I logged in, shot some ghouls at white springs and went to sell. I never had a wanted tag.
---
I got my first TSE Pump at level 65 and I’m now Level 173. It was 3 star. Guess what it dropped with same perks as the dupped ones. Guess what mine isn’t duped and it dropped from a nice 3 star Glowie at White Springs.
---
I ended up with 17k walls had to scrap them all.
---
Thanks for the deeply informative breakdown dude.  I certainly am coming away from reading this more informed.  
---
Is there any other cooked items that increase carry weight besides cooked ragstag ? Because that extra carry weight is great 
---
Watoga Station has it ive found several on my lvl15
---
My stomach dropped when I found this place. Husband and I had to take a breather and go hug our kids...
---
I don't think they appreciated being woken up.
---
How about you quit blaming the game and look at your machine.
---
Just because YOU got lucky does not mean everyone else did,
---
I’m just saying we over reacting to the level at which duping has damage the game.
---
I think it’s better this problem is now. Then 5 years down the line with level 80 5 Star Legendaries.
---
Never had a one blue screen in over 300h, You sure it's not something on your side?
---
Pig-Pen?
---
I agree RNG is RNG.
---
Your rad stag stew doesn't have the same zing with purified water.  
---
So they basically took the entire month of December off, how nice for them lol.
---
For the last one no if it's good keep it unless you find a better one I have a good non legendary hunting rifle and most of my weapons are 1 or 2 * I have like 1 3* legendary i think 
---
Wouldn’t it be nice...if we were older then we wouldn’t have to wait so loooooong
---
yeah that's definitely something on your end
---
Just curious if that would be useful in real time. If op it's on console he would have to draw a handwritten grid and communicate location and the grid system he's using to his team. 
---
From what we got yes, there was a window in the atom shop that explained that we would get a free picture frames if we were to explore locations and take pictures at “the right places” during New Year’s Eve 
---
So we set out in teams of two and “selfied across the wastes” Though we didn’t find anything. Possibly we misunderstood something as English isn’t our first languages XD 
---
Scam? lol okay. There is no reason for anyone to constantly shit on the game, especially on a subreddit where people who play the game, and enjoy the game, converse on. That's like going to a biker club to shit on motorcycles because they're "unsafe"
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
AAA titles have been releasing like this for a while now, Bethesda isn't the first nor is the last.
---
A movie that could absolutely never be remade today as the majority is about the main character trying to get into a relationship with an at first unaware mid 20s female. Then once she gets aware, it was even awkward then. Now it's just courtroom evidence out of Florida. 
---
That’s i retesting, although I did definitely encounter Graham there but that is probably different as he just walks his routes.
---
Thanks TIL
---
When you are building in a workshop, if the junk is in green it’s not coming from your own personal reserves
---
If you’re on now I’m interested in quite a few serums. Farming for them has been absolutely awful.
---
I can agree with your second sentence,that it’s better to happen now than in the future. Until Beth responds though this is all speculation.
---
I loved that feature in NV for weapon repair.  Weapon repair kits would also be beneficial. 
---
Brahmin and they always spawn at Flatwoods.
---
I've never had this happen like you say, nor have I ever seen it. You said you shot some ghouls. You might have hit something besides the ghouls that caused it.
---
Remember the name of someone in your current server, drop the plan in a storage in the same server (there’s a couple of things that work as global storages, i.e, anyone can take/leave stuff from/in them), hop on your main and rejoin someone from your “recent list”, grab your plan.
---
The fact that dupers have mules doesn't make muling cheating.  Try again.
---
Just to be clear, you saw I'm on xbox. I was just helping the PC guy find cheap ones. If you're on xb1 as well dm me and I'll get you whatever you need tomorrow 
---
I've seen it floating once, and also one time it somehow landed hard and flipped on its side.  Still worked the same, but kinda odd
---
I agree I have almost no problems playing this game except maybe a random lag spike when I first log into the world
---
Same thing has happened to me a couple of times. I close out of the game and then reload and it fixes itself. I’m on PS4 
---
Being one-shot with pacifist is a known issue. This’s isn’t some freak occurrence. It’s not even just TSE either, I’ve been killed by a melee the same way.
---
It's completely silly but this whole game has turned into me exploring to find a good camp spot... And me doing quests to get plans for better house stuff. I want an epic homestead. I'm enjoying it so much despite the flaws of the game. But mind you, I'm a casual gamer who just really likes "sandbox" type games.
---
Most fun is .50 Cal with explosive ammo and double the capacity. The damn thing melts packs of enemies, and rarely needs reloading.
---
Second is explosive Combat Shotgun, it's like an "erase" button on anything you point it at. I just wish shotguns had more range.
---
Haven't checked the pack rat column but your red and green are exactly ass backwards for the non pack rat.
---
You have aluminum and lead marked as red when they are and have always been some of the biggest weight savers.
---
Scam refers to the specific lies they used and repeated while marketing the game before its release.
---
I don't really care if somehow its become normal for companies to release shit and treat customers terribly, that's why I'll continue to post and criticize this game and the development studio behind it.
---
What do you mean "there is no reason for anyone to constantly shit on the game"? Did you miss the several reasons for why someone would shit on the game? I didn't even mention the dozens of posts on this subreddit from users who get frustrated by crashes or losing items, do you ask people who post about their experience with bugs "there is no reason for anyone to constantly shit on the game"?
---
The reason so many people shit on the game might just be because it is shit. Maybe you have very different standards for what a shit game is, but for many people this is a shit game and will be treated like a shit game.
---
Well we know they have responded. They have did to patches to try to stop and fix duping.
---
I Believe Bethesda hasn’t respond yet because of the fact of the engine and it being a server hosted game. It a lot harder to fix the code to completely stop duping. I believe it’s a bug that’s harder to fix then we as the community knows and that’s why Bethesda hasn’t made a statement yet.
---
So they have tried to hit fix it and dupers found a way to glitch around it twice now.
---
I believe Bethesda with in the next week will state something along those lines. I also believe we will get an update with The plans to roll out content for the next 3-6 months.
---
That Hacking and Slashing one. And really the number of songs and the repeat interval. 
---
Excellent
---
The games only fun until lvl 30. Then it starts to show its true colors. Dont @ me. 
---
yea thats probably an austrailia thing. im on the east coast of the us and i have absolutely no problems connecting and staying connected.
---
Running a bloodied build with weapon artisan makes the drill really awesome/easy in pve.
---
Want to know what's the best ripper style weapons, I know that furious and vampires only works for the power attack but I want to find out if bloodied or mutants etc work on the 'ripping' atttack
---
YES. I actually get excited when I find dirty water while scavenging, despite having a ground water pump at my camp (in addition to an industrial water purifier).
---
I hate how long pumping ground water takes so much that I tend to go without soups and teas because I absolutely detest the tedious process.
---
Yeah but do you remember Zoltar?  Because that, and dancing on a keyboard was the only thing I remembered. 
---
 r/fo76bazaar
---
I like that idea... That's why im hoping you can place more then one, per category. Unless they do it like robot vendors, with sub categories. 
---
Call me dubious...
---
Nukes are broken atm
---
If you still want help IGN: marco810
---
But you didn't actually play it through. You used spoilers and metagame information, skipped as much as you could, and then ground and exploited your way to the "end of the main quest" without pausing even once to catch your breath and then turned on the developers with shrieks of entitled, petulant rage.
---
It's already broken, barely holding together with Wonderglue and duct tape atm.
---
You do realize PS4s BSOD?
---
Sweet sounds neat
---
I noticed the road going south the whitespring train station isn't marked, I seen him walking through there a lot.
---
As a division player, I will always remember April 31st. Seems Bethesda did the same thing. 
---
I'm only just starting my Whitesprings farming, but I understand the problem. I hope regular updates will bring the endgame content we need, like the new vaults opening. And before that happens, we'd better get ready for this.
---
&gt;On PC, click to drink one dirty water, immediately spam the collect button during the animation
---
I tried this, but sadly doesn't work on XB1. 
---
I love this perk
---
When I'm on teams I use this so I dont waist stimpacks
---
I play on pc
---
._.
---
Actually the server is only lagged for the duper themselves. If they overload it, though, they can crash the entire server, which is much, much worse.
---
1. Can you read a sentence? Because I'm pretty sure I put hardly in there. I know that there is stuff like the nuke system not working or the whitesprings over population but that isn't circle jerking. As well as not many updates need to be covered. I'm talking about making reviews and rants that haven't changed. You also forget that i don't care if people like the game when the bugs are fixed. I said several time i don't care if the reviews are bad or good afterwards. You just made that last part up to better your opinion.
---
2. There is nothing wrong with a bad review. I don't know where I have said they aren't allowed to make bad reviews because I haven't.  Yeah and guess what i never said it didn't have problems or that i haven't seen bugs and i know people are lying when they say they haven't seen a bug. I didn't say that those people aren't circle jerking. So I don't know what point you're trying to make that  there that just because the other side is circle jerking too means that means its okay for everyone to do it. I cringe sometimes reading comments of how people claim there are no bugs. If i have to say it again i'll say it my point I'm trying to make is that just because something isn't the best by any stretch of the imagination doesn't give any side to circle jerk.
---
Also if you max out hard bargainand pop a grape mentats I think I got my serum prices to just under 3k. I only have 4CHR also.
---
Make them toggled on/off for cosmetic purposes, my character has all 18 and I'm afraid to see how he changes
---
There is video on youtube, where man with chainsaw wreck ghouls like paper. You must know how to use it.
---
So, a few little things all came together to cause a very frustrating experience.
---
I was working on the quest "A Miner Miracle" I had checked my inventory and the only thing I was missing to make the entire set of excavator power armor was screws.  Sweet I load up all the junk I need to make the armor.  I go to the Garrahan Mining Headquarters and make an arm so that I have a full set of power armor.  Now I am out of screws. So I go across the street and start clearing out the mansion, figured I could get some screws there.  it's going pretty good. had a really fun fight with a wendigo that is twice my level. I used all of my stimpacks and finished with about 1/4 health. Overall, a nice boss; pretty appropriate difficulty for this place. I'm nearly finished clearing the mansion.  What could possibly go wrong?  I'll tell you what could go wrong. Someone else enters the mansion. I'm standing in the middle of the third floor, near death no healing left, two broken weapons, and "BOOM!" everything respawns! I run for my life but just can't make it. I'm dead. All the black titanium and everything else I need to make the armor is in a little brown paper bag on the third floor of the mansion.  I respawn, make sure I have a working weapon equipped and charge back to the mansion. I quickly take the elevator to the third floor.  The other player is still below. I fight my way through the Feral Ghouls. Up ahead, I see it, the paper bag that has almost everything I need for the quest. Only one ghoul left. I start shooting him. He's not dying. I keep shooting. What is hap... "Disconnected From Server"...
---
Despite the initial frustration of being quicky murdered because someone else opened a door. This was almost a very exciting and enjoyable part of the game, the race to get back to my bag before the other player finds it.  The thrill of seeing the very important resources. Then no know that I would never have a chance to get them back because of some network/server issue. I was crushing.
---
There is *kinda* one inside Wendigo cave. It's illuminated by "daylight" as if it's water falling down a crag in the cave roof.
---
Makes for nice pics though.
---
Of course, although I think the Cavern of the Evil Wizard was more memorable.
---
Sidenote, someone actually made a fan copy of that made up game if you wanted to check it out here - http://www.bomtoons.com/biggame.html
---
As a Vats-Luck-Crit-Sneak-Unyielding build I love scorchbeasts.
---
Silently tag one and they come looking for you. When they can't figure out where you are, they land. Creep up to their face and kill them with one clip.
---
It should have been hotfixed, not just patched. We are going from Dec 19th, to Jan 11 to patch this. The reason it isn't hotfixed is cost, plain and simple. 
---
I figured they’d have a special skin for when you have them all. It would be great if they could be toggled though. 
---
O_O
---
OwO
---
the it just works is a meme in reference to todd howard saying it.
---
I’m an Eagles fan for life!! We can talk about it all night long. Hoping the legend of Saint Nick grows this year. 
---
thats nuts, i have none of those problems. have you tried to contact your internet provider?
---
UwU
---
I have then all as well. I’ll need to take a closer look at them. Maybe they could somehow blend together.
---
Not sure if it's been mentioned but the last 24 hours on PS4 my excavator torso unequips randomly. Mainly after i exit the armour but sometimes when i join a server or fast travel. After a few hours it's now my right arm unequiping. 
---
Interesting... my Zealot+Prime Receiver Bolt-Action Rifle did just fine...  and my new Two-Shot is quite good against SBQ's as well...    wonder what the difference is in our builds...?
---
I've seen this post 10 million times already, if you're listening Bethesda just do it already!
---
There's many things they could do. For example, shotguns add explosive damage to each pellet. Instead, it should be adding explosive damage divided by the number of pellets to each pellet. For high ROF guns (Minigun, etc.) they can put an internal cooldown on explosive damage, so that it procs once every second at most. So even if you fire 8 rounds per second (double shot Minigun), only one explodes.
---
There is a clear difference between someone voicing concerns about a bug, reporting such bug, and moving on after giving said information about the bug for it to be fixed, and someone who returns to this subreddit to shoot down the game at every chance they get. You're doing nothing to improve the game by constantly speaking badly about it. 
---
Just because you don't like the game doesn't mean you have to ruin it for every who does like it. Didn't your parents teach you to not say anything if you have nothing nice to say? You can rant and report bugs but when you start to incessantly say the game is awful without offering any sort of solution, you're just adding to the problem.
---
You can criticize the game. I'm not saying you can't do that. Your criticism should be constructive rather than destructive.
---
I'd love that for legendary weapon / armor perks.  Even if it was at 3% for base and the 40% increase brought it up to 5% chance.  If you scrap a legendary weapon then, you have a 5% chance to pull that perk off as a mod.  Then it takes some significant resources to attach legendary mods.
---
That would essentially make duper inventory almost worthless.  We can then grind to our ideal builds and don't need to rely on a black market of duped items.
---
I've been hearing the nuke silos were down bc of a bug but the fissure sites are collapsed? Like, as in, there was an actual, visible change to them? Did you get a screenshot?
---
So I may be comparing apples to oranges here but coming from the Pokémon community we deal with this level of cheating on a daily basis and maybe there is a way to learn from the steps they take. Basically every Pokémon can be genned or cloned to look exactly like a legit Pokémon. Using save manipulation and tools like pkhex allow people to flood the global trade system and create perfect battle ready shinies with no time or effort needed. As a community we have had to accept this fact that the company will not be able to ban these people and these Pokémon will never disappear from online play. With this knowledge most on reddit who care about legitimacy will use subreddits like pokemontrades which require users to provide proof of catching a shiny with their username visible or something along the lines of that to prove the catch or hatch was legitimate. 
---
I guess what I’m getting at is, if we assume Bethesda will not be able to ban these people or delete these items, maybe our only alternative is to create a community that supports honest earning by creating rules for exchange that require proof of item legitimacy somehow? Idk I’m just brainstorming out loud here. It’s frustrating for sure. 
---
I was not aware of this and how do you do it
---
I think grahm is a bit of an exception because he spawns in and travels around the map
---
Hmm idk if I'd trust you with a username like that
---
They shut the nukes off for white springs event and its like they cant get them to work again. Lol. 
---
Nah it says optional
---
What legendary effects even do what he did? It was clearly explosive whatever it was, but, like I said, I have DE5 and if I can do that, I have no idea how. Haven't messed with mines too much yet though (nuke mine for example), or is the explosive legendary effect just that OP?
---
Same. Is the cargobot broken too? That stupid thing is way too hard to kill.
---
OMG I was doing it wrong this whole time!
---
And I thought the quest was glitched - no, I was just mistakenly assuming it was *me* that was supposed to wear the clown suit.
---
Sadly, I can't figure out how to get dialog with Mr. Wendigo before combat starts.  I must not be pressing the right key...
---
Now your showing your agenda of just wanting smear Bethesda now. It is obvious that have did to hotfix patches already. It is at Christmas holiday and they probably had the week of and didn’t return to work to the 2nd Of Jan. A lot of companies do that. I promise you it is a priority to fix it.
---
Yet you give them no credit for their attempts to fix the issue.
---
I believe at this point you just don’t like Fallout76 and Bethesda. You probably been all over reddit bad mouthing them and other social media. Do you or have you even played the game.
---
Or you one of those people that get paid to go to social media forums and bad mouth and complain about products? To undermine them?
---
If you think it’s shit, gtfo of this sub and hop in fortnite with the rest of your kind
---
It's just a hivemind thing. Comes from so many people complaining about bethesda that they like to remind us that they suck at bug fixing. It's a broken record.
---
I meant it as an idea they can use.
---
Fully molded legendary explosive shotguns with right perk cards can do almost 17k mine does 800 I don't have all the mods for it yet
---
Unless you are watching and reading content by literal nobodies then I have to assume you are just branding everything critical as a circlejerk since most of the stuff out there is actually diverse in its criticism. Unless you are having some sort of industry plagiarism frenzy where if IGN talk about X then everyone else can't.
---
That’s sounds awesome
---
So I just reached the overseers camp and stopped for a break, but so far I'm enjoying it. It's not difficult picking up on things and thankfully, Reddit helps a lot when it comes to tips for beginners! :)
---
Actually, if you really get down to it, nearly all of the perks are just QOL improvements in some form. Damage increases? They don't let you do anything special, they just let you kill stuff faster. First aid? Again, nothing fancy, you just need less stimpacks. And ironically, the few that *do* actually allow you to do new things are even worse, because those are the ones you end up constantly swapping in and out just to do said thing for a minute, and none of those things are particularly exiting. 
---
See, the real issue with the perk card system is that it was never meant to *be* a card system. These perks were never meant to be limited, exclusive, or swappable. They were meant to be combined indefinitely until such a time as you decide to stop progressing that character. 
---
When you look at ability systems in other games that make you choose one ability or another and force you to drop one to take something else, you will see that the majority of these give you some new and interesting power. And the purpose for making them limited is because they provide powers and capabilities such that if players were able to combine them indiscriminately, their characters would become completely overpowered, and possibly undefeatable. 
---
No such character power increase exists in the FO perk system. In fact, if anything, the greatest power increases come from mutations, and the limitations of the perk system does nothing to prevent this. Meanwhile, because of the silly, ridiculous limitations, we are unable to do things like have pistols of both automatic and non-automatic varieties do max damage at the same time (ironically, *because* of the fact that they use the same stat). It's difficult to put into words just how utterly absurd such a limitation is.
---
They probably would've been better off just sticking with the same system FO4 has, with some tweaks and adaptations. But if they want to stick with the card system, the best solution I've seen is one someone proposed in another thread on this topic, and that was simply to give two card points instead of one for every SPECIAL stat point. 
---
Let me know your GT, I'll be on tomorrow night and I'd be interested in some serums. I just got my first one today, marsupial. Very cool!
---
Mine is Kaise7en. Thanks! 
---
Thanks for pointing this out.  I just made 4 of the 5 types that give bonus melee damage and all 4 were active at once.  I've updated my post to say those will stack.  I could have sworn I tried this on melee foods a couple days ago and they didn't stack.
---
I’ve seen some people post here and on other pages, also on the official club
---
As much of a decent idea it is with helping others out, I hate being dependent on someone else to complete challenges. A week ago or so I had a daily for trading with a player for a small 10 atoms. Spent 2 hours chasing people across the map trying to get them to trade, and those who did accept the trade didn't offer, request, or buy anything off me any way. Never got my 10 atoms. I do have friends, but we aren't always on at the same time.
---
If we were to have these challenges, I'd prefer to have them as weekly or permanent challenges.
---
&gt;You don't need more than 2 weapons / ammo type don't hoard just toss it and keep moving!  
---
As someone who carries about 20 weapons at a time using almsot every ammo type this feel like an attack
---
AngelOfDeath116 just send me a dm or something and we can work it out 
---
Yes. The closer to max range you get, the less damage it will do. I'm not sure how it scales in this game, but it should be similar to how FO4 was.
---
In theory, Long Shot should extend Range. Although I can't seem to get Crack Shot to work, or at least it's not changing the stat on the Pipboy.
---
They said they were working in it after launch let them fix issues first
---
&gt;lack of head armor for non-PA users
---
THIS.
---
Yep, I've been making corn soup ever since I found that farm south of Flatwoods that has about 40 corn plants on it!
---
Send in a support ticket. This happened to me on xbox and I had it all dealt with and had my atoms returned the next day. 
---
Submit it now and happen it gets dealt with tmr since it is new years day 
---
*jingle jangling in the distance*
---
Or are you so passionate your letting your passion fig your judgement?
---
I lost 13 mods in my stash from a single scrap. This needs to be fixed.
---
Atleast there was dungeons to do, with UBRS/MC to look forward to. A bit of progression. If FO76 released with 2 vault instances - would be similar to what you're saying. It's just grind WS/SBQ atm
---
I personally feel that this is a prelude to some kids and of DLC reveal.    It's to coincidental that the nuke silos and fissure sites all went to hell at the same time just before the new year.
---
Agreed, I haven't been there in awhile and started venturing around Cranberry bog and the divide between the mire (there's an epic behemoth that spawns in the area sometimes near the workshop) and realized that when I did finally come across a three star it would do the health regen because the thing there can actually handle more than one or two smacks of a weapon and I would get somewhat decent loot. I took the experiment to whitesprings tonight and it seemed to work well. It was nice seeing more than one legendary at a time again as well even if it is a high traffic area. 
---
Happened at Lake Side Cabins for me too. Marker led me to a leaf pile. No enemies anywhere. Tried shooting and grenadine the area and nothing. 
---
And here I am sitting on 4k atoms waiting for a  ghillie suit.
---
I believe that is already in the plans as is NPCs and other Enemies like Raiders.
---
They were in my area I had really hoped that they would fix the crashing issues but I got to the end of another side mission tonight and it crashed again no the servers were down this time but maybe that’s what they need to do it right
---
Yes, I commented on that one down at the very bottom.  It was the final recipe I bought at Whitespring.  It's definitely easiest of that group to gather ingredients for.  This recipe is the only one I know of that affects 2 of the group of bonuses that I collated above.
---
Kinda late but no worries neat stuff 
---
Really good break down, thanks.
---
Sure but nobody said what it was placed on.
---
 **Wasted 25 stimpaks unknown ammo killed scorched beast**  Is this a question or a statement.  It doesn't make sense as either.
---
 **invisible assultron**  Other than spelling poorly, this is a feature of some assaultrons in the game.   They can go invisible, and they were programmed in that way.  Whitesprings no, Watoga absolutely.
---
This all occurred to me fighting gulpers. Just wanted to throw that in. Those things can tank hits from almost anything. 
---
I need to find a rare wandering vendor to learn how to drill a hole in a wall to lay my cables?
---
I don’t even ahhhh 
---
How are you even getting 1shot? What TSE weapon? How much health and DR do you have? Seems off to me.
---
that's not proper balancing though
---
melee is super OP if you spec right and it comes with a lot of tradoffs
---
The problem is this same character super built for melee DPS can pick up an explosive shotgun and do far better and now ranged DPS without even having to change much if any.
---
I just did this with all of my .556.
---
It took all of it.
---
Sadness
---
Thanks again! Now if I can just find some one that wants to trade a Ultracite Right Arm for Shocks!
---
Think of it like a 30CM ruler but the numbers were not put in for some reason, you can still make strait lines with it, it still has the little lines so you can count to how long something is, but it is missing some things that should really have been on it but that can easily be fixed later with a pen
---
Thanks for helping me!
---
Yeah, the sense of entitlement and lack of appreciation for progress made and coming (as announced earlier) is kind of sad. I guess some people need that.
---
I don't have to imagine. I have crashed on the queen twice haha
---
Just play [this](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1FsRBYfDZBYlXosnO8IPdi) through your console or PC. I put in all the music from fallout 1-4, NV, and 76. Plus more. And I update it!
---
Pretty sure you can get it elsewhere. That's where I got it for me and a friend. 
---
It’s a bug that Bethesda is aware of and looking into, currently no nukes can be launched 
---
I almost had a couple people on the golf course tonight, I noticed they were down near where the fissure was and they weren't moving around much and the lobby was stalling out horribly, I hopped out my PA popped a stealth boy and when I got about 100 yards away and could see them and their base the game crashed. My guess is they saw me coming. 
---
Rockstar really didn't have an internal approved roadmap for content, everything was built, released, studied, and patched, but they took those lessons learned and were able to frequently repeat the process.
---
Bethesda hasn't been given that chance yet. The old engine (fallout 3 and NV) was never going to support MP, and it makes sense in retrospect that they planned ahead for MP building the 4 engine.
---
 Just play [this](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1FsRBYfDZBYlXosnO8IPdi) through your console or PC. I put in all the music from fallout 1-4, NV, and 76. Plus more. And I update it! 
---
I bought a TSE Gauss that gets up to 2k damage at low health, doesn’t really count though because it was probably duped. 
---
I’m lvl 140 and have never actually rolled an explosive weapon at all. 
---
You can get a legendary drill but not a legendary hunting rifle....
---
All they do is mark nearby locations on your map so you can see where to go explore. There’s various towers around the map that have this feature 
---
If you're not first, you're last. 
---
I'm a raider, I take what I want when I want. I'll bust your house up cause it's funny. I don't agree with anything you have said here sir. I've got a life and a family- this is my escape. I want to be the bad guy and laugh.  Laugh I do sometimes I win sometimes I lose. I help people after smashing their head if their a good sport about it and they put up a good fight. I get called a griefer and I don't agree with that but whatever. it's a game and I don't want to be the friendly sunshine vault community in vault city. I wanna blow stuff up and fight people. I don't care what level or how many. That's what I like to do
---
So it’s been saying that for me since about three in the afternoon yesterday for me.  I heard they shut down the solos so no one could nuke on New Years because there was supposed to be an event at white springs or some shit.  But I never saw anything. 
---
I'm hoping this leads to a scorchbeast king, I think it would be insane for a new fissure to open up at whitesprings and just throw everything into chaos. 
---
top right corner. find flair
---
And I can list hundreds more that didn't. In my opinion they need to be much quicker with patches and updates. Specifically bug patches.
---
Heard some news that Bethesda turn off nukes for the new year.... to give new players a chance to visit whitesprings..........
---
Its one of those things.
---
Good for many&gt;Good for few
---
I've put in a ton of hours as well, but if I get everything wiped and the game isn't frustrating from just a technical standpoint every fifteen minutes then I'm more than happy starting over.
---
Funny that they'll ban someone for calling another players names and griefing them but they won't do anything about dupers.
---
Crap, you're right... you save .5 pounds... My red and green is flopped. Will update.
---
Beth just needs to hand more technical control over to ZOS. The ESO team saved that game from an abysmal launch, they can do it again.
---
well id like to believe they planned ahead but really you just cant. not the way it is now
---
My Auto Laser Rifle sometimes does this, same with my Auto Tesla Rifle. If I start getting latency issues I have a much easier time doing one shot pulls. They're certainly weird.
---
I have picked it up at Harpers Ferry at lv15, not sure about Grafton.
---
If the game were to shut down for a few months and re-launch as a clean slate free of exploitable bugs, I'd accept that.
---
Tears
---
I am surprised they don't have an automated one just to help drive the point home about how much WV was trying to remove human workers even more.
---
oh shit, fissure sites contain scorchbeasts?
---
16 tons tho
---
There's actually quite a few especially if you count the ones that increase STR.  Those would be: Simple Fern Flower Tea, Steeped Fern Flower Tea, Deathclaw Steak, Deathclaw Wellington, Mole Rat Chunks and Stingwing Filet.  The ones that straight up increase carry weight are (besides the radstag one): Grilled Radtoad (+10), Ribeye Steak (+20), Roasted Ant (+10), and Smoked Mirelurk Filet (+30).  That last one sounds great, but you need 3 Ash Rose to make it.  I see those hear and there like in and around Welch and one or two in Savage Divide (seems odd to find them there), but I don't specifically know where a bunch are that can be gathered quickly to make more than 1 of the +30 food.
---
I don't know if these stack.  I didn't try that.
---
I'm okay with unique and valid criticism like if people complain about explosive needing balances or whitesprings overpopulation but not just constantly making videos or articles without adding anything new to it. I will say IGN does seem to circle jerk about it ideas but I will say the rest are not as bad.
---
Anyone heard anything else about this? I’m having the same issue &amp; its Kinda aggravating doing everything else just to find out I can’t complete the mission bc the elevator doesn’t want to work.
---
Seriously, stop. It’s your computer you barely month old Redditor. I’ve gone through this quest multiple of times with different characters and I only disconnected once.
---
No. Not better, but still OP as hell. For me, I love it. I'm a tank/melee build, I can just eat damage for my team, and also 1-4 hit literally anything. 
---
With the obvious exception of the Scortchbeast Queen
---
\+karma
---
Heck I'm level 80 and cant stand the trading system, brown bag is easier imo
---
thanks!
---
Shieeet TSE Pipe rifle? stepping it up lol thats the only legendary pipe weapon I'd rock
---
Maybe the op is a programmer and is addicted to CamelCase? 
---
Planning on adding MP capabilities is different than planning on continuing to strip away NPC dialogue. I mean I'm sure the next generation of AAA shooters is already is production, it's not like they don't have foresight with million dollar budgets. But then you get a board of directors and shareholder profit growth and turn a *game* into a *microtransaction laden commodity*... And it's gross and the creative side of it suffers.
---
Scorch Beast Queen will only spawn during a nuke at Prime Fissure. 
---
Scorch Beast any level will spawn out of fissures. And you can actually watch them spawn.
---
Nope just a pain in the ass. Always try and shoot the four propulsion arms until they smoke and it will just hover over you. The vertibots don't do any major damage so they are best ignored. 
---
lol....I was going to say "Am I late to the party?" But was too embarrassed.
---
Xbox here but Always try and shoot the four propulsion arms until they smoke and it will just hover over you. The vertibots don't do any major damage so they are best ignored. Take a breather and try and get some more ammo and resupply, if it flys over watoga or the mire it will get shot down quickly. 
---
She started off at Lv19, so she had a decent head start of everyone.
---
what’s the point of duping quantum cola..?
---
Yeah, would love to see that 100% implemented.
---
I'd LOCK all the guns and armor I'm using.
---
**If you go to FO76 Bazzar reddit or FO76 Market reddit, there are people there that probably have one you can buy for caps.**  It may be as low as 1,000 or up to 5,000.  All depends on how bad you want it, and how much the other person likes it.
---
You have a fusion generator plan?
---
Ill buy or post the good ones in r/76market people will buy
---
Seriously. Ballistic fiber should be available at police stations, prisons, laboratories, airports ... shit even suitcases and backpacks (IRL) have lower quality ballistic fabrics in them. 
---
Similar issue. I was fighting my way to the rear of wendigo cave. Someone else entered and it respawned everything.  I died.  
---
They looted my paper bag and disconnected.  I’m livid 
---
I felt the same way, then went to White Springs. Came down the railroad tracks from the north to White Spring Station, then crossed the road into the resort because I'd heard how tough it was there for lower levels and so I figured maybe coming in from the train station side would be safer. Much faster leveling this way. Rest in a bed for the well rested XP bonus and craft some cranberry cobbler to eat before you start killing ghouls to get extra XP. 
---
I never even done White Springs after a nuke. It's just a good place to get XP.
---
I feel for you.  That's happened to me before.  If it makes you feel better you'll eventually learn all the good places to find screws.  I go through a lot of them also, but right now I have over 300 and I'm just about to stop picking up things that have screws in them.  I still have trouble getting enough springs though.
---
Do you know if any other "high buildings or structures" accomplish this? Or is it specifically "Lookout" towers?
---
Not until this current world is stable. I'm having a lot fun, but I'm also very frustrated with how quickly I can crash and lose whatever progress I was working on. 
---
Yeah I know. The fissures have closed up and people are speculating that it's Beth hinting at new content. This post is just speculation that the new content could be something like the above says. Just a thought more than anything. Trust me I know how they work hahaha
---
I like fallout76 but it has serious problems that needed to be fixed on a timeline quicker than what occurred. It is a very flawed game, but it also has parts I thoroughly enjoy.
---
I have a high level character, killed queen a dozen times probably. I just am able to step back and look at things honestly with an indifference that you see as some kind of grudge.
---
The dupe glitch is a huge problem for the long term health of the game. I have tried to explain why I feel this way but you see them as personal attacks against Bethesda. I don't see how it gets fixed at this point, if I am being honest. Economy is extremely important to a looting multiplayer game like this.
---
Also, no I am not paid by anyone and my only agenda is to openly discuss the dupe problem honestly.
---
I'm a little late to the party, but I'm willing to help out!
---
Ya mostly when I’m in the stash
---
I hope they address the duping bug, and I hope they have a solution to remove all the duped stuff out there.
---
So fucked up. They won't release hotfix patches to address duping. 
---
Now 5 weeks without playing and losing interest everytimevi come back here. 
---
Loot on tables, under beds, on top of TV's etc is world loot.  Whoever gets it first, gets it.
---
Loot in any "container" that you have to open (trunks, chests, dressers, some fridges) is instanced.  2 people looting the same area will get different things from the same containers.  If you both loot a chest, they may get a pipe pistol and stimpack, you might get a pitchfork and cram.
---
dropped some ammo infront of you, ima get off good luck hf
---
I've shot them down many times, but every time I wait until I see one being attacked by super mutants or scorched.  They'll usually take out half the health by the time I go around and kill all of them.  Makes taking down the cargobot a lot faster.
---
I've noticed when I first encounter the Cargobot, if you take a shot at it the thing freaks out and rushes over to a specific location where then it will fly around in circles. However its a pain in the ass to keep a steady shot on it because of how fast it circles in the area where it wants you to destroy it. Best way I dealt with it was either Vats, Miniguns, or my favorite the Homing missle mod for the Rocket Launcher was a good tool in bringing it down.
---
Completing the raider questline adds Rose's Raider Radio, but that doesnt have any music. Just recordings of Rose talking about drugs, killing, and general raider things.
---
I actually love that song, and that man’s voice is like butter. Funny story: I was playing alone in the living room one day while my boyfriend played his own game in the study, and I was singing along to it and came to the lyrics:
---
You load sixteen tons, and what do you get?
---
Another day older and deeper in debt.
---
Saint Peter don’t you call me ‘cause I can’t goooo...
---
I owe my soul to the company store!
---
And I heard my boyfriend shout from the other room, “Damn right!” I think the song touched a nerve haha.
---
People act like they didn't release a letter before the beta explaining there was going to be LOTS of bugs...
---
https://open.spotify.com/user/awdangbro/playlist/4jWq4OWhOkQbDv5vrWmHKv?si=2U2csekBQIailI2E5_lvtg
---
It's not a very long playlist but I've been trying to make my own radio stations geared towards whatever my goals for the session are. This one is for general exploration/ farming. It's collaborative as well so add tracks that you think fit the general mood!
---
It heals for a LOT and weighs very little with the right perks. Fills your water stat up a lot as well.
---
I got it for him, it was flying high for some reason tho
---
Agreed. I know lots of people like the holotapes, terminals and notes, but I really miss characters like Nick Valentine, Piper, and Macready, even after our quests were done and it was just a few lines of dialogue left to cycle through.
---
I took the Sunshine workshop two times in the last half hour. And everytime I went to scrap junk at a bench in the workshop my game crashed. So many resources just lost. 
---
i’d like to know as well 
---
Stop complaining about stuff!
---
Oh and the Scorch beasts are annoying and need to change.
---
Straight jacket is 200 and sells for 25 with no hard bargain perk. So if I had to guess it would be around 30-35 caps
---
yea X to inspect
---
I just live off of ribeye steaks and purified water, occasionally a sweetwater tea.  I'm a simple man. XD
---
Welcome fellow crit sneaker!
---
As a note, using Aligned mods (stock and barrel) reduces AP consumption by a good amount. Same with a Reflex Sight.
---
And if you're happy with the current armor pierce, slapping a Swift Mag (Ammo + Reload) also helps with AP.
---
Only look out 
---
That's cool.  Thanks for the link!
---
yeah the pvp meta right now is one shotting be it melee mutants or explosive guns
---
sadly this is normal
---
As a carnivore, I eat so much Mirelurks meat, I think I'm turning into one ^_^
---
Good I hope you enjoy it. The map is really cool. Each area has its own biome so there’s a lot of variety and cool things to explore. The criticism was just in the sense that there definitely some stability issues that need to be resolved and wouldn’t hurt to have more variety in the things to do like what they are doing with the new vaults essentially being 4 man dungeons but those things will all come in time. It’s definitely not the horrible game that a lot of people make it out to be. It’s very addictive or at least it is to me.
---
3 days later when he hits the stash limit:
---
REEEEEEEEE
---
Did it go well tonight and will you be back tomorrow? I’d love to come and get some half decent legendaries finally
---
I’ve seen some kinda waterfalls. The little waterway by the Alpine River Cabins has some small waterfalls and rapids. And I’m pretty sure I saw another small one high up in the mountains on the border of the Savage Divide. 
---
No clue honestly. I just remember the "sacrificial blade" mod was from the unique item in fallout 4, Kremvh's Tooth. The effect the mod gives might be marked as a "legendary effect" so the game just adds a star to the item, I bet its a glitch. They might intend to add a way to customize effects or add effects to legendaries in the future, idk
---
Maybe the fissures site are closing because there going to move them...think that would be kind of a cool idea and could change how different areas of them map feel depending on if the site is there or not
---
True the Explosive is the important and broken part with Shotguns. 
---
First fortune: You will encounter a client cr---
---
Nice! You should have ran to the nearest Port-A-Dinner after that encounter.
---
LOL Well hell, that's one way of summing it up. Good play on words there xD
---
Had an explosive 50cal, but now got my TSE lever action and 2shot Handmade. They've done me well. Was melee until getting them, liking rifle build now
---
Also when I saw the "whack-a-commie"... I was so sad :-(
---
Tip: When fighting protections, aim for the crotch for double damage
---
Its called The Outer Worlds XD
---
It's fine that you didn't get the point I was trying to make.
---
Sorry dude I completely missed this, I’ll add you next time in playing
---
That's fair but I'm lv 13 on my alt so ill have my own soon enough I'd even give you stuff to hang on to for security reasons
---
# Death Blossoms
---
Go to Location (Varied but seems to always be in the Forest Region) and when you enter you will see 5 Titan Arum (or Corpse Flowers) and a Timer will begin.
---
All you have to do is make sure the Plants Survive till the Timer ends, the more Plants you keep alive the more rewards you receive.
---
You fail if all Plants die.
---
Still going on friend! 
---
I saw Graham yesterday and he didn't have any. Also didn't know that was a thing. Thanks.
---
Yep not a bug, the game doesn’t follow the default sound device.  It works this way in FO4 too.
---
Hell yeah man good looking out ill try it
---
&gt; If you aren't wanted or haven't engaged in PvP, then you can't be "one-shot" it's just not how it works.
---
you're really, really stupid.
---
I was more worried about the black titanium, but it looks like the  "Lucky Strike" quests are repeatable. So I should be good.
---
Oooo I want one too.
---
My TSE lever does 840 base DMG without taking sneak attack, night, vat Crit or buffs into account. Thousands 
---
Yeah, I found a duper a few days ago and my team and I decided to make his night suck. Yeah, he killed us a lot, but we killed him more and wrecked his camp.
---
Relax, man. There's no need to get personal. It's common knowledge that FO76 crashes often. If it hasn't happened to you, that's great - but that doesn't negate other people's experiences.
---
That's news to me about the silos.  Unfortunately I didn't get a screenshot, but there was a physical change to them. I'll see if I can grab one and post it before heading to bed.
---
Great work, but too many close shades to really make good use of it... maybe drop Rhododenrums and Sootflowers? If this was interactive and we could toggle species, would be soooo wonderful!
---
I hadn't heard about the nukes until now, but I did notice there was an odd lack of nuke zones, which was weird since one of the weekly challenges is to make stable flux.
---
I would agree loot base games benefit from an economy. Yet games like Destiny don’t have an Economy. Economy doesn’t make a game like this better. Honestly I’m the end it hurts the grind of the game as Much as duping does.
---
Remember the game hasn’t even been out 2 months yet. During that time period we had thanksgiving and Christmas and New Years. Major holidays that subtract around 2 weeks worth a work.
---
Like I said patching and fixing things can be very complicated depending on the engine. Then it being a server based game makes it more complicated. In some server based games that have a major glitch or bug they can just turn off access to Said activity. Destiny did that a while back with trails of the nine because of a major game breaking exploit. That’s harder to die in that with this issue. You just can’t shutdown all the servers and prevent people from playing the game until bug exploit is fixed. Can you even think of the Hell that would be raised. Same as nuking all inventories. To much backlash.
---
The fact of the matter is. They have tried to fix the bug and exploit. As they are trying to fix and patch a lot of things in the game. Some things take longer then others. I worked as a game developer. We had a nasty bug in one of our games. Thankfully the public didn’t know or didn’t get exploited. Yet it took the engine coders 5 months to actually fix the root cause of the problem. We bought time with Bandaid patches till the true fix was finished and released.
---
The reason why it was so hard to fix and took so long wasn’t just an issue of budget. The coders has to rewrite about 35% of the engine code and then wrote another 40% code to fix the issue. Then you have to retest the code. Alpha and beta test to make sure there isn’t other major game breaking bugs. That’s why I said it might be a lot more complicated then that.
---
I understand your frustrations. Believe me I do. Had so many of those moments with Marvel Heroes Omega.
---
That's what I'm hoping for. I love it when companies do this to tease new content.
---
Yeah, I can definitely see myself putting a lot more hours into this with the crafting system. Grinding for loot on Fallout games was always a good time, and probably going to be exploring more so than anything else lol. I chose luck for my first skill card before leaving the Vault and got the Pharma farma perk, I think that was a good choice?
---
They better all energy weapons viable in the future
---
Another things I really enjoy about the game is the loot and enemies. There are a ton of different kinds. Everything from all the other fallout games and then some.
---
You have to take daily classes for at least a quarter, and they count absences /s
---
I’ve got the following suspicions.  Prove me wrong :) :
---
* If you or another player aren’t there, the game probably isn’t  thinking about physics at your camp at all.
---
* A corrolary to the above: if it’s your camp then the enemies probably spawned *because* you arrived, so of course the turrets weren’t attacking them before.
---
* Turrets don’t attack back enough (in public workshops some scorched may be plinking away at your turret from far away, but the turret doesn’t activate to fight back).  If the points above are true, though, they probably makes the situation better because this doesn’t happen if you or another player aren’t in the area.
---
Luck is always good! Yea there’s an insane amount of blue prints to find.
---
this is sorta how I've been making friends, chaining queens and inviting the people who stuck around to a fresh server
---
their common camp with marsupial wasn't near a billboard, was it? 
---
# Uranium Fever
---
Enter the Blackwater Mine and proceed straight (don't go down the Left side Tunnel, even though a ton of Molemen pour out from it) you will eventually be able to go right and it is within this area you should find 3 machines to protect.
---
You can repair mining machines if they take too much damage.
---
If all 3 are destroyed you don't fail automatically however the more machines working the more Uranium mined to fill the Bar.
---
The more full the bar is the more rewards you get.
---
I probably will do it some tomorrow. Seems to be going well. Your welcome to join if you’d like. You may have a queue. 
---
What if a faction player wants to the courier quest?
---
Raider faction:
---
- receive and steal package, kill courier, as in yourself 
---
Brotherhood/enclave 
---
- receive package (mission end) 
---
Yea if you like grinding loot then you’ll enjoy the game for sure.
---
Yeah, Bethesda seems like its deciding not to change it's bad decision making.
---
Remove nukes out??! Wtf is the game supposed to be?
---
If i knew how to code that i definitely would yea i dropped pinning rhodos and soots halfway thru because theres just way too many to even need to . And thats why i changed the shapw for the resin 
---
I did not know that. Thank you!
---
Well, it couldn't have been too lucky because I didn't have a chance to fight either of them
---
I bet Im not the only one to immediately look for Resin and Firecaps!
---
I didn't know that either. Thanks!
---
Hey!  You got some lead!  XD
---
I do the same thing to the prize bot.
---
"CONGRATU**BLAM** well...  more **THWIPP** since I use suppressors
---
Sometimes, a horde event marker stays in the map even though it has ended. If you fast travel to it, game will crash. If you fast travel nearby and walk to the event, the marker will be there but there is nothing else there.
---
Hmm fair point.
---
Play it again, my Johnny...
---
Lol i spent days looking for firecap theres a nice big chunk near joes
---
Its something i suppose &gt;.&lt; 
---
All the time especially plans.
---
Cant you just put them into your PA frame so they doesnt add up to your inventory weight?
---
I feel ya.
---
I haven't been on all day but I've seen a couple other posts talking about the silos. I might check it out myself in a little bit. I guess it could have been a bug or something Bethesda did to let new players visit Whitesprings (I dunno if I buy that, I keep having to jump servers to find it nuked), but the fact that they'd go through the trouble of creating collapsed versions of the sites makes me think they're doing something.
---
Ah, but one kind of attack?? Short range, long range, melee, high armor and/or swarm? Oh no he’s closing the distance and it looks like he’s a robot! Choose a new weapon quick!
---
It seems to mark high interest points as I have found places after using a lookout tower 
---
I'm shy so I leave things at the responder corpses by the vault, and in suitcases at train stations
---
Thanks mate, you've been an awesome help. Extremely encouraging and convinced me to take a real good hard look at this title. I know it might seem silly, but before this, the feedback about the game was just so hard to see beyond. I'm really relieved I went ahead and bought it regardless, because this does seem to be like my kind of game :)
---
I just cleared out Welch a few times and got it from scrapped Mole Miner Suits.
---
Lol 
---
I try to. They tend to either not enter trading with me or completely miss the greasy brown bag filled with cooked food and purified water.
---
Just a rumor. BGS confirmed there was no event, just a suggested meetup at the white springs. Nukesilos not working is just coincidence.
---
yeah. I might have agreed with him in the past, but after you play one competitive Mobile Game or a season of FIFA Ultimate Team, you realize there are a metric shit ton of people willing to whale up ANY price for their digital fixes. I don't correct anyone here, cos this game has both a price tag as well as an Atomic Shop, but this shit is small potatoes compared to what is going on out there in MOST microtransaction games. It's a whole new world out there.
---
Yeah that muhfugga is strong as F. But yeah it arrives to a set location where it will circle around, and if you can you can shoot up motors to slow / stop it.
---
Yep.  Just left some power armor and fusion core in Flatwoods.  Maybe it will help someone.
---
I only got 1...if your on ps4 and need 1 i can build it for u
---
Yea it can .
---
Did you actually learn the plan by clicking or activating it? Plans aren't just learned 
---
Sometimes enemies will clip below the floor making the ws uncapturable until they either respawn or you server hop
---
I second this motion and think it's a grand idea.
---
Another tip is if you see pins on a map in the world you can click them to add those locations to your map. 
---
I have found one map with "pins" where this didn't work but the implication was that the map was electronic so that might be why.
---
Nah didnt you read, he was dressed as Santa. Obviously he is Santa!
---
Yes agreed, I feel like the team claimed areas should be a B.A.S.E. And should mainly feature easier exchange / sharing of supplies and loot, and it would mean a presence even while logged off as a faction on the server. This would be cppp to have the roster team feature even if we can’t build a persisting base for it, that will let me bring community players together in one list instead of everyone needing to Friend list/ Join the friends. 
---
It'll ding your xp gain % (not by much) and the durability of crafted items
---
But the alarm sound. :(
---
No thanks.
---
It’s like this. I appreciate the effort. I really do. But time and again you see these promises of “hey, I compiled all the Fallout songs into one place!” 
---
And they’re not. At all. They’re a handful of *some* of the music, mixed with either the “same” song but a different artist, the same artist but a completely different recording of the same song, or bullsgit non-Fallout songs added in everywhere. I tried this station, and it’s guilty of all three.
---
Seriously, does anybody anywhere know of a legitimate, *actual* Fallout station that doesn’t take liberties, and had all of the actual original songs as used? I’d give anything for that.
---
I actaully tested it and laser trip wires wont trip on players, whether their hostile to you, or wanted. Its a bit disappointing.
---
Err, yeah something is wrong with your console.  Either that or you're just spouting inane hate. 
---
I'll apologize for not accepting any team invites. It's just that I prefer running solo. I uh kinda got conditioned from previous fallout games with companions either dying off easily (FO3) or they getting knocked out n being out of fight (FONV,  FO4, FO76)  yes even when I roam with my friends they go down faster than me n I'm not even using PA lol
---
Plus as kiwidust has stated maxed lone wanderer is a hell of a perk to drop.
---
You don't lose perk card benefits, but lose passive benefits. For example with intelligence, if you craft something with this debuff active it won't be as durable as it would without the debuff.
---
Look at the guys post history, hardly reputable.
---
I used a unmodded furious 10mm smg on the SBQ when she landed one time, you could actually see her health going down with it... wish I had modded it and had more ammo at the time, I’d say they are ok, gonna try it again soon lol
---
Definitely hotel trivago. There's no other explanation.
---
See, I dunno. I've had to sit and jump server after server to find Whitesprings nuked sometimes.
---
Plus, if the fissure sites are collapsed, that means they went through the trouble of creating new models to represent collapsed sites. And considering at least 75% of this game is ripped from Fallout 4, the fact that they actually bothered to create something new suggests there may be more to the silos being closed...
---
But idk maybe they managed to slap FO4 assets together to produce a collapsed site and they've got nothing.
---
At the very least, some paint for non power armor and weapons that aren't always goofy looking.  Maybe some armor skins too.  Raider armor made from old tire tread, metal armor made from road signs, etc. Post-apocalyptic looking. 
---
Only one worth using.  You can't get the hunting rifle as legend so it's the pipe or the gauss.  Pipe requires less perks for the same output.
---
I got your point. Everyone should shut up because this is the future of AAA titles. If you don't like it, stop playing games or just pretend everything is fine.
---
Same here.  I'm bad about getting sidetracked while on a quest by events.  I tend to have a short att- oh look a quarter!
---
Get fucked. 
---
Here's a photo. Just walked right up to it without a Scorchbeast bursting out or swooping down. [https://imgur.com/a/8rDo5fV](https://imgur.com/a/8rDo5fV)
---
In what way?
---
Hm. It's just rocks, so maybe it is a temporary thing.
---
Where do you get them all? 
---
This is a really good idea. I like it alot
---
I like the idea in generell, just want to hear more ideas on what-if-other-factions do it 
---
Int does not affect exp gain in fo76.
---
And you 1 shot people who are not wanted? My TSE 2200 damage black dragon doesnt. Wonder why.
---
I spent a couple hours last night running around in a tuxedo and party hat, giving away liquor and the old Legendary armor pieces that were cluttering my stash to level-appropriate players as a pre-New Years gift. 
---
Not sure if juat bullshitting or not but from what i remember intelligence doesnt affect xp in this game only previous.
---
Thia change?
---
PC Xbox or PS4 
---
Just ignore/block them or join a new server.  Simple.
---
I have the same issue. Where do you farm for cores? 
---
You retain the benefit of the arms. Just not the +100 carry weight. 
---
Yeah I was minding my own business and I got killed and lost 53 caps
---
How about, cargo bot drops off said package, (new Nuke codes each week?) Then the faction that gets there ,claims package and delivers it back to a designated spot gets the rewards.
---
Theres a railroad map in one (maybe more) of the stations that will mark the other stations if you haven't been to them yet.
---
Possibly. I highly doubt it's for the sake of new players, though, so maybe we'll see some kind of new end game event like Scorched Earth?
---
Nah. Less time farming at camp more time exploring.  You find water on the go, thats why its called a survival game. Here come the downvotes...
---
But where do I get a recipe for frog legs? 
---
I spent 2 weeks with a 10 cap bounty on me because I accidentally broke into a resource farmer before I knew it was a bad thing. A couple days ago I logged in and some asshole immediately teleported to me after gathering his rocket launcher and proceeded to destroy my power armor and my entire base. Before that I had ammo issues and screw issues. So the weapons I do have cant be used and I cant create new ones or armor cause I have no screws nor the mats to repair my base, And you cant server jump farm screws either. You have to wait for a hard reset. So the game is basically unplayable for me.
---
YOU SHUT YOUR FILTHY MOUTH
---
THAT IS AN AMAZING SONG
---
Would pay 3000 atoms for a riot gear/desert ranger combat armor set.
---
Hell, I'd also like to just get weapon camos. Those were datamined ages ago, I think even before launch. I'm pretty sure the recent camo combat armor skin even came with pictures that included a camo hunting rifle that were later removed, unless I'm going insane. 
---
This would be an awesome idea and should totally be an organized thing.
---
I am now looking into coding an interactive map as it might be easier than doing this the way i am doing lol.
---
Yeah, set it to Area chat in your options
---
I had one guy, bout the same level, 30 or so, follow me back to my camp after I declined a team invite.  He comes up and starts bashing all my benches with a super sledge. I was holding a sword, (just came back from low level mats run..don’t waste ammo) so maybe he didn’t think I had any decent gear.  Switched to Handmade and Swiss-cheesed his ass quick.   I mean WTF...some people.
---
Yeah, the levels in Nuke Zones are a problem then.
---
Radiation is the main survival hazard/challenge in this survival game, so it shouldn't be totally surmountable. But since Nuke Zones are the endgame content (for now), having them just be a straight "gEt F---ed" to every build except one is kind of a setback.
---
I'd assume leadlined armour probably has some viability in PvP against gamma gun/radium rifle users, but thats is own tangled mess of questionable design and near-nonexistent balance.
---
No problem. Honestly if I would have waited, not bought it at launched and then went by what people were saying about the internet I’d be concern as well. Lucky I preordered it with the belief if it’s anything like fallout 4 then I’d love it because that’s a game I played until I had literally nothing left to do. A online fallout game sounded like the perfect game for me. 
---
I would love for them to add the Scorched Sierra Power Armor from Fallout New Vegas and the Tribal Power Armor from Fallout 3.  I loved those Power Armors because they looked awesome and would look better with the new Power Armor system.  New original ideas similar in nature would be nice too.
---
I would also love if they added “player skins” so you could look like a Ghoul, Glowing Ghoul, or a Scorched.  I am tired of playing as a simple human quite honestly.
---
There's no incentive for them, so I believe you're overstating the possible effects. It's not like EvE, where cheating is fueled by the intrinsic laziness of players wanting to speed up the grind and the greed of leaders of large corps and alliances wanting to monetize the game, and where punishment is complicated by the fact those cheaters pay a monthly subscription fee (often on numerous accounts). Here, there's no incentive for BGS to look the other way and only rarely glance over to catch a few people cheating. I imagine BGS will simply nuke the accounts of anyone duping, and with no monetary gain for the cheaters to justify that risk, they'll become a rarity once the game is stabilized.
---
Same to you! take care.
---
Yes, go to your settings and select 'area' for chat.
---
As long as ur not in a party chat u can use area chat
---
I don't see how an event called uranium fever solves the issue of the song not being in the game
---
Im using it as evidence that they should have the song in the game
---
Replying for easy access later
---
Original XB1 or XB1X?
---
I have been finding that it seems like the majority of Xbox issues have been occurring on the original XBOX and not the XB1X. 
---
I saw this a lot over the last year with PUBG (also a PC port). It seemed to either perform better on one or the other.   Was wondering if the same thing was happening with FO76. 
---
I play on a XB1X and have not experienced any of these crashes that I am seeing in this subreddit. 
---
I do occasionally suffer from a disconnect, but it’s less than one every couple days and I typically play on the same server for 3+ hours at a time. 
---
On x1 thx tho
---
Imo the gatlings and tesla are fine. The laser rifle and gatling plasma need a condition buff to actually last more than 2 clips each. I haven't used the plasma rifle much yet since they patched it but afaik the only issue is that the damage is a bit underwhelming. Alien blaster is just...fucking awful
---
Was it just the handmade plan or was it a scope or some other mod for it?
---
Same exact shit happened to me, a 45 and a 35 attacked me so I shot him back expecting to destroy him with a TSE handmade but no they killed me in 3 hits even though I'm more than twice their levels 
---
I guess I can be thankful that there have been updates since before I started, and by the sounds of it, there's another big one coming over the month. The good thing about online games is that they are regularly built upon with patches/improvements and new content in most cases. In that sense, it's only uphill from here, right lol.
---
I always get confused about the layout and locations of everything needing to be repaired.  Takes me a lot longer than 10 minutes.
---
That happens a lot at the charleston landfill
---
Herpes.
---
But also ammo and plans!
---
Yup, that's where I learned about it, lol
---
It is time for wood /leather / combat armor to disappear from the loot list of late game enemies. Personally I wouldn't want to see any but power armor mods or stuff from them but I hear some blasphemers deny PA
---
Whaaaaa? Thats awesome.
---
I was level 7 just claimed a workshop by junkyard built turrets and was scrounging nearby for supplies 2 people over level 20 claimed my workshop while I was away by the time I got back ... guess I shouldn’t have walked they took it over and I got wrecked by my own turrets which they now own.  I fought back killed one but couldn’t get thru the turrets to claim it back.
---
&gt; I have a feeling the recipe system just can't support the idea of "This OR that." I can't think of any instance that proves otherwise.
---
Well yes, it can. Every time you craft something the materials that will get used are shown, and this might include scrapping a bulk steel or x01 calibrated shock to make the next bullets.
---
Purified water could be allowed to "scrap" into boiled water.
---
I see invites but usually have no way of responding to them. Maybe others are broken to?
---
Try staying in areas suggested for those levels.
---
Check your inventory.  Sometimes a piece ends up there after a blue screen or something.
---
Sort of related, but the name issue does appear to be by name only. I figured this out thanks to another glitch, the one where legendary enemies flee you. I found a diseased glowing gulper that kept on running away from me. It restored all its health eventually and ended up dropping a nocturnal boxing glove. It had all the characteristics of a legendary, but it did not have any stars or legendary in the name. 
---
wish i could find a perk that reduced the deteration oe melee weapons
---
I think it's time we all admit that Bethesda's anti-griefing strategy has failed, and they need to find other ways to discourage griefers that the current bounty mechanic.  The roaming parties of "person with a bounty" and their friends waiting to either kill you, or get rich by killing them has turned out to be more of an annoyance than simple griefers ever could have been.
---
Same here, especially after they make the "humans are weak" comment XD
---
Actually it is herd. I forgot I had it. Something about it keeps me below 3 charisma and cancels the share when I start moving. If I equip magnetic personality then I can share normally.
---
Well this is directed towards settlements. Events happen where you gotta go and defend it meaning there’ll be enemies there regardless. There has been plenty of times where I’m busy in some far away area to just leave and defend only to come find out when I go back and retake it, my turrets are just sitting around doing nothing. As far as my encampment, there has been times where it has been attacked and I have to repair all of the damage and yet my turret is unscathed and sitting idle. Enemies will usually go for generators and resource gatherers first unless the turret happens to work, then they’ll be attacking that instead. 
---
I'm just the opposite.  Everything I hate about it is because it's online.  When I want to go quest I have to pick a place on the map with no players who might have killed everything already.  I just hate running into other players.  All the lag, all the getting dropped from servers, looting lag, anti modding from Bethesda is all because it's online.  Ruins it.
---
[Yeah i too hate, they use twitter](https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1080188836993515521)
---
Other then powerleveling there shouldn’t be any reason for a lvl 85 to be grouped with 10-40 
---
I can only assume it is done that way to prevent exploits 
---
As in fighting level 100 enemy for his loot with your level 100 character is too hard? 
---
Pop in a single level 5 in your team (doesn’t need to be physically there) and suddenly the enemy is 47/48. At the same time there will be a market for level level characters AFK’ing in your group 
---
I'd like a ghoul skin.
---
When I did it disappeared. It was on my power armor when I got in then when I check it was off again. It does it with all of my power armor sets
---
Exactly its dumb I was twice their level and they just come and molest me 
---
That goddamn prize bot floated up to me while I was creepy-crawling past a nest of Mirelurk Kings and nearly got us both killed.  I just up and sprinted away to the sounds of it congratulating me on my luck while they ripped it to pieces.
---
Yeah I’ve been wearing that butt ugly garb of mysteries and would enjoy being able to have the benefits and not look like a crack addict
---
Bold of you to assume that Bethesda:
---
Has the tools to actually track it.
---
Has the audacity to ban players when the active player base is so small
---
Cares in the slightest
---
Will patch the actual dupe glitches instead of putting bandaids or hot fix caps over it
---
Won’t just have a new one pop up as soon as new content is released
---
Will implement a decent report system
---
Doesn’t have bigger fish to fry
---
Would know anything about why people are duping.
---
Would care to look at the loot system and notice that it is completely awful.
---
I feel the same way, I know Whitesprings spawns a lot of enemies but I can play for hours across dozens of sessions and never see it nuked.
---
But it does feel a little early to move on from the endgame. Sure, plenty of people are at that point where they're ready to move on, but the game just came out a month ago and there are new players who have to get there. Hell, they could have just shut them down to work on Scorched Earth.
---
I dunno, it could really go either way. As long as it's not a fucking Scorchbeast King, I'll be fine.
---
Camp McClintock has like 20 ballistic fiber in it. Loot it and Server hop you can have like 200 ballistic fiber in an hour or so
---
Had three at a farm and kept dying until I managed to lead one away by luck and remove it, then sniped the other two down with armor piercing then shotgunned in their faces. Bloody hard but great fun. Auto stim perk was essential with lots of them.
---
They are I guess OP as at this strength they would dominate the wastes barring ScorchBeasts of course.
---
Also, I repaired an ultracite leg so I could just use it and when I did it took the materials but still won’t let me use it. It’s honestly frustrating
---
/nod emote
---
Nah, that song is in the commercial. 
---
Well at least you weren't salty
---
Yes. Got at least 70+ stimpaks cluttering the stash.
---
&gt; reseting quest progress and character stats/effect maybe a little more involved.
---
Actually it's incredibly simple to do using the console commands. There are even very detailed instructions on the wiki.
---
Disease? Lost mutation? Any debuff whatsoever?
---
Listen here you scrub, it's almost heaven
---
You could get rich! One cap at a time :p
---
(This was a joke, but on reflection I'm now picturing people spending an hour of their living just drinking cola to earn caps, which has made me sad).
---
To play with a friend and have fun?
---
Can confirm Lever Gun at both Grafton and in the ash heap (Lewisburg and Welch). I got Lever Gun at all 3 places. I was level 40+ and was server hoping for Calibrated Shocks. 
---
Handmade will show up at Harper’s ferry or Watoga Train Station vendor at levels 15-19 ONLY.  I can confirm I started Server hoping on my main at 27 for around 100+ hops checking both vendors and never saw them. Created a level 16 alt and have gotten dozens of Handmade plans from Watoga. Usually one in every 5 or less Server hops. 
---
Me too. Super annoying. 
---
how would you track duplicated items as far as the servers and game engine is concerned another weapon has been introduced within an infinite amount of weapons there are no unique markers for weapons, and how would a players know if the have bought or are buying a duplicate so you take there duplicated explosive 15k shotgun but now you have two salty players and one that has a right to be. One solution for this I can having all the weapons have a unique serial number in the code that way if it gets duplicated the server can search for that and you get banned.        
---
Possibly suffering from a disease or had you used a consumable that boosts strength previously ?
---
Also, Perk card swapping messes me up all the time.
---
Do you think this is a local issue? I don’t generally have these issue with other games. Something to keep consider I guess. Even so you should be able to join the same server and pick up where left. And one of the 3 was a complete game freeze. Not sure that was connection related 
---
I feel like importing the whole FO4 map wouldn’t be that difficult. Just update the map here and there. Take out NPCs with robots and add in quests and what not. But I could be wrong lol 
---
It does from One guy tests.
---
Even at my expense, it’s funny.... I still like the game haha
---
I have no shotgun or explosive perks, the tse shotgun still oneshots. 
---
Not to mention that melee works the same with much less lag and latency.
---
How many screws do you think are there? From what items?
---
Literally everything you describe is intended gameplay.  Workshops are PVP content.  The game warned you with a modal dialog box before you even took the thing!
---
I mean, what did you even build those turrets for if you didn't think you'd have to fight for it?
---
Nope, cat 6 through out my home, 100/50mbps connection. Normally decent ping
---
Ok thanks
---
Oh my god no. That didnt work.
---
Oh though you know what's worried I keep joint servers and the one place I always go to Is almost never claimed and yet frequently has stuff already built there
---
But its like talking to Bane...  "Urrgh gruhhuuuh"
---
*Sometimes when I enter the Watoga EMS building, farming legendary gear, after I hit the elevator button to enter the screen fades to black, then the 76 logo pops up in the corner for a second before the pinging vault logo shows up stutters a bit and then the game locks up.*
---
This precisely, black screen but can hear whatever spawns in the cell, muties or Wendigo, loading spinner frozen, just Windows key, Task View and 2nd Virtual desktop to Task Manager and kill FO76.
---
Not got into that building yet.
---
Yep and they level 100 and your like 20.
---
Lol I had fun but I do have a question they can claim a work shop and they can walk by your turrets and don’t get attacked by claiming it what other traps are good for delaying them 
---
Yep. That’s how my night ended. 
---
How so?
---
I have to agree , not defending duping. But i have one lvl 78 &amp; one lvl 158 character...not a single usable drop on either ffs! I thoughy wth i buy a good weapon via the bazaar. Now i can actually play the game when i have a weapon and dont need to worry about getting something to defend myself with when looking for msts. Hell i even had time to start getting into house building cause no need to run whitesprings all the time! Just my opinion
---
Nothing.  Your equipment is carrying you.  The build itself has low DPS against things without heads.
---
Found the duper. Who doesnt understand this is an mmo and not a single player game. 
---
People already do that. Community-established dump spots are cash registers next to vendors, the suitcases outside the whitesprings main entrance, the lunchbox at the watoga train station, and the overseer's camp.

I finally found somebody today who used both the register and the lunchbox at the watoga station. It might have been two separate people actually, since both had different kinds of ammo. I decided to leave a good 50 stims in there in exchange for the ammo I took
---
I was going to say this is pretty stupid but then I remember the time machine testing site I found so its possible
---
After seeing my camp being blown up twice by (the same) much higher level players for shit and giggles, I only place the bare necessities on ground - this also makes it easier for other players to access benches and stash without having to destroy my poor front door 
---
The thing I'm salty about is that I lose 50 caps for no reason I understand its pvp content 
---
If your guy is sad on the status screen, you're probably addicted to something.  
---
I do, but this has happened to me many times, and my frustration got the better of me....
---
Someone doesnt understand how programming works. Its provably false that they said this causes problems.
---
Xbox 
---
True, I've seen those before as well. Also, sometimes the effect off a Pulse Mines going off, it will display just a "green screen color" color and most of the times it makes the game crash.
---
I've only been playing for a couple days too, and I'd say go for it!  If you like FO, you'll get at least some enjoyment out of it.
---
I've run into a few weird bugs/glitches, but nothing game-breaking (yet) and nothing that makes the fun completely stop.  My complaint right now is that the map/server always feels so empty.  I'm a really low level, so I only ever see high-level PCs on the other side of the map and no one I could potentially group up with.
---
The turrets are useless to other players they just walk right by them and claim without being attacked I just didn’t realize I guess 
---
I can give you some.  Message me sometime GT:  Centurion EL1TE
---
If you find the higher versions lemme know and I could put the paint job on for you if you want
---
This might not be it, but I have noticed that you have to have headsets/mics plugged in, on, and set as the device you're using before you click play in the launcher. If you switch them on or plug them in afterwards it will keep using your speakers and mics might not work.
---
I also was working with someone today, I had area chat on and they had team chat on. When we teamed up we couldn't hear each other but when he set his to area to match mine we could
---
I still don't totally get it but maybe that will help 
---
Not sure if that would be more or less satisfying for me.
---
This is such dhit game
---
Except thats a horrible idea and theres alot of items that you can accumulate over 1000 of. I keep storing shit on a mule and it has 1000s of wood and steel on it. You know how easy it is to get that shit? God im glad they dont listen to people like you.
---
I notice weird changes. Give or take 100 with excavator armor. My normal carry weight is like 230ish, with my excavator and no shocks it should go up 100. Sometimes I have almost 500 carry weight though. No idea what the reason is.
---
Often, I feel like completely destroying c.a.m.p's next to the Charleston store as they stop the rare vendor bot from spawning....I haven't yet...but maybe one day...
---
Ok this could work but this could be severely unbalanced. It's totally possible that you have 15 BoS guys and 2 responders and a few of the others and then obviously Boss wins. I'm just saying that they would have to balance how many of one faction can be on the server.
---
I think the 10mm has higher armor penetration than the pipe pistol. I have a hardened piercing 10mm and a hardened piercing pipe pistol and the 10mm does more damage.
---
Best tip I can give you is have fun and play your way, another commenter mentioned team up (I highly agree with this due to game crashes and disconnects). 
---
Don't worry about taking workshops much they got nerfed and don't dishout enough stuff to be worth it (ammo plant is an exception (top middle of the map))
---
Place your camp near water. This will allow you to build a water purifier when you get the plans for it.
---
Power up some power plants (this allows you to get the fusion generator which gives you 100 power.)
---
Trade with people you know and trust, there's lots of assholes that found an exploit in the game that allows them to steal your legendary weapons and armor or even take all your inventory. Watch out for people that you've never met trying to trade with you. This is a red flag for now.
---
On one of the overseers quests (it may still be bugged) [spoiler] the one where you kill Evan [/spoiler] may require you to server hop to find a location where he isn't harmed.
---
Take on the good with salt perk as soon as possible (it's in luck) this will make your food expire 90% slower
---
Do NOT toss spoiled meat, fruit or vegetables use a Chem station to make it into fertilizer which is used to plant or sell for caps.
---
At your camp plant corn, mutfruit and tatos these and purified water will allow you to make vegetable starch which can be an adhesive (it's hard to find early on. 
---
And my last tip is to play your way, don't use all my tips or others, all I ask is that you acknowledge these tips that I and others have found and use them to find your own playstyle. 
---
How did this work out for you.  What about no Four Leaf Clover?   Is the gauss ok or is another riffle better for this build?
---
Nobody would/could successfully sue Bethesda for a frame rate fix. It's a general performance fix
---
 Bethesda could confirmed they are fixing the Lever Gun reload animation in the next Jan patch. 
---
Quote:  “In mid-January, we will be releasing another patch that contains many fixes, including fixes for the Lever-Action Rifle reload animation, some perk cards, and we’re dealing some crowd control at the Whitespring by implementing a fix for the robots duplicating on the resort grounds. Full patch notes will be available at a later date that covers all the fixes featured in this update.”

Interesting
---
Every playthrough of fo3 I'd rush the Pitt for the pa and predator gun. I can understand if they don't want us to be scorched, but if we can mutate I think ghoul skins are more than reasonable.
---
All 18 and you just turn into a walking flesh pile
---
I never made a twitter, it'd be nice if there was a bot that linked their updates. I think I seen bots like that.
---
Yeah, I'm still enjoying a bunch of the mid-game content even at level 90; haven't even killed the Queen, yet, and I've only launched one nuke. I know a lot of people are complaining about there being nothing to do once you kill the Queen enough, but I doubt they're just gonna add one event in if they're actually doing something.
---
Sadly odds are they won't... They need licenses for the music. And that cost $$.
---
2 insurmountable issues with that: your SB wouldn't be able to carry anything more than your weight very far so you'd arrive at your location with nothing more than a loin cloth and a spear.
---
Also the farts are kind of hard to get over. Would you really be ok with everything you own smelling like that forever, let alone the constant risk of disease.
---
Yea well this game is only going to get better which is awesome because I love fallout so much.  I’m can’t wait to see the patch notes for the next one and find out what this new restriction free pvp is all about. 
---
I am rubber, you are glue.
---
In a perfect world, probably an instigating bloodied +1 strength super sledge 
---
I'm having a great time. But I would reccomend waiting till it's hit the 6 month mark. BGS still has work to do.
---
Dont know the route, but I did meet him inside Whitesprings once, along the path leading up to the mini fire station in there
---
Um, lots of people was talking about it here on this reddit too.  And yeah people are dicks on internet.
---
I was like that at the start. 45 to 50mins to complete it. Just go there everytime you get a chance. Here is a fun fact to help you out. Once you get the windmill plan on a character, read it. Then you get the large generator or the fusion core generator. If you learn the large gen you can only obtain the fusion generator. And vice versa. Once you learn all 3 though, you can not get any more plans as a reward. So. If you are trying to sell the fusion core generator as a source of income, they go for about 1k to 2k depending on the person buying it... then only learn 2 the 2 you want so that you can sell one of the three over and over per each completion of the event. 
---
Hope this helps and earns you some caps! If you enjoyed that, I love karma :p
---
Nice. 
---
Turn off all your objectives and wait a few minutes and it will show you the location of the enemy in question. If it's some mole rat burrowed too deep just fast travel back.
---
I knew it!  I knew they took more than one song out but I could only think of Grandma Plays the Numbers
---
Was gonna say the best thing they could do is treat the next few months like another (actual) beta getting the polish this game really needs in and server wipe. But creating seperate shards is a much better "make everyone happy" solution i think.
---
I used too but then a glitch. Happened where when I dropped my favorite level 20 anti-armor revolver I've used since the beta it just vanished into the void I've been too afraid to drop anything 
---
I'm not sure if there's another way to do it, but the only way I've been able to respond is by opening my map and right-clicking on the player who sent the invite.  There's an "Accept Party Invite" button there.
---
You can get close with vanguard armor, yah you lose hp when you get hit and therefore lose defense, but it's the highest stats I've found for normal armor and actually passes power armor with a few perks.
---
Ahhhaa! You are a stink boyfriend. Makeup then buy her some makeup. Introduce her to Lil Green the song "Why Dont You Do Right" she should sing it back to you. 
---
I've set my main goal as finding at least the knight paint... not going so well atm though 
---
So far ive only seen a single player on PC with this paint plan. Must be ungodly rare, or some secret none of us peasants know yet.
---
I made a flamingo jam band with my last base lol.. Looking to make something new now... Been kinda stuck on where to build my next camp tho... Soooo many places to pick from xD
---
Bot..bots. lol
---
Same button on xbox
---
Quality reference. 
---
Yah was going to say the same, plus its still bugged giving another 100 weight on login if u logged put in it until you get out.  Sitting at 565 carry weight.
---
It is ok but not nearly as good as it was in past games.
---
Btw makes it hard to want to wear any other armor ever.
---
Marine Wetsuit with shadowed combat armor is a fantastic look.
---
Could those exist, have you found any variations of these?
---
I'd be 100% willing for them to just scrap and re-do the entire loot table.  For everything.
---
There are so many thematic ones, but those are often up for debate.  I think a lot of wasteland junk in the Whitesprings trash cans makes no damn sense, but someone might think it's alright, maybe other survivors and vault dwellers chucked stuff in over time.  Fine.
---
But *size* of items in loot tables is literally inarguable.  You cannot fit a mop into a footlocker.  Especially not one *made of wood.*
---
Ive had my own turrets attack me or even each other.
---
Were you able to harvest/find them after completing the side quest: An Organic Solution?
---
A witch hunt lol, early when the game released I will admit a good bit of people who played or didn’t were shaming it wrongly but I feel like a lot of the criticism now is just, the game released in a buggy state and still has major bugs , it doesn’t offer anything truly special imo either, I’m glad your enjoying it though i just wish people in this sub could stop taking any criticism this game has faved as unjust or a witch hunt 
---
Wasn't there a lot of stuff recently about players being banned for mods?  I'd love to use this mod, but would hate getting banned :(
---
Player bending was really good tho :)
---
And all the girls say he's pretty fly.
---
So you guys had the jetpacks before you had the suits? I have had the suit forever and still cant find the jetpacks because they never sell them in the bunker. Checked every single time I disconnect :,(
---
Sorry for a late reply but thanks!
---
For the first time I noticed civilian-dressed scorched today at both Riverside Manor (wearing dresses) and Pleasant Ski resort (wearing toques) I can’t remember seeing that before. 
---
Going up to it being all like, cool what does this do? Nothing.
---
FO76 is missing a crucial step in the leveling process, which is incremental and plannable gearing. In something like WoW, you get the following steps:
---
* Level
---
* Dungeon Gear
---
* Raid
---
FO76 is missing step 2. In its place we have a literal crapshoot, random drops from random mobs with no account for playstyle. Further, step 3 is not balanced to require step 2. A level 1 character could, in theory, run over to the final boss, tag it, and get some loot, assuming that enough contributors join in to compensate for their lack of damage output.
---
I am enjoying the game for what it is, but it is severely lacking in meaningful end-game.
---
Only marsupial and I've had that for ages. No disease or addictions. 
---
Is it spoiling?
---
Thanks! Will try that
---
Could be a difference between PC/console.
---
Yep. Also 16 tons.
---
I want a baseball slide when I go from running to crouch. Could be an agi perk
---
Hmmm... I happened to be in the white spring by chance early this morning and the only thing I noticed was the robotics rooms manufacturing robots out of control...there was about 30 receptionists behind the desk they were starting to just die off for no reason.... maybe they got two strokes off Jerry’s golf game
---
I agree they should be talking more about changes/fixes coming new content ect...that being said I don't think 76 should be compared to NMS BGS didn't lie about anything (correct me if I'm wrong) like NMS it's not really BGSs fault people didn't listen to the warnings about bugs and this being a different type of FO game
---
The extractors used to be really really solid. Youd get something like 60 aluminum or lead per hour and 16 fusion cores. It was ridiculous. Now, most of the workshops are ghost towns...
---
Is it just from turning in tech documents and doing BoS events?
---
We both found them early on around 5-10 and just had them stashed away. We built the suits this evening.
---
Thanks. I'll keep an eye out.
---
I searched for it in the .esm and it was nowhere to be seen, so at least for now it does not exist in 76.
---
As far as i know its only from tech docs
---
Yes I know people do this. But you just listed off a bunch of different locations, some in some higher level areas. Lunch pails and registers etc. 
---
That was my point exactly. We need this done in lower level areas, a universally safe place. 
---
A level 5 isn't going to know to check a vendor register down in the cranberry bog. 
---
By using the overseers caches in the safest two spots, all players will have access. 
---
By organizing a special day of the week to do it, will possibly for habits in game, for non reddit users, to join in. 
---
If they log in every Friday and see the same two caches full of extra goodies the idea can pick up steam and become routine. 
---
Or we could maybe in a future update become ghouls or even super mutants
---
He is having his friends join as anyone can join you on xbox without being your friend. He is then stalking her to destroy her base so blocking is not working, and neither is leaving the server and joining a new one. 
---
And in which fallout game was this? I have them all minus the tactics for Xbox.
---
I'm not doubting you I think I may have missed that location
---
My heart is set on paladin but like you its not goung so well
---
Yeah!  It's the compass's fault I'm always lost!....
---
Maybe not NCR (lore) but riot gear in general
---
The smell is rough, not gonna lie. Scorchy tends to smell like sulfur gone bad. The good news is, it keeps a lot of curious vault dwellers away from my CAMP. Also, my Plague Walker mutation is loving the perks I get from soaking up a few extra germs. That’s why I always make sure to give Scorchy a big ol’ hug when she’s being a good girl.
---
I have to say, I like the idea of half-naked spear throwers torturing Appalachia from the skies. Maybe I’ll finally get around to crafting those throwing knives.
---
...have we actually ever done the Restoring Power event to all the power stations simultaneously yet? I mean by law of odds it must have happened but-- that feels like something that'd unlock a *thing* in any other game. 
---
I've only tried the Caps Stash one so far. I quite like the noise, but I know as soon as I hear it I'm probably going to waste ten minutes trying to find it, especially if it's on a different level.
---
Hell if I find any paint but initiate id gladly share with anyobr who wants it. All i have is initiate thi
---
Same
---
Hopefully more people will see this post. It would be great if this was a routine community event.  Would this post be allowed in the fo76bazaar sub? 
---
Either you didn't read the plan so you haven't learned it or you bought the plan for a mod.
---
Agreed, I did enjoy my time but I've hit the point of not seeing anything new at all and yet still seeing some of the same bugs since beta, every single play session. Not to mention dcs and lag. I do still think the game can be improved but I think they need to speed it up a bit.
---
This right here. I like and approve of this. Maybe in the future the outer worlds and fallout could become linked and be controlled by the good fallout creators, I'm looking at you interplay also known as Obsidian
---
In regards to passing the workshop on to another, yes. It's funny u say this, cause a few people and myself did that. So randomly one night i was playing solo, and decided to go take over a workshop to get those other random rewards you were talking about, plus i needed some steel anyways. So i decided to head to the ammunition plant, which i noticed someone already took it over and had it running. As i was about to leave, to try another workshop, the owner who had a mic, said he was logging off, and if i wanted i could. So he invited me to group, then logged off. Leaving me the sole owner of the plant. I continued as usual. About after an hour, a couple came to the ammunition plant. They were newish to game and much lower lvl then me. We got to talking... Told them i was kinda farming steel. They needed ammo. They were nice enough to drop some bulked steel for me, so i invited them to my group. I told them make whatever ammo you need, and any other resources you need. I just need steel. Since they helped me, i made a few extractors for them to get what they needed. After defending a few waves, the couple said they were gonna take over the red rocket stop, as it was nearby. I said ok... And that they did. So for about 4 hours we were together farming and defending each workshop, back n forth. Unfortunately it was time for them to go... So they logged off. Which left me as sole owner of both workshops. After about another hr or so, as i was about to log, a random player came to the red rocket stop on his travels. I asked if he was interested in the workshops. He said yes. So i invited him to group, and then left. Which made him the sole owner... Not sure how long he was on tho... But everyone got what they wanted, and was fun socializing and defending with others... 
---
It's broken. There are posts all over the sub with info about it. I believe they're going to try and fix it tomorrow
---
Sometimes...when I'm lonely at night...I consider using....I MEAN *coughs...Never used it.  
---
I wonder if the revival stranger stacks with the armor revival perk to make you nearly immortal though...
---
So the master?
---
This is wishful thinking with blissful ignorance.  I personally would volunteer for a game wipe despite how much I've earned but a total game wipe is the only way to fix this.  The game want designed or programmed to assign individual item ID codes but rather an ID code per item type.  Like a non legendary gauss rifle is ID xxxx1 Then your non legendary gauss rifle would have the same item ID as mine.  There is literally no way to tell which items where duped and which were actually earned.  
---
The first dupe bug Bethesda fixed in under 12 hours after I reported it on Twitter.  They dropped the ball when they discovered the second dupe bug and let the servers stay active for a week before fixing it.  Both major dupe bugs were reported withing hours of discovery but actions were not taken quickly enough.  
---
However this should not stop you from being a true merchant.  Collect gear for your shop inventory via drops.  Buy low from the official Xbox Fallout 76 club or what ever system you use to buy and sell currently.  Just because some people have hundreds of thousands of caps and nuka cola won't stop you as a merchant from succeeding.  All the duping did was floor the economy so horrible that it changed the value of goods to be significantly cheaper.  So long as you follow the flooded market value you should be successful anyways.  Start off by buying bulk nuka cola at 1 cap per 2 or 3 colas.  Your that have massive bulk cola don't want to spend hours drinking/converting the colas to caps.  It's beneficial to them to sell 2000 colas for 1000 caps.  And you can open 1000 colas in under 10 minutes.  Just go to the enclave or the waste treatment plant to use the free decontamination shower to heal rads for free.
---
Sure the duping hurt the game but it's all to easy to adapt and succeed making the duping issue beneficial.
---
There is a random encounter in Fallout 2 that lets you travel back in time.
---
Nope, no one but you. Including the dozens of people who've posted the exact same thing over the last 24 hours.
---
There are multiple vendors with cash registers in the forest, and I did mention the overseer's camp. There's only so many places where we can store loot...there are hundreds of big, "popular" areas in the game and usually only around 20 people on a server. 
---
Welcome to the new years event. No nukes, but free marketing for Bethesda. ;)
---
Server hopping Whitesprings nuke zones levelled me up nearly 20 times in two-ish hours. They'll patch this eventually I think, sadly.
---
I dont have it but the people I play with have used it and I swear he pops up but doesn't shoot anything. Or comes in after things are dead. 
---
It happens to a lot of guys.  Get some rest and maybe you'll be able to launch tomorrow.
---
Did you lose a member of your team? Losing shared perks can mess wit your carry weight significantly.
---
If you log in while wearing the excavator armor it gives you an extra 100 carry weight. So 200 total. If you enter it normally you’ll only get the intended 100. 
---
Thank you good sir, I shall now spread the good news among the other kingdoms 
---
Pip pip and cheerio 
---
Fallout 76, it's one of the pylons in the cranberry bog, you find notes about a scientist trying to use the mono rail high speed to travel through time/dimensions and one of the mono rail arcs has a shitload of radiation as in you need a Hazmat or PA to not die from it
---
At least I found the BoS Hood today, one step closer to the brotherhood feel 
---
See, this is one of the reasons we need a real, and text-based, communication system in the game.
---
I mean if I can magically see and be seen by everyone anywhere on the map - whether I want to or not - then I should be able to type a damn message like "need to log for the night, anyone want to come take over the power plant?"
---
I’m Just Sitting Here Wondering Why You Didn’t Capitalize The First Letter Of Every Word (Including The Parentheses) 
---
I was just watching a video on it. The guy had a decent build with a furious handmade rifle. No other effects and he just tore stuff up.
---
Wasn't this supposed to be a feature!?
---
I had this happen today, it showed as missing in my power armor HUD so I thought it broke. Got out to look at it and it was equipped and not broken. Got back in and it still was missing in the HUD. but since it showed as equipped in the list I didn't totally lose it.
---
When I was kicked from the server it reappeared when I got back on.
---
And sell plans that we've already learned and found out in the wastes. 
---
I have seen a mutation serum recipe being sold in the Enclave bunker once (but only once) and it was very expensive and havent seem any other since.
---
The only plan I own was from the SBQ.
---
there was a lot of stuff lately where cheaters claimed to have been banned for using mods
---
[
---
gstaff's reply here](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/306176/bgs-is-banning-modders/113?language%5B%5D=en&amp;lang=en-US&amp;page=6) even shows that if anybody feels they were banned in error for using mods that they can appeal on those grounds
---
although I'm positive I read something today that was clearer than that, I can't find it at the moment
---
Oops I forgot to mention that! They're available for all PA except excavator and raider, I believe.
---
Having a similar problem, none of my friends I usually play with wanna buy the game due to the hate it’s been getting
---
Underwhelming and he does seem to be slow  firing and doesn't seem to do a lot of damage.
---
its mostly used for building and repairing xo1 and excavator power armor 
---
It's used to build excavator power armor, dunno aboot anything else buddeh.
---
That's because it's not John Denver's original recording. It's a cover produced specifically for the game.
---
All the other tracks are there original versions, most originating from the 40's and 50's, hence the poorer sound quality.
---
Maybe after I log back on it’ll fix the issue. It still sucks because it actually took my XO 1 leg
---
They could open a new server cluster for a non duped game.  They won't but they could, then you could pick the server cluster you want 
---
i was really hoping for a Big reference
---
It doesn’t mean that at all...?
---
Everyone loves the super sledge, but I have a Grognak axe that's lighter and stronger than any sledge I've seen so far

I got a herbivore serum recipe from a SBQ and am super excited to use it, I am happy to give you one for free.
---
I have a Carnivore Mutation so this is the most useless thing to me ever.

On PC- Rocky4221
---
oh my god dude seriously just stop
---
One time when this happened, I was still able to kill them by tossing mines where the marker for the enemies was.
---
Got plans for the deep pocketed combat armor chest from an event in cranberry bog. 
---
Pretty sure it was Census Violence, but it coulda been one of the brotherhood ones (Surface to Air or Distant Thunder).
---
&gt;I've been playing it since the BETA, like a lot of us and can't even count how many times a game-breaking experience has happened, but I'm not going anywhere.
---
Not everyone has the same tolerance for being crapped on as you.
---
It's also used in making X-01 I think.
---
i use a Zealots golf club 
---
Need more raider stuffs, and hair. Need more hair. Got a dirty combe over thing, only real raider like hair I can find
---
They could ban or wipe the inventory of anyone with 10,000+ nuka colas.... You can guarantee if they have more then 1000 nuka colas that those nuka colas were duped.
---
Thanks for the update
---
Yea check your aid it probably spoiled 
---
Yeah the path I followed him on isn't marked on this at all. Super weird. 
---
Whitesprings have vendors. Sell those bad boys and male a mean pile a caps. :)
---
easy to fix the pvp. they just need disable all legenadary armor and wepon effects durring pvp paralell with disabled mutations.
---
This comment made me laugh so hard.
---
“I haven’t died since beta”
---
Lol
---
Yup, plans, unneeded scrap, ammo basically whatever they need. Since I'm near Flatwood if I see a really low level I offer to make them some basic armor or weapons.  Some are good and decline. Others may ask for a bit of food or to simply use my radscrubber.
---
I giggle every time it's my loading screen.
---
This is absolutely correct. No normal non-duping player would ever have more than 3-4 of the same three star legendary weapon. It's just not possible with a regular play through, and it would make no sense to spends the caps on it. A simple query that pulls the usernames of everyone with more than 10 of whatever three star weapon would reveal the dupers immediately. Somebody please point out why this wouldn't work?
---
nice but today the servers alomst empty.. u missed the rush hours when u get scorched queen kills in eveny 5minute.. now u can farm whitesprings for hurs without met anyone.
---
Yea, "one hell of a community" is a super exaggeration. It only has 1.8k unique dl's
---
It's cuz lv doesn't matter in pvp
---
White knight makes you never need it again basically 
---
Did you end up unlocking or finding dense? I have scrapped so many arms the last few days but had no luck.
---
&gt;Often cheaper to make new armor than repair the old stuff.
---
why anybody wear non legendry armor????
---
Ohhhhhh.... we're in an \*alien\* simulation.
---
Yeah i like completeing challenges but i dont feel obligated.
---
Rose could play some tunes. 
---
Your special status is unchanged, yet what will get worse is the effects on the description of intelligence. Worsened condition and durability of items that you craft, and the return you get from scrapping.
---
Gosh that explains why I keep not having any good mods
---
I had two dudes that killed me went back for revenge died again so 3rd time I took it slow and took them out one at a time grabbed the junk scrapped it FT to a train station and put it in the stash...
---
But you do realize that you don't HAVE to keep going back until you're broke yeah?
---
Yep...it just seems odd that fissures would close up...that shit is intentional
---
That's how it works in real life. If I buy a stolen car, and the police ask for it, I don't get to have a car anymore. Tough luck.
---
The issue with the plasma gun (normal) is this:

Ballistic weapon: pull trigger, projectile instantly hits target. Aim slightly off? Observe impact location and adjust while firing.
---
Plasma: pull trigger, projectile spews a cloud of green gas in your face, then goes out and makes a sandwich, stops by the bank, picks up some groceries, and eventually makes its way to where the target was half an hour ago. Aim slightly off? Too bad sucker, here have some more green gas in your face to obscure your view while I troll you further by making the projectiles occasionally fail to appear at all.
---
*not that i'm bitter*
---
Well if you think about it, exploits that are in games I kind of just like bugs and bugs and games are meant to be there dude the sexiest fuck
---
I agree that 76/BGS and NMS are totally incomparable, this was more of a statement on certain individuals rather than the larger company / game as a whole and any negative impact that they may cause with impunity. Also I do not have any hard sources for BGS salary other than personal accounts, but there are websites such as glassdoor / indeed if thats worth anything
---
They can't ban people for something that is able to be done in game. The only way they could ban someone with out a fitting law suit, is if you use a this party item to hack weapons and create then from thin air. 
---
Sounds like you could use the Wasteland Whisperer perk ;)
---
Use this perk to pacify them and they totally ignore you for a while. This means you can loot around where they are, take some photos or have a conversation with them (they dont say much, lol) without fighting with them.
---
A lot of people dont like this perk but I love it as sometimes I just want to walk from point a to b without fighting every single thing on the map. Otherwise you can pacify them all then just take on one at a time and really take your time in between fighting each one sonyou can pick weapons or use some aid etc.
---
Useful for solo players when you get swarmed by a large group of high level super mutants and a deathclaw all at the same time...

Even when i did cripple one, it took 3-4 thrusters damaged to stop flying. If i didn't have a bunch of rifle ammo i woulda run outta ammo too

Stash on XB1 crashed 3 times in 10 mins for me

I one hit them

I used in it in the beginning, hoping to be as good as previous fallout games. But he isn't... Although i had it maxed, he popped out very often.. But as someone said, typically as i put last shot in mob. But there were times when he would appear if i was sniping, then hold aggro and shoot. Which was nice if mob was higher lvl then me.. But after awhile i have up on that perk, to use something more valuable at higher lvl
---
One downside to Grognak Axe is that it doesn’t seem to work with certain perk card such as Luck of the Draw and the over-repair one
---
Be funny and smell nice helps too. 
---
I only have initiate but there was someone selling a “T-60 BOS Standard Paint”.  Sadly I’m poor and couldn’t get it, but on asking they said they either got it from technical data OR treasure maps.  Anyone else know if the other rewards are possible with maps?  I’m 100+ in and only getting Initiate.

Shoot the vertibirds down to low Hp -&gt; wait til the cargoBOT is flying close to the vertibirds -&gt; pop the last bit of Hp off so the vertibirds explode -&gt; cargobots rotors are broken and it won't move any more. 
---
You're welcome.
---
 Ps: I have a TSE and this is still easier to pull off 
---
Ahh I've been avoiding cranberry for a while
---
You mean cargobot I assume, unless you named it Bob in homage to the Bobiverse in which case I totally approve.
---
The first couple of times I had to watch the direction it was going and try to fast travel ahead of it.  Sometimes it was too high, sometimes not.  It won't always be too high you just have to catch it in the mood to socialize with you.  Then get a couple of shots on the engines, they are weak and with damaged engines it'll come to a stop and hover fairly low, easy pickins.  I find it can take several minutes of careful shooting to get hits on the engines because it ducks and weaves, but it's not \*that\* difficult to do.  Now I make it a priority to shoot down any of these that I see nice and low, they're not reserved for the person who started the quest, if you catch it quicker than them, good for you.
---
Yeah 
---
I just don't think you should lose caps for PvP
---
I had to thought about that point specially, but that would be a great reason and I love it, I hope one is eventually or maybe a small cast of robots running the show that talks about in game events.
---
He doesnt one shot things anymore and a lot of times he doesnt shoot at all. He's still useful because takes your enemy's attention off you for a few seconds tho.
---
I knew about that one, it slipped my mind. I thought there was one in fallout 3, NV, or 4 that I've missed. Thanks for the reminder about the classics
---
I do this frequently... As i move around farming, i always have my mic on and ask players if they are in need of things, or i simply drop what i don't want and tell them take what they need. 
---
My first experience was similar, yet quite different:
---
*Mouses over dilapidated van*
---
"Oh cool, a hermit crab, must be behind that van up the road. I hope they're like the mudcrabs from Skyrim, man those guys were such cute lil jerksswwwwwhhhhaaaaaAAAAAAATTHEHELLISTHISSHIT?!"
---
Should note that it seems they explode 5 mins after being downed.  In that time, anyone can grab a keycard from it, even people who didn't shoot it - I \*think\*.
---
In all fairness I had it by level 20 or so, ran powering up Poseidon when I saw it and u receive the plans after 3 times,  if someone else is there takes 10 minutes to do.  But because I know some dont know it's that easy I make them for most anyone I run across, you can build in peoples camps if your on their team btw.
---
Try being a melee only user. I got this quest a few days ago and don't even want to finish it. I hate being shoehorned into a play style. 
---
Now I have to find a half decent gun and start saving up ammo. 
---
I've had people msg via psn, which i gladly helped. But a fan of blank invites. But i agree, a feature like this would be helpful

---
For me I'm constantly encumbered, despite being under weight 227/230. No idea why or how to fix.
---
Thanks.  Was wondering if I was getting myself into trouble by getting all the mutations. 
---
The engine was never made to handle multiplayer and thus they have no tools. They added multiplayer now in a hasty way, that doesn't work. They bend it, till it break. They should have developed it in a much more careful way and also create tools to observe and manage their servers. Dupes should have been expected. They are the most common issues in multiplayer games.
---
They need to fix the issues and then do a reset of the whole game, otherwise it's utterly broken. There are so many items on the servers, that even the server suffer. And i think, there is much more to come. Once they fixed the issue after months, players will find a new way to exploit.
---
Play as supermutant would be great!
---
But r/fallout told me Bethesda won't update this game anymore.
---
Nah mutations are great especially with class freak 
---
They're trying to get our recipe for concentrated dark matter! Take off all your clothes!
---
Big facts
---
Well lvl dosnt really matter after 50 in general .
---
Two people I play with found the blueprint for the wetsuit randomly around watoga. One in a train car another in the back of the truck. It’s sucks it’s an under armor cause it looks really cool.
---
You need to get a terminal and you can set “activate on anything” 
---
If you are on pc, I have both the wetsuit and helmet 
---
They don't need to succeed, they just need to generate enough bad PR that Bethesda is willing to settle. As long as they don't contact a mod author, they have plausible deniability for such claims.
---
Mind you, I'd love for them to do so. I'd greatly prefer reduced bugs. But I'm not a corporate entity with shareholders, so I'm not beholden to do things like release a game six months too early.
---
I was referring to quality, not quantity
---
and either way 1800 people is far better than the 0 we can currently chat in text with
---
Well he just keeled over and died while i was in his menu.  I tried.
---
In the spirit of PSAs, I found that sometimes the vertibirds will hover so close to you that you can take them down with a shotgun, meaning that the explosion turns you into kitty litter.  They do go off with a bang those vertibirds!
---
There is actually a mod on nexus that fixes this (and many other fixes too)
---
But I don’t want to get banned for downloading mods that give me player advantages over other players... like an actual working compass 
---
Get a friend to do it for you and he can get a card from it too
---
Looks great!
---
In that case they could of made it more like an MMO with a class system and ascensions. Light Gunner - Heavy Gunner. Tree Puncher - Sledge Swinger 
---
ah console i'm afraid, ty though!
---
You can never have too many hats, gloves and ammo clips
---
Isn’t it a lvl 25 weapon?
---
agreed but i'm in power armor 90% of the time so i'll mostly see it during escape plan "oh fuck that's a myrelurk queen and i have 10% on a core + cnd"
---
I am not sure if you understood my point. I'm not claiming that you're going to get banned or have your account reverted or some other thing. I am merely advocating being a good consumer. 
---
Being a good consumer means inspecting before you buy. If they have 1000 NCQ's in a vending machine, there is no reasonable way they did it through legitimate means. So don't buy from that person. Unlike in real life, where people may have no choice but to shop at Walmart for the cheaper prices, this is a game, and nothing is forcing you from doing your best to not reward some wanker breaking the economy.
---
I think the gun unlocks at 25. like power armor you can't craft something your too low to equip. If thats not the case then make sure you actually have learned the plan, not just bought it. Requires level 3 perk for weapon making as well. 
---
That description is pretty accurate. There is an open,wooden coffin jutting out from a cliff and inside it is the holotape. The small cliff/ledge/ridge is behind some houses iirc
---
You can get the Nuka Cola paint job in Game search for a toturial but it's a long journey.
---
Thanks.  Was really wanting to posting images on here - thought I'd start there.  Good to see I apparently did it right. XD
---
I just imagine being reskinned as a glowing one for having them all. I probably deserve that for how I've irradiated myself.
---
I've killed many a good man over a fancy hat. I look good tho... damn good.
---
For the record. Found both on mirelurk queens 
---
Too little, too late, but the description said it was 5 undercorated and 4 decorated.
---
I’m so sorry, but I’m still having trouble finding this location.  Is it near the house with the duchess safe or another location?  
---
Thanks know of any others?
---
Yeah, it's got slightly better reach/arc by my anecdotal impressions also.  I'd prefer a Grognak's version of what I have now in super sledge, 40% swing +1STR Vampire
---
Cannot upvote this enough. 
---
After the first weeks I had more then 2000 Atoms. So glad, they offered the Blackbird PA skin, since it was no Bild Cola Santa Patriot Teenage-Chamo Hippi Skin. 
---
Now, another some weeks later of playing, here I am again, sitting on more thousand atoms, just by progressing the game and looking forward to some service rifle skin, Chinese armor apparel or bloody Raider PA skin. 
---
Either search the Nuka Cola plant carefully or turn in Technical Data for the Brotherhood of Steel and hope you get lucky.
---
I am on PC, but thank you for the offer!
---
I haven't run into the quest yet but I saw one flying low over some town. The enemies there shot all the vertibirds down, but not the bot. 
---
I'm melee only, so I was running around the town looking for guns and ammo to shoot it down. I had a bunch of random ammo on me, so it sort of worked, but I kept running out. 
---
I finally got its health down to about 1/8 left, ran out of ammo again and went to get more, when another player came in and shot it down super fast while I wasn't paying attention. It was helpful because I couldn't find any more ammo but I was also kinda bummed. 
---
Probably took a solid hour and a half waiting on my AP to refresh so I could use VATS to aim. And I don't have the targeting in VATS either so it was just "yeah shoot the bot". Totally a mess. 
---
I like being melee most of the time, but cargo bots, scorch beasts, and enemies on roofs are really bugging me. I'm probably going to have to have some points in heavy guns or something or I think late game is going to be rough on me.
---
strange things those things inhale.. found my favorite harpoon gun on one of them, some mini nukes on another
---
Head to The Northwest Side of Town, and go behind the wrecked houses like the guide says. Pretty self explanatory.
---
So the barbells and weights in the penitentiary exercise yard. Are they fake and only there so I can trip on something in a firefight, or should I be able to collect them for some sweet sweet materials?
---
Its been awhile, and I cannot fully remember. I can only suggest finding small cliffs and run along them,looking for a jutting out half of a coffin. Its inside the coffin itself.
---
I know I’m being super idiotic.  I went to that direction and still can’t find it.  
---
I’ll go again right now but if anyone has a pic or any other details, I’d appreciate it.
---
I left some ammo and dog food at the corpses by the vault the other day. like 200+ 308 and shotgun (its what I use, so its all I pick up) and 45 or so cans of dog food, as well as all the plans I had on my person at the time. Ran into a dude today if I had any unwanted plans, so I dropped him what i had. Me and my friends of course share stuf with each other, and when I have spare stimpaks I share with them also. So TL:DR, yes I give stuff to randoms and people I know.
---
While the assumption exists that Bethesda will not ban accounts for using QoL mods, there is no guarantee.  Does that meet your safety requirement?  It is a risk.
---
If that works for you, Nexus mods is a very well established site and fully legit for Fallout 4.  So modders are experimenting with client-side 76 mods there, often based on ones from F4.  Lots of rating info to help you feel confident that the mod is useful, and you can see how many other people have evaluated.
---
Even if dupers are to blame, it’s still Bethesda’s fault. I have known about duping for like 3 weeks, I would hope that Bethesda has known longer than me. They should have reacted immediately with a hotfix for the duping glitches because it is literally game breaking. It hasn’t only made the game completely lacklustre because you can get the very best weapon in the game for around 1000 caps from literally anyone but it is also causing game crashes and server disconnects for everyone throughout their play session.
---
I am frustrated by the lack of reaction from Bethesda on the duping. It’s as if they have just said “well Christmas is coming in a week or two, we will just wait it out, have a couple of weeks break for the festivities and take a look when we get back”. Meanwhile, Fallout 76 plummets to the bottom of everyones game piles.
---
I like or at least liked this game a lot but I’m fed up with it now. Bring on Anthem.
---
No, I think this is the only one.
---
Wow you are a dumb slug.  CheatEngine can and is used for messing with single player games, if they didn't attach it to FO76 then they didn't cheat.   Guess what, I bet you have a fancy keyboard or mouse that lets you create macros and assign them to buttons (like most gaming mice and keyboards).  That, per the words in their ELA is hardware used to give an advantage.   Now, should you be banned simply for having it even if you didn't create any macros for the game?     
---
Grow up.  Hundreds of game companies do anti-cheat effectively.   Beth has no idea what they are doing so just shoot for the cheapest, simplest thing.   Oh you, own a crowbar?  Well that can be used to break into a bank... guilty!
---
veggies dont fill your bellie but if you cook them the other effect still work like thirt and buff
---
That would be pretty awesome.
---
Tell me where you live i'll come and destroy it all
---
Thx, the trailer showed flame paint job but haven’t been able to find it
---
This is interesting actually, 
---
The sites near Prime are still active, but I did managed to get all the way up to an undiscovered site and “find” it without a single Scorched being their let alone an actual Beast. 
---
Also, might not be news but my wife found a “Collapsed” fissure at the bottom of the cliff under top of the world (Woods side, not mire)
---
I’ve been there a few times never seen the gasses  or it before. No map marker either. 
---
Thx
---
Watoga is good about that too.
---
The wrecked building with the hole in the wall directly ahead of you when you fast travel to Harper's Ferry has three levels full of display cases, you can reach the upper levels through a train car leading up just outside the exit. Each of the cases has a chance to spawn the wetsuit or helmet plans, I found the suit plans there a few days ago.
---
I thought it was just me getting disoriented every time I entered that bulky HUD. 
---
I would say there is nothing to do atm, but instead, I'll just go play something else, and wait for content patches.
---
I found a bunch in the cash register once
---
Yeh the Cargobobs has more health than the vertibirds by a marathons length. It makes no sense. If they had the same health things would be more reasonable. Military Attack chopper has less health than a supply drop ship... maybe not the best idea.
---
As far as ur melee build, I can say that you’ll probably want to keep at least 1 fun for ranges enemies on u at all times, but if u get the Marsupial perk enemies on rooftops shouldn’t be that tough. I run a shotgun build and with marsupial I can almost always jump to enemy high ground positions.
---
We ran out of nukes to launch sorry.
---
As a fellow melee only I'm probably going to go with big guns, there are enough perks for them in strength that I feel like I could keep the cards handy and switch them out as needed. 
---
I shot down a lvl 50 scorch beast by myself with a Gatling laser at level 35 or so. No perks for guns at all in my build, not even targeting body parts in VATS. But I did use 5 fusion cores as well as smacking it with my sledgehammer every time it landed.
---
My new plasma Gatling has been less effective. It broke three times trying to kill one scorchbeast. 
---
I think Gatling laser is going to be the way to go for me.
---
Well none of that is showing up in my reddit feed and googling it didn’t bring up anything. It’s probably just me. 
---
problem with that is you'd have most everyone playing it solo on their own private server. would cost them way more money in hardware to run that many virtual machines, now they only need a server for every 20-24 or so people, can you imagine how many problems they would have with 20 times as many servers? Maybe if your on PC and they made it so you could host the server that would be fine, but I don't know how that would work on console.
---
I wish I had your faith lol
---
They also say:  
---
\&gt;  You agree not to use any hardware or software or any other method of support that is not authorized by ZeniMax or that may in any way influence or advantage Your playing abilities, 
---
That 'hardware' that 'may' be able to give you an advantage, includes your fancy gaming mouse or keyboard that can have macros programmed.   Even if you don't use it that way in their game, you are guilty and should be banned.     Come on, hold them to the anti-cheating standards of the industry, tons of companies do this well without resorting to such cheap tactics as "if you have program X installed, you are guilty"
---
Other players no, but it can still hit player built structures and give you a bounty.
---
That would be great 
---
He appears fairly often and isn't much help. Really, really early it's great to have a distraction so you can reload or find a better vantage, but mostly he just walks around the enemy for a few seconds before vanishing.
---
An that is the point.   They are cheap and lazy.
---
I love killing nobs like you Need them caps.

 "Miguel used to be laid back, but these days he's just.. intense. It never gets old! Unlike Miguels decomposing remains."

Put some points into strength and get hold of a decent melee weapon (one of the corpses at the front of Vault 76 has a machete). With guns I find it hard to target fast-moving enemies in VATs when they get too close, but melee VATs works really well. An easy way of dispatching low level enemies.
---
Total coward here… I built my Excavator Armor in the safety of the crafting paradise in the retail shops area at Whitesprings Resort, with all valuable ingredients, like Black Titanium, in my stash.
---
I got my handmade plans at watoga at 16. Haven't seen it since. I'm only 40, but I went from 16-20 in a day so never went back to watoga when its supposed to be available to buy except for the one time I bought it. 
---
Yeah, somebody already tried that tonight.  Had to shoot the poor feller in the back of the head.  Reminded me of that time with ol' yeller :_(
---
Let us but songs to add.
---
On Xbox we have looking for group, it works really well
---
Yeah I think I'm just going to keep the strength theme going and go for heavy guns. I've been carrying a plasma Gatling around but I'll also explore some others. Maybe missile launchers. I don't know.
---
Starched genes is coming up for sure. I just hit level 40 today so I'm not sure if I'm there yet 
---
I’d love to bro, but I’m PS4. Hijacking your thread for any PS4 players who need to do this send me a message :)

any idea what the trade price goes for the blueprints on the wet/tac? i do have a couple of the actual armor blueprints i was thinking of bartering with 
---
Telephones don't give screws.
---
If u already have large generator it only takes 1 or 2 runs to get it btw, it goes in order based on what u have.  Plans for under armor resistance appear to work that way as well, bought each next level as I got the previous.
---
How do I get that
---
I was given the same advice a few weeks ago and it has been amazing
---
I like all of these except for the previously mentioned 3. Have an upvote.
---
I’d go for a Gatling gun if u want a heavy weapon. The ammo is easy to find as most scorched and super mutants carry it (its regular assault rifle ammo.), and you get better dmg per bullet than a minigun and better accuracy than a milled launcher and u don’t have to carry around the super heavy ammo of the launchers and Gatling Laser/plasma.
---
Had the same issue until about lvl70 when I switched to a heavy weapons build. They started to melt super fast. No TSE weapons either. 
---
Because*
---
So the Animal Friend perk and the Wateland Whisperer perk will only pacifiy enemies for a limited amount of time.
---
How successful you can pacify something depends on what level perk card you have (1-3), the thing you pacify has to be a lower level then you and Animal friends only works on animals (dogs, mega sloths, bears) and Wasteland whisperer works on other enemies (scotched, super mutants, ghouls etc). Some creatures actually work with both like Mirlurks and Deathclaws.
---
So taming creatures is different, in addition to getting the 'Pacify' option when you aim at a creature (sometimes you have two options if you have both wasteland whisperer and animal friend perks attached) you will also get a Tame option that will ask you if you want to add the creature to your camp.
---
The tame option will only appear with creature that is at least half of your level and they need to be spawned by themselves (this is the hard bit). It does not work of they spawn in a group or part of mission or a regular spawn area, they need to be randomly wandering by themselves.
---
The best place I have found to do this is on the right hand side of the map, mostly the top right part near the power plant or Abbeys bunker. It doesn't come up a lot by I have had a Mega Sloth pet and a toad (one was obviously more useful then the other).
---
It is some pretty hard requirments to find the right creature so just keep trying and check any creature you see wandering around.
---
Also, to Tame a deathclaw you need both Animal Friend and Wastland Whisperer equipped. 
---
Vampiric is super nice because it will heal during combat.
---
I am guessing that a faster vampire will heal more frequently.
---
Over-repair is extremely helpful for all melee weapons i have tried.
---

I'm not even level 100 yet- about level 60 actually- and I'm feeling this way, but honestly my biggest complaint is about other players- specifically how higher level players treat nuke zones. I've been playing solo the entire time and just recently finally was able to launch my first nuke (after many tries and failures to get the keycard, and several deaths trying to get through the silo facility). I got to the edge of the nuke zone, watched the blast, ran in, excited to explore my first nuke zone... and found bodies where about ten higher leveled characters (judging by the number of people I saw in the distance and on the map) apparently ran in and killed everything before I could get to it. I ended up with a bunch of unstable flux from the flora, but only one hardened mass from a single Scorched that they missed, and nothing else, which means the flux was next to useless, and I didn't get any of the legendary items that you can supposedly get by fighting things in nuke zones. But mostly I just wanted to explore and fight through the nuke zone myself, given that I'd launched the nuke myself.
---
No idea, you could check some of the sales subreddits for a price range. I suppose it depends on how much someone wants to look like symbiote-era Spiderman.

Where are the skins from the trailer?

You need to check Notes in you inventory, the plans will be there.

I thought they where mothman cultists. nope these ones where his. 
---
Can you explain to me how the gatling laser is fine? I am genuinely curious as i like the idea of using fusion cores as ammo. I tried it and with the charging barrel it shoots harder but way slower and it only deals a tiny amount of damage compared to how slowly it fires. Its only removes like 3mm of the mobs' health. Without charging barrel it shoots really fast and that way you can do some damage, but i burnt through 24 fusion cores in less than an hour...
---
Met a level 120 grinding whitespirings with a level 32 while passing through. Every time the 120 saw me they shot at me until I went away. Guess they were power leveling the other character and didn't want to "lose" xp to me. I got tired of it and just went away, so I guess they got what they wanted? I wasn't in any danger since I didn't retaliate, but it was annoying. Guess that comes with the territory though.
---
I’m always impressed with the houses that has multiple walls not in a solid shape.  Mine is just a basic square lol

Which workshop?
---
They didn't: They're making things up.
---
In FO4 kept getting beaten in the Kellogg showdown and only managed to beat him after a half a dozen tries (I was really low level, honest). The thing is, I used to get a 'Settlement is under Attack' message during these fights, and half the time the settlement managed to defend itself, the other half it failed. In other examples, some of my settlements always defended themselves. I think it was a chance mechanic based on overall firepower.

What is the problem, you build your camp near water, put down your purifiers in the water and pop a rad-x, collect water from the same waterspot directly to inventory and boil it, with that boiled water you make juices or drink it directly.
---
So apparently herd mentality or egg head combined with class freak makes DR perks like barbarian or evasive bug out and do nothing.
---
If you played fallout for choices, romances and story missions, it may not be for you.
---
If you played it for roaming and discovering weird places with one-off small stories, fo76 delivers. The discovered stories ate tapes and mr. handy npcs, not people, but there are great ones in there. This part feels like Fallout, and you are still basically a lone wanderer in the wasteland.

All the hate is pretty over exaggerated and uncalled for imo. I've easily put 300 hours into this game and it's still fun to me.

Oof I always said To the town of Our Free-er

Literally my dream for this game to be the ability for a player to host his/her own radio station. But... I know that's never gonna happen

Yeah there are issues but it's not completely unplayable or anything. There are many many threads about it all so feel free to look around in here.

It was an issue with how they implemented a third party physics engine, not the core engine itself.

LOLOLOLOL. Ok, so I'm sitting here, waiting to defend Wade Airport. I have 7 other workshops and I haven't looted them in a bit. I'm slow leveling off them while exploring since nukes are down. Out of the corner of my eye, I read this comment,... Right as I finish I go to access my pip boy...

DISCONNECTED FROM SERVER

LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL

If you don't know how the Public Workshops operate, this video might help explain them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLhVDCEVc8o
---
Well dialogue conversation is easy as there is none (other than your mic with other players).  There is a level cap for special points at 50 but afterwards you still get cards or you can respec one point of SPECIAL.  PvP is broken.  There are some great writing moments in the game (seen through holotapes, terminals, letters in world, and environmental story telling.  This is coupled with server and client stability issues.  A lot of these issues are being caused by other players duping.  
---
When “it just works” it is a very fun game either solo or teaming up.  When it shows it is a normal BSG game, it can be pretty frustrating.
---
Not on xbox so results may vary but some people said clearing out holotapes and notes helped
---
Could you have had something depressing your mutation like rad x? I think that does it. 
---
I’ve only noticed it cause I run with the Healing Factor mutation and it stops working when I use certain chems
---
That's why I popped in lol. Checking how the game really is, not just by Youtube hate videos about it. Considering on giving it a shot, it's cheap enough now.
---
It’s pylon v-13.
---
Project vault 13 was the f.o.o.l. Code name for interplay, at some point. I can’t really tell if it’s a send up or an homage.
---
Shotguns, heavy weapons and melee perk cards are all in Strength... how on earth can you be good at all 3 of them at the same time? Plus not get over-encumbered since most of the weight perk cards are in Strength too..
---
FOUND IT!  
---
Thank you all 🥳
---
290hours is verry worth, but now if i dont do main boss runs with group (it is bugged now) I just jump around muted kangaroo mad man with knife, stabing everything I come across. 
---
For now there is not real endgame, but they have cool plans to this year. So yeah, this game rocks!
---
At 35 with excavator armor and a supersledge perked into Guns I could still take 3-4 level 60's in melee pretty easily. Now I'm 40 and they are even easier and I have a better melee weapon, still not specced into melee but it doesn't matter if your power armor is good enough. Super Mutants are probably my favorite thing in this game to fight, and have been since way before I was good at killing them. 
---
You cant have instigating and bloodied on the same weapon. They're both prefix effects.
---
Just like in Fallout 4, which takes me the hope that they fix it. 
---
But yesterday, after 2 months of playing I noticed, that without wearing a PA, the quest markets in compass even gives you elevation hints. Is a quest above you, it marks with an arrow above.... and now guess what, NOT ON PA COMPASS!
---
No they cant exist
---
TSE + Mod for Accuracy + Skeet Shooter = "Almost sniper." With my current setup on a level 15 character, using a pump action and skeet shooter 3, I can nail targets with at least a couple direct hits so long as they're within the actual range of the shotgun. In the case of TSE, if they even get close you get the explosive damage. So not a glitch, just another example of how broken TSE Shotguns are.
---
Okay, but why have that as cosmetic stuff when it can be added for free as actually useful items in the game later when new content drops?
---
People would riot if these formerly amazing outfits were made into Atom Shop cosmetics.
---
2x repair durability is worth it on all items, no doubt.  Something everyone should have once they're past 50 and taking QoL cards.  Vampiric saves a ton of chems and I give most of my stimpacks to teammates.  With Makeshift Warrior x5 I only repair that thing once every 3 nukes/queens.
---
I'll come shoot them for you.
---
He had it coming 
---
Where do you look for the mod?
---
I like it. It scratches my itch for wandering and exploring a post-apocalyptic wasteland, I'm almost level 60 and approaching the end of the main questline but there's still a ton of places I haven't been and small mysteries to investigate.
---
My concern is people having concerns and ideas about something that isnt out yet.
---
Let wait to see what Bethesda has to offer and afterwards, discuss what we like and dislike instead of making shit up before we have a god damn clue as to how it works etc.
---
You know what else makes for giggle-worthy loading screens?
---
Using Photo Mode to take a picture every time you find a glitch. I have pictures with a floating rock, a non-hostile Super Mutant in only his underwear, a ghoul who remained standing after I killed him *but has an empty hole where his head used to be*, a swarm of Cargobots with no Vertibot escorts circling across the bridge from Point Pleasant, et cetera.
---
Yes, there is the BoS Initiate Power Armor paint, you get it from delivering technical data to Camp Venture, takes a while though or you can just get lucky.
---
On closer inspection... I think it is jsut sleeping. Going to head down there to hit it with a sword later. 
---
I'd settle for more concise loot tables. Shotguns and Melee from Mole Miners. Rifles and pistols from Scorched. Heavy and melee from supermutants. And so on.
---
definitely maybe
---
Its bs. They could ban people who have negative numbers on carry weight or those who have litterally ten of thousands of lb in inventory. If they do not have tools for checking  player character they should make it for sake of economy  in this game.
---
There are heads on the walls of that cave.  
---
That same head is present in the estate of one of the richest mining families in the region.  
---
COINCIDENCE!?
---
They didn’t have major development dollars set aside for post launch on these projects, due to how they were set up as a business. Everything can be fixed. You just need to throw developer and tester time at it. 
---
Fallout 76, by contrast, is intended to live in development for a long time, and there’s far more chance they’ll address nagging issues on this title. 
---
I know there is usually one behind the BoS vendor building. Where does the other tend to pop up?
---
Whew, I bet that's a broken weapon right there :)
---
Seems like they do some maintenance, don't worry about it. You can join in a bit later. 
---
Yes! I found the plans for the marine helmet at Sunday Brothers Cabin, just west of Harper’s Ferry. The shed outside where there’s a generator and some workbenches, on top of the barrels, is a spawn point for all marine armor plans, actually. I’ve picked up the helmet and the torso there. 
---
I have lost a few items to the bag glitch. I now drop one item I don't mind losing then transfer into the bag if it appears.
---
It'd be cool if Huntingdon and Wheeling were added. Maybe some parts of Maryland and Pennsyltucky. 
---
I'm more interested in how often he shows up to revive you if you have that one equipped. For when I kill myself with my explosive weapon again:)
---
I feel new content will be modular armour like leather, metal, etc so things like riot armor won't really fit into that, if they gave it out as a single stat item people would miss out on multiple legendary effects and more than likely the resistances would be outclassed by other items.
---
I've killed several and I'm not to 40 yet. I set up a camp whenever I encounter one and fill it full of nothing but turrets. Then I spend my time running around repairing them. It's a materials crunch more than anything. And have plenty of stimpacks! Good luck!
---
It kinda reminds me of [Snake Eyes](https://www.google.com/search?q=original+snake+eyes+uniform&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari#imgrc=zPiCd5pjCkvfpM:)
---
oh that could be silo hotfix
---
TSE is overrated. 
---
The TS massively gimps hip fire accuracy and recoil. 
---
The E is not proximity safe, in a game where over half the bad things rush at you in mobs and go point blank. 
---
It’s an easy spray and pray weapon for people who don’t know how to put a proper build together. 
---
You don't seem to realize how much hate most of the players have for this.
---
No shit Sherlock, not an answer to any of the questions asked.
---
I never tune in radio stations unless they're guiding me to an end point. I enjoy the subtle atmosphere of a priorly humane occupied cell overwhelmed with communists.
---
like the Diablo 3 auction house before they banned it.
---
If he had pacifist on and became wanted for something stupid I could get it being upset but man... guy needs to chill out.
---
Sometimes, if I'm carrying a fuck ton of ammo. Travel to the nearest somewhat low level, and throw a few pounds worth of ammo, and maybe a weapon I don't use outside their door
---
I sing along to like every song on Appalachia radio
---
They don't trigger the turrets until they start claiming.  So if none of the turrets can see the workbench, then they are safe in claiming it.  Also turrets will attack any wanted players I think.
---
Holy shit you had me in tears.
---
Is that an area based thing? My friend from Maine can connect just fine, but no luck for me in the St. Louis area.
---
The easiest way to finish that mission is to spend a couple hours in nuke sites, killing legendary glowing ones here and there... if you want to kill scorch beasts like I did, I won’t stop you, but you need thousands and thousands of rounds.
---
true, getting warframe riven mod flashes from this haha
---
Yes you can. I just collected some and completed the "An Organic Solution" quest the other day. 
---
What’s your username? And I appreciate this so much!
---
&gt; For quest-obtainable all-parts plans: Excavator and X-01 prototype
---
Which quest gets you X-01 plans? I haven't found any such plans or any quest that seems related to them, and I thought I'd done all the quests I could aside from events/dailies that I haven't gotten to yet.
---
It is better to let emotions out, way of relax. Do not tell me, you are calm all the time. (yeah he is extra crazy, is it bad?)
---
I feel like they tried to nuke whitesprings on every server simultaneously and broke it.. now they're like hahaha what event? 👀
---
Good for you. Sounds like your 20 years include about 0 years on lean projects. 
---
Lean = ship as early as people will be prepared to use it (which they have)  and prioritize based on feedback. 
---
Whatever your opinions on not-waterfall, this is a not-watetfall project. Stop making waterfall assumptions, they’re bunk. 
---
I think the main issue is that server disconnects happen due to the server crashing. Meaning, there is no longer a world instance for you to connect to. 
---
Now, a reconnection feature would be nice for those instances where it actually was your connection going out (or something else in between). Bu think anout it, you and everyone else has this problem, so it’s pretty unlikely it’s anything but an issue with server crashes.
---
You can get Jetpack (and all mods) for every PA. Some are just more rare but I have almost all for all as a mod, or as a plan or at least I saw every one once at a vendor. Some are very difficult to recognize like Raider, Excavator abs Ultracite has the same name, so you have to look for the ingredients. 
---
Saying this, I wonder why you advice x-01 for Jetpack? Easier to get maybe?
---
Actually, the first jetpack I came across east he T-45 jetpack plan. 
---
X-01 prototype != x01
---
I found today that you occasionally get the option to buy the mutation plans from the same vendor that sells the serum, they're 19800 caps tho
---
if they had to shut the game down they know they would need to compensate players with atoms ad that's why they wont shut the servers down.
---
Dailies are not daily.  And when one does trigger for you, it is limited to that server, so getting dropped blows it.  :(
---
might be a longshot, but how about a dedicated RP server?
---
That was an awesome video imo. Entertained
---
You on Xbox one could have been me.
---
No PC
---
No, it is just a bug. They will fix it tomorrow they said.
---
BTW, re jack of all trades outfit
---
Arms excavator yellow 
---
Torso and legs in SR-71 black. 
---
Looks rad
---
Right.  You don't have to carry the stuff on you to craft from any crafting station.  It all pulls from your stash (and inventory)  as you need, no matter if there is a stash nearby.  No reason to risk all those materials except the ones you're gathering in the field.
---
Cool!
---
There is a camp outside of watoga near a fissure site, the camp has a antiair turret you can repair
---
BuT WhY?
---
They post every day on [https://twitter.com/fallout](https://twitter.com/fallout)
---
They released an update here too [https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019)
---
You're just weren't looking, but like to complain about stuff.
---
Then not me, but someone did something really similar and I happened to be in Charleston at time as well.
---
Uhh..Bethesda would never settle that case. The modder would lose and have to cover Bethesda's court costs. PR be damned. Nobody worth a damn would think Bethesda was in the wrong for improving the performance of their game. That's what they are literally paid to do.
---
Hey I just got that too!
---
My buddy found one as well.
---
Just because that’s what I got. Bad information on my side. I’ll remove that bit from the OP. 
---
Duper’s were mostly guys who wanted a Two shot explosive but had some guy say they don’t have enough money. I’ve met many of them in game and that’s what they tell me. Often enough these guys are out there standing outside the vault helping new players out. 
---
So question is, are they really as bad ? Or are we making them villains out of envy.
---
If you send me a team invite and I can't see you in the immediate area, I'm not going to accept it, I'm just going to be bewildered because why would you add me off a list of names? That's happened several times. No one was in the area.
---
Whenever I have tried to accept an invite, there's no invitation in the social thing? I'm not sure what to do.
---
fortnite is stupidly succesful, of course they will try to copy the mood. We will get funny and light stuff in the atomic shop
---
"stop complaining you bought a game worth $20 for $60, it's your fault Bethesda lied to you!"
---
Whacky man
---
Talk about a terrible fking bug.
---
Well, i think level 40 is early. But it really depends on your build. I find master shotgunner and enforcer both maxed, extremely useful when fighting scorchbeasts, because the enforcer card stuns enemies and scorchbeasts have a tough time getting off the ground.
---
However you need them to get to the ground and for that, a couple of pounts invested in rifleman are also useful to propel sniper rifles and black powder rifles damage. 
---
There's also a melee weapon that helps fighting scorchbeasts in the ground which is the sledgr All Rise, that you get from Mayor for a Day quest at Watoga.
---
Apart from that i really think you should first consider taking down the scorchbeast near Whitespring. Spawn the beast, take a couple of shots with vats and run for the entrance for some robot support. Make sure you do it when theres a sentry bot there. This will help you get an idea what you're up against. 
---
Why would you carry the materials on you? Afaik you can craft it with all the mats in your stash?
---
People are just sick of the direction the game industry is going.   Why did FO76 get a big brunt of it?   Because we expected better of them.    I remember once when I was in middle school I got in trouble for something and I asked the VP of the school why I got in trouble and other kids didn't.   He said "Because I expect better of you, because I know you can be better."    Kinda shitty of him not to believe in the other kids but I think it is an ok metaphore.   I for one, didn't expect this from them, I expected more from them than from EA and it hurts when those you love let you down.
---
FO4 was my first Fallout in the series, but unlike you, I'm pretty glad that I played that one and finally knew what Fallout is really about. Someone enjoys the story and choices, others may have fun with the gameplay itself, but for me there is only something special about this series you can't find the same in any other titles - a strong hook that keeps you exploring the world, go here and there, follow a path or lead to something even more intriguing. 
---
So with my 50 hrs in 76, I'd say the game is still fun to explore, tons of stuff I want to know about. For example, I'm still following the Overseer's journey, even though everything is being told via holotapes (I'm becoming more patient with this way of narration and I don't know why). Reading nearly everything and try to figure out who is who is pretty much the fun in such an exploration, but I have unexpectedly enjoyed it. And for now, I have only put my step on half of the huge Appalachia land. 
---
My advice: get it on discount, take your time and don't rush it, enjoy the feeling of know the unknow, figure out your own style of being a wasteland wanderer, and I hope you could find what that special part is in FO76. 
---
Get bored of doing the same menial tasks for no real reward? That sounds like anyone who isn't a submissive thrall.
---
Really? Lol what is going on!
---
So is it a bug or a feature? or both? 
---
Shitpost
---
Or just add a boiler that produces boiled water instead of all the purifiers.
---
You are better off joining weight watchers anonymous, this game is no fun. Launched many nukes and for the most part it's a balancing act. Keep enough weapons and ammunition and aid so you can collect enough junk to make what you think you want and craft a new item before that other stuff expires. Talk about a lesson in futility.Dangggg
---
Makes zero sense. And is not enjoyable. Fix please.   
---
The Power Armor HUD also doesn't translate, Bethesda neglected a lot of small things in PA. Explosive vents being useless is one I really hate.
---
Exactly my point. 
---
Ya know, I know the answer but I don't really feel like being nice to you after this shitty response to someone just trying to help.
---
I wish Rose played actual music.
---
Not to mention : 
---
4 different perk cards for diseases mitigation
---
6 for radiation
---
10 for eating/drinking
---
This is simply placeholders and could be easily be cut by half. The problem by spreading these perks efficiency too sin is that it creats a "best in slot" kind of resoning that leads to cookie cutting "builds" like in so many online games.
---
Yeah, I just run with boiled water and whatever I can craft with it. West VA is bleeding rad-away out the wah-zoo.
---
Are you trying to kill them without power armor? That's really painful without White Knight and preferably the Dense or Padded torso mods. Stock power armor takes far less damage from the sonic blast. Also don't fight them by choice unless you have good cover to use.
---
I don't know if you're using VATS or not. With VATS you use Concentrated Fire to target the wings. Otherwise you just hit the thing and hope. The Tormentor perk may or may not help. Make sure the scorchbeast actually has space to land. 
---
A hunting rifle with a perforating magazine is ok for popping at aerial scorchbeasts, but you'll need some sort of dpm weapon for when they lands. Assault or combat rifle is fine if you're not into melee. Spam shots into its head and you should see the hp bar drop at a decent rate.
---
Personally I'd avoid fighting them at level 40. It's just about workable but the rewards are nowhere near worth the ammo and repair costs.
---
I love All Rise and Black Diamond.
---
Just go to a water source like a river or pond and hit E (or whatever) as fast as you can.  You can gather 100 dirty water very quickly and then boil it even faster.  Pop a quick radaway after and you are golden.  It takes maybe 5 minutes tops and you have 50 boiled water which should last awhile.  
---
Otherwise I agree, just add a second recipe with purified water.  Or add a boiler instead of a purifier to the camp recipes.
---
bought the "shotgun" mod for it in Watoga, either the Station or the BoS Outpost 
---
On this one:  -Anyone possessing more than 3 of the same exact 3 star legendary items should be instantly banned or have their account reset.    
---
Negative. I have one legit 3 star that dropped and I loved it so much I saved (and became a plan/mod vendor) to buy identical ones. Those may or may not have been duped, but that is not my fault nor my problem and should not put any burden upon me.   
---
The rest go for it.   
---
I also use a mule now, should I be banned since I can load a character with 20-30k worth of weight? I am also sure there is no cap to the amount you can put on a mule currently. 
---
Yup, and there’s often other people’s contributions in similar spots
---
Let's not forget deaf players exist, big barrier for them. They even added a "no speak" emote to the atom shop,  kind of a kick in the groin.
---
People who complained probably are not fans of FO4 settlements. The real end game in FO76 is camp building. Collect every plans available and build a kickass camp!
---
I think this is exactly what happens. If no one shows up to a defense, after some time the workshop switches to overrun/retake. Proof being no structure is actually harmed AT ALL in the meantime.
---
This
---
Thanks for the post, really informative.
---
As for Yao-Guai meat, you can look in Middle Mountain cabins (east of whitesprings). There are always three animals there. Most of the times it's Yao-Guais. I had Rad Scorpions there as well.
---
With the perk that harvests extra meat I always get around 6 meat there.
---
But lets be real, Corn Soup is the MVP
---
Huh. I could have sworn I'd done that whole quest line, unless killing the SBQ is part of it. As far as I know I've only gotten the Excavator plans as far as power armor plans go, but I could be wrong. I'll check and see if I got and read them at some point without noticing what it was next time I log on.
---
Look at all them cronenbergs just walking around
---
The alternative is that they don't give a shit about save the world because it got trash reviews and the monetization was fucked to the point it was memed about before the BR mode was released. Why work on something that doesn't make them money? By the same token, the only way for Bethesda to continue making money off this game is with freemium level cosmetic microtransactions, so why wouldn't they focus on adding a bunch of that opposed to new gameplay content? It's what EA has been doing with FIFA for years and way over half of what they make is from FIFA microtransactions. 
---
Every played based trader economy that I have ever seen in a video game is horribly ruined and broken, even games that use or used auction house systems were broken. There are too many people who cheat to be rich and its dumb. The best thing to so is avoid it all together. I'll stick to finding my own loot or buying from the npc robot vendors. Those robot vendors should be fixed to work more like vendors from other rpgs. 
---
The dupers should be banned and the items they duped should be deleted from the game no matter who owns them, though I doubt there is a way to track all those items down or even tell who is duping stuff. Duping should be considered cheating and should be considered a breach of the terms if service, thus allowing Bethesda to permanently ban anyone they caught duping in my opinion.
---
1 shot it with a TSE dragon
---
See in fallout 3/NV/4 terminals were cool because they gave you backstory to already developed stories or random dungeons. It rarely makes you rely on them for the entire story. 76 is almost exclusively terminal/holotape based. Why can't you just accept the game isn't what some people like?
---
I'd say Bloodied super sledge with +power attack damage and +1 strength
---
is a dcg melee or unarmed?
---
So, you were told you were getting a micro-transaction riddled bugfest that would leak players like a sieve and you bought it anyway? I got it as a gift, what's your excuse?
---
I'm aiming to get the automatic mod for it since I have some perk cards which increases all full auto rifles damage
---
Two issues with having it as a mod outside of possibly being banned:
---
1) It requires everyone you want to chat to actually be using it, where as a universal implementation would be able to be used by everyone straight out of the vault.
---
2) If the mod was widely used it would make bethesda less likely to implement a text chat themselves.
---
I'd rather either Bethesda implement their own or give an official 'OK' for this particular mod.
---
Step 1. Accept that there will be raider RP.
---
I got them at level 15 from Watoga on my alt. 
---
I like 
---
Bethesda: "Yes."
---
Yep, can confirm. I have my camp right next to it. Cool place to farm ballistic fiber, wood and springs.
---
Why would Bethesda want to talk to a community that tried to destroy the game at launch? What makes you think anything they would say would calm any anger? For that matter, what could they have possibly said that would have helped?
---
If they had been more communicative during the launch, the hate train would take anything they said out of context and pick it to pieces. The haters really blew it for all of us.
---
Interesting, worth a try.
---
Perforating magazines and some Ultra-Light armor mods use it as well, although the quantities aren't large.
---
On twitter they post 90% useless stuff like pictures of players, nothing game relevant, it would be nice to know more and i saw the update but its like 2 important updates a month
---
its usually a "common" mod to get when you scrap Tesla Rifles. Try finding the plans, also sold somewhere in Watoga, and just start scrapping
---
How can one sell a generator?
---
Well one of two things... You have to many holotapes/notes in your inventory or you are a duper.   
---
Okay fine there is a third one don't spam scrap individual items, have a little patience the little servers can only handle so much.   
---
If it is not any of those 3 you are either lying about it or a lying duper as the game crash issue was resolved unless it is 1 of those 3 listed.  If it is the err...err..eerrrrrr... sounding crash that is to many holo/notes, though it can just do a click and crash also but I have only heard of that once and it being the holo/note issue, the click crash is you doing to much to abuse the little server that couldn't for you. 
---
watago station
---
I dunno about now, but when i got mine it was so broken it did absolutely no damage. The rays didnt even hit properly the enemies.
---
So i left my alien blaster at the overseers camp outside vault 76. 
---
I wonder who found it.
---
you're right. I got to 57 and was just bored and not motivated to do anything. So I started a new character to try a melee strength build and suddenly it's much more fun because of the quests (as shallow as they are) giving a sense of "where next" and the need to explore.
---
Whacking glowing ghouls at whitesprings gets old pretty fast.
---
Kill wendigos! Nuke whitespring, kill the wendigo at the golf club, respawn and repeat. Sometimes you get bonus screws in a paper bag.
---
The only mod for the super sledge is the Heating Coil. I guess they're "heavy rocket" by default.
---
Saw the guitar sword plan but did not buy.
---
Got an Executioner's Explosive Tesla Rifle yesterday, LOVE IT.
---
Decided to Farm Plans.
---
Gets Charge Barrel.
---
Charges and fires and 1 shots everything!
---
Get RADS while charging it.
---
Crashes.
---
Feels Bad.
---
Hey, thanks for the view. I appreciate the feedback if you have any to give. 
---
That’s sooooo nasty 
---
This is a disaster. Thankfully someone else has the problem. It is worth noting that I did report issue with Bethesda Support so they are at least aware of it. Here's hoping they fix it quick! 🤞🏼
---
Does excavator give same weight capacity on every level of the armor?
---
I agree with you that first party solution would be best, but my gameplay experience with Text Chat has been nothing but amazing; something is indeed better than nothing in this regard
---
I also doubt, given Bethesda's track record, the success of a mod would stop them from implementing the exact same thing conceptually themselves
---
It you grew to like Fo4 I suggest you stick with it. At least until the server crashes and other issues get fixe, along with a lot more balancing. As well as the hinky card perk  swap limitation new implementation that has been added 
---
Source? 
---
ala. Star Wars Battlefront II (and the infamous most downvoted comment in Reddit history)
---
It doubles the damage
---
Enclave stuff is pretty dope
---
That’s how it goes in this service-game. Live with it or go away rioting I guess.
---
Is it always generator plan you get each time? For me it seems I’ve hot some stupid bench last time.
---
I dump food and stuff off at both sites. The  overseers cache has very little space to allow you to put stuff in. It's  only a total of 20. The one at the vault is much higher.  
---
Just because it's a limitation of the engine now doesn't mean it will always be. 
---
It's not like an engine is this one bit of software that can never be updated....
---
That's not how it works.  
---
This is what Fallout 76 should/could have been

---
Wait till they get the servers stable and in a condition they are happy with then make one of the private servers they are planing into an RP server
---
That's because an engine isn't this static single piece of software.
---
It’s an MMO. Don’t lie to yourself. 
---
A strange holotape in west Virginia also has Sally talking to a a boy who was likely abducted by aliens as well. A lot of alien activity seems to find interest in Appalachia altogether.
---
But... I've been told that there were no girls on the internet... ಠ_ಠ
---
Free springs!
---
both the tan and the black pilot suits are available, I'd love some clean long johns as a craftable casual underarmor. 
---
There are two identical B.O.S. combat fatigues believe it or not, as well as army fatigues that go either above or below any combat armors. half my stash list is cosmetic outfits, as a matter of fact.
---
Xb1 the battlefield edition one. Like two or three years old..
---
Do they stay permanent or is it only for that server?
---
How would you disable marsupial in pvp and why would you want to
---
Sounds like you didn't defend it very well. One of the fun things is spending a lot of time setting up all the defenses. What's the point of it all if nobody ever tries to take it? They should be made much more rewarding.
---
Yeah last Xmas was pretty insane, I think the entire gaming community was united in that one, yet still it didnt affect EA stock prices or make EA change... that took a call from Disney CEO and the stock needed government regulations on gambling to hurt it. Most downvoted Reddit comment ever, no effect :(
---
As I watched FO76 launch and everyone was chomping their popcorn, I realized that I hadnt been aware of the 'hate train' phenomenon until I was on one for SWB2.
---
Two shot explosive 
---
Me too. Ez
---
Not all of them are closed, check out the ones in cranberry bog.
---
shh...dont give them ideas, we want player run stations not some atom shop bullshit. 
---
Doesn't overseers stash has a weight limit? I can't dump all my super stimpaks inside!!!
---
I’ve been playing since Christmas. Only level 9 but I’m enjoying it so far. 
---
Nope. The duper’s are acreal issue but there are other methods used by MMOs since two decades. A full wipe reset would be for Bethesda like saying: „we are a 2 people indie low-Budget studio... that’s why weren’t able to avoid the dupe exploits in the first place and now we have no possibility to get rid of them“
---
I wanted in game discoverables. Atom shop.. I'm so sorry, everyone.
---
Dude, put on your Power Armor edition helmet while you play. Totally authentic.
---
It's an absolute shit show of completely broken code and design choices, but when it works and it comes together it's one of the best gaming experiences I've had in a long while. I wouldn't have it any other way.
---
When he one shots my turrets and four shots me, there isn’t much I can do 
---
Guess I'm spending my next day off listening to holotapes and then ditching them. 
---
LOL wow
---
And so out'a place in the Fallout universe.
---
I’ve got a version of that, but mind doesn’t have the VATS perk
---
I’m not sure. I didn’t attempt the quest for it until I was already past its max craftable level and I’m out of the game for the night. 
---
I believe there’s mods for the legs to make carrying capacity greater, too. 
---
That's naive. 
---
Without a player base essentially playtesting updates Bethesda does not have the resources to create the thousands of weird situations and patterns that can cause a glitch or a dupe method.
---
Would love some 3 and new vegas outfits, stuff like the vault 101 jumpsuit or courier duster from lonesome road would be fantastic!
---
Personally, I grab every workshop I pass, build what is free to build, and then do one defence. That's it, if someone steals it, great. If someone doesn't steal it but empties what i built, fine by me. 
---
When I log off, I send random team invites, if someone takes it I tell them its Xmas and they got the bike then logoff :)
---
There's so little value in holding them, possibly with the exception of the munitions factory, and that isnt even useful IMHO, but the beta youtube videos all proclaimed it the best workshop, I think people still follow those old guides.
---
Go around the building perimeter and find every entry point. Put a lock on every door, and the doorway that doesn't have a lock, put a door on it and a lock. Then the only entry point is through the loading bay. Put a cement wall over it. Now they have to get wanted if they want to enter. Get Contractor, Home Defense 3, Science, and Fireproof. Get creative with the trapping and turrets.
---
I am not sure what happened to the military, but I think the mutants killed them off or drove them away.  Then I think the BOS came and tried to mess with Huntersville and most of them were killed, too.  There is a grave site down the road with a bunch of dead BOS.
---
I just need it for 5.56 ammo cause I burn through that, easy
---
Yes this! A random buff, and random debuff. 
---
The big corporate building in Charleston; the outside part of it. It's dark and mazelike, with many levels that will all show as the same place on the map, and you can snipe people approaching it.
---
Enclave don't use t51 armor! 
---
Just Nerf the fuck out of TSEs after they get the duping under control
---
Up until about 2 weeks ago, everything was fine I could play all day and there were no issues which is why I feel like it may be perk related. Something new I may have picked up and equipped 
---
Server based quest: you logged out, and it disappears.  :(
---
No, just you.
---
Yeah, I would like some SWAT/Special Forces military style gear.  At first I thought that was what the overalls was till I looked closer and saw it was a fishing outfit. :(
---
Let's sacrify him to Godd Howard! 
---
Sell it to a vendor, see what happens.
---
Yeah, it's a little known fact but mics are illegal here in France.
---
And a 1000 nuka is a 1000 caps 
---
Same here
---
I've been repaying the community by giving things to people who just got the game, to make this game slightly better 
---
2018, 2018 never changes
---
&gt; uhm, it's 2019
---
Wait, what?
---
Kids -- don't accept presents from strangers.
---
An easier fix would be to remove PVP unless people opt into it. Just make it so you can't toggle your PVP status for a while. 
---
As a girl I *still* don't know how to respond to this joke. 😅
---
It's  only 20. Took a bunch of cranberry cobbler there  today and forgot how small it was so took a bunch of it and other stuff to the vault. I'm not totally sure but I  think the dead vault guy might be  around 200. Am assuming pounds but it just has a number when you're  putting stuff in it. I never really paid attemtion to whether it was pounds. 
---
I have plenty of those as well.
---
Tonight I took one. I immediately got the defense quest with 2 SBs. I was low on ammo and barely got the launchers and vertibot up. I was having a hard time cause I'm new at SBs. 2 guys randomly showed up and helped me. One left a bunch of plans I didn't have for me and then they left with a thumbs up. 
---
Quite the opposite of what you were asking but I thought I'd share the nice story.
---
No thank you. I don't like having more debt than the United States goverment.
---
I had the PipBoy Radio mod in FO4. So cool to have my own playlist. Even cooler wasting some raiders to Metallica's "Enter Sandman."
---
Use it see how fast it crashes the game
---
I just want a pipe
---
Well considering Bethesda said they are listening, and asks the players to keep posting feedback and ideas... What's wrong with our concerns and ideas about a feature they haven't implemented yet? So you rather let Bethesda do what they want, and then complain. Opposed to collectively discussing about it, that might potentially help. 
---
If you aren't using power armor, it's also useful for armor mods, like the Shrouded mod for Wood armor that you get in the Mire.
---
now I finally have a reason to get Spotify. 
---
Wait for them to show you what they have done first?
---
I am curious what "category" it shows up under ("junk"?)
---
Can you "drop" it or stash it in a corpse so it will despawn? 
---
I’m disappointed I never explored photo mode yet. I came across a ghoul before a disconnect tonight that was floating mid stride of a run. 
---
Will you make puns when we achieve things? 
---
Like if we complete scorched earth, will you say "that was a blast!" 
---
Or if we fight a swarm of stingwings, will you make passing references to your ex wife?
---
Oh, oh, and if we fight a super powerful creature, and my spear is failing to inflict damage, will you say "I don’t think she’s getting the point..."?
---
It's a misc item, i cant equip it.
---
Oh lmao i tried
---
I'll buy it off you and experiment. I'm only use caps for fast travel anyways. Waddaya want for it?
---
I found a black powder rifle version of this a few days ago! My best drop by far
---
Small tip: build your camp on a floor higher grounds: put some foundation and build stairs. At this point you could build pavements on the stairs and mobs won't attack your camp. Yes, it's awful for aesthetics but it works.   
---
I think enemies spawn everytime a player is near a camp and they will begin attack you camp. 
---
If they made a better game they'd know what to do, they didn't so they can't. You're shouting into the wind. 
---
3* super sledge
---
I have the same edition. I’ve had 2 disconnects, one infinite load screen, and one crash all week. 
---
None of them came at tables or stash and I’ve been doing a lot of crafting to clear out my stash. 
---
AAAAAA, it bleeds when you melee it, or shoot it.  
---
Also I don't know if this was its doing or bad luck. but upon exiting the cave I was insta killed by 3 scorchbeasts. Still hidden and sneaking when they attacked. Just wiped me out while I was at the mines entry.   
---
Same. I always drop off my extra plans and ammo if I see a newbie there.
---
X-01, excavator, BOS combat armor. It’s worth keeping around. 
---
Get a black powder rifle, and start with a sneak hit, then criticals, all on the engines.
---
You'll get them on the ground in no time
---
Had this happen to me tonight at one of the power plants. Killed everything around, nearby, and on top of the roofs. And even though I knew it didn't matter, I went inside and killed everything there too.
---
Seems the only way to fix it is to server hop.
---
I personally don't. 
---
I had been grabbing them and building turrets and resource extractors despite getting disconnected from server no more than 20 minutes after claiming one, no matter what.
---
Then I realized building all those turrets and medium generators ate up all my screws and a bunch of other stuff so I'm just going to claim them and whack the enemies in the defend with my super sledge from now on.
---
Though today we had to defend a workshop from a scorchbeast so I'm less into workshops now. Ugh. 
---
I get them for the XP and free plans. 
---
Super sledge: +1 STR, +30% damage to scorched, +40% faster swing
---
That's actually the only 3-star level 45+ weapon that I've gotten. But I've lucked into getting a full set of 3-star armor, so that's something I guess.
---
Its an ok unfinished buggy game that'll disconnect you from the server when it gets a little overwhelmed... 
---
You'll grind forever to get to level 40 all the while seeing players that hit lvl 150+ because they exploited early glitches... 
---
Is the game fun? Kind of.
---
Is the game good. Kind of.
---
They released an unfinished game and hoped that not a lot of people would complain. 
---
This is why I let you guys fight mobs and get a bit weak before moving in for the assassination, or body block the target. lol xP Save my weapon durability and everyone's time. Also, that's my ballistic fiber you were holding. :D
---
They are permanent and move with your camp onto different servers.
---
When I play with lower level place I don't try to take them to farming place I'll tell them about it but we usually don't go there. What I usually do is help them with missions they need help with like the enclave commendations which allot of them are doing at a very low level and the brother hood of steel quest with the scorchedbeast the must kill and when I'm no helping we all just run around doing random events for fun
---
r/thishappened 
---
I've had workshops successfuly defend itself before. Particularly the Berkeley one. I didnt get any rewards but it self-completed. I even checked the map to make sure there wasn't a player there that defended for me. 
---
I think the game uses the same defense equation FO4 does, but the increased budget cost of turrets makes it very hard to get the workshop defense value high enough. I think part of it depends on the enemy type that's attacking too. For some reason radrats managed to overrun a workshop that had successfully defended against stronger enemies earlier.
---
First guy I met was 20 levels higher than me and tried to kill me
---
I can’t get past the first item in your inventory listing. Keep hearing “you’re going to kiss that boy!” In my head...
---
We fucking did it! We closed them!
---
Animal friend.
---
What does "3\*" mean? Sorry for the noob question
---
Yep sadly thats the case 
---
That map is incorrect in that I’ve seen him walk THROUGH the Whitespring resort twice now, right past the N guesthouses.
---
The screws are more from the super mutants probably. Occasionally they will drop 1-4 in my experience. There's a logging? camp in the very northwest of the game map that has a lot of super mutants and the warehouses there usually have some good junk too.
---
So ur sayin all 150+ are exploiters??
---
I grinded my ass off and reached 156 yesterday and i have 300hrs probably. Jst bcoz an xp glitch appeared b4 doesnt mean all high lvl used it. Get ur facts straight first.
---
Thanks.  Will have to keep that in mind around other's CAMP's. Workshops and around the Whitesprings. 
---
Fucking filled with bugs I can't even invite my friends to a team inside a server. IN A MULTIPLAYER GAME. FUCK.
---
But it's gameplay loop is pretty much why I had 250 hours in FO4. It's so nice to turn off your brain after a long day at work, just pick a direction, explore, and return home with some loot. It's fun and I love it. It's the only thing I play now.
---
They literally made an NPC that can do this and they did nothing of the sort. Kind of hilarious and makes you wonder if the people who made this game actually even played any of the other Fallout games.
---
more interested in that wood armor :O
---
I bet it's that damn overseer.
---
Mama got angry and took our toys
---
3 star "3 legendary effects"
---
It's a great game with a number of issues that you may or may not consider game breaking, immersion breaking or just plain annoying.
---
Bugs aside, as it stands it's a really fun game that's a little lacking in content. That's not to say there's not plenty to do, but depending on how quickly you tend to get through a game, you might find yourself left with only grindy repetitive tasks left to do, aside from simply exploring the map.
---
Bug-wise, in its current state, there's issues with server disconnects and game crashes, which seems to be more common on consoles. I play on PC and don't get very many, certainly not crashes. There's a few other in-game quirks that you can probably find more info on if you just read through this sub. There is and has been several item duplication exploits that have lead to a lot of players possessing some overpowered weapons, making the questionable PvP system a lot less fun.
---
Fortunately these issues seem to be being addressed. The game is in a much better place than it was 2 months ago on release, following 2 patches plus additional hotfixes.
---
I believe all future DLC will be free, the first content update announced for early this year (this month possibly - not certain on that) which promises more end-game content by the sound of it.
---
The game is really good, there's a lot of enjoyment to be had from it. I don't personally find the bugs all that problematic to the overall gameplay, annoying as they are at times. 
---
I think it is a game that you need to really stick with while it's fixed and grows. If you go into it with that mindset, it'll be a worthwhile purchase. If you're not interested in that, I'd recommend waiting a while before buying it to avoid disappointment. 
---
Have been trying this since I heard about it. I spawned a mister handy walking a pack of dogs calling out to them "come here boy, going walkies" etc.
---
One of the weirdest things I have seen in the game. All the dogs attacked me...
---
And this was exactly what I was expecting but so far anyone I've met, has left me alone, aside from the two people I mentioned above.
---
What is "that boy"?
---
each star tells you how many legendary affixes it can have, a 1 star item will have 1 a 2 star 2 and so on.
---
Right now there isn't any legendaries that have 4 or 5 stars but you can get a 4th on some gun by modding on a Scorched killer receiver. To check what affixes the item has on the pc you select the item in your inventory and press X.
---
I'm not sure if you uploaded a picture or not.
---
I place my money on a massive underworld map to bring the fight on the scortchbeasts.
---
Were you trying to upload a picture?
---
This response is in TL;DR territory.
---
Fallout 76 is my first Fallout game, so you can say I came in without any preconceived notions of how the game was “supposed” to play.
---
For me, I love the exploration and discovery aspect of the game. Here I can see how some have compared the game with NMS (which I also have), but for me, FO76 is much more continuous and present—all those warp jumps and monotonous space flights in NMS breaks up the game too much for me—walking through the wastelands provides much more diversity.
---
C.A.M.P. building gets me into a “Minecraft” state of mind, and I’ve spent hours finding the “perfect” spot and constructing a home—I sense a relocation and remodel in my near future!
---
The stories and even some great jokes, scattered around the game through letters, emails, graffiti, holotapes, quests, and such, add a nice touch to the desolation of a post-apocalyptic landscape; I play with friends whenever I can, I feel it adds a cool element to it, making it much less desolate—a game we can socialize with playing, without being too serious.
---
It can get pretty dry sometimes, but I spice it up with building my own Google Doc of where public crafting stations and resources are located, shared with my friends that play.
---
Bugs, yes, they are there, and yes, they can get frustrating when I’m in the zone.
---
Griefers, yeah, there can be some, but it’s easy enough to log out of the server; on the occasion that you do get taken out, you only lose the “junk” you are carrying… yes, it still can be frustrating, but there are ways to minimize the loss.
---
Room for improvement, definitely.
---
I’m still learning the game; exploring my equipment builds; starting to understand the community of players; developing my “role play” identity…
---
All-in-all, it has been fun for me. I’ve spent many many hours on it, and I’m sure I’ll spend many many more.
---
It’s a keeper for me; your mileage may vary; I play on PS4… maybe I’ll see you around in W.Va.
---
It’s Cthulhu guys. Go pray to him daily so he doesn’t awaken and KILL US ALL
---
Good to know 
---
I haven’t read the licensing agreement for creation club, but if they own the mod makers work in full and can use it however they want, for as long as they want, in whatever project they want, that might come across a bit shady to the hate train.
---
Holo tape about a hippy
---
As someone who tends to basically play his Fallout games as smooth talking merchants who just so happen to also be crack shots, the entirety of 76's barter system upsets me.
---
If trading weren't so cumbersome I'd be more than willing to pay exorbitant prices to players for their items, but there is a reason I prefer the vendor bots.
---
It's fun, but there's a lack of endgame content. I suppose you could do all the side and misc. quests, but I just find them boring.
---
Quick shout out to my man razorgrain soup,  the king of convenience.  Billings homestead workshop has approx 105 razor wheat just sitting there,  double that with green thumb, 30%  more with super duper and you are looking at 250+ soups giving both thirst and hunger per visit.  Better get woodchucker and good with salt though.  
---
Some legendary feral ghouls already have a green haze around them, so it wouldn't be hard to do.
---
I love the Grognack's Axe it's my def go to I have a 3* Furious
---
You know, I know a hippie. He's probably dead now anyway so it doesn't really matter, but I know one.
---
I like it. When its glitching it pisses me off, but when me and my friends are running around exploring and doing quests together its the best experience I've had since early WoW. Playing games with friends is always better than alone, and when this game works its awesome. When its being a pain in the ass I remember the fun and its less annoying then. Theres stuff I'd change, but nothing that I'm super butthurt about besides server stability, especially when a nuke goes off. 
---
This is the most horrible idea I have ever read on this subreddit...
---
I just wish the shotgun range wasnt such bullshit. Everybody I pvp uses the same gun, the TSE Shotgun. I use TSE lever action. I should not be outgunned in one shot by a shotgun from 100m - 200m away. Not to mention PVP scaling. As a lvl 140, I get smashed by level 50s and 60s while ill only do half the damage.
---
Good for you.
---
Grafton Radio GRAFTON! Grafton mayor .... Grafton MAAAYYYYOOOOR
---
Was going to say that supply and demand dupe all u want lol
---
Typewriters.
---
Well I'm sure I'll run into some nice folk at some point, I am also new to the game. It was the only incident I have had so far.
---
Time will tell.
---
Hope vending comes with extra camp budget to accommodate a shop front.  The square lights would be fun for this but very pricey budget wise.
---
You mean within the limits of the tiny build budget they give us without resorting to one of the base duping exploits?
---
Exactly this. It's all well and good having a trading system, both between players and NPC vendors, but when both are difficult to use, then there's rarely any point to using them at all.
---
~~Add an option to remove that horrible Power Armor UI.~~
---
Please, let me know what happens! I'd love to figure this thing out too! You're welcome, and thank you too! Happy 2019, man!

lmao...im at work right now so i listened to about 10 mins in...so far what i heard sounds like complete common fucking sense. gonna have to listen to the rest when i get done
---
I cannot explain how i did it, but let me try. You take huge huge one that looks like shower, you put him inside, with connector thru wall. Then you connect on inside part another conduit so you have 2 connectors now and your current can flow thru wall.
---
i WANT to start a raider faction. tired of all the cookie cutter gameplay. i should be under constant duress from players tens of levels above me, but im not. this game needs bandit camps, raiders, outlaws, so these fucking mercenaries can start earning serious bottle caps
---
This is extremely underrated. I can’t tell you have many times I’ve needed to craft something such as disease cure (because almost no vendors have them) to get rid of parasites or dysentery and have absolutely no idea where the plants are to make them
---
In fallout 4 creation kit it shows [http://i.imgur.com/B11badc.png](http://i.imgur.com/B11badc.png)

Todd howard making me play skyrim again.
---
Ok, I think I get it. Does the second one snap to the first?
---
The buried large metal faces has been down there way before the war. They are ancient. And they have been in every fallout game so far.
---
It's a larger story we do not yet know of.
---
I had the same result.  Came back again after reading this thread, and still it would not advance.
---
There are little bits that like a pipe with a connector on them. Some pointing up\[ and some pointing down. Some have no pipes coming from it and some have another 3 pipe parts coming from it. It's messy looking, sometimes they disappear when you place them, so they are like hidden in the wall or they have went up or down a floor by themselves. Can't even click them to remove them sometimes. I end up just putting a line through a door if it starts messing up and takes too long to get right.
---
Missiles are glitched against flying enemies. Do no damage 9/10ths of the time.
---
Yeah, you can use them as solid wires. They connect to each other, you just need to understand how they can be placed, becouse it is fucking stupid. Good luck.
---
I hunted a flatwood monster and seconds later a furious mothman attacked me.
---
The only place that sells them is the enclave bunker. How'd you get them who early?
---
Wtf, it takes less than 10sec on a water source. Spam the key you use to collect. You can get like 100 in that time. Then TP towards base and convert to boiled water.
---
I dunno.. Lotta suspicious high level players.. 
---
Your response is what a exploiter would say. Lol
---
Found it?
---
or just press the "toggle craftable items" hotkey
---
Probably this
---
on PC hit Q, im sure Consoles have a similar shortcut, shows only the craftable recipes.
---
A kill with a golf club: Talk about a hole in one.
---
A kill with a tesla: He was so surprised, I think he died of shock.
---
A kill in a Santa suit: Looks like someone was on the naugthy list.

Que The Who, Won't get Fooled again
---
There are a lot of things wrong with that “joke,” sigh. 
---
I'll have to double check! I'm on xbox
---
Could be fun....until people find a way to exploit it and then Bethesda will nerf all the incentive to do it. :-P
---
Same result, and i could not respawn anywhere.  All the map points were gone.  Would have had to exit the game.
---
Had my son log in, join my server, and I could then respawn to him.  But all the junk was unrecoverable.
---
Yes! Looking at the other ones that was on the map you posted. Idk why the interactive one is missing so many.
---
Are you saying it’s near the location called cliff watch?
---
Don't gather it with a pump then, gather it directly from the river/lake!!!!  Takes no time at all! I cant understand why people upvote such a "non-issue"!
---
I specifically said "recipe, plan or other valuables". Since when are steel and wood valuables? Also if it helps, I was typing this on my phone so I made a typo - meant to say 1500~2000.
---
on PS4 its pressing left joystick i think 
---
And the fact that this game implies the vines in the mire and the mothman are part of what ever this is only makes things stranger.  
---
We have a new mystery.
---
Still pretty useless, 10 min quest or just build a generator.
---
I feel like a jackass now lol. Thanks guys I'll check tomorrow
---
Your wrong. :D
---
Thats my point. It is neither single player nor mmo, because oif those reasons (and other). 
---
&gt;Well if that's all that got you trough FO4, I can understand you don't like FO76. But Fallout had a lot more than just NPCs and the rather basic settlement system..
---
I haven't said thats all that got me through FO4. If you want another reaseon why I played it over and over again was the possibility of role-playing different characters with different factions and different specs. Which I don't need anymore, because factions don't matter in 76 other than wearing the same costume and the new perk card system allows me different specs in one character.
---
I also haven't said that I don't like Fallout 76, haven't even hinted at it.
---
&gt;Why would you expect it to have MMO-like content?
---
I didn't at first, but then Bethesda made a game with a lot of mmo typical mechanics, without thinking it through to the end. The didn't find a middle way, new genre of online game. That was what I was hoping for. They just made half-half without making either half really good. An online game with emphasis on community without even an opportunity to trade other than approaching one other single player at a time directly. Again, just an example.
---
They have single-player content and mmo content without doing either right. The same is true for the mechanics. They didn't really came up with something new for a new format.
---
So... if I’m level 25 am I screwed? I made an alt specifically for these plans and I got a little carried away (melee builds are fun!)
---
It could possibly overflow and give you infinite caps. Even though I don't condone it, duping it could be interesting in the name of science.
---
I didn't see that once, does it pop up in the HUD? I tried using the terminal in front of the vault door at Vault 94 and it just said I needed authorisation from one of the religious guys to enter.
---
Except WoW was full of rich story, interactive NPC's, player hubs, ability so socialize with other players, more than a handful of main/side quests that could be completed within a week or two, and didn't crash/disconnect you at least 5 times per play session. 
---
CTHULHU!!!

I was around level 20-25 when started seeing people above level 100. I thought I am doing something wrong but then I found out about XP glitches and stuff. Being a multiplayer game, Fallout 76 attracted this type of crowd and Bethesda should've known better. Either way, people who used glitches just ruined the experience for themselves. I finished the main story because I wanted to know how it ends and then I created a second character to try different builds. This time I am exploring every location and I am just trying to take my time with the game. For example, I found all of the Survivor's Holotapes in Flatwoods and really listened to their stories. Even cried a little... 
---
What platform? 
---
No....
---
I think thats the name
---
Holotapes crash the game? Boo. I've kept every one I've gotten and I like to re-listen to them while I'm wandering around.
---
Can you please link me the mod that fixes it for f4?
---
I must be really unlucky only seem to find 1star legendary items that dont provide me with a benefit I need and im lvl 60
---
How are you guys so lucky to find op weapons
---
Could you pls link that mod that fixes it in f4?
---
Same with Xbox. 
---
Not if they can start to sell stuff for irl money.
---
Camp, camp, oh the pied piper??? 
---
.... A Mr Handy walking some dogs?? 
---
I knew it's gonna be shit, Bethesda is a disgrace.
---
I still dream on the day I'll play a real Fallout RPG game like the first 2.  Luckily  wasteland 2 is out and 3 supposed to come out this year, it's equivalent to Fallout Tactics which was a master piece, I really liked it.
---
Now just hoping for something else other than a Bethesda Fallout FPS kinda RPG game with a terrible engine.
---
Damn you Bethesda
---
Hey I just got a couple of the exact same one. Like 500.
---
How on earth would your character *not* say that?
---
You should 
---
I hope not.
---
You may need some sort of social life
---
That would be healthy
---
i'd love a protectron DJ to give some pointless chatter in between songs.
---
Introduce slavery to FO76 -- great idea!
---
Wood armor is pretty great in my opinion if you're going for a low-weight non-PA stealth build. I haven't found plans for the base armor or any other mods for it but I have a full set of lvl 45 Shrouded Wood Armor and it's ridiculously lightweight, increases my stealth a lot, is super cheap to repair, and has decent protection; I think I've only seen Metal, Marine, and maybe some Trapper armor with higher protection, and except the Ultra-Light Build Marine Armor they all weigh a lot more, and all of them are a lot more costly to repair. I wear it with a Harness with upgraded lining. You mostly find it in the Mire and in Raider areas if I remember correctly.
---
Just put them in your stash and you will be fine, basically we figured out it is a to many line issue when you hoard a lot of 0 weight items. So me and my friends now stash all notes and holos and we play crash free for six to ten hours. 
---
There is! Here - [https://imgur.com/a/gq36P38](https://imgur.com/a/gq36P38) (Waterfull 3 image, map location last image)
---
In a perfect world, fo sho. In our world, where Bethesda is working on The Elder Scrolls 6 and Starfield... Not too likely, unfortunately. 
---
They said a hot fix was coming to fix it tomorrow so it's not really based on faith.
---
Melee here, I keep a 50 cal in my stash for this.
---
One thing I noticed is shooting the body of the cargobob does hardly any damage but shoot the four thrusters it will drop quick. 
---
I'd sooner see them spend money on servers that  licensing music, which most people can just play from a separate source.
---
Pity the pip-boy doesn't have GPX
---
I have a grognack axe to but i didn't even know you can get more than 1 legendary effect ;D 
---
New perk cards were promised when they announced the system, I hope they have really powerful ones that only 50s can get.
---
How about a , charisma perk card that shares a percentage of your mutations?
---
Something like: "Half the potency of your mutation's postive effects are shared with party members."
---
Theyre mostly all hotkeyed so were good
---
As someone who reads every letter, listens/reads every holotape, and reads every terminal, I can honestly say FO76 has no storyline. Just a loose plot about the vault opening and some random lore scattered throughout the world delivered through a medium not intended for group play (who wants to watch their teammate stare at a terminal for 5mins while they read or try to listen to a holotape while another teammate is talking). 
---
Plus the fact that everyone is dead really takes away from the feeling of accomplishment when you do a task and becomes very much mundane and meaningless. 
---
Please no=( I don't want to have more servers and divide of people.. And I don't feel like starting over with all my plans,levels etc..
---
Lmao I thought I was the only one doing that.  
---
does not, there is a random encounter northwest of it, where the road and traintracks meet. if you run from there, its only a few seconds away and when you relog you end up back at treetop
---
basically if the place doesnt also spawn that creepy circle of mannequins, cultist corpses, fallen satellites and dead brahmin, then you cant tame the animals there
---
LvL 45 Mirv... 
---
Several fully modified Gauss Rifles...
---
My favorite Handmade.
---
So many other things now.
---
For the love of Sithis, LET ME LOCK MY DAMN ITEMS.
---
*And he was never heard from again.*
---
Ok but what direction from the cliff watch marker is that? North, south, east, west? There’s a lot of cliffs lol
---
As a slightly unrelated side note, spending Atoms to "buy" a PA paintjob has been a big QOL-improvement for me.
---
I usually carry two sets: the Excavator for fast travelling and the X-01 for protection. Applying the paint from the shop to the X-01 adds a little icon next to its name - which makes it super convenient to distinguish the two chassis.
---
yeah, i relogged and the yao guai was back at 16. im guessing the 91 scorched deathclaw is going to be the highest, too bad it wont stay that way
---
Thank you for the information :) I'll drop a bunch in my stash next session
---
Just give Rose some music to play.  Could be a quest.  Wonder what genre she likes?
---
Okay, because when you say "This one" it kind of sounds like you're trying to show something.
---
3 star legendaries have a chance to drop 3 star legendary items. They can add other stats like +1 strength etc.
---
The bunkers in the Mire on the eastern side of the map have quite a few fans, globes, and sometimes just loose screws. When I was farming for the excavator PA I would travel bunker to bunker and get quite a few screws and springs. 
---
Speak for yourself I have many people coming to buy from my shop that just happen to find it.  Though my shop is like a beacon when it is dark out and I have excellent curb appeal and location location location. Prime real estate all the way. 
---
yeah that map is useful, but there are tons. if you just run around in the field between the quarry and abandoned bog town in the cranberry bog theres like 4-5 just in a pretty small area. thats where i go to get new pets
---
Let's be frank, it's the support people who said that. Developers have all the tools to make changes to the game database.
---
Sure buddy im jst sayin not all high lvl are exploiter which ur little brain couldnt even think.. people played from beta could easily reach 200 by now. People that are 300+ were the xploiters..
---
*Internet Donald duck hannibal*
---
As has been stated multiple times in this reddit, they are planning for a hotfix tomorrow. Thats all the info anyone has thus far.
---
there are often reasons youd ont want to server hop, like having many people on the server, you launched a nuke, own a bunch of workshops etc.
---
I was thinking the little palm reader rooms would be great to rent as a sort of central player housing and since there are shops in the row already it would make even more sense. 
---
Again, rushing is a subjective term. It may be rushing for you but not for another player.
---
And as I have also said, it's not only about story content, the game is missing the mechanics for end-game. Thats not that easily to add in a few months. (at least not without breaking something else)
---
I have the following question for you: Are you sure it is not the whining and complaining from all those rushers that makes the devs deliver a better game? 
---
For example this announcement was the first time they said something was done for trading in-game. After many players complained about it, the personal trading system is exploited to hell and out of game trading sites and forums florished.
---
The spanish version of it is "comercio entre jugadores" which means "trading/commerce between players".
---
I guess it's either a store you can set up in your camp or a global marketplace inside one of the new vaults.
---
How does power user help you fly further?
---
In that case, they're the silly suckers spending hard-earned $$ on make believe.
---
S.o.c.k.s 
---
This is not late night show. Development takes time. If they have nothing important to say then there's nothing important to say. 
---
I'm not nearly as far in the game as the DMV quest but I've heard plenty of legends about it :D, looks like it'll be a pain. Reading some of the terminals at VTU which describe the courses made some of them seem pretty fun actually.
---
Please don't spoil the DMV quest if you reply to this
---
Pretty sure it's the trapper gear they work on isn't it?
---
It gives good rads to farm mutations with
---
No, they can absolutely make the tools to edit players inventories since it is most likely a variation of their save file format.  The problems exist with accessing that information efficiently (meaning tools for CS to just type an account name and see inventories) which you'd just need to make a tool for.  The other thing would be tracing items origin which would require new engine features, probably of varying complexity depending on how you want to do it (tracking all items constantly is out since the ref would need to be loaded basically at all times for that which would kill performance), but there's nothing saying that you couldn't add some sort of fingerprint to weapons.  
---
Hell, you could add a bunch of invisible weapon mods that are randomly applied to legendaries on generation and that wouldn't even require new engine support.  8 slots with 8 different mods each means you'd have to have 16.7 million legendaries generate with the same base type and modifiers before collisions are guaranteed, and you could effectively trace duplicates and remove all of them.  But people could still make money off of trading them even if they do get removed later.  Still, it solves most of the problem and opens new pathways to having failsafes for duping (like periodically checking if dupes exist or checking when interacting with a container and deleting any dupes that are not in a player inventory)
---
You got me, as I have no idea what that means.
---
Clearly Bethesda has to fix the game just because you deserved it so much.
---
Played like 90 hours or so and have never seen either of them:o
---
Lots of girls play this game.
---
Watch out for klutzy_mutt and igoodkitty though.  They are friggan crazy!
---
enclave is better
---
West Side, (Woods) between top of the World and the Green Briar Hotel. It's not on the cliff at all, full ground level.
---
My wife found it, while failing to follow instructions on how to get to Top of World up the Cliff face, Green Briar was how far south she got before realising she had gone too far and missed the way up.
---
Ah, no. not in this case. It was found late last night (10pm GMT, currently 09:30)
---
Nothing wrong with another aid in our quest. Thanks. 
---
Get a Gatling gun or .50 Machinegun, energy weapons break too quickly.
---
Lol i run tattered mole outfit and stalk people while holding a hatchet. Sometimes i stalk em for 30 mins 
---
This needs answering. 
---
My melee loving self is totally down for the dragonrend shout. No more flappy flappy for you, scorch beast!
---
Nah. I have 3/5 of the trapper set. Trapper and Raider are different classes. I find random Raider stuff pretty often, but none of the plans.
---
I'm curious as to just how complete and accurate this is. Guess I'll find out soon enough.
---
Very nice work!
---
Some asshole spread the rumor without any proof and the haters ran with it as fact so much that youtubers hopped on the bandwagon.   
---
I sell hundreds of plans and mods every week. I have never once lost anything. Now it is janky and you can misprice an item but if you are steady you are fine. So as of right now there is no trade theft just people that are in a rush and sell the wrong item and then cry theft since they went to quick and didn't pay attention.   
---
The reason I say it is janky is if you request something while I am pricing an item it will move it up one slot and price the item they requested. So do one item at a time when selling multiples and the problem will not exist. If the buyer is pissy and demanding they are shady and hoping you fuck up. I just stop trade and explain either they say okay or in one case get belligerent and try and talk shit to get a rise into doing what they want.  Block those fuckwits and move along with your day.   
---
TL;DR there is no trade theft it is an unproven rumor but you can personally fuck up and sell the wrong item to easy, but that is on you for being to fast. 
---
I like to have 20% health and 80% rads, so it's useful for getting somewhere in that sweet spot. If you die it automatically heals your rads which sucks if you need the rads for your damage and defense perks.
---
What a loser. Really nothing else to do with your life?
---
I’ve always loved these small details in Fallout games. A few days ago I found a random high level pick lock door, broke in and found a body strapped to a chair with a surgical table and a bunch of torture implements on it. I don’t think there was anything of value in there, it’s just little details like that that add depth to the universe and make the games so interesting.
---
What are some components  that use gold copper? Thata usually for aesthetic  items right?no PA , guns. Armor utilize those  resources? If not then I'd say acid/lead  or  junk/lead may be a better locations just for how useful the resources  are. 
---
People seem to not pay much attention through quest. It was restated like 10 times during free state quest that wood armors are meant for sneak/stealth. 
---
Use a 2 shot expo shotty like the rest of us
---
Near Watoga right? I found that one as well. I enjoy these little extras as well.
---
Honestly? I've not even bothered with it this time except for an hour two on day one. The ambient sounds are awesome 
---
Yep that’s right! Still hoping to find something that entertained me as much as the plunger room in Fallout 3 haha.
---
It's not "simply" a witch hunt -- bugs do exist.  Some players seem to have a much worse time than others.
---
But there are definitely strange people out there who actually get angry if you like it.
---
Bulldhit
---
Plus, you know, the whole hijacking a thread to blatantly self advertise is not cool
---
Write down every plan you learn in an excel sheet.  
---
If unsure, search excel sheet.
---
Only way I know...
---
Lol yeah, there is that one house near the Nuka Cola factory that has the cockroach with a tux and wedding ring, other weird things as well there.
---
No there isn't. This is literally the top of my wish list of features I want added.
---
It's to a point now that i dont buy anything because i dont know what I do and dont have anymore :(
---
I've had 1 server disconnect recently that I remember.. crashing to blue screen on PS4? Loads 
---
Ease up on the self promotion dude. Seriously poor reddiquette
---
Exactly, I feel like there's a storm of new players with the same stupid ideology as u/maplealvon who have this illusion that this is a PvP game. 
---
Meanwhile, us Fallout fans are trying to play this as any other Fallout game, reading terminals, listening to holotapes, taking in all the lore and these players come and "slap" us with their weapons and annoy us while trying to play the game as we did any other Fallout game before that and we enjoyed it.
---
I mean, if these aren't newcomers to the Fallout franchise then what did they do in other non-multiplayer Fallout games? 
---
So, you - u/maplealvon, don't you dare complain about the protection Bethesda has given us to enable us to enjoy this as a Fallout game even with people like you roaming around in the game world.
---
Yeah, the "help you sneak through the woods" bit definitely caught my attention, and got me looking for wood armor. I think I must have missed the relevant information on the ultracite weapons though.
---
Nope they were to lazy to implement an extra tab for holotape )like the missle silo one) for us so you need a pen and paper and write shit out, or just collect everything to the point that you know you need only 4 camp recipes (the last ones are whitespings ones so I know where to get them) 4 weapons a bunch of PA mod plans and a couple of the heavy armors and sturdy but I do not care to much about that.   
---
The combat rifle should not be .45; that is pistol ammo.  .308 would be much more reasonable.
---
Can't scroll the list, only the map moves
---
What are you playing it on? To be honest, I've never experienced something like this in an online game before but I've seen others talking about helping new players too. It's really cool to see people looking out for each other.
---
It doesn't, that's just a  general tip, without it I burned through over 20 fusion cores in an hour.... you really need it.
---
Without it you wouldnt get as much flight time, so technically it does increase how far you fly, Just not the individual blasts  :-)
---
What are the objectives I dont think I got this one either
---
I use .38 on my two shot  explosive combat rifle. Swing those this way of you're on xbox, GT: V ketchupp
---
It was a kid on a shared account.
---
Whoa, congrats! Happy New Year!
---
Same for my junk node on an undisclosed location in the Forest
---
Unfortunately I'm on ps4 
---
I got fusion before i got large. Really made me chuckle
---
Gatling gun with long barrel works pretty well
---
Yeah it is cool to see, I'm on Xbox. Probably 12 year olds trying to harass people to be honest.
---
The objectives of Uncle Sam, or Belly of the Beast?
---
This is why I keep trash legendaries as long as they line up with weapons i use. 
---
Fuck if I'm ever going to be a junkie, but at least now I can't scrap my .50 Cal. 
---
In workshops with a power box it jumps up to like 1k energy if the "powering up x" event was completed
---
Agreed. I miss the mysterious station from old world blues. I tried to recreate it in Spotify but most of the songs were specially made for the game so they weren't in there.
---
Power counters only count when the signal changes (hard to explain)
---
Connect a switch to it and flick it a few times and you'll see it count. 
---
You can be arrested and punished for receiving stolen goods, even if you did not know it was stolen and paid a large amount of dollars for the item(s). I have no problem taking all duped items away from people that are only guilty of not realizing they bought duped items. 
---
I was arrested and convicted of possession of stolen goods at the age of 17 for purchasing a bike that I had no idea was stolen. The person that sold me the bike got absolutely nothing done to hin because he was 16, 3 months younger than me. Down vote me all you want, but I hate cheating, and I hate cheaters even more. If this was a single player game, I wouldn't care, it wouldn't affect me. Multiplayer and pvp and now supposedly adding player merchant, those of us that play by the rules are basically screwed by Bethesda. I guess by now we should be used to it. Way to completely ruin an awesome franchise to allow the lowest form of gamer trash to have their fun, and when they don't get their way, they will pew pew to the news, and probably to their lawyers like the good little spoiled brats they are. 
---
I heard the psychics have managed to escape.
---
I really like this one, too simple and easy for Bethesda to not like this idea. They can even just paste the patch notes url on the announcements if they're so lazy. Although a scrolling text right under the atom announcements is perfect!
---
Never heard of it before, but it sounds more like they were trying to do some kinda glitch or something for that to happen.
---
New update: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abry8e/i_just_uninstalled_fallout_76/?st=JQEZTN0K&amp;sh=e1ab3369
---
I've been getting enough of that from the Red Dead Online Community! Lmao.
---
Right, but you're supposed to be able to set it up to pulse after N signals.
---
That doesn't work. It worked in 4.
---
Hello, I just wanted to mention I have not had an outbreak of HSV 2 for almost 3 years now (since the first year I got it). When I first contacted it (did go to doctor and got confirmed) I had a couple outbreaks that year (very painful) and then no outbreaks ever again. Like I said it has been almost tow years. The only thing I can think I did was I used essential oil applications on my sacrum. I did take anti viral meds the doctor gave me for a couple weeks after the first outbreak to take care of the acute symptoms (I didn’t take them for the 2nd outbreak later that year and now this happened in my life I can’t believe this. A great testimony that i must share to all HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS patient in the world i never believed that there could be any complete cure for Herpes or any cure for herpes,i saw people’s testimony on blog sites of how Dr.adeola herbal cure and sent to them and they were cured. i had to try it too and you can,t believe that in just few weeks i started using it all my pains stop gradually and i had to leave without the herpes the doctor gave to me. Right now i can tell you that few months now i have not had any pain, and i have just went for text last week and the doctor confirmed that there is no trace of any herpes on my system. Glory be to God for leading me to this genuine Dr.adeola  I am so happy as i am sharing this testimony. My advice to you all who thinks that there is no cure for herpes that is Not true, Here is his Email [dradeolaherbalhome@gmail.com](mailto:dradeolaherbalhome@gmail.com) OR whatsapp him on +2349027752454...OR inbox me on whatapp on +1 (758) 284-1397.../
---
I bought the game for my younger sister because she loved Fallout 4. Basically she just likes to listen to the radio and sings along. 
---
I’m confused. So west of cliff watch or west of white springs hotel? The map shows forest on the west side of both those two points past that little mountain range. If you are referring to that flat looking area going straight from top of the world to whitesprings then I’ll look there. I’m trying to find it.
---
The Robobrains recently had their loot drop tables fixed and now drop Tesla Plans. Usual quite a few at Dyer Chemical. Farm up the plan so you can craft them to break down. 
---
Nah, I built one at lvl 15. It sounds like either OP didn't learn it, bought a mod, or some other issue. It does need 3 points in gunsmith, but OP said they had that.
---
Lmao, I'm not complaining about slap protection and what not.  
---
There's just bigots like you with the ignorant ideology that this game is meant to be solo/coop pve only.  
---
I don't dabble too much on the pvp aspects of the game but at least I acknowledge that it exists and learn how to avoid being dicked on by other players.  
---
What are you even talking about?  If you want to make food or drink you don't always need boiled water, and if you do how do you spend 15-30 minutes on getting water?  Collect some dirty water then boil it, takes 2 minutes.
---
I have no issues with food/water and I hardly ever have to use boiling water/dirty water.  It's almost like you're doing something wrong, or not taking advantage of certain things or doing something.  It sounds like maybe you have herbavore so you can't eat meat, otherwise, you don't need boiling water for food.
---
What they need to do is have the option to make purified water into boiling.  Cooking with non boiling water makes no sense.
---
Wow, I’ll give this a shot!
---
Never found a two shot bullet explode in all my play time you to lucky
---
Uncle sam
---
Might just be some heavy desync or some other server shenanigans. Try relogging a couple times?
---
When I bump into someone who's being friendly (usually lower level than me), I drop all the extra plans and ammo I've accumulated, plus sometimes some food and water that I was just going to vendor.
---
good for you
---
Hear hear!
---
Sadly a lot of the advanced electronics just don't seem to work. Like the switches on powered doors. Sorry I can't be more help. 
---
I deleted this game for red dead redemption 2
---
Uncle Sam I believe is the Camp McClintock quest.  You have to do that to start to get access to the Enclave.
---
Be quick with what you’re doing, back out and take a break, then go back in. Best way to play it safe.
---
Best way to notice a problem is when you look at weapons and they start freaking out with parts teleporting to and fro, which means back out and take a break.
---
Fallout 76 is gonna be pretty empty after that. lol 
---
me and some of my friends killed the flatwoods monster and from the look of it we think its one of the zetas (zetans? what ever you call them) its got the same design helmet 3 fingers head  the suit in general and size
---
Which sub are you talking about?
---
They may as well just turn off the servers and burn the building to the ground.  Almost everyone has SOMETHING that they have duped. The bugs are literally that common.
---
Sorry to hear you had so many problems. I uninstalled it to a week or so ago due to a bunch of bugs, game breaking bugs actually. They would come and go and if it wasn't the game breaking bugs it would be disconnects. 
---
I saw it a couple times yesterday.  After opening and reopening my stash a few times, it finally loaded.
---
Remember Diablo III? Auction houses are actually pretty detrimental to loot games. 
---
We weren't doing any glitches. We were just casually playing and doing quests and exploring and after getting disconnected from the server and logging back on his inventory was completely wiped except for the outfit he purchased from the Atomic Shop. 
---
Lol me too, that's why I started fallout!
---
Damn this is the perfect comment. Helpful advice with just a dash of salt mixed in
---
This is correct, this quest leads you to start the Enclave questline. If anyone doesnt get it, then it's because you have already started/completed the Enclave.
---
Yep tried that and even tried leaving our team and finding a new server but everything but the outfit they purchased from the Atomic Shop was gone. 
---
Best offer so far. Actually, the main reason I'm putting this mg up for sale is its heavy weight (20+), so a gun like that of high value and low weight is ideal. Is it lvl 40-50? Also curious how the explosive effect works with the arc-- will it only explode on first contact, or proc another explosion with each arc? Interested either way.
---
Correct and I have no expectations for them to do that. That would be insane.
---
To repay the community when I was playing it I was running around acting as a crazy NPC. Sometimes I even killed some people depending on how they reacted. No joke. I was the crazy firebreather axe of voodoo wielding cult leader. 
---
Can confirm
---
Grow mutfruit and corn. Get purified water. Make veg starch and break it down
---
Who cares game is dead already
---
I heard some chems are made with it, but I haven't seen any myself.
---
But where is the Three Dog?
---
Solo launch a nuke.  Get d/c'd.  Wait, thats a good way to get screwed.
---
And i'll never ever do it again!
---
I pre order the game. Played for a few weeks after launch. Between the game breaking glitches, the bad rng, and lack of stuff to do, i stopped playing it about 3 weeks ago. The state of the game may have improved, but i was honestly too bored to play it. I may go back after a dlc.
---
If you enjoy it, more power to you, i hope you continue to enjoy it, but the "witch hunt" was totally valid, imo
---
BGS don't need to deleted duped items, they need to balance two shot and explosive legendary effects by putting a 3 second cooldown on each.
---
Im pretty sure it can give you higher star legendary loot but im not sure
---
There was ample info that Fallout 76 was going to be a multiplayer game and that there was going to be pvp. Pity the game wasn't what some people expected to be right?  
---
&gt;  there's lots of assholes that found an exploit in the game that allows them to steal your legendary weapons and armor or even take all your inventory
---
It is almost certain that if this bug ever existed it was patched almost a month ago.
---
I just hate how every new expansion needs to make the old stuff irrelevant. And now there's effectively a gear reset every time a raid comes out. Its not the World of Warcraft I want to play. I farmed BFA as hard as I have 76. I got Heart level 30 when people where reaching 23-24. I play games I like an ungodly amount. But they just killed all hope I have for WoW.
---
Happening to me right now, cannot launch a nuke
---

---
You should add them as friends so you can play with them in the future. Friends definitely make this game more enjoyable and less mundane. 
---
Hmmm. No option to store it unless I store my entire house?
---
Yes, its as bad as they say. Also for some reason Bethesda hates us. I dunno why. But everytime they go to open their mouths or just do something "FOR THE FANS" it ends with them scamming or just pissing on us..I dunno what we did to them other than buy their games but yeaaaaa...Theeeey do not like us.
---
I had an old history teacher that did this. We asked him about it and he said it was something that caught on a long time ago. Not really sure what he was talking about though.
---
I get quitting if the game bugs you but we don’t really care to know. 
---
What do you mean, I am simply acting as a anchor to force spawns.  Everyone wins in this situation. Not sure how this would generate any hate. 
---
Working on it. Once AFL season kicks off again Ill have things to do on weekends. But for now 76 is life.
---
Sorry, Raiders are better. 
---
Management team screwed over some talented and hardworking devs potentially ruining their reputations permanently.
---
Or you could go with poorly executed game with moments of brilliance. Pretty much the same thing.
---
Some say it is still broke to this very day.
---
is likely canon for fallout. 
---
Damn, tried a hard-relog like closing the launcher and everything and starting over again?  
---
Planty gold, my friend. Thank you. 
---
You say haters, most of the people outside of this subreddit would say Smart people. Haters didn't blow anything for you people, Bethesda did. Jeez.
---
All hail the cult!
---
it's just living up to their name. Zero Sun.
---
Thought the same thing when I bought it a week after release, I was wrong.
---
Game is trash, at least you didn’t spend $60 like I did. You’ll find that out after your 3rd crash/quest log not showing/everything else’s with this hot garbage.
---
In all fairness its cosmetic....and I've gained over 5k atoms in a month.
---
do the events at thundermoutain power plants for defending the workshop.  
---
more then half the time you get adhesives from the mobs that spawn there. like... a LOT 
---
Tag adhesive as an material you want to find and just collect everything that pops up on with it. Also you can farm caps and just buy up all the bulk adhesive vendors have to offer. I stocked up around 500 adhesive in a few days doing that.
---
I can’t actually even repair my camp. I’ve tried to “Repair All” and my entire game crashes. 8 times in
---
A row.
---
So they literally destroyed my entire base and I have to remake it.
---
fixing TSE would go a longer way
---
You can run around. You can shoot things, PEW PEW PEW. You can listen to hundreds of audio tapes and read notes. 
---
actually scaly should be rashy since if you'v read the research terminal of MODUS it "at first glance looks like a form of eczema"
---
The one and only time I ever saw him was at the parking lot by the tennis courts at Whitesprings, heading towards the bot cluster at the rear entrance. 
---
&gt;An online game with emphasis on community without even an opportunity to trade other than approaching one other single player at a time directly.
---
Makes sense since it is not an MMO. And global trade would quickly de-rail the looting mechanics.
---
&gt;a lot of mmo typical mechanics
---
What of FO76's mechanics are typical mmo? The timed quest gates are becoming a norm in a lot of single player games.
---
&gt;emphasis on community
---
Can't really see that theres any emphasis on community in the game. No shared, persistent bases in the world. No possibilities of building a clan. Not even a LFG tool. Except for the basic friend tool, the focus seems to be on stumbling over random people on servers.
---
Too late to help you but when my game starts acting weird (I had floor pieces I could not move, store or scrap and moving camp didn't fix it)  a hard reboot will set everything back to normal.  I have to do the same thing with Fallout 4 from time to time
---
Sorry, carnivore here:P
---
I just don't buy plans or recipes and I hope the RNG will save me.
---
It probably won't.
---
Remember to try again in a few months when extra content is out and hopefully the game runs better. 
---
But Yeah I can't say I blame you. 
---
1* cant give You 2*/3*, 2* cant give 3*, and 3* gives any of the 3
---
Should be like that Tom hanks film, only instead of being big you get turned into a super mutant and have many madcap adventures over 24 hours trying to convince players you are not a gunpowder pinata.  Or a buff.
---
\^ this, my sentiments exactly
---
Naaaah. Naaah. It wasn't. I mean I don't need to explain this really. It's just common knowledge that it really wasn't over exaggerated at all. Thankfully outside of this subreddit people seem to get that. So despite the "BUT DIS GAME IS REALLY GOOD I SWEAR" it luckly wont do much so this kind of mess doesn't happen again.
---
TSE legendary proc should simply be on a cooldown
---
Enemies with 1 star only give 1 star legendary items.
---
Enemies with 2 stars either give 1 of 2 star items.
---
And 3 star enemies give either 1, 2 or 3 stars legendary items.
---
The PvP aspect is so underdeveloped it clearly shows Bethesda didn't intend to have people playing it as a PvP game. 
---
At the core this is a Fallout game and having any PvP aspect is making it annoying for people that don't like being harassed by morons and griefers.
---
This game does have PvP elements but playing it as a purely PvP game is blatantly stupid and people that do it should select one of the many PvP games that are not Fallout and enjoy PvP in those. 
---
In the least the degenerates that enjoy PvP should not try to start it with innocent players that are enjoying the game for it's other, more developed and intended features.
---
There should be a Reddit so these people can post there farewells. I’m tired of seeing these type of posts. 
---
Food spoils relatively quickly, you have to plant them soon after you get them. There is a perk in Luck called Just Salt I think that will make your spoil less. I just try plant them soon after I get them.
---
You will have some entries called Spoiled Vegetables and Spoiled Meats under your Aid tab.
---
Do you understand the the dupe bugs are/were so common that YOU have likely done it? Played the game since launch? Ever had your C.A.M.P. stored? If you have, you've probably duplicated those stored items. Are you asking to be banned along with all these 'cheaters'?
---
Yeah, it was just the cherry on top.  Everything else wrong with the game has been eating at me since launch.  I tried to give it a chance and a fair shake (my Main was lvl 73).  The last two weeks have been horrible and tonight was it.  Maybe I will revisit in a year if they fix it.
---
Some of them are doing it for real life money, too
---
Okay, best I can do at this stage.
---
My wife was at the Ski resort at the bottom of cliff near Top of the World (Pretty much directly west), looking for a way up. I told her to travel south until the "Watch tower" marker was directly east, then she should be able to find a way up (She hadn't discovered the tower, so it was only a Compass point, not a map marker)
---
She travelled south and got to the Green Briar (Might be the Train yard area, can't find a good map), when she had worked out that she had gone too far south. She then started heading north when she found the "Fissure"
---
No Map marker for it, it glowed and gave of "Gasses" it looked like the collapsed ones and she walked along the length of the actual fissure, not just along side it. No creatures in the area.
---
Duct tape
---
It's too rare for people to give it away. Don't forget to collect Military Grade Duck tape, it also gives you 2 Ballistic Fibre.
---
Ever seen a dog with it's head stuck out of a window, happily barking at everything that passes by? Dogs gotta dog.
---
the camping pod? theres one you can setup camp inside of in the mire if you dont mind alittle mess ;)
---
No. This is current year Bethesda Fallout, where lore and tone are both a joke. 
---
Enjoy your giant vault boy head and amusement park outfits. 
---
Thanks for this list. Im about to shift my camp to an area with easy Cranberries and grow my own Gourd. Now I just need to find some bloody gourds. AP refill foods are nice for those of us who enjoy sprinting around for no real reason looking for stuff.
---
On the note of Blight Soup, I'm curious how it interacts with the chem Overdrive. In fallout 4 Overdrive was the only way to land critical hits outside VATS, and I believe its the same for 76. So an Overdrive and Blight Soup with a fast gun might be really effective. Gonna try it on my next queen with a two shot 10mm prime SMG.
---
I've started running spotify on my xbox while playing 76. Then my radio has whatever the hell I want in it. Immersion breaking but at least I'm not gonna have the same two Ink Spots songs stuck in my head for ANOTHER two years.
---
/immersion 
---
I am finding those odd scenarios I can unravel are more than making up for the myriad technical issues though. 
---
My raider RP consists of me using my camp as a toll booth. For keeping the road to pleasant valley station clear I demand a small token of appreciation in the form of charms, ammo or loot.
---
Not enough people play along, oh well.
---
Really...no one's made a joke about his name yet?!
---
Bah!
---
Brace yourselves....
---
Well, it's good to let go of some...deadweight! 
---
Ba dum tiss.
---
I concur. Junk doesn't require unique identifiers like items with variable durability/dmg do. So giving us all containers that can only store an unlimited amount of junk would take up just as much system resources as the current method. 
---
I feel like would be the same music from the raider radio in nuka world
---
I'd even be fine with Redeye's music. Look at that, he didn't write it himself, it was written by a West Virginia raider... Hint hint, see where I'm going?
---
The game is really quite fun. Endgame is a struggle though. Struggle to keep it going, for the time being at least. 
---
They could do like RDR2. Have each recipe have alternate recipes if you go left and right. Pretty much like how FO76 does workshop objects, but with recipes instead! 
---
Requires Tato as well.
---
Mr New Vegas was a robot... 
---
Make it, get some tatos, muitfruits and corn plants, plant them, collect, make a water purifier or two and you can craft vegetable starch at the cooking station.
---
I waited for a solid 20 mins outside vault 76 on New Year’s Eve for the new player that the map told me was there to come out so I could give them stims, plans and purified water (I had no weapons that would have been been any use to them at that point but they never transpired and I had to stop playing. I love doing stuff like that 
---
Hell in fallout 4 it rained through solid walls and roofs! Raining through tents is an improvement. Though it can be fixed further
---
It was certainly an eventful quest line with shocking twists!
---
The enclave will use this reprieve to rebuilt our forces 
---
Im level 328. I still find these stupid bastards bullet spongy, or theyre always too far away. Once theyre in range they go down fairly fast to an explosive assault rifle, its just getting them to come close enough for guns to do anything.
---
Not sure what platform you're on, but if it's Xbox I have one I'd sell you.
---
sounds like a scam to me...
---
Right!
---
They already did this 
---
Yeah the pvp aspect does need some heavy polishing.  
---
I'm not advocating that fallout 76 is to be played as a purely pvp game. That's utter garbage and you know it. 
---
&gt; In the least the degenerates that enjoy PvP should not try to start it with innocent players that are enjoying the game for it's other, more developed and intended features.
---
I advocate for workshop pvp as well as raiding people for loot and consumables. If someone wants charleston junkyard, they're gonna have to fight for the springs. No one is innocent if they're depriving others of multiple junk piles.
---
People need to take a step back and understand that fallout 76 is intentionally designed to be more dark souls pve/coop/pvp-like than borderlands pve/coop-like. 
---
The Beach Boys are a treasure, you stop your hurtful words.
---
Yeah, much as I like them, Wouldn't It Be Nice literally only works as a meta-game joke. Because we're all older, and we're together out there in the wasteland.
---
Insofar as many of the other Fallout songs are also included as asides and snarky references to the game worlds, on second thought, maybe it does work?
---
Fallout knows it's a game the same way Deadpool knows he is in a comic.
---
Should also warn you the vendor bot will just randomly die on you for no reason at all. As will his cow.
---
Sorry man - I am playing ps4! Where did you get your recipe? 
---
That's a pretty interesting idea! They could have certain Fissure Sites on a rotation to open and close, as I've seen a few unmarked and closed Fissures before, such as the one in the Toxic Valley. It'd mix things up on the map nicely!
---
Why do you need the recipe, you find radaway on pretty much every enemy. Instead get the Pharma Farma perk to Level 3 if you don't have it and you will find radaway everywhere.
---
Do the main quest line and you should get the dilution recipe in the earlier on quests.
---
This map is at the very least incomplete. 
---
Doesn't include Welch Station (he literally spawned a meter away from me there). Doesn't include Top of the World station (met him traveling through there twice).
---
My english knowledge is not sufficient to grasp your correction completely. However, the argument would be "PVP design". The phrase "aspect of the game" is a placeholder for that. So the reduced sentenece would be: It renders the PVP design ad absurdum. That sounds good to me. However, I believe you to be correct, simply cause my limited english knowledge could not match yours. Please be lenient with me in regards to my language usage. You might very well correct me, but there is only a slim chance, that I understand the reason why.
---
I have no idea how the power counters work but am very interested in knowing if anyone can explain it.
---
It seemed like there was a lot more functions you could do with them in Fallout 4.
---
a crit from an explosive shotgun to the head doesnt kill these bastards. They're the tankiest enemy ive come across. 
---
It’s Y2K. 
---
... and it`s the most hateful witch hunt ever. 
---
It even made me leave a whatsapp group of ol`gamer pals because they were bashing me so hard for playing this game - it`s ridiculous. 
---
The game has it´s problems but it also has one of the most interesting and varied gameworlds ever - i`m playing 100% solo and wandering the wasteland feels really isolated and sometimes even horrifiying. I really like that there are no NPCs because it makes the whole thing more realistic IMO
---
I`m already about 200 hours in but if Bethesda can fix the performance issues i will most likely join a group and play the game for the next months to come. 
---
I`ll take upcoming reviews with a grain of salt - if a game sounds interesting to me i`ll try it. 
---
Find anglers. They used to drop a crippling amount of adhesive. Now it's (thankfully) a few pieces.
---
Do a defend event or two at Hemlock Holes. I think that's the easiest way to get them.
---
This game will never, ever, ever gave a healthy economy. 
---
Games in the past have had immense amounts of time poured into developing player driven economies, and they all turned to shit (Ultima, SWG, ESO). Given that 76 is a small team of 3rd string Bethesda devs porting existing assets, this won't even come close. 
---
Or, you know, make different fresh servers.
---
Pvp, rp, erp, pve, and the mixed ones now.
---
You can't transfer characters between em, but you can make fresh ones on the new servers!
---
Ok. So now they build 200 things. Drop them, and make 100 more. 
---
probably planning to rework the nuking so that you need to use the codes and not just find a password online, as well as making nuking fissures more worth it
---
Had the same issue on ps4 took me reloading the game 3 times to store 5 weapons
---
I honestly have no idea where I got either of them. Could be an event, idk. I want to say I got one from Uranium Fever, but I could be wrong 
---
Yeah put the limit to the max stack that u can carry at you. 200 for example and u wont be able to stack them. This is causing the server to crash
---
Lucky bastard!
---
There is a middle ground between doing nothing and massive ban-waves.
---
First, the duping glitch needs to be dealt with (obviously)
---
Write a public statement outlining that duping is a bannable offense (and why)
---
Then, if even required, write a script that detects insane amounts of similar items (no-one should be able farm 10+ TSE weapons).
---
Notify dupers that bannable offense is detected, if they continue their behavior first ban is 7 days, repeaters will be permabanned.
---
The actual banning probably isn't even required, as no-one is able to sell their duped wares anymore (publicly at least) defeating the purpose of the duping aside from gifting the dupes to friends etc.
---
As for the removal of duped items, as long as it doesn't impact server performance(s), and without the real opportunity sell the items, players are just stuck with loads of items, at some point they just abandon their mules or drop the shit, who cares.
---
Usually restarting or switching server fixes bugged quests. 
---
Im up for this too
---
IF you can craft tesla rifle then craft them and scrap them, sacrifice your firstborn to RNGsus and hope you will get a mod, thats what i do with powerfist, cant find mods anywhere so i craft them, scrap them and after about 10 scraps i got 1 mod. Expensive, yes, but what can you do..
---
If you are below level 150 and complaining about paying customers complaining about the staggering lack of content in this game, please stop. 
---
What about the CAMP items dupes that were in the game around launch? Almost everyone playing the game at that time duped items, possibly not even realizing it, unless they were lucky enough to have never had their CAMP stored on login. You though Bethesda had a rough time with PR? It will be a pleasant dream if they ban all of their players, even the stupid ones calling for their own ban.
---
Make all existing items attached to the account, solve the dupping problem, allow for the post patch items to be traded.
---
You are fair with people that bought or trade their items without knowing they are dupped.
---
Its the perfect solution.
---
Or u cannot make more than 200 item of the same thing in one server. There is so many more possible fixes idk why they dont do it
---
Shit man I wished I'd get a TSE gun. All I get is exterminator and hunters shit. I ended up just buying all my good stuff
---
thats when you make them play along by just hacking them up with the pitchfork.
---
every lower level player i come across, I give them the option to drop whatever i ask for in a paper bag and walk off, or meet the pitchfork. most try their luck with the pitchfork, spawn, meet the pitchfork again. a select few have been smart enough to just drop their little doggy bag and go about their merry way unscathed.
---
Today i hacked up a level 14 and he came back with 3 friends. I took a beating. but it was the most fun I've had with this game since i bought it
---
&gt;If you aren't looking for a specific resource
---
The best to worst is without me knowing what you need and just basing it purely on the location/environment of the spot. I'm not rating the usefulness of the resource itself otherwise that's a completely subjective and 1 resource spots might be even better.
---
Even though it’s a hassle, repairing everything part by part is better, by the by. Repairing through the C.A.M.P. Takes double the resources for some weird reason.
---
A way you can bypass this, which you’d probably rather avoid, you can just move your camp to have it all auto-stores and repaired for absolutely free.
---
Sorry, people for the ethical treatment of deathclaws are better.
---
PftEToD
---
This is so wrong, that weapon do way more damage and it should, 861 is of course nothing but depening on your build the damageoutput can be thousands....its so unbalanced it is not even funny.
---
Todd Howard you son of a bitch!
---
don't they already have a kind of area specific radio play? or was I just imagining it? like all the mining themed songs continually played when I was walking around the ash heap and while they play in other areas they can be less frequent.
---
same. :(
---
The mascot hat from Uncanny Caverns(?) grants 1 ballistic dr :')
---
My conclusion is they kind of don't. ;)
---
In 4, you could wire them up and set them with a terminal. There was also an interval counter but that's gone in 76.
---
In my silly example, I used to make speaker boxes (set the note with a terminal) and you could make a little song with the interval and/or few power counters. You could do it with conveyor belts and lasers, too.
---
U on ps4? It must be a knew glitch
---
They did say they would consider raising the stash limit further in the future depending on how things go.
---
Feedback comment on storage. Couldn't see if this has been mentioned specifically, but with all the available costumes in the game, it would be good to have a stash-like 'wardrobe' that we can build in camp. All outfits (not armour) that we own would be available in there for us to change our style and not take away from our stash.
---
Either that or make clothes weigh 0 so that we can store more.
---
how many of these groups are there to join?
---
The legendaries are only ever 1 star, though, eh?
---
It's also a pretty good quest to farm up heavy combat armor if you don't have anything else to wear.
---
They already did. I see more and more people in discord trading channels who are ready to sell TSE weapons for caps. Couple weeks ago they were "trade only".
---
Sad face, i don't understand people like you. Could you explain why you do it? Is it fun?
---
Nuke access is bugged right now 
---
I can tell you off the top of my head that Ribeye and Radstag stack and I’m *fairly* certain I remember Radtoad stacking with those. Never cooked ant and don’t have the mirelurk recipe, though.
---
Just wait until you learn about the toxic goo at WestTek.
---
I use it to stabilize Unyielding. ;)
---
Nuke code pieces aren't dropping right now 
---
You can still connect it to a terminal and change the counter amount but I think in fallout 4 you could connect to things like a switch you could shoot or a basketball hoop that counts the amount of times you did something then you could attach it to fireworks and stuff. It seems like the stuff that made it useful are missing from this game.
---
Again, could be wrong and I am genuinely interested if someone knows how to use them properly.
---
When i see low level players i try to drop a bag of stimpaks, radaways, radx and whatnot but usually they run away and they dont see the paperbag.
---
Great hopefully is will be fixed in the next patch
---
\&gt;  The camp should get a “weigh station” where you can see how much each item is contributing to your weight. For example it could be used like a pie chart saying “Missiles are taking up 4% of your weight or “Bunker buster is taking up 20%” etc 
---
If they would just add a second kind of sort by weight that sorts by the weight of the entire stack vs the current one that sorts by weight of individual item we would be in great shape.
---
If you are under level 150 and complaining about other players complaining they have nothing to do, please stop. THEY ARE ENTITLED TO AN OPINION ON A PRODUCT AS A CONSUMER. Stop being a tyrant and play the damned game.
---
+1, but you should also look into Toxic Goo. Big chunk of rads from Goo and tweak with water.
---
It's meant to be repaired today;-)
---
Bring in the NCR Ranger outfit and I bet they’d make gangbusters.
---
Yeah im just saying thats its only use
---
It's a load of fun. 
---
Tried 13 servers. Not showing up :(
---
You get rads from collecting dirty water. You dont get rads from purified water. They need to add a way to make purified water into boiled water, or just make purified an option for crafting something that needs boiled water.
---
Big fan of your work Ox.
---
You can make acid with it, no?
---
Actually, I can’t disagree. PftEToD is better. 
---
&gt;What of FO76's mechanics are typical mmo? 
---
Doing events together like the SBQ. The game explicitly tells you it's recommended for a team. Thats basically the same as running a dungeon. Other events, too. There's a whole skill tree mostly designed to benefit teams of players. So one character can be a team healer for example. The loot container spawning for each player separately. Just a few examples.
---
&gt;Can't really see that theres any emphasis on community in the game.
---
It was marketed that way. From the first reveal Todd said at the beginnign was the thought what would it be like to play Fallout with other people. 
---
But again, you are just repeating my point. It wants to be a game where you play together with others, but it sucks at it because (and here I quote you):
---
&gt;No shared, persistent bases in the world. No possibilities of building a clan. Not even a LFG tool. 
---
So what is it?
---
- single-player game? Then it sucks at it
---
- a mmo? It sucks at that, too.
---
- a mix of both? Than it sucks at it equal to the mix of the genres
---
- or something new? Then they forgot the new, since they just recycled typical single player and mmo elements and mechanics. There is not one new mechanics or element in this game that wasn't there before.
---
Hot fix?
---
Not comparable IMO. Diablo 3's main and pretty much only aspect was and is player power progression, and the main reason it was so detrimental to D3 was the existence of real-money auction house.
---
FO doesn't really work that way. Sure it's a decent chunk of endgame activities to get the best loot possible and that wouldn't be that bad if there was a genuine way to get that done. An auction house would only help you slowly increase your overall power progression in a meaningful way provided it wasn't affected by dupers which is certainly a very real problem.
---
I stick to players 80+ cos i want good junk and higher levels, in my experience, tend to be more open to RP as at that level we have nothing else left.
---
Kill ghouls. They drop glue and tape which break down to adhesive
---
This post reads like a Buzzfeed list title in my head because of your A Million Little Pieces capitalization and I don't know if I should be upset at you, myself, Oprah, or James Frey.
---
Right. That all sounds right _but_ this time around it doesn't pulse. I can get it to count the pulses, but it passes on power to connected objects regardless of the terminal setting.
---
So your basketball hoop example would set off fireworks every time instead of just the third time.
---
We're also missing lasers. We have the trap lasers but they don't reset so that also stuffs up the basketball example. I think pressure plates are the only momentary we have at the moment and require someone to stand on them.
---
Reddit has a pacifist mode? That's fantastic! There is far too much toxicity in this subreddit.
---
Robotrons are people too organic repuplic: RAPTOR
---
Pretty sure you can also make acid with it.
---
It sounds like they had their account hacked if you ask me 
---
Indeed. It codes were supposed to reset but due to something to do with new year it didn't and broke things 
---
Unarmed, but it benefits from anything that increases melee damage (Twisted Muscles &amp; Glowing Steak).
---
do you? lol
---
Thank you
---
Admitted? Wow. THEY write their own tools for their own engine. Are you aware of that fact? So when they say "they have no tools" then this really means "we don't **want** to have this tools".
---
There's a mod that tracks C.A.M.P plans, but use it with your own risk.
---
I think if they just fixed the world containers it would at least seriously curb the duping.
---
The extractor is capped at 2 Bethesda units or whatever, but a cooler and artillery box are not..... What, why?
---
And fix the game
---
Just add the entire fo4 radio.
---
Do you mean Wednesday or Thursday that they will have it fixed
---
What about the one armed melee perks?
---
Yea I guy got bored after level 60 I couldn't grind any longer
---
Nah, only a small percentage of the gaming community is in your tribe, and only a small percent in the 'cult' you refer to as well. Truth is, nobody is listening to Reddit or Redditors. Most people buy a game and go home and play it, good ones played more and worse ones played less, and that's it. The fact that you think of /r/FO76 as a cult, and that you are part of the actual majority, verifies your naivete. 
---
If the Reddit outrage over Star Wars Battlefront 2 last Xmas didnt change the publishers behaviour, nothing is going to ever change from any level of Reddit outrage.
---
It does just fine against robots as well, like with Gutsies I aim for Thrusters...  not sure why you feel the need to be disparaging.  But I wish you luck and good day.
---
You are just wrong.
---
The gladiator perks? No.  
---
This benefits from the Iron Fist perk.  
---
It does however still benefit from things like Incisor, Makeshift Warrior and Martial Artist.  
---
I have a Bloodied DCG and I love it. Wouldn’t ever go back to 1HM/2HM.
---
Fix your flair.
---
Fallout has never been a traditional RPG, never will be. There never was assigned classes and job builds, just the SPECIAL system, and that's what made this game series...well...special. The core of all the games has been surviving in the nuclear hellscape with you and your actions being a central part of the narrative. Granted, as a Survival MMO, FO76 does not have a "multiple-ending, choose-your-path" narrative, and people are quick to label this as an RPG with the misconceptions coming with the title. 
---
The Perk Card system in itself is a way to nerf PvP and help everyone find their own niche role in the Wasteland. Unlike past Fallout games (more so in FO4), players cannot become this unstoppable deus ex machina of a man with all damage and resistance perks equipped at once. Players must meticulously pick and choose what to have on at all times to best suit their needs and playstyle. Just like actual survival, it is literally impossible to be prepared for any given situation. Many people have discussed having a feature for "Perk Decks" to swap between pre-made Perk Card loadouts at the push of a button would be very helpful for those who want 2 kinds of builds (combat oriented and exploration oriented) which would be useful OR setting "exploration Perks", such as Lockpick and Hacker, as "Passive Perks". Problems with the Passive Perk idea include a myriad of things such as the cost of "combat" Perk Cards going up or staying the same, do "weight-management" Cards fall under passive exploration, players becoming even MORE overpowered being able to equip more combat perks, etc.. 
---
So, in short, this game is absolutely not an RPG in the traditional sense and never will be, and the Perk Card system is what it is for a reason until a proper way to balance has been proposed.
---
"Cargobob" is also the name of a widely used military helicopter in GTA V, too.
---
Pls thicc iron
---
Agility will need pistol damage as well if everything else has it. Plus gunslinger is my build haha 
---
They wanna shit on and punish Bethesda. So likely not.
---
The game is already too easy, why do you want it to be easier?
---
This is me. 100% 
---
just reply with "true, just FBI and perverts" throws them off every time
---
I know you said youre looking for the plans for them, but i wanted to letcha know I found my complete set from one of those giant mutated crawdaddy lookin things in the mire. Right next to that treetop village.
---
Dont know if i was extremely lucky or if its a typical drop from those things.. But might try those?
---
I fight for workshops, but with explosive weapon. Why? Because that's the only way to counter explosive weapons. They are the best. Broken? Yes. But whaddayougonado. It is what it is.
---
xbox.
---
No, those are for one handed melee weapons. 
---
Then these 7 Ultracite EV plans I got from every single SBQ I've completed are worth nothing?
---
Dangit!
---
This is bigger then it seems in games
---
In a game were you pick up everything but have no where to put it.
---
Wednesday. 
---
It unbalanced, you know it because everyone wants to run with a double shot explosive shotgun. 
---
on pc patch notes duping is patched
---
wow Bethesda hire this man
---
It's diseased specifically. Diseased can overwrite (hide) the legendary affix
---
Idk why but maybe he could be of some help to the fire breat..
---
I’m in the 120’s and haven’t found any legendary worth keeping besides mission related weapons :(((((((
---
I got gauss rifle plans out of the safe there. Such a good spot.
---
Surely everyone have rad-x and radaways.
---
Eh.... Let it be a toggle.... I played eso and no one wants the actual vampire skin.. 
---
Good points! Funny thing though, radaway rarely drops for me even from ghouls. So weird!
---
quick delete original comment! you'll be forgiven. 
---
How bout some government disaster relief? Perhaps those Enclav..
---
i hear ya, im only a lvl 31 though. only way i mess with an 80+ is if its me and 3 of my boys on the prowl. all those lower level players get a crash course in RP
---
With regards to one of your points how ‘you can completely change your character build by just swapping the perk cards’ that’s fundamentally untrue. 
---
For example, let’s propose that I’m a sniper and have agility and perception maxed out, but then I decide I want to do a melee build. I’d then have to do a lot of levelling up in order to transfer my perception and agility points into strength, let alone actually upgrade the respective perks for a melee build. 
---
If anything this enforces the role playing aspect as your build is determined by the SPECIAL points you have invested into each category. Yes you can completely change your build - with hours of work - but not as quickly as you suggest; people a still forced to play along specific and related roles. 
---
You do the same thing in most games.
---
After my previous post I did go back and repair the base piece by piece. Thank you.
---
I didn’t realize it was cheaper either. Good to know. 
---
(I’ve never had my entire base destroyed before, lol)
---
Those red missile turrets that are found around Watoga, especially in front of the Asylum and Military Camps.
---
I tried double tapping the screen like it was imgur because this is so good. Upvote. 
---
Thank you guys! I guess I just expected more in the BoS questline. Bit disappointing, I guess. 
---
I don’t think I would be able to place my base again if I moved it, or I would. I moved away from “easy to place in case I move it” because of the changes to the system that just didn’t place my base if someone was in my spot.
---
Again, good to know though. Thank you.
---
That sucks, I did read someone else had a similar issue, must be a rare bug. Do you have pharma farma to increase your chances ?
---
Every junk with "military" prefix cointains it. You could get some from silos.
---
why are you still playing this trash lmao
---
We're playing on PS4. Is that even possible?
---
Thanks! Was able to finish the quest, but I had to be fast. Really fast :p
---
Yea here you go lvl 5 guy with 85 pounds of carry weight, here’s 15 fusion cores...Have fun
---
I do this because "why not" and i got from my parents, and for me, i think it looks nicer.
---
Try to avoid areas where higher levels have been right before you . The mobs will be a lot higher level and make life difficult 
---
I mean fallout is about making new builds and the new perk system is great for that anyone with 2 character at level 150 should make another character that's legit the gun in bgs titles explore lore and builds. 
---
I completely get your point. My thoughts were absolutely subjective and I was no means speaking generally. I understand Bethesda have dropped the ball massively throughout this release, but during my own experience I've been pleasantly surprised to find non of the issues I read about. Apologies for appearing selfish 
---
Excellent idea. It's always been in the back of my mind when they fix the weight glitch most of the duped items will vanish cause of stacking.
---
They can easily tell whos the dupers this way too.
---
Oh God..
---
Yup, I have enough crap saved up to craft a decent rifle w/scope, 50 rods of .308, 2 each of stimpack, water, rad-x and rad-away at the Overseers camp.  I find I get a much better reception if I get out of my Raider PA.   Many folks have mics but don’t use them.  My test is to sit on the road the Flatwoods, crouched with my stealth arm armor, and then just stand up when they get close to the dropped paper bag, then pop up just say “hello” real loud.  Been shot quite a few times, but I don’t do PvP (they are not lvl’d up enough in any case) and have more than a few friends since the game came out.  I don’t give out “junk” but rather critical stuff I would liked to have during the first 5 lvls.
---
Will report back in 25 lvls! 
---
Fixing the duplications will always be a cat and mouse. To allow for a mostly real-time trade at scale there is going to be some skew. inb4 blerkcherns because that doesn't solve that problem.
---
Dupers are unaffected by carry weight as mules are unaffected by carry weight. No one cares if their mule can't move. That's a bust, but I like it for other reasons.
---
The limited spawn when overencumbered was (still is) a thing and it only affects players playing. It wouldn't have any affect on duped items being carried. See mule above.
---
Ultimately, the cat and mouse will just fall to the most efficient item. You can carry a ridiculous amount of mutation serums, for example, and they're very much in-demand. You can carry more serums than maps or plans. Fun fact: if you're lucky enough to get a plan from the queen no one will buy crafted serums from you in-world: a) because blackwater, etc, b) "no one wants that duped shit", c) they already went on another platform and bought them from dupes
---
Fix treasure maps for sure.
---
the data is pulled off the game files so everything should be there for the categories in the top right menu. Only thing that might be wrong is if the map is misaligned ever so slightly.
---
Which with the leveling and peek card system is stupid. It let's OP high tiers mess with low tiers who are generally storying. 
---
if you open the list then click on the list window anywhere, it lets you scroll
---
Just a heads up.  Its not.
---
Also the white knight perk. I was struggling until I read about it and it has saved my life. My armor never breaks now and I have a surplus of ballistic fiber to make newbies and friends armor. 
---
Highly recommend getting white Knight and using trapper armor until you have a bigger supply of ballistic fiber. You'll want to keep an eye out for military ammo bags. Make sure you have ballistic fiber tagged for search.
---
Thank you for the tips!! 
---
I mean...a Lv30 TSE Shotgun will still destroy everything. Not as much as a level 35/40/45/50/55/60 variant but still.
---
Also, how would they know who duped and what was duped?
---
Found a legendary mr. Handy blade the other day. 
---
There're usually if not always Military Ammo Bags in Firebases and Military Camps (indicated as star symbol inside a circle on the map) around Watoga.
---
This can happen even in FO4 if you are really fast in spamming.
---
I was so bummed out when I got my Ultracite armor and it did nothing for my carry weight. 
---
Yes, but I've seen several maps that have rheir data "pulled from game files" that are wrong. I have high hopes though!
---
Good question! Just looked and I do, I've just got rank 1 though! 
---
After hearing this over and over, I tracked down the best of Marty Robbins and added it to the FNV radio... best decision ever.  Sounds great in FO76 too!
---
No it doesn't, just tried again
---
Buy two copies of everything and keep the copy in your inventory. It's what I do.
---
(this is mostly a joke, but also not because I have no idea what plans I've learned)
---
If their psn account is compromised then easily 
---
Why exactly does a stash need to be a hard limit?  Why shouldn't I be able to keep a collection of neat weapons?  Different suits of power armor?  A serious stash of crafting resources?  Food n water?  Ammunition?
---
I'll admit my choice of words was a little hyperbolic, if to encourage debate somewhat. But for me, I've not experienced any of the issues I'd read about. I may be very lucky honestly, but so far I'm enjoying it and just wanted to recommend people at least give it a chance 
---
I didn't know the gun was loaded and I'm so sorry my friend 😫
---
I love how you clicked on the post just to let us all know you don't care about it. A simple scroll past would have been sufficient. 
---
It doesn't "ruin" anything it's just not for you. This is a online game it shouldn't get mods cuz it can hinder others experience. This is a pure sandbox online fallout I'd say go back to 4 and mod that because honestly if u don't like online parts of the game ur not gonna like the game. There is nothing wrong with that but it's true 
---
So well yeah. If they fix negative carry weight, most dupers will be instantly overweight. Without stash store exploit, there'll be no place to dump it. So, enter solution max total carry with compulsory spawn inventory selection and we're golden. You may have it, but you cant bring it into your game. And once you make a sellection what you'll bring, everything else is gone.
---
There are few legit overweight wanderers, sure, but its a small collateral damage compared to the benefits.
---
Just a word of advice, this will likely not look appealing to an employer if you spend a lot of time in email conversations or making PowerPoints. 
---
That being said, this is really cool information and since I never played fo3, this was interesting lore. Thank you for sharing!
---
Thank you for your insight. Fallout76 is the first game I played from the Fallout franchise. Although, I have played Oblivion, Skyrim and TESO. So I magined that the RPG elements of FO76 would be similar to those games.
---
And thank you for the statement that Fallout was never a traditional RPG.
---
Thanks for the advice! Just found a fire axe, so this should come in handy! 
---
You know, that that kinda stuff is possible is somewhat of theyr fault and responsibility to begin with so no point in banning anyone.
---
Don't blame the player, blame the game.
---
I cringe every time I hear it in Fallout.  FO76 is making me hate my favorite songs now, too.
---
Be gone thot
---
Getting the thing in the right place is a challenge in itself. Mine most often end up on the roof or half through the floor even though they're green and in the right spot when I click.
---
The outside bits that you connect the wire to are extremely fiddley. I have to "aim" way off to the right for the wire to snap to one of mine. Good luck in the netherworld that is trying to connect two through-walls together....
---
As for the inside there are two special pieces in conduits: radiators and the connector (it looks like the thing you attach wires to). Most lights need the radiator, for example, but things like the terminal need the other thingy.
---
Actually no .... can't even say it was a nice try....
---
Ahh, fair enough. I'm level 133 atm, so low levels is kind of a no no.
---
Tinder.
---
i had alot of this during the weekend ,so sunday evening  i took out the cores from all of my PAs ,and stored the PAs  in the stashbox then quit the game ,and did a scan and repair  . After doing so i havent had any problems since  (fingers crossed) 
---
You’re a glowing Deathclaw that has Sith Lightning. Congrats.
---
I see your point. Sometimes I wish the nuke zone was locked to the player/team that launches the nuke. They make the effort to launch it and it is often ruined by other players leaving you with no rewards.
---
I'm on mobile sorry for the misspelling
---
You don't get it directly, but there's a terminal in the enclave base you interact with and it had the option for schematics. I don't remember where the terminal was. Sorry.
---
This isn't reddit outrage lol. but good try!
---
30 level shotgun will indeed destroy the world. No questions. Strong contender with the harpoon.
---
The assumption is that every in game item has at least two unique IDs. But that's wild speculation.
---
Really helpful! Thanks for the tip
---
While that is a good idea and an old trick of bad game devs when they fucked up and exploits happened, this won't work.
---
Explosive weapons are so extremely strong, as long as they don't add more harder content, i will still be able to oneshot everything with my lvl 25 explosive pump action shotgun. 
---
Not true, at least for Martial Artist. With a boxing glove, which also counts as unarmed, it's swing speed is definitely affect by the 30% increase.
---
thats where you're wrong, kiddo
---
Already done. Any decent weapon is like 5k now MAX
---
monster mash is quite the winner for me.
---
Oh, no, your still correct. I have a lvl 50, modded one. Only 4 damage. That's y I'm just giving them away
---
Ps4
---
If I see any lower lvl player than me being super immersed and hiding or tagging along to get exp on my kills, I make sure to leave them all the plans i have on me (that I’ve already read). They usually give a heart emote back, feelsgoodman.
---
Would also make the mentality of base seclusion and defense a very big issue! When people destroy bases now, it’s just a “oh wow a tad hassle with some resources lol,” but if this changed into lootable containers, raiders would be an actual thing in this game o: shit I’d be a raider lol.  
---
It applies an explosive effect with flat damage to each projectile, so since the Shotgun fires a lot of projectiles at once (even more so with twoshot) it’ll balance stupidly.  
---
Stack Demo Expert on this and you’re probably looking at a 1.4k DPS weapon.
---
I'm on PC too bro... I know exactly what is happening.
---
Agreed.
---
Ski suits sell for 11 caps with hard bargin lvl 3, low weight, loads at top of the world.     
---
You mention excluding the non-spoiling ingredients here, like salt, sugar, spices, pepper, etc. but I think those are important too for each recipe.  Like I don't want to stockpile a lot of a particular ingredient if I'm not going to use it.
---
I would hope that's the case. Would make deleting the duped items easier. 
---
Also I propose those who have evidence of duping the items and all duped items in their inventory and stash be punsihed and deleted but those who bought them and have no indication of duping on their account be left alone. The man who legitimately plays this game and bought one gun for 5000 caps like an honorable player shouldn't be punished even with the weapon or armor being deleted  tbh
---
HMMMMMMMMM :Thinkingface:
---
Try get it to rank 3. Make sure you hitting Y or your key to actually search the boxes and not just emptying them.
---
it's possible technically. you can read state of containers (like stash or player inventory) and check for suspicious patterns. but if they think increasing stash space could cause instability, who knows what sort of instability it would cause to read the state of containers everywhere all the time?
---
What's your strength at? I use a one handed melee build and a ski sword by default that (almost) one shots everything, but I also have 17 strength. If you still have it, the upgraded Blade of Bastet might be a good option for you. 
---
Thats the point with overweight spawn inventory dialogue solution. You cant enter a game at all (mule or not) without it. Thats items "rake" n1. Currently it wouldn't work as game declares them as negative weight. But, once you fix that, you get a actual inventory weight value. And then you can measure against.
---
As for serums. It'll just decrease their value at the bunker (where they're overpriced anyway), but they dont have unlimited use. You cant sell them to a vendor as they cost over 200 (even with 1CHR). So your only option is to vendor to the player. You can only sell x amount, as marked will get full quick as they are not multi use items like chems or ammo. Maybe increase serum weight too.
---
They need many other things aswell right now (:
---
Never knew that.  I've found shooting their hands works too.  Usually  if I shoot each hand once they die 
---
&gt;!The vines are from the GECK in Vault 93.!&lt;
---
This is circular.
---
When people play a game they play to win. Not my fault no one has mentioned nunchuku in the official rules of badminton. So what stops that?
---
The community. Did everyone lock down trading to only their trusted friends as if every item was a word document in an email from a decade ago? Nope. They played to win and bought that TSE off some random.
---
There isn't a way to wipe duplicated items without punishing the community. The next evolution of the game needs to be obsoleting what was duplicated after solving the duplication method.
---
It’s on a terminal in the same room as the enclave vendor
---
What's stigma?
---
Where abouts?
---
Yeah now a 25k handmade is at 5k or lower...
---
Nope not even that.
---
Maybe OP is an alien...
---
I actually like the card system. It's different and with a few adjustments can be a lot better.  Sure it's annoying having to swap between hacking/lock picking cards and ones I already have so a hot swap would be nice.  And I don't think the swapping of cards works as you make it sound.  Swapping cards I'm still forced to use the points I have, unless above 50 and want to move a point with each level up.  So it's not like I can have a 2 hand melee build that does crit damage then move out the cards and have a rifle build that is stealth.  Not unless I only put 8 points in each special and then I'm limiting myself when it comes to options.  The way the system is not for me seems more like it's intended to make a build then swap out cards from the build for what would usually be considered passive skills.  I don't always need to hack something or pick a lock.  I'm also not always scrapping something, making armor, weapons or modding them.
---
My biggest issue with the system is it doesn't allow for theme buildings and you're only able to have 5 characters.  Sure I can easily swap cards, but if I have a 2 handed melee build that is built to do crit damage my options are limited to one handed melee, fist melee, limited shotgun and limited heavy weapons.  Shotgun and heavy weapons I most likely wont be able to take advantage of some cards in other parts of the special not at least without giving something up.  And even then I wouldn't say making all those build types a theme.  It's not like I can make the 2 handed build one that uses alcohol and chems to do more damage then change to a one handed stealth build that does more damage at night from the legendary weapon doing more at night and having bleed.  Then during the day healing from rad damage and regenerating health.  This is where the issue is I think and having decks or hot swapping when you can't adjust perk points doesn't fix something like this. 
---
&gt; ... Fallout with other people
---
Other random people isn't a community. It requires some kind of persistence.
---
&gt; Doing events together
---
...does not make it an MMO. Only a multiplayer game. Borderlands is not an MMO, for example.
---
&gt; can be a team healer for example.
---
Team mechanic classes does not make it an MMO. Neverwinter Nights had team healer classes. It was not an MMO.
---
&gt; a mmo? It sucks at that, too. a mix of both? Than it sucks at it equal to the mix of the genres
---
Of course it does, because it is in no way an MMO.
---
You can grow gourds? And here I thought Raleigh's Trailer was the only source. That's a game changer.
---
I’ve seen it on livestreams. People have had their camp nuked at the white springs and they just did repair all.
---
It makes it really hard to read though. People expect capital letters at the beginning of a sentence and names etc.
---
You take 16 tons and what do you get
---
There are three or four military ammo bags at Fort McClintock (sp?) 
---
Read the notes and listen to the holotapes.
---
Bethesda's box interactions always felt rough to me.  At least with the majority of NPC's.  The character animation was just good enough to land them in the middle of uncanny valley.
---
For me I'm enjoying the holotapes based story immensely.
---
There's plenty that still couldn't be tracked. Opening a Nuka cola, for example, generates a new cap. Crafting a serum generates a new serum.
---
It could help with the flood of TSE all-the-things but there's still work to be done.
---
And no one cares about honor. They just want to win. If that person's 5K gun gets deleted ..... they're going to lose their mind moreso than if that 5K gun is now worth 1 cap. And honestly, what's 5K caps? There's only arbitrarily value in that. At the end of the day it's the focus on current and future consumers so that the wasteland does not because an actual wasteland..... because your 5K gun would go the way of your neopets...
---
Against duping. Its not okay to have 10 handmades and 10 shotguns. Sure, current solution is too tight. I too am having difficulties as out of 600, about 500 is scraps and crafting and even this is managed. 100 is way too much for other items. But, if scrap weight could be decreased by say 50%, it'll provide some breathing room to store some collectesweapon or armors. Not 10s of course, but at least a few.
---
And what are the results ?
---
Considering my initial downvotes, my opinion is VERY unpopular.
---
Just looted that axe from white spring yesterday off of a standard leg no nuke. 
---
  The one I got with my melee build does 254 base damage and its damage increases at night to 354 also increases with each consecutive hit. Cant wait to try it out on a sbq.  
---
The backstory could be like a sort of Special Task Force apart of the Responders, could have a whole quest attached to obtaining that armor. 
---
Can you make me one as well? :D
---
It just works
---
I would love to just take a mallet to their nutsacks.
---
Can't say that but ... I got the Handmade plan on my new 20th level alt this weekend at Harpers Ferry.
---
make a soup out of it
---
Another day older and deeper in debt!
---
I like my TSE weapon, If they would get removed, the same would happen to the game on my  xbox drive.   
---
My whole build is set for those weapons, I tried normal ones but could do jackshit even to the normal lvl62 ghouls.  
---
If you think everything is unfair just get your own TSE weapon
---
Don't worry about that. There's a pretty strong team of edgelords that lurk because they're internet triggered by the word "dupe". It's funny.
---
I asked for help in pointing out a cooler earlier. Someone called it a witch hunt. A witch hunt of oppressed coolers, apparently. The world would be a significantly better place if we showed more kindness to virtual coolers.
---
Melee is ace at low levels.  Consider taking the relevant perk for it as it's always handy.  Especially for Mike rats.
---
bcb
---
That's wrong as regards Watoga as I got the handmade plans at 20th there on a new alt this weekend on my very first visit. Also the Powered gates plan which I was actually more pleased about. ;)
---
Agreed, I've used a bloodied super sledge at near zero health and it does maybe 25% if it's not directly in the things gut. 
---
There are a couple of those fissuers in game with no markings.
---
Depends on if you want to be on this supposed ban train that's been going on. There is a mod for it, but, well yeah.
---
What if you happen to be lucky enough to have had more than one of the same legendary drop?
---
I am pretty sure when they full heal they are leveling up.
---
I got it yesterday farming white spring leg without a nuke. 
---
   My axe with my current build does 254 base damage. The damage also increases with night and each consecutive hit increases more at night it goes up to 354 base damage without hitting anything. 
---
I think the letting them heal just lets the game know "hey I'm special" before you dent the things head in or blow it apart. The whole some of them do not heal thing and drop shit loot is a naming issue and definetly a bug. 
---
No it doesn't. Not for shotguns anyway. Two Shot works exactly as described and fires one extra projectile. For shotguns however since its a spread of pellets it only fires one additional pellet. Exactly like the perk describes. 
---
can you describe the process of making this map? asking out of curiosity
---
Logging out and back in fixed it. I think it was a glitch that affected all my sellable items but I was so fixated on silver that I didn't notice it affected everything
---
These ^^
---
Sent you a message with the details.
---
Ha! My Super Duper gave me 2 x Herbivore Mutations Serums if anyone else wants one for free!!
---
I'm actually tending the other way. I got disconnected\froze on fast travel\CTD about 8 times in two hours while completing the quest and the DC while lining up my photo was the last straw for playing today.
---
If you still need radaway plan i belive i have two extra plsns i csn give you one 
---
There are 3 slots for Helmet... Mod, Paint, and Headlamp. Make sure you are looking at the right category.
---
If it just says "headlamp" then it's the default headlamp you already have.
---
Don't rush, take your time and explore.  At some point you'll get a quest to the south, keep exploring the north and middle though, in my opinion.
---
If you ain't gonna use it, Junk it.  Except possibly power armour.
---
If you find power armour with bits that are too high a level for you, use the transfer option, remove the bits of armour, get in the frame and use it.  It's still good. Or get back out, stick the armour back on and walk away. Power armour youve used will teleport to your inventory if you are out of it for too long.  It takes up the same weight with or without armour so this method gets the frame and the armour for the same weight as the franebonly
---
play f4, f3 or new vegas
---
One-Click-One-Kill --- Also available with any semi-decent build in any weapon type with or without a TSE weapon.
---
IIRC the mod uses the unfinished/deactivated text chat that was in the game files already. 
---
So it is safe to assume they will release it soon or later 
---
Buddy, they're banning everybody at this point, stop adding conditions to their arbritrary shitlist
---
Yeah don’t do this. It’s not a big hassle to get the plans. 
---
You have to have your perks set for it, all the rifleman perks and tank killer along with adrenal mutation, maybe a few more mutations for Max damage. 
---
On XBone myself and got disconnected. All my Junk has gone. Tried reloading a few times and still gone. Black titanium, everything. Not happy!!
---
👍 Good job… except there are between 9-11 split beans plants from in Flatwoods of which the most are on the right hand side of the church. 
---
By not be joinable I meant appear offline
---
Being proven wrong by Bethesda at this point would be a positive change, looking at it from a realist or pessimists perspective
---
I had a chance to see XP being given out to players from two monitors and two players simultaneously, for the same enemy. It was xp for the 91 glowing deathclaw kill and while these numbers arent precise, it'll show up the difference. The 1 int character received like 580 xp while the 9int character received like 590xp
---
Will have to try it
---
Indeed, sucks taking down a 3* just to get 1 star leather left leg...
---
Screw anyone that legitimately piled up (insert\_item\_name) to a point where someone would consider it unreasonable, right?  
---
Screw anyone that farmed legendaries until they got 2S or EX, legitimate or not, right?  
---
The PVP is interesting, but it couldn't be exclusive to the area, or it would screw the workshop design. Hopefully server hopping is fixed, and if you couldn't server hop and couldn't PVP for the workshop, you're just... screwed?  
---
Guns definitely need a massive buff. Melee could stand a nerf.  
---
Just to say thanks again - finally finished my unyielding set this weekend and have been having a blast. :)
---
that is why aliens stay away from us

&gt;**Muda Type I**: non value-adding, but necessary for end-customers. These are usually harder to eliminate because while classified as non-value adding, they may still be necessary. For example, while an end-customer might not view quality inspection in car assembly as value-adding, it is necessary to ensure the car meets safety standards.

dunno why people have to make up shit to make other people sound dumb to make themselves sound knowledgeable in something they clearly have no experience in. most petty of behaviors.
---
This doesn't offer enough of a proof to end the discussion, but my anecdotal experience says that there are indeed miniature differences bstween exp received on kills between characters, but I havent tested this well. To test this well, I think we should rule out influence of following variables:
---
Level difference between players, existence of received XP modifiers, amount of damage did by particular player (i.e. if this is not X xp for #1, Y xp for #2, Z xp for all the rest)
---
Alot of people feel this way, the Tse weapons aren't the issue at this point. They should be nerfed for pvp that goes withought saying, but a wipe like this would take too many people that aren't dupers with them. I would hate for people to quit because their mule gets taken down, that's not an exploit and alot of people and actually spent the money for the extra copy for their mule. I say just fix the dupe method and the dupers will eventually die out or possibly remove tons of items from one player that have the same item # like say a mule with 600 Tse shotguns. That seems appropriate.

It’s *cue. Like, you cue someone when it’s time to go onstage.

Re: the rest of your post - as a woman, I gave up using mics years ago, because literally nothing good ever, ever came of it. 
---
It's like a "you are what you wear" rpg, RS did that pretty well back in the day
---
Lil Judith, you've been saying you just uninstalled it since you created your Reddit account this month! You must waste a lot of bandwidth re-installing it so often.
---
And why do you keep pretending you are Switzerland and stuck up for the game and really wish it was better? Cos you personally created topic after topic shitting on the game, including the Bethesda Fans Blame Fallout 76 "Fake" Outrage &amp; Problems On Youtubers/Gaming Sites... topic
---
What's your angle? Obvs you don't want to say out loud, but I'll shut the hell up if you DM me the truth. Remember your first topic? &lt;"Hello? Is anyone out there!?" F76 Is empty and depressing!&gt;
---
Spill the beans, comrade
---
yep. fallout 76 is littered with such examples. people were even parroting that they wouldn't increase stash limit despite the patch notes saying they would.
---
I respect your definition of an RPG but the definition of an RPG has been so blurred in the last twenty years that no real definition can exist now subjectively. 
---
Today it seems any game where you have stats you set that progress as you level and some other character ability configuration that goes with it and you're an rpg
---
HAHA. I'll edit the post. Yep. Its why some of my wow guildies *never* speak during raid, only when close friends are around. It sucks because I want them to have FUCKING FUN.
---
Hard to prove that from internet strangers position but this is definitely what I would be investigating. Change the security stuff of the account anyway, thats a golden advice.
---
This made my day
---
If they aren't going to do this soon, then please give us the option to at least sell ammo or scrap it for materials for other ammo, and/or allow ammo weight reduction perks to apply to our stashes as well. 
---
We dont care
---
what if it cost $85?
---
The one that drives me nuts is when the compass glitches out and points you in the total opposite direction. It only happens occasionally and a reply fixes it. But not until I spend 5 minute running in the wrong direction. 
---
Highly unlikely unless you were to give your information out to someone (you aren't an idiot, so that's definitely not possible). My thought is the server is having issues syncing your character.
---

Why does everything need to have a purpose?
---
All in game items hold an item # if you have 5k Tse shotguns and their number is all #I359LKJ89B9 (not an actual number for anything) 
---
They can see 5k items with this in someone's inventory. It's very possible to remove them all. 
---
I lost some items in this game, a gun which I bought for several thousand caps, full set of power armor and some minor stuff. 100% of these situations it was me accidentaly throwing it away.
---
I even remember my excavator power armor staying dropped on top of my base, and me logging out thinking that my friend left it there and is crafting something nearby.
---
Why are firecap shrooms usefull?
---
Look behind you, a Three-Headed Monkey!
---
Shotgun all the way
---
5k caps apparently goes for $10 on some websites 
---
I was using rifles before, but TSE is boring. So now i have like 11 strength, but moving it from perception level by level. I can affort anything on market, but do not want to do mistake again, like 10k caps for TSE minigun that is now somewhere deep in my stash. And yeah of course i threw blade of bastet away.   But if you could oneshot everything with ski sword, everything with same speed and level should do the job.
---
Replace gamers with people and then yeah pretty much. 
---
Some people carry their brains between their legs lol it's just how it is on this planet. 
---
That's because hits are what register weapon segregation, 2 shots equals double durability reduction.
---
They're not writing software for a space shuttle, it's a fucking video game.
---
Probably went for more when the game was newer. Probably goes for less as the game gets older.
---
I think you missed the point.
---
Feel free to use this and share with your friends.

Armchair engineering at its finest.
---
Thats okay and fine. As long as you fit within weight constraint, you can have anything. I have two nearly identical 3-star ski swords, selffound. The solution would be limiting masses of items into the world. Not few. Current issue is not someone selling 10 rifles. Thats perfectly fine. The issue is dupers having tens or hundreds of thousands of nukas and hundreds of gg duplicated weapons. My solution would not allow duper to bring those in, he may bring 10 or a bit more or maybe few hundred nukas, but thats all. No 1000 maps of each or mods etc
---
In Fallout 4 you could make greenhouses with one of the DLCs. Don't see why they wouldn't be able to reuse those assets.
---
while i agree, it's not a huge leap of assumption to make, as pretty much all game support have policies to not restore lost items. on top of my head, world of warcraft is the only game doing it, and only very rarely
---
It’s just a video game buddy what are you scared of ?
---
Sure. You on ps4, happy to pay as well. 
---
Really? Never seen them before and I've been most places (bar Carnbury Bog) on foot due to Caps starved. And I'm certain i've walked through where is one is 
---
Good to know, they just need to fix this asap.
---
One guy near Overseer's first camp had a store front up and I saw over 1 million Nukas . WTF
---
Pvp should be purely optional so it's gonna be a big fat no thx from me at the pvp zones idea. 
---
Nah, I tried already. The value at a merchant will just show zero.
---
The weapon you've probably seen screenshots of damage is also two shot explosive dragon
---
Lower the view distance can help
---
New quests are absolutely welcome, if we put aside events the amount of main and side quests is incredibly lower expecially compared to previous Fallout games.
---
The duped items should hold a value in game say a specific shotgun has a value of #2569833985 (not the actual number) if they see theres 5k of the same items with this value in someone's inventory they could possibly remove them or turn them into some form of junk and leave the original. That way it won't effect the people that unknowingly bought them from people for 5-10k caps thinking they were legit. [my opinion on the matter have no idea if this could be backed up with fact] 
---
I got the recipe as a quest reward for a BOS quest.  Can’t remember which, unfortunately.
---
No way. I need those for my gatling laser.
---
Hate to tell you but levelling is irrelevant with the way FO76 is designed so beyond exploring locations (for no rewards beyond satisfying your curiosity) once you've done the quests and visited all the landmarks there really isn't much content. There's things to do like scavenging materials or collecting the last plan you're missing ... but that's just repetitive grind. I've gone to the extent of travelling around the map edges to try to find Easter eggs. Please Bethseda more content... I love the game so really don't want to go try another game yet...
---
PS: Weird find of yesterday was a raised platform covered in skulls near the north west corner.... very freaky... well played Bethseda. I've added it to my list of strange blood sacrificial altars etc all around the map. ;)
---
How so? This is the way 90% of games work.. 
---
We do know that items ARE in-fact tracked. But in what manner we are unsure of.
---
We just know that items cannot be restored.
---
Lowering the view distance can help but some areas are just buggy :( :(
---
if a target has some rads but otherwise is at full health will instigating do 2x dmg?
---
New dlc introducing three dog’s granddad 😂
---
There are many reasons to shelf the game. The fact it might be too easy is the least important...
---
Didn't miss the point, I'm stating the price that some people will pay for in game items... I think you missed my point. 
---
Really useful! I've been after mutfruit for a while, each time I get some I get sidetracked and they're spoiled by the time I get to Camp
---
I love the game. I play every day, for hours. I think it is as much fun as FO4 but even better. I’m having tons of fun playing the market with the in game community.
---
I really, really am tired of crashing once an hour if not more. I’m really sad duper’s ruined the economy.
---
Sometimes they show zero caps until you sell them something, then the game snaps back into shape. I hope.its that easy for you.
---
150 isn’t even high. Do you even play the game? Have you since release? Do you okay every day or no?
---
&gt;It’s not like some little old lady is losing their life savings here.
---
this part. people hate dupers so much but still are willing to keep any progress gained through duped items, as well as the duped items themselves? sounds to me like a moral cop-out; "well it wasn't \*me\* that duped, and i'm not responsible, i'll just enjoy this sweet item right here..."
---
i get it. you paid a lot of caps. but think about how much caps and stuff you've gained out of this super weapon you paid Xk caps for. removing the duped item should be the least thing they do.
---
Someone posted yesterday that enemied can take stuff out of containers.
---
So maybe someone was duping and a mob took it from the container
---
It's almost like the majority of gamers are inexperienced, hormone filled, teenagers.  Whodathunk?
---
As a 34 married man, I rarely see it though.  People are usually just as nice to me as they are to the wife, most likely cause I look better in a dress.
---
that’s my biggest problem, either the new players run away instantly when they see high level players in full X0-1 or they wave hi and go away before i even get my inventory open
---
XD. I play extraordinarily often. Its probably why I encounter it frequently.
---
Sucks for poor ol Tommy Jones 
---
I understand the feeling but if nukes only effected the player/group who launched them then fallout wouldn't be a desolate wasteland... though if someone could explain to me how those well maintained Whitespring greens have survived the last 50,000 nukes? ;)
---
Understood, if they can't restore them and they just start removing them it would be a nightmare for pr or whoever handles these things. I do feel like it would be easier to track down large numbers of the items than restore single things to people's account but I honestly have no idea how these things work so... Yeah. My idea should be taken with the smallest grain of salt. 
---
They were not ready for online. This looks like a modded offline fallout.
---
What was the point?
---
The question was "what is 5k caps worth?" and a narrative of "it's arbitrary .... the same as a neopet".
---
You volunteered $10. 5k caps are worth $10. Just like.... A neopet? Nope. Falls through.
---
Are your neopets worth $10? I think you got lost somewhere.
---
I wish this were the case this time. I've tried to sell to the Sutton and Charleston Station with no luck. One being a Responder and the other a Raider.
---
You know, I thought any bugs that were in FO4 that were never fixed were doomed to stay in 76 forever, but then they said they'd fix the lever-action rifle, and now I can be hopeful once again.
---
Are you going into the elevators? Do you have the quest to go into them? Do you have all the right stuff?
---
PR and Community staff. Its not a bad idea. issue is that we are pretty sure that it cannot be tracked/fixed that particular way.
---
Your clearance has been revoked.
---
I’m doing it now, but all I have so far is checking Charleston Hersld for info on him and then finding his bunker in the Mire. 
---
If only red eye moved to west virgina.. 
---
Im sorry to say it but this idea is indeed crap, you have some good points but this one is bad i hope you realise yourself where you went wrong.
---
I'm saying people will pay real money for worthless things and get upset if they are gone.. You volunteered your opinion and someone disagreed, I'm not replying to this anymore because I know you need the last word because you have something to prove. Enjoy. 
---
It's I AM become death not I have.
---
You probably just overlooked them. Vault suit, road leathers, raider leathers, shirt and combat boots, military fatigues, long johns, are all scattered around the early areas. If it weighs 0.1, it's an outfit, if it weighs a pound or more, it's an under armor.
---
Don't even bother with the nuke at Whitesprings. Travel to told club, clear it out, server hop, repeat. 
---
Happened to me with the stove too - _-
---
Nice I have yet to find any of those types of weapons so still farming the leg. 👍🏽😎
---
I've experienced this and heard many others say the same on ps4.
---
*Implying we have silly cosmetics just because of Fortnite
---
agree, one of the first things i did in the game was build up my strength and take as many of the weight reduction perks as i could because the game does a great job of making you feel like they are absolutely necessary, even WITH them the constant inventory management is annoying and not fun at all, i got tired of it pretty fast and i've honestly just stopped playing, there's so many little annoyances like this that all add up to a "mostly not fun" experience for me; it IS a fun game sometimes and it has great bones and it has the *potential* to be a truly great game, but the state it's in now i only have "fun" like 30% of the time, and that's just not worth it to me (Though i understand if it is for you; i'm strictly speaking about myself)
---
I definitely feel like there should be a "passive" area or classification of perks, as it is right now easily half or more of my total perks are focus on just making the game less *annoying* as opposed to making my character more powerful or fun to play, and "character progression" is a compelling reason to keep playing, "making the game less annoying" is not
---
Double explosive double barrel shotgun, explosive booblehead, overdrive. Stack up adrenaline on mobs. 4shots queen death.
---
I got it along with the Fusion Generator plans from the Powering Up Monongah event.
---
Quitting the game and restarting seemed to help.
---
It's fun, it has problems (PC) imo will only improve (bug fix, enhancements, dlcs)
---
I've been playing (solo) since the public beta.
---
Remember that it is not Fallout 5.

Attention! Try the two vendors at watoga and the one at harpers ferry then report back. Dismissed!

PETE DONT CARE WHO MEAT HE CHOPS
---
As a coder, I like your proposed solution a lot. 
---
So you're not even waiting for the 'honeymoon phase' to wear off before recommending it? No offense, that's kinda silly. 
---
Given that I'm 200lbs overweight  that wouldn't be a thing. But I found a work around.
---
Go to all the vendors. 
---
It's good for the disease aura mutation, plague walker or something
---
Shoot the propellers first 
---
Completely understood, I would love a fix to the whole fiasco personally. It's the same as when someone uses exploits or wall glitches in fps and gets high ranked in leader boards or something. Like per say Cod where it's not a determination of who put in the work but who can use the exploit the most. I know for sure people have been caught using exploits or glitches in tournaments, and I've personally (yes victim speech here) had someone kill my stubborn self over 100 times in a game of kill confirmed in bo3 because someone found a way to get into a wall and just aim at the spawn with an lmg on hard-core. Feels like I'm rambling at this point haha I can't get over people selling duped items on eBay from $10-40. It's just insane.

Yes user UNSCDARKNESS210 and nah save your stuff its free

Just yesterday I ran into a level 21. He came to my base and ran around a bit, stopped at my power armour station and did the confused emoji, so I took him on the start of the mission for the excavator. I'm level 121, so I had to revive him a few times, everything spawning was level 68, and they were super mutants, so tough too. I dropped 2 stimpacks at the end and explained over the mic what to do. I last saw him in Morgan collecting. I also had an opposite experience just after. A level 40 player attacked my base. Destroyed my door, a generator and my turret. I went after him, by this time he was 80 caps reward just from my camp. Over the mic I asked why and the only reply I got was pacifist bitch as he attacked me with zero damage. If I'd not had pacifist activated, my shotgun would have 1 hit killed him, but I want to kill the game, not other players. I'm Irish, most of the players in my world are Irish and I'd have to say they've all been really nice, the guy that attached me and my camp had an American accent. Now I'm not one to generalise, but so far every player who has attacked me and my camp has had an American accent. So I'd like to ask all the American players here, is grieving a problem in US?
---
Don't worry! You will be able to acquire these goods for just 3000 atoms in the Atom shop soon! Just as they did with the fancy blue dress from Fallout 4.
---
I was having some trouble with the vendors yesterday. I had to server hop a few times for my camp to be placed but by the 3rd server I was able to sell to the R&amp;G vendor and the rest.
---
It seems like the servers have been degrading since before Christmas. Little issues have gotten bigger and worse. Especially server stability. I'm wondering why Bethesda doesn't do weekly maintenance or weekly server restarts. Could that have anything to do with server degradation?
---
Due to a miracle, the countdown clock bugged and all nukes are locked.
---
Thus peace was finally brought to best Virginia.  
---
But, in the shadows, lurks an evil entity, diligently working on undoing this new found freedom from war.
---
Some can hear the whispers even now..."hot fix sooooon..."
---
Because, war...
---
War never changes.
---
Lol more range? The range on the shotguns is insane. 
---
I don't have the armor, but I have the plan for the deep pocketed limbs if you'd like it
---
because people wanting to fract ammo, stimpaks or other consumables would be severely hampered by it
---
My fireteam did it last weekend. We needed fusion cores, but server hopping as a team is a pain, so we captured and fired up all 3 powerplants. Nothing special happened.
---
That was brilliant
---
 The level 45 Blade of Bastet hits at 98 for me and has what it says is 50% armor penetration. 
---
 Its killer with just a few perks. Hacks up Super Muties real good withe the armor penetration.
---
I normally jst press jump again 
---
This would affect just normal crafters though.
---
Why not just do the easy thing and put a weight limit on all world containers, making the process too tedious 
---
That would be more of a managed state from a DB, not the engine. That’s like saying my car can’t understand what’s in the trunk, must be a limitation of the engine. 
---
Weird flex, but okay. 
---
Would have been a funny power
---
Imo, the perk system is one of the few things that were improved in FO76.
---
It is still a feature that can be improved, but I find the new perk system fair and funny. 
---
"Lil Judith, you've been saying you just uninstalled it since you created your Reddit account this month!" Wrong!
---
I mean. Jeez. Wrong. 
---
And I did stick up for the game and the people playing it at a time, as I could understand people enjoying it. The topic "Bethesda Fans Blame Fallout 76 "Fake" Outrage &amp; Problems On Youtubers/Gaming Sites" Wasn't even about the game really. I even stated in the damn topic that I was all for people enjoying the game. It was about the community and not so much the game.
---
Not to mention that the topic "Hello? Is anyone out there!?" F76 Is empty and depressing!" was a valid Criticism. Not me "shitting" on the game. You obviously haven't read my posts or you would know that I was in defense of the people playing the game and also the game to some degree but also not forgetting the mess it was and the mistakes and lies done by the developers. Of course thats changed now as after everything Bethesda couldn't help but screw up again.
---
Everything I've said has been the truth so I have no idea what your problem is or really even care. If you want some amazing truth, well the truth has been in my posts.
---
Mmos aren't the only games that have endgame content.  Very poor comparison.  
---
Ok, clearly I fail in delivering my point.
---
I give it one last try.
---
I know that it is not a mmo!
---
But it looks like one, smells like one and in some parts plays like one.
---
If it doesn't wanna be a mmo, than Bethesda forgot to include something that makes it different.
---
If it were a new genre, critics would not compare it to an old one. 
---
But since it is missing the new stuff, and mixing some things from single-player games and something from pvp centered games and some things from mmo, doesn't make it something new of its own, players and critics compare it to the thing it most resembles to.
---
Your original comment that I first replied to complained that critics compare it to a mmo. They are doing this, because it's the thing Fallout 76 reminds them to the most. 
---
I then tried to explain why that is, since most players and critics don't make that hairline difference between a mmo-like game mechanic and a mechanic from a mmo.
---
That is not the critics fault. The game (or the devs) forgot or was not able to deliever a different concept.
---
lol you rage quit, now you are going to just have to reinstall when they announce the new content. 
---
Give us a red dawn set! Let people go full commie. 
---
I'd love to see more bunker style or raider style camp stuff. 
---
I'd say I've done exactly that
---
This is much needed
---
Couple of things that might help: get some treated under armor to boost your strength and endurance and if you are not going to be relying on guns, go for the twisted muscles mutation. Also eating food that increase your melee damage like a glowing meat steak help.
---
 Swing speed isn't everything with medium weapons and you may get good results out of something like a high level Black Diamond. It's really about searching and finding the best weapon for you. I use a vampiric ski sword, an executioner's cultist dagger, and an instigating death tambo for different situations.
---
Just add batch crafting to anything that isn't armor or weapons along with the cool down timer
---
Looking for low level 2 handers melee weapon plans.

Honest opinion:
---
* It's a lot of fun to explore the map, often ridiculously fun. I mean I get a child-like sense of glee and wonder as I explore.   No other game franchise gives me that same feeling, although Just Cause 2 was close.
---
* The game's lack of polish (bugs, server crashes, canvas bags, etc) has caused significant long-term harm to the reputation of the Fallout franchise.  They rushed to get it out before Christmas, and it shows.
---
* The depth of the storytelling embedded in this game is fantastic, one of the best I've ever played.  But they don't spell it out, you have to work for it.   Which is why many people think it doesn't have a good story.
---
* The combat model doesn't work very well - headshot snipers, melee bashers and cheesy legendaries are the only effective options I've seen
---
* The consensual PVP mechanic ends up being a horrible compromise that doesn't work very well.  Mostly because of the cheesy legendaries
---
* Getting to explore the wasteland with my friends is delightful and every time I get to play with friends it makes the game twice as much fun
---
* I think they'll figure out the bugs and server crashes.  I think they'll find some ways to balance the weapons better.  I think they'll figure out some ways to make the PvP model work better.   In several months, it will be a much better game than it is today, and it's already a fun game. 
---
When you place the shower looking one on a wall, you can go to the other side of the wall and move around another piece, like the small pipe, and it will snap when it hits the top or bottom section.  The pipes/conduits and connectors can also be placed on a roof easily.  The slanted roof is the easiest to do this with.
---
The need to rework pacifism completely.
---
First, you shouldn't be able to target friendlies in VATS at all, let alone in pacifist mode.
---
Second, pacifism should work like it does in GTAV Online.  You can't hurt others, they can't hurt you.  To stop people from just turning it on and off to grief, there is a cooldown period between switching.  
---
Other than bounties and agreed upon PVP, there is no other reason to damage other players.  An argument could be made for workshops, but you only need to be able to attack players taking your workshop.  You don't need to attack to take one from somebody else.
---
If you are in pacifist mode and taking a workshop, you should get a notification that doing so will disable pacifism.  Same with stealing from CAMPS and workshops.
---
"*DoNt PlAy A GAmE WiTh PvP ThEn!*"
---
Just because it has PVP doesn't mean I should be forced into PVP.  With some games, I accept that.  But if the game has a mechanic designed to strictly avoid PVP it should work to avoid PVP.  I don't mind getting into scraps, but sometimes I just want to go about my business and play peacefully.
---
Lots of people here seem to be totally against the idea of PVP-centric servers, but most online games that have PVE &amp; PVP do just that and it works for them and their players.
---
Not really, you just dupe a million nuka cola, and write an autohotkey script to drink 25k of them every time you need caps. All in all less than an hours work
---
This could work but not a cooldown. Maybe a set amount for every time you enter a crafting bench. 
---
The dupers require a large batch to lag themselves out. Maybe put a limit on amount of crafts per use. 
---
Go onto bench, craft ten times have to exit and re-enter. This would allow normal crafters to carry on crafting but stop the large batches that lag the dupers out. 
---
Maybe make the game auto save your progress upon exiting a bench as well could work in conjunction so they are stuck with what they craft. 
---
Won’t happen if it’s content from the game Bethesda don’t speak of. It’s embarrassing that the best fallout RPG is one they didn’t make and was thrown together in 18 months.
---
Where the hell do I turn it in....level 105 and I just sell them for 1 cap lol
---
Yeah I tried both. Laying down for about 20 minutes and no disease at all. I was even at -50% disease resist because I was starving but nothing. 
---
If you drop another one somewhere else, the first one disappears.
---
Corpses act like storage boxes and you can fill multiple and the items stay.  I have tested it.
---
I was lv.20 and I met a lv.52 with power armor and legendary weapons who wanted to trade. "It's okay -I thought - but what does he want from me?" I need some purified water and he had 15 so I requested it. He was interested in ultracite ore (1) and I didn't know how to use it. I set the price: 15caps and he payed. But what about the purified water he wanted to sold? 30 caps. Man, this is unfair, purified water is more common than ultracite ore. Well, maybe I was naive, but rarely players I've met were kind. Frequently they try to screw you. 
---
&gt;The little waterway by the Alpine River Cabins has some small waterfalls and rapids.
---
Is that the one that also has the sound of a woman screaming coming from nearby? I spent a half hour trying to figure out where that was coming from, to no avail.
---
If I remember correctly, the one who land the killing blow get a tad more xp. Vaguely remember it from the documentary. But I might be wrong, anyone can confirm?
---
Put away/pull out you weapon just before you land, you do that animation rather than the landing. 
---
They made a game out of people getting side tracked on their way to the next main quest.

I personally think that isn't that bad, but they kind of just gutted out the rp in rpg. Sure, you have rpg mechanics, but mechanics doesn't really make a rpg, does it? :l  
---
Right now it just feels like a box of sand with no toys, and getting launched out of the sandbox randomly or other fellow babies coming in to give you a hot french kiss once in a w-i don't know where i was going with that nevermind.
---
Just going off memory, like your username though 
---
I hereby proclaim the Gary faction, where equality of all GARYs is of pinnacle importance 
---
it's 43 caps with hard bargain in my experience
---
Bethesda has stated they don’t have the backend tools to do that. This is a modified version of fallout 4’s engine. They never had to mass item track other than initial item ID’s to spawn some via console command.
---
Banning anyone who’s cheated in this game would delete like 60% of the games population anyone and probably the ones who play the most more or less, so that wouldn’t happen even if they could track the players.
---
This is how the game is for now, it could change eventually but for now this is what it is 
---
Welcome to the bog.
---
I assume a lot of people dupe on second accounts and dgaf if it gets banned. Beth might be able to track these through trade history, if they kept a log l.
---
But I don't think they will.
---
I think the condition increases with level.
---
But apart from that and legendary Stat aside, same gun, same perks, same damage
---
if it wasn't for seeing the Calibrated Shocks in a video on youtube I'd not believe they exist at this point.....haven't seen a single one, yet I've seen 3 Jetpacks.....
---
Bethesda claims they're working on it. It's been broken since yesterday. 
---
TSE prof should be on a 3 second cooldown to make it anything remotely balanced 
---
You must be skint...
---
The main issue with an RP server is that it's a troll/griefer magnet. Those people feast on despair, and what better way than to yell slurs into a $5 microphone and ruin any immersion
---
Awesome! I didn’t think of that tbh. Thanks for the info.
---
Not sure why someone has downvoted us but whatever, I guess 
---
I agree especially about the workshops. I became wanted that way because I didn't know the safe I was lockpicking belonged to a player who has claimed a workshop.
---
It’s not a lot of time lol i’m level 100, and i haven’t played the game for about a month, i was level 35 when the game was released, and that’s just from the BETA sessions. XP is easy
---
We're talking about a company that pulled the ESO servers offline within an hour of finding a dupping glitch. I honestly don't think they care.
---
Get marsupial, bird bones and speed demon mutations.
---
You will actually feel like you have been playing a crippled character before. 
---
Best way to get a lot supplies from PVP is to look for players standing at workshops. Fast travel there, wave, walk up and attempt to claim the workshop, and immediately attack them.
---
Not very nice, but you can get a lot of good stuff that way. 
---
Im glad im not the only one. I just recently tried to get in one of the silo's but it shows up as the red scanner?  Is it a glitch or bethesda sealed it for the moment of time.
---
People are just dicks to be dicks.  Especially prevalent on any gaming subreddit.
---
Don’t know about PC but on console I switch perspectives right before i land 
---
Make or get a legenday gun you want to use. Try get its level as close to your level as possible. It doesnt matter too much in early game. Max lvl weapons are 50. Also melee builds are op. 
---
Indeed, instigating is better than 2 shot! (I have one, it wrecks!)
---
Whitespring nuke zones give absurd amounts of exp.  I found myself leveling 5-6 levels for an hour or two in them.
---
As it WAS the holiday break, and I was enjoying it, I did whitespring nuke farming every day almost for those delicious legendary golf clubs.  Now I'm 176.  
---
it's clearly obvious that both the emotes and the silly skins are both a method trying to copy fortnite. They are trying to get more players, there is no shame in that. We will have battle royal too in the next year, it's perfectly fits the gameplay. Not trying to bash the game, they just want money
---
What about toxic soot flowers? It's an ingredient for something I can craft, but I've never seen it.
---
The safes don't "belong" to that player.  They belong to the workshop, but the game doesn't make that distinction after the workshop has been taken.
---
That's a negative, ghost rider
---
TL:DR I don’t play with female gamers unless I know them IRL cuz they will play the gender card if they think they can get free endgame gear out of it (despite the fact they couldn’t equip any armour on the frames)
---
I was playing with my mate, and I’m lvl 100+ he’s 75+. We are at our workshop at a nuked whitesprings repairing weapons and armour etc
---
These lvl 8-10s come up to us, 3 of them. One of them who’s a girl comes up and begs for free power armour sets. We tell her no and she needs to get some s. She accuses us of being sexist etc. Then some guy with an explosive shotgun (idk specifics) comes over to use our workshop. I’m fine with that It’s not affecting me. He has a 300 cap bounty and it was 100 about half an hour ago so I’m not gonna mess with him; anyway he comes over and asks what’s happening becuase from a perspective away, 2 high levels in power armour pointing guns at 3 low levels in Leather armour telling us to go away seems suspicious. I explained that she wants 3 free sets of power armour to explore the nuke zone and we are sexist for not giving it to her, I also explain that I set up this workshop for anyone in the nuke zone to have a small break outside. He simply says “your alright then I don’t see the problem”
---
Then she has a go at both of us for being bigots and mysoginistic and so on, so he shoots her and she goes down. Her mates walk by revive her and carry on with repairing. She shoots at him with a pistol. Now what happens when a lvl 8 shoots at a lvl 100 pvp professional? She dies, we leave her loot and do our own thing. She comes back, tries again, and this carries on until her mates get involved and also shoot at him. So at that point we are sitting there watching a level 100 absolutely ruin 3 newbies becuase they won’t give up, then apparently we are all sexist for not giving her armour, killing her, and insulting her.
---
Nope.  You need to memorize every plan you have ever used...
---
We've been asking for a solution to this since BETA.
---
I've noticed this recently and my loot has become crazy good. A few examples:
---
Explosive double barrel shotgun
---
2 shot gatling gun
---
Fire axe with 30% faster swing speed
---
Reporting the messages is probably her best bet. Xbox Live generally take harassment, especially if they contain threats, seriously and should take action against them.
---
It's a horrible situation for her to be in so I hope that it does get sorted out one way or another.
---
It is as if something had gone by mistake, because the cracks are sealed, maybe it is a detail in the future when we put an end to the threat of burns. 
---
Or stimpak
---
So.
---
Gary! haha Gaaary
---
Between holidays i took my and my GFs PS4s to my parents. In one day (+-8hours) my mum with my brother did level 10 and 12. They only done main quest to flatwoods and then killed 3grafon monsters. (it was fucking funny to look at PC players running around houses with dualshock controlers).
---
 If you are strugling with water/food/ammo go back to flatwoods do some events there, take workshop there. Dont rush to high level areas if you get screwed. 
---
As you level out of the newb levels, those players that are trying to be helpful and giving all their junk to newbs are still just helping the newbs. The strangers that seek you out next will not be looking to give you their junk, but to trick you in pvp in some way or just flat out grief you. Good luck!
---
Damage is damage on here, it's not like some other games where item level has a scaling aspect with it, other than higher level items will do more damage than a lower level counterpart 
---
(I.e. level 20 hunting rifle does a decent bit more damage than a level 1 hunting rifle, but that's just the damage number)
---
No, and it's a damn shame.
---
I've been solo 99% of the time on 76 but with another game I played long term, I always ran with women. They were always more mellow and that's what I look for in gaming. 
---
Get me on the basketball court in rl, then I can be a competitive dick. Just doesn't suit me in my living room. 
---
Why the hell are you here then?
---
Yeah, we know.
---
Bethesda just used the same assets from 4, hardly anything has changed.  Not saying this because i hate the game,  just saying it becaise it's true. 
---
I don't remember the vault number. I think it was the one with the guard shack out front.
---
I don’t play with women if I can help it becuase so many of them play the gender card for free gear that it’s just too much effort to deal with them
---
I’ve had a couple of really good encounters, this was probably the best though
---
There's only one version of the game, I don't think that each vault would have its own special skin when it was distributed to people with pip-boys or computers
---
Waiting and watching. Don't like it? Meh.
---
Well, at this point any half-measures are just wasted effort because the horse has already bolted... Got on a truck... jumped into an aeroplane hold and is now flying into another continent where it hopes to qualify as an astronaut and escape into the endless void that is interstellar space.
---
No, you've got to fix the problem at it's source (plug the dam) and then work out how to drain the lake to the levels you want.
---
Personally, [this is my preferred option](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/072/034/1275681680230.jpg).
---
Me too. Would kill for Armor piercing 3\* cultist blade or machete.
---
You need a new years resolution 😆
---
Last time we played together, my friend said "Can we not be violent this time? We dont really need CMF! (I consume ammo like a kid consumes candy after halloween)"
---
"He's already dead."
---
"Oh. Does he have any junk?"
---
I love how vague that is. Yikes. I've loved all the fallout games and have sunk a good 100+ hours in this game since beta so I will definitely play the new content, but my faith in it is pretty low after everything that's happening with this game.
---
I used a Gatling Plasma against a Scorchbeast once during the BOS quest
---
It broke when I had 63 rounds left. In the very first plasma core. 
---
Jesus. In general heavy weapons need a durability buff. They never seem to last more than 1 (or 2 if lucky) mags without breaking down in the middle of killing your target
---
&gt;tons of companies do this well without resorting to such cheap tactics as "if you have program X installed, you are guilty"
---
The cheat program has to be running at the same time as the game, simply having it installed isn't going to get anyone banned. Don't wanna get banned? Close your cheat programs prior to opening the game.
---
The codes never change right? You don’t have to go find each piece, just use the code from last week and every other week since launch. 
---
Negative 150 years old ish
---
ty!
---
Bigger badder communist robots
---
i see trend here, ty!
---
No, but it's even more annoying when you buy two lots of a plan that you already have. 
---
I don't know about #2 but #1 I speak frequently in game. I've never experienced any harrassment or even bad behavior from any player so far. I've never had "white knighting" or any problems. I've had a few low level male players ask for help or advice on certain aspects of the game. I've also received help when I struggled with learning the perk card system without any issues. Just two gamers talking to one another.
---
For the life of me I can't figure out where all these women find these harassing people. I've played every day in beta till now except Christmas. 
---
Level 170 270 hours under my belt. I leveled to 50 taking a bunch of workshops and defending them. 
---
Running through nuked whitesprings woth a tense rifle has been pretty lucrative as well. A group with inspirational shared I’ve seen 1200xp for one kill.
---
Cranberry foods, the mothman lighthouse event, mama dolces event all give xp enhancing buffs/food. Don’t forget to sleep in a bed for an extra +5xp
---
I'm melee but i put 6 points into perception to get tank killer, rifleman, expert riflemen and master rifleman and use a gauss rifle. ammo can be created with basic steel and lead, you get enough even without ammosmith. degrades reasonably slowly too, does heaps of damage so i use that for all air targets only
---
Move on.
---
How? You are lucky. I feel like I find them every other session when I play with her. I had a guy (AND THIS WAS BEAUTIFULLY RECORDED) trying to seduce me as a female character in a session at CMF.
---
I like to believe that MODUS talks about alien ships in orbit (instead of scorch beasts) when he says “wait, what are those...things” after you reestablish the connection with korvac-doom
---
Youre not a huge gamer, you dont put in the time to progress. Simple. If you want to level higher play the game more than you do.
---
There are two at whitesprings between the golf course and the clubhouse.  Giant white flowers.  
---
Wish there was a fix on consoles for this. Been annoying since day 1 of beta. 
---
A new vengeful mothman with his band of mutated underlings who all control different sectors of the map and you need to work together to shut their operations down.
---
Here are my few tips on leveling up real quick but it would require that you may need to go to areas where there are high levels enemies and maybe do a few events. A commenly well place for farming exp is the whitespring and on top of that if the place is nuke then a whole bunch of glowing ghouls will come up and they'll drop a ton of exp. Also if you can reach cranberry fog there are cranberrys and as well as diesead one in which you can cook to boost your exp by 2-5 %. Also sleep gives another 5% bonus of exp. 
---
Yeah, but why waste them
---
Boiled is not the same as boiling? 
---
Accidentally duping stored CAMP items is ENTIRELY different from duping weapons that are ridiculously hard to get though.  Accidentally duping a CAMP is just annoying for the person it happens too.  
---
Purposefully duping TSE weapons and nuka-colas and god knows what else so you have a leg up on everyone else, on the other hand, is harmful to the in-game economy (what little of it is left) and is exploiting the game to get ahead.  There is a HUGE difference in the effect on the game.  They are in fact "cheaters" and your post definitely either identifies you as one, or someone who wishes they had the items to dupe so they could be one.  
---
However, fact of the matter is, the game seems to have been shoddily made which ALLOWS for all of these bugs.  Couple that with Bethesda trying to reinvent the wheel on several of their mechanics that other MMO's have already done and worked a large amount of the kinks out.  I won't defend Bethesda for their shoddy game design, but the Dupers don't deserve anyones defense as well considering they ARE actively cheating.
---
WAT?!?!?! 
---
That's the one weapon I've been dreaming of since the start of the game.
---
I have an explosive double barrel that also does 10% to players but that's the closest I've got to it
---
You can progress faster even solo but my advice is not to rush it - play the game at your own pace and enjoy every moment.   Grinding and power leveling gets boring quick.
---
I have a question now you mention it.. Suddenly, for no reason I can think of the golf outfits stopped being stacked for me. Has this happened to anybody else? Super annoying to scroll thru 30 of the damn things. They used to stack. :(
---
Help?  They didn't even bother actually reading the post and rushed to assume I'm one of those people with dozens of unread plans in my note section.  Telling someone whose story explicitly beings with "I bought the plans, **used them**..." to use the plans is the opposite of being helpful.
---
Indeed
---
Cargobob Squarepants
---
That's... not true, I would venture to guess you've never launched a nuke yourself.
---
That’s not correct at all 😂
---
The nuke codes changed every Monday at 7pm EST, a community member of ours created a website specifically for cracking the codes each week. I believe it’s called NukaCrypt
---
You also agreed to block me and didn't :(
---
"almost everyone".... How do you know that? I don't have anything duped. Who are these "everyone" you speak of? 
---
I mean, casual players that doesn't go on forums for the game probably doesn't even know there is duping going on 
---
Very nice location description thank you
---
The Summerset Legendary effect is Anti-armour, it doesn’t do any extra damage directly because of the effect. (But will do more ACTUAL damage over an equal lvl 44 pistol or higher lvl due to the anti armour effect)
---
What is the level of the Summerset? That can cause a discrepancy.  (Post suggests 20)
---
However, increasing the lvl of the gun (Create) will increase the damage. Ex, Hinting Rifle goes up 5 Dam At each build level. 
---
Agreed, the queens has some pretty high burst melee attacks, it can be pretty difficult to run a low health build and not die in range of her melee. Even freezing her with a cryolater doesn’t stop her melee attack. 
---
Yes please do. 
---
You might want to rethink your stance. It's literally the difference between putting a sign on my backyard shed vs Amazon.

&gt;post demands.
---
It's be nice if there wasn't only 1 outfit in the entire game with any kind of bonus. I'm not a chick, but +1 perception is +1 perception.
---
The problem is, if outfits from the atom store had any kind of bonuses, it would go against the "cosmetic only" thing they said, and everyone would scream "pay to win!" And if they added outfits into the game that had any bonuses, then people would be less likely to buy stuff from the store, because that would mean paying money for an outfit that is weaker than ones you find in the game. So we end up with outfits are all purely cosmetic... Except for one dress, which for some reason, has +1 perception.
---
Saved
---
I would love to see it in first person. I'm on ps4 and my mute on my headset likes to act up so I'll be talking to myself and all of a sudden someone responds and I feel like an idiot. 
---
They put out an announcement that there would be different pvp servers. Just need to wait and see what they come up with. 
---
Its terrible..I bought calibrated shocks. Noticed that Uranium fever was up so I hope over hoping to get shielded underarmor..afterwords I noticed the mod was gone..apparently repairing the uranium extractors eats mods😣
---
I can't fathom this either: I'm sure it's my ignorance but I don't really know why people are getting so caught up on putting this game in a box. If you're an RPG fan, you can't play this because it's not a 'proper' RPG?!? Who gives a fuck and why???
---
They're as common in the Toxic Valley as normal Soot flowers are everywhere else.  Head up there and wander around, you'll find them easily.
---
Cool!  I was just thinking about this the last couple days.  I started doing some picking and vendor runs to get some cap revenue, stocking up on consumables, and cleaning up my stash.    I can't say I've bothered mapping anything out yet, just grabbing anything along my journey, but I do appreciate this, especially when actively hunting for specifics. 
---
They are cheating. Cheating is always bad. 
---
&gt;TSE is overrated.
---
Hard agree. I got my hands on a TSE Handmade and, while the damage is ridiculous, it's the most inaccurate gun I've ever used in a game. It'll miss literally every shot in V.A.T.S. unless it's a crit.
---
can you please change color of starlight berries? two most important things here are firecaps and starlight berries, and i can't see any difference between rhodo and berries colors
---
Still broken ?
---
Yeah, it's definitely sapped any desire I may have had to launch any other nukes after that.
---
This isn't a subscription game though.  Once someone buys the game that's it outside of the occasional Atom purchase but, imo, you earn atoms at such a rate that unless there's a limited time item you really want you don't need to purchase any at all.  I can't believe they're making too much money from that.
---
i remember people complaining about that with ESO. what about moderators or bots that patrol and suspend the accounts of offenders? or, report that person. for example, I play on xbox. I've got friends banned from multiplayer or social activity for offensive shit they've said and done on NBA 2K19. if a sports game can handle punishing trolls, Fallout certainly xan

I can sell you the scaly skin serum or 2000 caps

gathering dirty water from rivers or lakes is faster, pop a rad-x, spam the collect button for minute and you end up with 100+ dirty water.   
---
Most ideas I've seen to fix duping would get some innocent people as well. I say instead of bans, just make people over 5k unable to walk. My idea for PvP is to build an on/off switch in your camp. You wouldn't want it on the pip boy because people would get a kill then turn it off. You also wouldnt be able to fast travel or move camp with PvP on. The people with it on show up as a different color on the map. Maybe blue cause red and white already stand for something. 
---
I'm thinking caps reward for PvP kills. 
---
The call him “Dogg”
---
I feel like it can be even more enjoyable solo, just doing your own thing and coming across a potential friend or foe before continuing on after whatever may happen. It’s kinda like Destiny, just seeing random people who might help you out and then move along 
---
After playing since beta theres only so many things you can meaningfully do inside that hyper limited budget though, particularly with the inability for the base to survive against players or scorch beasts etc even with most of its budget being hardened walls and missile launchers.
---
That's going to be making their team work even harder on a problem that they avoid by not having RP servers, it's been a problem on WoW forever as well.
---
Of course I'd be hopeful that sometime down the line after significant stability improvements that we could have dedicated RP servers or something of the like, but for now it's not feasible.
---
More of a request. Thank you for the feedback.

Whatever the fuck is in the bottom of the Bug Maw. Shits creepy.

Radstag for carry weight!!! 
---
The Somerset is level 5, I got it following the main quest when you first leave the vault. I know about the Legendary effect that's why I'm saying effects aside. I just wanted to know if there was a difference between a level 1 point of damage and a level 50 point of damage. Anyway thank you for your reply. I'll edit the OP to reflect it's level. 
---
You did say "can we".
---
Try the Hornwright Summer Villa (one of the big houses on the east shore of the dried-up lake near Charleston) in the back garden there's a greenhouse that I 'think' has gourds in it (corn certainly).
---
And if you had won against them you would be crowing and strutting around. Quit being salty.
---
You forgot the “until proven otherwise” of the saying 
---
Ehm, not even remotely true. They can ban people for pretty much any reason. They provide the service, they have the right to cut you off from it.
---
The law has no real part in it, at all. 
---
For sure, nobody can give me what I really want: a 24 hour orgasm

Works on console too. That first sip always gives me dysentry though. Spent nearly an hour trying to find ingredients for a disease cure yesterday, I'd already recovered by the time I found them.
---
So still down, better to know before I head in
---
I am playing since beta and am lvl116. Foto my idea i play alot of fo. Have a 40hour work week and a girlfriend. But some players have used XP glitches and are lvl 200/300 even saw a lvl500+ Just play the game and make sure to lvl your special acording to your build.
---
Cycle to the right on the selection, see if any are unlocked. I know quite a few of my build options were still showing locked after getting the plans until I actually built them
---
I'm just salty about the caps 
---
I have a vampiric super sledge that still one-shots most everything.
---
TSE weapons are way too powerful if they are causing such problems. Granted if TSE gets nerfex, something else will take its place but Bethesda really needs to understand they've created a multiplayer game which needs to be balanced as such.
---
To copy and paste a lot of the mechanics from FO4 and think that's a job well done is irresponsible at best and incompetent at worst.
---
Yeah, explosive boomstick is the way to go now that they've allegedly fixed it.  we'll see once nukes are usable again
---
That's been a bug since fallout 4, maybe use a switch and just turn off and on. Not sure if there ever was a fix.
---
Doesn't apply to stash boxes, they're single item categories.
---
Got any others?
---
oh well, then work harder. for a franchise as big as Bethesda, and a game with as many complaints and negative reviews as Fallout 76, the team working too hard is definitely not an excuse that should fly with anyone, to make anything happen.
---
The motivation for Bethesda to work on having dedicated RP servers is, like you said down the line, somebody will have a game with those type of servers. its either gonna be Bethesda, or a competitor.
---
more with grape mentats
---
You can grow gourds. But I don't think pumpkins or melons. Come to think of it, I've not tried to grow melons.
---
(Did you mean Raleigh's Bunker?)
---
This is a pretty good list, but you've missed one of the main things I use food for, and that is stat boosts. I believe it is mole rat chunks that gives +1 Strength, which increases melee damage and carry weight. I will often combine a +% melee damage with the strength foods and they seem to stack. Sweet Rolls increase Charisma by +3 and this will boost your selling prices at vendors and lower the costs. I also want to point out that the three sugar bombs for the sweet roll must be irradiated sugar bombs. The boxes will be damaged. The pristine sugar bombs cannot be used in the recipe. Finally, there are a lot of foods that just suck up resources for little to no benefit... the scorchbeast stew for instance takes up one of each type of scorchbeast drop (brain, lung, etc.) and some meat and it barely does more than what you would get by just frying up a single piece.
---
Thats because stealth + VATS is easy mode low skill and totally broken. Power armour also has very little use in pvp. Now try that on my -damage/player damage armour and the result won't be quite the same. ;)
---
You can also buy something and reset them. When I see a zero I will buy the cheapest item they have. If nothing happens then someone else has cleaned the vendor out.
---
Doesn’t a musical work’s cc disappear after 70 years though ? Please let me know , if it does they could play anything in the 40’s for free.
---
As my other posts stated, he wasn't doing any glitches and was only playing the game naturally. The loss of everything in his inventory happened after he was disconnected from the server.

There is a bunch in the basement of the vault-tec agricultural research place just Southwest of flatwoods.  At least 5 plus a bunch of waste acid and fertilizer.

I had 62 straight jackets in my stash.  I feel your pain.  It changed a while ago, though.
---
Yes it is called NukaCrypt. He posts the decrypted codes once they are solved and has a tool that you can put the revealed letters from the WS bunker into and it gives you all the possible combos. But each attempt requires it's own nuclear keycard so it's better to wait for the fully solved code.
---
I've encountered enemies underground, the only thing that DID work for me was molotovs. Might be worth a shot? 
---
Some people enjoy other aspects of the game aside from farming &amp; duping.
---
That’s because super mutants are batshit crazy and always have a screw loose 
---
Plenty of games have them, and they're always iffy. Saying that they should work harder means that you don't have much of an idea of how much work maintaining a huge online game is in the first place, it's not a couple of lines of html that you probably learned in high school.
---
This is another 'easy fix for dupers' post for Karma.

Change my mind

That's Bethesda for ya ahah thank for the info

Are vendors the only real place to get corn to replant? I haven't seen any in the wild.

How?

One comment would have been enough. You're just beig an ass by self promoting in Every. Single. Comment thread.

Thats a epic shotty.  The only explosive ive found so far is a 2 star quad laser rifle. I cant even make it through a mag before it breaks. Really hope Bethesda fixes the laser weapons durability.

One spawned on me and a friend during a quest. Killed it and got nothing special.

Unfortunately I collect all sorts of fresh ingredients to use at some point, then forget about them till they spoil. However, I recently discovered that you can smelt spoiled food in the chemistry station and turn it into fertilizer. So you win some; lose some.
---
No others. I found awhile back the plan to craft scaly skin serum so I made a few to sell them.
---
Probably because "feminism" has become tainted by the legions of 3rd wave feminists who continue to carry a torch for non-issues like the "wage gap" and "rape culture" while simultaneously vilifying all men and even suggesting that men should be removed and replaced by women, in spite of the fact that their positions were obtained through merit, rather than some perceived patriarchal conspiracy. 
---
Just requested you! 
---
I feel like I'd get punished for something that was not my fault.. I don't feel like starting over again..
---
They've said multiple times that they don't recommend using mods because they trigger the automated third party detector.
---
Everything you encountered was automated, so it could care less if you are loyal or malignant.
---
I don't know if you bought the correct plans or not but I had the same thing happen with the lamps plan. I bought it, used it, and disconnected. When I logged back in couldn't build any lamps (still can't!). It's almost like the server stopped responding, and therefore saving, before the disconnect even though you could move your character. I've lost weapons &amp; items (nothing good) that I got seconds before a complete game freeze or disconnect. When I bought the lamps I lost the caps though, I didn't get those back. 
---
You took some behemoth his stomp, he can only tippy toe now 
---
Return it before he gets sad ;(
---
(Mission marker added) 
---
People will do taht regardless.. No idea how stopping duping would help. Before TSE it was melee people one shotting everything. Just bring a tesla gun and tag everything quick.
---
Never mentioned banning in my comment but yeah I've looked into it a bit more in that area. I really wish they could keep track but since they can't the least they could do is just patch the exploit. 
---
I see your point, I dont care about Karma... however its true that this post could be seen as part of the problem it is about. I was scrolling through to find some entertaining posts while eating breakfast and noticed that posts about dupe fixes were wildly disproportionate to any other type of post. I made this post because it is how I really feel and felt the need to make it known. I respect your view of it but it isn't the case.
---
Absolutely a no from me on the PvP part.
---
This isn't a pvp game. Nowhere near any resemblance of it being balanced enough.
---
This is a co-op game with PvP being optional. I don't want to be restricted to certain areas because of your idea.
---
Pvp servers are coming soon. Go shoot each other to your hearts desire on those servers.
---
Thanks for this post.   
---
"Easy fixes to dupers" discussions sound like "how to make your penis bigger". Pointless
---
Tommy Lee Jones wouldn't be caught dead playing this shit.
---
I only move it or server hop.  Doesn't cost me anything to hop and I have never once repaired anything on my base.  I have moved it a few times to lesser known spawn locations in Whitesprings and had the same thing happen, yeah it costs me caps but they aren't hard to get.  Leveling from 22 - 50 on ghouls solo with a chainsaw at Whitesprings a few days ago netted me 1500 caps in 4ish hours.  On top of having 5 characters over level 50 that can clean out the caps on all faction vendors daily and it's no big deal.  
---
Why is this ok? 
---
I was roaming around Flatwoods out of boredom today and saw Grahm walking towards it from the Overseers camp. Figuring that there are newbies there I ended up pulling out my .50 Cal LMG and slowly walking alongside him for protection and he did get shot at by some low level anyway lol. 
---
Wow thanks, I've ditched so much stuff with out checking. That changes today!
---
That has happened to me. But if you log out and come back it should be fixed. 
---
You’re right! But then the vendors run out of caps and you’re still over-encumbered and can’t fast travel to any more vendors...
---
In game? *No*
---
On paper? *Yes*
---
Lol. This is pretty accurate.
---
Because the mods you used weren't official or endorsed by the game. This will happen on a whole lot of online games if you try it. Always do research before nodding anything.
---
I’m looking to complete this weekly challenge too! My ign is ariyx, feel free to add me. Gonna bring the military fatigue over, hopefully it counts as a military outfit. I’ll be on in maybe around 4 or 6 hrs time, let me know when you’re online then! 
---
No mods means no mods, no matter how seemingly benign they may be.  You violated the TOS...period.  Write the the essay and acknowledge that outside apps can destabilize the game and lead to unintended consequences. 
---
meh
---
Hahah! Funnnnny Joke!
---
They've never stacked for me
---
Sorry must have missed that info. With the large volume of posts on the reddit it’s easy to miss important info.
---
You literally get a warning saying pvp will be enabled when you claim workshops 
---
Well maybe you haven’t said banning but just about anyone with an “easy dupe fix” likes to throw in the idea that banning them is even possible 
---
Thanks! Did you count the firecaps? I am getting tired of only making a few disease cures at a time and this map will really help me out.
---
Generally, for published works created after January 1, 1978, copyright extends for 70 years beyond the life of the author. If there is more than one author, the copyright usually extends to 70 years from the death of the last living author.
---
When musicians create work for corporations or limited liability companies, this is considered "work for hire," and the corporations or limited liability companies are the owners of the copyright for 95 years from its first publication or for 120 years from the year of its creation, whichever expires first. 
---
Sorting by stack weight would be nice.  I'd also like to just see more information about weights in general.  Total stack weight, total category weight, weight before/after perks (since storage doesn't use perks).  I spend a lotta time just trying to find whatever is taking up space.  It's often junk or food, but at a glance it's unclear just how much everything weighs, and how much stash they'll use up if perks are affecting it.
---
And you don't even get your ammo back, so it's all gone to waste.
---
Perhaps we killed the queen, so most fissure sights are closing. Of course prime still exists to nuke queen cause you can't just cut content, but maybe some other world wide stuff will happen instead, now that other vaults are opening.
---
Giant evil plants?
---
Aliens?
---
Communist robot armada?
---
&gt;Fallout knows it's a game 
---
Wasn't there a direct reference to that back in 2 or tactics? (i forget, been at least a decade since i last played the OG fallouts)
---
"git er done" - the paying customer
---
&gt; but I'm in second semester with no industry experience and already had rearlational dætabases 101, so I'm am kind of an expert
---
&gt; also let me draw you this scheme I think BGS uses, which also persist reference_id, because that's totally not just a client-side/game-engine thing
---
It just works.
---
Can confirm, I've came across a few already down and looted nuclear cards from them.
---
How much budget do they take compared to normal floors?
---
if the holotapes are exciting to you then im sure picture books with large font are your thing.
---
Are you a PC gamer? Because it sounds like your not. 
---
like of a rad-x disable it..
---
go to lucky mine, and find the hidden creature. Maybe that's what Big Maw or something similar 
---
I'm not sure if stuff released to public domain is useable for commercial work, and it depends on if the original copyright holder (or their estate if they have died) chooses to renew the copyright iirc (don't quote me on that though, i'm about as much a solicitor as Lawyer Morty)
---
I know that this is satirical but it makes me sad that for a minute I thought it was serious... because that's how dumb some of these posts are.
---
if u have not 2-3 full legandary set  ur a pretty low player. not need duping just kill legandary oponents.
---
There is DJ radio mod in Nexus Mods [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/126](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/126)
---
I am just here to witness the Trainwreck from the best seats - the passenger seats right in the middle 
---
If it gets better it’s all nice and I get a online game that supports modding (remains to be seen soon if Bethesda will go back on its word pre-release) 
---
If it doesn’t get better or even worse, I had some laughs out of fallout76 and was part of the shit storm 
---
Buy one or two for me?:P
---
It's rare in terms of encounters .. though I've run into him only a handful of times.
---
White springs robots ignore him if you're fighting him, unlike EVERY other monster. Neat little tidbit if you didn't know and just happen to run into him there.
---
His aoe can fuck over turrets &gt;.&lt;. He's not hard once you've got decent gear, but if you're on a low alt. Just .. be prepared to die and loose your stuff, lol.
---
I've played PC since Morrowind came out, and modded most single player games I've ever played, as well as the helpful UI mods in WoW (Since WiW both allows and encourages mods due to server stability and over a decade of figuring out how to see if an add-on is malicious or not).
---
From what I noticed, it barely affected the budget. Especially in comparison to a floor/foundation. The main reason I had to try something else was because I physically couldn't get a foundation inside the building.
---
I understand this, just pointing it out 
---
*Dear Bethesda,
---
I think I know more than you and modified your game violating TOS. You banning me hurts my ego so I'm bitching on reddit*
---
Fixed it.
---
You laugh but in one of the holotapes it says that people are drinking unboiled water because it tastes better 
---
I'm thinking when/if the scorched goes away, that factions will start to move in. That's really what I'm hoping for. Maybe not fully gone away but dwindled to the point where it's not exterminating all life 
---
Technically it is. It’s just the one player killing the same player. 
---
Shoot out an engine. Slows it down. Shoot out two, it comes to a stop. Easy and works every time. 
---
Yeah, now lets make post about fix duping. Do you want make one first, or should i?
---
Do quests, build a fancy new camp on a cliffside or on a lake, take some pictures, find a friend, the wasteland has so many opportunities!
---
Outer Worlds isn’t open world though.
---
Is duping an issue on consoles too?
---
Looks like many are half-baked and static labels. For example, the Poseidon Power plant lists Water\[8\] and Power Core\[3\] yet they nerfed Power Core to 1/hr and there is a small water pond at the edge of the buildable region where you can put an industrial water purifier of 60/hr. 
---
The Charleston landfill has Water\[8\] and there is usually a pre-built industrial water purifier on top of it. 
---
I've built 5 x 12/h water purifiers on Water\[5\] and I only got 12/h. I read that you have multiple purifiers, they slow each other down which could be a bug or intentional (so you don't build 20 of them to get hundreds of water per hour).
---
I think there were originally going to separate storage containers. The little white signs would have been perfect for leveling the contents of different boxes. 
---
44.37% full sentinel 
---
At that point I was probably too low level to take him on, I’d have a crack now though
---
You're joking right? Bethesda needs modders to keep their games going. They've coasted on the backs of modders for years. Change my mind. 
---
"waste" them? I don't know how you play the game but i have 100+ all the time in my inventory so using a chem to take some water from a lake shouldn't be a big deal to anyone.
---
I have "Snallygaster Spit Attack Explosion" in my inventory. It sells for -1 caps and I can view the green spit ball when pressing X (PC). 
---
They didn’t say that. They said there would be “a new PvP mode”. That could be different servers but it also could be an event on the existing servers or perhaps a battle arena-type area on the existing servers. Who knows.
---
Did you find the hidden creature because I couldn't find anything other than notes. 
---
You should pretty much ditch low level legendaries when you start to outlevel it by a at least 10 levels
---
Do you need to keep animal friend on after they're tamed?
---
Also:
---
While ultracite ammo also requires Flux and ultracite, crafting it will produce more ammo than the normal version (per single craft).
---
This means that you will need less of the normal materials like lead and gunpowder to make your ammo.
---
I very much prefer that. 
---
Unless you use bloody power armour which doesn't make use of fist weapons. Ree.
---
It intrigues me how they are going to do with the missiles. when they begin to appear new settlements, if they add in the future. I do not think they put so many safe areas 
---
I'm level 97, started a new character after the BETA. I do play with friends and that a good way to save ammo and maintain your weapons. More people shooting means less shooting for you. Also melee is really good in this game even without a melee build. Get a Death Tambo doesnt weigh much and does decent damage. For xp run events like Uranium Fever near Whitesprings or Line in the Sand at Fort Definace. At UF you can get 3 star legendaries by killing waves of mole miners and LitS let's you murder a couple of scorchbeasts plus the adds it spawns in for each wave. As others have said dropping nukes, particularly on Whitesprings can net  you a ton of xp. *pro tip* Enable Pacifist mode in game settings and use Molotovs. It has a wide radius and will damage more enemies, you'll get more xp and save ammo since a lot of people are usually competing for kills. 
---
Which makes sense. But there's quite a bit of evidence to suggest something much more sinister is the explanation.
---
I'm really interested in getting something like this working myself. There are few maps around but none showing things like this. I'd also love one that maps mob spawning etc.
---
Every platform has duping.
---
Yeah I love my Recon Pistol build. Thing surprised me by how fast I could pick off foes. I recommend Hair Trigger + Recon Scope forsure, accompanied by Perks like Gunslinger.
---
&gt; But it looks like one, smells like one and in some parts plays like one.
---
How? Fallout 76 has far more in common with Borderlands than Elder Scrolls Online. Never heard anyone call Borderlands an MMO, despite having character classes (even team healing), events that can be done together, voice chat, text chat, friends list, randomly generated loot and a big open world.
---
I just hunt materials. Is fun.

the entrance is hidden by those plants

---
lmfao non-issues
---
I have seen it, it's interesting. Try watching a youtube video that talks about it, the caves are hard to explain using words. I saw it in a video while looking for Easter eggs. 
---
Want to point out they may not be broken or bugged. It might be hinting at upcoming content. 
---
This. I got about ten-fifteen away and crippled the cargobot with a shotgun.
---
[Um, yeah, not bad at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCEQpX27S_A&amp;t=799s)
---
Can use diluted without turning off mutations..
---
I would say OP’s sense of humility in ignorance about fixing the problem as opposed to talking out of your ass about a game engine, etc. 
---
Hey OP, I'm interested how you got the data for this? Did you actually trudge around the world hunting them?
---
Or I'm assuming you found a way to extract them?
---
I made a playlist that I am adding locations to in order to quickly grab them on the go.  Your best bet is to tag them in your junk and grab them everywhere you go but these are great locations for people who like to dedicated farm certain items.  Hope this helps and have fun in the wasteland!

---
It’s helpful to rebuild holes or gaps in workshops as well - FYI - it’s my go to when repairing the hole in the Munitions factory office and walkway to the workstation above the ammunition resource generator ( I’m a bit OCD ) lol 
---
How? I don't know. I just play. I don't see myself as a female gamer. Just a gamer. I would say maybe it's the platform but I play on PS4 which I'd think would have more younger players less likely to own gaming PC's. Everyone I've met has been normal. Gamers playing a game.
---
I don't give any weapons, armor or aid items to low levels, but I do give them plans and recipes. But then I also don't really just give away late game stuff like fusion generator plans or something like that, because they might want to earn them for themselves later.
---
Vendor cap limits. Character cap limits. 
---
Sounds like a bit of regulation to me. 
---
Also, it can't be both "omg things are so cheap now" and "omg new players are paying inflated prices" when the going rates on items listed here is LOWER than vendor price. 
---
Yeah, I've seen it. The thing in the Big Maw looks bigger to me, idk. We need something big to kill that doesnt screech and cloud my screen the whole time.
---
They said they’ll be releasing servers for people that want to use mods.  You’re playing an online game and they aren’t allowed.  
---
No one needs to change your mind, you need to learn to play by the rules.  
---
I believe it is level 50 but I will have to check it only explodes on the first contact and shoots a little ball that explodes not a arc of electricity 
---
I think it is you that needs to calm down. Every post I've seen about leaving amounts to, 'I will be back when Bethesda puts more to do into the game.' Not everyone is interested in dailies or grinding items that will be trivialized by new content, or roleplaying to fill the cop-out NPC gap. Bethesda needs to take notice that for some of their players there really isn't enough to do. 
---
I was playing with it and if you are pressing R2 on PS4 instead of holding, it shoots faster.
---
I always try to give lower levels player stuff they can use or near it. Mostly AID stuff
---
Sounds good :)
---
Count out how many of those games were multiplayer, with the server being on their end trying to make the game fair for all players by blocking third party apps/mods which can create an unfair advantage.
---
Stop trying to compare it to these vast single player games where they could care less what you do to the client since they aren't hosting the server and you're playing along.
---
If you were a loyal fan of Bethesda you have known ahead of time that ANY mods could lead to a ban... you tried to break the rules and got banned? Seems like everythings working as it should be to me 
---
My problem is that I did all the quests and lore on my first character while leveling up. Now it's just trying to go through it all again while noticing the bugs. Only reason I'm making a new character is to get all the quest reward legendaries as lvl 45/50 since they can't be upgraded like the MoM gear. Sure would be nice if they could be though. 
---
Knowing my luck, I’ll get a golf club with 25% faster reload... *sigh* 
---
You forgot the ancient excel called "note it down on paper" but Im team excel too
---
ah ok, i couldn't remember. 
---
(RT for Xbox)
---
Quick answer non nuked whitesprings and then adventuring out after clearing it from log in, do some events. Just hit 95 last night and only play casually, found alot of locations and do events from time to time but I try and stay away from main missions for the time being. From what I understand you can get a fair amount of xp but the unique items scale to your lvl so it's a safe bet to wait until you hit 50 before you start them. 
---
It's a vault designed to keep people alive in the event of a nuclear war.
---
As mentioned by others. 50 Damage is 50 Damage. The difference is probably the receiver on the Special.  
---
They just need to put an "indoors don't rain here" trigger on the interior, which iirc they built a long time ago?
---
This should be fixable by editing the prefab (I'm assuming you're in camp mode)
---
It's funny because you just showed up to my level 11 friend and proceed to destroy everything we built for him after we left, then you hopped servers after we started showing back up. what's even better is that there is video to prove it.
---
&gt; TL:DR 
---
I believe it depends on the workshop. Converted Munitions factory can take between 2-3 minutes (assumingly because they want to give you time to hook up the factory/resources), while for exaple Tyler County Dirt Track can trigger only 30 seconds after taking the workshop.
---
Fake
---
What about it 
---
I love my 10mm, I'm trying like a sob to find a 2 shot.... If i sneak attack a level 68 super mutant i can take him down with like 10 rds with the right perks running.
---
There are no "increased quality" texture mods available. Bull
---
With broken pvp you could probably one-shot someone with them. Pew pee.
---
This is excellent. I just wish I could give out sweet rolls and soups without them spoiling in an hour.
---
'legendary enemy has mutated'
---
Customer support are not in the dev team! They are two separate entities within the same company how do none of you understand that 
---
I helped a level 14 build a base by the water. built him a fusion generator and water purifier.  also set up gargan door. while I was building it he was building a 3 story house I said bro you dont need all that lmao..
---
Only sometimes, I noticed some buildings not only have working exterior roofs that block rain, they also make that satisfying "rain tapping on a sheet metal roof" sound. I gotta say, if nothing else, the sound design in this game is phenomenal.
---
I think the queen will still be triggerable since there's a console side achievement with completing scorched earth but I'm mostly just excited to see some new content soon. 
---
I also am the proud owner of "snallygaster spit explosion attack" whi ch also costs the minimum integer.
---
I tried selling it to a vendor but the prices shows as 0 and it can't be sold.
---
One of us is trying to be helpful one of us is a dick, (hint you are the second)
---
I'm not op so why are you directing this at me... I only had a suggestion. 
---
If you have a pair of headphones with an adapter (a cord plugging into another cord) you can actually avoid this bug. As long as the cord is plugged into the jack you can disconnect and reconnect the headphones at the adapter without losing in-game sound.
---
The compass through me off completely last night. I was trying to walk to a fissure site without having to place a marker (OMG HOW COULD I!?) and before I knew it i was going the complete opposite way. Small chance for user error but still smells fishy.
---
You can report the video to Youtube, but it's not in violation of any community standards, unfortunately :(  You could report it to Bethesda via a ticket as well.  I just don't think there's much Bethesda could do either.
---
Never thought to use em like that, with how finicky some of the object placement is it's a shame we don't have flat wooden panels we can place over things like that :&lt;
---
I keep my holotapes in my stash and my game almost exclusively crashes when I'm moving stuff around. You may have just alleviated much of my stress, gonna dump these later and see if that fixes it.
---
Theres a PS4 community that I joined for queen fights that has now turned into those mmo ppl selling caps/guns for cash. GOTY!!
---
I got my corn from a garden plot west of Morgantown airport (in the area that looks like a settlement with shacks and whatnot, north east of the train station.)  I’ve seen them at some of the farms too. I believe Cobbleton farm north of vault 76 has corn, as does one of the farms SW of vault 76 (next to Billings homestead.)
---
I can't say I understand the negative skew this game receives.  Sure, it's not perfect, but it's minimally on par with any other Fallout game.  I think more of the gripe revolves around the idea that the game isn't what everyone was dreaming it would be.  It's not something any developer can do.  You simply will never please everyone.  Every time I play it I appreciate the details more and more.  Bethesda did put a lot of work into this game, and it's quite apparent.  I do think the inability to mod the game is a huge departure for most people.  I've commonly played Fallout games with north of 100 mods running for a wide array of visual, QOL, and content changes.  This is the first Fallout that removes a chunk of user control in that fashion, and that's no fun.  There are still mods, but there's now a lot less the community can do to the game to really shape it to their liking.  They're not relying completely on Bethesda to evolve the game...hopefully in a desirable way for them.  In the long run, we'll see how it goes.  I think we all have our wishlists of what we dreamed FO76 would be.  For many, it's not what we wished, and I think that's where a lot of the disappointment and negative feedback has come from.  Everyone wants it to be something different in a thousand different directions that can not fathomly cohabitate.  Bethesda has a game model, and it works.  It feels well developed, although perhaps not as adventurous or groundbreaking as some may have hoped.  The way I view it is This is Bethesda's first attempt at the online genre, so future iterations will simply get better.  FO76 will evolve some, but it's the next game and the game after that which may be truly interesting and something special.  FO76 is what it is, and for the thing it is, it's pretty decent and certainly not worth the negative press it's receiving.
---
I think it's usually somewhere around 1k these days
---
I'll give you 100 caps for a mutation serum. I want Eagle Eyes.
---
thank you but i kn ow all of the robot mods just need the item to mod, be surprised how hard it is to get something somewhat usable in the style you prefer :P
---
Others have said it, I'll just add mine for more clarification. Damage is damage in terms of points (60 dam on a level 5 = 60 dam on a level 20 or even 50 for that matter). But range also plays a factor, as does fire rate and all that good stuff. But weapon level has no additional benefit in terms of attributed values.
---
So I checked nuka crypt and it just says "bugged". Came here for more info. Nuke silos are broken this week? Cuz I got a tse .44 with +1 perception last night and need 2 violet flux to put a prime receiver on it. Consider me butt hurt
---
Don’t bother. Seriously the firecaps are seasonal or something. They’re harder to find than hens teeth. 
---
Get the Pharma Farma perk card under luck. When you search chem boxes, med boxes or mirrors you a given the option to search. At one point I had 16 disease cures. 
---
In the secret Chinese bunker a terminal mentions it wasneverdelivered to Appalachia.

Pets attack other players on sight, as far as I know.
---
I have to help myself before I help anyone else. This is the wasteland people
---
Oh well he got carried away lol, i know i did at first. 
---
Theres allegedly a hotfix to remedy the issue coming today.  Also what system are you on? i think i have a couple violet flux sitting around
---
Where do you store the things you want to sell? 
---
-&gt; remove stash limit first
---
Fair enough !
---
The fact that there are no effects does to me say that it was rushed development.
---
Well it started because you said they could track item qauntity, they know item ID’s but they don’t have the capability to restore items to specific players or deal with specific inventories. Therefore there’s no way to remove said items even if they *could* track them as specifically as everyone wants 
---
They’d never be able to trace down every individual dupped item to delete it, thatd be the equivalent of picking through a pile of dirt and separating grains of sand. The damage js done.
---
No I haven’t. 
---
it's not?! with the house it's totally out of budget oO wth
---
Now that's intreting.
---
I said bro when your budget gets higher do it lol.  I was trying to build him a farm as well I said what's more important food or 3 story house lol
---
that's a lootttt of faith to put into a company that couldnt source canvas
---
This could be pretty funny...
---
One of the reasons I like making a base near the secret pond at marigold pavilion is because of the blackberries. Boil water from the pond and make blackberry juice. Couple that with the perk card that quenches thirst and just a few drinks will hold you forever. Plus, radstag spawn under it.

It’s not against the rules or guidelines for a youtuber to accept either sponsorships (company pays them to speak about them in their videos) or to simply state the site. Perfectly allowed. So, reporting it would be more harm than good; it would be a false report. 
---
Ive seen plenty of 30 second sponsored segments for the site on many different f76 videos. As much as I agree it’s a bad site, it’s perfectly legal to run as is, and I can’t control what a YouTuber decides to sponsor. They have the right to do that. 
---
There's s glitch that duplicated camp items, so he had a bunch of copies of everything he had built (his camp is way over budget and he can't build anything new unless he deletes it down to be under budget)
---
sounds like irl
---
I think theres a blueprint glitch, or did they fix that 
---
To much goofy stuff in the Atom shop, they are trying to rip-off Fortnite (all the game companies want a piece of that $2+ million a day), but all the kids playing that aren't playing this game (plus it is rated T, while this game is M). So, why bother trying to sell to a non-existent audience?
---
Well, good for you. Keep it going and please make sure to update us all after the honeymoon phase wears off and you start to see all the flaws/encounter bugs.
---
It almost makes me want to drop on a nuke on the forest...
---
First I’d settle for windows with actual glass in them. You can/should still have the broken ones available, just give us a choice. 
---
Google Docs
---
I understand not locking the plans out in case you want to buy one for a friend, but they should have a little asterisk or something to indicate that you already know the item.
---
Verified this effect myself last week while farming bots in Watago ... all the TSE weapons actually decrease loot value. I equip a lower Stat weapon and tank damage until they regen and THEN 1 shot them... I have even received 2 star gear from 1 star enemies this way. Got my up vote for spreading the good news. Don't be afraid to stare a legendary in the eye and say "Bring it biatch." The rewards are worth it.
---
It doesnt actually enable PVP (disable pacifist) it just says that other players may engage with you in PVP to contest the workshop.
---
they do say " Thank you for your patience ", so that means it will be fixed in the net patch, mid. january, 
---
as long as that doesn't hit another short holiday , lol
---
Go to the Abandoned Bog Town workshop in Cranberry Bog, head to the rooftop and hop in the elevator shaft. The office in there has tons of typewriters, almost one per table, and some globes on the lockers. 
---
Other places I’d recommend are Astronomy Research Center, Sugar Grove and military wing in the Enclave bunker. I was trying to craft my first excavator PA but was super low on screws, I went through all these places and that got me enough screws to craft the entire suit! 
---
Definitely a choosing beggar post 
---
Uh and what about your teachers?
---
I've definitely had the +10 from the 'toad overwrite my +20 from the 'stag. All you get from that is *salt.*
---
I had a server go down while I was doing one of the main quest lines, the progress I made on it was lost and can’t be re done. Bethesda support said make a new character, I kept playing for a few weeks and then gave up on it. You’ve probably been screwed by stability.
---
Use the melee 2 farm weaker nobs6for shells and kill queen with shotgun. That's what im doing 
---
There is a cabinet in the stash, and a separate, different cabinet in the tables section. Unfortunately I don’t think they are the same plan, OR any way to tell which is which when buying them from my experience.
---
a ton of weapons are under the dps of a properly set up M2. gatling is for efficiency, not "lul muh dps". even though gatling is slower its still considered top tier since its per shot value is high enough to offset.
---
its like comparing a nascar to a prius, yeah the nascar will finish first but the prius will take you farther on the same amount of fuel. 
---
A 15 strength unarmed melee build here. Having 8 perks for shit breaking in my inventory is awful, not to mention that perks like bloody mess, action boy, class freak, are absolutely meta and REQUIRE you to have at least 9-8 agility and luck.
---
A lot of perks like bloody mess would do better in a different perk tree that doesn’t rely on special.
---
I have two theories:
---
-  there were two many nukes shot on Whitesprings and now the Silos are empty 
---
- finally something was bugged by Y2K
---
Ha nice
---
Exactly, I'll believe this game crashes often when it actually does.
---
Pretty sure he came around lol
---
I'm not exactly a high level, 26 or 27, but I got there in just a few days by wandering around the forest and exploring every spot that was unamrked on my map. I'd scav what I could, kill enemies, and participate in events I wandered into. I ended up almost a 20 before even visiting the responders in morgantown.
---
Selling in-game items and currency for real world money is against ToS and against the law, a ways away from "perfectly legal".
---
no point, if you go to the "status" room in the bunker, it will show you that the silos are in "error" even the assaulting tron says so there :)
---
An alternative to 3 would be installing unused weight perk cards to the stash.  You're gonna wind up with duplicates before you even hit 50,  being able to install those into something so they're not wasted would be kinda neat.  Then you'd get that effect, and no weirdness with the stash if you stop using them on your character.
---
Maybe the stash could have a limited perk capacity, like an 8th special slot, but it's increased by crafting upgrades or building more stashes.  Or even a reasonably-priced, account-level atom shop upgrade.  Wouldn't be the first game to offer that.  Not really affecting balance, just how much you can hoard.
---
Still would kinda prefer storage to be limited based on item quantity instead of weight, with a stack limit for junk that's high enough for me to dump everything out of my inventory without having to play the item management mini-game.
---
I said bro now u have a nice house that will impress all the ladies lmao
---
Xbox one regular, only source of my crashing.
---
There are like 4 fissure sites that are unmarked that i’ve found
---
Well, if you re not asking for anything in the first place...
---
Not good on mobile. Unable to scroll the list. Should also have a search.
---
Add crits in the equation. I 3 or 4 shot them with a basic 10 mm. 
---
So why does there need to be a notification if you already know it disables it?
---
toxic valley - all "soot flowers" actually pop into your pipboy as TOXIC. Just doesn't display toxic when you see in the wild for some reason. 
---
I've found quite a few north of the train station/west of grafton
---
Good Idea for Armor, as I rearely get mods whislt scrapping armor, but I don't really see the need for weapons, as every weapon I scrap I get a mod from, I rarely don't get mods from weapons.  Plus it might be better in the luck stat as the Int stat is already overpopulated when it comes to crafting.      
---
Je just won’t be able to feed’em
---
Also if you are in pacifist mode and another player attacks you should be able to switch out without having to go to game settings.  Like a popup that says [Click RS and LS to disable] or something similar for PS4 and PC.
---
I can't confirm but other people have said it will be a hotfix. But i like your logic. Lol
---
I'm probably guilty of this as well but in my defense, once you hit level 50, you stop paying attention to level requirements. So it was most likely done on accident.
---
Yeah beats me. Guess we will have to wait and see.
---
Then just dont take it
---
I have a pc, but I got fallout on Xbox to play with my homies, and then they didn't like it so I play it by myself on the inferior platform. Lol 
---
I hope it's enough to hold all my junk, i get tons of adhesive and other good stuff but just chuck it away.
---
Thanks for the fast response.  I will try both of those methods, but I don't have a lot of hope either.
---
Ah that makes sense. Was caught off guard when I heard gunshots and came out of the building to see all of them.
---
My mistake. Fixed.
---
He means sell the plans. Though I have bought a fusion generator on the trading sub for my alt. Paid a guy mats and caps to place one in my camp.
---
Once you have dropped a nuke and explored you are finished unless you like hanging around the whitespring all day for better guns to hang around whitespring with.
---
Thanks 😊
---
My camp is next to that. I recently went back and to the lookout and saw that. It’s a sad story for sure. I’m just disappointed that my camp has been there for a long time and I just noticed it a few nights ago. 
---
Bird bones mutation helps 
---
This is what makes the game so damned fun, you never know what to expect, happen to me several times, had to SB and a flatwood at the same time, Moutchman pops up sometime as well, nice with some visitors, lol
---
If you’re on Xbox I have about twenty cards I can spare.  Free. I had the same problem, esp using the marksman..that hurt. A two shot or even non two shot explosive weapon works wonders on them now though, to the level that I pretty much just farm cargobots to sell cards. I have a two shot 50 cal that also does decently with the power armor stabilization perk, idr if that’s its name but at tier 3 it adds 45% accuracy while in power armor. That + the dot reticle in 3rd person makes them a lot easier
---
It doesnt disable pacifist mode. It's just a warning that while that green circle is showing and you are trying to claim a workshop another player might try to kill you and claim it themselves. I guess they thought workshops were going to be a much bigger deal, like King of the Hill, or Headquaters if you dont play Halo.
---
My best weapon drop so far is an anti armor hatchet with 50%faster swing, reduced sprint damage and negates half of armor.
---
Yeah i think so too. It’s just that when you open it and you think “the fuck i m gonna do with that ? Can’t scrap, can’t wear and if i wanna sell that’s a 10 minutes walk to get 5 caps, but if i drop it he s gonna see it and maybe he ll woop my ass for the next hours”
---
But yeah i m sure they just wanted to be helpful and didn’t really pay attention
---
I used to fix up holes and spots like that I. fallout 4 with flooring pieces so easily. Now you have to be more creative with rug placement or some lucky appliance arrangements. 
---
Another tip - if you are like me and like the idea of barricading the doors to the workshops to re-enforce the doorways, an ice box fits in the doorway fairly well and it’s one of the only items you can place directly infront of a door. 
---
If you don’t like this, sorry for the inconvenience. I just hate it when the wolves rip down my doors so I like giving them some layers to chew through. 
---
Sound advice right there
---
Good work sister.
---
It's best to test it out with a pressure plate.
---
IIRC without a terminal it's cycle is set to 10 by default. So step on the pressure plate 10 times and then it will transmit power. Terminals can change how often you have to activate it.
---
It's not broken, but it's still kinda useless without all the other pylons/switches from fo4
---
$1 hahaha no but seriously people pay an arm and a leg for these things. 
---
lmao 
---
Then I don't know, and sorry it didn't work.
---
Same as well. Getting to the point almost unplayable. I do not even start any longer quest missions because I know I will be disconnected and have to start again. 
---
how the hell does one get this?! oO
---
It registers as pistol kills on enemies or did a couple weeks back anyway. Haha
---
I also run the extra harvest perk before I harvest so i can yield extra crops. Double starch that way.
---
That’s so odd. I just noticed this last night and was planning on doing some experimenting tonight to see if it were true. I’m not sure if the health regen is the cause or the effect, but I’ve noticed a correlation between the regen and legendary drop. 
---
The terms of service for the game explicitly says you agree to not use any third party software while playing the game. 
---
That’s all on you man 
---
I get what you mean entirely! I tend to stack concrete posts on top of each other, main downside though is if the bottom one collapses they all do (if I remember correctly). Though I'm also fairly certain you can place several doors in a single doorway, that'd be another way to slow them down.
---
You on Xbox? I saw a small camp the day I found this. It had a piano by the front door. Also had an extractor that had turrets on top of it. Near the truck trailer? 
---
Come on over to /r/Fo76FilthyCasuals.  We have cookies and picture posts.  :-)
---
I so want a "Look I've dropped you something" emote. Say me waving a brown paper bag. this will stop this problem as it happens to me all the time. I've stopped chasing low levels around the map trying to give them my extra plans       
---
It'll probably just stay in your stash box.
---
Omw 
---
With radaway and rad-x, radiation poisoning is basically a choice at this point!
---
I try to accept them in nuke zones to help out but they keep autodeclining. Not sure why. Probably server lag
---
&gt; Read the notes and listen to the holotapes.
---
Who are you saving, and from what grisly fate?
---
Oh look, Aperture Science!
---
Good Point
---
Found on the second floor of white springs. There's nice little nuke-cola bar. There's only ever 1 or 2 at a time though. 
---
Xbox 1, Stevetron00, no ticket
---
Every time I touch an acid pit the game crashes.  In fact most workshops crash very quickly.  It's frustrating because I can't farm resources with the extractors I set up.  So I'm bleeding caps and junk every time I set something up.  
---
But rebuilding them is easy, it usually only takes one cement, but sometimes they manage to break down each layer ( I’ve had this happen a few times now )
---
Look on the bright side. Grandma didn't die.
---
Over the holidays I've been playing 8 to 10 plus hours a day and MAYBE end up on a server that had a nuke go off once a day. You'd think it would be more common given the responses on this forum.
---
So, Bethesda runs a mini event that ends up bugging out (this is Bethesda after all) and I swear every other thread for the last day or so has been "muh nukessssssssss". 
---
Ok thanks for your input.  I dont mind glitches since ive been a fan of FO since 2. The lack of NPC's and story and empty maps  is what worries me.  Im just worried its gonna ruin FO for me.  Guess ill just see for myself. Ill pull the trigger tonight.
---
This is the wider non-stash Locker, from Whitespring right? Cause tahts what im missing, read this post, bought Plan: Locker from Watoga RR, didnt unlock :(
---
*What? The nuke silos are offline. I havent heard about this yet.*
---
I wouldn't call it a witch hun, it is more like a circlejerk, like when people say "EA bad they make you pay for everything", without knowing that EA changed is business practices a while ago.
---
The ones I collected a few weeks ago and other stuff I keep for the "hard times" (aka no time to play but can do a daily 15 min shop run) are still stacked... now that you mention it tho, most or all the newer apparel I picked up appears to not be stacked.
---
This may actually be a side effect of some preparatory steps Beth took to detect duping, fingers crossed. Or they just broke something randombly. Wouldn't be surprised.
---
More like 3 or 4k caps, and rightfully so, they take some getting, caps are easy to get back :-)
---
They do belong to the player, since he is set as 'owner' once he claims the workshop.
---
No PS4. I’m just east of it. When I travel back to my camp I kill the 3 ghouls and pick up some extra junk. I’ve had a variety of enemies spawn there so it’s not a quiet little place I’d hoped it would be. 
---
It will be Deathmatch / Team Deathmatch type affairs, most likely.
---
I know you can move a pre built door and place a new door in its place. After half an hour the old door moves back into its old place and the new door is sitting “underneath” it in the same spot. 
---
I also did this by accident the other day lol
---
Wow didn’t know that. I pick it up regardless but good to know.
---
While I love some of the personality they've given Protectrons in this game (Harpers ferry, anyone?) I think a DJ Protectron would get old pretty quick.  Now, a Robobrain DJ on the other hand.....
---
I once gave my friend 785 dirty water and he boiled it down and made me walk with him across the map while heavily overencumbered to a new player, where we dropped all the water we had.
---
Don't ask me why, but martial arts card makes it fire 30% faster.
---
I just tried it in whitespring, with the adrenaline perk and flame mod. Works great and can save my main weapons when needed. Durability is nice on it aswell. 
---
Would have been crazy if it would have been your camp. 
---
I totally understand, I do it to my friend a lot. I forget that I'm level 103 and he's only 32. (I play much more than he does) He has an arsenal of weapons...when he gets to level 45 lol.
---
What weapon are you using ? I’ve been able to get good damage with any weapon type . Maybe it’s your build? 
---
I also tried this. Bought a 250 cap plan and the vendor got about 15 caps. 
---
Hey again I’ve been using full screen recently with better results. Also, setting in game texture quality to 0 whilst bumping up the minskip value to 512 resulted in best looking and running textures after all. Even though it says ‘low’ Ingame it certainly doesn’t look like it! I honestly can’t tell the difference from High. the minskip at 512 is useful to make sure they’re not too low/muddy
---
I cant imagine not having a functional base so and risking having my useless base nuked, in order to farm 10 ghouls
---
&gt; I don’t play with female gamers unless I know them IRL cuz they will play the gender card
---
Love these posts. "I'm not a racist see, I I have a black friend! Now the black are... "
---
You are generalizing mate. She might be an arsehole (if the female player you mention ever existed in the first place) but she was right about one thing. Your mysoginy... 
---
Nope. If it's unclaimed, I'll claim it for the xp and plans. I'll defend it against mobs, but if another player wants it, they can have it.
---
Given how unstable workshops are, it's not worth it to me to try and build and fortify a workshop that I can lose on a server disconnect 10 minutes later. 
---
I have a Quad Explosive Handmade and it is glorious - in a team of mutated team members and Gun-Fu it is fucking hilarious to Marsupial jump up in the air, VATS to a mob and just spin as I VATS-Fu from target to target as i slowly descend with Birdbones. A teammate actually put the drum on his quad handmade and has a 140 shots. nuts.   
---
Moments like that makeup slightly with the frustrations. Just slightly. okay. hardly but still its all about the little moments and not thinking about how you lost a 3 star vampire weapon on the ground because you accidentally dropped it and the server immediately crashes afterwards.   
---
fucking bugs. 
---
It’s Y2K
---
Yeah, this irritates me that it's off. Good post.
---
We're ignoring energy here are we? And before you say nothing does energy damage; scorchbeasts.
---
When you pick up legendaries , make sure you are checking how many stars they have . 3 star items still only show 1 effect with a simple scroll over.
---
Yep I agree but if course it seems lots if people do it and with no tutorials........anyhow thanks for your thoughts.
---
Anglers used to he a good way but then they patched them so now they only drop 1 to 3 instead 5to 8
---
No! I just tried. same speed. Funny it's said firing rate 500!
---
That’s right! There should be something against duping items 
---
If you follow the objective marker eventually it curves round. It takes longer for obvious reasons but at least it still works
---
Works for most of the Children of Atom 
---
Oh no if they arent gonna do that shit then I have no problem. I have had so many cases with people doing that shit it just seems that every gamer girl I encounter plays the gender card. There have been exceptions and I am good friends with them, it’s just becoming a stereotype that they play games becuase they are a girl, not becuase they want to be playing games. So many streamers have terrible content but are popular becuase they are a girl 
---
Mods can't get you banned.  They never could it was FUD
---
1000 5mm ammo weighs 1 lbs... why would you waste 2 points on bandolier?? Strong back gives +20 lbs at lvl2.
---
Besides, wear full unyielding gear and keep your health around 50%... nonstop 300+ max carry weight
---
About 1k due to flooded market of dupes.
---
He’s like Jesus . We are all holding up our empty baskets and he is filling them with bread and fish lol
---
In all seriousness , hopefully they fix the dupes before they release 4/5 star legendaries so this guys whole inventory turns to scrap 
---
I still have to unlock three more levels of gunsmith to get it anyway, have been power fist and deathclaw gauntlet this far (level 68) lol
---
That is Sentinel and is a legendary armor ability.
---
Strongly agree!  At white springs nuke last week there were 2 high level players telling the low levels to go away and wouldn't stop shooting some French kid who kept asking them to stop killing him.  I told them to stop being a-holes but not much else I could do. 
---
Just keep hitting R and escaping out, eventually the 200 will show up.  Took me weeks to discover this, I've been complaining they they were always at 0.  No need to log out and back in.
---
Clicked the link to read the rest of it. OP already copies and pasted the whole thing. GG.
---
I have a 3* Cultist Dagger: increased dmg to scorched, increased limb dmg, and 1 to endurance.  Also an assasins cultist blade with 40%p power attack dmg.  Been sitting on them for a while if your interested?
---
&gt; against the law
---
The game is in the leveling.  There really is no endgame for casual players like you and me.  It is just a gear grind (not unlike most games).  So enjoy the leveling.  
---
X-01 armor takes the blast's just fine :)
---
You will have it soon, and in the beginning, use you rofle to mark the enemies and gt you loot with help from other players.
---
When you get into the bunker, you will get your X-01 plans, and can buy a Gauss plan at the vendor there (about 1150 caps) , make a bunce of Gausse's to get all mods by crapping them, then you will have nicer rifle to use :)
---
Yeah fortunately they're easy to do! I think that as long as the door is open, another can be placed in the frame as well, so you can keep placing as many doors as you want in a doorway.
---
The dudes content is solid, but the sponsorship is shady af
---
Also just start a new character and roleplay different  builds
---
Don't forget that the extra energy resist is good when dealing with scorchbeasts. 
---
play the game
---
They do all respawn, have countless copies of to many lol
---
Ok thanks I forgot the name
---
Meh, kinda helps balance the much stronger weapon.
---
What are the 3 star effects?  What level? I'm looking to get one at some point but not around till later
---
Geez this has been the most popular sub I've ever posted lmfao.
---
I gave up setting up turrets at my settlements, I'm at Lvl 35 ( top of the world) and the most damage I've come back to, is a couple of broken walls and damaged crops. And you can store the damaged crops instead of repairing them and then place them on the ground again. 
---
I also go back to my camp every 45 mins to 1 hr or so. I'm not sure if this helps as I notice I only really got attacked when I had a long time between visits. or I was really far away (camp arond morgan town and adventuring in Welch).  
---
It would be cooler if you could deposit like 3-5 cards and get 3-5 cards randomized back to you. Somekind of exchange or event would be nice. there is DEF something pu with this object in game. 
---
I find radium rifles to be most effective, especially automatic ones. Try and get to higher ground if they are high above. The ones that appear in watoga take the piss
---
It's not as bad as I expected. I mean, there's still a ton I'd fix/add/etc., but it's not the worst game I've played.
---
One thing that has been nice is this is the first Fallout my husband has really played for any length of time. He know how much I love the fallout universe and he's tried so much to get into the other games. They were just so overwhelimg for him on his own with managing inventories, stories, characters, buikds, etc.  This one is different. It's so simplified in many ways. He can drop in and out, help me kill enemies and scav items and be helpful. 
---
Thanks!  Every once in a while I'll see a vendor bot have one for like 17 caps and I'll buy them but I haven't found any elsewhere.  I'm always short on adhesive so being able to make it with tato, corn, and mutfruit would be nice (and tatos/mutfruit are easy to find).
---
TSE?
---
It's a 50/50 chance that it will work but there is only a 10% chance of that happening. 
---
If you want a hint: Follow the power lines.
---
4 damage?! That's gotta be a glitch. 
---
Its always a generator.plan for me.
---
So kinda like the trading post you pick Veronica up in new Vegas? I’d be down for a setup like that, no fancy assholes selling you ‘swatters’ or whatever moe called them in his final hours, just good honest humble traders. +1 OP
---
No it doesn't, it's terrible design for durability.
---
I think weapon plans are actually the last thing you do learn after you've learned all other possible mods for a gun.
---
We just went through a bunch of major holidays where I bet a lot of their staff used vacation days, personal days, etc. 
---
Everyone is probably getting back to work this week and next.
---
Maybe chill a little?
---
Our 'crew' has been making our own fun and games, from racing each other to Clear West-Tek, to 'build-offs' for camps and ghoul golf (yes its pretty much what you think) near whitesprings we make up our fun as we go. Latest one is a weekly treasure hunt that will involve a cap buy in with a winner takes all pot, using a macro and list of junk assets to generate a random list to find... like many sandbox games you get out what you put in. 
---
They dedicate their lives to the game and forget about friends and family
---
That would make end game legendary farming even more useless than it already is. But yes that would def work.
---
The netcode, combat controls, weapon handling, player movement, etc are also terrible compared to other pvp games so it's not like it would draw in anyone even if balance wasnt game breaking
---
Prepare to spend a load of caps
---
I'm out of the loop. Who or what are dupers?
---
This is funny. In ESO the situation with vamps is the exact opposite. Vamps got different skin and people have been begging devs to make vamp skin optional for years now.
---
Batch crafting for everything.  The only way to unlock mods for some weapons and armor is to craft and scrap.  
---
Batch crafting should have been in at day one, and it makes no sense they still haven’t enabled it.  
---
One second cooldown on single item crafting, and batch crafting would fix several issues.  
---
I love mine.  I use it more than better items.
---
You are profiting off of a license for a game that was given specific terms of use which are being broken, so the game company is entitled to damages of a minimum of the amount sold.
---
It's vaguely similar to ripping a CD and selling it back in the day, it's not your property to make money through.
---
The exception to this was the Real Money Auction House in Diablo 3 for a while where it was sanctioned by Blizzard.
---
I wish they would bring it back!! Gotta love the serial killer clown look!!! 🤡🤡
---
Congrats.  That vats bonus is great for SBQ fights since no one knows how to properly ground &amp; disable her unless you do it yourself most times.  Hope you put it to good use when those nukes are working again.
---
There are a bunch of toxic soot flowers near Morgantown train station too, they're bleached white. 
---
I can only imagine what kind of loot you'd find in BGS in a Fallout game where you can visit Bethesda, MD.
---
NPC's are what everyone wants. If NPC's were announced tomorrow you would all be in support of it with thousands of up-votes.
---
What fancy blue dress?
---
I can't remember where I got my gourds.  Might have been Raleigh's bunker.  He had those or melons or maybe both.
---
I think it's a temporary state. BGS doesn't, and never did, know how to balance a game. so instead of facing more critics for useless / underpowered / cookie cutter builds, they went with this admitedly way too fluid system so people can try and swap skills.
---
Ubisoft did the same with Odyssey when you can respec your character anytime (and can stock tons of equiment to support any builds)
---
Indeed, that is the point of what I was saying.
---
&gt;You don't need to attack to take one from somebody else.
---
Uh, yeah you do.
---
Brah thank you. I wasn’t sure if it was just my game glitchen or if it was global. I’m glad to know I’m not alone.
---
Gatling gun works well but I downed my first one with a regular Handmade, perforating mag and max Tank Killer.  You find them at different levels too, I don't bother going to look for them, all the Cargobots I've gotten have been chance encounters, they come to me lol.
---
For me it would already be enough, if VATS just targets the object nearest to the crosshair.
---
As it currently is it seems to target the object that is closest to your character.
---
Exactly I was pissed at the idea they were selling tricentennial cosmetics that weren’t included in the tricentennial edition it’s just not right.

Here's another spot. Encounteted the Willie Wonka wannabe and a triple SB battle.
---
Probably old news now but I’ve come across a “Tales From The West Virginia Hills” comic called “ Who Goes There?” And on the front cover is the Flatwood monster the bonus attribute received when activated.......+15% Dmg. vs. the Flatwoods Alien.
---
I reckon that’s pretty much 100% confirmation that the Flatwood monster is an Alien 👽👍🏻
---
Yet in no other iteration of fallout have you ever been able to rework your character skills so easily, if at all.
---
And making it so you can't jump through the tall brick windows. 
---
The receiver on the sommerset is probably higher tier  
---
Durability should be based off amount of time it's fired not the amount of hits you get.
---
My best drop was a 3* anti armor, swing speed, 90% reduced weight Super Sledge. 
---
I have most good melee rolls available but I’ve bought and traded for nearly all of them.
---
Yeah its on a terminal and you have to download the schematics. In the Vendor room that sells X01 parts. With all the workshops
---
whitesprings
---
I was one of those shameless fucks who bought that content for 4 not only for the building items but the new crafting stations. I'd love to see it again.
---
I was so disappointed when I learned the Slocum's Joe in the forest wasn't real.
---
I always put my extra plans in a train station container and have found others things left by others there too. The best to look for are Whitespring, Watoga, and Pleasant Valley.
---
The real question is Carnivore or Herbivore. Still can't decide lol.
---
You can't recraft them after you dump them. Ree.
---
Could be I just assumed he was talking about the orbital supply drops.
---
Kill a frog, loot legs and you should get it automatically.  They also drop uranium so I always shoot them when I see them.
---
Women aren’t exempt from behaving like #1, themselves.  
---
I love every song on the radio but I can tell you at level 123 I now know every song word for word and I really wish there were more lol.
---
THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE!
---
Same difference assuming decent aim.
---
Let a few ghouls hit you.
---
&gt; It's vaguely similar to ripping a CD and selling it back in the day, it's not your property to make money through.
---
Not even close. Firstly, you can't sell caps or a TSE to someone who doesn't own the game.
---
Secondly, you are not encroaching on Bethesda's profits so there are no damages or loss of revenue. Bethesda don't offer the service you are providing.
---
Thirdly, ToS and Terms of Use are not litigation. It is not a crime to break ToS.
---
Here we see the game breaking 
---
You can also jump again before the animation finishes. 
---
From a collector's perspective, I wish they were upgradeable. But every legendary you get through these quests gets overshadowed pretty quickly after level 50 anyway.
---
What law?
---
You can grow both melons and gourds, but not pumpkins.  I doubt they'll let us grow pumpkins since that would make the pumpkin daily even easier than it already is.
---
Of course and super duper with the chance to get double from that.
---
that wasn’t what I was asking? I’m aware that the flatwoods monster is an alien, just looking at its design pretty much confirm that it is an extra terrestrial. What I was skeptical about was if the flatwoods monster is from the Zetan race, you know the specific green aliens you find in fallout 3 and 4?
---
It tells you what it does.
---
Not really great advice to go farm plants for a 5% xp boost. That time could be better spent just killing stuff instead for way more than 5% gain....
---
Ant Meat, Radstag Meat and Ribeye Steak are my go-to carry weight foods

But then my multi shot lasers,  plasmas and two shots will have equal durability to their single shot versions 
---
Unfortunately not, it's the worst. I have an idex card next to my keyboard that I jot little notes down. 
---
Thankfully key words now stick out to me, things like the ULTRA RARE ivory grip handle or chemistry station. 
---
Legit, if you find these plans... *make it rain emoji* /s
---
Check out Zenimaxs involvement in discussion regarding the reduction of violence in video games. Shooting green ogres is a-ok, but not hunan on human violence. Also gambling does require a different rating, your feelings aside.
---
I am not able to sprint since Beta day 2.
---
At this point I even doubt sprinting is a thing in this game.
---
Elevation AND distance if closer than 100 distance units. Both lack in the PA compass.
---
Oh nice. I'll have to try that when i unlock it.
---
Jump right as you land and it cancels it out
---
That unlocks several of the tan colored cabinets in stash, so I guess something went wrong for you. I bought that one for the wall cabinet, and of course that one is broken AF. Doesnt snap onto walls, the snap point is like the other floor cabinets, when you place it, it is halfway through the floor.
---
I dont do mutations, to each their own :-)
---
drink water from river, stand on punji sticks etc
---
Lmao I know this is an old thread but damn that's like ordering something on Amazon, then canceling it because you realized it'll be shipped with USPS instead of UPS or smth. Some people are just ridiculous lol
---
$60 is for the game people... If they were to put it on Steam at launch, they would have marked up the price 10-15%, or however much steam takes away from them. Thinking that they are entitled to the "comfort" of steam because they are paying big money is just idiotic.
---
Go-to /fo76bazaar and pick them up for around 500-1k each
---
Abusing an exploit - report.
---
The point is not my lower damage, i run a support/medic/carry weight reduction str/cha build so i know my damage is low (then again its sad that there is no need for support builds in this game with buffs/debuffs/heals at least atm.), the point is that some weapons are so overpowered and unbalanced compared to the enemies/content.
---
I found my first handmade rifle on a stray wolf. I can now see why I should’ve taken that one guy’s bribe with a handmade rifle plan for pvp with him
---
I knew some people would be more interested in the stat boosting foods.  When I said we're drowning in recipes this is what I was talking about.  So many recipes increase stats by 1-3 points.  I thought it would detract from the discussion on recipes that give performance bonuses and it would have made my post twice as long as it already is.
---
Has no effect when used though?
---
Sorry. I don't get it. What are you doing here??
---
I don’t believe that they released this game buggy as shit (Classic Bethesda) and didnt think there would be any dupe glitches. ESO had dupes, Skyrim had dupes, what the fuck was the reasoning here?
---
They have the tools or they need to acquire the tools necessary to monitor and ban these people
---
you don't need a recipe to cook frog legs
---
K mate, then just keep your "cause I know they will use their gender to try and grab freebits" out of your argument then FFS. NO THEY WILL NOT. Some might. Women as a whole won't. Sexism is all about stereotypes, see? 
---
It says specific genotype so it probably just means a specific animal. Not humans.
---
Someone said with the nuke sites down all cards are now null.
---
Still, these duped weapons will be gold to someone on their way to the best gear, of course it will drop in value but someone will pay a nice amount of caps even if it will not be top tier 1 forever.
---
It may be fixed someday, they are supposed to increase the PA landing blast damage, but there is none to begin with at the moment.
---
Even then, it is highly impractical to use anyway, you either need some elevation or a jetpack (only to land in the middle of mobs out of AP). Very cool but ultimately useless.
---
Some of them have already been making irl money from selling duped items, so i don't think they'll get tired of making money. Just do a quick eBay search for two shot explosive. There's plenty of fools that pay for them.
---
It has many RPG-like mechanics, i would say this is a survival RPG.
---
Vats seems to lock on the storage container on the bottom doing no damage. Aim for the thrusters.
---
You can use mods safely. :) I was very worried about this myself but Bethesda has confirmed that bans for mods are not happening. There were some bans recently, but those were for people using Cheat Engine. 
---
Why anyone would actually want to buy anything from this rip off of a cash shop is beyond me.
---
Thanks PoshPopcorn, the legendary I received so far from enemies are worthless, like ghoul damage resistance armor etc...
---
All good!
---
Well that's my main issue with this game: they stripped away so much of the core personality of FO1 through FO4 to shove in multiplayer.
---
I know a lot of fans had serious issues with FO4 and I get why, but I though it was a cool fallout shooter with a meh storyline, and a meh RPG.
---
But now this game, which I rather enjoy for what it is, is basically a bad FO4 with multiplayer. Too many compromises and too little personality. Like you can't even snap in decorations to shelving like the display furniture in FO4! Never mind placing objects in cells and them being there when you zone. It's all paper bags now.
---
Oh no that guy is *TOTALLY* lying. Dont believe a word he says. Dont do Monster Mash. It is terrible, you should stay away from there. Go farm the golf club in White Springs instead.
---
That's great for console players (!)
---
farming for TSE non-level 45 weapons or any main quest i stopped doing to farm =|
---
I spent 15 minutes clearing out the ammuniton factory the other day only to hear the workshop being taken the second that I killed the last super mutant on the roof. When I came down, someone had snuck in while I was fighting and waited next to the workshop for it to be available.
---
I hopped in the zone to block them, but since the didn't yet own the workshop and hadn't attacked me I could only do slap damage. They refused to actually fight for it and just stared at me spamming angry emotes while I slowly whittled away their health 5% at a time.
---
What do you propose happen in this situation, if you feel pvp should only be something you opt into? How could a player defend against this kind of douchebaggery?
---
I just want to make sure that if the system is changed, it doesn't give assholes the ability to do dickish things without any reprocussions.
---
Suggestion: Add the lookout towers. It know they are null by using this map, but it’s helpful for any location markers I may have missed.
---
Where is the fast-travel mat in the build menu? I used it during BETA and never found it again after release. I thought they removed it.
---
Grind for the event weapons
---
Yeah, its silly. Monster Hunter World is even considered an RPG for example.
---
I’ve had the exact same experience, I was level 5 and some guy gave me a shit ton of ammo for my best weapon, 
---
It's listed under aid so how would it be used as animals?
---
How do I get white walls like that?
---
I had this literal exact same thing happen to me. I even know the safe you're talking about. I got on comms to ask the guy who was there to kill me and then he ran off instead. I just went to flatwoods and kept asking new people to kill me instead.
---
I want all the different visual armor variants available as skins. Metal armor paints, raider buttressed and normal variants, and the different armor weights (invisible, light, sturdy, heavy). If they are reasonably priced, I will pay atoms for that.
---
Or just give us a transmogrifier.
---
It is very good, 30% chance to get double when crafting anything, for example 1 stimpak turns into 2 diluted, with chemist you get automaticly double so 4 and with super duper a 30% chance to get 8 diluted from a single stimpak. It also works when you craft weapons, if you are for exampe crafting weapons to scrap to get some mods, i havent found any powerfist mods in game except when i craft power fists and scrap them.
---
If you can get 24 people to agree on doing something, all at the same time and date; you should drop Gaming start a political party.
---
I search everywhere for the password of blocked computers. Especially in the area of ​​the antennas, someone seems to have discovered something about the aliens, but was kidnapped by men in black. and I explore 80% of my time in the swamp, I'm sure I should stay in a very well hidden bunker 
---
Steal all phones at Winterspring. 
---
Glad to hear it! :) It is frustrating that such consistent negativity exists. I am happy that you were able to look past it and take the chance to experience the game for yourself.  I won't lie and say that there game does need some work, but it isn't near as bad as many make it seem. 
---
I have an issue with one of my wireless headphones and the others work fine.   May try swapping hardware.   
---
Also for done dumb reason under audio in options voice chat turns off on restart.    May want to check if it's set to off, area, auto, or team. 
---
Haha
---
You are bloody wonderful 
---
Congrats!
---
Its really hard to find one in a legal way!! What lvl are you? 
---
Found my first and only explosive weapon with lvl 160+...quad double barrel explosive :D
---
I got my first TSE shotgun killing a random legendary ghoul I found all on its own in the middle of nowhere.  Wasn't even grinding, and I was lvl \~65
---
Most of us don't we just earn it in game.
---
I love seeing new players come out of Vault 76 and just drop all of my extra plans for them. it trims down my weight by like 10 pounds and gives them a shit tone of stuff to learn and use
---
Orange balls i think. Lol
---
Are you on PC? You can edit the colour in the .ini file. Mine is purple.
---
My husband joined my team after I took a workshop.  He went upstairs, picked a lock on a tool box ... became wanted.    I think it's ridiculous that you can't loot workshop containers of team members. I can see why they would make this apply to C.A.M.P. locks because you don't necessarily want to share your locked resources with someone just because they are a team member, but workshop locked containers should be different than crafted and locked resources. 
---
Haha, I think my brain has adapted my eyes to not register " ivory grip " now, because I finally stopped seeing them. The new plan ive been getting way too many of is T60 motion assist servos. Ive got 5 in the past few days.
---
I had a run-in with one a little while ago,  my explosive double barrel made short work of him.
---

---
Both are exactly what I'm doing now. I've tried to go down SE and fight scorch beasts but tend to not have any luck killing anything. I'd say do what you're doing and level up more 
---
Makes sense! Spinning that hand crank is easier with all that hand to hand training.
---
Yes ... easily switching \*from\* pacifist mode if being attacked would be nice.   
---
That said, if they made pacifist most an "opt out" from PVP you wouldn't really need to switch quickly.  
---
Rip shooting an additional projectile. at the moment it is probably the worst legendary effect for shotguns. instead of shooting an additional spread, it just shoots 1 more pellet.
---
People belly ache so much now. Nice to read up beat thoughts
---
Now if only people would start duping "bloodied" weapons to lower the cost of those.  As a player who is not a vendor/duper, i cant compete with people willing to shell out 20k+ for a weapon just to finish my build.
---
I spent a lot of yesterday farming Watoga for level 50 T-60 power armor, then modding and repairing it and selling it for 5k per set. 
---
Sold two yesterday and working on the mods for 3, but thinking about keeping it.
---
Hah! No, not a duper. I just recognize that whether or not someone duped has zero effect in *my* game. 
---
It’s weird, this desire to punish somebody else for “not following the rules”, even though it doesn’t affect you in the slightest. 
---
Vaultec University has a vault in it.
---
Totally agree
---
You really shouldn't feed into bethesda's whaling scheme like that you're basically a walking billboard to any weak willed whale that sees you wearing that stuff. Better to holdoff and boycott the whole thing entirely until the ethics of the situation is beaten into their collective skulls.
---
So i'm guessing you can't install a mismatched jet pack?  the T60 on a T51 torso?
---
I take it for the plans, maybe set up for resources, then walk away.
---
If somebody wants it, they can have it.  After they nerfed resources, it's not worth the trouble to fight for it.
---
I only go back to fight off PVE attacks for more plans.
---
Agree 100%... Preaching to the choir ... I have been posting this here and on the official forums and I even posted it as a bug ... because why would your targeting system tag a non-target????
---
Maybe your message will finally register.
---
Well its useless anyway i think, dont turrets shoot each other? So the middle ones would just destroy the outer ones before killing anybody, qnd so on row by row til all thats left is the few in the middle
---
I love Red Dead, and GTA. But both of the multiplayer communities are about the same level of annoying. At least in Red Dead you won't get blown up by jets every minute.
---
What hinders even more is that when you die by anything at all. Everyone can just take your scrap.
---
Good lord... another request for totally  reworking the game... what a shit bomb of a game 
---
Yeah my bad couldn’t think as to why you’re replying directly to me this comment wasn’t ment for you, it was ment for a reply to lore masters comment all the way up top sorry man. My 1st ever comment on Reddit the format confused me a tad 😂
---
Supposedly.  I haven't logged on in weeks.  I'm probably going to wait at least a year before I play again - the bugfest continues.  
---
I revomend not farming and just exploring the world and completing the quests you encounter.
---
Wow just...wow, that dress dropped all the time in FO4 and now they are charging 5$ for it.
---
I mean in the 2 of the challenges, it asks you to kill some aliens and the flatwoods monster is a separate enemy to kill. so they are out there, just where
---
its meant to be used as part of one of the vault missions, its not going to do anything to you, as its meant for a specific purpose.
---
Something happend with the silos, on like a third of the servers the silos are glitched and cannot be entered

Working.

Friggin holiday break is over.

Frik.

If you are refering to the "kill xxx with pistols", it's actually about killing xxx HOLDING pistols.. Makes some people confused..
---
It Does! That's crazy!
---
Prius, the silent killer. 
---
I had he mothman spawn at my base i didnt kill because i was lvl 30
---
I do the same, I even leave the vault boy pointing to the workbench and the thumbs up statue. My way of saying go ahead, take it.
---
Ohhhhh that makes alot of sense! 
---
No, sir, I think you were missing the point of this post with your previous comment.
---
I haven't played the game, but you have no idea how many assholes I've come across while researching the game who blurt out personal attacks on others for reasons no other than that they enjoy the game.
---
I am aware that it goes both ways. There definitely are fanboys of any product out there who would at times aggressively defend a product because of its brand. But that's not what OP is talking about. Your experience may have been different, but that doesn't deny the existence of the kind of people OP describes.
---
Don't fucking mess with your mutations! I spent 14 hours straight trying to get marsupial back and ended up buying the serum. That took about 20 server hops too.
---
Get a higher level friends with you to whitespring, nuked or not.
---
You're the opposite from me. I am constsntly getting diseased. Bits are always falling off of me 😐 May be because i live on top of a molerat nest. Constant exposure.
---
They definitely were going to be, then they heavily nerfed them. Only junk has any real value to take now.
---
Whoa, we're talking about the gatling gun, not your "private time". 
---
Its not a problem when you have them ALLLLLL
---
PC:
---
Try to give something to my husband in trade, example, a grenade. Click grenade, set quantity, get to value, set at whatever, suddenly my favorite gun is offered up there instead. This happens a lot. Also happens to him trading me something. Then "Trade failed on server." 4 or 5 times before it finally goes through. 
---
Also, occasionally I'll see an enemy's loot when I first go to loot them, and it'll disappear and be replaced with other loot almost immediately. Example: dead super mutant loot is 4 frag grenades, and they disappear disappear before I can hit E and are immediately replaced with 10mm ammo and a pipe pistol. 
---
A quick idea I had on the toilet: Rather than PVP servers they should have a "vendetta" switch. Player marks a "vendetta" against another player, if they attack then they still get a bounty, however if the player reciprocates then they can kill each other with impunity.
---
I don't believe resetting literally everyone's progress would be "good for many".
---
Got mine doing the forrest treasure maps. 
---
That Gatling can kill the SBQ easy but it comes from a perk card you wouldn’t expect ^^
---
he also passes whitesprings station and goes south from there. Have met him twice there so far
---
I have a feeling it will reduce metabolic functions of fauna with a specific genotype to near death. 
---
But for real there are probably gonna be some nasty critters in the vaults and they will weaken them to make them less difficult.
---
.50cal machine gun is still the best for heavy gunner. Without any legendary effect, it still gets jobs done.
---
TwoShotExplosive
---
The point is your looking to grief because you are bored. You would have a valid point if there was something to gain from your actions but it will only be a handful of gears and screws. The intent is to fuck with someones experience so you can get some giggles. 
---
You found his followup tape, right?  That was Colonel in flatwood and hes got 2 tapes in there.  He got better and more determined to be a good man. :-) 
---
The problem is that the same monsters in the same places can be between level 15 and 60. So in Whitespring Gold Course for example the ghouls can be level 22 if I am there on my level 19, which is fine. But if a level 200 is there before I get there the monsters will be level 60.
---
You can take the crappy legendary loot that you cant use and sell it for caps.
---
He knows!
---
We must act quick to silence him brothers!
---
:0
---
I ended up walking very slowly back to Whitesprings to find that their vendors did have caps as did the bunker vendors.
---
THe compass is pointing to magnetic north not true north.  Add realism/suppose to be there.
---
now about excavator weight carry bonus not comming back every time i jump out and back into the suit.   lets fix that already since we fixed the "pocket" armor bug we just traded it in for excavator power armor bug.
---
Awesome. The Zetans are in the fallout 76 guide book (got it for christmas). However I've never seen one in game. They are supposed to drop alien blasters and ammo. Theres quite a few things in the prima guide prior to release that either changed or got scrapped from the beta/launch. 
---
Pets attack everyone afaik.. They might fix it, who knows.    
---
Though this makes me want to get a pet deathclaw and put up camp outside vault 76! Give the newbies something to put the fear into them early!
---
If he has unspent perk points it won’t show up until he has spent 46 (or whatever the correct level is).
---
VATS should only work in PvE anyways.
---
Great, now he's gonna tell them that the t-60 legs don't take screws to repair 
---
yes please
---
I noticed the quoted fire rate is pure bollocks... it's slow as anything :-)
---
Serious cosmetics you say? https://gyazo.com/f074f405bf2f98694ccb708f90387f7b BAM
---
It's a mmo and endgame should be grind better gear, make better balance there, content with enemies balanced to the damage output,  who cares about the story!
---
Strength: 4D storage (All item weight is reduced by 50%)
---
&gt; If you are in pacifist mode and taking a workshop, you should get a notification that doing so will disable pacifism. Same with stealing from CAMPS and workshops. 
---
But you should only be ably to take that workshop if you can come out of pacifism mode, i.e. your cool down is over.
---
&gt;(aka no time to play but can do a daily 15 min shop run)
---
Are you me? 
---
It was nice to have a sort of gold bar equivalent which I could trade in when needed, but now it's a bit of a hassle.
---
Scorchbeasts aren't legendary so they don't drop legendaries
---
Not really worth it killing them besides the plans and stuff off Queenie
---
When I first read this I read it as you want to go grief and farm level thirty players and are wondering the best place to murder them in peace. 
---
Level 30 players are usually in the north to south west.
---
They don't have mutations yet, so farming them should be fairly easy.  Most don't even have TSE weapons yet.  Hah...
---
Go to whitespring and kill  houls (nuked zone or not) , grind for legendary weapons, doesnt matter what level you are after 50, that's the softcap.
---
he scanned the remains of the scorched who burned themself to stone
---
LOL yes - I forgot that part too.
---
When I first played the quest, the cargobob flew away so fast that I couldn’t even catch it. It crossed the map in less than a minute. probably a bug but still very annoying and just a bad quest really
---
Isn't that what we have now? Lol. 
---
There's a ledge you can get on where the ghouls can't hit you, just open the door, run inside to the dining area and then run down the side exit. Directly in front of you is the ledge with some flowers, you have to hop down every once in a while so their tracking doesn't get all messed up but other then that it's easy xp. 
---
This happened to me but with the xo1.  I had 1 ultracite, 1 excavator and 1 xo1. I log in one day and I have 1 ultracite and 2 excavators.  WTF???  Why does this happen? 
---
Do you still have the extra xo1?  Want to sell/trade anything for the torso with the jetpack? 
---
LMK i'm on XBOX
---
I wish i were big.
---
lol :)
---
And fix the bent third-person camera while you're at it!
---
Deleting items, duped or not, is an easy way to alienate your user base. Most people trade for duped items with legit earned caps.
---
Best way is to just simply release new content that makes duped items useless. Next release of DLC should include encounters and enemies that are explosion resistant and introduce 4* legendaries with some new modifiers.
---
It's +5 rads though each time collecting in river. makes your rads go up quick. Better pop a diluted rad-x first.
---
All goods, once you get an idea on how it works it’ll be easy to use. It took my awhile too funnily enough
---
Yeah they dont buy boiled
---
This drives me nuts. Whenever I fight super mutants I always end up targeting the grenades they throw at me which makes dodging said grenades hard.
---
This is awesome, I have been roleplaying this game as a doctor/biologist and this will really help me with keeping me stocked up on meds.
---
They'll drop plans sometimes, but if you can't kill them easily, it's not worth it.
---
&gt;(plus it is rated T, while this game is M).
---
And around practically every corner I walk is another ten year old who doesn't know how to turn off there mic because ratings mean nothing when most parents ignore them, grandparents spoil and it's so easy to just buy a digital copy of the store.
---
What did you mean, is the silos back up ? :)
---
If u have twoshot or exploding weapon, kill them otherwise dont.
---
We need munition factory subreddit for these stories
---
Add new content with explosive resistant enemies. Throw in new modifiers for L50+ drops. Basically create a soft barrier against duped TSE weapons.
---
Small chance of a prime plan drop from regular SBs and you should get 2x plans for the defend instead of 1.
---
green shirt and combat boots covers up the armor you have on
---
Wasn't able to place foundations so I improvised and used pool tables as supports and linked them together with large rugs.
---
Great advice, but my OCD is conflicting with the advice:)    
---
just like real terrestrial radio you only get the same 5 songs.  working as intended.

Some people thought they did it for the Whitesprings New Years gathering. But according to their [twitter](https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1080188836993515521) it seems like an actual problem.
---
The sniper outfit is really well done. Kudos to the designer.

I think in the cartoon world of Bethesda it's the radiation that makes the end result provide stat boosts

Yeah, i had a lot of fun with that in F4... https://youtu.be/fEH9XafITSc
---
The irony of paying into an exploitative predatory capitalist cash shop to dress like a commie.
---
No, he asked what we're doing... I'm back at my job from the holiday break. ;_;
---
Just use the normal power connectors though a doorway wall piece. Then swap the doorway piece for a solid wall and the wire will stay.. that's how my junk extractor is safely behind walls!
---
A shotgun likely doesn't have enough range to hit a flying Cargobot at all does it?
---
I get the same issue on PS4 from time to time. I have also gotten it shortly after deploying power armor which has caused me to lose a few PA sets.
---
I did recently clear out all non essential notes and holotapes, which appears to have lessened this occurrence, but it still happens quite often.
---
Try eating raw meat. 
---
Nice, if you're on PC I can help decorate it or at least drop you items. Have 97% of the plans for camp objects. I've done over 40 unique builds in 76 so far. Add me in game Enzth.
---
This OCD still has me looking for those Excavator shocks, but at least I'm over it for the X-01.  That stupid 2nd Excavator shock search has allowed me to pretty much outfit most of my PA suits the way I want...  though I think T51 shocks might be the rarest of them all, so that suit is always going to be a garage/stash queen (can't paint the Nuka colors on other feet)!
---
PVPers against PVP servers are just whiny people or griefers. This game is only superficially multiplayer and PVP is a minor mechanic tied to it. 
---
Blade of Bastet and Black Diamond have remained pretty relevant for my character. I also still have Stand Fast at Lv 70. Legendaries are random, these help guarantee some unique gear until you get some good drops.
---
oh, you almost made me happy with this one, lol
---
oh well, will sit in camp and read some magazines, think i have 5-6 of them in my inventory.
---
Can't even find any SB's :/
---
Someone has to dress the villain :p
---
It only seems to do this on my mobile device
---
What if you have say all of the mutations?
---
3 words. Client-side texture mods :p
---
They are brick walls. You can get them mostly from non-train station vendors...I believe that I got brick walls from the vendor in Harpers Ferry.
---
I am DYING for the vault tec pip boy paint job.  I just want to match my armor, Bethesda! Corvega blue just isn't cutting it 
---
I am level 112 with 160+ hours, I think I just discovered every location and I have yet gone to the overseers camp. There is still so much for me to do, but I just get distracted with the world and finding strange and different unmarked locations
---
Agreed.   The same icon should pop up in the upper corner, doesn't matter which one.   I switch the third person just to check if my mic is working.   
---
See berry on ground. Eat berry. Repeat. 
---
Been looking for excavator shocks for a looong time.. Might just grind up caps and buy them eventually..
---
Single Shot Pistols have been working fine, though they lean very heavy towards V.A.T.S usage. Very, very similar play-style to single shot Rifles.   
---
Machine Pistols are fantastic. They lean heavily towards Sneak Attacks/Stealth. Even without Affixes you dish out damage immensely fast.  
---
That's besides finding an Explosive 2-Shot Legendary, since it doesn't matter which kind you find *(except crylator)*. It's beyond broken *(e.g find one = roll end credits)*.
---
I just found a number of fairly decent 1\* legendaries in the last couple of days. Nothing too exciting, but good enough to equip.
---
I got a chameleon piece, a piece that gives up to +35 damage and energy resistance the higher my health (isn't it usually the opposite?) and stuff.
---
On the rubbish side, I've found 2 pieces of Mutant's armour and a handmade rifle with +30% damage against animals. I mean, I hate radrats, but not that much.
---
I'm also starting to find heavy weapons more often. The .50 cal machine gun is very fun for a good few minutes until the ammo is gone. I guess levels 30+ are when the game starts giving you more interesting stuff.
---
Depends, I'm on xbox so it's pretty quick to shoot them a message otherwise it is just tactical use of emotes and emojis. :p
---
I had one sitting in my stash for a while until I accidentally scrapped it one day.  \*cry\*
---
They don't. 
---
Bethesda just pay this guy already:
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/20262](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/20262)
---
And that’s bad?
---
It's under Butthurt Fanboy Law - Bathesda IV
---
Yep, that’s the one. 
---
No, turrets do not shoot each other.
---
Both of the terminals are locked by default. If they weren't for you then someone else unlocked it before you came through.
---
To answer your question though, there are no other confirmed Alien race’s in the Fallout universe other than the Zetan so chances are it is. However as you’re speculating it is completely different to the greens so could be the introduction of a completely new Alien species..hopefully 😎👍🏻
---
Gutteral grunts and humping motions mainly.
---
If that doesn't work, area chat or psn messages.
---
Might be a future DLC quest line where you have to find the broadcast station and hook DJ Robert back into the booth so he can spread the word of the coming and goings on the server and then go to the broadcast towers to boost his signal. 
---
How sad that they need an army of turrets to kill 10 or so ghouls.
---
I kill them in one hit so really not an option - but good bug to bring up.
---
Honestly, there needs to be an "I have a mic!" emote
---
Check your endurance perks and make sure you don’t have any disease resistance perks on. I can’t stop getting sick. 
---
I have lost X01 jetpack, T60 calibrated shocks and T51 mods. They were in my stash all night through multiple server hops and I did not do any crafting so they could not have been scrapped...they just vanished! Thanks BGS, another game breaking bug to add to the list
---
I wanted to kill someone with my assassins explosive double barrel shotgun.
---
Saw someone with 5 cap bounty.
---
TPd over to Morgantown.
---
Wanted player in full x01 gear.
---
Proceeded to shoot him.
---
Pacifist is on.
---
(Fuck)
---
Turns pacifist off
---
Ohk's wanted player.
---
Profit
---
We'll shit. Either I never put it together or didn't hear it. That issue where you hit play and it just played static caused me to miss several holotapes. Looks like I'll be going back and listening tonight. 
---
man, having Calibrated Shocks and Motion-assist servos Excavator armor is awesome. I can carry so much stuff!
---
I’m starting to get the swing of it now 😀
---
Yeah that must be, my gauss used to deal 1400 and now its 700 with grounded. I know im late to this thread but i had to look it up because it was killing me. I think ill wait for a bit and if not ill get rid of grounded, i like my gauss too much its my main weapon.
---
Just wait till you run into the guy who is doing it with missile turrets
---
Nice troll post OP. You got a good number of people with it.
---
I don't see any plans on them. :/
---
I second this
---
Well don't I look stupid
---
do you mean the assault marine helmet? or the marine tactical helmet? to my knowledge the armored one isn't in the game yet only the skinny one [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Marine\_tactical\_helmet\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Marine_tactical_helmet_(Fallout_76))
---
There is no economy. If you want an economy just look outside the window of your grandma's house you live in 
---
my friend got a small recorder and went to youtube and used it to copy the dial up log in noise he then places it against the speaker and hits play the level of confusion when it starts is priceless 
---
been playing around 20 years online you learn how to drive trolls nuts 
---
It’s a new song, I don’t mind it, they’ve added a lot of new songs.
---
I have 5 sets of PA, can't display them so I dont know why, but I want each unique set.... can't bring myself to ditch them....damn stash limit :-)
---
The negative cash flow in FO76 is crazy high.
---
I understand they aren't literally dailies but I just wanna know if anyone has gotten it to repeat at least once? I've repeated all the other dailies multiple times. 
---
I'm not surprised you think "They decide to do some silly outfits = grrr they're copying Fortnite obviously!!!"
---
Even though Fallout already had "silly" cosmetics even before this game. In 4, one example is you being able to dress up as Grognak the Barbarian. In New Vegas, you can literally dress up as a prostitute or in a variety of different bedwear. Don't act like this is something new even though Fallout has *been* doing it way before Fortnite ever existed. 
---
I mean you’re playing after the thousandth update the game has gotten. It would have had to be better than launch by now. The game is truly shit for a 2018 release but if you love shitty outdated games then this is for you.
---
I did the same when the bug was active (not really knowing what was going on until I saw the issue noted - I just thought it was something fun). I thought it was cool until I wanted to build more stuff, so I ended up scrapping all but two turrets the next day. It's rather pointless, unless you're trying to lure a PVP opponent to their death or something.
---
If only you could see where you were going too!! Bethesda, bright flashlight plz!!!!
---
Mutation serums are being sold for bellow 1000c/u on trading subs, even if you lose all your mutation to remove grounded you can get everything back for cheap 
---
It would be nice to have this for the bog.  Are there any toxic soot flowers in the cranberry bog?  Also, as some have point out, some of the colors are too close to tell apart.  In the future it might be helpful to assign each item a color and symbol instead of just a dot.
---
Flatwoods monsters appear to be zetans in levitation suits.
---
Yup, it's sort of a weird niche that's really close to the church. I was surprised as well!
---
Of course I'm just talking for me.  For me it does ruin it.  Too many hours into FO4 and I modded the crap out of it from day one.  That's half the fun of Bethesda games.  How hard would it have been to have an on and off line version of this?  Then people could play the way they want.
---
Haha, exactly!
---
Wataga Shopping center should have them.
---
Please make it not gender specific like the rocketsuit is. Still mad I bought that.
---
I was sadly out in the Grand Canyon when it dropped, otherwise I'd be rocking it for sure!
---
Had that happen to me once.  I went into build mode,  stored it and then set it up again.  That reset it 
---
How does teaming up help with game crashes? 
---
i love the lamposts! how hard is it to move around? do you move it around at all?
---
im basically a gypsy, and i love to design a base but if i stray from the 1 foundation base treehouse, i have a super hard time setting it down in another place
---
Plans have been fixed. I found them in Watoga
---
where you get it ? :)
---
Find what you were looking for?
---
I love dropping people the treated brotherhood under armor ever since i found the plans for it 
---
+1 strength/endurance adds regular energy and radiation defense and it doesn't use any armor slots perfect for starting out!
---
Try hopping at the Grafton Station vendor, that's where I got all of mine.
---
I made my girlfriend watch every time I was about to do it. She only groans now.
---
    What platform are you playing on?
---
 
---
 PS4
---
2) RemeiAoki
---
3) NA
---
4) Closing Fallout 76 application from PS4 Media Bar (while game is running) will actually DELETE the game and all the associated files from the system with no warning to signify its about to do this. 
---
5) NONE
---
Woke up, Had Fallout 76 Running from the night before. "Oh, i should close this game, and reopen it because otherwise, it's not going to load up my friends list." &gt;&gt; Press start on Fallout 76 Application and then hit "Close Application"&gt;&gt; "This will close the application" prompt, select Ok." &gt;&gt; Wait a little longer than normal&gt;&gt; Release&gt;&gt; No Fallout 76 Icon. 
---
Not a mispress, my wife watched me do this while she was loading in. Weird, don't particularly care to make it happen again, as its another 50 gig download for me.  
---
I don't dupe, and I might have a lot of holotspes, I've got like 200 hours in the game. And also, I was being a little dramatic when u said every 30 min, it's not exactly every 30min but it is frequent.
---
I also find it funny how just because I'm crashing I must be a duper or a liar when in fact it could be hundreds of other things.
---
I need 1 Excavator and 2 51s. Never seen a 51 shock.
---
Try power attacking with a 2hander. It is like 2% per swing or something.
---
I have 6 now with the Ultracite set as well.  Some garage queens like the T-51 and Ultracite (due to lack of shocks) but the rest are battle worthy.  They're all max level 45/50 sets.  Trying to paint them differently for flavor too - Tricentennial on T45, Nuka on T51, BOS on T60 and Blackbird on X-01.  I can always rebuild the X-01 legs easy enough.
---
I would say just use TSE until you can find a bloodied version
---
Where did you get the pass coded door? This actually gives me an idea!
---
2 seconds up and a duper devoted the post. Oooft that was fast! 🤣
---
Food don’t stack and nor do drinks but you can have one food and drink of the same effect. 
---
Up for sale items will still count toward your stash limit i assume. Any other solution would be moronic.
---
Thanks, but I already had someone else help me with this trophy. But I can help you if you need it. Sorry for the late reply. 
---
See my other post on the Scorched Beast event. I need help on that one and afterwards, I'm dropping all my stuff that includes explosives weapons, etc. Because I'll be quitting the game after that
---
I disagree that it wouldn't be easy.  The crafting system was designed for a list of singular items, but adding an alternative (or alternative) wouldn't be terribly difficult.  ID:X | ID:Y.  Source: I'm a software developer
---
You can stack up so much damage resist with perks that power armor isn't as much of a necessity. 
---
Lol I see! Nice work
---
Silos are stuck on cool down if you have the missle silo state holotape you can use it and it shows the silos have a cool down of 9999 hours
---
Okay awesome, at least it's a simple fix, still quite strange tho lol
---
We need Atom Cats paint...oh yes please...
---
I have mine filled only with materials to repair my stuff. It's sad how its maxed with almost nothing. Can't hardly keep any extra weapons or armor when getting weapons an armor is a huge part of what this game is about.
---
Right now I am rocking the Fire Breather outfit.  It's the best look I found as a low level since the Atom Store Rocketsuit is gender specific design for female. 
---
how good are prime plans
---
That could work, but for the private servers, if they went that way instead of offline, it'd only be until they have stable Main Servers
---
How about Xbox One S? :O 
---
Know they don't exist yet, but neither do BOS or super mutants.....
---
/tinfoilhat
---
last night i was just north of watoga where there are several "boiling green pools of ultracite" and not a single one of those SBs came out to play... normally i get ganked before i see the green pools \*shrug\*
---
Ah then you don't need to get it you already have one. 
---
You just need the keycard from the Cargo Bot to enter the silo.  You don't really need any pieces of the code because you can get the decryption from nukacrypt.com, like others have mentioned.
---
Of course, this is all once Bethesda fixes the silos this week.
---
Incredible luck or market reddit page, if you have caps, duppers have some top tier weapons
---
Agreed, and also regarding power armor, why do I have drops of water on my helmet when it's raining and I'm inside a building?
---
Yep sadly ill have to do that, thanks mate
---
You still get the xp from the event, and the power plants are good spots for some scrap materials.
---
Check the suitcases in the train stations too!!
---
Yep
---
Welcome to America, where we have screwed priorities and everyone is a douchebag, some more than others
---
(blows party horn) 
---
I think I'd be way more personally effected by someone following me around and calling me a faggot and saying they're going to rid the wasteland of people like me. But what do I, a humble gay, know about being gay bashed and how unpleasant that is.
---
I don't like the dupers but they're not going to make me quit the game. But being maltreated by emotionally stunted wackadoos will. So they made an example out of those people. Good.
---
Pretty much this.
---
Basically, you can't "Bank" your levels to use on later levels
---
currently stuck on this questline due to a glitch with the project siphon holotape, up until then it's definitely been one of the more interesting questlines!
---
If Bethesda really had these tools then why haven't they touched the dupers at all and instead choose to ban some modders instead? Sorry but it's pretty obvious why they're not doing anything against dupers and that's because they can't. Why else would they ignore these people that tank the server stability? I mean hell if you report a duper the reply you get from the support is "Block the player and switch server" effectively. That wouldn't happen if they actually had the means to "punish" the dupers
---
What if they just rerolled all TSE weapons for other perks?
---
Given the ingame hints around vault94, i wouldn't get my hopes too high.
---
so far it's been an enigma it's not a well thought out or polished game and there are things I totally would fix/change
---
I broke down what my thoughts were in categories 
---
graphics- C+, it's not breathtaking like RDR2 or the witcher but some points it's ok looking
---
gameplay/combat- D+, lots of framerate drops and holy hell sometimes it's insane how hard it is to hit a dam mob definitely feels like a step back from FO4
---
building-C, I was obsessed with settlements in FO4 I love base building in any survival game , and FO76 does an ok job but I noticed the budget system is broken and hinders from really enjoying building , as of right now I cant do anything to lower my budget I removed some things and even tried to break walls down but still no reduction on budget
---
story-C+, I have done a ton of side missions,  found a few decent stories here and there but some were boring fetch quests , and so far the main story is basic and pretty lame I have seen alot better writing but I also seen alot worse
---
teamwork/online-B+, with shareable perk cards and the perk cards that improve team work I really enjoy running a little dungeon with friends 
---
perk cards system-A, I found myself sceptical of the perk card, but it was a pleasant experience so far I really like how I can set up loadouts for certain situations and experiences 
---
I hope that helps you with an idea of this game
---
Voice meter banana is a fucking beautiful tool. 
---
Thanks for the reply. To me, it seems kind of pointless to have that in the game then. 
---
Are we talking regular shotgun, or explosive shotgun range? Because explosive is significantly different, due to explosive damage not having any falloff. 
---
You don't have the John Denver version of *Coutnry Roads* &amp; *Thank God I'm a Country Boy* on your phone to listen to in the car?!?!
---
I even have *the Wanderer* (From Fo4). But to be frank, I bought these before the games came out. ;)
---
Get a girl/boyfriend...
---
Ash heap, southwest area I pull 100 screws in just one unnamed area. Results may vary though... it tends to be looted already 75% of the time.
---
Why do you care what difficulty someone else is playing with ? If they do introduce them , there isn’t anything stopping you from running around naked , 1,15,15,15,8,1,1 special , carrying nothing but a syringer filled with love if you want a challenge . 
---
This is a co-op survival/shooter not a mmo,rpg, or mmorpg
---
Yeah the other day when I teamed up, the vat turned me away from the mutant enemies shooting at us, and had me Vat target my teammate. Stupid system. And I have it set to pacifist since I am not interested in killing people.
---
Should be just a matter of time - the PA paints has got to be one of the hottest selling items in the Atom store.
---
Yeh im on xbox and since the beta ive not heard anyone talk other than my team even when ive got area chat on. Dont know if its me or if no one talks on xbox.
---
They grow in the ground and aren't sticking up like everything else
---
Oh, that one. I just spent the free atoms I got to get it. As long as the reused assets are dirt cheap so you can get them for free, I don't mind.
---
Hmm. I'll keep this in mind for the next legendary I see. I did have a weird one in Watoga though where a legendary bot pooped out a 3 star legendary while I was still hitting him.
---
I'd start playing the game again if this was the case.
---
I wish they would put the gunslinger perks in perception :(
---
This might be what's happening I never look for the other ingredients because I could never find them. Thank for the tip
---
Try getting a life while you're at it.
---
It requires some perk investment
---
I agree with this, some better more tactical looking cosmetics would be a welcome addition! Because of this exact reason I have stuck with my hunter's long coat and field scribe outfits.
---
damn youre bad at video games
---
Yeah, the speed of the cargobot alone should be enough defense for it, as well as the vertibots. The added tankiness makes no sense.
---
Thank you so much I’ll try to see this through I’ll just have to ask a friend to hold onto my stuff
---
I just had a two shot explosive lever action with resistance while reloading drop for me off a ghoul yesterday! It's only LV 35 but it does close to 1k damage!
---
Im lvl 220 and i have stuff to do every day. You can do other stuff than farm for the best gear. However, i dont want it to be like world of warcraft where you just doing world quests most of the time. I would like to see more nuke zone events, and scorch queen event. Maybe add random weather that pops up somewhere and there will spawn some interesting boss mobs on that location. Maybe add acid raid in a zone, and you have to build a base and defend it against horde of enemies that tries to destroy it, to prevent getting exposed to the rain.
---
Was the latter person just outside Flatwoods Church? I gave someone all my unwanted plans just outside it yesterday or the day before.
---
I think the whole passing-on-plans thing is a tradition at this point - people did it for me when I was new, and now I do it when I’m in the same area as a low-level player.  Make sure you do it for others when you’re all big and grown up!
---
It was on sale for such a limited time I'm not surprised a lot of people missed it.
---
I would swear I've had enemies hitting me on my side, hit vats, and it targets something in front of me a mile away.  VATS is not very useful as is.
---
Well it's like saying arrest  people who took the easy shortcut lol
---
Me and most of the people have duped items or have bought from duper and you talking about banning 70% player base or so 
---
I've got one explosive weapon so far in this game others I bought it
---
159
---
Interesting...I have a pretty god roll Mr. Handy... I'll have to try this...
---
But if they have the ghoul card, won't overly generous heal them?
---
That's a damn fine weapon
---
Where do all the calibrated shocks come from? I know X-01 is Enclave military wing but not sure for T-45, T-51, and T-60..... Phoenix in Watoga? Thanks!
---
I don't see them at all anymore at Grafton, also at around level 130, i suspect we are too high level , just like with other plans.
---
Go to Fort Defiance, brotherhood wing. Look for military grade duct tape and military ammo bags. 
---
I don't mind looking dignified while fighting a schorchbeast.  I've got all the formal wear I need for that though.  I need more tactical stuff =P
---
I have a shotgun doing 400+..... Like that's the number. I don't do anything but pull the trigger. I have 0 perks for increasing the damage, I actually mostly have melee stuff on if anything at all to do with dmg. No work at all. Just pull the trigger.
---
It was sarcasm man 
---
Not sure if it's a PS4 thing but my armor auto-unequips if it's broken.
---
I agree, defenses should work and you should be able to participate in the defense quest from anywhere and see the progress of turrets killing stuff. There's no reason half a dozen turrets can't take on a few mole rats.
---
Yeah but one more explosion is pretty good still
---
Eat spoiled stuff with low Endurance  
---
Swim around in water dirty/toxic  
---
Diseased Feral Ghouls  
---
Drink Goo *(don't wanna spoil if you haven't been there -- they have a base of 10% chance for disease)*
---
All the three sattelite dishes (Astronomy Research Center, Sugar Grove and i forget the name of the third) have plenty of screws and they are all very close to eachother, within running distance. I set up my camp in the middle and every time i start the game i clear all 3 out.
---
This is already happening. TSE Weapons used to fetch a ton of caps. Like 25k+. Now I see them go for 3k easy. 
---
Me and my friends play nightly, and we usually take on the queen a few times a week, we range from level 100 to 215ish. Feel free to add me, - MrsPrepper  
---
For a laugh they should make Iron Fist let you collect without getting rads.
---
Fluffy! The deathclaw that only loves!
---
Explosive weapons can be nerfed, as they should be. Very few weapons should be buffed by 2 different skill trees( demo expert, shotgunner etc.)  The two shot dragon is a perfect weapon that does a lot of damage at the expense of dps,  as for the whole bad game dev, I dont even know why you added this. Was world of warcraft the game it is today, 6 weeks into its release? Or any other online game? They will obviously add harder content as that is the entire point of the game.
---
Yeah, those substations seem to always have small mobs guarding them. just get a fusion generator and settle somewhere safer.
---
Noob
---
But this has always been the case with bethesda games only difference now is we can’t change the difficulty . I started a sniper and the early levels have been complete hell for me compared to my melee/shotgun build . Idk what’s harder, having to manage my weapons,ammo,drugs, and armor to stay under 165 pounds or backpedaling with a hunting rifle trying to slowly reload and exterminate the 100 ghouls chasing me .
---
 To your point though , I’m sure they will introduce higher level bullet sponges and hopefully will cap pvp damage  
---
Sell it on the market place for max caps. There are collectors out there that want them. No joke!
---
Behind the scenes, Bethesda adds unique ID's to items (like Dark Souls 3).  Don't tell the community.  Dupers continue to dupe with unique ID'd weapons.  Dupers get instantly banned for having duped items with the same ID's. 
---
Nuka Quantum Grenades.  Though, I think they are bugged at the moment.
---
Maybe he wasn't really clear? He said 500 maybe he bought a couple 500 caps a piece?
---
Well to be fair they’re different developers zenimax didn’t make fallout 76 but I see your point 
---
But then I'm at a disadvantage to other players who I may be competing with or against
---
I take a R&amp;B station 
---
Yeah I have the same thing. In vendor menu it's -1 cap, in the pip boy it shows as OP's price which is the max negative value of int... It's a feature right? 
---
Yeah, I was expecting a quick video but ended up watching all 40 minutes because it was cool to see him go through the whole process.
---
On a loading screen it says there’s a small chance of this happening, but it’s never happened to me in many hours of gameplay. 
---
Only poor people . They will be like 1st generation flat screen TVs lol
---
Keep it up!
---
Has your ps plus thing run out?
---
thx :)
---
I just found a bloodied Mr handy and a furious Mr handy last night and have been seriously debating how useful these would be with the right perk load out. 
---
I've one-hit hundreds of legendary humanoids and robots and gotten legendary drops (normal loot for them).  I've two-hit hundreds as well as the bar started to refill, and still gotten loot.
---
A lack of loot is a server and latency problem, it has nothing to do with anything you're doing.  If the legendary loot didn't spawn on the legendary corpse, it's on something that died relatively the same time as it did in relatively the same area.
---
You'll see this constantly when Whitesprings is nuked and legendary gear appears on tons of normal enemies.
---
Loot is assigned in batches, not on enemy death.  These batches are probably run once or twice a second.
---
I have sent them several emails, and have gotten no response.
---
It shouldn't.
---
Is there any difference between a 'cranberry' and a 'diseased cranberry'?
---
I just found plans for the 51 shocks 2 days ago at the BoS watago vendor
---
I think specialization still exists, in the sense that while you *could* eventually get any cards you want, you are most likely to favor a particular class of firearms or melee and put everything behind that.  But it doesn't exist on a macro level of having one player literally do nothing but armor and another nothing but weapons.
---
Part of that also boils down to one of my biggest gripes with the game, the plan system.  Right now, things like Makeshift Warrior have durability tied into them.  This is a crude compensation for the fact that the perk, on its own, teaches you absolutely nothing new when it comes to crafting.  It is baffling that Lv. 5 of Makeshift Warrior doesn't let you craft anything more than the stuff you could at Lv. 1, *unless you've got the plans*.  So, even if a player were to specialize into just weapons or just armor, they'd still have to survive long enough to get the plans they needed to do it.
---
The splash from my tesla gun should not make me wanted.
---
Yes yes yes!!!!!
---
I will add...PLZ plz expand it to properly fit 21:9 screens.
---
I was only in T60 so my DR is 424 and HP 275. I’ve seen posts here with people being one shot in X01 so I don’t think any of this matters.
---
And you'd be wrong.  They are not leveling up.  They're mutating.  All legendary enemies do this when their health first drops under 50%.
---
Easily to verify.  Let a legendary enemy chase you forever after you've done ~10% damage to it.  It will never, ever, heal until you knock it below 49%.

Odd, usually you can store it separately and just replace it (like you do with crops when they get destroyed.)
---
Great list, thanks for the good work. 
---
I usually end up carrying way too many Aid items, but I try to keep it to a reasonable level. 
---
I grow some crops at my CAMP, mainly for adhesive manufacture but also a few others, and I make a point of cooking everything that isn't used up when making adhesive. For one thing, each thing you cook gives you a tiny bit of experience, and for another it's useful to bring a few different soups on the road. 
---
The great thing about food is that if you end up carrying too much of it, you can just eat everything you don't want to keep! 
---
No but i think im having s internet outage so that makes sense.
---
Im not sure if you can get all that in one combo. 
---
Was using paint to do this originally and wasnt expecting to have that many different flora in that area XD im working on looking how to code an interactive map so i wont even need to change the colors 
---
All over really - I spent time at Camden Park, Grafton Station, Pleasant Valley Station/Ski Resort, Welch.  Watoga and Harper's Ferry seems to have a lot more turnover but I've seen them there too, just never server hopped those locations.
---
Thanks, all!  Took me longer to get a full set of T-51b to put it on, but I have it now!  (Will edit post with pics this evening!)
---
Yes faster internet can help as you have less latency and ping to help stuff load faster and be more stable.  
---
With that said you didn't say what you play on so who knows what device you use.
---
What did you use for the raised floors?!
---
I help with quest and give plans
---
I tried :( 
---
That small area in the bottom right i actually didnt map out lol but thanks for the tip 
---
It is possible that wifi rather than a cable could cause more disconnects and lag.
---
Rip I always confused gears screws and springs
---
have you added Luck perks ? how many do you have in Luck ? don't know if it's just me or it actually helps, had 2 in luck, upped it to 6 and started getting better loot...
---
General Feedback:
---
Hello, just started playing 76 recently and so far so good, but the one glaring issue/gripe I have with the game is this:
---
An enemy attacks me, clearly and visibly wielding say, a pipe wrench or a baseball bat, but when I defeat them and search the body instead they have a machete, or a combat knife etc, completely different item to what they were clearly holding, which does wonders for busting apart my immersion. I appreciate it's not a game breaking bug or anything but I do hope it's something that could be looked at/altered :) 
---
I took a break from WoW in November to play this, thinking I will go back after the holidays for the new patch. It's soooo hard to get motivated to do so, especially when I am no where near finished with stuff in 76.  
---
The problem is once your durability drops.. so does the damage so it becomes a unreliable tool.  
---
I've been playing around to see if Nerd Rage works well with these types of builds because its easy for mobs to hit you and drain you down.
---
I have those unlocked but I can't remember what the plan is called. Wish the plan naming could be more precise or maybe the build preview could tell us the name of the plan that unlocks the item.
---
This has been mentioned before but seems to still be an issue. If you complete the Back to Basics quest early in the game, you might lose/sell/drop the Soldier's Certificate required to begin the Brotherhood of Steel quest line later in the game. The Back to Basics quest will then reappear later in the game, with no way to complete it. I've been stuck on this for ten days with no other Main or Side Quests left to complete, except for the bugged BOS storyline.
---
I have a good, stable connection. All three times it happened, I saw a pair of people by the Watoga Station map marke, I'm assuming they were duping.
---
How do I identify a legendary npc?
---
Only good legendary I’ve found was a quad 10mm explosive pistol
---
Pumpkins *are* a kind of gourds, dammit! 
---
(I know they are different items ingame, it's a bit of a peeve I have)
---
About 20 completions of Patrol Duty across two characters and still haven't gotten it as a reward. I'll keep on trying though.
---
Supposedly with the pvp rework comes faction pvp.  I had read in a previous post that BOS loyals will get higher ranked paint jobs.  I imagine the same will be so for Enclave, so hopefully that is one of the first things they do.  For being a General my power armor lacks in flair.
---
Yep it is. Just came here to look for answer
---
&gt; There were some bans recently, but those were ~~for people using Cheat Engine~~ never confirmed
---
I might have read and replied a bit too quick:P
---
put on power armor and go to the water and spam R. you can collect 80+ boiled water in about 20-30 seconds. i was very surprised to find this out. i was also very relieved because i've sat at the water pump before cranking out water one at a time. huge pain in the ass.
---
I didn't do most of the quests until I got to Lv. 50, so I have those to do still.
---
Beyond that, your guess is as good as mine.  I've basically found almost all the locations in the game, save for the south end of the Cranberry Bog.  It's not that the quests are poorly written or anything, but they pale in comparison to the thrill of simple exploration for me.  Mostly because, and this isn't new to 76 or anything, Bethesda clearly expects you to fast travel.  No thought was put into "Let's have the player walk halfway across the map, only to be told to walk halfway back, *and then do it again*."
---
This. Takes me about 3 shots at most. Seriously the best thing you can do with your caps, a tse and marsupial are must have in this game imo.
---
I found an area in the swamp near an abandoned church, it's under an antenna, it has everything inside, it's great. It looks like a real house with everything, besides things reappear. When I return home I send you a photo, it's like a mini underground base. 
---
I can't hear you over my super awesome Blackbird paint.....
---
You unwashed masses best be learning that our only hope is in the Mothman. May his wings bear you to the light
---
You are the kind of person we need more of. You don’t play games becuase your female and get attention or whatever from it. You play games and your female. I know several people who say their a “gamer girl” but they just do it so boys pay attention
---
Damn, wish they'd put that in patch notes :/
---
I'm level 153 and haven't done many quests yet
---
Yea i didnt mark those cuz they arent actual plant spawns that u can harvest and occasionally theres a few snaptails down there too
---
a few dups vs Hundreds man it's easy to tell who got a few tainted items and who abused an exploit
---
why does it weigh more than other melee weapons. just noticed mine last night wouldn't go below 4.2 pounds or 5 pounds some times while my other melee weapons would drop down to 1 pound or less with perks.
---
It does drop in F76 too. I don't know if the Atom shop version is different.
---
My take: Herbivore. You can grow your own vegetables, but you have to hunt for meat and risk that it spoils before you have a chance to cook it. Also, I won't feel tempted to shoot the squirrels ;-) 
---
Someone showed a picture of what was happening in chat at one point. It looked like Barren's chat and /2 Trade were merged. If it's like that, I may just stay away from the mod. 
---
No. Even on a very reliable internet connection and minimal issues with other games and a very high end PC I still get stutter all of the time.
---
Some areas of the map run fine with very high framerate and so on, other areas (like cities) the framerate drops randomly.
---
A lot of the big stuttering is caused when the game very slowly loads in CAMPs or when larger bench operations are done (scrapping etc). The netcode of the game is poorly written and this causes many of the issues.
---
Well I have TSE weapons, but my furious explosive handmade does just fine on the cargo bots
---
I got the plans for it if you want one.
---
90% weight reduction means carry 10x as much
---
Legendary mods drop randomly, and obviously you need at least a 2 star to have a chance at a TSE. Your best bet is to farm areas where these are more common. I would suggest uranium fever as this frequently spawns 2-3 star bosses over 1 Star. Whitesprings has tons of legendaries during a nuke but they seem overwhelmingly 1 Star. You can server hop repeatedly and do uranium fever in about 20 minutes for 3 guaranteed legendaries. The only issue is this event doesn’t scale to max item level so you are likely to get a lvl 35-40 variant.
---
Can I get some help on an existing issue? I have not been able to login for over a week, and cannot create a new ticket:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a8g9xm/banned_account_for_hacking/ 
---
That's my real problem because I know they data mined more suits than are currently in the game I'd rather not have more.
---
I can help nuke and kill her.  Lvl 176 with TSE heavy weapons here.  Just gimme a heads up when you wanna.
---
Psn: goblintactics
---
Team up with a ranged user
---
He killed me last night. I saw him, and tried to run/hide. It didn't work, I had to fight. I ran back to my camp, which was close by thinking my turrets would help... Nope, I died right by generator and then had to repair 2 of my turrets.
---
you can't tame things that spawn in a spot on purpose. so you can't tame this guy :/ or most of the animals in the game. even when i did have the budget in my base to support an animal i would never find one that i could tame. has to be a random spawn
---
Rustic stables 
---
Its because of how the spawning system works. When a high level player enters the cell the enemies will spawn around their level. If they leave any alive they will remain for the next player to deal with.
---
Ill be dropping rhodos and soots off the map in a couple days so that will help alot in that area i guess
---
I don't know about that.  
---
The BoS vs Scorchbeast vs Responders story line was pretty cool I thought.  
---
That cave was awesome.
---
Wait for the "defend workshop" mission. Hop in front of a stray bullet while they are attacking the oncoming spawns. Allows for PVP, then it's game on and may the best player win the workshop. 
---
Fight douchebag with douchebag.
---
Sunny something. I saw another spawn alone while I was walking near the overseers camp last night. 
---
Yeah, it is peaceful (unless you shoot it)
---
I imagine they put it there to scare lower level people...
---

---
Bye Bye blackbird
---
Poorly.  I was once doing an event that dropped bombs on a town. A lower level player was in it when the countdown started.  I began frantically using the "follow me" emote.  But, it does not properly convey "run for your life-- death is coming from the sky!"  
---
Rip.
---
Hi, yeah 2/3 of the playerbase can't use Nexus there chef, myself included
---
It indeed does just fine.  But it's a challenging build compared to more typical ones.  Seriously try a melee build to see the difference.
---
3 star enemies drops armor for me, exclusively :(
---
You mean cornivore?
---
It was available for a day with no promotion.  I didn't even know it existed until later that week and I was playing all day that day.  There's no way they made back the cost of someone developing that skin, it's a complete waste on Beth's part due to a failure of marketing.
---
If they want to give people the ability to have cool exclusive stuff they should have it unlock through challenges in the game.  Not just happening to hit the microtransaction shop at the right time.  That's just asinine.
---
Well they are all powered by fusion reactors
---
I've been kind of tempted to get the Leather Cap to go with my Greaser's Outfit I found early on. Right now I'm using a Sea Captain's Hat or a Cop Hat depending on mood. 
---
Thank you! 
---
Theres 2 farms in the northwest that have about 20 corn plants split between them they actually have tatos mutfruit corn and a couple others there. Everything needed for adhesive farming
---
Oh they didn't. The pump action works right though
---
Not sure how the effects stack. Very likely it’s not additive. Otherwise in terms of DR and ER you can easily rival PA with the right perks and legendary mods. Your radiation resist will never come close as PA has a hidden modifier. If you have 500 RR in PA, and 500 RR in normal armor you will still take huge amounts of rads in a blast zone outside of PA or hazmat.
---
Markers are askew as well
---
Can't they just look at player inventories and delete all but one TSE weapon if someone has more that two of the same type?
---
Is that possible?
---
I've been waiting for a guide like this! One problem I have had trying these - I don't seem to have learned a lot of the recipes. Any tips on where to get them from? E.g.  ***Silt Bean Puree***  and  ***Sweet Tato Stew*** 
---
Dense armor is the best for explosive resistance right now.  
---
A dense assassin's sentinel armor set with some other perks would probably let you survive a few TSE shots...but good luck finding that stuff.
---
Are said buildings separate cells or still in the outside?
---
Well learn something new everyday, thanks
---
Down at the south near slocum joe theres about 10-12 spawns i normally walk away with 22 firecap after 15 minutes with the extra picking perk
---
Selling the ability to google basic stuff. 2 caps or a lamborghini murcielago
---
Good to know, thanks. I wanted to check if I was still getting the effect, so I took it off, saw the numbers drop and tried (but failed) to put it back on. It makes sense that it should auto-unequip. Probably an Xbox bug.
---
I've had problems repairing my armour recently because I ran out of ballistic fiber. I was hunting for screws and springs for so long that I didn't keep track of my other junk.
---
Hey guys, need a 10 minute break, I have to scroll to my power armor...
---
Fuck yeah!
---
Alright thanks I’ve also heard that the monster mash event is great but the last time I went it glitched out and almost no enemies spawned. Hopefully I can find a tse weapon soon enough. And with the 3 star enemies that I kill they always seem to give me 1 star weapons. Is that a glitch or just rng screwing me over?
---
Excellent. We must show those mutant scum our superiority.
---
Kinda works to, first time I saw it I actually changed my plan of exploring the forest.
---
Yeah you should be fine to go back and get it. Same thing happened to me. Absolutely crazy that this wouldn't be more obvious in the quest line or through MODUS' dialogue.
---
The logic for pets seems severely undercooked.  So long as the pet sees other players as a threat and attacks, it makes no sense to punish the player who kills it with Wanted status.
---
Pets need to have a yellow health bar and be docile until they are attacked.  *Then* they can switch it to a red health bar and go to Wanted status.
---
Idk, the crafting system probably won't have an easy time supporting it and it's such a minor thing that we may as well just leave it as-is
---
You choose between a card or moving a point every level.
---
I placed a concrete floor down as low as it would go on the ground, and attached the stairs to it. Then I attached a floor to the stair landing, and continued to attach floors from there.
---
Ah. That makes sense, all the post was really giving note to is that ive been testing the above idea out that if you fight say Legendary Charred Ghoul *2 and you let its hp recover it drops a 2* legendary. I did a side by side analysis on this with one hitting them with a super sledge and then taking my time with a ski sword and I saw a noticeable difference, I started noticing this while stepping outside of the whitesprings grind and fighting enemies that could actually handle more than one hit. I've noticed the same with killing regular ghouls and getting 1* legendary loot from them but was under the impression that was the games way of trying to register the most recently killed enemy and spawning odd loot. I've killed a windego and received something like a pen while killing a ghoul that spawned around the same time and it had the wendigo loot on it. At first I just counted this as maybe the same thing as what the scorched do when they loot a corpse or a player owned bag and take the items for themselves. I will try and get a side by side comparison after I get off work today and upload it to imgur or something then drop a link. I understand where you are coming from and it makes alot of sense. Like I said previously this was just what I personally noticed after getting frustrated killing dozens of 2-3* legendary enemies and getting junk from them. I was thinking that giving it a rolling pin or a drill was the games way of compensating for not having time to draw an actual item from the pool of Legendaries available and it just drops a placeholder item or something for the short time frame. On that note as well I'm curious if certain lobbies have certain item pools as well because during a run at the golf course a buddy of mine found the same legendary gear from enemies that I did just on different ones. Say we kill five legendary ghouls and the first one I check has an assassins walking cane the fourth one he checked would have the same one. Idk that's probably a post for another day. 
---
Yep, I remember it did not show red, similar to the one that appears at the airport, it was diseased level 50.
---
We won! The game is over! 
---
*High-fives and back slapping ensues.*
---
You re-spec where you allocated points or choose a new card, you still get perk packs every 5 levels...
---
Behemoth Stomp Explosion is my They Might Be Giants cover band.
---
You still get perk cards and the ability to swap special stats. Outside of thar you’re no longer unable to use found items, as items stop scaling at 50, enemies continue to scale but it’s mostly health and protections that scale at that point.
---
Using the handpump can definitely be a pain, especially as you need to let the animation cycle (e.g., cooldown).  And I've spent at least 10 minutes getting what I need in terms of dirty water.  When I move my CAMP again, it'll probably just be near a stream so I can just jump in and spam collect.  
---
At a minimum, it would be nice if they had an automated pump that drew maybe 10-20 dirty water for us to come back and collect every so often when we need to restock.
---
Come hang out in white springs we are all under level and running around screaming saving each other from the verge of death for that sweet sweet xp
---
Ha i used to imagine that when i was liitle in the car lol great minds.
---
Think you will use up all your ammo and stims and die lots more.  There are, without naming them several quests that involve Top of the World area.  So my advice would be to get stronger, if you don't want to be sneaking lots. Plus you're going to have to do lots more exploring to the even deadlier East.  Final thought as the enemies are higher level, you'll not be able to turn their guns on the few you kill.  
---
Mob spawning would take much much longer cuz iv noticed some areas the direction you come from affects the spawn like with mothman area the bridge to the south if you come from the south most of the time itll be ticks but if u spawn in there or come from the north itll be bloodbugs
---
I haven't had a scorched officer spawn since sunday. I wonder if it is related. 
---
I was fast traveling like a mofo yesterday to get one for the quest "I am become Death".

Can be like me with my camp I  the Cranberry Bog where I had to remove all turrets or they will aggro the Scorchwings and I come back to my house being Destroyed by 3 Scorchwings and I have to hop servers.
---
Legendary enemies can drop up to their star count. It’s more common to get a 1 Star item from a 3 star enemy but you can’t get a 3 star item from a 1 star enemy. At least I’ve never seen it. Monster mash can be good, but there are no guaranteed legendary enemies just a good probability. You can server hop at black water mine, wait 60’seconds to see if uranium fever pops, and move on if it doesn’t. It’s the most reliable place to encounter a 2-3 star on demand. If it’s night time also look to see if one violent night is up as the wendigo has a good chance of being 2-3 stars.
---
Somebody has already cleared them out or it hasn't reset yet. I recommend buying something cheaper.  If the caps appear they will top out at 200 so you wouldn't be able to recover that 15 caps. A 2 or 4 credit purchase only loses 0 to 1 cap if the caps appear. 
---
I'd love if there were consistency in never targeting robots that you can't even kill.

Ya I’ve ran across a few

Do you by chance, know where is the Marine wetsuit plans are located? I haven't found any plans or even the actual item for sale on any vendor, but eleventy billion plans for marine wetsuit underarmor lining mod. 
---
I found one Shadow combat armor plans, but it was for the arms only. :(
---
search
---
Need to spend some points to be "good with salt" I guess :/
---
im aware of that.  you cant, but bloodied explosive are so rare i was looking for the best replacement prefix i.e. instigating explosive, anti-armor explosive, etc.
---
Makeshift Warrior under Intelligence does this.
---
It is cool to do, but if you're paranoid about other players since we seem to have a growing PvP element to the game then don't build at the substations. They're fast travel markers for everyone and are not far from the beaten path.
---
It is, however, an absolutely perfect place to set up shop if you're selling things.
---
We have the same (un) luck and every damn 1 &amp; 2 star enemy that I kill drops a combat knife or other melee weapon. I am level 70+; I have launched nukes, played in nuked areas and I am still using all non legendary weapons. 
---
&gt; You are profiting off of a license for a game that was given specific terms of use which are being broken, so the game company is entitled to damages of a minimum of the amount sold.
---
That's not "against the law".  Selling virtual items for real world currency, against the ToS, will not land you in jail.  So, it is not illegal.
---
It does mean that if Bethesda bans your account, and terminates your access to the game, you have very little chance of successfully suing Bethesda for the monetary loss of what you paid for the game and the loss of your business.
---
It also opens you up to civil litigation and the possibility of further monetary losses, if Bethesda can show that they were financially damaged by your actions.  Without a competing service that sells caps, it might be a little hard for Bethesda to do so.  If Bethesda sold caps in the Atom store, it would be a slam dunk for them.  Without that, they would have to draw a reasonable link between you selling caps and a decline in game sales.
---
It should also be pointed out that Bethesda probably has at least one attorney, if not several, on retainer.  While your average cap seller probably has none.  Defending yourself from a civil suit can be very expensive.  Even if the suit is ultimately won or thrown out by a judge, the monetary loss can be crippling.  So, Bethesda doesn't need to actually win the suit, if their goal is just to financially punish you.
---
You could claim that all that means you're in legal trouble.  However, "legal trouble" and "illegal" are two different things.
---
Why do you defend it so forcefully, i never said it's a bad thing. And comparing a grognak or a whore costume to these weirdo skins is just stupid. And their price tells you everything about the greedy shitheads at bethesda
---
LOL. No, you need to be level 30 for the Perk to be available. Not your INT has to be 30.
---
Perks have level requiremnets too.
---
There's a scanner at the end of the Garrahan Mining HQ
---
what button is that?
---
Yes.  Diseased cranberries are all over Cranberry Bog.  Normal cranberries are in the northwest area of the map.  I don't know how far south they extend, but there's more than just a few in the northwest area.
---
Are there more infos about it? I can imagine you get vending machines for your camp. 
---
Hey, don't you dare call the [Garb of Mysteries](https://imgur.com/gXawftK) ugly! It's fabulous! 
---
Does it play the guitar riff though?!
---
I like this
---
Or have a hub with Graham or an assistant running it
---
I'm currently dealing with the same thing, was there any info you found out.

Is there many recipes that increase str and/or carry cap?, I find it handy for when I'm just over the limit and fast travelling back to camp, thanks

It's in the room adjacent to the terminal you got the plans from. 
---
It would, some areas have randomised mobs (or a pool at least) but for example some places always have the same
---
Jess commented that it would be Hotfixed today. 
---
Well fusion generator isn't particular expensive. When the old kind of camp placement was effective, where you could lose your camp by someone elses camp, I remember when I saw first power box near whitespring station, I thought it was IQ test. Surprisingly never saw a camp there, it was all about the golf course.
---
Right  next to the place you build it, I missed it too :-)
---
Dear Bethesda, could you spend more than 5 minutes considering your core UI choices? 
---
Thanks, a big fan of your shit when it's playable.
---
There are great locations everywhere. I don't even know where to start. It depends on which area you want your CAMP I guess. Then you can narrow it down from there. 
---
I think it’s unique for Black Diamond, as it’s a quest reward, but I may be wrong.
---
Wash your hands wastelander! 
---
That would be even worse lol. Wandering around the map looking for unmarked camps that *might* have a vendorbot, that then *might* have something for sale, that *might* not be crap.
---
Things like that are just random world items.  Anytime you enter a house or building that has a kitchen area make sure you check the counter tops.  That's the most common area to find cooking recipes.  They can be found in other places around the world too.  The Whitespring Resort has a chef who sells recipes for 120 each that I had never seen as world drops though.
---
Are these discos all from Dupers moving their shit or something else?
---
I watched two dupers near the Overseers camp and every time they would drop a bag it would lag like hell.
---
There is a skate blade mod. I had one and got rid of it because I found the ski sword with it and when I scrapped it learned it.

Just had some people roll up and launch about 5 mini nukes and flatten my friends base racking up a 400 cap bounty. Then quickly server hop. Like why?

Do we? I wouldn't know, I spend much of my game time rearranging furniture.

I see the children of atom made it down the country roads.

It would be nice if they also added some of the radio songs to the jukebox. It is by far one of my fav c.a.m.p. decorations but the fact it only plays like three (classical)songs gets old fast. Every time I load in running to the jukebox to turn it off is getting old real fast. Also switches/sirens/terminal not resetting when coming back to c.a.m.p. would also help....
---
I’ve seen it at the Watoga train station.
---
True my base always has glowing radtoads there when i fast travel to camp and the occasional supermutant pack stumbles upon or a ghoul pack
---
Literally just saw one at the vendor in Harper’s Ferry.
---
Depends on which flux the ammo takes. If it’s an easy one then I’d say very good.  Does a good bit more damage to scorched, scorch beasts and the queen. Only issue is the Ultracite ammo requirement. The combos to make ammo produce significantly more than the non Ultracite versions so if you can come by flux easily then you can actually craft Ultracite easier than regular ammo.
---
Ok will do, thanks!
---
I thought it had something to do with Site Alpha but since it was a little ways away, I didn't know for sure. I wonder if it actually shows the nuke leaving the tube then. Thank you!

Head directly south from Vault 76 and there's a lake with all three plants that you need for disease cure - with green thumb, it has everything you need.
---
If they put the stores at whitesprings they would make it into a safe zone that you can't nuke (like the starting area), and I'm sure the load times and servers will be more stable by the time they implement vending.
---
Completely understand on the RR side of things I forgot to mention my strength sits at 15 so I don't use the PA as a form of carry Weight reduction if anything it really just adds to my weight by ten and I have to constantly repair legs, the curiosity does come from whether or not the effect stacks if I was to say have a full set of armor with various weight reduction modifiers for weapon weight. That way I could play around with my build a bit more and have some diversity on other pieces of armor and perk card selection. 
---
Well you got the grey aliens in fallout 1 and 2 though iirc. Although fallout 1 featured them as an Easter egg so take it with a grain of salt. 
---
Chally the Ox-tioneer ?
---
New to online gaming- I keep reading about duper’s- what are they?  And why do they make the server crash?  And what is the point? 
---
Lol sure why not
---
i havent dabbled in flux yet im guessing whitesprings flux is easiest
---
Mine likes to Target grenades
---
They will appear as per say "legendary charred ghoul *** " or "legendary watoga defender bot * " 
---
Mood
---
I've seen most of them bugged. They deliver a lot of power when the plant is fixed, but most of time they don't react to the plant being fixed. Haven't checked them in few patches though.
---
Mine is -1 in my inventory too. 
---
This explains a lot, didn't think about it being a bug. Hehe
---
Ok, understood. Talking about selling the plans - do I get it right that it’s not possible to sell any plans to Vendor Bots? All this only between players?
---
Right just the version that matches the wetsuit is in right now. 
---
true, better than no explosion
---
Yes but the ammo recipes require specific ones. If whatever prime weapon you are using requires the flux made from the 1000 plants around whitesprings you are in good shape. If it requires cobalt or violet then your availability may go down depending on where you run nukes.
---
What is FUD?
---
Check the spot I mentioned above; there's also a spawn point in watoga. Do a Google search, I saw a few different videos. 
---
The buzz blade is in the Game Guide. I've never seen one myself, but I've seen mods for them.
---
Well, my build revolves around Lone Wanderer so I'm not inclined to accept random invites anyway, but to be honest, even if I was, I'd turn down anyone with 88 in their username automatically. 
---
To be clear, I'm not implying anything about you personally here, I'm sure its just unfortunate coincidence, but "88" is a common neo-nazi code. You see it all the time in their screen-names and gamertags, and I'd rather not even accidentally associate with someone like that.
---
When you are running FO76 with anything higher than 60 Hz, have you noticed if the game crashes to desktop more frequently?
---
I haven't had any issues getting a solid 120 fps, but when the refresh rate is set above anything higher than 60 Hz FO76 crashes to desktop anywhere between 1 minute and an hour for me.
---
On PS4 I have been experiencing a lot more crashes than disconnects, but the crashes happen randomly while I'm moving through the wasteland. I usually get 1 or 2 crashes per 3-4 hour session on a good day
---
Because Bethesda always uses error free Dara and code in Fallout 76?
---
I checked some of the files myself, and they are a shining example of standard outsourced development quality control (pure shite)
---
Yep, it's a pain in the ass when you are the sniper build trying to fire off rounds in VATS but keep targeting other players instead of the scorchbeast.  Especially when I have the scorchbeast marked with a recon scope.
---
I do not understand why they wrote it that way and it kills like any chance of getting it added.
---
For now. They said a hotfix will roll out soon, no worries hopefully will have some new content soon. Go check out the fissure sites! They have all closed up for the most part. 
---
Nope, and it's terrible.
---
But wait, there's less! It's also the case that the plan name, the name of the object(s) that show up in your CAMP building menu, and the actual function of the object can be three completely separate and unrelated things!
---
Don't act now -- operators are not standing by! If you Inspect a plan instead of getting a description of what it can be used for, or a picture of the thing it can build, or even an indication of whether this is a mod, a base item, a CAMP item or something else -- you get a useless picture of the plan itself!
---
Ignore that number on your screen, because otherwise you might start to wonder why Plans and Recipes are the only pieces of paper in the game that weigh a quarter of a pound! So if you were thinking of toting your plan collection around so that you can hand off those useless duplicates that you bought accidentally to lower level folks who might really appreciate them, then suck it, do-gooder! (Sure, you can run into people and ask them to come back to your CAMP to look at your etchings, but that's super-sketchy.)
---
As a bonus, if you think about it RIGHT NOW, you can start to wonder why a society that can teach people to build fusion reactors out of random garbage they've scavenged from the mini-mart can't figure out how to construct a working Xerox machine.
---
This happens a lot with madden, every youtuber advertises places to buy mut coins, so I dont think anything will be done against it
---
Sunday Brothers Cabin, just west of Harper's Ferry, in the shed with a generator and some workbenches. 
---
Because laughs.
---
I didn't mean I thought it was physically impossible, I meant how would you do it
---
Sorry to hear that - I guess 2/3 need to wait for „tomorrow“ or whatever forced meme Bethesda is using to downplay the problem 
---
clearly not everyone wants it, since i dont.
---
So what's new?
---
No, my father has two shotguns one two shot and one normal and the two shot has twice the damage number
---
Thanks! Sounds like the perfect time for ultracite ores
---
Not broken, Beth disabled them. Hotfix coming soon and hopefully new content along with it. Check out the fissure sites they've been closed as well for the time being. 
---
This is what I don’t understand. Last night I faced off against a level 80 scorchbeast while I’m at level 60. My weapons only chipped away, little by little, at its health. I was able to beat it with some help/distractions from the Whitesprings robots and some cover from one of the buildings. I can only craft my rifles up to level 50. How is a weapon 30 levels below an adversary seam logical?
---
This system is in faxt auto griefing. I had a PvP encounter yesterday. It was two level 120 against me, level 150. They initiated the fight, I died 6 times, they died 10 times, I lost over a thousand caps in that encounter, and they also destroyed my base - but not when we fought, they did it after I did not seek revemge anymore, and got absokutely no wanted status.
---
I was reluctant to call anything in this game completely broken, but current PvP definitely is.
---
Thanks for this! I love how dedicated people are to this game!
---
An interactive version would be amazing for us colourblind folk😅👍🏻
---
I have no doubt the effects would stack, it’s just whether they add or not. 2 x 20% reductions could be 40% if they add, or 36% if they don’t. At lower levels of reduction it wouldn’t be as noticeable, but with each additional same effect you would get progressively smaller returns. 5x20% for example diminishes down to 68% instead of 100% if that’s how they work.
---
As someone who has ignored this event I will. Ow check this out. Thanks for the tip. 
---
It all has to start somewhere.
---
I server hopped so much for those Excavator Shocks. 
---
I dont think I have seen a T51 shock. 
---
Agreed - just wish you could see the numeric value of it, somehow (armor penetration that is).
---
Once all the duping is over, I won’t mind it going to even 100 
---
You cant see me with my super awesome Blackbird paint.....
---
That's kind of my point haha
---
I would also add that it should show either via color change or with a 
---
small text bubble under it if you are broadcasting in team or area...
---
Also on PC a key binding for switching between auto/team/area would be nice too! 
---
ATTENTION all miner miracles gamers, to register your spiffy new PA you just need to send me your credit card #, the 3 digits on the back and exp date/year, so you can get back to Appalachia and survive the fallout!
---
It was super mutants for me...
---
I now envy you.
---
I hate the server set up, let us pick a dedicated server and have it be our permanent home.  It is impossible to build a relationship with server mates when every session is a new batch of players.  Also it would make things like powering up the plants or just general progression around the world mean more.  And last I wouldnt lose my shit including my daily quest progress because of glitches.  Keep the session hopping an option but lets us pick a dedicated server too.
---
Sadly same way in reverse too. I head to Watoga for some laid back xp and legendary farming and find the whole place is full of lvl 14-34 enemies due to one low level being there.
---
Doesn't Whitesprings get nuked a lot? I always see the large nuclear blast radius circle centered on whitesprings or fissure prime. 
---
Only if they can snap together unlike in FO4, and will adjust to uneven terrain unlike FO4 or FO76.  
---
Man level 100 armor and weapons sounds amazing.
---
Sadly it doesnt sound like duping will be over anytime soon.
---
I rarely  use PA, I'd love some armor where I can go into a nuke zone without worries.
---
Fear uncertainty doubt
---
Of course. It would make the game much more appealing to higher level players, but there's probably some technical reason why it cant be done.
---
I got lucky with the 1st one and never found the 2nd one.  I only recall seeing torso and head mods for the T51.
---
I loved Travis. Especially since hes so damn annoying at first but if you help him get confident he becomes really nice to listen to.
---
Yesssss. Fed up of facing an enemy, hitting VATS, then magically spinning around to target a player/friendly bot etc.
---
I had this too but only one, I even tried fadt travelling ahead of it and managed two bursts before it wad gone again. I have since downed 5 using recon sniper rifles and auto handmade rifles. 
---
Holy molly, hell no! That would destroy builds. It will never come to the game. No chance.
---
I found that platform too. To the south west of The Crosshair. It was very odd. Like one of those honesty stands you see outside farms where you put money in a box and take eggs, vegetables and jam. Except here, you get skulls. Yay.
---
Hate train is gonna Chu Chu and we are going to play play.
---
I would like vendor camps. They could make markers for camps with vending which let you fast travel there for free. Otherwise you're right I guess. 
---
You want fallout 4 content?
---
Wouldn’t be surprised if they charged atom for junk (walls) 
---
You got deathclaws, lucky :)  I did that one at the same spot and got like 3 ferals.
---
People exploiting an item duplication glitch. It is a big part of the servers  not working properly.
---
I have furious handy with 3 2h perks at 1 star each. It is amazing.
---
I think that sounds like a good start but I have no ideas what it would look like.
---
I have 5 luck and I dunno whether it actually benefits or not
---
Totally sexy emus, they're way too powerful
---
I also SUPER love how L5 enemies (Super Mutants, Scorched, Liberators) have more range than my Heavy Laser, Missile, and Heavy Machine Gun turrets (and yes, turrets are elevated, I have Spotlights).
---
I've come back many times to CAMP, only to find tons of damage, and a L5 enemy plinking away, and my turrets (those not destroyed) just sitting around (powered, but not firing).
---
Well then I stand corrected 
---
Seriously though, they cant really. Some people will have bought Atoms to buy it and as it was listed as 1 day only it would be mis selling.
---
I luckily had  saved all my Atoms from normal progression and saw a post on Twitter so bought it.
---
I was surprised, I thought itd be just one deathclaw, then I was getting like 2-3 per wave 
---
I'd like to be able to make dirty water and not have to click on the stupid water well each time.
---
Perks, grouping aswell as tailored number crunches, i do agree guns are weak AF compared to how fast they degrade even with appropriate perks setup. The game just naturally favours melee builds, only way to change it is if a certain special stat would increase the damage modifier, say strength on melee as an example. If perception did rifles, agility did pistols, intelligence did explosives/energy etc
---
Scorched were never intended to be an easy kill though, even at level 1 they’re at level 50 just to emphasise.
---
A false message to sow Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.  If you use a debugger and modify the executable or memory related to the game you may get banned, but you will not get banned from any mods you find on Nexus mods
---
Depends on what you're looking for. I would add Harper's Ferry to your jump list. 
---
Yeah Fallout 76 violates the canon pretty hard. Power armor is now apparently stupidly common.
---
You da real MVP! Have a Karma! 
---
The brotherhood demands your supplies you’re all insignificant 
---
Ad victoriam
---
(At the same time somewhere else in the world, a cloning vat opens)
---
„G-Gary?“
---
Yea well I know this and having tested it a lot I felt a extra little bit would help since even with all this we have found some ways to 1 shot or 2 shot people.
---
So handy and chainsaws don't seem to be effected by slugger weirdly enough
---
Isn't that the pulp fiction quote. The one that Samuel L Jackson uses?
---
Recipes that use purified water should be 30-50% more beneficial.
---
So like...I know I'm married...but...that description...
---
...no!  I must resist!
---
I see no mention of sweet roll here, but I always look out for the ingredients (sugar, sugar bombs, spices, purified water iirc). It gives 3 charisma, which (along with grape tats) helps me get over that threshold from 1 to 2 caps for certain common items, which is double profit.
---
Side note:
---
It may also allow perk sharing at a higher level. I know that CHA debuffs will stop you sharing new cards, but I don’t know if that happens with already shared cards (think not) or if CHA buffs will allow sharing better cards.
---
It might be possible to buff CHA, share a good card, and keep sharing it after the buff wears off. 
---
Did you put the red nose of that radstag? HOW did you change the colors on the lights? Terminal ?
---
Had a similar issue with shotgun spread with the white spring bots yesterday.
---
Don’t forget awol armaments I always get a 3 star for the last mob 
---
I just server hopped Watogo station and Phoenix for about 30 minutes until I found them 
---
You do,periodically have to put the main quest on hold to level up a bit. If you're at level 17 I'd suggest doing some exploration/questing in the  Toxic Valley and Ash Heap regions.
---
Given how expensive ultracite ammo is, it's still not viable. Even if ultracite ammo is 10 times better than regular ammo, I'd still rather fire 10 additional 5.56 shots than a single 5.56 ultracite shot because normal ammo is so easy to craft compared to ultracite.
---
People that duplicate weapons/items in game. Like most online open world games the number of items per player can be taxing. When 2 players try to duplicate the server start getting connection issues sometimes. Eventually leading to all players getting kicked of that server at one point.
---
Why they do it? Greed and stupidity. People sell weapons items on the internet. I really do not know why though since the amount of caps you have doesn't really matter. Once you get to a certain lvl below 50 having caps is a nonissue. Also the endgame content is not that hard plus the useful legendary mods just make the whole game trivial. Even if duping wasnt a issue the game economy would not be a good one to sustain trading etc between players. So duping makes it even less enjoyable for people that actually want to play a trader.
---
So just a bunch of greedy douches to be quite honest.
---
Dupers are players who use and exploit in game that allows them to duplicate items by crashing the server. A lot of them then try to sell the items for either real money or in game caps. 
---
When they crash the server it can corrupt quests or you can loose items/xp you gained up to 5 or 10 mins  before the crash. Either way it can make the game unplayable if you end up on their server.
---
Grafton: BoS armor, lever action rifle plans
---
Camden: excavator mods

Enclave: x-01 mods

**WEST VIRGINA**
---
Balance is already broken and no way to repair.  We will begin again on private servers. Just as always community saves this game. Consider current gameplay as beta.
---
Yeah you and me both, worth every penny too; loved and used it constantly along with that Captain Cosmos and the Settlement Ambush Kit (for those sexy walls). I was disappointing with the fact Slocum's Joe also had no interior but there is always hope for future content being added.
---
Geez. Isn't just playing easier than that? I legit get wanting to boost some levels early on but crafting XP is so low that just seems absurdly inefficient. I guess unless he's using macros and the character is never meant to really be played.
---
Happened to me too. The traitor. I scrapped it and replaced it, but the new one hardly shot anything after that, even when enemies were actively attacking me. It was almost like it knew what happened to the old one and was sulking.
---
Just so you're aware, you keep calling them "settlements" which is likely confusing people because that's not what they're called. They're "workshops."
---
Ooooh. Just literally stand on a rooftop or somewhere with a bird's eye view, and occasionally throw a taunt emote to let them know.... ugh, I can feel the satisfaction just thinking about wrecking some cheeky gip!!
---
Don't have to wait long for defense spawns either, 10 mins of your patience *could* result in free workshop stuff.
---
It's literally just a mole rat aimbot for me because otherwise I spend 2 hunting rifle clips to hit one lmao
---
On paper asnin write them down? On paper?
---
They should just make it so you can upgrade every item to a higher level through crafting. Then, that would also include unique items by default.
---
You unlocked something dif. I promise. 
---
Those metal cabinets, the kitchen tables, and the rustic tables set.. I have none of them, yet bought them multiple  times now. It's infuriating. OH and the benches. Fuck those benches. 
---
I found one in the wild. I think it was in the dumping site near West Tek. If you're on PS4, I can sell it to you for 100 caps since it's of no use for me (I only kept it just in case for things like these. One man's trash is another man's treasure.)
---
im working on it i dont have any experience with java script so it might be awhile but i do have experience with c++ and java is my next course in programming XD
---
Crit savvy, better crits in luck tree are a god send. Couple those with some overdrive and you become a killing machine
---
Not true. Mystery quest items are still quite strong, and all rise is still used by many high level players.
---
Yes, asnin paper and pencil.
---
tyvm good sir
---
LMAO that I did
---
I would like the icon because it helps me know when to mute myself due to background noise in my house while wearing headphones. I can’t hear it but the mic picks it up. 
---
What was that planned named and what other info do you have on it? Location? That is the one I've been hunting for weeks now. 
---
Hahahahaha
---
I saw one that was Jet Black sweet looking one. I also saw another that was black but had an ultracite glow in certain spots. In a pattern not just random spots. It was awesome looking too. I have all the armors including X01 and the Ultracite and none looked like these. 
---
These skins I saw were not default ones. I am on pS4 so it isn’t a mod I wouldn’t think. Both times I asked these players point blank where did you get the skin for your power armor. Neither responded. If anyone has info I would love to know. 
---
this explains so much!  thanks!
---
But I need reminded often of the depressing situation of company stores and mining 16 tonnes.
---
Remove legendary weapons completely for equal chances for casual players
---
Even better, feel free to just poke any of the spawns yourself too and let them do all that cleanup work in the process and get your free loot to make up for the annoyance. 
---
There's ways to deal with everything, if you just use your head a bit. 
---
And becauae VATS has this weird trick of making you run TOWARDS the highlighted enemy, the grenade is 100% hitting you in the melon!
---
I'm not trying to defend dupers but they're not the only reason servers are bad. 
---
theres a farm to the northwest of vault 76 that has bout 10 plants of mutfruit
---
 When one shotted, legendaries may drop their loot on the ground. Most of the times you kill a 3* and has no loot, check nearby and you'll find something
---
I'm with you with the exception of armor/weapon durability stuff.  Weight reduction stuff is equipped now on me 100% of the time.  3 points in agi, 10 in str, 3 in int.  
---
For armor, white night and fix it good make repairing armor cheap enough to 200% and since it lasts twice as long I don't feel like I need to keep them equipped.  Plus the DR/ER goes up over 100%.
---
For weapons, weapon artisan making it 200% also helps.  It's not quite as cheap but still, 200% lasts longer so it's effectively cheaper.
---
Wow.
---
It's pretty easy to get that stuff at the various Reddit markets.
---
Not worth it to do things like that.
---
So the easy lockpick mod that shows exactly where the sweetspot is so you never ever break a lockpick is fine? 
---
Great news!
---
&gt; So I'd like to ask all the American players here, is grieving a problem in US?
---
Not at all. I've had zero problems with griefing in game.  Probably perception bias on your part?  How many people have attacked your camp AND had a mic AND said something while doing it?  
---
Also, it's interesting to identify people by accent, as we have plenty of Americans with Irish accents. Whatever accents...accents from all over the world. Just because someone has a certain accent doesn't mean they are or aren't from a certain part of the world.
---
&gt;I'm Irish, most of the players in my world are Irish 
---
I'm also curious about this part. When you pick a server, does it automatically attempt to put you on a server based on your geography? Otherwise, how would you know the nationality of people on your server, especially since they aren't static. Each time you log in, you're logging into someplace new.
---
Agreed, Harper's Ferry is pound for pound best vendor for armor plans, mods.
---
&gt; they could have even given one of the modders $1000 and used their fix and not had to create anything.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; but they never did...
---
No company would do this. Why would anyone do this? They exist to make money, not pay someone for an easy fix.
---
There was a lot wrong with the Junk Walls, but I still like them. But you're right, if they can't be buried in the terrain they'd be pretty useless.  I used to use the pillar glitch and mat glitch to position them nicely. Would that be too much of a burden on the servers (assuming many people used them)?
---
Camp locks don't keep teammates out
---
Unfortunally I'm on PC. But thanks for the offer 
---
With great difficulty - since Windows updates broke my mic and there's no text chat in the game.  C'mon Bethesda, add the text chat already.
---
Eh, I don't think the game is suffering from a lack of this. I don't see it as adding something unique to the game. But just idea's other games have used. 
---
And there would still be lots of complaints about having to switch out perks. 
---
Got a 2 shot, still sucks though.... better available.
---
tried to do this event last night,  couldn't fast travel to it,  so fast traveled to nearby location, then it bugged out and every time we walked into the event area the event icon on the compass disappeared and nothing happened :(
---
Sad thing is that you wouldn't even come close even if you had 2000 of those to sell.
---
Nah... I think those who got it should be rewarded by being smart enough to buy it. 
---
Nah, I'm great on some suck at piano, they are in groups I believe.  Found this out day one when I left my guy jamming for an hour in the vault while I got kids at school, got back and he could actually play lol.
---
Dropped $20 for it because I'm a edgelord and then immediately sought out the red lamp for my X-01.
---
Issue is i barely have the caps to buy one back, unless someone wants to give me a deal for it
---
*sigh*
---
fuck sake
---
I've actually been wondering if area is broken on Xbox as I am on area and speak to people all the time but never get a response.
---
Teaming up seems to be broken too as a lot of the time it says "Player not accepting team invites right now" - Tried teaming with a guy last night and we were both getting this. 
---
Excavator?  I could give it a try but I seriously doubt if I'm going to get lucky.  Maybe, maybe...
---
Has Bethesda said they will or will not increase the level cap with expansions?
---
Look at these peasents with their tricenttinal  ;D
---
It's a bug I suppose.
---
Threw out my auto grenade launcher cause of it.
---
Certainly not the fact that I blow myself up a lot with it as well.  Nope.
---
&gt;It's a vault designed to experiment on people in the event of nuclear war. 
---
FTFY. 
---
Also if you've been paying attention to the Overseers logs and other information you'd know that things are *a lot* worse on the outside of the vaults than expected. There are many, many things that Vault-tec didn't or couldn't account for. 
---
I’ve got one violet if you can find another, had a spare from my decon arch. Happy to trade for some mats, I’m out of rubber. 
---
good to know. what about corn soup. if i were herbivore would i get a bonus for the water consumption as well. because that would be worth it right there. one corn soup to fill up food and water bar 60+/-
---
Got it....
---
*do i have to be unarmed to headbutt players?*
---
But seriously, excellent way to get XP and some loot too. 
---
Just got a .44 3star revolver. I'm not speced into pistols but keep your chin up and do the events. The horde events seem to drop legendary stuff but it's mostly wood armor. Keep looking
---
I haven't got the slightest idea.
---
I Agree, it still counts as cache space, just let us show it off....and Atom Cats paint jobs...
---
I agree; there would need to be multiple shards of course because there are a ton of players. It could be similar to The Farm in Destiny 2, but with player run shops similar to Ragnarok or other MMOs.
---
Nope. Scrapped about another 100. No unlocks. 
---
We all want this.. but it would affect camp budget and camp size lol.
---
It's listed under items that increase AP.  I didn't go into items that increase stats since there's so many that do that.
---
Definitely don't have either of these problems on the Xbox in America. Although, I would like to find the remaining pieces to a 51b, so that I can finish the Nuka Cola paint.  However, lots of crashes and hard locks of the game... Lol
---
Mh how i'll be lucky then :/
---
I found them on a table at horizons rest. The uphill part. Xbox
---
YES PLEASE. I have so badly wanted to build glass wall openings in my CAMP
---
My god a reasonable request what a concept
---
Mitty?
---
also that mountain to the east of the ordnance works with the 2 mutfruit spawns has 3 starlight creepers also has a junk pile but for some reason cant place a camp there 
---
What! But this is Reddit! I thought you could only post actual facts here...are you seriously suggesting someone made something up! :)
---
Does anyone know if this has been resolved yet?
---
I would definitely go back to playing the game if being level 100 mattered, what's the point of being level 100 if a level 50 can have the same quality of gear as me? Shouldn't I be benefited for the extra time I put into the game?
---
I got the plan for the BOS chest mod last night in watoga, level 181
---
makes sense to add in pvp here but if you aren't going to one shot them i don't think it would have a place in pvp. most pvp builds with a standard 2 hander will 1 shot most players. that's got to be your goal or you're at a huge disadvantage. however... filling them up very quickly with will screw them over quite a bit. i'll test it with you, add me on pc!
---
Yes it is as the code stands right now.
---
Yeah here's the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abis05/have_they_broken_nukes_y2k/ed1m0i3/
---
Of pacifist mode was like grandma you wouldn't be able to hurt enemies that aren't human too. Bad idea. Gta online sucked with the greifing. 
---
You are only at a disadvantage in your own head. There's no leaderboards (Thank god), so there's no real competition.
---
As he pointed out, this is a co-op survival game. Which is the first principal when they design things, with the idea that some players will want to go it alone.
---
It's your choice to play the game solo. And that means you have to deal with how the game works when you are playing a co-op game in a way it wasn't optimily designed for. 
---
Someone else asked about that in another comment and I listed all recipes (that I have at least) that increase STR or carry weight.  Someone mentioned that some of these will stack, but I've never checked that myself.
---
I agree, in their current state they're negative fun for both sides.
---
I got a lot! Still want to buy? 
---
Oh my bad, I didn’t see it. Didn’t know it increased AP either! Great write-up.
---
I must say I haven't touched FO76 since Dec 17th (had to RMA my CPU) but up to that day I haven't seen any crash to desktop at all. I had the game process hang once at most, up to the point I had to kill the game, but that was right after release.
---
R1700 stock, GTX 1070, Windows 10 - what are your specs more or less?
---
I usually throw together a set of level appropriate gear, couple cosmetics, good fire axe and maybe a gun or ammo, just general use items for a supply drop. If I had a mic, I’d ask what they need, but with no text chat it’s difficult to mime out stuff. 
---
Most of fissures I went too have Yao Gai and death claws corpses if you’re looking for quick materials. Do you have any idea when “soon” is?
---
&gt;I'm on wired gigabit, and my PC is a high-end gaming rig.
---
What's between you and the servers also matter. It's not just what's sitting in your living room, unfortunately.
---
Looks like you owe a super mutant a ton of caps
---
Thank you!! I'll prolly post on fallout market when I get home. Get 2 violet and about 10 crimson. Hopefully super duper is nice to me and I can get around 1K ammo crafted up for it. Actually, I hope they fix nukes bc I really need to get my violet flux back right. Usually keep 10 of each but someone was doing ultracite shocks for a decent price yesterday so my 10 violet got used. 
---
Yes, yes you should.
---
Im level 82, I'm enjoying  the game. I been hanging with lower levels, helping them out.
---
I still need to launch a nuke. Met some nice people people
---
Try clearing out a workshop (to claim it) that has turrets, as a sniper.
---
Yes, yes game, I did want to VATS on the broken gun emplacement 3 feet behind me, not the super mutant standing on the roof of the building.
---
They're christmas items.
---
Agree, weapons cases and mountings would be nice.

There are so many things that can be added to a live service Fallout game. Patience though is difficult.
---
That's why I never trust anyone! xD
---
Especially in video games. People whip out their inner asshole real quick!
---
You can have pets?!  The things I don't know yet.
---
Not sure what you mean by separate cells. After a loading screen? if so I'm not sure about that, but when you're outside in Appalachia new drops of water still appear whenever you're in a building
---
They didn't *fix* it yet, but they did *say* they're going to fix it - the fix for lever action rifles sounds to be intended for the first January patch (I'd guess next week, but they haven't given any dates or even indications of when as of yet).
---
The game makes the game unstable.
---
Sorry to hear about your bad timing, though.
---
Once, my GPS somehow got reversed! North is South. East is West.

RECRUITMENT BLUES DISAPPEARED 
---
So I was playing recruitment blues I’d finished basic training and had gone to the dmv to get the Military ID, I’d just been told to get a stamp or something and the game kicked me out 
---
When I logged back on the quest had gone 
---
Went back to the camp and it said pass basic training but when I spoke to the master sergeant he’d said I’d already done it
---
Is the game now fucked for me? 
---
yeah, I should have known better
---
&gt;but it is clearly happening to a lot of people
---
Is it, though? Do you have anything to substantiate this besides seeing posts on Reddit? And what constitutes "a lot"?
---
Exacly it would free up some space in cashe and allow friends and other player to see your awsome collection of power armour. I currently own the X-01 and ultracite PA and i would like to own one of each or multiple ones of each  but i dont have space. It would be cool to show off a collection of PA with different paint jobs ect
---
Hey, I took some pics! Maybe not the most advanced or stylish CAMP out there, but I'm proud of it! https://imgur.com/a/FAqjG1c
---
But think about how quick you could get a round in!
---
Drill can get an armor piercing mod, at the very least. Been wanting to try this out myself before Bethesda changes it.
---
why did you grab the pie before making the video
---
Why couldn't they exactly? Even if they waited 6  months to bring it back they could still say it was a limited offer. Do the same thing of only having 24hrs to purchase. More people would spend money now that they are aware of it, thus funding more DLC content later. If you spent money on Atoms previously why should that have any impact on me wanting to do so now or later for the same or similar item. Unless of course they lowered the cost...but I'm not asking for that. 
---
TSE &gt; melee right now.
---
Sure, you can one shot a mob.
---
I can one shot a horde.
---
Nah Just make them passively effect your stash
---
i keep seeing people posting about not repairing armor. Im lvl 30 and all my pieces have legendary effects and i keep repairing them. Am i doing something wrong?
---
Canvas
---
Thanks.  The 188 Trade post, yep that sort of place, has easy access, do a bit of trading, for a few hours maybe.   Maybe just a few tents would be enough to kick start.
---
this is a voice over pete joke don't actually do this lmao for downvoting
---
There’s also a boiler in the basement of the Overlook cabin. Thats from the book. 
---
"Non Power attacks should cost AP"
---
No. This is absurd and akin to saying that pulling the trigger on your gun should cost AP
---
Also as far as the grapple mechanic, Death Claw, Yao Guai, Scorchbeast, Wendingo, and most other high level enemy's all have a disorienting attack that stuns you in some way. Normal enemies should not be able to do anything worse than the high level enemy's stuns.
---
The radio array.  These 3 have been my daily triad for screws/springs for a good while before I got to the endgame farm.
---
Been to the science vendor a lot and never seen an XCell plan. maybe check the wiki
---
It's easy. If you take another player's loot, you get flagged as hostile.
---
I'm ill about people taking my stuff and then sitting there taking slap before just disconnecting.
---
That’s fucked up, let me see if I have one, though I don’t think so.
---
So they give us a tiny increase in camp budget or make it so PA doesnt effect camp budget at all
---
&gt;Im not trying to be a jerk, but I'm an industry vet of over 25 years, and what it looks like to me is that they're either taking a nap, too burnt out and don't care, or they're completely inept.
---
Submit your resume? I'm sure they'd love someone on the team who could fix all these glaring issues in a week.
---
Yeah I saw it, didn't recognize it from FO4 and was SO STOKED....found all the tokens I could, tried that...nothing....found a bunch of pre-war money to try...nothing...tried putting that in the token machines (maybe she just wanted fresh tokens)...nothing.
---
If this isn't updated with some kind of content some day I will be so sad because it is so COOL. +_+
---
Most likely server maintenance. This happened to me last weekish.
---
That's really cool! :0
---
Infact I just looked it up, the effect will not apply to anything that does not have the V96PreyKeyword, so basically outside of Vault96 it has zero purpose.
---
Flatwoods would be best, it starter area n no enemies n in a safe zone, it would make sense if we rebuilt the first town we visited 
---
If you would, I gladly buy it from you. I have some items for it to push up the price which i may lack in caps.
---
I have a bloodied explosive gat I recently got off SBQ so now I need 14 levels to make it shine.
---
True there is lagg/desync from time to time. But when I get the connection input error message its dupers most of the time if you ask me.
---
Every time I see the message my first reaction is opening the map and look for 2 or more people doing nothing close to each other in the middle of nowhere. More than once when I went to them they were not at a camp or even muted me for the session. (unable to see them on map). Honestly, there is not much you can do to stop them. I have gone loose on a few once with auto gl launcher. Just ends up making me wanted etc.
---
There's notes on the inside the vault website
---
No, you're the only one.
---
That's unfortunate; could just as easily be the year they were born...
---
Damn thats fckn messed up man. I would help if i could but i only have a two shoot lever action as an extra.. not as good as ur TsE
---
Awesome thanks, I need to start looking out for them in that case. I have almost certainly been walking right by them and not picking them up.
---
Super mutants realistically could have existed with Vault 87 being pre-war, but having west-tek in WV is an easier way of explaining it
---
Because if they did it wouldn't only be available for the specified time, it's lying...
---
Correct.

Well, maybe not Cheat Engine specifically, "third party applications". A bethesda community lead confirmed here that mods were not the target. 
---
&gt;Even then, it is highly impractical to use anyway, you either need some elevation or a jetpack
---
If you have Marsupial all you need is the slightest oncline to get that braced fall animation; it's annoying as fuck.
---
Thx, i'm on XB1X
---
It's risk versus reward. An enemy has an easier chance to deal more damage to you when you're up in their face. Melee is just fine the way it is.  
---
there is a lot to like  in this , I adore the mushroom cloud heart in the background and the size disparity of the two vault dwellers .great work 
---
It has a chance of being rewarded for completing the AWOL Armanents Event at the Robco Building (between Watoga and Harper's Ferry).

Done it twice and got a Gauss Rifle and Radium Rifle.

I have a Two Shot lvl50 Radium Rifle and I really like it so I'm stuck in the same boat, currently only have a swift mag and severe receiver.
---
Vanguard combat armor / marine will give you the most resistances in the game (+35 def the higher your health). If you're not going the unyielding (low health route), vanguard would proly be your best bet. 
---
I hear you on that, I resorted to buying flux for my arch with the nukes down. I’ve been spending everything on care packages for lowbies over the holiday and put myself in the poor house, that flux goes real fast on shielded underarmors.

What game does end game RNG loot right?

wait why does it take so long to get boiling water? If you gather it from a lake you get one litterally like every button press you get like 50 in a matter of seconds.

my PSN is vorkot3. he unfortunately has his shit on private. I really appreciate it man.
---
Obtuse player reply warning:
---
There is voice in the game?  On Xbox as well?  I thought it was only those silly emote things.  I'm pretty solo, but voice would help for random encounters ("thanks, man, for one-shotting that boss into whom I'd already dumped 400 rounds causing 1% damage").
---
I found that tower too - sad!
---
Can we stand on it during a nuke launch? The absolute best part of Far Harbor was launching the nuke, leaving the sub, then standing there as it fires 40 feet into the ceiling of the base
---
If it's someone I don't know IRL, they aren't "my friend" even if they are on my "friends list" 
---
Trust no one.
---
yeah, it isnt labeled like T51 or X-01. It is just called Calibrated Shocks. so it is easy to miss it when you are looking for Excavator in the title
---
&gt; Since the same paints can be applied, few people will even notice its not a matched set of X-01.
---
But I'll know.
---
People can hate on our game all they want but finding a community like this is rare and wonderful
---
I dropped them in my stash.  Nice not to have scroll thru it all anymore. 
---
I agree to keep the game fun and interesting they should add pet companions, utilise the shelfs you get in c.a.m.p to store/showcase unique weapons or store them there for people to see and buy.
---
I dont think we will ever get any type of driveable vehical if im honest but would be cool to see.
---
And oh yes a working fridge to store food and plants to stop them going off that would be awsome to have
---
Think they do, I was way across the map and it let me know.....
---
Wait, when was this available and why was it for a limited time? I didn't even know this existed until now....
---
Spikes do slightly more damage but I think the bleed from the skate mod outweighs the extra Spike damage
---
Actually they are "army fatigues" and "military fatigues" one is underarmor and one is an outfit. 
---
Found it. True, spikes are better :) I thought it is some kind of top mod. Sad. But in any case ski sword is an excellent melee weapon.
---
Was it marketed as a one time offer or limited time offer? If it was one time then I guess that's fair, but if it was limited time I feel it could still come back down the line and make it just as elusive. Hell charge extra for it even. 
---
Your wish is my command

I must be blind because the inside the vault thing I keep seeing saying very little other than fluff about up coming content
---
That's why I was saying if you wanted to prestige you have that option, it's not mandatory, it's optional.
---
thx. I will Keep on trying
---
Seem stupid to increase it, tons of people are over lvl 100, even over lvl 200. 
---
What they should have done is made max lvl 50 and then increase it with expansions later on
---
Re Swamp Plant:  I got a bunch of them while picking Strangler Pods and Strangler Blooms near Dyer Chemical.  They are either a secondary item you can get from harvesting one of both of those, or they're a different plant that looks practically identical to one of those.  I'm not sure which.
---
He's role-playing as a scammer?? /s it's possible he didn't know that was unit price
---
Believe it or not, but I actually had this occur a few times in Fallout 4.  If I one shot, headshot a legendary from stealth, they wouldn't drop anything.  But, making sure you do a couple of rounds and let them regen usually meant good loot.
---
Hahahah shiiiiiiiit where was my mind!!! 2burnt4me
---
I am not familiar with the duping process, but if you wonna be just about punishing exploits, you would have to apply punishment to all kinds of exploits people committed knowingly. In that sense a huge amount of people would have to be punished.
---
People are influenced by their environments. FO76 overs an abundant amount of exploits, so the game would have to be blamed aswell.
---
Bottom line is  - FO76 needs every player it can possibly get right now and in the forseeable future. Being strict or petty would be really harmful to the shrinking community. Any tendency to being an exclusive community with harsh punishments for more or less deviant bejaviour would backfire big time.
---
And it is generally unclear, whether Bethesda has the technical means to determine/identify duped items and who created them originally. I tend to doubt that.
---
what? I've done that event on my 121 and my 89... I have NEVER gotten adds about 60 lol. Lucky. 
---
Careful, you're gonna get a flood of people telling you either you're full of it, because they don't have disconnect problems, or to stop whining because all you really lose is 5 caps (even though you clearly state the cost of ammo and etc).
---
I don't think it's workshops. Yesterday I crashed twice trying to open my map. I think this game just doodoo sometimes.
---
Enforcer cripple does the trick 
---
Its not, can be modded to any ski sword
---
Think it said 1 day only, so a second day, even much later would be dishonest I guess?
---
I usually get insects -\_\_\_-
---
This would be quite bad, too. I have several duped CAMP-Items I can't get rid off (and they even block my budget). Following a "ban all dupers" way, I would probably be banned, too.
---
Its funny when you pacify Super Mutants, you can interact with them and they say something like "Go away asshole" iirc. 
---
You can build in the 'cave' system in watoga, lots of exits
---
I agree, but this post will get down voted.  Melee is too OP.  Stealth rifle specs can be very effective, but they don't benefit from being able to handle groups very well and have ZERO foods to help our stats.  Our armor is shit and if we put on PA we lose the benefit of stealth pretty much.  Melee has 5 foods that will stack to increase melee damage by over 50%.  It's ridiculous.  Add foods that boost crit damage and bobbleheads and you've got an OP class.  You've got a build that normally needs PA so they can handle groups of mobs, tank for themselves and deal very high damage versus everyone else without the stacking food recipes or ability to take very many hits.
---
&gt; Yesterday i had a Deathclaw spawn 5 feet in front of me on a dark road.  
---
Yeah the first time I entered the Mire I learned to stay off the roads!  The first time I had a deathclaw pop up out of nowhere and kill me while I was trying to handle 5 flying bugs.  The second time I spotted 3 Yao Guai walking up the road towards me.  I moved over to the side of the road, but there was a wall there.  I was just hoping to let them walk by while I was stealthed since the fight would have been 50/50 for me to survive at that range.  BUT OH NO!  Of course a deathclaw spawns and attacks the bears.  As they all jostle around one eventually backs into me and breaks my stealth.  I could have handled the bears after I saw that I was doing decent damage to them with a shotgun, but not with the damned deathclaw.  I died that time too.  Another thing that happened after I got to around 40 or so is that I started seeing more random "large" groups of mutants (greater numbers than the 3 or 4 that you normally see) walking the roads or even in the woods.  DO NOT ATTACK THEM unless you put on PA and want to take on a dragged out fight because a scorched beast is guaranteed to show up out of nowhere.  The group is there for the scorchbeast.  If you just stand there and wait one is guaranteed to show up and attack the group.
---
You can find it in the vendor at top of the world most of the times
---
Begs the question (for which there may be an existing great answer) as to why there needs to be 2 different kinds of water ...
---
hmmm, bethesda lying...  remember the canvas bag?
---
They definitely do warn you
---
Enclave has so many vendors. My favorite thing from there is shielded underarmor. Some people will pay a lot of that but if you stick around enough you’ll get the plans
---
Grenadier doesn't help with explosive weapons 
---
i can only dream... i perfer rifles for my build, but man they are so hard to come by.  I imagine that thing melts face.
---
If you have a workshop or something and your game crashes you can reenter the server that you were playing in. Doesn't help with server crashes though
---
[My Multi-Layer-Bridgecamp xD ](https://imgur.com/a/u4j1NMT) basically a Barn with  workshopstyle connected to a party section under the bridge.
---
I guess that's fair, but it would be nice nonetheless. 
---
Let me show off all of my Atomic Shop T-51b Power Armor paints.
---
I saw a heavy rocket super sledge mod at Harper's ferry merchant.
---
There is a different bomber jacket, one that you find instead of buy and it looks like the real thing.
---
Maybe try putting down the fertilizer pile, then fence in the brahmin, then stick a pressure plate in there =P  Still if the power counters don't pulse at a certain count it wouldn't work.  I thought they did but i guess i was wrong.  Yeah they removed anything that could be used as a timer unfortunately.  I was trying to make blinking/cycling christmas lights :(
---
I hid under whatever cover I could find when I first saw it. I didn't know if it would aggro or not. 
---
True that. This community is wonderful as hell.
---
I am in the same exact boat you are in (on ps4 as well) twice in a row it's happened, after taking Poseidon power plant and the scrapyard to the sound the game blue screens before I have the chance to get back and loot for the first time. Started happening shortly after they nerfed the production rates
---
Idk about free fast travel, as that would basically make all fast travel free as people set up shops all over.
---
But definitely a little icon for camps with shops.
---
The thought is still appreciated my man.
---
If all else fails, your credit card company should refund your money.  They can take it up with Bethesda themselves.
---
Depends. I like to have max on all damage perks for the weapon I use, but some people like to be more versatile with their build. Depends on how often you want to switch perks around and what build you're going for and if you're looking to get max damage for boss fights,or are looking to explore more. 
---
You also get to pull the trigger from a safe distance. Melee tradea hits on my health for better damage up close.
---
*waves in my Blackbird power armor*
---
Might have been me. I dump unecessary stuff in cash registers all the time
---
For pure melee build I would max it, but the overkill comes from what weapon you use as well.
---
Yup. Day one bug. Still not fixed. One of the most OP guns in Fallout history, here is just broken.
---
If you do a speed run for ingredients you can whip up a crap ton of food for buffs in about 15 or 20 minutes, gain xp from crafting it, and then go kill stuff and get even more xp?? While having extra food so you don't need to use stimpaks?? And probably having extra that you can sell?? A little prep can save you plenty of time and caps in the long run.
---
Is there any proof that they were purposefully disabled and not bugged out with the new year ..?
---
No one wants to see your Power Armors, we all have them ourselfes.
---
If you want to show off, put them on.
---
It wasn't on the radio (actually I didn't check), it was next to a tent that I could see inside, but couldn't enter.  Camp Thorn I think it was.  But it was Beach Boys and it was in game.
---
Things that are rare are the most desirable, the more get it, the less want it, if everyone had it it wouldn't look cool anymore....sucks doesnt it :-)
---
When you're in a menu or crafting it sometimes doesn't pop up. 
---
Had no idea about the cranberry foods. Thank you!
---
*shoots a ranged mob with a ranged weapon and gets hit from range*
---
They sell plans at watoga a vendor bky
---
Off
---
Bravo!
---
Does it leave a "husk" like a broken wall that you're still able to interact with?  Or does it disappear like some other CAMP items?  Are you still able to store it when it gets to 0%?
---
Mic or d/L Xbox app if you dont have a keypad. It makes messaging other players easier. I've been in groups where people are shy and don't want to use mic , and chatting thru the app is much faster than hen packing through controller.
---
Ugh yes the gun emplacements &gt;.&lt;
---
That aren’t even functional in the first place.
---
Lol you're an idiot.
---
Agreed, however I feel as though we're just circling around picking at individual words rather than the overall intention of my original post.
---
I personally feel that the game needs NPC'S, currently it is too hollow and robots and holotapes don't provide enough engagement for me.
---
I am honestly not expecting their to be NPC'S in the first content update, however I hope that Bethesda does provide them in future, my worry is that they won't be able to due to technical limitations 
---
Time to farm ur new TSE, how long been friends with him
---
Good one =D
---
Could you maybe tell me the secret discoball-plan location ?
---
I have several recipes under misc that I can't use, does that mean I'm not a high enough level to use them or is it for future dlc?
---
I think the issue is that we don’t receive any notifications while we’re in workshop mode. Also a problem when you get a ‘defend your workshop’ message and you only find out when three scorchbeasts start spamming you.
---
Depends on what you want.
---
For melee, I went Max incisor, martial artist, and blocker, then had enough for one in each damage card, normal, expert, and master.
---
T60 is cheapest of anything only requires steel,adhesive, and aluminum. Everything else has gears/screws/springs or something else. Idt there is a list but you can see in the individual articles for each for example [https://fallout.gamepedia.com/T-60\_power\_armor\_(Fallout\_76)](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/T-60_power_armor_(Fallout_76))
---
Where is the glowing resin on the map?  There's a fever blossom in the town with the Mothman museum that isn't shown also.
---
If it was patched great, of it wasn't trade with caution.
---
How would the new year affect the hand scanners?
---
For sure? Not for sledgehammer?
---
That seems to be most people's experience that I've talked to.  I have the worst luck with people it seems haha. I'm NA but I have encountered people on mic that weren't speaking English or Spanish so I wasn't sure how that all worked. 
---
It looks like it said "Limited Time" "1 Day". No mention of Only 1 day so maybe there is a sliver of hope for me. 
---
Don't have the technology for that yet.
---
Good ole grahm the most amazing merchant off all
---
Nice, good luck with that😁👍🏻
---
1 month at least. Sad fucking person
---
Think mine is buggered, have explosive harpoon that does 340+ damage (apparently), doesnt even one shot ghouls.. .
---
I love my little harpoon gun &lt;3
---
Some people just like to watch the world burn . Now you have to decide if you want to be Batman or an innocent civilian 
---
I hope that known recipes will be grayed out in the future.  When trading with NPCs, players, or looking at a bag of items on the ground, ones you already know should be grayed out.  You should still be able to buy / get / pick them up, but it will let them know your character already learned them.
---
Most of us leveled up in the time when killing enemies higher levels than us gave us much more XP than it does now since they lowered that scale. Therefore, for the newer players, their playtime is already extended because of this. As a higher level, our advantage is experience, grinding, and utilizing blast zone flora.
---
It would have been cool for them to see it cap it and increase it with DLCs but we’re way past that now lol
---
No, up between Flatwoods and the bridge in a random spot in the woods. I haven't made it to Whitespring yet.
---
I would enjoy seeing other people’s power armor in their camps. 
---
I would argue that the servers are in need of repairs first.
---
this is funny because I am playing Fallout New Vegas and it does target allies in Vats sometimes :D :D :D
---
#patches #qualitycontrol
---
this is pretty interesting. it's one thing that nukes are down, but a visual change, accompanied with reduced/removed spawns? sounds kind of fishy.
---
have you already completed the main storyline and killed the queen? 
---
I have definitively gotten a 2 star gun from a 1 star legendary.
---
Never a 3 though.
---
A larger problem with the warning is that it doesn’t pop until someone initiates the claim. It often takes me longer to load there after getting the notification than it does for them to claim the workshop. Even with a warning, the workshop gets claimed out from under me.
---
Perhaps they should send a notification when something is lockpicked/broken instead of just when the claim is started. Or make the claim take longer/be easier to contest long enough to actually get there. 
---
I'm excited to see what DLC is going to bring us.
---
Maybe should of done a thread on DLC theories, besides vaults.
---
We all have all of the C.A.M.P. decorations but it’s still fun to see what people do with them.
---
This can get you banned from PSN/xbox live/anything future from Bethesda. DON"T FORCE A CHARGE BACK EVER

Nice! I really like the aesthetics of the area. Great job building around the bridge supports, I think I'll have to try something similar for my next C.A.M.P location. Thanks for sharing!
---
My name? Definitely not similar to cupcake in any way. 
---
Hmm, explosive expert + heavy weapons damage cards makes mine 900ish and it's just an explosive one...one shots mirelurk queens.
---
“Wouldn’t it be nice” plays over the radio in game. 
---
Oh boy.  How am I an idiot?  If a company refuses to honor a refund request for a returned item in which you have been promised a refund, your credit card company will usually honor that on your behalf.
---
Damnn i wouldnt trust anyone ive known for a month tbh. What platform is he and u remember his username?
---
Hey I think the rooftop gardens of Lewisburg have a lot of Ash Rose. 
---
Might be worth a look, cause if so it’ll make smoked mirelurk filets a lot easier to make.
---
Grsat point. Yet they already released all fallout 4 weapons though? Think they only added a few new one's to Fo76. So it'd be kinda hard to do.
---
Marathoner does not work in PA just fyi
---
People were never "duper hunting" those stores are just for entertainment.
---
I get that. I work in aviation though and would want it regardless of its rarity. I've done several reports on the SR-71 and the A-12. So it would be nice to have something with a little sentimental value. I wear the excavator armor now and can't say how many people I see with it. It doesn't matter to me the rarity but I understand why it does to others. 
---
I think they're bugged, at least for some people anyway.  There are a number of posts talking about it.  The only time I ever saw one was when I was on the quest where you get the radshield recipe reward.  There's a video on youtube that shows exactly where one is.  When I can log in the first thing I'm doing is to see if I can pick it or not.  Also, supposedly you can get them when doing the Heart of the Forest (or what ever it's called) event.  
---
This is awesome, thank you. 
---
Do you think Makeshift Warrior 5 + Luck of the Draw 3 would be enough to keep it healthy?
---
Does Luck of the Draw even work on overrepair?
---
Is it my phone or what? I can't see colors. Only black and white
---
Oh missed that lol one sec
---
To put it bluntly. The cosmetics in FO76  are rather mediocre, which surprises me, cause Bethesdas parent company Zenimax Online has great costume designers for ESO apparently. So Bethesda should have connections to people, which could step up their cosmetics.
---
However, I do not wonna encourage Bethesda right now to improve their Cashshop offerings. I want a much better performance on console foremost. The coolest attire would be meaningless to me, when the game still stutters and disconects.
---
They are most likely going to be Camp based machines like the vending machines outside of train stations. 
---
Hopefully if you place one it adds a marker on the map so others can find it much easier.
---
I did it twice last night since I just got to be General. Then I was fast traveling all over trying to find a scorched officer and not one. Last Friday, I ran into 5 of them in a 2 hour period. 
---
This entire exercise is an abject demonstration of how badly things are in Bethesda studios. If I understand it correctly bugs that are known and fixed by the community remain untouched by the actual studio and make it into ports of the game released after the fact.
---
Why is cranberry relish not on the xp food list? it gives 10% the trick is just getting a gourd or 2 in your own farm. The cranberries can be found around a lot of farms. Its a lot easier to make compared to the squirrel stew.
---
Nice someone is trying to get value out of cooking. I have tried this as well and its really finding a balance between camp placement and knowing ingredient locations. All in all its barely worth going really into depth with this. Als for AP you can use the blackberry drink for ap regen its easy to make. Also quite a few items that do not need cooking will give ap regen while walking/running overencumbewred. Honey, sugar bombs, sugar. In combat I prefer cola nut 1-2 for this because added hp regen rate when consuming.
---
It it a bug? I will probably keep it for when not in power armour 
---
on PS4, and yes I do but he has his settings on private so there is nothing much I can do unfortunately. Ah well.
---
You cannot wear them all.! Choose one to wear usualy the strongest one obviously and showcase the rest to rub in other peoples faces haha
---
You spend your hard earned atoms on PA paint jobs and you want everyone to see them but ypu can only wear one PA and equip one paint job..  this way you can have multiple PA with all having differnet paintjobs 😁👍
---
Now you'll have to dupe the weapons yourself :( poor dude.
---
It’s a zealot, limb damage, +1perception gun. The least 3 star, almost like a non-star.
---
Thats awesome
---
So would i... and many other people out there too
---
It's definitely not necessary as there are other ways to communicate but it is very helpful to have a mic. 
---
Makeshift Warrior.
---
Nope, I play alone and have never talked to anyone in game, and you'll rarely see other people anyway unless you're doing some popular events and such
---
Here's the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/abis05/have_they_broken_nukes_y2k/ed1m0i3/
---
That's one of the few small hopes I have from this whole experience. That subjecting themselves to a live service will humble them a bit more.
---
I think Bloodied Explosive is exactly as rare as Instigating Explosive, or TSE, or any other _____ Explosive mod combo.
---
Most of TSE weapons traded around the bazaar forums are duped. If you're trying to actually get your own explosive weapon in game, you're gonna just have to take what you can get.
---
If you're trying to buy one? You can have a TSE in 15 minutes.
---
It depends on how fast you can kill stuff. Is it taking one shot, two shots, three shots? If at some point you can one shot everything, then having an extra few % isn't going to be helping you much at all. Then you could swap some cards around and get more defense, or more utility etc. It's all situational depending on what you're doing, what you're fighting, etc. If you're farming getting one shot kills makes the process much easier. So if it's taking two shots and the health is low after the first shot, maybe a little more damage will get you there. If you're dying a lot maybe more defense would be useful.
---
&gt; Then quickly server hop. Like why?
---
It's easier to rack up a high bounty destroying someone's base (which takes very little to repair) comparatively to trying to kill randoms
---
I've come across several players who like doing this to create incentive for other players to attack them. There was a group I found last week that RP'd as outlaws lol
---
How much does it weigh though? Not sure if I gave room in my stash. 
---
Nah, you be good. It's helpful in a trade situation, but there are emotes and other actions to get you by (ie shooting at something you want someone to look at).
---
Same with me being at work irl but when I do play I just try to find new weapons and material farms.
---
Perfect
---
Well, try reporting it or something. 
---
Guess u can also charge it to experience
---
There are some statistics if you look under Map &gt; Z &gt; Challenges, but they seem kinda bugged (says i only killed 3 animals so far lol), also big YES for a dog follower, maybe a dog you can customize yourself, or let us just adopt that lonely pooch east of Harpers Ferry.
---
I felt like I was late to every party with each new server, I kept going to white springs and finding meatpiles with glowing meat in them. 
---
A few wikis said it previously but have now changed it
---
No, it's not necessary. But it helps. 
---
Idk if it is intended, but while in PA it has been proven to have no benefit. Also don't understand why you have crits/vats stuff. If you're going to be using heavy weapons you won't be using vats hardly ever
---
Lol melee OP so i have to spec fully into melee and stay low hp to hit like truck but have no spec into shotguns or explosives and i can pull out my TSE shotgun and mow down hordes in 1 shot..........yeah melees real OP lol play the game man youll find there is way OP things than melee. :)
---
I'm sure they could add a bunch of pre-recorded DJ tapes by someone who died years ago but had enough forsight to record them self and add their tapes to some sort of automated library.
---
You know like Abbie in the free states questline.
---
Recipes are only in "notes" and the action button says "learn", not "read". If learn is greyed out, it is already learned.
---
Camden can have excavater mods? I didn't know that. The only excavator mod I've seen was a calibrated shock from harpers ferry. 
---
Give people with duped items a permanent bounty that doesn't go away until they get rid of the item :p
---
Alright. You get my upvote. Take the change you filthy animal
---
Wait until he claimed it, then claim it back. The moment you start claiming an owned workshop, you can do full damage to the owner.
---
I love this response and agree with you.  The one OP weapon I have is a TSE Handmade.  I'm totally fine with them deleting it (not certain it's a dupe, but still). I like the thrill of the hunt and the game has gotten too easy with it.  I only ever use it on the Queen now.  
---
Bethesda can ban you for following proper procedures for getting your money back? That seems shady. 
---
So basically you are asking to make melee useless. 
---
I’ve seen a TSE auto grenade launcher
---
It’s probably dependent on your level 
---
This.
---
Easiest way to be sure (as some mods also have nondescriptive names like "Bladed'") is to look at what it scraps to. Black Titanium? Excavator.
---
If you get a good instigating+ power attack. And then have the bracers that reduce power attacking cost. You can ditch a few. 
---
Even just having a good instigating weapon you could sub out one. 
---
You grind and look for springs.
---
I usually drop something insignificant 1st, then open the Bags inventory to add the good stuff, because there is a known issue with the bag sometimes dropping through the mesh.
---
That said, I never intended to drop the Weapon that disappeared 
---
Didnt come across the fever blossom ill have to take another look i only mapped out points that i came across and i tried to cover everything but the resin is the squares on the map theres 3 to the east of mothman
---
There is almost always one Firecap in the Cemetery in the Forest.  On a fallen log in the weeds behind a tombstone. Sometimes there is another all the way in the back to the right of the shed.
---
You don't have to worry about the bugged one anymore. It now reads as "Advanced power connectors", before it was just the "Cheaper" barn set. I think I saw them mostly at Harper's ferry. 
---
Wait whaat?!? 
---
I've been server hopping super duper mart for a week and now i play with the sound off rather than listen to that slogan every time.
---
There is an under armor that is a flannel shirt, jeans and combat boots. I think that's what he was referring to. 
---
I’m on PCNA but it looks like someone here is gonna help you out!
---
You can, I have a bloodied explosive double barrel. 
---
Nah people barely talk in game.
---
A mixtures of emotes and mic with area enabled. I'm lazy and don't want to bind push to talk but never wear my headset with mic. I play with my stereo setup so I never really like wearing headphones/mic. 
---
you're an idiot because this is against the terms of service you agree to in PSN/xbox live/PC whatever. You can be banned for this. You're basically going behind Bethesda's back to force a return without the proper procedure. Even if the procedure is flawed they still want it followed.
---
Bravo.
---
had three crashes last night whilst trying to access my camp stash box. First time it's happened to me. I'm on XB1S  
---
Not shady at all it's literally spelled out that you are not allowed to force a charge back in your user agreement, you will be banned for doing so.
---
Maybe they just wanted to see your weapons and armor? That's what I would think.
---
I'm not that desperate yet but it's good to know why that challenge hadn't unlocked yet.
---
Best DPS is still the unyielding bloodied melee. Nobody beats their time in a queen fight if the get the queen to land early.
---
It at least feels somewhat balanced, only goes up to ~2230 damage with maxed out perks. Stacking adrenaline is not really a possibility with its slow reload, and it's still somewhat lacking in the DPS department.
---
No, they shouldn't fix this.
---
Some areas of the map are high level. Have you googled at all to see where the low-level areas are? If you come out of the vault and run in the wrong direction, yes you will die.  
---
If you want a reference for classic maps that ripped you a new asshole if you wandered into high level areas, look into all the gothics and the recent Elex.  
---
Or, load up Fallout 4, and notice that as you go South, the map gets harder and harder, and then also notice that the most famous farming area in all of Fallout 4 is an irradiated area in the lower left of the map that will indeed rip you a new asshole if you run there as a newb.
---
The second floor of top of the World would make a cool player hub, with the enemies cleared out of course. 
---
Same I did. Helmet too, I managed to find like 5 calibrated shocks for both excavator and t60, not a single shocks or targeting module for X01.
---
So hybryd X-01 and T60 it is.
---
I keep being asked to trade stuff too and I don't know why, my weapons and armour are shite. I drop stimpacks, disease cures and food &amp; drink for newbies and sometimes they take it and then ask to trade. I don't want their pipe pistols for goodness sake. Like you I freak out that they are trying to take one of my weapons. 
---
179 &gt;_&gt;
---
it's not going to happen. The only way they can fix this is increasing the weapon level to make duped items obsolete and only then should they do this after they patch the current methods of duping.
---
How how often do you get glowing postules
---
Do you have to keep the perkcard equipped to keep him at your camp?
---
Ah i dont know why i didnt think of that. Thank you 
---
Did you know that I have become is better engrish.
---
I couldn’t even figure out how to turn pacifist mode on. I looked thru all the menus in and outta game.  Guess time to look again
---
I tried to keep it close to what you had but made some large changes to the Luck field. The biggest change is to not rely on VATS as much as heavy gun eats through AP very quickly so you drop out of VATS. Also removed your crafting perks as they don't help in normal combat and can easily be switched out. [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d354a5c&amp;d=s00sq1s22s31sr1p00es2eg1c70ic4ip2a40a01l22ls2l71pe1cm0ce0id1a80a30lt2lu0sx1s80&amp;w=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=d354a5c&amp;d=s00sq1s22s31sr1p00es2eg1c70ic4ip2a40a01l22ls2l71pe1cm0ce0id1a80a30lt2lu0sx1s80&amp;w=&amp;n=)
---
Thanks for the reply,  yeah I'm okay.  My heavy weapons guy is only level 16 ATM anyway. 
---
On this note: powering up the plants is super worth it. You then don't need to make generators, which saves a ton on workshop gears and aluminum (depending on whether you prefer the large Generator or windmill) and lets you use them for crafting workbenches and turrets without going into your personal supply.
---
Probably Ash heap or any supermutant town. There are a lot of scorched in the dried lake encampment, Northeast of charleston. 
---
Also happened to me. Some guy came to my bass and destroyed my turrets. When I repaired them, they were hostile to me. But something was even more wrong: It took me so long to figure it out because their aim was abysmal. When I did, I destroyed them and repaired. But alas, nothing. So I joined a new server and guess who doesn’t care? My turrets! Storing and placing them down again worked for me
---
Level 17 is too early for top of the world. Explore the forest, than go to ash heap. Only after these areas are explored you should go to top of the world. This should be around level 30 to 35. 
---
FWIW I removed most of the junk cars from that red rocket after claiming it, and after removing one of the last ones I got an instant disconnect from server.
---
In the long term, I think workshops make sense as temporary claims in your current world - but the stability isn’t there yet.
---
Would like to see them give claimed workshops the camp treatment (re-place it, can go to another world and place if it’s claimed) for something like 4 hours of in-game time.  After that, you have to hold it without leaving, but this ensures a claim pays back even if you want to do the first defend wave and log off. Come back tomorrow and you have 3+ hours left.
---
Also would be great to auto-blueprint your latest design for a given workshop.  Or respawn your last design but it’s all broken so you have to pay to repair it all, but in any event a way to preserve your layout.
---
Finally, would be fun to have an active defense mode.  A thing you can build in a workshop that calls waves of enemies to defend, with limits on how often you can invoke it?
---
It's also because of how the map works, duh. In Fallout 4, the map gets harder as you go south, and if you take a new character into the glowing sea you will die. Duh.  
---
In 76, try going into the forest, or North-center to the waterpark, or only slightly south. Those are the easy areas of the map.
---
Thanks I will have a look
---
I'm not sure since I just disease cure whenever I get a disease
---
What are the mods for Ripper? I know of Curved and Extended.
---
It’s a pretty shitty feeling :(
---
Ok I guess it's not like fallout 4 were you could have max ap and go crazy with a mini gun
---
Yeah right ,obsidian would never team up with Bethesda after they destroyed the good name of fallout 
---
Grafton gives drug plans from events
---
Haha okay, it's very strange, like, how does this even happen, turrets are untrustworthy creatures obviously.
---
OOC, What is the affix on the weapon weight reduction armor?
---
I’m pretty sure the trade scam was debunked as a joke. 
---
Right? I would pay 3k right now for a legit X0-1 Jetpack.. I just don't want some copy pasted mod :(
---
If you play on xbox I can craft some free for you if you give me the plastic needed.
---
If you are just unlocking them get one point in each card first. This is because a lvl 1 card is 10 % dmg boost but leveling up card adda 5. So until you have all cards equipped leveling them.up is a wasted point.
---
yer, mine is explosive so it does some nice damage, I just really want to get a suppressor for it!
---
OP has gone through the proper procedure, though.  They promised him a refund and never delivered.  His first resort should be to continue to pester them, of course.  But ultimately - if all else fails, as I said in my original post - he can get his money back.
---
I suppose you could roll over and accept that you're never getting a refund despite being told you would.  Or you could fight it.  
---
Don't take corporate bullshit lying down.  Stand up for yourself.
---
Hey, Im looking for this, I can bring the mats and compensate you (name your price) if you install calibrated shocks on my T51 legs. 
---
Nope without the time freeze you'll just run outta AP / get swarmed 
---
Think I know just where that is, very atmospheric around there, like it a lot.
---
Yeah, I was doing the RadShield quest when I unknowingly picked them.  I had like 8 of them, and had Green Thumb equipped, so I must've picked at least 4 plants.
---
It's entirely possible they're bugged in some odd way.
---
I need to get my bos officer uniform shielded. Somebody was trying to charge me 1K and use my mats to apply the shielded to it. 
---
I found out the plasma core is for the gatling plasma.
---
LOL no idea. find a team launching a nuke from a specific silo and then go to the tube. Was curious on this myself.  
---
Would make a neat video if so.
---
It's not helped by how unintuitive the trading system is and the way people can see your entire inventory, I find it overwhelming and the lack of choice of emoticons makes it hard to understand other players when neither of you has a mic. 
---
The mutation that made you have electrical damage when attacked has an effect.
---
But yes there should be more 
---
I wanna see that giant excavator from the Ash Heap roll across the wasteland and also aliens trying to kill us with black powder rifles (because energy weapons suck in this game, sorry energy gun users)
---
when open mics were a thing most people just got used to communicating with the emotes or not at all.
---
Have you damn updoot
---
Missed the Marathoner thing I'd change it to Adrenaline 3 then, you kill stuff quickly so it helps.
---
You can only equip one or the other.
---
Max intelligence and idk if it’s a mechanic  or what but even without the perk to reduce power core drain...I’ve been using the same one power core for the past 50 levels. My builds are weird but they work in mysterious ways. This build is 15STR 2per 3End 3chr 15int 3agi 15 luk. 
---
My other build is real weird and is more a QOL survivor relax build at 3str 3per 15 end 15chr 3int 15agi 2luk 
---
You can't equip the same card twice. But all unique cards stack.
---
Main menu in options I believe. Definitely to prevent switching to pacifist in game after not behaving that way.
---
This is america we speak english *ToNs🤠🤠
---
Swarmed? Isn't that good if the enemies stand right in front of the mini gun lol
---
Yeah, I do AWOL Armaments when I see it pop up but not had much luck with radium rifles as rewards. I've got a few mods now but i'd really like the hardened receiver, reflex sights and suppressor. I've scrapped around 30 or so now and learned maybe 4 mods. Life is tough on the Radium Train Brother. 
---
You can't, if you add the spare the higher card is removed...
---
Didn'tthe artillery dupe glitch get patched? I haven't seen another way to dupe personally. But then again i still see people with 5k weight and tse weapons.
---
I got my skate blade from either vendor, quest, or scrapping them.
---
The Pleasant Valley Ski Resort vendor (up the hill inside the building, not the train station) has 2-4 ski swords in the room he's in.  Grab em all and scrap them while you're waiting on getting the plans.
---
I noticed that happens to fissures that get nuked though (they get filled in). So it sounds like those fissures are just in the "nuked" state.
---
Oh crap, that boss battle would be just terrifying.  The land would be utterly destroyed. 
---
he bought the PC version he can do a charge back
---
Obviously they saw how good it was and forced them to release it ASAP before they could be completely outshone.
---
Yes they are still available after completing organic solution just keep your eyes peeled, they were pretty tricky for me to spot but once you see them they are unmistakable.
---
Amen to that. I have missile turrets at my base which simultaneously make me feel more and less secure. If those suckers turn on me then it’s all over
---
I know they sell the gun plans regularly but the mod plans seem much rarer. I'd just like to find a supply of ready made ones to scrap. 
---
do a charge back and keep that email as confirmation you were to receive a refund. You are on PC and you should be fine.
---
Seriously? Well shit man, why all the controversy around it on this forum? If that’s true then yeah..I feel like a dick
---
If you know how to roll with the punches so to speak, you can REALLY have fun with the glitch.
---
Case in point:
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/tempest-storm27/video/65829258
---
Fully functional and huge AF
---
What we need is more end game content that is DIFFICULT. Nothing in the game is hard end game at this point. Scale enemies levels higher (up to 100) and nerf all TSE explosive weapons. Give us a raid!
---
If you're heart broken about 20-60 dollars then yea go through your CC company and risk being banned from your console or any future Bethesda release. Or go through Bethesda support and wait a little longer seems like an easy choice to me. 
---
&gt;before they could be completely outshone
---
Too late.
---
What's the first rule of Fallout Fight Club?
---
I've sold off a 3 star mr. handy saw to a vendor. Found it either at whitesprings or queen, but it was a joke of a weapon, so no reason to keep it. :x 
---
Credit Card charge backs are not supposed to be used to settle disputes like this. OP will likely loose his/her credit card if they follow your advice.
---
Or even like, a 5 minute timer after looting their bag. It's frustrating
---
Yes, that would be devastating. 
---
&gt; they'd
---
That's future-tense. They've said they would in a future patch.
---
If I'm right, in the situation you mention, no.
---
If there was a separate perk like "enhanced packrat" or something then that would stack. For example Having Rifleman regardless of it's rank with Expert Rifleman regardless of Expert's rank.
---
I'm almost positive that more rank one cards of pack rat wont stack with other pack rat cards. That would be kind of pointless with the rank up system.
---
Where I may I also see this spetical?!,
---
make sure you check the cash registers at vendors and overseer's cache boxes. Me and quite a few other people dump legendaries we dont need and plans and excess ammo in these. 
---
Hey, I can deal with the went sleeping bag, can it just not be night for ten freaking years, please?! 
---
Also, (if you aren't aware of this yet) don't forget to set up a search for ballistic fiber - have ballistic fiber or something containing  it in your inventory, go into pip-boy, look at junk and view junk by component (RB on Xbox).  Find ballistc fiber and press the action button (a on Xbox).  This will show a magnifying glass icon at the end of the item name for anything you have in the search, which makes it easier to find.
---
Not always.  Even in the same play session I’ve had it go both ways.  Got warned that mount Blaire was being claimed and I defended it, then a couple hours later on I saw that someone else had claimed my workshop at Beckley Mine and I hadn’t ever gotten a notification about it.
---
Ha!
---
Whats the first rule of what??
---
You don’t use vats ?
---
There's another one somewhere that has a huge pile of razorgrain among other things.  I've got planted at my camp eight corn, four razorgrain, four tato, four mutfruit, four gourds, four melons, and finally two carrots lol.  Part of that is for when I need vegetable starch for adhesive, the rest of the time it's to make food when I run out of canned dog food.
---
To be fair i also called it a gladiator fight 
---
I'd rather just head to Charleston FD and clean house.
---
If "heart of the swamp" shows on the map you can collect strangler bloom and I can swear ive picked up those swamp plants there as well. Someone also told me that you can start the purifier (from the rad shield quest in the chem factory) at any time after you have done the quest. This requires a rare deathclaw part though. But it will make the strangler blooms pop up and also swamp plant I would guess if they are related. 
---
Not if you're in VATS, your dps is incredibly low in vats, outside of vats you're fine obviously 
---
Just hacking, whacking, and choppin' that meat!
---
They did this with ESO with the champion point system. Don't see why they couldn't do the same with FO76
---
That’s amazing! Must be great to have similar interest such as this. Do u guys play fallout together?
---
It's not really a bug, they just designed energy weapon durability poorly.
---
reported for animal abuse. 
---
I’ve been playing since launch and I haven’t been attacked once.  So far everyone is helpful or, worst case, apathetic towards other players.
---
Who's got two thumbs and made a point of stockpiling atoms in anticipation of the Blackbird paint set?
---
This guy!
---
I think mining ore might be the best way to go now for ammo unless it needs exotic stuff.  5.56 though, just mine the steel/lead and use bulk acid trick.  You'll need some plastic to multiply your acid, but other than that, the ore is really easy to obtain.
---
Nuclear Waste is too precious to waste making lead.
---
This bug frustrates me so much. I saw one the other day where someone had set up a concrete castle filled with about 50+ large water purifiers. 
---
I've had people in-game brag to me about how to abuse this glitch, and I'm starting to see it everywhere. I hope it gets fixed soon. 
---
there is quite a few places like this in the mire one i'd recommend is south east of the red rocket near harpers
---
Right thanks for the advise. I will take another look in to the build and put another link on this post when I have made the changes 
---
If I had a mutation, I’d name it Marla 
---
You can remove mutations with Rad Away. It might take a few but it’ll cure the mutation eventually 
---
Everything isn't fine. Bethesda knows they fucked up and I trust they'll fix it. The kind of have to.
---
For whatever reason its doing damage comparable to a "Maxed out" Hunting Rifle, despite saying its damage value being twice a HRs.
---
To explain my personal experience that needs to be addressed. This is on my Rifleman Main, the opposite of my Melee Main.
---
So maxed out Rifleman Perks, Tank Killer, BloodyMess. Hunting Rifle was found with a REFINED .50 reciever. Meaning its damage value is about 1-2 less than a Hardened, but ammo is no longer an issue with 180/360 .50 created per pop at a tinkerer.
---
On the other hand, I have a Gauss Rifle, with a damage value practically twice the Hunting Rifle due to perks above, of course. Both guns are doing the same amount of damage, sans maybe a sliver of difference, which i think the HR is coming out on top. Neither gun is Legendary, what the frig.
---
munitions factory has a lead deposit👍 and what bulk acid trick? is that a feature or and oversight/bug
---
I'll comment on some of the perks that I think are less useful as someone who runs heavy weapons:    
---
\- Bandolier: You probably don't need this as even with a few thousand ammo it doesn't necessarily weigh -that- much
---
\- Bear arms is good if you're carrying multiple heavy weapons but if you only have a gatling gun or something I'd take something else like pack rat/traveling pharmacy
---
\- Concentrated fire: I find heavy weapons eat AP like crazy and give little for it. Not to mention the VATs criticals are negligible.
---
\- Chem fiend/chem resistant: Since you can only use one chem at a time and they seem to rarely trigger addictions I wouldn't bother with any of these
---
\- In intelligence I wouldn't use anything except gunsmith/stabilized, I don't find power armor needs to be repaired that often
---
\- Marathoner won't be worth it and you won't need ammo smith during combat
---
\- Luck of the draw, psychopat, lucky break (procs rarely for little repair), four leaf clover, critical saavy, better criticals, all those I think are just not very good for heavy weapons which aren't VATs efficient and don't benefit from crit speccing
---
Here's a heavy weapon's build I use:

---
Lmfao imagine strolling up to a railroad station to hear someone singing to themselves
---
Cranberry relish is listed twice.  I got the recipe after I had written all of this up and listed it at the very bottom as an "oddball" recipe that gives bonuses to two of the benefits that I describe, XP bonus as well as an AP burst.  I think it's oddball because who needs an AP burst at the same time they're eating the food for the XP boost?  Seems weird.  Anyway, when I summarized at the very bottom with my list of "best" imo I included it as an XP bonus option.
---
I kind of like the massive hoards of bots at Whitesprings lol
---
Ackshually it’s army fatigues and dirty army fatigues. They look identical ones Underarmor ones costume.
---
There could be the same thing for the khaki uni I don’t really know. 
---
There is lol just have to have a mic
---
Ah, another Vault Dweller with taste. .
---
I too am rocking the red tactical lamps. Hella awesome!
---
Alot. I run Mele as well and my power attack does more than double a normal attack.
---
Those places are always clean lately I jump 5 servers and get lucky to find 1 missed 5lb weight sometimes. lol I hit Charleston, green country lodge and all 3 missile sites and more often than not they've been cleaned this is simply an alternative method to acquire lead
---
Here is my old build, I switched to melee XP

---
I was confused at first but I think the OP would like a way to remove a particular mutation with a serum, in case you get one you really don't want?
---
If you go to any river/pond you can literally gather 300 dirty water in under 10 seconds
---
a new patch
---
Wrenches and tin cans are my ammunition life blood, I burn through 10mm really fast for my pistol build lol.  My .44 pistol does more damage than my .50 hunting rifle.
---
It really wouldn't. Every "fix" results in more bugs introduced, especially if their idea to fix is to slap in a limiter that prevents a certain number of items created, but the apparent thing that allows duping to work is a final count before the server disconnects you.   
---
The algorithm that allows duping to happen takes advantage of Bethesda's lack of signalling checks between the client-side application and the server, which results in queuing. It's not easy to fix, but not impossible. I had a similar assignment when I worked in medical imaging that would result in similar scenarios to occur. 
---
I keep falling off the chained logs.  I guess I could try this w/o my PA, but if the reward isn't worth it, meh.
---
Yea, I know, but I just really hate empathy and have been trying to roll it out of my mutations forever only to lose good ones and have to spend more time irradiating myself and fumbling around perk cards
---
What I do not want to see is in-camp vending machines for 2 reasons:
---
1. You'll have to show player base locations on the map, which will make it super easy for griefers to come smash your vending machines constantly.  Don't like a price a person is offering?  Smash the machine and have your buddy take your bounty.
---
2. I do not want to travel all over the place, only to find player camp vendors loaded up with pipe pistols, .38 ammo, and rotten food.  After a while I'm not even going to bother checking, because I don't want trash....lol
---
They need a central location (or several locations) for the vending machines.  Whitesprings is a natural choice because it's center of the map, lots of players go there, and it would be easy to drop nuke zone loot in your own vending machines.  If you need to visit it during a nuke zone, just slap on your hazmat suit and fast travel to the train station vendor, the only enemies between there and the closest entrance to the basement vendors.........are random spawns that come in to fight the bots at that gate.
---
I'm also hoping that if it is ONE terminal accesses ALL player sold items (to include multiples of that terminal), that there are some robust search features.  So I can quickly check if they have a new Gragnak Axe or Handmade rifle, without scrolling past 100 lines of junk looking for  it.
---
If it happens that there are MULTIPLE terminals that access ONE player's sold items, that they make some feature like a red or green light up on top of it to say "hey this terminal has something to sell".  If there's 24 terminals for 24 players, and 80% of them are empty, checking them will get annoying.
---
There's an issue (I've experienced) when trading items and then canceling while buying them, stuff disappears from the potential sellers inventory until re log. The stuff is usually what was up to be traded, but I've had random items disappear till re log as well. Nobody was ever able to provide proof that the trade glitch was a thing so some people think it was just people over reacting before relogging. 
---
Same thing with the PA steal glitch, I haven't been able to reproduce it and have found no video evidence of it. 
---
Its not just the compass. If you look closely the headlamp light in first person is also off center. Its like your whole character is facing a slightly different direction than the camera and that's why everything is fucky. 
---
I'm always dropping it when I hit about 250 to make space ... this is better than dropping
---
And get this. My dumb ass is the PA Edition buyer.
---
Biggest camp in existence (AFAIK) weighing in at ten floors, 44 Brahmin and 17 turrets with the whole first verse to country roads in neon just to list a few highlights:
---
It’s a Slaughterhouse, community hall, junk museum, orchestra, and even big enough to be a scorchbeast landing pad:
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/tempest-storm27/video/66156228
---
oh shit I forgot to mention that
---
this was when I learned that vats is really useful in pvp. After I missed those first 3 shots and the one after I started using vats, which is why I hit all of the next shots
---
Damn and here i'm wondering why i never had the option to tame at the Whitesprings spot mentioned above, because creatures there are often alone and random too. Everything like it has to be.. or not. Guess i try my luck again at Cranberry Glades or the spot above the tree house.
---
I missed it, and it's awesome, but I disagree.  Let it be wxckusive for the people who nabbed it.  There will be more for us later.
---
I'd prefer they had a Beta exclusive paint tho.
---
I think OP would like a mean to remove a specific mutation, not one at random.
---
Hit a mob with a normal attack and take a screenshot of its health. Then do the same with a power attack. Then you can see how much it does in comparison.
---
I gotta say, my experiences have been completely different. This game sucks, this subreddit is filled with stories that try to give validation to a game that is EARLY ACCESS as far as, literally every single review is concerned, and the circle jerking of people talking about their "AWESOME EXPERIENCES" give me the indication that you NEED those posts to justify Bethesda and their shitty game.
---
That would be my assumption.
---
On xbox1 the system will sometimes get hung up in trying to get out of/into VATS mode. It's not consistent, but occasionally I'll target or kill an enemy in VATS and the game will "switch" back and forth between modes instantly and continuously. It's like the system is trying to get out of VATS but as soon as it does it is pulled back in and since the command to get out wasn't completed it tries again. This tug of war back and forth (many times a second) continues until another enemy is killed or targeted in VATS. I've noticed it doing this on and off since the last update.
---
This is an excellent idea.
---
On resources at CAMPS, that is correct.
---
However, any locked safes, boxes, etc that are part of a workshop still count friends as "stealing".
---
Stupid mole miners. I will get revenge on every last one of them.
---
Wow thank you so much perfect timing as I was just twerking my build and yes I was planning on having two or three heavy weapons on me. But I am not sure which ones. 
---
That’s all fine, but Whitesprings shouldn’t be a permanent Lvl 63 zone. It has far to many important story moments, and the player shouldn’t have to avoid it until they power grind.
---
Recently, I had a very confusing conversation with someone. After they left, I realized my mic was turned off. Curse you, First Person Perspective!
---
Yes, but it only affects when a starred quest is completed and you don't receive loot rewards unless you are the quest owner. Quests and events will not be considered group quests unless they are selected by the party leader.
---
I feel this post on a spiritual level. Unlike most people, all I did were quests at the start. So when I got unique quest weapons and armor, I was really upset that I couldn’t level them up. I was also upset I couldn’t rebuy them like you can in other games. I know some people have accidentally lost theirs and now it’s gone forever unless they want to make another character, get to level 50, and then do the quests again
---
I meam fair enough you're allowed to want that. I like the direction they took with it, and while i agree their may be technical limitations to implent human NPC's i honestly don't see how that would make the game much different. I mean it stands to reason most people are dead and most places are uninhabited. Not everywhere would be able to rise from the ashes, far from it in fact without ANY infrastructue. Remember, it's only been 20odd years since total annihilation, things are real fucking bad. 
---
I like to leave a PA frame outside of 76 without a fusion core. Lol. 
---
So we are all just mindless NPCs standing in fire, huh? /s  
---
I at least liked McCready with the Legendary minigun. 
---
But I too like to play solo. I don't have to worry someone else is going to take my screws or springs. Also, without an objective its all like "Well what do you want to do?". Player A is done with questing and B is halfway through. I like the challenge of clearing out a place, solo. 2 guys it goes too quick. 
---
In most cases, the popup usually comes and goes in the midst of a fire fight so I quickly forget about it. 
---
My brother uses this card, he appears often but he can't save you from an accidental explosive shotgun blast because 9 times out of 10 it's an instant death with no chance for revival.
---
"cabinets" from the free states vendor. 
---
The interest in PvP is almost nonexistent anyway - people just server hop away any time someone pings them. I am betting that the pacifist flag is set on the vast majority of accounts. There are a few out there wanting to play raider or bounty hunter, but most people want to just explore and kill critters. 
---
That won't work if he has pacifist mode on. But as soon as this person took the location you could challenge and that would turn pvp on.
---
 [u/Ultrime\_Deeth](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ultrime_Deeth) The plot deepens
---
XP?
---
No just need the perk to tame him in the first place, don’t need it again after unless you want to replace it, or to pacify him when someone is at your camp so he stops trying to eat them 
---
i never play on 3rd, didnt even know one showed up :d
---
I have completed the main quest, but I have yet to kill the Queen. I was planning to do it sometime this week, but I didn't know the nukes were down until people said something on this thread.
---
Once fixed, the terminal in the command center should provide an area to search for scorched officers.
---
I can see the goofy stuff for the camp.
---
His Credit Card company won't like it, and he can possibly lose his card.
---
The first time I went I thought that was Phoenix talking....
---
just a face :P
---
Most people that do that are on some corner of the map where it would cost them 50 caps to fast travel there. So they try to team up and travel for free. 
---
Menu&gt;Game&gt;Pacifist
---
I have an instigating super sledge. Should I be expecting 4x damage on the first hit then? Do you run out of AP, or is it just a slower attack?
---
Agreed. I've been griefed a few times and it's just lame. Adds nothing to the experience because the entire pvp architecture is shit.
---
I cant see anyone being interested in pvp because the core gameplay is a shitty fps with built in aimbot.
---
Not sure if its a feature/bug, but it takes 10 acid to create bulk acid, and you get 15 acid when you scrap it.  Just consumes plastic bulking acid.  Look at this guide for mining (not with a resource extractor, just use the Excavator to mine veins of ore)...
---

---
lol I figured that out one day while getting frustrated at how long it takes to collect water (I had always been using the pump before) so I just started mashing the collect button while looking at my phone for a bit. A mirelurk attacked a few minutes later, and I checked how much water I had collected after taking care of it. Had over 250 something and actually had to dump a bunch so i could fast travel away. The water pump is seriously a waste of camp space.
---
T51 power armour is best
---
Not only power attack’s, try a sprinting power attack.
---
lol no he won't, I have done it before with a late refund. He has confirmation he was due to have a refund, he has given them over a month to refund when it only takes 5-10 business days. He has everything he needs for his credit card company to back him up, he makes them money not Bethesda, they wont vouch for them.
---
Yup! I love it too. Freaks you out. Not all are harmless unless you shoot at it. There’s a fissure in the forest and if you get too close it attacks.
---
If you do get attacked, find cover or a building and stay still. Like many things in this game, sound attracts them. Scorched beast are bats after all.
---
There’s been many times my group at lower levels have attracted their attention, and we end up high talking to the nearest building where we all crouch down till it goes away.
---
Once we all found ourselves being silent. Then laughed at that afterwards. 
---
None of this will ever change and you all know it. Will be astounded if they make any great changes to this experiment of theirs. 
---
What is this? Just running into the enemy while winding up?
---
Things are supposed to be difficult and rare, that is how game mechanics work.
---
If everything was easy I wouldn't like the game as much.
---
I have a 30 minute or so routine that yields 196 +/- lead on each run :) 
---
Swamp Butter is where it's at.
---
Exactly all this.
---
I think the Vault-Tec Leather Armor paint also shows a Vault-Tec paint for the Hunting Rifle, which makes me hopeful there'll be more paints at some point - I'd love to get just a basic, clean black paint. (Of course, I'd also like if the Hunting Rifle was still viable, rather than being completely outclassed by the Lever Action Rifle...)
---
Basically play the rad roulette until you get a few you like and none you don't, then buy the serum for any more you want. I lose Marsupial one time by accident. It was bad. I haven't really grinded any since then. I have Speed Demon and don't want to lose it, but I guess I'll have to play the game because I can't be bothered farming caps to buy the serum. Maybe once I get a few and only need 1 I'll get a serum for that one.
---
Yeah it has long been confirmed to be fake. Though most people believe it to be a malicious rumor intentionally started to discredit the game rather than a joke.
---
&gt;by crapping them
---
I think I crapped one this morning. It even chipped the porcelain.
---
It feels like gunsmith doesn't affect laser weapons like it should, unless energy weapons magically fall under another perk category that I'm missing.  After getting gunsmith five it's nice to not break my combat shotgun and hunting rifle in like, 30 shots.
---
TBH the base breakage rate for most weapons is too high.  I feel like they need about another 15-20% base health.
---
I’m down, are we just doing melee and melee weapons or guns as well?
---
Saw some lastnight for around the 350 cap area with the second rank of the discount perk.
---
definitely a little icon for ~~camps~~ *griefer targets* with shops
---
Okay then...
---
Try 3 lvl 80s. I couldn’t even see through the dumbass green ring spam.
---
They are seriously the most annoying enemy in the game.
---
I think i can do like rounds, what lvl are you?
---
#1 - yep
---
As for the rest, I believe time will sort it out.  Players that raced through with cheats will get bored and leave.  It's already happened to a large degree.
---
It’s tough to see without numbers but my experience is sprinting and attacking does more damage than not, but yes be sprinting when hitting the attack button.
---
Still down? I saw a post saying they did a hot fix during the night :(
---
Rank 3 Power Patcher makes power armor repairs cost nothing. That being said I also crafted my XO1 with rank 3 Power Smith and have been going on 30 ish hours without having to repair them. 
---
Not if your in a repair/modify screen on a crafting bench
---
For some reason that one really freaks me out especially cuz I listened to it st night with turtle beaches on 
---
Did you know it isn't English in the first place? It from a 700 verse hindu manuscript written in sanskrit called the Bhagavad Gita, which itself if part of the epic Mahabharata? It was referenced by J. Robert Oppenheimer, who was considered one of the fathers of the atomic bomb. 
---
R/iamverysmart
---
not if your in a repair/modify screen on a crafting bench
---
You want Fallout76 to be a seasonal game? Yeah no thanks. This game is similar to WoW, getting leveling up is not much fun and the game really doesnt begin until 45 or 50. When you can actually see how strong you are. 
---
That would be hilarious I fully support this idea 
---
What platform? I’d be willing to apply the paint to your armor if I can. I’m on PC.
---
While playing with the explosive tesla shotgun, I come to find charging does not increase the damage. I wonder if the charge is related to the arc at all.
---
Too bad there is no way for them to  get rid of  dupes lol nice  try tho crybabies.
---
I'll take it if you still have it! 
---
With perks mine does 800 per shot...
---
OOOOH YEAHAAAHHH!!!!
---
At a vendor? Which one?
---
White knight.  Drop the points and you won’t need ballistic fiber ever again...well a long time anyway 
---
whitespring camping has gotten me about 4000 screws in a week just from killing the wendigo that spawns there. he always drops 7 screws.
---
So do i
---
I'll give this a try, thanks! (runs into a Whitesprings full of ghouls and promptly dies...)
---
But I like my Prototype paint!
---
Ah well. I can't lie - I don't even use the dang PA anyway.
---
&gt;How do you communicate with other players?
---
Poorly. I've only been able to talk to one other random person, a woman who admired my camp. No one else seems to have a mic and other than a friendly wave now, I have stopped trying to talk to people after asking, "Are you mic'ed? Hey, \[Player's Name\], are you mic'ed?" If they don't respond via mic I wave and move on.
---
It's still considered a two-handed weapon even if you swing it with one.
---
You can drop a water pump in it, and you can still get purified water.
---
Why was this removed lmao
---
Yeah probably, I’m sure there’s someone out there who just hoards the colas but biggest issue is where do they choose cutoff. I could totally see some people having 100-200 legit and just hoarding, 1000 probably duped though 
---
Thought 1: How can there be THIS MANY bugs in a game? I totally understand that in an open world game, especially one this big, bugs are easy to overlook, and sometimes piles of data just don't want to cooperate with each other. I get it. Often i even defend developers over it. Not everything can be foreseen. Not everything can be tested. But holy cripes, there are SO MANY bugs in this. And a lot of them seem to come down to simple typos and omissions in text. .8 instead of 8. Level restriction parameters just left out. Those things really baffle me, especially after they've been brought to dev's attention. I know it's not quite THIS simple, but for god's sake, can't they go delete a decimal and patch it in right away? Shouldn't take that long, right?   
---
Thought 2: I love playing the game. It's as fun as other Fallouts, just lighter on the questing. I get addicted to it. My idea of fun in the game, which seems to be different than most, is to get OP and just be able to go where i want and one shot monsters and never get close to dying. I want to be god of the wasteland. At that point i have a lot of fun. Only reason i haven't played in a few days is that i'm in the middle of quests where i'm not GotW yet, and i'm having trouble leveling up, so i've played some of my neglected games instead. But, yeah...  
---
Tl;Dr: OMG SO MANY BUGS, but it's still so much fun. 
---
Is 4 hits per second documented?  Or an estimate?  Thanks!
---
oh, sorry, here's you missing "S" :D
---
Nope still down
---
Good for you! Congratulations on not being a sheep. 
---
Make sure you're using WHITE KNIGHT and FIX IT GOOD perks.
---
White Knight (max stars) reduces the requirements to just ONE ballistic fiber per armor piece.
---
Fix it Good (max stars) gives your repaired armor 200% of normal durability AND increases the damage resist.
---
Weapon Artisan does the same 200% repair and increased damage.
---
Hope that helps!
---
That doesn't always work. From my experience even turrets don't count as the player so if they're doing all the work you can do literally nothing. 
---
No problem! I'll add more as more tips arise and things change so keep an eye on this thread.
---
It seems like maybe 1 out of 5 people are using mics, at least on console. I would recommend one  if you plan on teaming up for anything serious, or want to do any trading. I've been playing for about 170 hours and only plugged my mic in once, just to make sure it worked.
---
There's a bug. Check out the official fallout twitter.
---
I am fine with the Atomic Shop in general, but I would rather see the realistic lore-based costumes to be found in-game through normal play. I think the atomic shop is fine for purely cosmetic items like the funny/fancy/formal outfits, but I would hate to have to spend atoms to get an outfit like the Chinese Stealth Suit when it should be found in some cool Chinese sleeper cell base in the game. Hopefully those lore costumes get added with related DLC content.
---
BTW, you can get the Marine Wetsuit with Marine Tactical Helmet in the game now which is similar to the Chinese stealth suit.
---
Broken, been none since 31st 
---
I can't speak for anybody, but the legendaries I drop are ones that I simply cannot use, and all of my vendors caps are depleted.  If anybody low-level is nearby, I'll include some food or stims or something in addition to the legendaries.. but that's really it.
---
Most folks don't have the carry weight to hoard lower-level legendaries until we encounter somebody.  Things are just way too restrictive for that.
---
There is a plethora of squirrels on the north part of the map a little east of the water park. I was playing with someone who cooks a ton and he set up his camp there for the little guys. We seriously got like 10 each in 5 minutes they kept respawning frequently.
---
Lower rate of fire stuff seems to scale better with damage perks.  I really like the gatling so far.  Enough to farm up the plan and unlock some mods.
---
the breath attack is what needs some adjustment, flying enemies will always be a pain, unless you wanna vats it up
---
i was hesitant on buying it due to all the redditors bitching about this game, as well as gaming news sites. I just think people put way too much expectations on this game. 
---
Shit really? That kinda stuff has to be easy to track just follow the eBay accounts and ban, that’s gotta be against the terms and service 
---
Awesome nice build mate. I came across your video about 2 days ago while watching another CAMP video.
---
I do too, and when it gets slow something always surprises me....at lvl 93 and still cant find a decent bed plan. Lol
---
Reading through the comments on this one, makes me wonder about several things;
---
1. I generally receive better Legendary Loot when fighting alone, which frequently means enemies get time to mutate while dealing with Mobs, happens a lot around White Springs, after the Blast zone clears, I usually stick around a while to mop up straggler Legendary Ghouls.
---
2. Nearly every time I have done Uranium Fever alone, I end up with 4 legendary Items, even though there are only 3 Legendary enemies that spawn, the Boss Mole Miner drops a legendary as well, but it may be that the Legendary tag is getting dropped from his name because of the Boss tag.
---
3. I got some really good Legendary Items in Watoga area, from both Robots &amp; Ghouls, but in most cases, I was out of PA, and using my Stealth abilities to kill them slowly with non explosive, silenced weapons, it's neat to get successive sneak bonus damage for 4-5 shots in a row, and watch an Assaultron run around looking for you while you head shot it over &amp; over again.
---
Mine was like a total of six charred ghouls. For the whole event.
---
Unless their official twitter announces a fix, I would take shit you see on reddit with a grain of salt.
---
No. Still two handed.
---
They did?  When?  I was on a good chunk of the night, and didn't get the boot for any hotfix application.
---
There's a "bug" people are talking about when you PLACE power armor and start working on it at a station, people can steal armor off of it. Although no evidence has been provided. 
---

---
Ok here we go I am liking where this build is going. Please look and tell me if it is better or worse. 
---
Many thanks everyone
---
Is trading a big deal? Or can you have enough fun without?
---
Apparently was just an assumption. Hopefully will be fixed soon! 
---
I'm level 37 but you can add me, my in game is psychoapocalipse.  I've been looking to team up for a while with some people, I'll just handicap myself with pistols lol.
---
I apologize for wording that poorly, I updated it to make more sense (hopefully lol). Glad to hear this info could be of use to others!
---
Aah I see. Yeah the AP regen is a odd one there. All in all nice write up though.
---
I personally love the game even though it is rather boring end game at the minute. 
---
This is the one I use, thank you for linking it!
---
Do you have any extra portapotty plans?
---
I have 2 God tier, bloodied swing speed, one handed and two, looking for a twoshot gamma or unyielding +1str/luck
---
It depends on how many points you have available. One in each card is +30%, but it takes 9 points to only get that up to +60%.
---
There are also level locked areas where enemies are capped.
---
Ooooh face plan I can not believe I did not see that lol I thought it was a nickname for the type of meele build
---
I'd like to see recipes you know GRAYED OUT when you look at them.
---
You can still pick them up, buy them, trade them, etc.
---
That way at least you'd know you don't need it for your character.
---
That's absolutely awesome and adorable!
---
Bring back the karma system, give players stuff or trade or complete events? Good karma.
---
Kill players raid or take their items? Bad karma.
---
Yup, my first SB kill was with the help of that turret outside of watoga , after that you want more :D
---
Watoga, several sets there, they spawn random so server hop...
---
It does drain your ap. For my super sledge it drains about 30 AP per attack. When you have no AP, it won't let you power attack. The bar will flash red. It is possible to get to 4x damage on first hit ( especially with the sneak perk.) I use All Rise. You should look that sledge up.
---
You'll find it around at various locations and have to repair it. As far as I can tell you will have to find some pieces in different locations. I haven't found a plan for a power armor station at my bench yet though. 
---
Breathe toxic air in the ash heap.
---
ii've only encountered level 90+ with me being level 103 currently with a soldier build i can about 1 shot if using my exsposive shotty. and most definite 1 shot if i move my perk cards around and use my super sledge but i'm a have to encounter a low level trying to pick a fight with me to see what happens. my buddy said that my level 35 10mm machinegun should counter low levels easy. kept it on ever since.
---
Well.. 20 minutes for 5% means you have you play 400 minutes to even start gaining xp.. And its boring:p
---
I like taking workshops from people, I think fun. I like to acquire them then crotch for stealth  and wait for them to return to shoot them. I dont do it all the time.
---
WHAT DID I TELL YOU NOT TO DO, MATE?!
---
To get a lot of the best guns you'll have to do some trading. Unless your unreasonably lucky. :-P
---
Could I just get Country Roads on repeat?!
---
Drop your base down somewhere else. Everything will be repaired. Problem solved. 
---
The problem is I want Martial Artist, Blocker, and Incisor with the build. I can’t have all of them max if I want those as well. 
---
Good idea, but some of us cant deal with an unmatched set. :P
---
The going rate for calibrated shocks already applied to x-01 legs is about 1k, which is pretty affordable.
---
My bigger conundrum is that Excavator + shocks weight bonus is so good, I am considering just shelving x-01 altogether. Trying to figure out if I can live without a jetpack.
---
Like the green dust? I’m fine with that. I just can’t see through the burst of rings when 3 of them are going at once.
---
At least it doesn’t instantly crash my game when it hits me like it did at release.
---
Y2K hit the nuclear silos, bethesda is working on fixing it. should be a hotfix sometime today.
---
It drains some AP and is a lot slower.
---
Counterpoint: Why would the duper run a store? It's not like the economy is centralized like PoE or Runescape, and even then they can just dupe caps can't they?
---
If they wanted to just spread free gear, wouldn't they just find player housing and drop a paper bag full of stuff next to the stash?
---
They need to get this worked out asap. It's turning people into griefers because of boredom. I can't tell you how many players are trashing camps and messing with other players.
---
That's awesome! Hopefully you continue your work to eventually cover the entire map. That would be quite the undertaking though!
---
No, sucks, except Atom shop paint has the icon, so you know not to drop it :-)
---
In general, when trying to find out where to find plans, I recommend [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/174gcko5FeO-RLLwvAXB55v-3up_hXCrjCp5EGqOefzM/edit#gid=641493749) spreadsheet.
---
server hop and visit those easy locations until you find some. can be lvl 30-50
---
Yeah, having those recipes move to the top would be nice :)  The only downside is that you'd have to do something to make sure when you ran out of X, it doesn't auto-switch to something else.  Like if you have 2 recipes and you want to make ALL of the one at the top of the list and NONE of the second one, when you run out of components it doesn't poof, and then you're making the second one.
---
Well it's happening every time me or any of my friends go online and that's enough evidence I need. You can also find reports of it happening all over the internet and even the previous commenter who was defending it just admitted it does happen to them around workshops... Why are you trying to defend the game in its current state and argue about petty details like how many people it happens to? Like what is your motive to argue? I am having an issue with the game that is preventing me from playing/enjoying it. Even if it happens to a few people it is an issue and needs to be resolved. People like yourself trying to defend aspects of the game which are clearly flawed aren't doing this game or community any favours. It's an online game, that hasn't got stable servers, fix that as a priority and at least people can experience the game without having to constantly redo tasks. 4 times I had clear the airport because it kept disconnecting.
---
And i really hope it was not a 2 shot explosive one :D
---
hi, American here. I've been collecting the parts I need for the Excavator set for what feels like ages. Any tips? 
---
P.S. if you're on PC and want to team up I'm always looking for people to play with, as none of my friends play the game
---
Ouch. 1k I’ve seen but 1k plus mats? That’s extortion, man. I don’t have BOS shielded or I’d offer it myself. 
---
Using pistols, lvl25 Somerset revolver remained my preferred weapon up to a little after 40 when I started switching to rifles. 
---
Ive seen a lv 283 the other night
---
I got my All Rise too early in the game :( I think mine is like level 25.
---
I just hit level 35, not sure how many hours into the game i have but i've been playing every weekend since launch, although generally in the morning/afternoon. I play on PC and haven't experienced any griefing at all. no attempts at pvp, no one attacking my base, no nothing. Every interaction i've had with other players has been either beneficial or neutral. 
---
iirc the shareholders have approved a patch on the 19th
---
It's not, it would be nice though.  I carry two chassis on me, a t45 and the excavator.  The only reason I can tell them apart is from the tricentennial paint I have on the t45, it puts a little atom symbol next to the name.
---
Well, it already helps me, I'm sure it's going to help a lot of people.
---
North korea stole nuke codes
---
Calmex. My kingdom for Calmex. Or a crafting plan for it if such a thing exists.
---
Most others I have for sale/give away.
---
I'll have to check again when I get to log on, but there is also a farm area in the forest, I believe just north of the vault, that actually has regular cranberries growing.  I'll try to get the picture of the location 
---
Hey man, that's just like... your opinion
---
Its ridiculous whenever I sell one I have to pull 10 from stash drop all collect the extras replaced back to box....i think I charge low for all the work JUST to sell the power armor.
---
I'd put down real money for this
---
Yeah, it frustrates me, when they input "Easter Eggs" that kill chances of something being added.  
---
After they fix duping. They should make it pretty high lvl(125-150) tbh. Also they need to do something about the weapon and armor scaling past lvl 50. Lvl 200-300s are saying they deal less damage than when theyre were in the 50s-100 regrown. I too feel the same way. Also make all the drops scale off your level. I don’t want any lvl 14 legendary event boss’ surrounded by lvl 68 mobs. It’s really annoying. 
---
It's a tough ride, and yeah I'm looking for the exact attachments, hardened and reflex is the goal for sure.
---
Why do you want the suppressor if you don't mind me asking?
---
Love this map.... super helpful, but why is it only the one small area? Are you updating it for the whole map eventually?
---
1k is pretty affordable actually - you can use your Excavator as a fast mode travel machine, its really quite bad in the endgame for DR though.
---
Here's a link showing where the fever blossom is.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/HmMvUhb](https://imgur.com/gallery/HmMvUhb).  This one is needed for the challenge so it would be helpful for people to know.  
---
None of my CAMP items ever multiplied so that I had more than I stored, and its not like I coukd sell them even if they did. A known bug with CAMP would be an easy target to start working on the fix with. If the CAMP bug has duper items for me, delete them that's fine. I concede that if people got banned for that it would be cruel amd unnecessary, as long as they weren't trying to take advantage of it by selling things to other players. 
---
So I amend my statement to include that people taking advantage of duping bugs to sell duped items to other players should be banned.
---
Ultimately, I still think that trying to set up some kind of player based economy is a watse of time. There are too many crappy people in the world who are willibg to cheat who will ruin any such economy. At the point where people are charging thousands of caps for anything, the economy is already broken.
---
Bethesda is wasting so much time and energy trying to reinvent the MMORPG, when they should be focussing on fixing game bugs, improving server performance, and adding better story. 
---
hahaha - I don't even think I can spell Norwegian.   
---
I couldn't pass the joke opportunity, no worries about the dropped S :D
---
Don't even have one, chief. Sorry
---
A good gatling gun is probably the best heavy weapon right now. It has a low rate of fire (less ammo and less repair), almost no spin-up time and does the most damage.
---
No, it can be done, you just have to use the steel pillars.  
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1IDmWI2e6U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1IDmWI2e6U)  
---
Yup, if you buy the plan and try to read it and it doesn't let you.
---
In all seriousness, nope gotta remember unfortunately.
---
PC? I have 1, not gonna make a 45 set
---
That would take away the need to search for new random drops as you level up. That's a big part of the game. 
---
4k caps isn't 'easy'
---
See tho if they bring it back, and all the losers get it, then how will other people know how much better I am than them? Right now, all they have to do is look at my incredible Blackbird armor. 
---
Long may your love last &lt;3
---
there is a spawn place for it at solomond's pond, see it there a lot :)
---
That would have been bad. My neighbor is away for the holidays, and I'd have no one in the area to see my call for help! I'd probably have to respawn in town and walk back up, which would be a problem with my pants around my ankles. 
---
same happened to me this last weekend! i was cleaning out my stash and had a ton of plans, way too many stimpacks and purified waters and .38 ammo plus a couple lvl 5 legendaries i'd been hoarding for some unknown reason. 
---
I saw a level 1 at the vault and FT'd there to welcome them home with open arms and they... just.. never.. came ... out...
---
I ended up just dumping it all in the cash register at the Flatwoods church. 
---
How do you avoid losing any mutations? Do you just stop using Rad Aways? 
---
science vendor should sell antidotes
---
WHAT??  no nukes until 19th?
---
At the Grafton Train station vendor on PC
---
who needs blackbird paint when i haven't gotten decent power armor yet? 
---
I wandered into the Whitesprings area at around level 25 or 30. I thought it was fine. Top of the world was much easier, except for the approach from the south, which was the hardest journey I made before level 30. I don't think you mean to imply that the whole map should be easy and scare-free at level 30. If so, we disagree but I doubt you really want that.
---
They shouldn't make every area of the game easy and without challenge.
---
I really enjoy Fallout 76 because it will kick your ass and keeps you on your toes. If you want something easy wherever you go, then Elder Scrolls Online will let you wander almost anywhere at low level.
---
Oh thanks man.. could do more budget ahhaha
---
the one in front of v76 has a pretty low weight limit iirc
---
See, on the one hand I really appreciate what you did. From personal experience hunting for Emergency Protocols, it looks pretty much the same as my experience.
---
At the same time, WHY are people wasting time on figuring out Bethesda's **SHIT** recipe procurement system instead of demanding that Bethesda pull their head out of their ass and implement an actual working system. Because server hopping for mats is probably *THE* most asinine, idiotic, low-effort garbage I've seen for at least the last half a decade in gaming. 
---
Glad you got both. You are seriously the first person I have heard of that has got the Handmade plans at level 20. 
---
To be safe I would advise not going past level 19. 
---
Nah, damn robots took our jobs
---
I spam the CTRL key.  
---
PS4 :(
---
Mirelurk queens have a chance to drop the actual suit and helmet. I got both of mine on one queen kill. Dont know if it was really lucky or they come in a set.
---
So easy.

The string lights, and Randy the red-nosed radstag, are both atom shop items. But the hanging single bulb lights can change colors via terminal. 
---
until a stray shotgun pellet hits one of the million robots running around. Then it's a murder-themed death rave. 
---
I accidentally sold my Voice of Set. Didn't have enough caps to buy it back. Made my day when I found 2 whole sets of MoM gear someone had sold at the vendor in Watoga. Got my pistol back and now I have an extra sword since they break on me all the time. 
---
Anglers!
---
Thank you. Does this mean that what kind you get is completely random, and isnt tied to a spot or location?
---
I've actually never traded anything in 170ish hours of play.
---
Bethesda could I feel try to identify those selling duplicated explosive weapons on eBay by posing as a customer and getting their gamer tag, if someone says they have 10x explosive shotgun etc they didn’t just happen upon then
---
wouldn't be such a problem if scrapping pa parts unlocked PA mods like with armor, especially since there are PA crafting perks
---
Not generous just over weight full of duped items. 
---
Why did they let duping get this out of hand.  :(
---
Okay that's really solid advice, but where do you find the T60 calibrated shocks so easily?
---
This exactly the phrase I should have used in my title. Thank you!
---
My Luck is only 8, Id probably DC long before i got 76
---
Is...is that seriously what happened? Did they genuinely not account for the year rollover when creating the weekly events?
---
I'm guessing you didn't notice in defense section that there are large concrete walls that snap together real nicely. Way better than old junk walls. Just expensive.
---
They can be height adjusted easily, and can snap in 90° or best of all 45° angles. They cost a lot of budget and WAAAAY too many concrete, so I can't get my whole base fortressed in unless I give up my turrets.
---
Still, they are a godsend for workshops. Wall in the resource extractor, use a tall power conduit, and players and enemies alike are stuck.
---
lets take a 2 or 3 rings away from the bursts they already spam it enough
---
I have done the scorched queen encounter and nuked whitesprings many times in both fully modded X-01 and Excavator and there wasn't really a big difference in the amount of stimpacks I used. Popping Radaway is more of a concern than damage from mobs. They also seem to go forever without needing repair.
---
Right? I played this game literally every day since release, go out of town for like 3 days and missed this one. Really wish they would do specials like this for more than a 48 hour time chunk (or however long it was up for). 
---
They are planning a hotfix at some point today, according to one of the bethesda reddit users. Will try to find comment. 
---
Strange i had a history teacher that said this too, i think he said it carried over from his service in the coast guard. 
---
They are investigating the issue. https://twitter.com/bethesdasupport/status/1080188836993515521?s=21
---
I have a feeling we'll get an npc DJ once other vaults open or Rose brings the raiders back.
---
Ya. I’d prefer they do more damage and less frequently. Or a decreased visual effect.
---
i'm only level 35 so one-hitting legendaries is not an option atm, but i will def keep it in mind!
---
That's pretty rad! 
---
I might have to make some modifications to make mine a bit less square, lol
---
Just came here to ask this. Very frustrating :(
---
Lvl 27, so watch out lol.
---
The point of making ti wasn't exclusivity for the handful of folks who caught it in the store, it was to make money.  They need to put it back up in order to recoup and eventually profit on the work put into making it.
---
Quality post thanks for your time/effort
---
yeah, that is about the same i have seen, except for the "red tactical" i dont see that one a lot, and it is actually very good, gives better light at close distances, and can't be seen by enemies, a "must have"  :)
---
It means it is better than your currently equipped weapon.
---
Starched genes perk level 2
---
Multi million dollar company can’t get the dates right. Lol
---
Wait for a whitesprings nuke zone.........you get a commendation for every legendary you kill.  There are legendaries everywhere in whitesprings.  Easy completion.
---
For scorchbeasts you need to start trading for better legendary weapons.  Two shot, explosive, bloodied, whatever the damage increase with each hit one is, etc.  They have lots more armor and take more time to kill.
---
Once I got some good mutations and legendary weapons on my melee character, I can melt any scorchbeast (except queen) if they land in like 4 seconds.  The problem is getting them to land....lol
---
You got any gears? Or any idea how to get a ton
---
They all do now.  I think the limit is 40.  Luckily, there are quite a few corpses in the church and tavern in Flatwoods.
---
I believe you can buy duplicates 
---
I mean, that seems to be the most likely reason. Why else would the reset timers change to “9999 hours 0 mins” when the New Year hit?
---
I probably just got lucky, but after server hopping Chad in Camden Park for awhile, he had 2 shocks for Excavator at the same time.
---
that's just it server hoping for mods isn't intended but isn't something that can be patched out easily either. your supposed to get a random vendor inventory each day and that's it but because vendor inventory is tied to each individual server you can hop to find what the other servers are selling 
---
You can 100% buy the same plan.
---
that's why i always use the cash registers in front of the vendor bot. haven't run into a weight limit issue yet
---
Eventually yes this is 6 hours of work
---
What S.P.E.C.I.A.L does that perk fall under? 
---
The name will say Legendary, or (if it's a boss also) will have stars after the name.
---
So weird. I think perhaps as soon as they begin they show up on the map so all the tome making their character and stuff they appear ok the map maybe. Idk! Hopefully they found the goodies anyway :) 
---
I’m in an end game group that basically only launches nukes and they’re all just playing other games. Not a good look, Bethesda.
---
huntersville
---
That damage is still about 8 times a normal shotgun, so its a good find regardless.
---
Well it's not in my head, if I'm contesting a workshop against someone and that guy has +25% dmg on his rifle then that's clearly unfair.
---
So my original point was these shouldn't be added, but if they are we'll be highly compelled to use them.
---
So you used a broken PvP system and someone’s ignorance of game mechanics to beat them by baiting them into attacking you with slap damage so you could get the first shot with high powered weapons. Then you came to Reddit seeking approval and a pat on the back for it. 
---
What a douchecanoe. Hope you got the self esteem bump that you needed though. 
---
Thanks for the answer!
---
Nope, pity it is such a broken PVP experience where the after game end game seems to revolve around griefing for bored max levels.
---
Like I said I have zero issue with PVP, but slapping it over a SP with Co OP elements game is just a shitty experience. Besides it is absolutely no different from many 2016 games which offer the same griefing opportunities. Even some of those games offer official and non official PVE only servers. Cos, you know, they realize people into griefing have more time on their hands than casuals.
---
Besides not much of that "ample information" mentioned griefers interfering with the storyline. I honestly don't see anywhere in the promo material that griefers would get the higher priority in game experience. In fact I recall it being advertised as solo/Co OP with opt in PVP.
---
https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-12-21-fallout-76-multiplayer-pvp-5076
---
They already prevent PVP to above level 5. Why not gate it further? 
---
completely unrelated to the post... just wanted to share also... been thinking what happened here [https://imgur.com/a/Wzw8jdD](https://imgur.com/a/Wzw8jdD) 
---
Eventually lol that small area took 6 hours 
---
Even when you really didn't want to...
---
I would like this but you would need rules such as no tar weapons because it will one shot anyone despite level and if two people went at it it would be whoever could get a hit off first
---
go with the lvl ones. if you want develop alt lvl 3 sluggers to use against the queen, and drop blocker for that fight
---
Yao Guai usually drop them. Seneca rocks visitor center often has a couple yau guai hanging around.
---
On ps4? I’ll give a gift in return
---
I paid 250 per leg for ultracite shocks. Lol. Fallout market is great. But man people want some insane prices for stuff. If you aren't selling duped goods, it's hard to stack caps. First time I went to buy serum recipe I saved for almost two weeks to get cap limit. Then find out people are selling duped recipes for 5k a piece. After I've already spent 19,000 twice for recipes. Not to mention the hundreds of server hops to get one to show up. 
---
Well it’s not exactly hard to get all of the mutations in the game at once and with a max Class Freak card the buff to the special points far outweighs the negative effects. I can’t believe people are running around without mutations.
---
Thanks! Didn’t know that. 
---
Sample size 100.  
---
Implies %'s are meaningful.  
---
LOL.
---
Any word on a time for this?
---
I completely forgot about perks! Thank you very much.
---
Thanks for the tip ill add it in when i get the interactive set up
---
You understand it was 18 months because they reused a shitton of assets from 3 right
---
I second this.
---
And as someone who prefers wood walls to brick ones, I would buy nice wood walls from the atoms store. No point in getting the nice wooden floors while my camp wood walls are so ramshackle.
---
I also want hanging planters.
---
LOL :D
---
I always find this so interesting to hear. I did this as well and never really talked to anyone about it. Seems like a very common thing. I always imagined a ninja on roller blades. 
---
You should add me for this on Xbox I would love to participate. My gamertag is Kuso24
---
Bigger stash is definitely my #1 request.  Loving the game right now except for that.
---
If they're having problems with database recall times / lag, they can always do this:
---
All Junk, Ammo, and Aid (without condition bars) is unlimited. It doesn't take any more time for a database to recall 10 steel as it does 1,000 steel. It's a line item name and a numerical value.
---
Since there are so many variants and conditions of armor and weapons and food items (literally millions if you take all the variables in), make that a FIXED number of slots in your stash (as many as they can get in there without lag).  So you could store 100 armor or weapons or food items.
---
If it's a database retrieval problem, that would fix it :)
---
Cool
---
Yeah, that could work. Especially since they are planning to do perk layouts soon, just equip that layout for when I face scorch beasts. 
---
No worries. Same thing for armor btw. It has a higher damage resistance than the piece you currently have equipped. 
---
Came here to say this.  Have a "claim a porch" system, or even "rebuild" the motel there to have claimable rooms. Same rules as current camps - you can have a vending machine/bot there, you set the prices, but can only sell while online.  Make flatwoods a free travel spot.  Put a lower weight limit into the machines (200?) to help stability.   
---
And give us the ability to "bulk" ammo into ammo crates for sale.
---
Litterally happened to me. Was singing Country Roads in my base. Someone walked by sang a bit with me then left. Was really confused why they did that until I noticed my mic was on.
---
That's fantastic! Remember the location?
---
Level 21 mole-rats for me... at level 94 :(
---
I don't know about stacking, but I have had players occasionallh tell me even after I stopped crouching and was trying to be seen. 
---
Definitely no tse, or maybe for high levels, one round of only tse and make it like a western duel haha
---
I would try and buy a 50 version from someone. It's weight alone is impressive. Add the percentage card for Mele swing speed increase.
---
PC 
---
weird graphic bug in start screen and when i try to start the game i only get disconnected from the server
---
never had any problems before pc is a bit old but other games run fine without graphic bugs
---

---
Same. I just recently got access to silos before new years, and I'm a little miffed that I can't do anything to xp grind anymore.
---
The plans and mods in my experience are not tied to the server. I've hopped back into the same server that my friend stayed on and get different plans/mods. Vendor plans/mods seem to be tied to each login to a server.
---
76 is a copy paste of 4 including objects you can’t use like dog armour but it’s still its own game. What’s your point? Asset reuse is completely fine when given such a small time frame. Who cares if the RPG elements and story are great which they are.
---
Lost progress but still lost stimpaks.... interesting. How does that work
---
I am at the Xbox one x and I crash constantly when I open my weapons tab.
---
With the emotes ofc. I turned voice chat off on launch day and now it won't come back on, no matter how I change my settings.
---
Correct. Until we get a better trading system (which is on its way) and as long as the vendors are your best bet you get the mod you want/need, there is no other way of doing it.
---
I appreciate your time and effort but 100 is a pretty small sample size. 1000 trials would probably be more accurate. It took me me weeks with way over 100 different servers to find my jetpack.
---
So op
---
Go to White springs golf-course...Go through the door that activates the trap, run back out the door and jump up on the ledge and kill....rinse, repeat....just make sure you have plenty of ammo.  
---
I ran into several growing around Arktos Pharma last night.
---
Incisor and martial arts are the only damage perks you NEED. I used to run unarmed I do so Manucho dmg now it’s just a waste of a perk to increase it by even 10% just give me the armor piercing and we’re good.
---
no
---
I used to hear random stuff in area during the beta but not since. 
---
Scrolling text? Please no. :P
---
I'd much prefer just have a little button over there "Patch Notes", and when you click it, it opens up a window  (preferably in-game, not the web browser - I'm not keen on having to alt-tab even on PC, and that barely works at all on consoles).
---
I use an Assassin shadowed wood leg. Kinda sucks but whatever. Maybe I should figure out how damage resist actually works and do some calculation to see if it actually works out better or worse.
---
Oh wow. Yeah that’s some serious inflation there, serums usually go for like 1-2k. I don’t really farm much, and don’t dupe, so I pretty well stay broke. 
---
Dots on the compass for non-existent olayers too. That *could* be a general bug, but I've only seen it in power armour. Walking towards the dot doesn't ever actually reach it either.
---
Also the teamate bars and the food/water are all hidden behind the UI. I've gotten used to just third-personing in PA now.
---
Can you build a room around the workbench of out curiosity? Or maybe even put up a bunch of concrete security walls? I don't do a whole lot of workshops so I am not sure. Even when I did it was mainly to get recipe/plans rewards.
---
PS4 thank you though!

Just get a marine tactical helmet and craft a bunch to sell, only takes like 1 glass and 1 rubber and 3 plastic. Has a value of your 130 and can easily get 35 for them at vendors. Or keep green thumb equipped and just grabbed every berry and flower you pass, blackberries sell for 2 caps and you get 2 each time you pick, most clumps have 4 or 5 to pick and they are everywhere
---
Feral ghouls and ,since it was in the bog, about 3 scorchbeasts
---
That’s what I was thinking. Should all remain with one perk or should I put three in the first and one points in the other two?
---
Oh I know that, they just made out it was tamable. There's a crashed vertibird at the north zof the map, east of the fissure that is a spawn location for tamabke. The sloth is level 20 and deathclaw 21. Only problem is where its located, they always have to pass somewhere dangerous on route to your camp. 
---
One of the biggest BS moments I experienced was when a player with an entourage of four others took my workshop without going hostile or anything, then I attempted to take it back and instantly went hostile, lighting me up like a Christmas tree.
---
That doesn’t really prove anything. It’s just a dude using trash weapons and then using an explosive weapon. Any rifle/shotty/heavy will do that even faster.
---
I think most mutations will make do without offensive auras:
---
 Adrenal Reaction : Visible veins
---
 Bird Bones : Skinny Char
---
 Carnivore : Protruding fang
---
 Chameleon : Chameleon's chromatography effect (skin subtly constantly changing color)
---
 Eagle Eyes : Eagle iris
---
 Egg Head : Head mesh become more rounded and bigger
---
 Electrically Charged : Sporadic visible sparks around body
---
 Empath : Antennas that light up when partied
---
 Grounded : Electricity running from feet to ground when walking
---
 Healing Factor : Buffed char, more visibly muscular
---
 Herbivore : Rabbit teeth?
---
 Herd Mentality : Two heads?
---
 Marsupial : Tail 
---
 Plague Walker : Subtle locust aura
---
 Scaly Skin : Well, scaly skin
---
 Speed Demon : Pale, chemical burned looks
---
 Talons : Hands that look like bird feet
---
 Twisted Muscles : Misshaped muscle tones
---
 Unstable Isotope : Cracked skin with green, glowing effects
---
FYI it's just damage per shot, it's not damage per second or any other more appropriate calculation.  
---
I think it would be fun if people could make their own stations...
---
I will definitely make note of that 
---

I love the game, but this mechanic is nuts.  I server hopped for a while to get the jet pack and ultimately gave up and bought it from someone.  I could've spent that time working a second job at McDonald's and at least I would've had free fries to show for it.
---
The assets from 4, the greenhouse pieces from contraptions, still are in the ESM, and are marked POST as well, which is a decent sign that they'll be added as free content.
---
Well if you have a anti armor melee then just do 2 incisor but if you don’t go all 3. Also 3 martial artist too every time. 
---
They are aware and investigating the issue. https://twitter.com/bethesdasupport/status/1080188836993515521?s=21
---
Yup. I'm actually on rn
---
&gt; First, you shouldn't be able to target friendlies in VATS at all, let alone in pacifist mode.
---
100% this. It's such a pain in the ass. 
---
A timer on that flag would be smart, so I can't just grief them whenever and 'bank' it, but absolutely I'm tired of my shit gettin jacked by people who didn't even do anything and I can't even have a chance to get it back, regardless if I'll murder then or not in pvp
---
So far my solution is a bloodied buzz blade or ripper. Does a high amt of slap damage and will proc unstable or elec charge if they run that which will immediately cause them to be flagged and melted.
---
Luck
---
Does lucky Break work with power armor?
---
I feel like all players should've been given one free full respec to rearrange your points however you deemed fit, after the update dropped. Personally i thought it was like fallout 4, where eventually you'd be able to get everything. So i was wasting my points on stuff i wanted at the time rather than a good build to use for end game. By the time the update dropped to respec i was level 80 and it takes forever to level up and move one point.
---
Thanks for this.  Wasn’t sure if it was worth looking into these treasure maps.
---
Awesome, thank you.
---
Lol yeah. I'm a little upset about actually spending the resources on them haha
---
This was the last Inside the Vault. More to come this month. https://bethesda.net/en/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019
---
Brick windows are the better compared to wood. You can build a wire thru the opening in brick windows, but since wood can open and close, the isn't possible. Makes wiring stuff easier 
---
I was having issues with push to talk at first with my mouse. Even using the hotkey on the keyboard it would show the speaker flickering in 3rd person. I normally only play 1st person and had to go to 3rd also to make sure I was actually communicating. 
---
So who’s building the arena
---
Not sure it was more there for normal armour 
---
No, it's not. I spent most of my pre-50 time using just basic modded armor and weapons.
---
Hi,
---
For those experiencing this issue, could you please provide me with your Bethesda.net username if seeing it on PC or your gamertag/PSN  ID if seeing it on console so we can investigate?
---
I said it wasn't supposed to be though...
---
Omg yes. Almost everything barring scorchbeasts are killed instantly within one or two shots of my double barrel exposive shotgun. Fucking gulpers do now
---
Make sure you're using WHITE KNIGHT and FIX IT GOOD.  With those 2 perks on it costs 1 ballistic fiber to repair each piece, doubles the durablity, and increases the damage resist (damage resist increase stays until it gets from 200% to 99% durability, then fix it again and it's back).
---
that is awesome.
---
I had the same issue, and the quest will re-appear once you start the Brotherhood quest line at Fort Defiance.
---
If you are already pursuing the BOS line, then try logging completely off, and it should come back when you log back in again.
---
That would be fun just with my tse gauss rifles trying to flick shot the other guy lmao. I can help u out with this if u want and we could only do people within 10 levels of each other(10-19,20-29, etc) so it’s fair 
---
They took our jerbs!
---
No and that was never going to be the case. There are Atom shop images for packs of one, three, and five lunchboxes datamined. It’s not just something they’re giving away, it’s something that they planned to sell in packs.

What? What the fuck is this thing? Ya got some kind of Martian sex machine, you sick fuck? Uh, uh. No way.
---
[Angry alien babble, electrical shock]
---
Ahh! God DAMNIT! Fuckin' crazy-ass Moon Man! Go ahead! Do your worst!
---
Gaaaaahh!! Jesus H! Do you not get it, space cadet? I. Do. Not. Fucking. Understand. What. You. Want. Me. To. Do!
---
This thing? This? What? Talk? I am talking! What do you want me to say?!
---
[Commanding alien babble]
---
Blah, blah, blah, yakkety, yakkety! That all you assholes can say?! Space men with all this science, and you can't even speak fuckin' English!?
---
Okay, how's about this: my name is Vin. I am on a fucking UFO. I'm from Flatbush, and I want to get home. Can I get a taxi, please? How's that? Huh? That work for ya, starstruck? What? Don't you raise that fuckin' thing to me again... No, you're gonna hit me again! Is that...?
---
[Alien babble, electronic shock]
---
Argh, son of a-- Why don't you go back to Uranus, huh? Ha, ha, ha...
---
[Electronic shock, scream]
---
If it talked anything like the vendors I’d never use the damn thing.
---
Summersville might be what you are looking for. Mobs scale to the level of the first person in to the area when the mobs spawn, so be careful. If a higher level person ran through they could be extra tough.  spoilers in the link, you have been warned.  http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Summersville
---
You have contracted scurvy.
---
That still strikes me as a weird assumption though.  If you were to ask me what determined weapon degradation, I would naturally assume it was based on the number of times you fired, not how often you hit.
---
I don't. I've run into less than five people with mics who wanted to talk on Xbox.
---
Whats ur gt
---
Yeah not been to fort defiance yet I only stated it after finding the army camp 
---
Im not critiquing it. Im saying that its disingenuous to claim its the nest game made in such a short time when that time wouldve been much longer if they didnt reuse assets
---
Not that I'm against finding these spots on my own, but that page is greatly appreciated. I have way to many.,
---
K i added u, my gt is asian meme lord
---
Yeah I have a pretty good amount of gears, desk fans are a great way to get more
---
There's also the fun ones where there's misnamed plans. Like the three versions of Barn Buildings. One of which is actually the barn walls. The other two are defense fortifications and advanced power conduits.
---
=D okay have a good day
---
Yeah, you can buy them from the atomic shop for 8000 atoms each!
---
I got lucky on my first day playing and got two leather chest pieces with it. 
---
Few things ive noticed:
---
1. Very useful against mobs, use it to great effect to do BoS quest early and sneak around plenty of scorchbeasts.
---
2. The visual doesnt stack but im unsure if the sneak bonus it implies does stack or not.
---
3. When switching weapons while crouched the weapon becomes visible but you do not, so be very careful if using in pvp.
---
4. Line of sight is a bit glitchy still but for the most part as long as your behind something or under something then any monsters/mobs even after noticing you can easily be escaped from and will make you hidden again. Robots can be an exception more often than not, unsure if this is on purpose or a glitch.
---
Which one? I'd like to relisten.
---
They addressed your issue.  Keeping the ticket open wouldn't help would it?  That really sucks though... i'd be upset if i had so many bugged.  I only have one fortunately.  Hopefully there'll be a fix soon.  I know they have acknowledged the issue and said they're working on it.
---
Make sure to do most of the missions through flatwoods, they give some pretty necessary building plans. 
---
That's a long ass time ago.
---
You sure they said they give you a refund?
---
BGS Maryland is the studio that'd be doing ES6 and Starfield, whereas BGS Austin is the studio that's meant to be doing 76 updates, both smaller updates and larger "story beats", or updates that add a lot. So, it's not impossible so much as dependent on what they think the best direction for the story is.

Many times I will be doing something and not see the invite, but will suddenly see the "you declined the team invite" pop up, and I'm like... What invite? And of course, you open the social menu and there is nothing there.
---
There should be a history menu, or missed invites menu. 
---
I can,  but i dont have alot of plans, so ill see if anyone wants to help
---
Thanks for the offer! My budget's maxxed at the moment but after I've gained a few more levels I'll probably take you up on it :) I don't do in-game voice chat but if you'd like to catch me on Discord I'll PM you a link to our server; just let me know!
---
People found some different ways to give someone else an item without losing it from their own inventory, involving containers, logouts, etc. So they go back and forth multiplying their items over and over.
---
Yea I suppose we should wait and see before we wildly speculate that this will never be updated and go free to play and bethesda never wants to make money anymore so they just made the worst game in all of history and so now everyone hates them oh and they are now suicidal and the community feels better about it because Red dead, atlas, &lt;insert game&gt; has fewer bugs and hundreds of hours more in content.
---
Thanks so much.
---
Does pacifist negate shooting the monster?
---
How much ? 
---
Grafton in the north of the map, has 2 events that can be easily done and a bunch of level 10-15 super mutants, grafton steel works has loads of level 10 super mutants and you can capture the workshop for steel and lead to craft ammo
---
This is actually a big thing. I didnt know this until lv 50. Even when you know it can be hard to spot.
---
Hi sorry for the late reply.
---
For weight I only have the chem-weight reduction card and the food-weight reduction card.
---
Im on PS4 :P
---
You can in some workshops, but a lot of them are awkwardly placed. The bigger issue is that no matter what you build, you won’t get warned until someone hits claim. You’d still have to check the map and see someone with a bounty to get any advance notice. What I usually do is build a lot of locked doors with barricades on both sides to stack up bounty for attackers and try to check in once every so often. 
---
It’s not perfect, but I’ve only had a few times where a workshop I built up has been taken out from under me. Once it gets taken, all those defenses wind up screwing me over. So the goal is to make it so that if someone breaks in, I can get there before they seal all the entrances and I don’t have to get a bounty to get in. 
---
&gt; The other two are defense fortifications and advanced power conduits.
---
Oh that's why I don't know how to make power conduits...
---
Uh, won't the explosions hit you at shotgun range?
---
I have fond memories of when I made an OnHit : Fireball sword in Neverwitner Nights to much the same effect lol.
---
Source?
---
Hey hows ur building skills?
---
Lmfaooo 
---
Side question are you on Xbox ?
---
Or maybe they saw the possibility of a backlash and decided not to implement them into the game, or maybe they were never ment to be in the game, or maybe they still will implement them someday.
---
Just hop in your time machine and start noting down which plans you learn as you go.
---
Morgan town air port east side hasba event called collision course or something with qaves of scorched. 
---
Beat them all finish event collect the supply drop relog and do it again.  
---
 You can run routes between billings home stead, possideon energy, geroges junkyard owning all three workshops.
---
Interesting, there was a level 82 before i arrived. 
---
Honestly I don't miss people constantly nuking the whitespring (my camp is nearby) I do miss queen runs though.
---
I found one treasure on my own and it took so long that I think I’ll cheat the next ones with your link lol 
---
I’m just terrible at it I guess. Was more frustrating than anything for me.
---
Hey no problem. In the time between posts ive accumulated a few more stealthy pieces. Im on ps4 as well!
---
Whats your gamertag ill send ya a friend request and meet you sometime in game
---
Wood armors are to amp up sneak and stealth. I never tested it extensively but the free state quest said you can even hide from SB with it. 
---
Not having text chat is idiotic.
---
Not having Push to talk at launch was idiotic.
---
Even with push to talk, the present handling of voice chat is idiotic. (Options of No Voice, hearing Local, but not hearing your team, hearing your team and local but only able to speak to your team, or no voice. A situation easily solved by having an option for 2  Push-To-Talk buttons, for Local and for Team.)
---
There are so many things wrong with the multiplayer experience, and communication is a big one.
---
I can see the colors on my phone.
---
Why would people trade duped items though? They already have caps from the thousands of Nuka Colas they have.
---
I had snallygasters.  Left with a ton of acid, so it actually wasn't bad.
---
Child like lol
---
I had a sword in Destiny with reduced recoil when aiming down sights.
---
RNG loot systems at their finest. I've made similar loot systems myself, and its a pain, but yeesh.
---
Stack. But multiplicatively not additively. 
---
Herbivore here, corn soup is easy to make and satisfies both thirst/hunger so its what i role with. although "the double bonuses" dont seem to add up since 5 x 20 %= 100% but it can take more than 5 servings of soup to satisfy my thirst because tons of fun needs to whale up and eat 50033 calories a day.
---
Primarliy it's a Hunter's arm, most three star legendary names seem to be based on common legendaries first.  Also gives +1 agility.
---
Actually, yes. 100 is enough to estimate a percentage. At 1000 or 10000 you just get more accurate figures.
---
Feeling pretty dumb about now.... :)
---
If you have at least 10 Acid, you have infinite acid (or at least, limited only by your Plastic). Bulk Acid requires 10 Acid to craft, but scraps to 15. Craft, scrap, repeat.
---
THIS. Start ALL OVER again, balance weapons, and open up PvP.
---
What’s your gamertag? I’ve been looking for someone to play with.
---
I will never understand this mindset as it applies to this game (makes sense in MMOs and other online games though). Now-traditional game-mechanics-wise it makes sense, but in a milieu of post-apoc mod/upgrade/scavenge, why am I looking for a new gun/machining a new gun, when I could be carrying my first -working- gun to level 50?
---
From today i will Downvote every Post saying "I akzually laik tHis GAme"
---
Considering you’re a heavy build, I would probably take some points away from Intelligence. Def want a 15 strength. Look for adrenaline and Tenderizer (Charisma) I think this will help you a lot. Personally I find addictol everywhere in this game, so I feel like you could be using those 2 endurance points on something more useful like increasing strength during the day time. Just some thoughts, your intelligence does not need to be so high since half the perks you’re using only work while crafting/repair 
---
I did it a couple times today, got several honeybeast spawns per hive, sometimes with yao guai.
---
Possible that a lower level player went through the event or something? Or just unlucky spawns.
---
Anti armor gatling really helps, though a 2 shot is super inaccurate at range.
---
Well, to play the devil's advocate, why do we need random vendor inventory each day? That's there to be gained by doing it? As opposed to each vendor having one of everything, at all times?
---
Normal response would be so that we trade with other players. But the game doesn't give us the tools to do so - there's no global text trade chat where you can easily link items, there's no auction house where players can browse everyone else's offerings. They recently announced player vendoring, but if it is what I think it is, it'll just be a station/bot in your camp selling stuff, which is even worse than server hopping because A) there's no guarantee player has it and B) everyone's camps will be all over the damn place. So that clearly doesn't work.
---
Server hopping, right now, is mandatory because of how badly the game is designed. Like, world loot and enemy spawns. I'm on a lvl 24 alt, I walk into a location, and enemies are lvl 68, because a lvl 200 ran through 10 mins ago and spawned them, but didn't kill them. So...that's not great. I can do lvl 68s, mind you, but if they're Mr. Gutsy Colonels or something, that's too much work. Then, I go to loot the place, but the good stuff is already looted by the lvl 200 that ran through it. So I expended massive amount of resources, and got no loot. Why? Because Bethesda. By contrast, look at Elder Scrolls Online. The enemies, the entire world, is scaled to player. If you're lvl 24, the whole world is lvl 24. What's more, a lvl 24 can group with a lvl 50, and have a good time, because the same enemy will, to me, appear as lvl 24, and to my lvl 50 friend they'll be lvl 50. And when these enemies die, I'll get lvl 24 loot, and he gets lvl 50 loot. And commensurate amount of XP. And everybody is happy. Whereas in FO76 I killed those lvl 68s, and I  got loot I won't be able to use for another 20 levels! Same with world loot, in ESO world loot is instanced to each player. See that piece of bread on the table? I can pick it up, and it disappears. But to another player, next to me, the bread is still there, he can loot it too. So when one player clears a location, another player coming in right behind him isn't left standing with their dick in their hands, they get loot too. And that game is almost half a decade old. And none of those ideas were new, even back then.
---
This game's systems, at the very core, are **SHIT**. And we should be pushing to have that changed and brought up to at least 2008 standards, if not 2014 standards. Not figuring out how to best work within the broken, shit system given to us for an obscene (relative to quality of the product) amount of money.
---
Im on PC. Decimator931, at work atm so i can't log in if needed.
---
The bug where everything freezes when I quit the game is back
---
I understand what you're saying. I'm actually adding more data as I make more visits to the Enclave. Really wish the server loading times were shorter and the vendor were closer to the entrance though :-D
---
And would it be the same time-traveling Sally?
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Alien_captive_recorded_log#Alien_captive_recorded_log_21
---
No, it doesn't help.
---
This guy...
---
this hasn't been my experience but maybe i was just getting the same inventory each time idk 
---
It's cool how you play fetch with him.
---
A lot of the enemies are swarms, I'm melee because I'm not really into fighting games and never play FPS, I just want to explore, but being melee isn't necessarily easy I often get swarmed by lots of high level enemies and can only hit one at a time and the super sledge is slow so I take a lot of damage between swings.
---
If you want the challenge you can use a low level melee weapon or don't invest in melee perks but personally I like it as it is, not all players want challenging battles some of us just want to walk into blast zones for the flux. 
---
That area should be a guaranteed deathclaw spawn without the event, so I guess with it it just spams the deathclaws...good to know.
---
My preferred way when I didn't. Have better guns. Plus 2shot bprs can go for 1k caps or less in the marketplaces. And they hit like trucks while still being pretty accurate.
---
Yeh i wonder if its a bug where if you played beta you now cant talk to people 🤣 just like I will never leave the vault according to my acheivements.
---
PA and carry weight is in a weird place imo. I use a bloodied/low hp build. So I have 5 unyielding armor pieces as well just to take advantage of that low hp. Nice for even the CHA boost when using vendors.
---
However, outside my PA I have like 415ish max carry weight thanks to deep pocketed, +15 str from the unyielding gear, and +5 str from Radicool.
---
Only my excavator armor brings my max carry higher than that. My X-01 set with calibrated T-60 still falls short.
---
I'm not sure if reduced weight legendary perks stack (although, I think they probably do), but I'm pretty certain they at least stack with perks that do similar weight reduction.
---
Perfect rolled legendary armor can potentially be more beneficial than PA from it looks like. Only problem is it's very RNG dependent and you still have rad resistance to worry about, and PA/Hazmat suits have hidden reductions beyond their shown rad resistances.
---
If that 35% weapon reduction is max level, and even if you don't use it, someone will likely pay for it.
---
I got the plans to the entire T 51b T 60 and marine armor including helmet and wetsuit from treasure maps as well as a bunch of other stuff 
---
SubparChase. I have too! Its so lonely. I usually play at night.
---
Do you really want this game to die? 
---
Three Dog!
---
I agree.  Those DJ's from FO4 / NV were the only reason I turned on my pip boy radio from time to time.  Would be nice to hear those guys again.  Remember the stadium guy in FO4 and the problems he was having?  Hilarious!
---
Why is it unfair? you have the option to get that same advantage, or an advantage mroe fitting of your playstyle. But choosing to play the game on a harder "difficulty" would have been your own choice.
---
How about being able to attack someone that took your loot when you died and had to respawn? That’s happened a few times and they just spam douchey emotes when you try to get it back because you do hardly any damage.
---
Honestly the problem isn't that melee is to strong, but rather guns are too weak/fragile depending on what it is, and the whole 'shoot fast shoot weak' bullshit needs to get remove, high rate of fire weapons have horrendously large amounts of muzzle climb (LMG climbs faster than a Sherpa in the Alps) and has notably more expensive/heavier ammo than the .50 HMG, but does less than half the dmg per shot, while having aprox half the magazine capacity.
---
And don't get me started on how fast energy weapons break, my Prime Executioners gat plas breaks before I go through a full core, from full (100%) repair
---
It felt plausible, some of them were holiday themed so I guess I expected them to be free. Seems you may be right
---
They have something like it in the code already. When I craft a machete it says Lvl 1, but has a second menu where I can choose higher levels if I have the knowledge. They should be able to add a Lvl 2 version of the recipe that uses purified water instead.
---
There are nuka darks in game.  
---
Woaw that makes a lot of sense
---
You can't. No trading atom painted power armor.
---
It’s rare you’ll find a full set, there’s a good spot to put your camp (image attached) that has a junk deposit at the top of the field next to the bee hive and there’s a barn at the bottom of the field with power armour, just check it whenever you log in, have a full set in no time.

I'm wondering what you ninja looted that off of, lol.
---
I know if you get insanely quick you see and grab  the dead enemies inventory before it switches over to their actual loot, but never seen one with a behemoth attack.

Thats alright haha ill find a high level
---
Fallout 4 was offline, Fallout 76 is online. I don’t think there is a single app for any single online RPG game that updates in real time &amp; allows you to change armor, weapons &amp; I believe you can use items also but I could be wrong. Bethesda needs to focus on fixing 76 before they focus on building an app. 
---
I mean, there was that huuuuge push for automation in Appalachia, and even when doing the nuke launch you only need 1 human, the robots do everything else for you
---
It’s cool I didn’t know either
---
Lmao I've accidentally shot high level players and they came down on me with hellish fury so I second this 
---
Add antiarmor and it barely takes a magazine with timed shots 
---
Such a wasted opportunity!
---
You can find raw mats around fissures if humour truly obsess over challenges
---
Hasn't been easy. I basically keep an eye on what people are paying decent prices for. Then try to farm for that. I find low level players like to buy armor and gun plans and I know where to farm those pretty well. But I sell shit cheap. I'm. It gonna sell a marine tactical helm plan I picked up while running around playing the game for 1K caps. Serums are useless for selling now. Specially with people selling recipes for so extremely cheap. Fallout market is just flooded with people advertising serums. 
---
so cool
---
I believe aliens experimented on Sally to the point that she became immortal. It's hard to find human children now, so maybe that's why they don't brutally torture her  and let her run about the spaceship.(before she gets caught of course)
---
Good God
---
Yay! I’ll add you. My gamertag is the same as my Reddit username.
---
I also leveled up while wearing a beer hat and it still says 0/5. Uuggghhhh
---
It does exist bro. You can get it by turning in tech data but haven’t been lucky enough to get it
---
I still think a central warehouse store where ALL plans and mods are available for purchase would be better than the daily vendor merry go round/server hopping to find plans for things like a freaking brick wall. If Bethesda somehow thinks throttling the plans and mods balances the game, they are wrong. I honestly believe the end game for them is to “sell” plans and mods for Atoms, regardless of what they said. 
---
My guess is you are asking about the handmade plans. I leveled a new toon to 15 and hiked all the way there and the plans were there, I have never seen them after ever, I could have just been really lucky seeing them first try, or really unlucky never seeing them again, or both.
---
Sometimes I wonder if this entire game is some kind of social experiment or something. I mean, this *has* to be trolling!

---
Oh I am high level,l player, just not a high level builder 
---
Well, you can moan all you like. Better clear your inventory of that steel and wood when Bethesda actually do this.
---
By the way, every single weight management guide says to never keep more than 100-200 steel and wood as more than that is just deadweight you hoarder.
---
Awesome! I'll look out for you if and when I get one.
---
So I was playing that quest yesterday with two teammates, and all the enemies were non-legendaries. None of us were particularly interested in pvp so it was a bit of a boring quest. 
---
Did we miss something? 
---
Yes that’s the one
---
Yep we sit side by side and game together \^\^
---
\*camp or workshop.
---
btw if u build few spotligths that mostly trigger the turets.
---
Investigating? Just hit the switch again lol
---
As far as I know it's just the lowest end armor.  I don't believe you can craft it, the only mod I know of is the one from free states, and I have heard that you only can get single effect legendaries (if you've seen otherwise that's interesting). 
---
I would only keep a piece for a short time if it had a slayer's effect since a % damage reduction is typically better than DR/ER, but farming Whitesprings I can usually get a better version pretty quick. 
---
Against enemies, it's sort of unpredictable.  If an enemy never saw you, you're pretty good.  But once they detect your presence, even if it's not in a \[Caution\] state, it's kind of a crapshoot.  Especially for enemies that are fast moving, it's kind of like the latency between becoming cloaked and actually telling the AI that leads to situations where it's like you're not cloaked at all.
---
PS4 and I can get you some caps. How much you want for both?
---
I found them in the shop by Harpers where all the broken display cases are, just south of Wallace. Good luck! 
---
I got Marsupial from the Scorch Beast Queen.
---
I did see one serum recipe at a the Science Wing vendor in the enclave bunker, but it was 19,000 caps.  After 60 more hops of checking that vendor (and the X01 jet pack / calibrated vendor..........was doing runs on both each time)..........I have yet to see that 19,000 cap serum recipe return.
---
Remember the promised New Year's events? Neither do i
---
Thanks bud, but sorry..PC master race. ;)
---
If it's server side they could probaly fix it today, sadly i am pretty sure that isn't going to happen :/ (hope i am wrong)
---
Do what i do, get down in you comfy overstuffed Vault Tec chair and read some of the magazines you have collected through you walks in West Virginia :D 
---
PS4 but thx for responding
---
As far as I can guess, the ultracite variants of any gun should be the next tier of weapons, (not prime recievers). There are also a few weapons that didnt come from fallout 4, but I have only seen a few true ultracite weapons so they should be rare enough to have avoided the duping glitch. I own a 3 star ultracite laser pistol that uses regular fusion cells, which can then have the prime receiver added to it. Creating higher level weapons will inadvertently allow mass duped weapons to lose value. Once the explosive 2 shots are balanced, and other builds will become prevalent again. I use very good explosive 2 shot weapons, but they are too powerful. I am level 97 in survival mode on fo4, and I dont have a weapon on that game that 1 shots anything. Some come close, but the balancing is more fair. 
---
Oh sweet. Hopefully its true and it works because I am pretty pissed I couldnt launch my first nuke when I wanted to yesterday
---
still the best place to play fallout online
---
Had a person walk by me in a cave, didn't see me at all. They were attacked by ants and had to back up pass me again, still didn't see me at all. 
---
Instead of grog 1 Go for US 8, its 25% unarmed damage
---
i agree man honestly  the only thing i want out of this game is rp and i've been tring to find people/discord for it if you find any id really like to join &lt;3
---
Imagine if this was a thing and you could create perk card modes (of cards you own, i.e. you pick all the cards and save the mode like a blueprint on the app). 
---
•Wanna go attack mode? Click the perk mode on the app.
---
•Out of combat and wanna pick up junk? Switch to your Carry Perk mode.
---
•your friend needs help and you wanna play medic? Click medic mode on the app.
---
So many modes you could create and have available at the push of a button, would be very cool. 😀
---
Agree. Same with perk cards. If I have a 5-star perk card, and only 3 of the stat free, I should be able to equip the card, with only 3 out of 5 stars being "on". Without needing to fucking get and make a 3-star copy of the same fucking card I already fucking have maxed. 
---
Same. We were all talking about Anthem yesterday, and a few other titles coming out. A lot of good games coming out soon and no word on more content for 76, so. Might be time.
---
From a community admin on the bethesda forums 2 hours ago:
---
"Hi,
---
We're currently aware of and actively investigating this issue. We're anticipating a hotfix at some point today that will correct it. Once I have the details I'll be sure to follow up. Thanks for reporting!"
---
Really? I thought only ultracite is over there. I was thinking if trade with another player would count.
---
Still currently down for me as well
---
That's actually a pretty good one,never really used any to be honest.  I can make the ultracite laser pistol and some others. Yet the TSE's are too addicting my friend.
---
There is a updated build below
---
Why increase strange more when that will only benefit a meele build.
---
You may have missed this past topic. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a99lvu/just_received_my_nuka_dark_rum_in_the_mail_today/
---
Light combat armour plans spawn in the raider camp at Camden park. If you find heavy armour plans anywhere please let me know PS you may have to sever hop a lot and be patient.
---
I actually find it hit way more often when I aim for the top of the cargo box for whatever reason. Vats really helps, but I also find for long range a .50cal of any kind gets me the most hits and consistent damage, far easier to aim than gatling, and the amm is pretty cheap to make (10 lead per 180 rounds) . Even when I was under lvl 50 I could still kill cargo bots as long as I had a .50 stashed somewhere.
---
If you provide some Quality Content on the Sub you can have all my Updoots.
---
It also benefits his heavy gun build 
---
Pacifist Mode: "Prevents you from engaging in PVP. Other players can still murder you."
---
What the hell is the point of this option? If I don't want to participate in PvP, I should be excluded from it entirely, not turned into a sitting duck.
---
Morgantown and watoga highschool are good for plastic.
---
Grafton highschool and the river raft place on the west River for rubber.
---
Early game i got nuke material from the nuka cola plant.
---
Legendary hunting rifles would also be nice...
---
Just like the planned New Year's event(s)... Right? Oh wait....
---
Lmao
---
The way I see it mounts/vehicles would be a brilliant way to monetize the game with customizations. Is it something I'd expect immediately no, but after a couple of years there's no reason that they can't implement it the changes to the engine to support it. 
---
Frankly I'd be disappointed if they didn't show up. The map is huge. I could see even see events where players have to contribute steel and concrete scrap to make janky Fallout style repairs to bridges. 
---
This look like a lot of fun lol. One tip I have tho is that whisky gives +6 strength with party boy while bourbon gives 3 
---
Oh, that feels bad, when i saw last week "kill 20legendaries with boxing glove or fatman" i was like, what? I can get one of that weapon in week, where do i find those legendaries then. Some challenges are really challenging.
---
Wood armor does have a unique mod from the Free-staters. Never use it, so never tried it. Like the Scorched Killer mods from Firebreathers
---
That's the balance tradeoff though since you don't need a bottle to collect it in this game. Rads are barely an issue in this game anyway.
---
Aaah right
---
-3 Luck when you drink it.
---
In what way apart from carry weight?
---
100 is enough to convince to just buy a jetpack off a player
---
You need 200% health, crafted, and Luck of draw 3 to use any laser weapons. Also, you need to carry at least 3 and high INT for more scrap for repair. I am playing automatic build and I am doing 100% fine. 
---
Your chances of finding one are EXTREMELY low.  I've found 2 shot weapons, I've found explosive weapons, in over 300 hours I've never found one with both.  It seems like it's a 1% chance on any 2 shot OR any explosive, and getting both is like a 0.0000001% chance.
---
Your best bet is to visit FO76 Bazzar and FO76 Market reddits and trade things to get them.
---
You're exaggerating a lot in claiming how much it would break the game. Already you just craft new weapons and armor to keep up as you level. The difference would be that you would use the same (or more) mats to upgrade your old gear rather than crafting it anew. And that doesn't stop anyone from finding appropriate level items instead of upgrading to save mats like we already do.
---
Yep, it's quite lovely, especially for a low-HP build (where you run around at 20% health, the remaining 80% is Rads). This way I can eat whatever I want, and not worry about juggling the Rads.
---
Having said that, I've taken to hot-swapping that card lately. I eat/drink to full, swap out the card, play for however long until hunger/thirst hits red, swap it back in, eat/drink to full, swap it back out. 
---
There is a potential hot fix coming today. 
---

Scroll down a little to see the second or so post from Jurassic one of the community mods. 
---
You can still catch a disease. Be careful to read the specs on what you injest.
---
I see the updated build, that’s what I was going to recommend. Looks good 
---
From a community admin on Bethesda's forums
---
Vault-tec is a real company, Bethesda is their gaming front to gather funds and do initial research for when they finally build vaults to do their true research.
---
Wake up, sheeple!
---
Combine this with rank 3 cannible and you can eat any goul, moleman and supermutant without worry of rads. You'll never go hungry and saves on stimpaks.
---
Honestly I murder things so quickly with lvl 50 weapons and sometimes lvl 35s that I don't feel there is much need to scale up weapons unless they give us better enemies.
---
I'd settle for having wire mesh like the floors.  Giant chicken coops or faraday cages
---
(what did happen to all the chickens? Surprised we don't have giant mutated chickens called cockatrices. Future dlc?)
---
By chance have you tried to over repair them? I'm wondering if their damage is bugged like the ripper (for example). I don't have one myself, or I'd try it.
---
It could at the very least be a read-only app that displays my stats. That is reasonable and doable and ought to be easy. 
---
How is it unfair? Anything someone can have in this game, you can have. If you are taking on someone who is higher in level, they are always going to have more than you. 
---
There will always be players higher level then you. So the disadvantage is always in your head. 
---
Great info!
---
Great I can start playing now just which heavy gunner was not a level 30 perk T_T
---
I found him for the first time yesterday, at Silo Alpha, while I was trying to (unsuccessfully) launch a nuke!  Cool purple colors!
---
Don't Drink the Nukas, they make great Grenades, 600 Damage with Max Perks
---
Only Drink the Cherry Nukas, and make Grenades from the rest.
---
Gotta make sure you're trying to min/max either Melee OR Ranged.  If you're trying to do both, both are going to be poor damage dealers.  Super Mutants are pretty laughably easy to me now at level 150 and I don't even have my full melee build on (as I have to burn points for Pack Rat and other weight reduction crap).
---
I'm fairly certain we found them at a different vendors when we were at lower levels but I honestly dont remember which one exactly. I forgot I even had it in my stash until he reminded me 
---
Unfortunately, the servers can't even allow us to check our own inventories without crashing. There's no search function built in already. There is no way they would be able to handle dozens of sale items listed by thousands of players with the current setup. It's going to be camp based vending machines. People have already found them in datamining and they are going to have all the issues decribed in this thread.
---
Looks good, but you could replace weapon artisan and 3 pts int for 3 pts luck and one gun army. Then you can swap out any int perk and equip artisan  when you repair your guns 
---
By the way that is a low level wrench. I could one shot them if I wanted to.
---
Were you in PA? I saw someone say that makes it not count, and can confirm it myself as of last night (assuming it wasn't something else that went wrong)
---
Not sure I understand your question. Gear and mutations do exactly what they state they do.
---
Now that people are farming the queen regularly, and the world is populated, serum recipies drop and are fairly common. No one buys them, they simply make them. I believe the actual costs in terms of trade value is only 80 caps.
---
Yeah that’d be nice
---
Point proven
---
Yeah but swinging around a 20 pound super Sledge isn't the same as pulling the trigger on a rifle. I wouldn't think it too absurd to have a small stamina tax so you'd have to put a liiittle more thought and strategy into your attacks. The stun lock thing is cool, i did forget about that feature. I wish they'd do it a little more frequently or something, getting jumped by 3 high level yao guai at the same time feels more like an inconvenience than a challenge
---
Awesome I love it! I’ve never used the windmill generators but I like how they look with your place a lot.
---
They had it up for 24 hours only on Dec 8th. I would suggest looking into the Datamines for the Atom shop to see what might be released in the future and plan from there. I thankfully had Datamined the PA paints myself in Beta - [Link](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9trs2g/spoilerdatamine_power_armor_paints/) - so i had been holding onto Atom for its release.
---
I got 2 north of Watoga yesterday evening. 
---
Have you joined the Enclave yet? I love the look of their underarmors.
---
 For stories and ideas like these, check out r/falloutraiders
---
Gotcha. I guess the boundaries of the guy's camp extended into where I was then. And the deathclaw was defending it or whatever. Good to know. 
---
And then you accidentally use a Stempack as you cycle through everything targeted in VATS
---
I’m having a similar issue to the OP, but it’s with wanting to use a double explosive lvl 50 Ultracite laser rifle. There’s only so much I can do to make it last. It only lasts about 2-3 clips, which is a damn shame because I really like that gun ☹️
---
Not a word for 17 hours? I'm not getting my hopes up. I was going to help a buddy launch his first nuke yesterday, then we rescheduled for tonight...
---
It’s probably just chance tbh 
---
I believe this is a regression - the voice toast used to show in first person, no?
---
Do you need a shovel in your inventory to get the treasure?
---
The extra picking perk doesn't work for me on Firecaps...
---
No I purposely got out of my PA and put my hat on because I saw how close I was to leveling :(
---
Depends on SPECIAL.
---
Each point in Strength increases your carry capacity and melee damage. So going from 15 Strength to 30 Strength helps quite a lot. We're talking 300-350 carry capacity when naked, and you hit like a truck.
---
Percaption increases gun accuracy, and you detect enemies from farther away. Charisma reduces vendor prices. Intelligence determines how much durability your crafted items have. Agility increases how much AP you have for VATS and sprint. Luck detemines the condition (and possibly quality?) of the items you loot.
---
They can, it's not exactly a secret that "exclusive availability digital items" get brought back all the time by tons of different studios/publishers...
---
That has happened to me before too! It is so frustrating to do all the work and spend stims and ammo taking down the enemies...for some douche to just sneak in and claim it. 
---
Because people are so eager to parrot bad news about Fallout 76 that even phony rumors take on a life of their own.
---
Impressive....I'll have to post up my last camp and my new one I'm building.   Found a way to build on top of the harpers ferry spawn in train bridge that took hours of moving and planning lol....I'll post it when I'm done.
---
You aren't going crazy, I've noticed this as well.
---
I have a spare TSE handmade you could use, it’ll take it out pretty fast.  I’m not really for ruining the game with one shot weapons, but you are right, the cargo bot is crazy.  Are you on XB1?
---
Remove weapon artisan, you are only going to use it while crafting. Also I highly recommend Gunsmith with heavy weapons, they break super fast without it and you'll find yourself needing to repair after every engagement otherwise. Also Power User over Power Patcher, Power armor breaks slowly as it is, but you'll run thru multiple cores an hour if you don't have it.
---
You'll notice that they are white-ish rather than blue like the forest versions. If you FT to the water park there are at least 5-6 within a couple hundred feet of the spawn point.
---
Get a friend to be the middleman between your characters.
---
1. Farm Sugar Grove.  Plenty of springs there and some good screws too.
---
2. Abandoned Bog Town.  Look for the tallest red brick building, get up to the roof, drop down the elevator shaft, and there's like 15 typewriters and fans there for easy looting (lots of desks and cabinets too).
---
Visit FO76 Bazzar reddit and FO76 Market reddit and trade with other players.  Springs and screws can be reliably gotten there for 3 caps each (going price) and sometimes better.  As a melee player I regularly offload springs and screws in 200+ quantity when I get too many.
---
When has a fallout relied on being this easy? I will admit they are addicting. But one of my biggest pleasure in fallout 4 was attacking the gunners headquarters at level 95+ survival, I died a few times, had to come up with crazy grenade tosses to kill enemies, use multiple weapons and after an hour or so I had the place figured out. Without challenge the game becomes stale. I used to mod my old fallout games to have all of the best stuff, and I would get bored of it almost immediately.
---
Bethesda stated before that they would release a patch somewhere in January.
---
Yes. And all rifles, pistols, and heavy weapons. 
---
This post was made by TSE Shotgun Gang
---
Someone on here said it has no hit detection and goes right through you. Could make an interesting picture though.
---
Thanks for this.
---
But you can't equip 30 worth of Strength cards can you?
---
My level 7 friend who forgot to go to the Overseer’s Camp went back there and got attacked by a guy with the gamertag “NUDE LEG HAIR” (literally, look them up on Xbox if you don’t believe me, their gamertag was exactly that) and he killed us a few times (I’m a level 18 but was only level 16 then) before I finally got him. He kept doing the trade emote as well so I dunno if he wanted to trade.
---
Yao Gui
---
Many springs were gathered that day.  The crafting God's were pleased.
---
Some plans are quest drops IIRC. 
---
I’ll link a spreadsheet later when home.  
---
It's fine to not have one.  I don't talk and haven't felt like I've missed out on anything.
---
Or put on a hazmat suit.
---
Thank you so much!
---
There was no event, and Y2K19 bugged out the nuke silo. 
---
I thought you get the light armor plans by completing main quest. I'm pretty sure that is how I got mine.
---
No, you can't. Because many of those buffs are temporary (from alcohol, radiation, etc.) and the game wouldn't know how to deal with it. On the flipside, if you get a mutation that for example gives you -4 Intelligence, it doesn't turn off your card that requires 5 Intelligence either. 
---
You should fully be expecting NUMEROUS expansions to this game. I wouldn't be surprised if they add in more, since apparently they've expanded all the way to the 1970's for songs now. 
---
I use rank 2 with rank 3 cannibal and bye bye the need for stimpaks
---
Whatever you do don't sell it.
---
What are your gun specs just because I wanna know how people are 2 shotting high level enemies. Thx
---
I've been looking for Targeting HUD forever, and have never seen it there, was starting to think it was only available on lesser power armor models.  
---
I think the VATS range might also be dependent on the range of the weapon. 
---
I just imagine a much closer implementation to what was in fo4.  And... being able to discover what is for sale, where there are vending machines set up, etc.. are just technicalities which could be implemented.  Not that I think it's necessary.  Discovering hidden gems seems more their style.
---
If it's a central hub, it'd be one of two things.  Either there's one bot that holds everyone's stuff, or multiple bots for individual players.  We already have the first option.  You can sell stuff to a vendor at a reduced cost which they will resell for an insane markup.  The second option seems very crowded to me.  I've seen it in games before but wasn't a huge fan.
---
If they let you set up a vendor at your base, mark it on the map with a vendor icon, people will be drawn to your base which would create incentive to hunt down shiny new things to decorate with.  Which are available on the Atom store.  It makes a whole lot of sense to me.
---
I’m level 39 .. sorry if that’s too high GT: BoomPow52
---
Endurance is a pretty useless stat once your 50+.  Do not put many points into it.
---
I think there is a script in this game that makes enemies that have a chance to drop "random ammo" drop ammo for one of your weapons (either equipped or favourited). Mind you, many enemies will still drop their "core ammo" (mole miners dropping shotgun shells or super mutants dropping 5.56mm and so on). 
---
Not add new ones, but redistribute them.
---
Thanks for the downvotes guys, i can't help that Bethesda stated there'd be one and decided to start radio silence straight after it.
---
The General's Steakhouse (1/2 way between RobCo and Camp Venture) has a farm on the north side of the building that has corn, tatos, melons, and I think gourds.
---
Yes. You can decide, after Level 50, moving either 1 special point from one stat to another OR choose a new special card.
---
Nah, it’s cool. Just don’t wanna be playing with people who are too disinterested in the missions for those level ranges.
---
Already can
---
If you are looking to recouperate your losses, on the marker/bazaar you can find the mod for about 3k. That might seem like a lot, but you can make 1400 a days doing vendor runs, taking less than 20 mins. Just FYI
---
Im so glad I logged in that day lol. Literally the only thing I've purchased with atoms thus far besides the grognak outfit. 
---
What would make more sense is if there were something useful you could make with purified water that would have dirty water as a by-product. That would also be more realistic. 
---
Otherwise it's hard to see this ever happening when it's so easy to get a ton of boiled water if you collect dirty water from a stream or lake. 
---
From what I found with stuff in Atom Shop that is also free in the  game, the one you find in game is dirty. The AS version is clean. The greaser jacket is a good example of this.
---
Yes, 1 point can be moved each level instead of choosing a new perk card.
---
I'm not starting again at level 0 every time they pop out a new server type.  That's a 100% no go for me.  If I have to find new loot / weapons / etc in these servers, ok.
---
PVP needs a 100% rebalance and fix before they do this.  My melee character 1 shots people all the time, and I don't even have all the optimal perks equipped.  If there's PVP, it should feel like a FIGHT and need some SKILL, not "swing BOOM dead".
---
Destiny 2 does every one of those things.
---
So, I actually encountered this guy and chatted with him. When my friends and I approached this is how the conversation went... and yes I used his username, he actually told me to take pictures and go ahead and use his name.  
---
Me: Hi, I have one question...  
---
QuantumArtist: hmmm?  
---
Me: ....WHHYYYY?????  
---
QuantumArtist: \*laughs his ass off\*... honestly I'm upset this is a thing that can happen and I've made the most ridiculous base on purpose so that Bethesda gets their shit together and fixes it. It's ridiculously easy to do, please, let me teach it to you so it blows out of proportion and gets fixed sooner.  
---
Then he proceeded to teach us how to do it. Which, if I was listening correctly... is you just place a diner door down and open, then you can actually place a 2nd door down! Then when you log out and come back your camp has DOUBLE blueprints. This is not a player's fault. The next day my camp couldn't be placed and some how I ended up with double blueprints and double items. I \*accidently\* duped my camp and exceeded my camp budget by a lot. Noteworthy though, is that if you do this, you can't use wires because wires don't store but can only be placed if you have budget allowing. So, that's why this guy chose to make a huge statement using the heavy machinegun turrets... we all know how much those things eat up a camp budget!!!!!  
---
Carrying on with the story... so, after he explained to us how it's done and actually asked me to please make posts about it (which I didn't get to doing until now...) I told one of my friends to piss the turrets off so we could see the hell reign down. Here's some photos- it was hilarious and we lagged so damn bad. When my friend ran in circles around this thing it actually almost broke the world we were on!  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/0aVA1T9](https://imgur.com/a/0aVA1T9)  
---
TL;DR- The dude who builds this is nice. He's not trying to be an ass. He's trying to make a point. We talked and learned how to do it and had fun with the turrets, look at the pictures.  
---
I can understand why they don't let you, but it would be awesome given how much flora is in the area.
---
At least you have 17% of a home. Im stuck with the water purifier and a budget of 169%. You are not alone. Ok im living a Hobo life since 12th december patch
---
Id def try taking off green thumb logging off shutting down 76 and then reboot and put it back on cuz it should work
---
So what you’re saying is this game doesn’t appeal to competitive gamers? Because that’s probably accurate.
---
Thing is, there really isn’t much to do in terms of content. All sandbox style games have enough to do to keep you occupied in an honest way; the answer here shouldn’t be “well bro have you even tried finding a random house and having a fake tea party with your friends like get some imagination”. The game just simply lacks content. My group has mains at 180+ and alts at 100+. There’s no more plans to learn, no more story to uncover, workshops are pointless when you A) have everything you need and B) crash constantly. We farm the queen and even that is boring and miserable simply due to the average 8 frames a minute. 
---
This isn’t a “fallout game” either. You’re comparing it to fallout 4 which maybe did have more depth, sure, but try fallout 3 or NV - games we all have over 300-500 hours of play time in and they’re single player. That was possible because their was content, multiple endings, factions and just plain shit to do. Fallout 76 is just a fallout themed, content less game so far where the excuse is “but it’s multiplayer, that’s the content!” Well to that point maybe that’s correct, because now all we do is grief every night and honestly it’s pretty enjoyable. Because what else, literally, is there to do. At least it nets caps and junk, unlike wasting my resources building shit that will just disappear. 
---
Thank you, i saw on norespawns that its a different way of building now and is more architechual and how important roofs are so i changed my build focus to highlight the roofs
---
They will add a total respect serum to buy for caps.
---
I have it on my X-01. Purchased it before I started gathering the data though.
---
Can’t download :( looks neat
---
You have to craft linings for your underarmor to get stat bonuses.
---
Yeah, I meant explosive. 
---
My thought too. Let him put the resources into building it up and fight him for it.
---
8gb of ram is definitely hurting you a bit. You don't state vram on the 580
---
It's not that they were promised, a lot of people reasoned that they were added for the holidays given the "balloons" and "noisemaker" things they had. 
---
How bout you stop trying to dictate how other people should play? 
---
How bout that?

Probably will take them a few hour to index in the app store. I managed to download by clicking on the dev name in the link, and then from that page, it allowed me to download it.

Either of the golf outfits are soooo plentiful in whitesprings and sell for a really good amount considering they only weigh .1 a piece like any other outfit. I usually sell for 25 a piece

I mean why buy apparel when there's no reason to leave PA outside of crafting tables? Also you literally can't even buy any weapon skins right now unless you happen to really like the only 2 melee weapons they have skins for at the moment lmao.
---
ye 
---
A community manager replied to a thread here and stated there was no in-game event, and the tweet was just to encourage players to meet up and be social. They also said the nukes are bugged ATM by something unrelated to New Years and they're rolling out a hot fix soon.
---
Me too. I got it for Christmas and spent all my free time on it.
---
Now that I’m back at work. I’m sad. 
---
On PC, you need a friend. On PS4, you may be able to join your recent server (Social-&gt;Recent-&gt;Player-&gt;Join). Meaning you can take character A, put the gun into a suitcase at a train station, exit to main menu, switch characters, join the same server you just left with character B, go to the same train station and take the item out of the suitcase. It's risky, because if the server crashes, or the player you've been using as the anchor logs off, you'll never find the server again. And if someone sees you place the loot, they can nick it before you come back. But if you don't have any friends stupid enough to play this game, it often better than trusting a complete stranger with your stuff, because Bethesda will do absolutely nothing if they run away with it.
---
I havent really checked, do the higher levels take more/different materials?
---
They said it in inside the vault, or didn't they? I'll check once i get home.
---
Yh its really kl wen u have these little quirks that you dont ever really let ppl know about until somone else says they do it. 
---
I've found a couple. They're pretty rare in my experience
---
I wish there was a mapping perk.  Heck it could be called "surveyor"  Like it would let you turn a layer on/off on the actual in game map to show where plants are.  But only show ones you've walked past.  
---
Ah. That's a shame and awkward i guess. Thanks for sharing!
---
That is too much swing in your performance, you have a problem. Typical drop is from 60 to 45 not 5
---
How bout you don't criticise a good solution to a blatant issue in the first place? Then I wouldn't need to reply.
---
How bout that?
---
Those two points are easily addressed.  Vendor bots can easily be made indestructible.  Along with anything else in a base if they should choose.  Also, a searchable database of vendors could be used to find the item you're looking for.  I've seen it implemented in an MMO from the early 2000's.
---
The upside is that more people will be drawn to your base if you stock good stuff and you can show it off.  Which is an incentive to decorate it.  Which is a selling point in the Atom shop.
---
That would make for a very interesting fissure site, like the mother or all...unless we could hit the Mariana trench with a nuke. 
---
1 month is a decent time for me (even if it sounds stupid) and met him in the beta. always hit off very well, until now.
---
I thought those were craftable?
---
This, what people fail to see is we are all exploiting by server hoping.  The game design is that this stuff is super rare and takes you hundreds of days to aquire.
---
my GT is: vorkot3
---
i got 2x ivory grip from one map,  talk about jackpot!
---
You also kinda get used to how far off it is.
---
&gt; single shocks or targeting module for X01
---
Better be prepared to dedicate literally half a day to server hopping if you wanna see a single X01 shocks lmao. 
---
Damn you Todd Howard!
---
What did you program the app with my good sir, fellow dev here 
---
I think the plus sign next to the name when you pick it up means it is a pre-modded weapon, not 100% sure though. The +, ++, +++, next to stats when viewing the details are the relative levels compared to what you have equipped.
---
nope
---
Like the gatherer addon for world of warcraft
---
Looks good. Do you plan to do anymore with it? 
---
The robot talking is the best part HAHA
---
It can be just the players listed on the server.  It doesn't need to be the entire fallout universe.
---
They can make it smart, functional, and easy to use in a central location and people will use them constantly.........or they can make it camp based and have all the drawbacks and eventually nobody will use them.
---
So you found x01 parts outside the bunker and managed to not scrap them for all that time?
---
Possibly one of the biggest pain points with this game right now.  Server stability still tops the list.
---
The entire UI while in power armour is outright awful, an entire overhaul would be great.
---
No shovel needed 
---
Ive got one each of the standard ones was starting getting a Lvl 45 set of raider it but decided i wanted the 10lbs of stash space instead. I think i may need to pair down my Gears, Screws, and Springs though i dont think i really need 600 of each of them. Been crafting weapons armor to scrap for mods when i can but since i only hold onto 50 of any non rare material (except wood and steel) i tend to run out of those fairly quickly.
---
Also not sure if it's true since the guide has a lot of other mistakes, but the guide says that equipping that eye of ra item doubles the effectiveness of those legendaries.
---
Bethesda is gonna have to reward millions of atoms when they finally fix all those
---
There is a lot more potential in pacifist griefing than being hostile, I would like if they fix that
---
Examples:
---
-running in front of people with explosive weapons to make them blow themselves up
---
-not letting people loot by constantly staying in front of them
---
-in group pvp, one person drops from team and goes into pacifist mode, then just runs around quasi invincible to find enemy positions and stand in front of them to tank all of their hits while their team attacks them
---
-threaten people and grief them into attacking you, then just wait until they get over it and start walking away, then start unloading into their back
---
And a lot more
---
Imo if you shoot someone 20 times then they should be hostile, regardless of pacifist mode. The only time you can shoot someone 20 times without them running/fast traveling away is if they are pacifist griefing you
---
Sheesh...
---
Serum recipes drop from the Queen, and now that the game has been out she has been farmed a lot where the recipes are fairly common. Players are selling them for 500 per usually. Making 1400 caps a day from vendors, gets you the 5/6 serums you want in about 2 days. I dont know many builds that use more than that.
---
Not only that but they also need to crack down on those sites selling caps for real money. I was watching some random random video and the dude was advertizing for one of them in the intro…
---
If Nothing happens everything players will sell will be at horrendous prices due to the artificial inflation caused by the illegitimate amount of caps in circulation. 
---
Which lets be real, these websites are likely making mules duping non stop and selling shit to vendors and whatnot to fund their stocks.
---
**These characters and most importantly, the idiots who are buying the caps need to be permabanned**
---
I only played WOW for like 2 weeks then I stopped.  So I don't know.  But sure. :D 
---
Sorry but software that has dozens of millions of dollars to spend on marketing don't get a pass on this kind of BASIC SHIT.  Your whole argument is pointless.
---
I went in at level 33 and felt satisfied with myself for completing it with only 5 deaths. Now I can't try to break my record..
---
Do you have any screenshots?
---
I actually dont have that perk. What's it called?
---
wait
---
Realistically you can still gain about 20 levels from 5h of farming whisperings :) farm more than enough to change your build around to give the 50 cal some bite :) don’t spend 9 points on the heavy gunner perk.. just go 3, after that there’s only a small number that you will need to get your hands on.. don’t bother with the faster reload perk if you are a speed deamon. But defo invest in the perk that gets melee wepons to swing faster... for some reason when my bud uses his Gatling gun with and without the perk it heavily ramps up the Dps.. I don’t know if it’s just gatlin.. fingers crossed the same works for you in your new heavy build :)
---
ok
---
Yeah... Except when it doesn't work the way it should. My DR/ER *out* of per armor are both 300+, according to status in my pipboy, and have perks like blocker on top of that. On paper, I should be tanky as hell. In practice, it seems like I go down way faster and more often than the people around me. Was doing the event down at fort defiance last night, and had 4 scorchbeasts flying around. Every time is respawn or get revived, i'd be down again like 3-4 seconds later.
---
Chief save the negotiations for when the market opens
---
Rose is impressed. Unique dialogue. 
---
they literally just said theyre adding camp vendors, are you being sarcastic?
---
It's best to have 3 guns that you specialize in that have fairly common or easy to craft ammo.
---
For me that's been the Handmade 5.56, Combat Rifle .45, and Gauss Rifle 2mm.  Rotate what gun you use on certain types of enemies.  For lower level areas you might want to throw a Pipe Gun .38 into that mix (or a Combat Rifle with a .38 mod).  That will spread your ammo consumption so it doesn't go down too fast on one ammo type.
---
Also make sure you're using Ammosmith and Super Duper when crafting ammo, you'll get a LOT more ammo.
---
Yea I have a 16gb on the way though! :)  
---
But the vram on 580 is 4gb, which is the recommended for 1080p. 
---
Honestly you just need an interconnected auction house.  The auction house can be anywhere on the map, and going to it would connect you to a global auction list.  I'd rather have this then a vending machine at my camp.  
---
That is a training vault, not a vault actually used for folks sheltering from the bombs, though why the people at VTU did not use it for that I am not sure.
---
More of the same materials.
---
Not yet, i can grab some next session of the front and interior.  Won't be revealing location for obvious reasons lol
---
I just started an alt. I have 0 perks for melee and i use melee to kill nearly everything.
---
Damage is wonky.
---
This is exactly what I do for mine, too.  Paint at least one piece on set with an Atomic Shop paint and then you can tell which one that is at least.
---
Yea its on the hdd, I need to look into SSD probably huh?
---
All night long doesn’t do what you think it does. Try dromedary and slow metabolizer instead 
---
Currently working on a trading post/disco hall/apartment building/rooftop park (AstroTurf) but it’s much much smaller in size. Only five floors and it’s got major clipping issues from the location, but it’s got a built in washer/dryer/kitchen with running water and so much random spawning junk that it puts extractors to shame
---
Huh?  
---
I'm sure they already got the cost it took to make at $18 a pop. 
---
You may have better luck on r/fo76bazaar
---
It heals you but only up to your radiation bar.  If you keep adding radiation your max health keeps going down.
---
Very true, very true. I'm a glutton for punishment and diiid switch from bloodborne to this game, so maybe I'm just being a bit biased 😁
---
Well, if anyone else would find it useful, I would definitely add any additions, that would benefit our games :) 
---
No, I want another way of trading (via terminals). That would save me time.
---
Gatherer addon would take everyones gathers (that uses the addon) within the guild and logs them onto ur map so thats things like mining, plants, fishing all that and would show how much has been gathered at every point that has been gathered since u got the addon
---
Damn it, I knew it was too good to be true...
---
Can't judge, some of my codes here at work also got dicked by new year haha
---
No such thing as the trade-steal bug, don't worry. Sorry some made up rumor scared you away from trading and grouping. This game is actually pretty friendly, have fun out in the wastes
---
crack addicts wish they looked so fancy
---
Probably best to have a few viable weapons on you so you have a backup.
---
XCode/Swift, Realm as a database solution. 
---
give me body tats or give me death
---
If you are in X box I have a spare chest plan. No charge just good will. 
---
I took it as they hadn't experienced any pvp in game and wanted to share the thrill that it can be.  I know that's what happened for me. At first I had no desire for pvp. But after my first encounter, i discovered it can be a really fun. 
---
Neat! 
---
And yes, having mining veins also would be good.  
---
You should add in a Mod and Plan checklist so you can check them off as you unlock or learn them from plans. Any plans for Android?
---
I agree.  I get legendary pieces that would be nice if I could turn them from light into heavy.  Even if this took the recipe or a perk card I'd be down for it.
---
Yes it just negates some of the effects of being starved or dehydrated it doesn’t actually effect the rate at which the bar decrease 
---
It is a stash locker.
---
It is the white laboratory looking locker. 
---
The one I was looking for at least.
---
It is in fact the Locker Plan in Watoga. 
---
Wendigo caves has several Wendogo and they always have at least 5 screws. Portable fuel tanks have screws and Noone ever seems to notice. Me? I just buys screws off the marketplace for 4 caps a piece . I use them by the hundred so it is far faster.
---
Wait till you drop that for cavivor 
---
Hot damn that's a good tip!
---
Trade for some.
---
Are you actually that much bigger than her IRL?
---
I have seen maps with deposits but no veins
---
I see so you're saying they closed the ticket before 96 hours?  Can't really tell any more since you deleted the post.  If so, that's kind of a crappy policy.
---
Son of a bitch lol, thank you!
---
Memory too. You ran out of memory, and it tried using the hdd. A ssd is a huge upgrade as well, but probably memory first. Also make sure you close everything you can, even the launcher for now.
---
Not sure what's 'raider' about any of this, but at least you're having fun.
---
The first rule is you don't talk about the Fallout Fight Club.
---
What's the common denominator with all your disconnects?
---
play at work then. be the change you want to see
---
High level super mutants and scorched are good for 5.56 ammo.
---
I mean, you can just buy one on r/market76
---
What non-anecdotal evidence is there that they are rapidly  losing players?
---
Grahms pretty cool too but I haven't seen him for like a month,  hope he's doing well.  😭
---
It doesn't matter. They clearly meant well. When you grow up you'll realize that behaving like this is embarrassing and sad. Everything isn't some kind of attack against you. 
---
I see what you did there.  
---
&gt; So duping makes it even less enjoyable for people that actually want to play a trader
---
Maybe if you're someone that does nothing but grind legendary drop spots so you could sell TSE's drfor 20k a pop before dupers caused the prices to drop. For anyone looking to actually buy weapons it can only be said to benefit them.
---
I TINK GREEN LUCKY CLOVER DUDE
---
Not my concept of "having fun" in a game. I go there once per day, too much work for a shop locked between 2 loading screens and a moderate amount of running.
---
That is actually a really nice thing to add. Might be useless if Bethesda will finally add this into the game itself thou :)
---
My prediction is they will fix it. Along with dozens of other gameplay oversights that we just had to put up with in Fallout 4 or hope it can be addressed by mods. 
---
In some ways this is a better Bethesda than we’ve ever had before. 
---
Nope.
---
Also, fix the VATS bug that can make you useless and crash your game if you go into your Pip Boy while the bug is active... That's really really annoying.
---
How do you play and film your monitor with your phone at the same time?
---
Some people met new peeps. Most ppl showed up alone.
---
Nah, not at first. I did that for my first char to figure out what I enjoyed, then char #2 I planned and even that sorta changed. 
---
Now I bank all my levels mostly until a friend needs a certain rank of card shared
---
For Toxic Valley #03, it showed up for me when I was treasure hunting last week. But it did not use up my map. I still have it, and when I was treasure hunting I could dig the mound like 5 times with 1 map before it just stopped working. I reported that as well.
---
Do they have one of these with a location for plans/ Schematics?
---
Yes!
---
In ESO, you could ask Zenimax support to sell something to you if it passed.  Does FO76 even have a support group?  Could ask them.
---
Awww...
---
And he was such a good boi, too.
---
Yeah that's about my position.  Any build that doesn't 1-shot isn't really viable.  Now.. pvp builds designed to avoid being 1-shot?  That i'd be interested in.
---
I saw the plan at Lewisburg Station last night so I'm sure you should be able to find it there by server hopping.
---
Lol, are you...answering your own question?
---
It's a great perk I admit. However I may land up swapping it for something else as I find I'm mostly eating cooked food and purified water these days. It would be no real hassle to swap back if required. 
---
I'm still praying they bring over Atom's Judgement
---
&gt;they literally just said theyre adding camp vendors
---
Explain?  First I've heard of this...
---
Tbh, not sure yet. I am developing mostly for iOS right now. But sure, I might do it if others will find it useful :)
---
Skyrim too s'il vous plaît
---
you did ? strange, never been to a more empty fissure site :/
---
also read that somone notice that the fissures look like they were kinda closed up..
---
Will do a new run tonight, i start at the glass caverns and run through the others back to watoga...
---
Unless you invested lots of recipes and plans on that character, you are better off making a new one and having a friend transfer everything over. The respec in this game is trash. 
---
My friends call me Tri-pod    
---
But seriously: my wife filmed while I built
---
They fixed it. Ones barn door one is barn building.  1 is advanced power connectors 
---
Its a bit of a bummer. I leveled my 1st character well past level 100 and never saw much pvp at all. Mostly accidental wanted and waiting for someone to claim my bounty.
---
Now on my alt the only pvp interactions are griefers and they are 1 sided to say the least. They follow you around, try to find your base then flag and wipe it out with no wanted bounty.
---
Just shit ppl being shits.
---
OP, what do you mean "public" camps?  They're all public now.  You mean not taking damage from every troll player that wanders by?  I'm up for that.
---
Dumb Question but what does TSE stand for?
---
Nah, give it some more time. No point in limited time paints if they do it that frequently
---
They need to just release more and better Atom Shop items
---
So first off, don't use a shotgun on flying things.
---
You need to shoot the Cargobot's four engines - the quest actually tells you this! The engines have very low HP and take 1-2 shots each. If your aim is bad then use VATS and the Concentrated Fire perk. Each engine you cripple makes it slower and lower - the quest tells you this too! Once all four engines are crippled it falls out of the sky.
---
I can shoot people with an explosive shotgun and it will deal very little damage until they shoot me back. Are you sure you have pacifist mode on? I'm specc'd into shotguns/explosives, one shot scorchbeasts on the ground
---
Wow, lame! I don't understand why quick hot-fixes are not a thing. I don't understand the computers, but on the spot fixes for glaring, game breaking issues are pretty standard for these type of games.
---
I had that happen too a few times.
---
It wasn't bugged out though. There just is no map marker for the robot you have to talk to.
---
So just search for him around the event area. I use VATS to help with it.
---
Nope. You need an original blade of Bastet to craft a levelled up version; you can’t make one afresh. 
---
You could make an argument for overrides that are one way and refresh the cooldown. That said that opens up the chances for abuse. 
---
Agreed. They should just release more limited time items
---
Oh haha i got u
---
That’s dangerous. lol 
---
Lv 200 something, flew by the seat of my pants and never bothered respeccing after they put in.  It just worked... There isn't any content in this game which requires min/maxing and I doubt there ever been will be.
---
I gave it 5 stars man neat idea 
---
Looks so good but it's such a shame that a simple recolor costs around $20. 😱😭
---
They have a fix on the way [https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/6Gmr5HkkEgOY2k8qyey4M8/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-december-19-2018](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/6Gmr5HkkEgOY2k8qyey4M8/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-december-19-2018)
---
Sounds about right.  I've checked the vendor 100+ times and only seen the Stealth Boy and Jet Pack once.
---
Would still be useful for weapon mods, see if you have unlocked all the ones you can get from scrapping. Was going to print off a excel with them but would have been like 20 pages.
---
Thanks I've got  green thumb I'll try that, I've also got. Loads of scrap so I'm going to start selling it off as well.
---
Yep. But after doing the event for several times already, the waiting time for his monologue to end is annoying :(
---
If all this is happening to you, you should be complaining too. It's fucking unacceptable. 
---
My votes is for grahm or the vendor bots specifically the raider bots and the harper ferry vendor Wallace. Live free or DIE!
---
F4 attacks are resolved by a simple and stupid formula that bases defence stength on your settlement defence number, and attack strength based on stuff stored in the workshop. Both are capped pretty low, and tend to max out, yeilding a success rate for the player of 51%. Walls, defensive configuration, and settler equipment, are of no consequence whatsoever. If you're there, the attack just plays out, or if you buy the settlement defense pack you can build cameras and monitor the fight from another settlement.
---
yeah, she is one crazy robo chick :D
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019
---
I'm unsure. There is r/fo76bazaar but that place is shit.
---
Yeah I'm nervous about UI mods in general. All I have is Better Inventory since I can't see that inventory management really gives an advantage. 
---
Things like highlighting corpses or plans seems like cheating. 
---
They are getting better with some of the prices, but they need to overhaul them all. 
---
We chatted last night. Had a big party. He still loves meat
---
Have you tried a lever action? I recall using those around that level.
---
I haven't figured out what those do either. They might just be stuff left in from Fallout 4.
---
Thank you for bringing this up. Recently, I noticed a couple of 'normal' legendary mobs dropping some 2 stars weapons. I had no idea why nor did I care. Now that I know.
---
Rose is awesome. Her quest line was the only one I was able to stay focused on without being distracted by a misc quest or event etc
---
I don't criticize good solutions. 
---
Wow. What's an example of this three way?
---
can't tell you the last time I died to anything other than my own fire LOL! Having a TSE Gauss Rifle that puts out 900 dmg is pretty much insta death to me if anything is remotely close to my face LOL! I've gotten a lot better about it tho. I switch to my Instigating Hammer or my Furious Grog Axe much more often now. 
---
Or keep a spreadsheet. Unfortunately if you didn't start one from the get-go, just figuring out what you already know will be a chore. 
---
They can't make bases indestructible for a couple of reasons.
---
1. Veteran players will use bases to create traps for newbies in low level areas.  Drop your base on a spawn location and wait for confused new players to get stuck in them.  They're not smart enough at that point to fast travel, and may not understand logging out will put them in a new world.
---
2. Veteran players can also use this to create indestructible mobile PVP / PVE platforms.  Think you have crashing problems in nuke zones now?  Wait till 8 players drop bases loaded with turrets on the scorch beast queen.  All those rockets going off will crash the server for sure.
---
And after seeing enough pipe pistols, spoiled food, and .38 ammo, I'm going to stop visiting those camp vendors.  Not worth my time to even check.  Fast travel, loading screens, walking to the base, hoping I don't spawn INSIDE the base and get stuck, blech, no thanks.
---
If they're all in a centralized location, now it doesn't take me hardly any time to check 10 terminals to look at 10 different players stock.  I'll check out your wares at least a couple of times per day.  Maybe even server hop to see what 10-20 hops worth of vendor items looks like occasionally.
---
I was hoping for a discord but thanks tho
---
I'm not sure if it's double. But buffs the effects of all the Mistress' items. 
---
Fiberglass and crystal or my go to sellers, silver and gold can also work.
---
I do yeah. I was minding my own business, level 27, at that point. And some a-hole, with an explosive gun some in, and I guess shot me in the face with high perception, because I died in like 3 shots.  
---
Nice!
---
Please. I want the Grafton mayor in the enclave as the new US president
---
Chally the super sonic moo moo.scared the crap outa me first time she came rockiting past.
---
well your on reddit at work already so...
---
SBQ fight and you need to find what's shooting at you amidst the murk?
---
Nah. Here's Sam! She's been fighting next to you then minutes now and it's not like you can lose track of her minigun fire! Forget finding the tiny dog in the grass eating your feet. 
---
Ohh I believe it. I mean granted the TSE is a legendary perk, so I kinda sorta get it being a little OP, but I have a plain Jane fire axe that tears through enemies 30 levels higher than me like wet paper. 
---
On x box I simply message them
---
Ah. That would be why then. I spent so much time walling in every settlement, then having the only entrance heavily fortified with turrets/traps. Every settler had raider armor equipped with some sort of weapon (better than a pipe gun). Apparently it was all just for looks. 
---
howd you get it so big, that camp duplication glitch?
---
This is no different from a mod that is currently available on nexusmods. 
---
Is there a list anywhere of said rare plans from these rare vendors that we should be keeping an eye out for? In case we just happen to run across the super rare things we know to snatch them up
---
Idk I'm not a game Dev but this is what they wanted to try 
---
Totally agree, im lvl 91, and dropped it for Rejuventaed, because i have tpns of rwdaway, but in early it is extremley usefull. Also try to combine it with cannibalism perk, very good synergy.
---
I've seen them at the BoS vendor in Watoga.
---
I would paint it for you, but I cant trade painted pieces and if I drop them they self-destruct.
---
&gt;Scorched Beast
---
I moved south west to the skinny dipper pond, logged in last night to a scorch beast blasting my water purifiers. 
---
I bought scorched ashes once. I'm still happy with that.
---
Okay cool, yea I have some 16gb sticks coming in the mail soon. Hopefully that helps.  
---
I'll look into getting some SSD soon as well.
---
Yup. Farming the asylum for straight jackets is a good way to empty vendor cap stashes. 
---
Ty for the reply. I remeber seeing someone joke back in Nov on the sub they just covered the bench with standard Stashboxes since they are indestructible(?). 
---
Dead is dead stops at the elevator, even with grenade spam my guy is sure to croak lots on the assaultrons ;)
---
It's amusing how easy it now seems at lofty level 15 with Watoga handmade plans and raider PA. Try it !
---
So, gonna sh
---
yeah this isn't even close to whats being commented on 
---
Dupers do it on purpose what your talking is the camp accidental bug which has nothing to do with this conversation were talking about people who are using bugs to create weapons and armor not 29 tato plants  
---
this is true as well... I have an Instigating Super Sledge and 1 power attack from it is murder to just about anyone and I only have 1 pip in each of the Slugger perks so only 30% dmg boost vs the 60% it could be. 
---
Added yah 
---
I know you can exit VATS quickly, but in practice I never can and wind up being dragged in a circle on the spot while being pummeled by stuff. It's rarely harmful, but it's incredibly annoying. 
---
Theres a small patch near wendigo cave go south bout 30 feet mayb and look at the cliffs theres a small shack with 3 carrot plants
---
Make sure you're crafting your own weapons.  If you have the plans, most of them scale up to whatever level you are.
---
Also try to do events and find plans at the vendors for better guns / mods.   My end-game ranged build uses the handmade, combat rifle, and gauss........and can reasonably solo anything but a scorched queen.
---
FYI: Toxic water is different from toxic goo, I see some comments getting them mixed up.
---
Toxic water: Rads and gets you sick
---
Toxic goo: A lot of rads
---
I feel like they really fail to advertise a lot of stuff on the shop... and when they do advertise it, they do it in a really annoying way. The Blackbird paint is one where I felt like I almost missed it, at a time when I was playing 5+ hrs a day.
---
I heard about it while I was scrolling through this sub during a poop sesh.
---
Rose is voiced by [Alex Cazares](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7858309/). People have also mistaken her for Sarah Silverman, Ashleigh Ball (Rainbow Dash), and Karen Carbone (Moira Brown in FO3).
---
It's weird because if you had them in a stack before, they stayed that way. But as soon as you move them they unstack. 
---
I've played every day since the beta. I try to check the atom shop as often as possible yet i still somehow managed to miss it. Now i'm sitting at over 4k atoms waiting for it to come back. 
---
well it would give a nice supply of water anywhere and be useful for non traditional base designs 
---
I forgot about Wallace! What a champ haha. Definitely the highlight of my daily vendor route. 
---
I’m guessing that is due to you having too many duper weapons judging from your post history....
---
Oh, right, just double checked and it says, 
---
"Voice of Set - Obtained as a reward for completing Mistress of Mystery Quest: Prototypical Problems. Does additional damage and has a chance to stun robots when wearing the Eye of Ra."
---
"Blade of Bastet - Obtained as a reward for completing Mistress of Mystery Quest: Forging a Legend. Armor penetration increased when wearing the Eye of Ra."
---
So it's not doubles, but one gains an additional effect and they both just get stronger.
---
I mean, they do 1/2 to 1/3rd the dps of other weapon types. And it gets worse for utility, since it has massive agility perk bloat.
---
But other than that if you want to roleplay I guess they are good.
---
Yes I know buying is an option, but I wanted to know the best place to farm
---
I 1 shot stuff with all sorts of guns. Sneak plus headshot plus over 200 damage weapons equals frequent 1-shots. With my 2 shot bpr I kill all sorts of crapwith headshots even when not sneaking.
---
They can be. Just never for long. They seem to have the durability of wet paper. 
---
 It's hardware town 2.0 "hey! My friend is hurt" becomes "hey, my camps up the way, and you're probably over encumbered and looking for a place to scrap and resupply, follow me!" I foolishly scrapped my allotted plot mission apparel to make it look extra legit, but usually just flashing the follow me and lets camp emotes they get the drift. They walk up and are usually impressed, fusion generator, keypad doors, a good 1/3 flat didn't realize the 4 numbers beside the pad were the number. I say so on Mike and they open up, get locked in and now have 4 options while over encumbered. 
---
1. Drop enough weight to escape by fast travel 
---
2. Pay the toll of 5 chems 
---
3. Shoot their way out and become wanted 
---
4. Server hop. 
---
Dude. Love this concept, that’s great. Going to get it and rate it right now. Well done, and thanks from the community. Keep it up. 
---
awful, amateur game design.   embarrassing.
---
[There are some under Misc that weigh 0.1 and seem to have no use.](https://i.imgur.com/jMv02B6.jpg) (Maybe I haven't found the quest, idk.)
---
What's the NPC with the crown mean?
---
especially since the majority of the names on the CAMP plans mean fuck all when trying to figure out what you actually have.
---
**Plan: High tech Table**
---
As far as I can tell, that's a round wooden fucking coffee table!
---
I think he means to place them as map markers like with like your friends camps. 
---
Some function to set camps as public or private, show up on the map or not. 
---
It's ok, but 1/3 of the people in FO76 Market.
---
I also wish they had a Karma system like FO76 Market.  I'm a veteran trader and no I won't do a super risky trade by dropping first to a person I have no idea if they have 0 trades or 200 successful trades.
---
I met a wife and husband duo on fallout and honestly that relationship is great man congrats
---
The economy in this game isn't a focus. They need to just fix duping finally. Now dupers break servers in order to dupe. People have been duping since the games release though.
---
I don't think they care.  At all.
---
Honestly was surprised new songs didn't have a category in the atom shop.
---
And how does it work, do you have any trouble with any enemies?
---
My friends lied to me 😭 Im about to throw hands. 
---
*always fact check my friends*
---
Wallace&gt;Phoenix 
---
Somebody change my mind.
---
If you’re on Xbox I have a nearly complete t-51b and t-60 (both are missing one piece).
---
Local chat definitely works. I think most people would still rather play Fallout as a solo game. I know I keep my mic nearby and only hook it up if someone is frantically emoting at me. But, on the occassion I have the mic hooked up, I do get random people talking to me. Honestly I'd rather not listen to the complete jerks that are douchebags for no reason, so I like to know someone's cool before I have to talk to them. 
---
pvp is really fun especially in groups like 4v4 or 4v4+4 (a team of 8 divided into 2 teams working together)
---
it is a much better endgame than infinitely farming whitesprings
---
My guess is that AI have their own usable inventory which is supposed to be replaced when you loot them. Sometimes you can see the swap happen (like when a Super Mutant's grenade inventory is visible briefly and is replaced with their loot drops).
---
You must have somehow looted it before the loot swap happened. But the player has no means of using it. /Shrug
---
I think you just need a bit of imagination.  Sounds like you could build a base to "trap" someone and force them to become wanted because they would instinctively just shoot their way out.  That sounds like an existing problem, not a problem that would be introduced by vendor bots in camps.
---
Also.. tons of turrets on the schorchbeast queen is also already a problem.  And NPC damage VS Player damage is an important distinction here.  That could also be easily addressed.
---
It's all technicalities that could be addressed.
---
Why use lot word when few words do trick? 
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Their crap mechanic of getting plans and mods drives much of the duplication exploiting. I would rather be exploring the game not server hopping for plans and mods. So, rather than spending wasted time logging in and out of worlds, people would rather trade caps with a duper. Again, I still believe this is all part of Bethesda’s long game. Throttle items and sell them for Atoms later. Unfortunately for them, the duplication glitch likely undermined their plans. 
---
Id run green thumb and one of the Luck Critical cards and use overdrive
---
My first character i flew by the seat of my pants
---
 second character I planned but that changed and then I revamped my first character cuz that was a shorter path 
---
I'm still learning about how perk cards affect things what they do work with and what they don't you're never going to stop learning you just get a little better
---
I'm finally at a point where I can look at pretty much any build and kind of see where they're going and maybe have some advice after 200 levels
---
My advice for anyone just starting out stick the strength stick to melee unless you really want to shoot weapons and fire guns and getting all that melee safe strength is safe that's a good good way to experience the game for the first time
---
When you figure out everything and you can think of what kind of Bill you want do you want to stealth rifle build do you want to shoot rocket launchers that auto Target on everything do you want to be a little V Zippy dude with high resistant low health and walk around and smash everything would have one hand claw
---
You know then you can start focusing on specific builds which require specific gear and may or may not work out well
---
I actually created a second character just so I could get the achievement. That would have bothered me too much. 
---
Is each of the enclaves vendors inventory different? If so son of a b****...
---
Way easier to hide and less of a time sink.
---
Caught parked and fucking with my phone. Oh the wife had an issue.
---
Caught parked and playing fallout is a bit harder to cover up lol.
---
There is a discord for it, but I think they rebranded it. I ended up leaving it, so I cannot invite.
---
I would love it if there were automated VendorTrons that functioned as auction terminals (like the lonesome road DLC) at every NPC vendor in the game. You deposit your items, name your price, and anyone at ANY VendorTron in that server can buy em.
---
The problem with CAMP vendors is.........the first 3 I go to are going to be filled with pipe pistols, .38 ammo, and rotten food. After that I'm not going to bother visiting to see what garbage you don't want.....lol  But if we had the automated VendorTrons at all the NPC vendors, I would visit it EVERY time I was at a NPC Vendor.
---
I've used the trading reddit a lot.  And it's time consuming and frustrating at best.  Half the time people post and then never check their post again.
---
Yes. As I said. That's an excellent idea.
---
I wish i had started this from the beginning, but i just write them down as i buy them. Since i didnt start doing this till later, i still rebuy plans i already have every now and then . There are a couple of gdrive checklists out there that might be more helpful. 
---
They were already spawned and fighting super mutants when I found them near dropsite 63. Hope that helps. 
---
Ghouls and anglers drop adhesive frequently.  Also check industrial locations like Grafton Steelyard (more tool boxes and wall tool hangers there).
---
Cells are loading screens, yeah. I think it's because it's still using 4's engine where if you're outside rain gets on your face. It's just like that in Fallout 4 too if the building's interior is still part of the main area of the Commonwealth
---
I have purchased se real items, one on accident, but have been pretty satisfied overall. I picked up the Combat armor camouflage paint, the Blackbird paint job for PA, and the red rocket sign on accident.   I am pretty happy with the all
---
On a side note bought all these with atoms earned in game, and have somewhere around 1500
---
More. 
---
Thanks for this. Crazy that it is necessary. Clearly from the art design these stairs should just snap to each other without tricks, but they normally don’t.
---
Buh dum chh...
---
Do you feel like the atoms that they give you and reward you with are money? Because I would only feel that way about the atoms you bought with money, since those tuxedos were bought with the free points, they weren't 8 dollars. You can't buy food with atom shop points
---
Take note of the vendor factions on the linked map as each faction has the same caps pool. 
---
To assist with cheaper fast travel, make use of the Travel Agent perk in CHA for 1 point. To maximize savings make sure to share that perk card with your team and use places like your camp, teammates or their camps, vault 76 and claimed workshops to cut your paid travel distance if possible. Weigh the time of the loading screen vs caps saved to decide if this is best for your travel plans. I'll often use a free travel past where I want to go if the free travel spot is a bit closer than my current position and walk the rest of the way. Build camp in a central location to your preferred vendors so if you find yourself needing to visit more than one a day that it's about the same cost whichever way you go.
---
Make more caps off your items by using the Hard Bargain perk in CHA for 1-3 points. Using Berry Mentats, alchohol or other CHA boosting consumables to increase your profits as well without dropping any points in CHA.
---
Monster Mash? elaborate plz 
---
Good luck!  There are still robot NPCs, but most of the story comes from terminals and holotapes.  I'm not really sure how I feel about it yet, but sometimes it's better than reading through lots of dialog prompts.
---
I went in with low expectations and have been pleasantly surprised so far at least.
---
Look, honestly, I have nothing against the PvP aspect of the game as it is. Just like I don't have anything against Cage Fighting. But I'd just like there to be an option to not engage in it whatsoever - completely take yourself out of the equation. Just like I don't hop into an octagon if I DON'T want to get punched in the face and beaten to a pulp.
---
I get it that some people want to do this. That's cool. I've engaged in PvP for trophies and whatnot. But when I've tried, if people don't respond to it, give me a thumbs up, or just do nothing, I give them a thumbs up, and walk away. And I make sure not to bother them again.
---
I think Bethesda is (and did initially when they made the game) putting A WHOLE LOT OF FAITH in players, and TRUSTING THEM TO DO THE RIGHT THING. .....but look at what happened to Nukes......FIRST DAY.....just to troll players, they launch 3 at a time, and crash the servers. 
---
I'd just like the option. That's all. To stay out of the fight completely.
---
I served in the military. I CHOSE, for all those years, to BE IN the fight. But now that I'm retired, I'm choosing to stay OUT OF IT. 
---
I'd just like the actual choice to be left alone while enjoying my Fallout experience. I don't think that's an irrational or unreasonable request.
---
Ohhhhh, look at Mr. Plastic Bags over here with all his spare plastic. Some of us have a shotgun we have to feed.
---
Patience, wiring pre-blueprinted is a must, and a lot lot lot lot lot of scrapping floors and walls and other things if you have to start over from scratch.
---
It’s actually a ton of work 
---
I have wanted a miltiplayer Fallout since I started playing Fallout 3. I always thought it would be so fun to explore the wasteland with a friend, and it is! 
---
This is something that needs to be ingame regardless
---
Dude if a mother fucker wants to be left alone and not killed and not engage in pvp - then fucking allow it. Fuck it's simple as that. You are one of those mother fuckers who think "no means yes" I bet.
---
I’m a level 76 but I love helping out lower levels and I’ll be interested in helping with the missions if u want
---
I could get on board with this.
---
True. There’s still a market for ingame currency for any game :( 
---
I do believe that it would lessen their amount though.
---
Opposite. Accessed in the Map -&gt; Z -&gt; Menu. Not accessible from out of game. 
---
As another commenter said, I also had it where I used the Toxic Valley Map 03 fine for the first time, but it didn't consume the map - every other mound did consume it. 
---
Yeah sounds like it.  They're probably having a rough time in their CS department given everything that's going on =/
---
100% yes. Been waiting for something cool for awhile. NCR ranger gear, stealth suits, some more dusters, maybe even combat armor sets? That way we can have a cohesive look without surrendering functionality 
---
I started using a Tesla Rifle for this very reason.
---
True. I will need to find a complete list of those, and then will be able to add it. Very nice idea.
---
Am I a horrible person for one shotting them as soon as they speak? Probably. I always assume robots in the woods are hostile haha. *Free steel tho right?*
---
In an ideal world, I would swap to heavy/auto/melee build.  Something like:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5d755c9&amp;d=p00pd2pp2pl2pr2e60ei2eo2c72ic4an2au2a00ar2a51l20lr0li2lt2lv0sb0sa0sg2ev0&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
None of what you're mentioning would be purely cosmetic tho...
---
Yeah you're right. I forgot about that. The workshop point does make sense. So for that reason, I have nothing against being murdered. But any other time, I'd rather be left to my own devices.
---
An attack against me? You're the white knight running to this twits defense because you think being told they provided absolutely nothing of value is the worst thing ever. 
---
Thanks ! :)
---
Ah. Well I have the barn walls and the defense one.
---
Someone was telling me about conduits so I wiki'd them and it still says they're misnamed, but wikis do tend to be a bit lagged behind.
---
You can't taste me over my super awesome Blackbird paint.....
---
Plus bars *cough* windows to conduct a zero cap trade through. 
---
If none will create one for Android, i guess I will learn some Java to make it :)
---
At least they finally fixed Barn Walls not giving you Barn Walls, but all the power connectors instead...
---
How did they fuck that up?!
---
A supermutant dj could be cool lmao
---
Purple lämp superior, change my mind.
---
All good man. Appreciate the reply.
---
Yeah I found I liked the double barrel shotgun and Combat rifle. So I invested a lot of points into cards that help those weapons out and it makes a big difference. Only wish they had a weight reducing perk card for rifles because I’d love to carry a sniper as well.
---
I like crafting so I pumped points into weapons and armour crafting because I only want to use gear I find or make. Don’t want to trade or buy etc
---
I like the chance to repair armour when hit and chance to repair weapons when using.
---
Realistically I know I could tweak my build. Maybe I’m just trying to be a jack of all trades.
---
I love pharma farma and the dog food one haha. 
---
Some of the time they want to fast travel for free.
---
Some of the time they want the perks they have for team to equip.
---
Some of the time they just want to know where your base is to grief it.
---
I generally don't accept friend invites unless I'm trading on the trading reddit.  I don't really want to deal with #3 on that list.
---
I got something like the black fishermen's outfit I think I was called or something like that right at the end of beta. In case atoms was reset. Then I got the astro turf due to not finding a good place for my tent, and I got the vault tec paint for leather armour
---
In an ideal world I would swap to melee/heavy/auto...something like:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=ff13e17&amp;d=s42sq2s32sn1sr2ib4ip2ir2id2a00pg2ph2pq1pi2pp2lt2la2sm0e60pe0ev0cu0cm0l20&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
I was checking the Atom store for some reason and saw it there, grabbed it immediately.  But it was by chance more than anything.
---
I had 3 mole rats spawn in total
---
I don't get this sub..
---
Half the time the game is a "Money grab/asset flip"
---
The other half it's
---
"I wish the game had x feature/system/cosmetics from the prior game."
---
I found some TS weapons (LAR, Combat Rifle) but never something OP like this. And tbh, Im not even mad about it. Every game needs the ultimate endgame grind, and if TSE pumps are your thing, you goto put these hours into it. It's normal in most other rng based games too, so why not in FO76 :) 
---
I can build you one, but don’t have any legendary or plans unfortunately. 
---
my camp is in a remote location and i always go to area chat and tell people to stay away if they start getting near, because i know this exact sequence of events will happen
---
if they ignore me, i start shooting at them to try to scare them off but some people will just put confused emotes and walk towards my camp anyways thinking im a griefer... and yeah, deathclaw hits them, they hit deathclaw and get a bounty then i have to kill them in revenge
---
The Raider bots are pretty cool, Resin with his singing is my favorite
---
Get ammo smith and super duper, you will be swimming in shotgun ammo. Also people vend it on the forums for like 3 to a cap.
---
Or the Fat Man - which I tend to blow myself up with too when I tried using it.  No - I didn't not buy that skin.
---
It’s not intended to be a respec, it’s intended to be a tweak.  When my build got into the 60’s I realized I had a lot of wasted point in endurance for my build because perks like “cannibal” were no longer relevant when I had a healing mutation and ample stimpaks.  So a quick couple runs through white springs and I was able to move a  few points to let me flesh out my build a little more accurately.  
---
If you want a new build, make a new character.  Moving points is just for fine tuning the one you already made.
---
I like the Mayor too. I wish he had more dialogue with our PCs and he had more involvement in with more quests and just overall banter. 
---
Charisma increases sale prices (from you to vendor) makes most things the vendor sells cheaper (outside 'set price' items like serums, unless you have a certain perk on) and there's also the fact that Cha/3 determines the 'point cost' of perks you can share with your team
---
Yep, Destiny 1 &amp; 2. It's great because you can move things around while the game is loading. You can also access the menu so you can customize your character during loading screens.
---
But i don't know that the Bethesda people ever play other games.
---
Another GREAT plan name: Antique lights
---
I thought they were the swirly, decorative wall lamps. NOPE. CANDLE AND LANTERN. 
---
ANTIQUE CANDLES EVERYONE. COME GET YOUR ANTIQUE CANDLES.
---
They actually give off a very nice glow btw, so it wasn't too bad after all.
---
Thanks for the link! I'll read more about it tonight, but it looks like a good explanation.
---
Can you remove that last beam on the top or is it stuck there?  Also does it interfere with any other snapping to the sides of the stairs?  Could you build floors out from the middle level for example?
---
pip boy skin, and probably going to buy these tuxedos as well. Even after the pip boy, I still have like 2400 atoms built up from just playing the game (not even looking up challenges to get more). Kinda want laminate floors too, but not 100% sure yet.
---
I concur though, some of the prices for things are crazy if you are shelling out additional cash for them!
---
Bethesda? *&lt;shrug&gt;*  
---
Yeah, I’ve noticed this too.  
---
It comparatively does the same damage as a Power Fist while weighing nearly twice as much.  
---
I use it out of habit. In older titles the DCG ignored a certain amount of armour/DR IIRC so I’m hoping that’s the case here.  
---
Until I get a Bloodied Power Fist though I’m probably never gonna swap.
---
Actually I made a post about this and lot of people are with the same problem. Bethesda is aware.. but we dont known when they are gonna fix it. We hope soon cause make a Camp its half of the fun in fo76
---
I got the Blackbird Power Armor paint for the free atoms I've earned.  Totally worth it, love the paintjob.
---
I'll probably get a normal outfit when I see one that looks cool.  So far it's mostly 50's retro hippie stuff.  Waiting on a cool brotherhood or enclave soldier outfit.
---
You're welcome to experiment and let us know if any extreme values do something, but yes, it does appear to be a flat line once you hit those thresholds.
---
You might as well use a T-60 in that case - cheaper to repair.  The Excavator still takes a ton of springs to repair.
---
Not at all true. Especially in major and chaotic battles. I agree that some kind of "chip away" for pacifist strategy would be nice. Just tricky to implement. 
---
Yeah same here.. haven't dealt with many griefers personally.  I'm just holding on to the hope that they do it because they're bored and will quit soon =/
---
I can confirm neo's comment as well.  They know and they're fixing it.
---
I second this. I want to play more Grognak while I'm pooping!
---
Try a handmade rifle. You can mod it to be agreat sniper and the ammo takes less resources ti make. 
---
You're gonna have to ask a middleman, there's a discord for them somewhere
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TLi69pVxFZlYv6pQcRNJoHDVtZqraIk-InlA_ThEgPU/edit#gid=458255687
---
I've killed the queen about a dozen times now, never dropped a Serum from her, and not seen any serums sold for less than 2k, or more, caps personally.
---
Achievement unlocked:  Party-popper
---
Yeah I agree the system could use some tweaks to clean it up a bit.  
---
Unfortunately for Australasia we’re relying on Australia for most of our data hosting, and Aussie is notorious for its awful internet infrastructure.
---
Also get scrapper and fight some mutants with all those laser rifles you will be swimming in plastic.
---
Easiest solution that they won’t implement are PvE and PvP servers. On PvE, you cannot do damage to another player or their camp. 
---
I'm pretty sure that I got the combat armor plans from the brotherhood recruitment quests. 
---
there should be some in watoga high school
---
Oh really?? No wonder i haven't been able to find a blast zone these past couple of days...
---
Haha looks like it.
---
But no,  I used it to add information instead of the edit button.
---
Scrolling? What is this Geocities?
---
Ditto. Looking forward to logging in to see if this is fixed today... although I doubt it since they had the keycards and passcodes carry over an extra week for the holidays. My guess is that they fucked up the code to do that and so on Tuesday... bam... it screwed up the quest.
---
Then you either didn't notice or didn't login in the first couple of weeks. Literally every time I logged in to a stored camp, there were duped items to replace the crops that vanished into the void.
---
The issue is that the game launched right before the multi holiday season, so we were bound to get more playful items rather than dirty badass stuff. 
---
So I get it. I expect we'll get more "serious" options in the future.
---
Horrible? Nah. Impatient? YES! Bad raider!
---
You get the free stuff first, then you kill him and take what he has left over! Bwahahahahah... 
---
I mean yeah, thats how you do it.
---
Because there’s no PVP. Game is broken 
---
There are two SPECIAL scores that your character will have.  One is determined by you, and is the amount of Perk Cards you can have in that particular category.  The other SPECIAL stat is the state of your scores used by the game to interpret attribute values and modifiers.  This second SPECIAL score, viewable from your pipboy, uses your Perk value SPECIAL as a base, and then is impacted by modifiers.  So while a +1 to Charisma from a piece of gear will get you a better selling price from a vendor, it will not let you equip another perk card on Charisma.
---
Hmmm...
---
Press and hold V.  Tab to modify.  R to scrap.
---
Glare at rest of turrets to see who feels uppity. 
---
The whole system feels like an afterthought tbh. Like "It'd be weirder if we couldn't do PVP so here you go I guess" 
---
sorry i should have clarified [Atom's Judgement](https://cdn.gamer-network.net/2016/usgamer/Fallout-4-Far-Harbor-Atoms-Judgement.jpg)
---
Most of the vendors seem to carry them - I don't recall exactly which of the vendors I got the various ones from.  My vendor list included Grafton Station, Pleasant Valley, Camden Park, Welsh and I might have gotten the last one from Watoga during a daily vendor caps run.
---
You have no idea because you don't know what perks and mutations he has at the time.
---
Adrenal Reaction, shotgun perks, Demo, etc. could all be raising the damage you see there.
---
Yes, you can remove the beam when you get to the height that you want; yes, you can then build your flooring out from any level; as for snapping walls to the sides, I assume you can, although I have not tried to completely enclose the stairs.  When I use this - I'm typically placing the stairs in a corner of the house, to be as unintrusive as possible.
---
Is the normal shotgun 15 pellets? If so double that to 270 for two shot, and if they’ve already got Demo Expert that would be an extra 540 on top of the regular DPS.
---
I do all the dailies/weeklies and spend my free atoms on C.A.M.P. items... just got me that goldfish lamp. I'm not spending a dime until they lower the prices though.
---
It's been happening for me since November
---
My boyfriend and I have been doing a series of tacky vacation photos and some of the locations. So bummed there’s a 50 picture limit
---
While I know that what you described is a thing, I sure hope it's not that widespread, because that's an irresponsible 25k server interactions in a short amount of time. Antisocial behaviour like that will stress out and lag servers more than the actual duping itself.
---
I'm playing on PS4, so no hotkey scripts, but whenever I use the turbo button on my controller to quickly craft 40 boiled water I can witness the lag that that causes myself. And I get a bad conscience every time ('Did I just cause someone to see the Server Not Responding tag?'). Sure, crafting is slightly more complicated, and there is some Super Duper (no pun intended!) RNG to calculate as well, but even a few thousand cola chugs are totally out of line. 
---
yeah getting it too, this happened to me on a few steam games i think one of them was FF15 and there was some key you press to fix it like shift+enter or something if i remember correctly, cant find anything to help fix this though =/
---
That thing seriously takes paint to repair? Wth.
---
Well, outright silly has been part of the Fallout universe for far longer than fortnite has existed. 
---
As in 20 years before it existed. 
---
So, yeah. Just because you don't enjoy the sillier side of the wasteland doesn't mean it was ripped off from fortnite. 
---
Yeah I was looking for this type of setup since my first 2-story attempt =P  Thanks for the post.. i'll be giving it a shot soon!
---
its for a quest, they dont do anything if you dont have the quest
---
Ugh that sucks! Hopefully it's just a display error and it'll show the right thing next time you log on.
---
The game needs the ability to manually set VATS priorities.  Job done. 
---
I've only found one treasure map, is there a way to find more or is it totally random?
---
Sure getting your hands on one of those TSE weapons is nice. But personally I don't feel it benefits me as the buyer. The weapon balance is really off in fallout games. You can get away with it mostly in singleplayer games. But if you use overpowered weapons the game becomes really boring. I get it some enemies can be bullet sponges. Its just the type of game fallout is. Running out one shotting pretty much everything and bugging loot in the process is going to make you leave this game even faster. 
---
I see what you are saying though. But I would imagine it would also affect smaller traders that actually just have those 1 or 2 legendaries they found or bought. Plus with mats, weaps pouring out of every quest, mob and duper will cause 0 demand. Some people want to vendor ingame. Not a big fan of it myself but I understand it.
---
I'm down for tackling an Android version
---
please, no New Vegas music, I hate that stuff.  Would prefer FO3 music or new stuff in the same genre.
---
I don't even think we have One Dog yet. Well, there is one dog in FO76, but don't let that confuse you.
---
Yeah, not obvious, i didn't realize either until someone pointed it out to me. Same with all mirrors or cabinets in bathrooms etc.
---
What platform are you on ? If you on XB1, maybe me or someone can go with you to that place to try get that recipe for you.
---
It released twice...first time was a disaster...research it and you will see
---

---
I really don't see the need for 3 different weights to begin with.. It seems excessive.
---
Only energy go up to highest levels. They are the future right? They should perform like it.
---
Well served justice
---
It’s not quite that they are indestructible, just that they would take forever to break enough of to get to the workshop, and filled basically the entire capture area so it’s hard to take the workshops. For sure a hilarious defense, but nowadays everyone would TSE gun their way through in no time.
---
Like a used car salesman moving all the cars around on the lot because a customer wants the one parked in the back corner. 
---
They care about something, but it's certainly not any of this. :(
---
Sure, what’s the gt?
---
The loot is based on your level, so it is worth holding onto all the maps you find until you hit level 50.
---
I am God....
---
Very cool idea. I love the simplicity. 
---
One suggestion: POI toggles for Stash box locations, workbench types and map areas (i.e. The Mire, Toxic Valley)
---

I punch for 45 and bleed. This might be a bit unbalanced
---
This.  100 is a meaningless sample size, as your margin of error is going to be on the order of double-digits. 
---
.......... no
---
The daily quest they are used for is started out of a water treatment plant. Every time you get it, it picks a random soil/water/air sensor around the map for you to check
---
Uhhh.. yesterday I got like 2 glowing yao guai, 2 normal yao guai, 6+ glowing honeybeasts, 2 schorche beasts.. i was almost concerned with my safety.

A normal shotgun is 7 pellets. A two-shot is 8 pellets.

Honestly, i bought the rocket bed out of the Atomic Shop. Love it!

WOW, GTAO, and many, many other online games have substantial issues in their first month.  I remember the constant bitching when Diablo 3 launched about how people couldn't even log in reliably for weeks.  There are other games I can't remember the names of that get hit reddit's front page when they release,  filled with complaints.
---
45 caps
---
If you can pop the engines they get easier and slower
---
I never considered using ramps for split level stuff, or using the roof as part of the walkway, it's a super cool idea!
---
I have had rare things disappear from vendor stocks right before my eyes. MODUS had a headlight mod, vats mod and stealth boy. I backed out of the vendor to equip hard bargain. In the 10 seconds that took the stealth boy was no longer there - all other inventory was the same.
---
Last night I had the same thing happen in watoga; checked Phoenix and he had the signs and letters plan. Backed out to use grape mentats and the plans were gone.
---
Thank you for this. I added it in, let me know if you have any others! I didn't fully flesh out a lot in the materials portion, I plan to upgrade it with links, locations and better descriptions. 
---
I do have some idea because I have a TSE shotgun with a similar damage value and I have no shotgun or explosive specific perks.
---
PVP in this game is wonky but something must be missing for you to have had so much trouble. If you were in a group and you were some how getting killed by high levels then someone on your team initiated combat, which opened the -whole team- up to be killable. That means someone on your team either wasn't on pacifist mode or attacked an asset one of the players on the opposing team owned (like a C.A.M.P. or workshop). I don't know why it works this way other than I assume having party members who can provide PVP benefits while staying immune from PVP would be "unbalanced" (not that PVP is balanced anyway).    
---
Absolutely nothing else would result in you getting killed so easily and repeatedly. The shared PVP responsibility of being in party with other people isn't very clearly stated however which sucks.
---
I'm level 90 and I don't have it 
---
Sounds good. Will add those as well! 
---
That's a good workaround, but it doesn't answer the question of "why are there legendary rolling pins (for example) and not legendary hunting rifles?"
---
He asked at the end how to obtain another one, so it was basicay "How do I get another card?" "Just get another card."

---
Still got 2k atoms.  Bethesda pays me to play their game
---
Super nice, love how she went ahead and made herself have a thicc waist and made you like a full foot taller than her.
---
i randomly get responses. i will just start yellin in the MIC if we are doing an event. WE numba #1 and stuff like that people typically turn on their mic and start joking.
---
I think most people just do not have their mic hooked up and are just hearing the sound through their speakers. If you talk quite and only once or a twice they may miss it?
---
IDK
---
I haven't seen one drop in a while now.  Dunno if that means anything.
---
This is really great, it's got a lot of stuff the other maps don't have. One thing I would love to see that is never in these maps is work benches. A lot of times I need a specific workbench and have no idea where the closest one is. 
---
No worries man.  
---
Only with atoms I have obtained in game I have not and will not spend any real money on the atom store.
---
Page is blocked at work, but I'm sure that's going to be an objective, fact-based article.
---
I can 100% confirm this.   I always play with friends and on getting dropped from a server rejoining often changes vendor inventory (although the available caps either a) stay the same or b) drop to zero).
---
YOUR WINNER
---
Okey doke 
---
Are the maps one-time use, or should I hang onto duplicates?
---
And people who might have unknowingly picked up or traded for these super duper secret unique ID items? They get banned too?  
---
You misunderstand the excavator carry weight bug. Currently the bug is in the player favor- you get an “extra” 100 when you log in in the armor, until you exit it. If they fix it, you’ll just lose that extra 100 log in bonus.
---
I can’t believe there wasn’t a crash somewhere in the middle of all that. 
---
Lvl 111 and never thought of this...
---
I didn't realize people were against the idea of PvP servers. Hell. I think it's great. 
---
I don't think you understand statistics, bud. If it's 1% or below makes very little difference. Your likelihood of getting the item you need is tiny once it's below 1%. This gives you some idea of what to expect though.
---
If I'm being mobbed (which usually happens when I can bring myself to haul my character out to Whitesprings *once more*) I need to be able to jump up and away to fire into the crowd, either with a heavy or my explosive Gauss.

Not mine but thought I'd share. It's helping me a lot I was spawning under water and now I'm not I spawn at my front door. 😍
---
They seemed fitting! I kinda wanted this to be a stand-alone, self-sufficient plant where people could stop by to pick up some purified water on their way to Harper’s Ferry.
---
My issue was the fact that I had to go there to progress the main story line (which I wasn’t very far into). Getting there was a huge challenge, and seeing that I then had to go search for something where I had just encountered a high level Sentrybot made me want to ignore the main quest even further. 
---
They wouldn't if you went about it this way
---
Perhaps I just sound too boring for them 😜
---
I pick the lock on the trailer at the Gorge all the time for friends who control the workshop and it doesn't count as stealing and I don't get a bounty as long as I'm in their party.
---
Do the same thing and I'm not in their party and I do.
---
Meh. 
---
Another "Bethesda strayed too far from Fallout...." Article. 
---
Everyone seems to forget that Bethesda essentially fished that IP out of the dumpster and used it as the backbone for a new series of games. 
---
Worked for me as well. Annoying this glitch is still around a month later
---
Rose is my raider queen. I want to fees her chems...
---
I would love this. Both times I received a team up invite it was from players who were level 100+ (I'm around 25) and wanted to clear workshops or power plants with enemies twice as strong as me. Like thanks for the invite but I would rather not be used as bait.

How to give blackbird paint to a friend.
---
1.Make them drop their chassis
---
2.Paint it for them
---
3.Pit chassis in storage and take it back out
---
(This removes the atom logo from the chassis making it droppable)
---
4.Drop it back to your friend.
---
You’re welcome 
---
Yeah, there are greenhouses in the game already, agree this would be nice.
---
PvE, PvP, and Survival servers. I know people who only played FO in survival mode. Totally different game. 
---
I am a damn fool. You are completely right. 
---
I guess i should at ieast let the guy die knowing he's accomplished one thing in his life. 
---
There is a military fatigues underarmor. I wear it. (Int and Cha bonuses, which since I only get out of my PA to craft and sell, is perfect)
---
I did my mutations back in the day at the waste disposal site with the shower. Hours and hours. Lol
---
Out of curiosity (I’m not at my PC right now) do the Pump and Combat Shotgun share stats?  
---
Normally I’d agree that they theoretically should but this is a video game where a shell can inexplicably have more pellets in it because it’s in a different gun for balance reasons. It wouldn’t surprise me if the Pump did more damage per shell to offset the reloading mechanism.
---
I don't know how it works in fallout, but a lot of games assign unique identifiers to each instance of an object. Depending on the game, there are ways to detect whether an item is a drop or whether it was duplicated.
---
What's going to suck is when people lose stuff or get dinged for having a duped item they had no idea was duped. 
---
Sure, I'll add ya tonight. I saw something about the silo's being bugged, so I'm aiming for sometime closer to the weekend. Let me know if Friday or Saturday works for you.
---
forgot to mention
---
poseidon power plant during event and Charleston - (low level)
---
* Primary resources: 10mm, .308, shotgun shells, .38, .45, steel, adhesive
---
* Secondary resources: acid, plastic
---
(in the workshop area there is locked door you can access after getting the Poseidon hazmat storage key, in it, you will find hallucigen gas canister you can either use these to make phantom devices or scrap them for 5 acid. after you're done here go to charleston and kill the snallgasters for more acid and some leather)
---
I think it's because they don't want to have to admit that PVP isn't as popular as they want it to be and would have low server populations.
---
As it stands, they can get their jollies by killing people that don't have interest in PVP.  The servers would not have those.  Everybody would be after everybody else all the time.
---
They want to grief, not be griefed.
---
The trick is you make two foundation squares and place your generator, wires, ANYTHING you need wired up goes there. That’ll blueprint separately. Here’s the magicians reveal: use the advanced power connectors power pipe conduits. It’s the only way you will be able to run electricity throughout your entire camp because once you’re over budget you’re not making anymore wires
---
I have to admit it but I find the lack of a stronger storyline with large amounts of people and dialogue options/dialogue in general does make the game less engaging. 
---
AKA everything will be coming SOON^TM
---
Oh man, I am so sorry. I tried the natural route, and got egghead four times in a row, so... yeah. 
---
They are glowing flowers growing on the side of trees.
---
This definitely works. I've previously used my wife's account to keep the roaming responder bot in place while I kept quiting and rejoining her game. It took a while, but eventually he had the hunters long coat. His inventory changed every time.
---
Can't wait to dump my TSE guns in the machine and not have to worry about tracking down some asshat on the bazaar who doesn't even have the caps or the trade.
---
Most important to me is that the T-60 legs are so much cheaper to run. Repairing them only takes some aluminium, adhesives and steel. No springs or anything fancy.
---
Because everyone on the same server &amp; all radios in the world are synched so they all play the same song at the same time. If you add a new song in the mix it would throw everything out of whack. Now, you \*could\* purchse and entirely new station/playlist that would unlock on your PipBoy, but with the going rate, that'd probably cost you $80-100 in Atoms.
---
I just found the body (not helmet) plans the other night... don’t remember where, sorry, but I’m on PC, I can give you a suit if you want (I made one to check it out and Super Duper’d it :)

Haha, fair enough. It was just funny to me because I was scrolling through the comments and saw the little "OP" icon and got confused for a second. Happy Post-apocalyptic New Year :)

**AWESOME!** I'll add this the the other [Fallout 76 maps](http://www.falloutcounter.com/fallout76-maps/index.php) worth sharing...
---
I'm level 25...... Plus 100
---
Yeah I thought "what do rich people have" then I remembered "1 room with multiple heights"  
---
Like the raised bar at a club ect...  
---
so started using the ramps to try and vary up a room without having to put in the ugly ass walls since there's no interior walls
---
I think a lot of people don't know how to turn on area voice chat tbh 
---
As usual thanks heaps for doing this list each week S. The community loves all the work you do in collecting and cataloguing all of it for the live team. 
---
+1 buddy here i will try to add more.
---
》Explain the use of the 2+ INT PA mod and what benifits it has. If it has no benifit please consider changing the data base mod. Also consider looking at the other mods for the PAs are consider their use in 76 ovet FO4.
---
》 This idea is too good to sum up in a few lines.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aadhh3/suggestion_earn_commendations_to_purchase_mods/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
》 Really hard to tell people who have added you as friends and want an accept and those offline. Please give us a proper pending tab in social. Over the current little dot next to their name appearing as offline. This is an issue when you have alot on your list.
---
》Add sliders to crafting over spamming the button so it heavily takes stress off the servers when someone spam crafts. That why i can set it to build say 10,000 5mm bullets at once instead of spamming the button and almost crashing the server.
---
》 This one has no solution suggested. But sometimes you have to wait a few minutes for loot to show up on killed enemies. This is a major issue in nuke zone like Whitespring. It would be nice if somehow the loot was almost pre determined on the mob spawn. Even if it means that mob drops the same items for all who tag it.
---
》 Things like the New Years Event you need to announce in game not just on social media like twitter. Including the disabling of nukes for the day in game with a very clear message as to why. This question flooded reddit regarding this. Like a pop up banner similarly to your annoying atom ones...
---
》 Grappling hook mod for Power armor sets as a different type of arm mod. 
---
》 We need to be able to change all font sizes. This suggestion was posted by someone who is partially blind and was frustrated by the lack of accessibility features in Fallout 76.
---
》 Don't want to sum this one up i think the suggestions needs the full post to go with it.

》 Allow party hat and the 2076 glasses to be used at the same time.
---
》 Allow us to invite someone to our server and group at the same time. Instead of just the option to join their server as this is really annoying setting things up.
---
Haha, that’s a lot of plus.
---
the game is still fairly active, but there is a bug that is stopping nukes from being launched so may want to wait till next patch
---
Omg I love you
---
Sweetness
---
Yeah. You need more. I spent two days grinding this out. I saw the stealth boy twice and calibrated shocks twice. Never saw the jet pack.
---
I have maxed out all Sneak/Stealth Perks, and use all Legendary Armor with Chameleon, Cloaking, +Agility, &amp; "Become harder to detect while sneaking " perks, I even have to keep moving around when interacting with other players cause I completely disappear, but I can only hide from a SB, if I don't move when they are facing me.
---
Those Evil creatures have better Perception than Ticks &amp; Molerats, which spawn around me, but cant find me.
---
Scorchbeasts attacks are explosive, get padded/dense torso mod
---
Also scales depending on how many players there are.
---
I'm only seeing yellow
---
Also can we put workbenches inside the tent instead of on top?
---
Works at the light house too 
---
Thanks for putting this together!
---
I've been doing quite a bit of this myself this past week. I still have yet to see a Stealth Boy or whatever Reactive Plates are, but I've seen and procured most of the rest. Targeting HUD has popped up a few times, while Jet Pack and Calibrated Shocks have only shown up once each.
---
I also wonder about the "shared" items idea. I have a hard time understanding how it would work though. I mean, if so, the vendor would constantly be out of all the mods, right, since the servers persist for quite a long time? And if they refresh, when and how often?
---
Keep us posted with whatever else you find out!
---
`The matrix has you...`

Appalachia is a computer simulation and the bugs and disconnects are glitches in the system. In fact, we're still in Vault 76, asleep, hooked up to a shared dream machine like in Inception.

This games enjoyment depends on your personal game's stability. You're not going to be having fun at 150 if you can't even fight the SBQ because you DC every time.

Ash heap mole miners
---
I just launched a nuke last week - what happened?
---
I found a trick for this one that might help you if they do more events to “kill legendaries” in the future. :) There’s an event in the NW called “Leader of the Pack” where you have to kill 3 wolf leaders and all three are low level legendaries. So just hop around and do that event, you’ll get 3 legendary kills each time!
---
If we took the time to point out all of the failures in the game, we'd never have time to play.
---
Dear Bethesda, how about hitting a target with VATS when it is at 95% and I'm 5ft away with a shotgun and let loose with 5 rounds.
---
As of right now, I wouldn't bother. It fails to work half the time and nothing more than 20 feet away seems to glow anyway.
---
I'm with you on the shared inventory thing, I think that this is the case. Many times I have encountered vendors that had been nearly cleaned out of plans and mods. Like Watoga station I have seen a number of times where the only plan it had was radium rifle. The problem is there are cases where it is instanced (like the random event vendor), some where it is shared, and even items guaranteed. So they everything is just a mess of hearsay and theories, mostly because there system lacks any reasonable consistency. 
---
"How Bethesda killed Fallout for *me*" would have been a more accurate title. I guess some people just want some Aristotle level philosophy from a fucking *video game*.
---
I've had trouble with those frames. I can't seem to snap them together, nor get them to snap to walls after I put up the wall. Seems I gotta start with the frame/ladder. Any tips?
---
What platform are you on? I can give you a full set of lvl 45 raider if your on xbox
---
The game was exactly as they advertised it.  The bugs are hit and miss.  I just got my "played 76 hours" achievement last night and I have only had 1 or 2 crashes and a weird graphical glitch with the tesla rifle so I cant really complain.  
---
While you're correct, there's no need for that 'tude, dude.
---
If you hate the game so much why follow it on Reddit? 
---
This is also really annoying if you are the 100+ guy. sometimes  I just want to clear an area and don't mind adding the guy close to team since I have char6 with armor and can even buff to 9 in base. I use that at camp sometimes when playing with friends. However the scaling makes it really awkward. Better of just leaving randoms/low lv behind or try to not get them killed.
---
Not on PS4
---
You can dig the mound for each duplicate. Might need to World hop though, not 100% on that. 
---
Lots on that list are far from qol fixes.
---
Quite a few look like sweeping buffs for no other reason than because.
---
》 Things like the New Years Event you need to announce in game not just on social media like twitter. Including the disabling of nukes for the day in game with a very clear message as to why. This question flooded reddit regarding this. Like a pop up banner similarly to your annoying atom ones. Just to add the nuke turn off is supposedly a bug not intended but we need more heads up in general. None of us knew what was going on all day.
---
》 Fast traveling to friends should bring you to their location. This can be really annoying when say a level 30 asks for your help in the class caves but bugger if you gotta spend ages finding inside.
---
alot of 'auto' weapons are deceptively frail
---
K
---
Just like last month, get your wallet ready.
---
Because Bethesda is more concerned with slick PR speak than actually hiring someone who knows how to speak to their paying customers.
---
This is why they won't face any of the larger problems like server crashes and instability and just keep on talking about upcoming features (which will still have broken servers)
---
and a Kar98
---
Because no one does, the stories portrayed here are far and few between. 
---
If they advertise it more the anti mx people are totally gonna loose their shit. 
---
Remember that little reminder about how to change player icon showed up ONCE when opening the map? Remember the reactions?
---
Yup.... thats how sad some are.
---
Lol. Look how cranky you are about someone trying to help. Nobody wants to help people like you. The worst thing ever? Now I know you're a kid with that kind of drama.

 **The Mire Treasure Map #5**  took me forever to find, even with the guide. Best advice I can give is go 3rd person and use your pip-boy light
---
Some @$$ took Grafton Steel from me and built, like, 6 sirens and about a hundred powered speakers and then logged off. Then I went to re-take it and my dog ran and hid.
---
What I’ve seen posted has been duplicate plans you just loot the mound twice. I’ve never received a duplicate plan yet so cannot confirm. 
---
same issue here too, it let me dig it the first time, but not for the other 3 copies of that map i have for Toxic Valley #03 
---
Is this the south side of the forest past the river?

I use Rejuvenated since low level. Never take it out. It's just too good for 2 points!

You'd think with all the water gathering, we could make a post apocalyptic washing machine.

some guy bitching that fallout seems different from fall out 1 to him or something.
---
How Bethesda killed fallout.....should be called why i don't like fallout anymore. Bethesda hasn't killed anything (yes it may feel like it with the game issues etc) just some random guy thinking he's the centre of the universe again and that redditors would like to /discuss because ya know bethesda killed fallout :/
---
I got 3 radium rifles from the abandoned waste cave(start of the enclave missions which I call death law cave) and my friend also got one so test ur luck there
---
I initially thought this said "chairs".
---
I was so excited to make a dance-floor with chairs stacked to the side like the high-school gym.
---
This is a good tip, too, though. :)
---
I just donate a lot of power armor. 
---
Lmao.
---
Once i figure out the html part im golden lol
---
Palace of winding path has them too, iirc
---
Target the engines if you can. They have way less armor. 
---
They absolutely would.  Your idea is garbage. Someone can drop a few excess weapons in a bag and anyone else in the server could pick it up. They don't know where those weapons came from, and neither would bethesda. 
---
The way you fix this issue is by balancing the weapons and making them obsolete with future content. 
---
Not banning people for playing the game.
---
I love my Tesla but can't use it around white springs. If a ghoul is too close to a bot then suddenly EVERYONE is hostile.
---
Well... I'm certainly never going to ignore this event ever again now.
---
Can't be seen by enemies you say? I suspected this but haven't seen anyone confirm it till now. Have you tested it?
---
Duplicates are multiple digs on same spot, i just you just dig deeper :)

Blood packs+chemist+super duper=lots of Stim packs
---
I agree.  It's not like they have to even do anything, as the assets are already made.  It's like printing money.
---
I am heavy weapons/rifle build. I carry a Gatling, Gatling Laser and Gatling Plasma (They are all like 3lbs max with Bear Arms 3). I'm working on swapping the Gatling Laser for an Ultracite Gatling laser but don't have the plans yet. The normal gatling hit the hardest per shot but is also the slowest per shot, works great for normal creatures. The Gatling Laser uses the fusion cores so works well for large swam groups. The Gatling Plasma does the highest RoF and has high damage per shot, however this breaks the gun VERY fast. I keeps the Plasma for large health single targets so every shot is a hit.

The forest goes all the way down to the Ash Heap.

Everytime i get in a pvp match, they always have TSE weapons. I dont have any legendaries since my drops are something like golf clubs or knives. Had a guy last night not even believe i had a TSE weapon. The kills were pretty even between us even though the 2v2 we had was a bit unbalanced sinc my partner was like lvl 20 and they were 120+. Needless to say it was....exciting. I personally still love the pvp in this game. 
---
The amount of flora and the number of ghouls/scorched lol
---
Ok, cheers. 
---
And when Whitesprings no longer nukes flora....
---
serendipity if you aren't using PA if you are put the points into charisma and take suppressor
---
For me I never found anything worth a damn until I hit level 100. Once I did I finally started finding 2 shot and explosive weapons.  RNG? Who knows 
---
Thank you for letting me know army laser weapons on the weak side in fallout 76
---
Ooo thatll be fun for other high leveled unarmed builds, whats ur gt, we can discuss how the arena can be built
---
Yeah, as much as I like the red look, I'm sticking with 'bright'
---
What’s your gt tho?
---
&gt;  ivory grip
---
precious rare plan!! win
---
/r/gaming, /r/fallout, /r/theouterworlds, and a few others are basically continuously brigading this sub.
---
Yea i figured thats where u were talking bout i only got a small portion done of the map tho takes quite a while to map all these out lol ill be working on north of vault 76 tonight and tomorrow along with south of the river tomorrow 
---
Nope.  Melee got a bit boring though so I went heavy weapons.
---
After many hours, I got grounded, chameleon, and marsupial. Stopped there and just started saving caps for serums. 
---
I got lucky and got an instigating sledgehammer and modded it to get 50 more damage and bleed and fire damage. But if ur really just using the kangaroo build u should get a slow hitting melee so u can get a heavy shot in and keep jumping 
---
Yes, my experience with them has been that the piece with the ladder must be placed first. All other frame pieces without ladders will have to be snapped to this first piece for said wall, so you may have to fiddle with the exact positioning of this piece a good bit to get it to work the way you want. The pieces w/o ladders will only snap to the ladder frames on one of their sides, so you may have to spin these pieces around a bit to see where the snapping marker is, but they can be snapped to other frame pieces side-by-side or at a 90° angle (and kinda clipping with one square of the frame piece you are clamping to). I have found that the wooden walls are the most forgiving when snapping to the outside of these frame pieces. All in all, if you have the contractor perk each frame piece costs about 3 wood and each wood wall panel costs 1 wood. Pretty cheap defenses; just gotta have patience and play around with the build mechanics a bit to get a feel for where the current system is temperamental and where it is more forgiving. Hope that helps!
---
The song is in the game though.
---
I have yet to do a 4v4 and honestly it makes me moist thinking about it. Lol
---
Not needed. The NCR Ranger Armor is just repurposed riot armor. The US was dealing with a lot of riots before the war and the military needed that kind of armor to stop the riots. Since in Appalachia, like Welsh for example, there were a ton of riots, they can just say its riot armor. 
---
I made a round of a couple places while leveling up to get armor. There are about 5 -6 within 5 mins of vault 76
---
Yeah... For me it's more concerning that there is no screenshot or video they can share to show progress. And instead decide to copy paste.
---
problem is that the harm is already done. There is no acceptable way of deleting all those items + remove the caps people gained from them. Even if they delete those items. People would have payed for them and those will lose and the guys who sold them win because they got caps or other stuff in exchange. 
---
And then there's people like me who loved the game at the start, bugs and all, but after losing those rose-tinted glasses (around level 40) I just starting resenting the game for everything it does wrong - from the materials grind to the bugs.
---
It's really easy to like a game when you start playing it which is where you get a lot of "hey I just got the game yesterday and it's great!" and those are all wonderful - really they are, but I'd bet there are an almost equal number of people whose frustration with the game has grown along with their level. 
---
I for one am glad that you've enjoyed the game all the way to level 70. I wish I did.
---
&gt; End Game should not force you into power armor, make the hazmat suit fit OVER or UNDER everything so you can wear it on top (or under) literally everything else. Some of us don't want to be in power armor and have designed our perks as such.
---
This is the one that really gets me.  I hate PA and have no desire to use it, but I have a set for nuke zones because I need some damage resistance.  It makes no sense at all why hazmat suit can't go over everything.  Just have it do -2 per or something along those lines the say way helmets are.
---
The new dress and blackbird paint. I reserve my atoms for upcomming PA skins.
---
Combine with level 2 rejuvenated and you'll be able to eat whatever and have 70% less chance of catching a disease from the food too.. Just a possibility. 
---
This exactly.
---
The legendary effects stack with perk effects to a maximum of 90%.
---
90% junk weight reduction is amazing.
---
“When you dupe an item, both items have the same "unique" ID.”
---
No. That physically would not be possible. The unique ID IS the item. You literally cannot have 2 unique ID’s. If they had the same ID they’d be treated as the same item, if someone scrapped one they’d both vanish, you break one they both break, etc. Actually before that the game simply wouldn’t be able to track it. It HAS to give it a new ID because otherwise it can’t track it as a new item. 
---
What you’re describing would be like having an original item, and then each “dupe” is really just a trans dimensional portal looking at the same item. That just... can’t work. If you “duped” me by opening a trans dimensional portal to view me, and then shot what you saw in the portal, you will kill me and I would die in every portal viewing me. That’s what would happen in your scenario of “every dupe having the same ID”. 
---
Its not too bad. Its just coming from a guy that loved fo 1-2 and everything after deviated from them.
---
LOL!
---
&gt;B) everyone's camps will be all over the damn place.
---
\*Clarifying this as someone might misunderstand and think you meant that camps will be all over west virginia, when in fact, they are all over whitesprings.
---
Gah.  Bright Headlamp shouldn't be as rare as it is.  I have been looking forever.
---
One of my first posts about fallout was the stats for this set. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9xvtkh/psa_eye_of_ra_bonuses/
---
This is also a drawback, im a lower level player, and when I enter an area that a high level play has passed through, I have to run. I haven't been able to explore white springs for this reason
---
What consoleeeeeeee?
---
i love these quests where you have to protect!
---
The image the Reddit app links is black and white but the link itself is in color
---
Unarmed is good? What are the good Unarmed builds?
---
I bought the Gridiron face paint.  That's been it, and I still have north of 2,100 Atoms.  I realize the rate you accumulate them slows down over time.  I don't object to the premise of buying Atoms, but truth be told, there's just not much in the store I want.  I like the haphazard, scavenged appearance of my character and most of the outfits hide that.  I don't build elaborate CAMPs either.
---
People that complain that PA breaks too fast are usually running a glass cannon setup. 
---
Here is a QOL fix I'd like to see.  
---
Show us an icon and a small timer of when a perk is engaged. Take Adrenaline for example... how do I know the perk is working or activated? I currectly have to go into my pip boy to see what is happening.  
---
Could it cause a flood of icons on the screen? Sure. But figure that out somehow lol.
---
Yes it is
---
My husband and I take and defend workshops together, happy to see another couple who aren't afraid to throw down!  
---
On another note, someone started attacking me at my camp this weekend for absolutely no reason at all. My husband beat him to a pulp with a super sledge then we both went to the guys camp and proceeded to blow it to smithereens. 
---
Bug bounties are real life things you know.
---
No what? I’ve seen mobs pick up items from nearby bodies, I’ve seen mobs pick up weapons I’ve dropped on the ground, I don’t see them grabbing something from a container as that much of a stretch
---
The fact that you don't even need the officers is annoying  you can just look the week's code up. Perhaps they're trying to address that.
---
Honestly no SBs for awhile sounds nice. 
---
Unless it's been fixed there is an issue with launching nukes
---
&gt;or v
---
There's also no direct addressing of various issues or even saying "we're aware of some stability issues and are hard at work on improving that aspect of the game"
---
Their strategy is simple: under promise, over deliver.
---
By never addressing anything, they're always delivering unless you look at what they're avoiding saying with a critical eye.
---
Silo's are currently closed due to a glitch. There should be a hot fix soon.
---
Quest is bugged at the moment, no one can do it
---
ahh thats smart, thanks. i was planning on setting the wired things down and then going way overbudget with everything else, but the pipe connectors will make it easier. god help me if i forget to wire a terminal before i go overbudget though.......
---
I'm not at my PC either but what information I can find says that all the shotguns have 7 pellets. They of course have different damage and other stats.
---
New to the game so yes currently a noob
---
The the event Heart of the Swamp something er other is in effect, they will spawn in that area, a lot. Other than that, only place I’ve seen is by that chemical plant once in a great while. 
---
With my eyes.
---
Every time I see this post (or variations of it), I grow more frustrated at the entire alpha/beta phase of the production cycle. They *should* have allowed more time between the beta and the official release. They *should* have asked for and incorporated more of these things. They *should* have playtested it enough to realize that their damn game crashes every 7 seconds (give or take). Instead, we got what we got and they were deservedly ridiculed and lambasted by the press and a large portion of the community.
---
I wish this game could be more like what it has the potential to be, and I continue to play it even with the ongoing frustrations, but man, from your fingers to god's eyes (to fudge the actual expression).
---
Its not too bad - just saw one for the X-01 last night.  Though I don't have Bright Headlamp on the Excavator.
---
Nuke silos are bugged as of yesterday. Bethesda said they will be hot fixing at some point today 
---
Right? It's very annoying. 
---
It causes everyone to crash out so yes it does affect me. Wait till private servers come so they dont destroy the economy and cause people to ctd.
---
Swapped servers and found both there, thank you!
---
Bought a couple of floors and the holiday bundle because I wanted the twinkling lights and the T51 Xmas Paint ..  I am now broke, but I am happy with my purchases ..  also displaying the snowman. I think the items will me limited editions and only available at Xmas, so a lot of people might be in awe for a little while. The snowman will get old fast, but the lights can be used year round ..
---
My purchases are strategic, I only buy what I really want, I would never spend real money so back to the grind to get my atoms back up, blew $3K on those items and am now broke.
---
I seem to get at least one or two everytime I run the Violent Night at the Dane Compound from the ghoul corpses
---
Saw one guy last night with nearly 1 million Nuka Quantums.
---
People find that grating manic schtick charming? Wow. Really? Yikes. Cheers to you.
---
Fo1-2 were so niche. I was pc gaming on a potato then and NO ONE cared about those games.
---
The story/world was great, the format was dated when new genres were emerging.
---
Xcom 1/2 and MOO were pushing things and diablo 1 was crushing it.
---
I had stuttering issues with borderless fullscreen, when I switched to fullscreen it went away. I've seen a few other people who had a similar experience. Probably not the issue but might be worth a try. 
---
I have a theory about this. Either, the daily reset happened at this exact moment, or the game hadn't properly loaded the vendor list (in the same way it often doesn't load your stash until you mouse over/interact with it.
---
I have a powerarmor that says its 2
---
brb getting rich and buying split level rooms
---
No worries. Keep up the good work! 
---
I always wondered what they were all for, thanks. 
---
Good luck, I will say HW has been the most fun and frustrating to play. They break too dang fast, really needs to be adjusted across the board for the heavy weapons. However it is fun to just stand in front of a target and go "HELLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOO!" until it falls over.
---
All of the above.
---
I agree with his, I know it's our nature to compare to real cash, but it's really not if you earned it for free, but I can see why people do it. Prices are still absurd but we also don't want everyone having the same items, so maybe it is ok in the long run else everyone can afford anything and then what is the point.
---
You would love wurm online/unlimited then.
---
100 people are not working on this game 
---
First play through, finish bortherhood quest. See power armor chassis in inventory. Huh that's weird, scrap it. Later realize it was a full suit of ultracite PA...
---
Second play through, finish brotherhood quest. Oh this must be that ultracite! Deploy it to take a look. Yep! Try to pick it back up. Only level 30. Can't store the whole frame. Walk back to camp severely over-encumbered. Store 100ish pounds of PA in the stash box. Ughhh
---
Precisely why its going to likely be only habitual offenders are punished. Lets say 30 times or more is the area. If the items were consumables who cares. If they are weapons or armor punishment time. Additionally if that method works that youve suggested very few legit players should have found themselves with duplicated ids.
---
i have one with 4x Mag Capacity, happy it only reloads 5 in the moment :D 
---
Let me see it again after the fix :X
---
Just FYI, matresses on the floor actually lower your interpreted wealth
---
That helps! Sounds like it removes the 45° option with concrete, but if wood snaps to it, even better!
---
Hey, I'll still read the article later. But just because a game studio doesn't replicate earlier successes is no reason to say it's the end of the world. If you look at the profits BGS made off of FO4 alone, they obviously thought they were doing well.
---
Vendors sell them from time to time
---
Literally couldn't tell you. Sometimes it is in a building, sometimes I am just exploring the wasteland, sometimes with friends, sometimes without. I don't do anything with my camp and have never taken over a workshop yet so not anything to do with them 
---
I typically dump it at a train station suitcase. I used to try ad give it away to random low level players, but more often then not they are ungrateful and don't really care, from my experiences. 
---
Oh that is genius. Must have been annoying but what a way to use that bug/mechanic haha.
---
 "I fired a few "get the hell off my property!" rounds in his general direction as he fled."  
---
Totally worth the read right there.  
---
These encounters are even better when you have a game breaking weapon to one shot people.
---
I mean, maybe?  I guess there's some of everything, but at level 225 i'm still having fun with my friends.  Sucks about the nukes being shut down today, plenty of complaints, but it sucks because I want to nuke stuff.
---
awesome.  Now I won't spawn inside the face of a cliff any more
---
Theres a farm area down near there too that has a literal ton of razorgrain 
---
The SBQ drops the serum recipes (rarely). You can also buy serums themselves at the Enclave base in the Robotics (?) wing but they’re very expensive.
---
Yea 1800 people that are all in different instances since Bethy shamefully lacks a server list in 2019
---
i use the stealth boy mod on my x-01, with the standard lamp if i switched it on i would be detected, that doesn't happen with the tactical one.
---
also read others saying the same.
---
But some enemy types will detected you whatever you do, like Sb's, but i think the stealth boy and the tactical even makes it a bit better on those  :)
---
Handmade is best in slot. I've used Combat rifle with single &amp; auto receivers which a double/exp weapon. I had better success with a 2 shot handmade. As for replacing everything with a lever I'm all for it however, if you really like auto it won't beat a auto handmade. 
---
My alt currently RP's a cowboy so I don't use anything other than a lever action TSE. 
---
Yeah last time I got frog legs it wasn't lettin me cook for which I why I asked 
---
Fire caps are so hard to find hot damn.
---
I play pa4 my is drag565on
---
Watching Vendor Bot Phoenix just take on the Watoga security is a thing of beauty.
---
I used to be a hunting rifle with .308 strictly user but have since switched out to lever with .45 and find it much better.
---
M.O.D.U.S. Terminals as far as I’m aware.
---
Hey dude sorry I know it's older post but which perks help with learning new mods?
---
SHIET
---
But that's where my caps are stored!
---
&gt; Gta online sucked with the greifing. 
---
no matter how foolproof the PvP system, there will be people who find a way to grief. they need a mechanism to make griefing unattractive. How, is beyond me- just about anything I can think of can be griefed itself. Like 3 reports of griefing makes someone perma-flag PvP with a severe health/damage debuff. the griefers will just band together in threes and report their victim before attacking.
---
They need GM's that can watch invisible when a griefer is reported, then suspend/strip/ban that account as appropriate.
---
Your wife is a small child?  Nice painting though.
---
Yeah, unfortunately it does not offer any 45° positioning. I too like the concrete walls more, but as you pointed out they are budget intensive. These wall panels are a bit less so and double as the perfect placements for defensive turrets. Have fun fortifying friend!
---
vampire costume and the camo combat paint ..these were all earned while playing i think i have 530 atoms right now..not sure what else i want
---
Funny how in previous fall outs we had that... uhm ah nah... Karma system.... that let you be a bad person and once you pissed off a town you pretty much couldnt go back....
---
With PvP in this game i honestly wish they would go with what they did in neocron. 
---
**They should make it so that once you enable PvP the only way to turn it off is to delete the character.**  
---
**NO flip flopping and NO Taking over camps unless you have it enabled.**
---
You want to PvP, fine its all or nothing.... 
---
Great idea man. I’ll definitely visit. 
---
Oh man, that's fantastic! Ill give it a try
---
its hilarious when the fights spill out in a crowded place like whitesprings clubhouse and some randoms end up in the middle of it and are just confused as hell. ive seena  few people take crossfire and then end up hopping in lmao
---
Heck yes I didn’t think of dessert 
---
check online fore the code unless you want to hunt down officers who drop them and decifer the codes
---
I have played over 200 hours. I'm over level 90. I fast travel to Line in the Sand event, and it says repair the sonic thing. The sonic thing is sitting there with half of its health. It doesn't need repaired, but I need to repair it to complete the quest. So great the first thing I try to do today is a bug.
---
The vault that became NCR hasn't even opened yet in California so that means NCR doesn't yet exist.
---
&gt;They want to grief, not be griefed.
---
**DING DING DING** *We have a winner!*
---
Well I’ve got plenty of mutfruit and corn, so think of all the sides/ treats we could offer!
---
This. 
---
If I remember right, they're like 4000 from modus. 
---
Remove the explosive effect from weapons and give us an option to craft ammo like Fallout New Vegas. The following types of ammo can be added and each would have their own effect and downsides. 
---
A few examples:
---
Rifles and ballistic heavy weapons:
---
* Explosive rounds
---
* Armor piercing
---
* Hollow points
---
* Pulse rounds 
---
* Incendiary rounds
---
Shotguns:
---
* Slugs
---
* Flechette
---
* Dragons Breath 
---
* Pulse slug 
---
* Coin shot (we have useless dollar bills but no coins.) 
---
[yup.](https://imgur.com/a/BRkwVfZ) 
---
Amazing! Thank you!
---
Since it's not obvious I didn't dupe anything and don't even know how - and I don't care, I'm comfortable with the weapons I'm looting myself.
---
Looks like dupers have MILLIONS of these weps and sometimes just drop hundred of them in random container like the desk in Uranium Fever entrances - exactly what happened to me.
---
My god, reddit people....
---
Weapon Artisan, I think. It's on intelligence.
---
It was discovered fairly recently that it fixes the damage of the very fast melee weapons like the chainsaw, ripper, Mr. Handy buzzsaw (or whatever it's called) albeit only while it's in the 100-200% repair status. Once it falls below 100% it goes back to the broken low damage.
---
I hate when I get some stupid 10 cap wanted level for picking a toolbox I didn’t realize was part of a camp.  
---
I wish you could just go up to the person you “stole” from or got the bounty from and just pay them to caps to get rid of it.  
---
It’s annoying as hell that I have to die before it goes away. 
---
Thanks. Good to know
---
Since the setting is in the US, it makes sense for it to be a 12 hour clock. But, indicating AM or PM is pretty necessary in that case.
---
me too! definitely holding off on doing workshops until...my timing improves?
---
I’m definitely gonna remember your name once I’m done constructing my BBQ place and I’ll see what other sides I can find 
---
Could be worse; yesterday I got a Gamma Gun with extra damage to ghouls...
---
Way more expensive. With a Charisma of 3/ hard Bargain 3/ and grape mentats the Serum
---
Was 3600 caps. 
---
The recipes are around 23000
---
Just a heads up the green hood removes all items from your face, including facial hair
---
Yea, I’d look into Endurance anyways. It just might not be HIS play style but I kinda like no rads from eating/drinking. 
---
Got 3x calibrated  shocks and a jetpack in 150ish jumps, I believe its pure rng,but that's just my 2 cents.
---
I'm a 2h build, but I'm recently using a knife. It can probably stab a few times before you can swing a 2h.
---
I'll take a Brahmin brisket with baebecue sauce and order of radstag tips and tato fries and a extra large nuka cola to go.
---
Sounds to me like the devs couldn’t code to prevent the 20 year old Y2K bug
---
No no no the shiet goes on the matress to make a bed, that then increses wealth
---
My sneak is maxed out and the only way they spot me is if I shoot them and not move from my spot. I can walk around right in front of them and stay in caution. What kind of armor are you using? I'm mostly using leather armor.
---
I’ve got a giant farm going to get adhesive from veg starch and nothing (other than corn soup ‘cause it’s op) to do with the leftovers so hit me up lol.
---
Nice story, glad it turned out in your favour, normally doesn't with 2 PA peeps. The chinese sword was enough to beat their asses, what is the damage on that?
---
I had a bunch of PA asses take dirt tack from me, destroy everything I build, then leave. They didn't even want it.
---
At this point, the only thing putting me above 600 is legendaries that are too good to drop/vendor but I can’t immediately use.  If there were a disenchanting and enchanting system, or SOMETHING to do with middle of the road legendaries, I probably wouldn’t need more than 600.  Well maybe nuke materials, but 800 could be a max for a long time IMO
---
Yea dude I totally get that. Its a shame they went that direction. 
---
A ton of people say that it was a good concept and terrible execution but it honestly feels the opposite. I *get* that they want the world to feel barren like it *should* be after an apocalypse... but getting rid of a ton of potential NPCs and dialogue options really crippled the game. The holotapes and terminals are great though. Whoever worked on those did fantastic, its just a shame that they couldn't work on actual characters. 
---
The robots at whitespring are not lootable. I see the loot for a split second then it all disappears.
---
Also a healthy portion of salt.
---
Are nukes back up? 
---
And last week I used 50 nuke cards and nuked many many different areas with my cousin. Nothing was really good at all. Morgantown was just a whitesprings with less ghouls and not centralized. Everything else felt....empty. 
---
Great map, but I agree: weapons benches, etc would make it AMAZING. 
---
This is crap
---
For long range? I didn’t know the lever action had a long range scope. Although I notice the animation bug from Fallout 4 is still there...
---
Also I've bought the Santa PA skin, Vault Tec leather skin, and sparkler picture pose. Have almost 1600 atoms left, don't really think there's a problem with prices and definitely not how many points they give you. It will get even better when they fix the bugged challenges
---
Ok I’ll pre Ofer your meal for you 
---
Excavator Armor &gt; Pick Axe
---
Can you not wear it as a guy?? They let guy characters wear dresses and whatnot..
---
I’ll try, thank you!
---
Not yet that I know of. Did you nuke the capital?
---
Awesome I’ll definitely will thanks so much 
---
A few times when i couldn't get to my bag i have shoot at it or at the stuff that covers it, on time my bag was under a SB, gave it a few shoots and there it was :)
---
Just drop ammo you don’t use :(
---
They're trying to account for the big -19 switch over. Those TPS reports take forever to finish.
---
Odds are to much coding for all the variants that exist, so laziness, or as we say in chat, Be.. thes... da.......
---
The interloper and his cultists, mutant raid, mothman temple, moleminer horde, literally anything would be cool that isn't flying bats.
---
&gt; The bugs are hit and miss.
---
How can a bug be a 'hit'?
---
Go figure. So you I cant even wear the gas mask with it? Laaaame. They need to fix that shit, like how the hooded rags remove ALL your armor instead of going over like a regular outfit.
---
I have a few duplicated items on me and I have no idea how it happened. Only thing I know is that I couldn't drop them , use them or sell them. 
---
I would actually like those things to be removed from my inventory.
---
At first i thought this game was shit and in some aspects it is but i started playing it and really enjoy it. 
---
The gameplay for most part is very enjoyable and addictive. the community as of now is by far the best i have seen, people are most of the time helpfull and kind. 
---
The game have flaws there is no denying that but the amount of shit it gets is undeserved. 
---
I strongly believe this game gets progressifly &lt;-- butchered the fuck out of that, better and in a few  weeks or months i believe we will have a great functioning game with Loads of content. 
---
Hopefully bethesda stays positief and keep building  in this already very fun game.
---
Nah for the short-medium. I don't really both long range anymore. Most times with long range you end up getting a mob chasing you and up resorting to a shot gun or something more substantial.
---
I have a TSE Handmade that I use for large groups (like nuked whitesprings) I use it more for med range semi-rapid fire combat. I prefer to not use a scope on it, just sights as I think its better suited for that. But I am looking to get hold of a decent lever action to see if that makes a decent sniper rifle but I've not vested much time into that yet... Not even sure how to get plans for it TBH.  
---
I need to be able to craft a shitload of them and then scrap them all so I can learn all the mods like I have for the Hunting Rifle. Same with Hand Made I suppose as I don't have many of those broken down since I down own the plans yet as I'm too high level to get them from a vendor and haven't leveled an alt to 15 or whatever it needs to be to find it...   
---
So for now I guess my goals are to get the plans for lever action and handmade and see what all I can do with them so I can mod out a decent sniper version of one of those until Bethesda finally puts Hunting Rifles into the pool for Legendary status...  
---
I just love all the mod options that the Hunting Rifle has and wish I could get a nice Instigating version of it with increased scoped damage and faster reload time... 
---
You can upgrade them, actually. It's in the Craft menu at a weapons station, and you get 25/35/45 options using the original item.
---
I am on xbox! I am level 19 so that is perfect. My account is RL11322. Thank you!
---
Not that I know of. Did you nuke the capital?  The DMV quest spawned countless ghouls, but I assume they don’t glow because they are inside. 
---
People don't like CAMPS eh? The downvotes are flying.
---
For the most part, yes. Certain locations can spawn a variety of pieces and some can only spawn partial suits. 
---
it's in the Genetics Lab in the Science Wing (which also has a little 'light board' for the different enemies/monsters by 'grouping' which depicts the wendigo as being under ghouls) and are 4k base, or 3.6kish with Hard Bargain rank 1
---
&gt; said they'd fix the lever-action rifle,
---
This seems such a tiny issue, why does it bother people so much?
---
Explain how pvp functions. I never engage bc I don’t know what will kill me or how quickly. 
---
Oh I know the answer to this one. I can borrow it from the guys defending this game at launch.
---
Ahem. The game is supposed to have PvP and if you don't like it then tough. It was advertised in the game so stop hating on a game for being exactly as advertised.
---
I suspect it's easier to patch out than you think.  They could add the vendor inventories to the stuff that is tracked and maintained per-character, like looted containers and such.
---
Do that, set them to refresh when you visit every X hours, and provide a way to spend caps to refresh the list immediately.  Probably increase the forced refresh cost each time you use it before a natural refresh happens.
---
You went from "ban people no questions asked" to "the game can remove the item from the player's inventory without banning" 
---
With how buggy this fucking game is, you'd be banning people who aren't intentionally causing problems.
---
I don't duplicate, but I've had my power armor replicated twice due to crashes, and almost every time I move my base, I end with twice as much stuff.
---
That's the game's fault not mine. And you want to ban people for it. Fuck off. 
---
I have an main that's 112 that uses PA and 2 Handed weapon that is actually one handed while in PA.
---
All my previous fallout experiences I disliked PA. I used it once in Fallout 3, and never again.
---
So I went forth righting the wrong and re-rolling an alt Cowboy to save Appalachia.
---
Here's the build:
---

---
As for overall DPS output this isn't really a peak build just a survivalist that won't be using PA. 
---
I use a deathclaw gauntlet and TSE lever. Armor is Vanguard/Unyielding with any reduction weights.  
---
The problem I think, is the amount of resources they have as in Developers versus other bigger issues.
---
Sounds good!
---
Don't repair unless you have the required materials. Same with workshops and CAMP. Don't build unless you have the materials. In a workshop if it's green it's not your materials. If it's white it's using your materials, and if you don't have enough it'll use your mods. Have a good stash of the materials you use.
---
Wait wait wait... You're telling me there's pacifism in GTA 5 Online? 
---
Im thinking about grabbing the Sea Captains Hat myself. I collect 1 of just about every cosmetic i find, though ive only seen that hat for purchase. I was wearing the cop hat and skull bandana for a while, but i switched the hat to the Enclave Officer hat.
---
Fair enough. Once I started using silenced weapons though and maxed out sneak, I had a lot fewer surprise encounters of the up-close kind.
---
Im not reading that entire list but here are some things I would like changed:
---
1. Plans/Recipes we already know shouldn't be available at vendors and such. Also, the ones we already should not be rewarded as quest completion rewards. An unlearned one should be rewarded instead.
---
2. Vendors should have their own caps. All the raider vendors shouldnt be tied together, all the responder vendors shouldnt be tied together, and so on...All vendors should have their own caps (and it really doesnt even need to be more than 200 caps, 200 is fine, having factions connect vendors is not, at all). There are 22 vendors (including Grahm and the vendor by the Charlestown Station pond I havent seen yet) in FO76 and yet, we can only go to 7 of them to sell from because of the stupid faction connections. Thats BS.
---
3. The screenshots you take while playing Fallout 76 should be available to craft as pictures you can place in your CAMP.
---
4. Stash size should be much higher. Between having enough resources for repairs to my CAMP, PA, weapons and armor along with the weight of weapons and armor, that is a lot of weight try and fit into a 600 pound limit. Im not even doing the quests that reward unique weapons or items because I have nowhere to put them. Not to mention, legendary farming is useless to me because even if I do get something really good, I have to give it to a friend cuz I cant keep it and I dont want it to leave my group at least. STASH NEEDS TO BE INCREASED BY A LOT!!!!!!!!!!
---
Make sure your game is in full screen mode vs borderless window mode. I have a 1080TI and was experiencing issues, that turned out to be the culprit 
---
yes - if you don't have a certain junk part when repairing or crafting but it's in a mod, it'll scrap your mod to use the junk from it... there is nothing that can stop this from happening right now. Just be very careful when modding, crafting, repairing because it'll show you what it's pulling the junk from. 
---
Well, let's talk about this then! I agree :)  
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/308952/why-other-power-armors-don-t-have-any-set-bonus-ability-like-excavator-pa?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/308952/why-other-power-armors-don-t-have-any-set-bonus-ability-like-excavator-pa?language%5B%5D=en)
---
The lever rifle also makes a great sniper. The only real advantage the hunting rifle has over other rifles is the ability to make it a 50cal. The 50cal ammo is very materials efficient to make. 
---
Why is everyone hung up about human NPCs?  Robot NPCs serve the same damn purpose.  Being the last humans gives the need for survival and player co-op some purpose.
---
Yea it’s weird not sure why it does that. I can post a pic later
---
I know as soon as I do I will find a dope weapon that uses it 
---
Yeah.  Sorta makes other players like ghosts.
---
Grafton, Eastern Regional Penitentiary , Grafton Dam, Grafton Steel, all those place have Super Mutants that won't go super high levels whenever there's a high level nearby
---
So the excavator Power Armour shows that it obtains more ore if you have both the left and right arms on it but I don't know how to initiate it. Mind helping me out?
---
Through testing, I found that I yield the same amount with or without the Power Armour (which is 1.)
---
After that I figured that I would have more tries on ores instead of obtaining 2 but most times, I'm only able to mine one time before the ore depletes.
---
I guess my question is... *How do I get more ore with Excavator Armour?*
---
Been looking for the real raiders ever since I started. I have a group that's slowly coming together.. I've been in a couple raider gang wars and sometimes it's just lil ol me vs 3 PA assholes. That's fine, I hold my own but damn my base has been destroyed 3 days in a row now, I need a loyal group who wants to fuck shit up. How bout mine and yours join forces? Wipe all the others out of our Appalachia..
---
Sadly this does not change the location that your friends and team mates spawn on your camp.
---
it only changes where you spawn when you go home
---
Friend/Team location is tied to the initial location your CAMP was set down.
---
So now my team spawns under the floor at my camp.
---
I used to be a HUGE fan of Lead Belly until I swapped it out for Sunkissed (6am to 6pm, remove RAD damage over time). You can run with only one level of the card to counteract every piece of RAD-laced food you eat. Two is overkill for most scenarios, but I run it to remove all of my acquired RADs (even outside of food), and now I don’t use RadAway unless in a nuke zone.
---
In the Bonus XP section you didn't mention Cranberry Relish, it's 10% xp bonus for 1 hour and gives 200 AP  
---
requires 2 Cranberries (not diseased) and 2 Gourds 
---
I agree with you wholeheartedly. The whole "Break it Early" BS was just marketing. How arrogant do you have to be as a developer to have a 1 month long beta test and then force release? We are currently Alpha Testing or Very Early Beta testing the game, Fallout 76 wasn't even close to being ready for release.
---
That being said, there are many of us that love the game enough to want to try and help fix it before it self destructs, which is the goal of this post. I will say, that personally, I will never pre-order another video game... I thought I had learned my lesson, but it is what it is.
---
Anyone looking to buy lvl 35 eXcavator PA? Upgraded my one so I have a spare cheers! 
---
Looked great until I saw the scorchbeast and tried to stealth at work. 
---
I dont really like crits, that is a good idea tho
---
Thanks for your input
---
I feel like people just wanted this to be another Star Wars Battlefront 2 where gamers could rise up as one against the injustice of a big corporation. When it wasn’t as bad, people made up false stories to hurt the games reputation and farm views.
---
I’ve played this game well over 200 hours and have more than gotten my money’s worth. I’m excited to play it again when I get home from work. 
---
I love Fallout. 
---
I want the officer's BOS uniform.  You know, [the black one.](http://i.imgur.com/gvxbhpu.png)  I'd fork over some of my atoms for that!
---
There is already a way to do that in the game.
---
Open the map, click on the person messaging you (either in the map or in the list on the right), choose "Send Message."
---
&gt; You just go up to a river and mash the collect button.
---
The radiation penalty is a bit insane as well. I am dipping a bottle in the river, why do I have to get a full radiation bar from doing that a few times? It is worse than if you swam in that same river for a half hour.
---
I like the disease mechanism. I mean, I hate it with a raging passion, but it is proper, and gives you incentive not to just max out lead belly and suck every glowing puddle you pass.
---
Nope, you get an actual number in the hud out of PA, no number while inside. Without PA I also always wear a gas mask for -2 perception, and I always get the numbers appear.
---
I like the tool weapons like pickaxe and wrench. It looks right with Excavator armor. Maybe I can get some legendaries one day.
---
ive been dumping these in starter friendly areas when i collect to much i just want to know if they stay in the containers if i leave the server
---
It was actually the excavator armour that made me realise this. At first I though that it would make sense I could mine stuff without the pickaxe in excavator armour since it has drill hands or whatever so I stashed my pick and tried mining.
---
It was only then for the first time that I thought that maybe it would be possible to mine with no pickaxe at all. I tried it and... it worked. Biggest oof I've had in gaming for a long time.
---
I could have swore i read if you have no mic or its muted you cant hear anyone. 
---
Personal observations.. without PA on amount of ore retrieved was minimal and not worth it.  
---
Lucky Hole for example.. Each vein of lead I can pull 4 or more out of it.
---
literally every weapon in the game has a Legendary version... Legendary Walking Cane??? Legendary Sickle??? Really no one uses these weapons other than scorched... Its like they had a checklist and checked every item in there and they just missed or double clicked the Hunting Rifle. It's a weapon that has the same legendary modifiers as any other weapon has... It shouldn't take much to fix this...
---
I won’t be on until later tonight, I’ll send you a message, they are lvl 30 and 40 respectively so you won’t be able to use them for a bit but you’ll have them ready to go when you hit those levels.
---
One-shotting in all of its forms is kind of dumb, except maybe snipers
---
For some reason i read this as jones bbq, and thought part of the restaurant would be a spa. Lol  mind always goes to memes! 
---
Nice trick, I will try that one.
---
Its an interesting and long read. I agree with you though. At the time TES was strong and FO was floundering. Shifting FO3 was a smart decision
---
I can make you ultracite calibrated shocks. Come find me with \[ Adhesive 17, Aluminum 17, Fibreglass 6, Ultracite 9, Violet Flux 5 \] per leg and bring the legs and your Ultracite PA wont be a garage queen no more.
---
it rains in my house... 
---
really?  I had no idea.
---
Bring me any and all SWG features.  I'll be happy.
---
It’s a bug. They are aware and have a planned hot fix. 
---
Weapon/armor renaming would solve this.
---
Off other bodies yes, a container.. Don't think so
---
wait whaaat? so t-60s the easiest to maintain?
---
I started building my camp by water. Even if it is a puddle. 
---
Hay memes first then survival 
---
oh lord please no.   im already only carrying 4 inadequate weapons as it is.  
---
I sold my ultracite. Don’t hate. I didn’t want it. But is there a way to re name the chassis or see what’s on it before placing it?
---
Could be that the "drop rate" takes a bit longer than expected. When I was farming mutations, my last mutation (carnivore) took me around 15x of standing next to radio active barrels and using the decontamination chamber before I finally got it. Maybe you have the same issue, i hope at least.
---
Give it a whirl at a place that has a decont-shower and maybe you will get it in a few tries.
---
Yeah I may have to do that.
---
at least once per day i store all of my junk in my stash and then take a little bit of everything, in case of instances like this
---
I want to nuke Harpers Ferry and Wavy Willards Water Park :)
---
This is a great map, and I know this has been said, but please consider adding workbenches (weapons, armor, etc.) Locating a place to scrap items without going back/rebuilding my CAMP has been one of the most frustrating parts of the game so far. 
---
My #1 cuplrit is repairing during events. 
---
&gt;I initially thought this said "chairs".
---
&gt;*I was so excited to make a dance-floor with chairs stacked to the side like the high-school gym.*
---
I thought the same thing my dude.
---
Someone above says drink, then spam the collect while the animation runs for the same effect.
---
Because memorable unique npc with a standout personality love or hate makes the game itself more memorable . It's not really a survival game other then u eat drink ..
---
I keep getting Legendary Tire irons LOL. Fuck my life
---
Yep I'm hoping it is bad luck and not impossible to get now 
---
Update on this. Managed to find a blaster myself just now. Repairs to 200%. No change it damage :(
---
&gt;Jet Pack - 1%
---
oof
---
I know to fix that they have to fast travel to you not your camp. But my friends almost never come to my camp so what do I care as long as when I go which is wayyyy more often I don't spawn underwater. I wish it did fix friends spawn points also that would be nice. 
---
The thing I don't understand is that the exception the author carves out for why New Vegas is awesome is the exact way I look at Fallout 76.  In 76, I am an observer, not an instigator.  If I wish, I can play detective and figure out what happened in this world.  If I don't want to launch a nuke, guess what, I don't have to.  I can, as the author says, "let whatever is going to happen happen."
---
I don't see how that's somehow more true in New Vegas.
---
Is there a recipe for ionized meat?
---
Maybe quest items, as they lack the "learn" command... I check misc by weight time to time, so far I never found those. And I think I explored all the map.
---
antique in style not in age lol
---
Did you ever die from rads and it popped up saying you got it?
---
That will lock you out till you clear the dud mutation.
---
If a serum doesn't work then you got it via that method
---
What evidence is there that dupes cause server crashes? I’ve seen non on the subject. 
---
And “destroy the economy”? What economy? There *isn’t* a player driven economy in FO 76
---
But seriously, this specific controversy was flat-out dumb. Bethesda nor the bottle company advertised the Rum as having a glass bottle, the bottle looked obviously fake (as in, not made of glass) in the promo shots, and making that type of bottle with glass would be hugely impractical in real life due to the awkward design. So I find it stupid that people bought this and surprise-surprise, the bottle isn't glass. Despite them never saying the bottle was glass in the first place. 
---
Yeah, interior enemies are not affected by the nukes. I tried that area and it was poo. 
---
Exactly what I’m saying. It sucks and I want a different way
---
Next time I'll just do a "trade" for zero caps. Though I'm sure that's glitchy too
---
Valid. Thank you for trying to pump this knowledge to the masses. 
---
I'm sure I know what you're talking about but I couldn't tell you which.
---
We'll know when Bethesda sends the Fallout Classics out to us all I guess. I can't wait to die in the tutorial all over again when I forget you have to manually set the timer on explosives.
---
I just moved my camp here over the weekend with my balcony overlooking the are you mentioned. I wasnt certain if it was a silo but i was hoping i would get a nice show one of these days!
---
I think a recipe that includes a way to purify- like charcoal as an ingredient, would be appropriate here. 
---
You can go into the relevant crafting/cooking station and check if you have it.
---
The bug is planned to be hotfix today if possible. 
---
OP the game is good to play now. There is a big update coming this month. 
---
&gt; Plans/Recipes we already know shouldn't be available at vendors and such. Also, the ones we already should not be rewarded as quest completion rewards. An unlearned one should be rewarded instead.
---
Some people would like to buy plans for friends.
---
I've noticed the same thing. Super annoying. :/
---
Harper's ferry isn't all that different if you're already high level, just a bunch of level 68 mutants. I only did willards once, but again, it wasn't too different. 
---
True, I’m on a pa4 Pro and have noticed crashes and bugs, which does make the game unenjoyable
---
Is there a way to rename?
---
I'll give this a check! 
---
actually changing from a hardened barrel to a 50 cal barrel lowers the dmg output on a hunting rifle so I see no reason to change to 50 cal on it... which makes zero sense but in Bethesda's world increasing the bullet size vs strengthening the barrel is a downgrade...  
---
The countdown from 100 starts at 100,  but higher perception makes it pop up on your mini map sooner than the countdown. 
---
Forgot about that one since there's no way in hell I'm even considering carrying a 20-25+ lb that uses 6 lb ammo while I'm already forced to use too many weight reduction perks as is.
---
I was stressing the rads in the beginning, keeping enough rad-away was a problem.Then I learned about diluted meds, and it was a game changer.
---
That's the one!
---
you are most likely scrapping them once all of your wood scraps have been used
---
Hmmm.  Rifleman vats build here.   I stopped picking up fusion cores cause i barley go through mine.  
---
Nice. I never even gave that a second thought. 
---
Ever heard of The Beatles?
---
You can unlock plans to build them too. 
---
CONGRATULATIONS! It isn't really a jackpot if it doesn't also award you a G.A.S. Prize Certificate at the same time, though...
---
Drop the knowledge on how to find recipes or mods for T60/T45. Are they event based? I have 3 character, 45/121/89 and I've found literally 3 shocks across all the characters. 
---
&gt; same issue here too, it let me dig it the first time, but not for the other 3 copies of that map i have for Toxic Valley #03 
---
sounds like a fix for all the dupers using maps, its based on level and if you only get 1 per character thats pretty sweet justice. 
---
You try balancing bullet physics when you live in a world where 10 bobby pins is 1lb!
---
This may be it! I've died several times during the process. Time to clear and start again maybe &gt;&lt;
---
just gran 1 point in tenderizer than since it's only 1% after the first level
---
I just think pacifists should be allowed to take the area. That's a pvp event. Defending and thing workshops. Let then explore those areas don't let them take the work shop 
---
There’s green houses in I believe Lewisburg.. so why they’re not available to us with planting pots / plots I’ll never know.
---
Yep, that's the one I've been looking for.  I don't like to mine in the dark.  I guess I could put a different head on it, but I have a fetish for wearing a full set.
---
start a bit up creek and go downwards, pretty sure i got more than 5, i was using green thumb, don't remember how that is calculated, but ended up with 24 Radshields on my last run, need some more when  Bethesda has got a new shipment of nukes :D ...
---
Do you use PA?
---
Adrenal Reaction alone shoots my damage way way up. With just Adrenal reaction at 19-20% hp my level 45 black powder rifle does 497. Keep in mind I do have a Rifleman build, this means I have all the rifleman perk cards maxed and tank killer maxed. I do not run any sort of sneak play style built into my build at all. With level 1 nerd rage, the same black powder rifle with the same perk cards on, does 546 damage. It's a nice enough increase for me to enjoy it. Now I just leveled my Nerd Rage to level 2, and now my damage with the same gun and cards has gone up to 571. 
---
Agreed. How am I supposed to be a raider if my Mad Max style villa is surrounded by chicken wire?
---
Get the INT perk card "Power User", rank 1 lower core drain by 30%.  Only cost 1 int to use it.  I keep it on all of the time, and share it with my groups.
---
I collect more cores than I ever use, even sprinting and jet packing every where.
---
Bethesda needs to have other locations spawn more creatures/legendaries to encourage more diverse use of nukes. 
---
Depends on the receiver. Just as there are several .308 receivers there are several 50cal receiver. 
---
Yup.  I use it once in a while.  
---
Pvp at high level for me is who can fire their explosive shotgun first. I miss lower level fights.
---
I was like that around 40 also. I was like "Is this all there is?" To keep it fresh and enjoyable I had to look at it from a different angle.  Balancing stash,food,water,materials,ammo,CAMP....it's all stuff I have to manage as soon as I log in. I spend about an hour just getting myself prepped before exploring. I explore most of the game. New places,new faces,new enemies and possibly a quest I didn't know about. I take a whack at the main quest now about once a week. The game is just to enjoyable I dont want it to be "over".  So I'm giving it a lot of "foreplay" and not blowing my load all at once. The possibility of an enemy ragdolling in the air after I shoot or grenade them is just icing on the cake. Shit makes me LOL every time.  
---
I mean, if it was added.
---
ah so that's why  i was using so much more than my friend
---
So you(we) can use machine guns but how dare a scorchbeast machine gun us? 
---
There is a ton of plastic at wotoga high, cafeteria has a ton of plastic cutlery, and the middle school where vault seee takes you, auditorium has a ton of plastic pumkins. Also bulking messes me up, I just dont do it because then I dont have a good baring on a total of anything I have, also bulking is bugged for a lot of items. 
---
Max dps build is something like Bloodied powerfist or deathclaw gauntlet + Adrenal Reaction + Nerd Rage + Radicool + 5x Unyielding armor.
---
One arm movement away from a dab
---
Nice shot!
---
I had ghouls the one time it worked. This event bugs out sometimes. The past week I tried playing three times and two of them were bugged. The event was set up south of Watoga, but trying to fast travel to it was very high cost and wouldn't work, and trying to go to the location didn't start the event.
---
Wait a second. Is that how the vendor works? Another player buying it before you can removes it from the buying option?
---
I thought RNG threw up a unique random list for every player even if they are checking the same vendor and it does not affect another players available items. 
---
Thanks! I have maxed out gladiator perks and STR, as well as maxed out AP perks and AGI. So I was literally running circles around these guys. I don't have the game in front of me, but I know that the Chinese sword does more than the mole miner gauntlet (for me, at this point)... basically a frag grenade per swing. I'm sure I could do a lot more damage with a heavier melee weapon, but I prefer speed over strength.
---
I wanted to scrap everything before I left so the bastards wouldn't get it after I was gone, but I decided to leave it with like 30 turrets just so someone else could stumble upon it and wonder what the hell happened there.
---
My level 16 alt buys them in Watoga. Usually have to served hop at least a dozen times. Why Bethesda went with Diablo 3 launch style loot percentages is beyond me. People are going to served hop until they get it - just make vendors sell everything. 
---
Watch the material screen. It will tell u if its using a mod for materials.  
---
But the fact it does this is so idiotic.  Ive paid 400 caps for 2 steel scaps in the past.  So stupid.  
---
I had a legit TS Gauss Rifle (no exploding) and I accidentally sold it in an almost-comedic escapade involving being stuck in a vendor screen and trying to get out of it so I could let people use it instead while I was on an unexpected emergency work phone call.  It's too easy to double-tap on an Xbox Elite controller sometimes. :( 
---
Still pissed at myself over that one.
---
Ah well as a shotgun/rifle build I don’t need them so i drop them off on new guys and watch them ponder their existence over how to get all of them back to camp...funniest damn thing 
---
The game doesn't really stop anyone from doing just that, so why not? I can fuck with people and say I'm roleplaying as a raider. Would that make it better? Raider's fuck with people for fun.
---
I'll give you fifty real world caps for it.  
---
It should increase 1 level every 2 weeks, just to mess with the dupers.
---
You don't have to world hop.
---
Whoa. Did not know that. 
---
Not sure why your response got removed, probably for cussing at me, but with my solution, stuff wouldn't even duplicate from crashing or from moving your base anymore anyways as it would have to check with the server for the item ID's.  You act like I'm making this up as I go, but this is how most major online games do this and they don't have issues. 
---
Sorry, since I am a solo player, I generally just go to a train station or to the whitesprings crafting room and drop them for others to pick up later.
---
You don’t only get one, just in a normal playthrough I have about 3-4 of some maps while only having one of others.
---
At least that will give you something to go after!  That’s the hardest part as you approach endgame imo: having compelling goals and things you want to do that feel worth doing 
---
More of a never ending machine gun and less ground combat
---
&gt; i guess you just dig deeper :)
---
*Ends up in communist China*
---
Which then means metric assloads of diluted stimpacks. :)
---
Same, I'm level 81, with almot 200hrs in the game and still enjoy stumbling across the random encounters, or trying to peice together the stories at all the places I 'passed by' to get more fast travel points without propperly exploring.
---
This does very well what most post apoc games should, tell the story with the environment and what you can peice together yourself, and not spoon feed it to you for have skill x at rank y.
---
Also: I really wish people would stop saying there aren't NPC, there are, Rose, Modus, Grahm, Prize Bot, the fuggin Census Taker, all of them are NPC, they just aren't human/ghoul npc
---
This is awesome!

I saw someone staking out a workshop I had last night, they attacked and killed me, but then I respawned, killed them back and hopped servers. I have no real interest in PvP but I'll take my shots back and GTFO. Lost the workshop but the funny part is that after one more defense, I was going to just give it to them if they were still around.
---
That's what I've done too lol hated pulling out excavator armor before a fight, painted my ultracite armor to tell the difference 
---
Not a bug. A whole set of ultracite is given at the end of a questline, x-01 must be crafted on your own. 
---
Its like a mini boss for that area, they drop more items than a normal mob of that type. and have a chance at better loot.
---
There is also an alpha type that spawns mobs around it until the alpha is killed, I forget if they are crowned or just have the alpha tag.
---
It's a placement issue. Move the workstation to another location.
---
Indeed, if you’re an assload sort of person
---
You could be right - I just assumed it to be the case. I have not verified my assumption. 
---
According to the guide, they're situational. X-01 has better energy and radiation resistance, Ultracite has better physical resistance. You're suppoused to take whichever one is best suited for what you're doing.
---
Every costume item is worth picking up. Even the lowest item would go for at least 1 cap, that is 1 cap at a weight of 0.10lb. Which is equivalent to 10 caps per 1lb, which is still very efficient.
---
The best part.. get the SB involved that lives in the City
---
To further compound on the hunt for PA mods specifically X-01. Is that painting your PA (any for that matter) shouldn't destroy your current mods placed. Having to redo all the mods because of that sweet looking Blackbird paint (or whichever paint). I eventually gave up on the server hopping for a 2nd set a date went with T-60 which took literally no time to complete as opposed to the X-01.
---
That's always a bummer. But it will get right soon. If we can all live through the great "Kill Evan" fiasco we can live through temporary glitches. BTW I like yur username. :)
---
It appears to be pretty random.  Personally, I have picked mine up from locked safes and looting the crowned mobs I kill.
---
You're currently in the problem level range. Everything in the 15 to 30 was a pain for all three of my characters. If you don't have friends or gear that can be transferred your in for a show. You'll be gambling on trying to find new gear. I ended up keeping the same armor and weapon for a while during my first play through. The pipe weapons weren't kicking it when I got to Rosa. Ended up encountering higher level robots and a deathclaw..... Those encounters were trash with my peashooter 
---
Yes please 
---
Update: The planned timing for the hotfix to go out for all platforms is 2:30pm ET. The game will be taken offline while the hotfix is applied. Thanks again for all your help in getting info on this issue. 
---
The idea is to horde them until you have all 76 before scrapping, no need to gather all 76 in a single sitting
---
 **significantly weaker** ?
---
DMG is higher and rad resist a bit lower...
---
PvP is my favorite part, and I agree with everything you said. It needs to be well balanced. I enjoy the bounty system, but the person with the bounty is at a massive disadvantage, especially to players like me who can stealth kill you in one shot from so far away. I'm just excited for the dedicated PvP servers. That way it'll all be transparent. But yes, VATS needs to be adjusted so it doesn't target non enemies. 
---
Wait, what? What does a pick axe have to do with anything?  Don't you just walk up to it and hit the action button?
---
I did see online that fixed some of the problems, but this happens with crafting stations away from my camp, as well as at my camp. 
---
Thank you for the advice.
---
Yes.  Farm in my excavator and nukes with my t60 
---
oh you mean like these?  
---
[https://imgur.com/a/1qwQLjm](https://imgur.com/a/1qwQLjm)
---
Ass security?!
---
It’s kinda random. Most my encounters have been in the mire tho
---
Hi Blue, 
---
Can you described your legendary farming technique in Watoga. 
---
Did you not complete Mayor for the day quest line to be able to do that?
---
I’ve seen bots switched like that, but never anything else. 
---
I'm ceetain they turned nukes off for the new year's players event at the whitespring so no trolls could bomb it, but then fucked up turning them back on somehow.
---
I’ve ran into it by my camp right next to Charleston fire department but my best guess is Abbie’s bunker
---
I've heard tales of these explosive weapons you speak of, but I have yet to Google or attempt to find them myself. I really don't even want to PvP. I just want to be a junk farmer with a cool house. I'm kinda worried getting OP weapons will make the game too easy.
---
You can sell the excess pretty well, but you get 2-3 times more healing from the diluted stimpacks since you make 4-6 at only half strength. If you use power armor, I recommend converting most (but not all; you need full stimpacks to revive teammates) to diluted just to enjoy the extra heals.
---
If you don't run out armor as much, having to spend twice as much time locked in animation and not in the fight is less than ideal.
---
This would also make it really easy to destroy someone’s base then pay off my own bounty without them ever dealing with me.
---
Thank you! Might take up some of those vendors on my regular route, appreciate the reply!
---
ok no one uses the blunderbuss and unless you cannot get a legendary Gatling laser then you can just make a legendary gatling laser into an ultracite version of it by adding a prime capacitor to it... I know very little of the gatling lasers so maybe there isn't a prime capacitor for it like the other prime receiver/capacitor plans. I have a ton of prime plans on my character to I'll look to see if I have a prime gatling laser capacitor plan. 
---
Fps drops are pretty much exclusively caused by your computers hardware, not by your connection.
---
Granted this game does suffer from rare instances of framedrops when loading in new cells.
---
(i think this happens about once or twice in my average 8~ hours gaming sessions)
---
Also when you encounter other players that have bad connections this can cause lag for you as well, but this mostly manifests in teleporting players and mobs standing still, not in fps drops.
---
Aside from these occasional server issues i have a very smooth experience, with constant 75fps and no framedrops.
---
I am running a very high end PC and 200mb internet though.
---
What kind of pc are you running the game on or is it the console version?
---
Also, make sure you are not on WIFI, this game really hates lost packets, something that happens quite often on WIFI.
---
There are a few more you can get from tech data:
---
You could do the grafton parade event it spawns for that and it's really common .
---
Is it just me or does the marine helmet not fit at all in looks for the armor?
---
For the first 10 levels or so, my female character ran around in bra and panties with leather armor. The chest piece was pocketed and it covered up quite a bit of skin, leaving just enough to make it all look sexy-like.
---
Nowhere in particular. Completely random. Seem him in the Bog a couple of times and the mire.
---
Looking good!
---
May I ask what you used to create the app?
---
If you pay off your own bounty it goes to the victim of you accidental lawn chair assault, it’s a good idea. 
---
Yes it does but if it were a regular occurence we could be conservative with what we place for users. Dont have to dump all of them in one go. 
---
There is usually a single plant, a planter, across the street from Silva homestead.
---
Lever action all the way.   Quadammo 1* is amazing.   No crazy dmg buff but ill take the 20ammo over 5 anytime.  
---
Thank you! I'll keep checking him, sadly the only half decent thing I've found on him was a .50 receiver for a hunting rifle and it's not even that good compared to hardened .308
---
I’ve naturally received 70 supers from the game that I have yet to touch since beta
---
If they do that, the game dies. It will be an absolute contradiction of everything they promised about the game from announcement day forward. They might have fucked up several things but they haven't \*lied\* about anything outright yet. (The bags don't count, since that probably \*was\* out of their control until they second-sourced it to make good later. And since it's taking as much as 6 months to get the bags when that's literally all they're sourcing, it seems much more likely that it was something they couldn't help in  time for launch.) 
---
LOL that is that little restaurant/station where 3 mutants normally arm and they attack that thing.
---
"However, after relogging it now shows the effects in my stats. "
---
That explains that. I only checked like once when I unlocked the thing.
---
Also the guide says the veil should protect against environment hazards but I'm pretty certain that doesn't work.
---
I think it's a decent idea, something like Skyrim did. But maybe depending on why you have a bounty or a certain cap count you wouldn't be able to pay?
---
just killed that lil bastard in the mire last night... pretty sure its some kind of alien
---
That sounds pretty funny.
---
Knowing our luck they do that and totally F's up something else lol
---
It uses number 3 maps from other zones. You probably had 5 #3 maps from another section (probably savage divide) and it used them up to dig.
---
It's exactly what happened to me when i was treasure hunting all my stock piled maps.
---
Then you know...
---
cool , world of Warcraft is waiting to hold your hand on an adventure in the finest cultivated taste in online gaming. Who cares about an economy- you don't need to buy or sell anything from anyone. make your own shit buy and sell from vendors. you can kill scorched beasts and queens with just a moded fire axe you craft yourself and x01 you craft yourself. the economy is broken by streamers and meta-junkies who have a sheep mentality and think TSE- handmade/shotgun and whatever mutation is the only viable way to success which it's not. Whatever man, go play fortnite or final fantasy online - this game isn't for you. Is for me and a lot of other people sorry you don't get it or it frustrates you but like I said your triple A gaming experience is calling with Madmax or whatever...
---
 X01 has higher radiation resistance Ultracite has better physical defense, depends on your taste and style not much different otherwise. Same mods essentially. 
---
Everything is Metal, right now, a mix of Heavy, &amp; Sturdy, Polished, Alloyed, &amp; Enameled, some are shadowed.
---
I am still testing the different Armors, but the best DR I have seen is on the Polished Metal, I have a Chest Piece with 117 DR, but I have also been considering switching to Marine armor for the Deep Pocketed (+10 Carry) advantage.
---
If I look on the bright side I always gain a mutation.
---
I recommend Camden Park. They seem to have a lot of Excavator mods. It's where I found my second Excavator shocks.
---
still waiting on my camp budget fix 😑
---
i came across a camp in the mire yesterday, right on the road by the galleria, that must have had at least 40 turrets. I thought that was impressive...
---
they're rare? I've discarded/broken down at least three of these if not more O.o
---
Its random. Ive only seen him twice. Once at the Whitespring Golf Course, just out in the open on one of the greens. And the other was in the trees on the cliff over looking West Tek Research...My friend killed him both times, jerk.
---
Ballistic fiber if I’m right can be found at military sites. Like check inside tanks and such the like. 
---
Adhesive you can farm with 2 corn 2 Tato and 2 mud fruit 
---
If you cannot get it using the Rads way, I can give you a Serum if you are on PS4. I have 2 Serums left.
---
Still a God.....The mighty Poo
---
All I'm hearing is "I have 1,050 caps stored in heavy as syringes."
---
As a heads up All Night Long doesn't reduce your meter depletion rate, rather it lessens the penalties for them being low empty 
---
&gt;Since it's not obvious I didn't dupe anything and don't even know how - and I don't care, I'm comfortable with the weapons I'm looting myself.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Looks like dupers have MILLIONS of these weps and sometimes just drop hundred of them in random container like the desk in Uranium Fever entrances - exactly what happened to me.  
---
&gt;My god, reddit people...
---
Repurposing an old adhesive factory to agriculture?
---
Looks like you and I have same percentages on seeing calibrated shocks anywhere
---
HA!
---
I power leveled 2 characters at WS.... I loved it when I got those level 63 adds LOL. 
---
However, that was after leveling a first character, using dungeon &amp; dragons perk builder, and having materials to be able to farm there.
---
Phasing sucks in WOW and I really hope they don't implement something like that in Fallout76.
---
I feel there needs to be these types of experiences because it helps players feel that HARSH apocalyptic slap of messed up reality.
---
After the grind and few legendaries  that experience is lost. Like on both my 121 and 89 after 45 the game is quite easy with decent gear.
---
I'm at work atm, but I'd gladly buy one! I'll message you later
---
Don’t know what you’re getting at but ok
---
You are not the great mighty poo..
---
Wait...so you have to actually find the mods?  You can't just create them once you have a given skill level? omfg
---
I just sell them. They weigh too much to save, especially since I never use them.
---
15 caps each at Max charisma, so 70 yields about enough to buy a serum from a player trying to recoup their investment in the mutation recipe, or some plans or something useful.
---
No need to be an ass
---
As early as 3, as I personally don't remember 1 and 2 so much (thankfully getting them soon because of Bethesda), you couldn't necessarily max out every stat to 100 but you can get pretty damn close and you're limited to X amount of Perks out of a large pool but these Perks mattered WAY more in 3 and NV as they impacted your character so much more than in FO4 and FO76.
---
 FO4 just had the special stats you can dump points into and the perks you can equally dump into which eventually made you a literal god being able to do everything and anything with no repercussion. Your build quite literally doesn't matter in the geand scheme of it all because everyone ends up at the same place anyway, maxed out and overpowered. 
---
FO76 NOW allows us to respec our character every level past 50...but only for a singular point allocation. Meaning I would have to sacrifice one point in a stat to gain one in another and only once per level up. If you're like me and just kinda went 10/10/10/6/3/10/10 or some shit like that then it will take forever to fully respec your character to an "optimal" build of some sort and you will STILL have glaring shortcomings. Again, this is perfect for everyone finding their own unique "Role" in this "Role-Playing Game".
---
Excavator you say?
---
I’ve only seen it twice. Once was halfway between 76 and Flatwoods, and the other was by Abby’s Bunker. 
---
The mods seem to be specifically gated to the card you need. If a mod requires science master you only need that card and you don’t need the subsequent cards to craft. So if you put on science master and you need a lower card to craft a mod you wouldn’t be able to until you equip the card specifically listed for that mod.
---
There is a prime receiver for the ultracite gatling laser which is different and is made different than the standard gatling laser. Ultracite laser pistols have a legendary though.  So the point is the hunting rifle is not the only separately made gun that does not have a legendary in game.   
---
primed Gatling laser does not equal a primed ultracite gatling laser.
---
I am just trying to understand what the thinking was n creating the current system. Was it to promote trading, was it to eventually sell plans and mods?  How it works now is silly. I spent days looking for brick walls. It an appearance item. It should be in stock everywhere all the time. I get weapons and armor stuff being rare, but camp stuff?  Makes no sense. 
---
&gt; It cost over 2X what it would have if we would have simply cast a glass mold.  
---
Except that they said it would have been cheaper to make it out of glass. 
---
You're a real human bean Denny
---
The silo cooldown times are stuck and people can't launch nukes anymore.
---
I don't think there's been any official explanation on why this happened.  Some think Bethesda intentionally shut them down for New Years Eve festivities and screwed up re-enabling them.  Some think it was literally a Y2K kind of thing.
---
Chameleon armor and specializing in VATS/CRITS will help with your Sniper build.  You'll have to avoid PA to maximize damage so being able to sneak well really helps.
---
I think you mean vendor bot Phoenix 
---
&gt;mutant behemoth
---
You are not suppose to let a  mutant behemoth get that close to you, you should down it first... :)
---
Camo PA paint (love this and it goes on every type of PA), light wood floors, racecar bed, 76 hat.  All of these were gameplay Atoms, I refuse to "pay" at the current prices.
---
Well I haven’t even done the DMV or brotherhood missions yet, so I’m down.
---
The garbage part of your idea isn't having unique items IDs. That's fine.
---
In the original comment I replied to you said you wanted to "instantly ban" people that have items with the same id. That's what I take issue with. 
---
You have now changed your stance.
---
It's honestly a fantastic source of income and once I've sold out all the vendor caps, I can sell to other players.
---
Right the point was for a damage test 
---
Counter Bag o' Plans club represent
---
Bethesda got what they deserved for the technical aspects of the game; terrible performance for a game that is hardly pushing graphical boundaries, tons of severe bugs, many that can negate hours of play (and with no option to load a save game to mitigate them)... And don't get me started on that PR nightmare they just kept making worse with the canvas bag thing.
---
On the other hand, the shit they're getting for the basic game design is not warranted. Before the game was announced, when it leaked, I knew precisely what kind of game this'd be, and turns out it's pretty fun as a game of that type. People who weren't listening and believed this would be just like New Vegas but with multiplayer being salty fucks gave this game a worse rep than it deserves.
---
For Lead best is to set your camp up next to a lead deposit, there are quite a few of them. Also collect every toy you can find, the paint on the toys have lead. Also Military grade Duck tape has ballistic fibre, I think anything with military in the name has ballistic fibre ... make sure you tag it in your inventory so it isn't missed.
---
Charleston FD has it but is looted most of the time, also there is a motel in flat woods with a gym which has it, I rarely have a problem finding lead but also mine it at my camp. Also a lot of robots carry lead scraps.
---
 its an MMO. I have hundreds of hours, 2 chars and I have only built a not bad crafter so far. My fighter is parked until that's done and I'll use the knowledge gained to do a better job on him.
---
 My Jenny Jones can make a lot of stuff and actually fights really well, but is balanced towards crafting.
---
This is the boat I’m in even though I was told about the armor while doing the quest the first time myself. I so badly wanted to see it but was only level 25 when I got it. Dropped the chassis anyway and ended up having to walk to the Watoga Station over encumbered while barely surviving. 
---
I would never pay for a guide, let alone one that has so many mistakes. It's no good as game guide if it's inaccurate. 
---
Only if they call if the Lemmy
---
I appreciate your reply. I've been to Camp McClintock a 100 times and have never seen a Soldier Certificate that can be picked up. Maybe a difference between PC and Xbox. I was thinking of creating a low level character to get another certificate, and then hand it to a buddy, then log back in with my main to get it from my buddy.
---
I think it may scale them back if you have a bunch. I have a pile of them because they were hella common but I rarely see one per day now if even that.
---
white springs... find a ledge (out the golf course lodge small door. there is a ledge u just whack at them from)
---
also you die/respawn super close and just repeat.
---
I swapped out gunsmith 3 for power user 3.  I over repair my gun to 200%.  No luck of the draw either.  Repair once a day.  Easy.  :)
---
Came here to say this. I had this problem exactly with marsupial. I cleared everything and was able to get it my next try once I avoided dying.
---
Woah, I haven’t played this game since they nerfed xp, and this is still a thing?
---
I tough they would have fixed that a while ago...
---
Just joking, sorry :)
---
That's the Grafton Monster, not the Flatwoods Monster.
---
I loved Rose's quests, and her radio station. Raider Dash for life. I am with you, I really hope we get more content from her in the future patches.
---
Alright, thankyou so much.
---
There seems to be a respawn portion too. I was in Harper's Ferry over the weekend clearing out the Super Mutants and they were all level 20-35 (i was level 32). as i make my way through the town, searching the buildings and heading toward the church i hear gunshots in the distance so i open the map and there is a level 140+ running around. all of a sudden all of the super mutants i had killed, plus the ones left alive, were all level 68. 
---
Barn Door, Barn building and Advanced power connectors are all fixed, i just learned the door one last night.... probably had it in my inventory and went (i already know barn building)
---
I can confirm that he just dies after a while. Presumably to prevent farming him, since his inventory changes after relogging (when you have a friend who keeps him from despawning). 
---
Alright, since I got marked down one I guess I can provide more context. There is a mod on nexus mods that can change the radio. In fact there are several. One adds a DJ. That said, it's a mod and there is banning going on from them. That is what I meant. Hopefully this long form explanation assists people with this. Just keep in mind it's a mod and Beth is being ban twitchy ass hats. 
---
I should have clarified that the camp of the person whose shop you are trying to reach may have been blocked by someone else's camp, if their camp is at a popular location, and thus inaccessible. Meaning people who want their shop to be up each time every time will be "all over the damn place" to avoid this issue. 
---
Might want to list your platform.
---
 I know I’m just trying to get to the bottom of this because I really like ultracite it’s just too weak for me 
---
This is reddit my fren. All of our ideas are hadnon the toilet.
---
For we are *all* pooping.
---
&gt;Alright, i sent a friend request
---
The 50 cal is there for people like me that play crit builds, base damage lowers slightly for increased crit damage
---
Hehe yeah I have a Furious Assaultron Blade that doesn't do as much damage as the Chinese officer sword, but looks way cooler with my space-suit eyebot-helm combo. So I guess I sometimes sacrifice damage for fashion as well. Also I don't know where I found it, but I had a "Chinese sword serrated blade" mod sitting around in my stash forever when I found the sword. So I lucked out in that regard because I don't have the original plan for it, but was still able to get the bonus damage.
---
Hi, do you still have a tse handmade?
---
I haven't changed my stance.  It has been the same stance just explained more because I figured most people would've known what I was talking about since A LOT of games have this. 
---
Which even is that? Never know about that 
---
My understanding is that cores are used from:
---
 \- VATS
---
\- Sprinting
---
\- Power attacks
---
anything else?
---
no, its just toxic valley #3 that has that issue; if i get additional maps for other sites, they allow multiple digs.  however many are having this issues with this particular one.
---
it looks cool, but doesn't match what I would expect it to look like.
---
my favorite combo is the medical visor/gas mask as seen in my first screenshot here:
---
https://imgur.com/a/DG1WCz4
---
on that same page the next screenshot is my character with the helmet is question.  Looks like its too froggish or alien like to me
---
Sounds like a classic rollback. 
---
This is true.
---
Any sort of direction from the bunker?
---
The fire breathers quest puts the anti scorched receivers in there as items also 
---
Destroying a base is a whole lot more than 50 caps, unless you do it really slow but at that point you should rethink your life decisions.
---
Exactly, once you get Chemist and Super Duper you'll be swimming in diluted stims, radaway, and rad-x. Joining the Enclave also helps since they have readily available decontamination arches.
---
I like your story except for the four paragraphs about how you had to convince yourself to PvP. This is the fucking apocalypse. As soon as you see a player in red on your screen you need to take them the fuck down, time for talking has passed. 
---
200 IQ
---
Legendaries regenerate once when under 50% HP. Fully intended, no bug.
---
Honestly same. I was at my base and I just got this loud unfamiliar noise and it startled me pretty hard. It was my first time finding Grahm though so I got super excited after. 
---
"Plan: Metal Bed" this is the one you need to hoard. 
---
oh nice, Ok I will check it out.
---
I just wanted to add that you should be able to stack food with bonuses to INT and bonus XP, as that is too separate things. Though, the result is higher XP earned for anything.
---
Why does INT/XP gain bonuses not effect XP earned from events/missions/etc?
---
Nah man Legendary mobs always do this if they are able to, that is, if you don’t kill them fast enough. 
---
[.jpg](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Y0qk55jUKhk/maxresdefault.jpg)
---
But the T-60 doesn't have the weight bonus of the excavator.
---
Also, with Power Patcher perk, its trivial to repair all of the power armor with minimal junk.
---
Xcode was used on a Mac PC.
---
Nope, just gotta have a second chassis
---
I'll be on in a bit
---
Well, if they can't ban dupers, they really need to get rid of the two- shot explosive legendary effect. 
---
It's only supposed to have a 1/1000 chance of dropping, but thanks to dupers. every fucking time I go the Uranium fever event trying to farm legendaries, some asshole is one- shot killing everything before anyone else has a chance to get a hit in which means that they get nothing. 
---
It's really getting out of hand. 
---
If it went to the person whose stuff you destroyed, maybe.  I just have a feeling that griefers aren't necessarily strapped for caps, and/or that caps may not really matter to the victim either in light of the work involved rebuilding whatever they broke.  Not being able to get out of a bounty, on the other hand, is an actual gameplay inconvenience.  You can't go about playing the game as you normally do when you have a bounty on your head.
---
I have used both my X-01 and Ultracite when fighting the queen, haven't really noticed any difference, would have guess it's only pure math, the game should just use the DMG resist points in its calculation... but who knows :/
---
If you nuke harpers, make sure you get big b’s rest stop in the circle. Seems like at least one legendary super mutant will continue to spawn in there, harpers on the other hand was very hit or miss.
---
New Appalachian Central Train yard, if i remembered it correctly 
---
I know that its a bad comparison
---
Just walk into grafton near the top of the map under the waterpark a little and you can trigger an even about a parade , the end of it has the monster . After that there's another even called protest march but that never works for me so I just leave . 
---
For the base recipe, for the mods you have to have the item you learned the mod for.... what was the gun this mod went to again...
---
Posted this months ago and got like 5 upvotes. Nice job 😂
---
I hated Rose's quests. In fact, she was so annoying on my main character I stopped doing them. I still haven't finished the main quest on any of my characters.
---
I built a camp next to watoga station on my main character. 
---
3.5/10 never doing it again lol
---
In FO4 I think the weight of the armor itself factored into sneak. Might want to try testing light weight mods. I don't think I use shadowed on anything and I put deep pocketed on all my pieces. When I can get on later I'll take a pic of my perks and armor pieces, maybe something will stand out.
---
Nuked the water park my first time. Lots of plants to collect and mirelurk queens in the toxic valley, but it doesn't really change the park much. Was disappointed.
---
Level 25 is a bit of a dead spot, tbh. No Enforcer, no Tank Killer, no Bloody Mess. Probably no legendaries because you're poor. Every time you go near the Savage Divide you get your ass kicked because the enemies are scaled up to a nearby level 150 player. Best you can do with a ranged build is take a couple of levels in Sneak and play very carefully.
---
The weapons aren't really the problem. Combat shotguns are strong. Hunting rifles have the best long-range damage per shot at that level. Lever rifles fire about twice as fast but you won't have the mods.
---
You can only have 1 of each piece, 1 left leg, 1 right leg etc.
---
Also don't store more than 1 fusion core in a chassis even if it lets you, you will lose them all except 1.
---
Part of what you are running into (I believe) was a patch a little while back to deter server hopping for materials.
---
Yea insane amounts
---
O wow oops sorry guys I read the question wrong ... my bad 
---
Not on the same chassis, no. You would need to pick up a separate one and keep one of them on you in inventory. The upside is each chassis only weighs 10 lbs when not deployed, even with a full suit on it.

The date resets everytime you launch the game.  It have a feeling it maxes out and disconnects after a certain amount of days, I seems to disconnect after a certain amount of hours of continuous play (around 8ish hours shamefully  lol, I am setting a timer when I log on today, hopefully if I don't get booted by a duper crashing my server I will get to the bit again where the game actually boots you and gives that weird message).
---
It still makes absolutely no fucking sense that you cannot use purified water in a recipe that required boiled water. There is absolutely no realistic difference. 
---
Did you sell your calibrated shocks yet?
---
47 with Hard Bargain 3 and 8 Charisma.
---
This is a game changer!
---
what makes the ultracite gat laser different from the regular gat laser? I thought it was just an ammo thing... and yes I get ur point that it's "not the only one"  but its probably the most prominent gun in the game and can be picked up at lvl 1 and still picked up off level 76 Super Mutants. It is so persistent throughout the game and SHOULD have a Legendary version well before the ultracite gat laser or the never used blunderbuss or pipe revolver... It should have a legendary version moreso than 90% of the weapons no one uses because there are better options... No one uses a walking cane or the ski sword or military sword. Does anyone even use plasma weapons? I never see them ever... 
---
You're q good man. Blessed by rnjesus
---
The only way to stop exploiters is private servers wth active admins. Bethesda can't be bothered to police their own game. 
---
Yeah, I stopped reading after maybe the second section for that reason, too. While some of these are good ideas, others are debatable, and some are ones I'd personally prefer not be done - like the suggested change to corpses to have them disappear once looted - if anything, I'd maybe prefer they stay longer.
---
And under reloading? Lever action rifles are already planned to have the animation broken up with an upcoming patch, and black powder weapons? I don't use them much at all, but I honestly wouldn't be at all surprised if the reloading in-game is actually *faster* than what would be realistic.
---
This, Thank you.  
---
it doesnt stretch out, it still stays center making the edges look really wonky.
---
along with 21:9, I would love for the fonts to not be stretched and looking weird too!
---
Normally if it is too close to the wall it does this, but you might have another issue. If you have it outside your house, does it still do it ? Might be a bug. What are you wearing, maybe strip down and see if it makes a difference.
---
I had the same issue but by me it duplicated the t60 and and like 4 Power Armor chassis 
---
Confirmed - I use my pickaxe to mine ghouls instead!
---
Out of an orange colored purple sky
---
All asaultrons can drop it and it's pretty common. Like the buzzsaw
---
Just replied to my post, but for visibility's sake, this hotfix is intended to go out on or around 2:30pm ET. 
---
Lmao the game has barely been out and you're saying it's very obvious? Same shit was said in Ark. There's gonna be a massive banwave and we're going to see so many people crying. Claiming that "their friends gave them the stuff" and they didn't know. It's gonna be great.
---
Yeah.  I can get behind the whole concept of the Scorchbeast being this big, scary thing that makes you change your plans, but the sonar attack just feels broken, particularly when you're making every effort to get away as opposed to fighting it.
---
Watoga High and Red Rocket Mega Stop my dude. I have over 10k Shotgun Shells now. :)
---
They aren’t really worth it imo. Flamethrowers in general are severely underpowered and getting a lot of fuel for them is nigh impossible. The bunker buster is a little better but is useless unless you dedicate your whole build to missile launchers
---
T-60 is the Honda Civic of power armor.
---
This is too funny ..
---
The new year borked the silos.
---
Unavailable right now. Bethesda has said they hope to have a fix out today.
---
Till then though I would farm keycards.
---
PS4 Pro. As soon as I get into a server it freezes and disconnects me. Happened three times now, going for four...worked this time.
---
Might have something to do with spawning me u der the map, underwater every time I log in.
---
I wish I did this. After I eventually won the factory, my defend quest was against three scorchbeasts. It became not worth it very fast.
---
i didn't indeed. I didn't have the game until about 3 weeks into it. 
---
And plenty of new people seems to be around after Christmas, so they probably didn't either. 
---
Which excludes quite a lot of people. Hardly everyone, then.
---
But this is a brand new code base, its not like they took fallout 4 and added.... oh wait....
---
Can finally check if in game chat works now I know someone who has a mic. Not had a single person including in BETA so started thinking it could be me. 
---
Thanks, didn’t know that. Was wondering how it was in my inventory if it was unowned. 
---
I thought it was one of mine as I have a habit of claiming random sets I find. 
---
Still Not sure how my armour duplicated or why it wouldn’t let me place it down when claimed though... 
---
Was hoping it was a ban hammer. 
---
Damn six hours!? Well done...
---
I don't get why you can't.  Since there's a finite amount of caps we get from vendors every 20 hours, what difference would it make if we could just sell ammo like pretty much any other item?  
---
I'd love to be able to sell duplicate plans/recipes as well.
---
Would take the sting out of buying one you already learned.
---
Ignore them as best as you can. They’re boring horrible and take the fun out of everything
---
Laminate floors are my favorite Camp purchase.
---
I would not have survived my 100+ hours of Fallout 4 without the "More Where That Came From" radio mod. I'm one who personally prefers Inon's music, but when that eventually gets old, I turn the radio on. When that gets old, I feel like it's time to stop playing.
---
I get 48 with Hard Bargain 3 and 9 Charisma, and an even 50 with grape mentats as well,
---
 methinks there is a solid 25% cap on reselling to vendors
---
i was unaware that bullet caliber had anything to do with anything let alone crits in this game... how does the 50 cal change the crit dmg vs a higher base damage...
---
All heavy weapons are as the name implies pretty fucking heavy but with bear arms they weight almost nothing
---
Most asked for change since launch
---
Me too 
---
This list is awesome! Didn't see this on the list, but heavy weapons that use cores, like fusion or plasma are bugged. When first switch to they are loaded with ammo equal to amount or cores in your inventory, not the proper amount per core. Drives me nuts to switch to my Plasma Gatling have 42 shots instead of the proper amount left in the core.
---
Weird. oh well, at least I have a spare set of power armour now! 
---
I will be looking for YOU 
---
How about the spot where behemoths spawn?
---
He probably had an explosive gun and killed himself after trying to grief you a second time; looks like karma was well deserved. You made the right call logging out, he would have gotten even more toxic had you stayed.
---
I’ve done gc a few times with randoms, and it’s always worked for me.
---
After I hit about level 40 or so I started seeing turrets at the MkV+ level, and I believe most of them shoot explosive rounds.  I think it's just a level based thing.
---
Uh ty then :)
---
This was posted by FloorBelow on here about a month ago

I'd put extra points into Perception and use Glow Sight (or at least swap the 1 star CF for a 1 star GS).
---
Awesome, thanks so much Jess!
---
You have and you're now backpedalling. 
---
There's one near a substation in the bog, and if the power plant is fixed you can siphon off the power from the substation. I personally like up north near the crashed space station there is a place with a junk and a lead extractor you can have within the bounds of the camp. 
---
Chally likes green stuff and carries lots of things.
---
In the right rockets csn be useful.
---
I use a shotgun/explosive build, with a TSE pump for mooks, and a two shot missile launcher with a targeting computer for far away targets.
---
Play around a bit and see what you can do.
---
Oh wow. Thanks for the tip! I'll definitely have to use that trick.
---
Its a pvp event.. participants chase and shoot whoever is wearing the mask.  Were you wearing the mask?  Then, when you weren't wearing the mask, he probably shot at you with an exploding legendary weapon and blew himself up.
---
Yup! It almost always sets me on fire!  The excavator armor is a ball &amp; chain for me right now cause the carry boost. But that's a whole other story lolololol
---
Is it level dependent to keep the turrets as formidable enemies?
---
Don't restart. Once you hit 50 you can just start moving special points if you really want to change. Once you get to 60+ you will basically have every perk card you want no matter what you choose now
---
&gt; Won’t happen if it’s content from the game Bethesda don’t speak of.
---
Why do people keep saying this. Every time they're asked about it in interviews, Bethesda is very positive about New Vegas. There are multiple references to New Vegas in Fallout 4, more in its' DLC, and several gameplay elements like equipment modding or the faction war storyline were clearly inspired by New Vegas. 
---
Bethesda isn't jealous of Obsidian for "showing them up" because a) they recognize that different studios have different design philosophies, b) New Vegas still made them boatloads of money, and c) they're *not children.* 
---
As in plural?  I only know of one spot with one Behemoth. Is there a spot where multiple spawn?
---
Yeah just give me a bit, I got really specific with where he went and still need to go through the screenshots and plot it all on some good basemap. I make maps for a living so I'm hoping to make one more aesthetically pleasing and specific than scribbling on the ingame map in Paint.
---
He mostly followed roads but he did randomly wander off of them a few times.
---
I'm also going to follow him any time I see him again, so I will have to keep updating it. 
---
Barbarian and strong back aren’t very good for a power armor heavy weapons build. You could max out the heavy gunner perks instead. I’d say to restart if you don’t feel like getting to 24 will be a grind 
---
That part I'm not sure, but make sure you never drop a chassis you want to keep because it's fair game for anyone to grab. Always place
---
Thank you guys so much! If any of y’all wanna party up( if you have PS4) my username is shatteredknucles
---
As I am someone who is generally RP'ing in my mind, you're absolutely right. I need to stop applying my real world morality to the wasteland. This first encounter with some raider jerks has kinda opened my eyes to the potential of the whole PvP experience. Now I just hope the next time it happens it isn't two high levels in power armor.
---
Simplest description is "anything that drains AP also drains the core". 
---
If they hit you enough times, they'll explode when you kill them and you can't loot them.
---
Noticed this last night, about 50% explode into a bloody mist and disappear.
---
&gt; Dupers get instantly banned for having duped items with the same ID's
---
My stance on this has not changed.  Your reading comprehension needs to be checked. 
---
T-60 is life.
---
At the bottom of the screen while you're crafting it tells you the effect of whatever mod you're about to put on the gun, 50 cal says it gives superior crit damage. I dont k ow the exact number but I do know my crits do massive damage even with a non legendary rifle 
---
From yesterday
---
Yes, but there's no Hardened .50 cal receiver. Going by the wiki, it looks like there is a Precise .50 Receiver, which gives +10 to damage, but that still doesn't match the normal Hardened Receiver, which gives +12.
---
At least you got your order, I've yet to receive a tracking number for mine.... Not like I want it anymore or anything 
---
That’s what I do with my boyfriend. It can be glitchy. I’ve traded him mini nukes and food/water where it disappeared from my inventory it didn’t show in his. 
---
Did blocking even work, they can still shoot you even if you block them, they just can't see you on the map. I agree, it should be 100% passive mode, let's hope it is coming because it should be a thing.
---
Did they do a lot of damage. I had two douche bags show up at my camp and start shooting it up. They tried to shoot me and kept changing weapons, I just kept healing myself and eventually they left. Probably didn't have shotguns ..
---
Ahhh alright I kind of figured that. Not sure how I feel about it though hahaha
---
I used the excavator too and thought I’d use it for ever but then I got ultracita t51 and same I thought it’s my power armor that looks good and excavator for the carrying capacity. But yesterday I got my prototype x01 I upgraded it with calibrated shocks (I think) and now I can carry the same amount that I could with excavator. And it looks better then ultracite. 
---
Yes, this is happening on all platforms, not just PS4. "Better with friends, except you can't find your friends."
---
So it sounds like i have wasted my cps on mods! Took awhile before i noticed and all the good ones are gone. Maybe i will just start a mule and put them there, seems like the only safe place.
---
Thanks everyone
---
Keep an eye on the Inside the Vault updates.  This one from yesterday offers some high-level details: [https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/5te3GDsV1eOM2YOKoyWoI6/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-1-2019)
---
Such as:
---
* New quests and weekly events.
---
* New PvP mode.
---
* Having the other Vaults opening up.
---
* Player vendors.
---
Yea maybe bethesda should nerf how often they can use the sonar attack like by a few extra seconds between each burst
---
Yeah, it's weird, half the targets don't glow at all.  Legendaries stop glowing once they regenerate.
---
I don’t know if it’s possible tbh. Bethesda has all the rights to most of this music and uses some rare versions of songs for their game 
---
Weird, it's working for me. Just three more to go!
---
Wew.
---
Whitesprings will once again feel my wrath 
---
there's also a run down trailer in the mire east of the generals steak house and north of Robco that has a patch of 3 gourds close to the phosphate deposit.
---
Had the same thing happen with a witches hat, but was eventually able to get rid of it.
---
Apparently the solution is for many users here is for Bethesda to just ban us. 
---
But... but... nukes are great farming (I live in my damn excavator)
---
So even if you have two ranks in the perk, you may need to get an unranked card to upgrade? That's ridiculous
---
thought the same. 
---
Not being a dick, I honestly don’t remember ever hearing this 
---
That sucks cause I need them to hit me for tick blood
---
Yeah it's not that big of a deal. Bugs happen and they are annoying but it's just the nature of software I guess. And I did get Evan the next day I tried hehe. Or maybe after some server hopping. But on the plus side I just got a mod I've been looking for for a while from Harpers Ferry so my annoyance has turned to relief to get that over with. And I like your name too. :)
---
Nah I'd be okay if it goes against camp budget like any other decoration if it's not in the stash. I don't want servers crashing because people want to show off their collection of 100 suits of power armor.
---
They put out an inside the vault blog yesterday with vague details on stuff coming up, but they haven't elaborated yet on the specifics.
---
I just use a exploding shotgun or TSE handmade even at range. Just a reflex sight (circle) on both. Hell with the shotgun if the reticle is within an inch of a max range target it’s dead.
---
The other part of this is that it becomes more and more painful to walk through the bunker to get to that merchant.
---
i think not realy importent to sell them BUT it would be cool to scrap them, for crafting new ammo that we need, example on the thinkerworkbanch: get 25-50% material back if you scrap the same amount of ammo you would craft, that would be nice and would give the ammo looting a meaning
---
I think it either means do less damage or make sure they don't suck blood.
---
If you provide the mats, I can craft you ExPA shocks. I learned the plan the other day. Hardest thing to obtain is 5 Violet Flux per shock needed.
---
I think it's random.
---
Sell a lot of other items to vendors like junk and glowing blood, probably why I have such a stock pile of them 
---
Why up north? There isnt much happening up there. Mine is near a farm between the amusement parks.
---
What entrance do you use, the fastest is the maintenance shed, run through communications at the bottom of the first stairs on the right through the arc takes you straight to the military wing, and run back and leave, it's faster than doing the door opening bs at the bunker entrance.
---
Good.
---
He looks like bacon.
---
I craft it and need to buy material for them. So I sell the parts pretty cheap its the mods that can drive the price up a little.
---
Hmm I don't remember it looking that blurry, it looks clean in his thread to me though.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9yza6w/i_made_a_map_of_resource_deposits/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
I think they’re doing both, it’s just that fixing the HUGE things takes more time, so they’re sprinkling smaller things at the same to let people know that listening 
---
The reason I say no on this, is not everyone is friendly to other people’s camps. Inviting an entire server to 1 persons camp could be disastrous for the camp owner if there is a camp destroying person in that server. 
---
I’ve had people show up at my camp just to destroy it with explosive weapons randomly. 
---
They're meant to do that once you hit a certain level. It's both annoying and nice to know that turrets don't become a minor nuisance in higher levels like they did in Fo4.
---
I got the platinum edition mostly for the extras and such. Plus the map info is nice (as in maps of actual areas, not just the big map of the world). Like potential spawn locations for plans and such seems accurate.
---
I personally wouldn't restart, but it's up to you. I would just move forward and fix it as you go along. Obviously a clean start would be easier. You could just work on a 2nd character and keep both characters that way it won't be wasted and you don't have to get rid of all you inventory. 
---
At level 50 you can change your perk points.
---
Okay I'll try that 
---
As soon as I posted this, I get a pop up, server maint at 14:30 EST. LOL.
---
It's definitely not immediately obvious. But I've been to the Ammo dump many times (Dane Compound &amp; Logging camp nearby are great for looting) and only recently have the turrets shot explosive rounds. 
---
So maybe it's RNG but higher level you are more likely they spawn different types? Just spitballing here
---
I believe the budget grows as you get higher level.  Also avoid turrets at all costs. 
---
Yea im physically mapping out the map lol so time it takes to walk run and sprint is long
---
I can only imagine how many nukes will occur within the two hours after they bring the game back online. Time to stock up on Radaway and Stimpacks. 
---
I actually had a science teacher who wrote in all caps every time 
---
Fo76map.com 
---
It's a highly interactive map with tons of information on it.  I love it!
---
That’s why I suggested a limit, something small where it’s less likely that you were bugging someone and more likely a stray bullet to a fence
---
Good call. I'll download from Reddit instead of Imgr
---
I ran in to him twice recently.  Once yesterday or the night before and the other this past weekend.  Both were in cranberry bog near one of those glades of weird psychedelic trees.  Maybe a hundred yards outside of the glade.
---
In FO4 NPCs could take stuff out of containers. The only way to stop them was by blocking access to the container physically.
---
Nope, just planted a stupid amount of crops.
---
I always kill the watoga assaultrons and I've only ever got electrified once, here i get one every time + you don't have to kill them so it's perfect for lower levels
---
i cant friend you on discord for some reason
---
The questline where you run between differt bunkes (Abbies Bunker, Blablas Bunker...etc) gives you the plans as reward. I think its the questline which leads to the brotherhood questline.
---
This is really nice +1
---
One cool suggestion would be in the settings there would be a holographic star over legendary enemy bodies and the hologram will represent the rarity of loot with the amount of stars
---
Random unfortunately, I get many of the same plans over and over, I wish it  would randomize the ones you don't have.
---
I think we should just be able to do something like break down x perk cards to get a perk pack (a few more than are in the pack for diminishing returns)
---
Like wise for OP, just quitting without posting about it would’ve been sufficient. The Reddit is for people who enjoy the game and I’m tired of it being filled with post like this or post that are just rants. It’s widely known the game isn’t perfect, we all experience issues but we enjoy the game nonetheless and want to see others who enjoy it and here about there experiences, not to read about why you left. 
---
They dont have to be all swollen for them to drop tick blood.
---
Tick blood just seems to be less weighted to drop as loot from them.
---
Hahah yeah exactly!
---
I used to carry 3, but now just 2: rifle and shotgun.  I used to carry a 10mm pistol "just in case" or to take out stuff much lower level, but I don't do that anymore.  Thanks for the advice on the bazaar.  I'll check that out.
---
i see. Yeah I don't play a crit build i just have my 3 rifle perks maxed. If I'm sniping I just use the crit bug to keep my crit meter filled all the time
---
Will you use a  TSE all the time?   
---
Your build seems to be min/max for damage, so I figured you'd want more max, and glowy things aren't uncommon. 
---
I have always just thought they were using stimpacks just like us ? never considered it a bug...
---
Being able to sell or scrap ammo would destroy the resource mechanic.    No reason to get materials if I could just turn shotgun shells into .45 shells.  
---
I'm just saying dude. People are a lot more likely to help when you act like a human being. That's all. That dude might have been way off base but he was just trying to help. It's easy to get frustrated at something and lash out at people. It's easy and weak. 
---
Just tested this, not the case. On one of my characters the rank 2 Science Master allows me to build rank 1 mods, on the other it allows me to build neither, as if I didn't have the card equipped
---
Hey that blackbird paint is based off the SR71, that's as damn patriotic as it gets.
---
Shooting his wings will make him land quicker
---
Wow amazing, great job!   
---
You build camp like this while I can't find a flat ground where set mine :D 
---
The server maint is to hotfix the broken nuke silos lol
---
personally my fav spot to nuke is the exact spot where my camp would be if someone else hadnt already put theirs there on 4/5 servers i log into. The spawns are awful n theres usually not much flora, but the personal satisfaction is off the charts.
---
Dont use turrets.
---
They is what will chew up your budget. Honestly they usually are not even needed on camps anyways.
---
Great guide for herbivores. Also the underground by the bog town, has fungus growing in the tunnels for veggie soup.
---
I would say, give a carnivore guide, but if you're mutated, good chance you know what meat you usually adventure on.
---
Again, great post for the herbivores out there.
---
I just want the system from fallout 4 back where you picked all the shit you wanted then could put your shit in to make the caps zero then finalized the transaction. Not this buy or sell one thing at a time crap.
---
[http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)
---
here ya go... not google doc but has all the effects 
---
&gt; Explain the use of the 2+ INT PA mod and what benifits it has. 
---
Only things I can think of is for scrapping and hacking, and both of those have greatly diminishing returns on investments (like you get ~+1% more scrap per point at 10+ int).
---
I said in a different comment that I think INT needs a complete rebalance when it comes to passive effects; it's the worst stat as far as passive bonuses go. Sure INT has some great perks locked behind it, but the same could be said of most stats (except the other stats still give you good passive effects).
---
It is basically random, unfortunately.
---
Yeah it sucks to play a game when your mindset is solely to level. Also, another tip for your future build is to not actively use any perk relating to crafting/repairing and use combat perks. Then you can swap out your combat perks for crafting perks when you actually craft. 
---
The main tip is the black titanium is in deposits in the town with moleminers down south west of the map. Look around that town. There's loads of deposits. The other big thing is springs and screws. There was a list of things that contain these parts on here somewhere. But to cut it short, highlight the part you need and then you'll know. The moleminers also carry scrap black titanium. Don't forget to use the 2 perk cards, armourer and Fix it good, you'll get double the endurance out of the suit.
---
If weapon weight is an issue look at what mods are on the weapons. Some only change stuff like bashing damage but weigh way more. There are little "required" mods most are preference. Having a suppressor is cool but if you shoot once for sneak damage and then run in its kind of wasted. silencers are dead weight in my opinion anyway. But thats just because 76 just has less space for sneak play in my opinion. You can sneak but it has barely any advantages and just slows you down.
---
It would be nice cause I am sick of tried of having the server responding error.
---
ahh, thanks for the info!
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L5c8ZKCCf4OaNglGc516dl9AFxYWnMUDuhQbHjrlQkQ/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
I dont know it just seems like there's gotta be a perk more beneficial than that
---
I'm thinking 1 point tenderizer and taking cola nut and good doggy, I'm still not sure tho
---
So your only dilemma is the new build has perks that are counter productive to your endgame build.
---
If you intend to use PA always Barbarian/Iron Clad is not needed. Blocker is not that needed since you won't be blocking with heavy weapons \*one's that use bullets\* If you plan on melee anything you'd use their respective perk cards.
---
I've used luck on the draw on my 121 and the perk doesn't proc enough to be worth the points. Items still break regardless of the Perk for Weapon or Perk for Armor. I tested both.
---
Also if possible only get crafting skills after 50. Once you cap you can just smash points from 50 to 80 to get all the crafting skills. 
---
Here's my build for my no PA and no Auto weapons:

---
As for restarting I've done it twice. Perk cards are level capped as you can see. Spending the time to level after 50 using a non-optimal build seemed tedious. Also since your BELOW 50 you'd have to continue to level and than after wards use points to re-allocate special points then buy the desired cards. I dislike having to do that so I just re-rolled. 
---
FYI I have 3 characters. 54/121/89 I'm no expert but I do have experience leveling multiple times. 
---
Son of a-- I was just about to log in a play for a couple of hours
---
Blood cleaner is that rare i found it in the same vendet 2 days in a row
---
I think it's the capitalization on the S and F. StaffinFraktion#8259. I always forget that matters
---
Wtf. Literally unplayable. Unrockable.
---
Some griefer took down my entire camp with an explosive shotty the other day. I just switched servers. It's like, way to make me click "repair all structures," guy.
---
I know that.  I'm just thinking about how something that like could still be gamed by someone with abnormal levels of patience.  Because, if it can, it will.
---
Nm. Saw you posted elsewhere in the thread. 
---
179. 
---
for maximum stealth and superior recoil. I'm also hoping it replaces that bloomin wire monstrosity!
---
&gt; but isn't something that can be patched out easily either
---
Is that a joke? Make them have a full, static inventory and—boom—patched out, simple as that. They just don't wanna do it to because they can't think of a better way to prop up the game economy than gating the most sought after vendor items behind this ridiculous RNG bullshit.

Lol. Yea.  Excavator for non nuke farming. 
---
T60 with 2x calibrated shocks and motion servos aint so bad on carry weight.  
---
yeah you can't server hop for materials, it knows you have been there, so it looks empty but only to you. You have to hit different locations.
---
A few other maps to help [search the wasteland ](http://www.falloutcounter.com/fallout76-maps/index.php) 
---
Maybe you only get them by scrapping 
---
Apologies for digging this month old comment up, but how do you survive the rads of a nuke zone?  Aside from radshield.  Do you use a hazmat suit?  Or legendary armor with the leaded modification?  Do you team up and use radsponge? 
---
I've been dreading trying a nuke zone as a solo low-health unarmed build.  I have 4 pieces of unyielding armor (varying levels and types due to rng), and don't know how effective I'd be if I had to use a hazmat suit.  I would rather avoid using radshield+X combo due to my mutations being suppressed, but do have radshield.  I can't do the radsponge thing as I'm solo.  I don't think ghoulish is as good as people say, since it only heals the rads you take.  But maybe for strictly nuke zones it'd be handy?  Holding off for better weapon, currently stuck with legendary level 50 knuckles with vampire and +40% swing speed.  I am currently level 59, slowly working my way through the cranberry Bog and brotherhood questline
---
You should watch Todd Howard at e3 video...
---
You and I both, friend. :') Guess I'll go take that nap I was thinking about earlier...
---
The non aggro flatwoods monster appears in the woods near the Landview lighthouse, usually before the mothman event. 
---
The only other time I ran into one you could fight was like in the north eastern end of map, in the mire
---
Good information, I can confirm that the Bog does drop T60 Plans and parts.  I run an unyielding set, wish I had thought about luck factoring in, I would have jumped out of my power armor.
---
Did you receive caps when you collected a treasure?
---
At the same time don’t place your armor when you disconnect or any other way to get out of the server. Found out the hard way you lose your armor if that happens.
---
Got the serum again and I'll also do the one handed and explosive weapons
---
&gt;c) they’re not children
---
If riot gear appears in 76 I’ll buy you a set. They will not add anything from new Vegas (note I’m not saying it has to be NCR riot gear as that’s not lore friendly to WV). However publicly amicable they are about it it’s gotta sting that objectively the best fallout wasn’t made by them.
---
Because legendary Wood armor exists
---
Whats ur gt?
---
&gt;Remove "Wouldn't it be Nice by The Beach Boys from the radio station"
---
How bloody dare you. Of all the songs I want removed that one is near the bottom of the list.
---
Old Man Mose, though... 
---
Player vendors will change the logic around campsites though. The most desirable spots will suddenly be in areas where the players you target with your products are going to be, in visible spaces near where players go to level up. Not every camp will need/want to be placed on the Whitespring golf course grounds anymore. 
---
Though I won't lie, my last few campsites have all been in places with views from above the Whitespring. And they're amazing, especially when the nukes start flying. All the fun of watching an atomic blast from a balcony just like Alistair Tenpenny but from much closer up.
---
Let me know bobby_rocket
---
how do you get those beautiful floors
---
Nice that would be a cool idea and no to the icon, I don't want people knowing where my camp is .. two douche bags shot up my camp for no reason ..
---
Its never a good idea to make a new character for a new build. Each level takes the same amount of XP so lvling from 2-3 or 24-25 doesnt matter. The latter character has the advantage of being able to get higher lvl perks faster and you dont have to rediscover places or redo quests and so on. At lvl 50 you can change your attributes so rerolling is pointless.
---
What do u want
---
Most of the people are Irish when I'm playing, so I presume that the servers are based on location.
---
It has been happening with any crafting station I use. I tried moving them all around my camp. I have just been wearing leather armor and the greaser jacket from the atomic shop.
---
Ahh.. very nice, thanks for the info :)
---
That definitely makes sense, especially after re-reading Barbarian and seeing that it's for use withOUT Power Armor. What would you suggest I replace those perks with during active combat? Just to max out the HW Damage tree?
---
Agreed, happened to me a few days ago, two little dick bags in PA, showed up at my camp and starting blasting it for no reason .. I guess bored and lame ..
---
Science, science expert, science master are all different cards and function separately. Look carefully at what the mods need. 
---
I killed a level 80 Scroch Beast last night around 2:30ish am est.
---
You havn'e drank enough alcohol my dude.. More than half of spirits probably come in plastic
---
I know it's a bit late, but from what I've read the tomahawk plans are found through completing some specific events, which you can find listed by googling tomahawk plans
---
Aside from having a different laser color ultracite has the awesome effect of bonus damage to scorched and when you toss a prime receiver on an ultracite it is even more.  An example is the laser pistol I have it takes 75% of the life of a 68 scorched were a normal identical takes like 20% . Tossing a prime one shots them and if you put a beam splitter it one shots groups.    
---
I think all helmets do, no?
---
Even the eyebot helmet gives you a nice shave. Same with wrapped.
---
Have you checked with r/Fallout76Factions?
---
But i just woke up from mine...
---
Yup! And get adrenaline from agility tree. It’s invaluable 
---
Does lvl 30 count as newb
---
&gt; although the available caps 
---
Are reset after 20 hrs. from when you first sold to them afyer the previous reset.
---
That sucks .. obviously a bug .. doubt clothes will make a difference but might be worth a shot. You probably need to log a ticket.
---
Oh wow. I was trying to do that a couple weeks ago and was wondering why it didn't work (that staircase seems designed to make stairwells with). I eventually just went "fuck it" and made a 2 floor house with an accessible roof.
---
Yup. It's damage and energy resistances are comparable to T-45 so if your goal is to be as tanky as possible you're better off with T-51b or at least X-01 or Ultracite, but T-60 is by far the cheapest to maintain. I use my T-60 for general purpose stuff and swap to my T-51b when I'm gonna farm a nuke zone or fight the Queen.
---
for some of us they were gone, noider why, couldn't find on between fissure prime (glass caverns) and watoga last night :/ some even said the fisures holes look blocked of, like a dirt pile, i didn't look...

You're*

If "YOUR" going to insult someone, do it right.

I don't know what cheap $10 wine boxes you're drinking but every bottle of alcohol I've ***ever*** purchased has come in a glass bottle.

I want to say wendingos drop maps a lot.
---
European here, 2:30 p.m. Est is equal to 8:30 p.m. GMT +1 (Amsterdam) right?
---
It sucks so bad when you accidentally target a player or robot and the game is lagging HARD because of all the shit going on at white springs to begin with. I'm attacking the ghouls in that parking lot and the robots come to "help me" and I brushed up against one of them bots and now I'm killed. It took my several tries to run in there and get my loot bag and run away without dying again.
---
I'm a heavy VATS melee user and I've targeted a player in VATS, with pacifist mode, while killing large groups of enemies (around top of the world/white springs) and I've had them think I was attacking them because they've taken health damage from one of the enemies. It sucks when you have so many enemies in a group and everyone in this moshpit and you are targeting the enemies and then the VATS target moves to someone else. Early on this happened at Top of the World in that house and doorway where it all gets clogged up and these two in a team killed my teammate because of it and I was lucky enough to run away from them to survive.
---
The recipes are sold in the same place.
---
I've only ever seen one and I bought it. RIP my caps.
---
Thanks for this, I was about to spend my evening going through all of my collected maps because of the post by u/kromtak but maybe I won't bother now :-)
---
Interesting that the T-60 plans were found near the vendor which sells T-60 plans as well.  
---
Do we will finally have a true actually Economy  supported in the game now.
---
Oooh good call, I was considering that one for a bit and ended up going with Barbarian thinking defense would be better lmao. Ok, i'll adjust my build and see how it looks while in combat vs. outside, thanks!
---
It almost feels like there is a meta game at work here, power up all the reactors, hack the subsystems, reroute the power to the #GOV.TOPSEC.PROJECT
---
Also it can be stored in your stash and still weighs only ten pounds. 
---
good place for plastic is the pumpkin house up in the north-east.  lots and lots of plastic pumpkins.  
---
Up north so I can have both those veins at once. I always need lead, and I like junk. It's one of the three places with two veins. 
---
My cousin has his down in the bog near the substation. We have a fast travel point for up north, in the middle, and down south for free. We like to hop events too. 
---
Congrats and I hate you. :)
---
In the fair grounds area left of the excavator in the ash heap, there are some robots that will give you quests that will reward you with tokens, these tokens can then be used to purchase a paddle ball
---
Do people really complain about that? I don't even use Power Patcher except for when I'm making repairs and it still takes forever for my gear to break. My heavy guns, on the other hand, feel like they're made of tissue paper even when using Gunsmith and repairing them to 200% durability.
---
He doesnt self die guys me and some buds farmed one for almost an hour couple days back, he never died till we put him down after we got what we wanted.
---
Queen drops
---
I have a three story brick house with an unfinished basement where all my crops are growing. Everything but my private quarters is accessible to the public. 
---
Or the mr. Fuzzy outfit!
---
Legendary drops might be your best bet.
---
Go to events and kill the legendarys there.
---
I have some good weapons, including an automatic grenade launcher...automatic Tesla, high level rifles etc. One scorch B lvl 50 and I dont bother with ranged, just wait for it to land and use a jacked up super sledge with+30 damage to animals, and it still takes me 15 minutes to bring it down. I'm lvl 93, and just looking for something you all talk about that has more power.
---
5150
---
Just RNG from legendary mobs. Gotta find one 2 stars or higher for a chance at both prefixes. Other than that, trading, because duping has resulted in an absurd amount of them floating around. 
---
2:30pm EST is in 6 minutes
---
Schorchbeast queen? Probably need to disclose I'm only level 30
---
I've found 1 calibrated shock and a torso mode that gives +1 strength (so +10 to carry) but you really have to farm it. I just check every time I log in and it took me almost 3 weeks of playing to find them. 
---
Hopefully BGS does something with power armor mods because right now they're not easy to find.
---
A few others have mentioned this, but I had it at the bottom since it's oddity in that it boosts two things: XP And AP.  I described in the TLDR at the bottom, but I guess that part isn't prominent enough.  I moved the description up the XP section so it should be clear to everyone now.
---
The balance issues are really starting to show now that we've gotten up to pretty high levels, and are seeing people at levels above \*500\*.  (Though the person I saw at 500 appeared to be working in tandem as a duper, popping in and out of the world withe a companion staying put.) 
---
The game has limited enough endgame content, and people are able to exploit/grind all the way past where that content exists as a challenge, this early on and that means we're dealing with a combination of systems where we're exceeding the game's difficulty curve and being hamstrung/limited by a vendor system that was designed to keep us from getting all the endgame gear they probably \*thought\* we'd need to make that endgame balance out.
---
Bethesda is stuck in a bind, and much of it is self-imposed. They released a game up against the holidays that wound up needing crazy levels of developer support, so nobody's around to fix it or even properly address the community rages that were caused by the myriad issues and fuckups they've made. 
---
This happens to me a lot. Usually once I get the several minutes later display, if I cancel out of it and then walk over to the crafting bench again it appears much more quickly. Not always though, but I'd say 80 percent of the time.
---
Super duper naps!

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a62apk/updated_weapon_mod_spreadsheet/
---
There are four you can get from scrapping. 
---
Post was removed, what was it a pic of?
---
I need me some coal miner’s daughter! 
---
I am level 136 and got my first two shot anything drop like two days ago (non explosive). You just have to grind legendary creatures. 
---
BE VERY CARFUL! I had this bug happen to me a while back and then a few days later all of my power armor just vanished when i was hopping out of my PA. Game started bugging and then crashed and I had none of my PA not any of the three I had on me... maybe drop one in your stash or put on an alt or something to be safe. 
---
I also had three sets of PA on me that I was modding and they were all separate and after a game crash they all stacked into one pile that said Power Armor Chassis (3) but is only 1 set of PA that is my Ultracite set... Lost a full t60 set with the tricent paint and a full 51B Nuka-Cola painted set... I've not had a lot of luck with PA LOL! 
---
Interesting, yep - I rechecked and didnt initially see that those 2 perks were for use without PA. Hahah well for experience, you've played a lot more than I have, so I'll trust your word! 
---
So only crafting perks AFTER 50, huh? Not even maybe to Tier 3 so I can build something useful while leveling up to 50? Also, what would you replace Barbarian/Iron Clad with, while still focusing on Heavy Weapons?
---
It is possible, just not the way they want to do it. They would have to do a rollback to fix it. Since they waited too long to fix it and even realize they should do a rollback, it would piss off just about everyone now.
---
The only way forward now is to create a new game mode, that you need to create a new character to get into. It would essentially fragment the player base, but with only 20ish players per game that probably isn't the end of the world or even matter for solo players.
---
The only downside would be that if you wanted to play with someone else. They would either have to create a new character to get into the new mode, or you both would have to play with your old existing chars when you play together.
---
Obvisouly the other issue is if they find another dupe glitch after the fact.
---
They should really learn from games like Diablo and WOW which is, you fix the issue as soon as possible and then rollback the servers to before the issue happened. Whether that is a few hours or a few days.
---
On console they can only release so many patches a week based on store certifications. So they would have to throw up a notice letting people know that they are planning a rollback to this date/time due to cheating bastards. So you can still play but your progress will be lost if you insist on playing.
---
I did this, usually trash mobs spawn but I think it also triggers other stuff, I had a 50 mirelook queen come at me with a bunch of kings and hunters. Then the normal bug spawns
---
Thanks, I guess I will need to play something else then for a while.
---
worth it if you’re looking for entertainment value 
---
I agree!  I miss The Wanderer song 
---
Where do you tend to find the best legendarys
---
That's brilliant. Didn't know multiple resources was possible! I've been getting mine from workshops nearby. 
---
This is what I have been doing as well, one shot hits like 3-4 enemies before they all insta-die to the person with the TSE weapon. This strategy has really helped me loot and level up in a nuke zone even without a TSE weapon.  
---
Apparently you've never made jello shots or mixed drinks with cheap vodka. Because that shit is all plastic. No need to buy expensive vodka. It's all the same when it's an ingredient.
---
Monster Mash is a PvP event. When someone picks up the mask, you can kill them, BUT they can also kill you! I farm Monster Mash all day every day for XP and legendaries and whenever some poor soul enters my domain i one-shot them with my power fist. Then if they have some good junk, like the other day some guy was carrying all his junk on his char in bulk. I got like 400 rubber and oil from him. Then i relog so they cant get it back and i deposit it in my stash. If someone kills me i just go kill them, i dont carry junk on me so there is no penalty for me dying.
---
But doesn't that just send them a message on the ps4? Not in the game itself 
---
IGN 10/10 "It just works!"
---
I liked Rose better in Borderlands when she was called Tina.
---
Same here as I’m in the Uk
---
Thanks. Guess i picked a good time to post!👍
---
Is it really the same amount of XP from level to level? Wow, I'd always thought it increased! Very good to know. I think with everyone recommending to continue with the current character and just adjust later on, I'll stick with this character and just correct my course, thanks for the info!
---
Thanks Divine I hope I don't get crickets, they are nasty to get rid of.
---
My meat hook will vary from 130 to 313 from what I've seen so far.
---
Big surprise when I didn't sneak attack that Grafton monster.  
---
ok so if you get an ultracite version of a weapon you can then put on a prime capacitor or receiver on it and the effects stack? That's cool! 
---
I was wearing the mask. I remember seeing a msg that mentioned I had dropped it on death. I was not wearing it the 2nd go-round when he died. From now on I won't loot junk until after the event is complete. Thank you.
---
You may think that, but what location did the SR71 spend a lot of time flying over?  COMMUNIST RUSSIA.
---
 I have a TSE and don’t use it. I usually blow myself up, the car I am standing on, or only get one or two hits before they all get whacked. The Tesla is a much better quantity method in my opinion. 
---
Events or farming mobs at a nuked Whitesprings. The best events to head to are Uranium Fever (you'll get three 1-3 star legendary mobs, although the legendary pieces can vary from level 25-35 so it's not that great), AWOL Armaments (a guaranteed 50+ 3 star mob), Heart of the Swamp used to have a chance for a legendary but I haven't seen one there the last several runs, Monster Mash apparently has a good chance for them, and One Violent Night spawns one 3 star wendigo (also, if you avoid using the instruments and making noise, constant waves of ghouls will spawn and legendaries will pop up frequently). 
---
so if the serum is 4800 how much is the plan LOL!!!
---
I have the plan on PC, I can craft you one in exchange for the materials required, if you want. 
---
yeah not sure what's going on
---
Ohhh, I didn't even realize that. Thanks!
---
Awesome tip. I also use photo mode like binoculars. I move the camera up and out and then reduce the field of view to zoom.
---
RNG get lucky.
---
I have friends who are 240+ and farmed nukes for WS/Queens to no avail.
---
Just keep at it. Eventually you'll get something it just might not be what you wanted EXACTLY.
---
Save things that are of value and trade for what you want. 
---
Just a small QOL addition I would like to see. I would like the ability to add markers in the map of locations of things like safes/doors/terminals that are too high a skill at the moment. Sort of like in BotW 
---
New Vegas required a shovel to rob graves as well.
---
So excited to try, thank you everyone!
---
Actually on many servers they are not spawning as they should be. Not only are the elevators at the silos glitched, but the fissure sites have been sealed up as well. 
---
Imgur works fine
---
There's no guarantee that luck plays a part. My data implies that it does, but I would have to do more testing.
---
Really nice post. You made a great job by collecting all these issues/suggestions and putting them together.
---
I hope Bethesda takes a deep look at this things cause the most are things that are a MUST HAVE 👍
---
I don't believe so, no. At the very least I never got the popup you usually get when getting caps.
---
22K, iirc. I had a friend spot me caps just to get it...
---
The actual serum crafting cost is trivially low. It's like 1 flux, gold, antiseptic.
---
I enjoyed all of them thoroughly. 
---
I just came into them enjoying nods to the originals, not for them to take 0 creative license with a franchise that would be non existent if they hadn't bought it for dirt cheap. 
---
Very much this. Have to keep trying to remember to use left instead of right, but it's really counterintuitive when the target I'm looking for is just to the right of the current lock.  I wish they had left d-pad controls customizable (FO4 style).
---
People on team chat can't hear people on area chat even if they're on a team. Often times people just don't think to fiddle with this setting and it can make it impossible to talk. 
---
It's not meant to be realistic. If it was, we wouldn't have mutated monster animals, or killer plants. Does it make sense one bobby pin weighs a tenth of a pound? No. But it does. And it's so the game has some level of balance for a survival game. Does it make sense that you can carry around 20 different types of grenades, and 5-10 weapons?
---
I personally don't think the issue was the fix itself, but all the re-testing that is needed when you make a change like that.
---
RNGsus must bless you. I have had around 20 TSE 2 and 3\* drop at whitesprings, being in a party and doing the whitespring reset works best.   
---
The only other time I have gotten one is watoga and one from AWOL arms but I will tell you those are such a low chance that it is just evidence of some are blessed and others are not.   
---
Also if you are sub 50 suck it it butter cup my first TSE was level 40 and it was a level 35 pump.   
---
I assume they hit some, miss others. 
---
They largely miss me.
---
Yay! Glad to hear that you’re liking the place &lt;3 likewise, if you see a 1x1 brick building with a snowman on the roof, feel free to grab the water and crops and make yourself at home =D 
---
Thank you for the advice, I really appreciate it. I am going to try and play later today, if it does it again, I will have to submit a ticket.
---
This is my number one request now. At least let us rename the frames at a bare minimum.
---
Please say you're on PC... I would love to trade the mats for one. 
---
Yeah what most of my friends and I agree on is that this will be a fun game when it is finished :/ 
---
I enjoy the hell out of it but there are some aspects that needed to be fixed a while ago (eg the dupers totally screwing the economy while BGS is on vacation) that are still present. 
---
If you have free time and high enough luck (although there's no guarantee it plays a part), you could still do them if you're missing C.A.M.P plans. They're not completely worthless, but the chance of them dropping something of value seems to be very rare.
---
**Solution: Instantly kill any character with +2000 over their carrying capacity. Removing that character from the game and it's loot.**
---
If you buy a paint scheme from the atomic store it will have the atom logo beside “Power Armour Chassis” in your inventory. Would help you distinguish one set at least. 
---
hey raider, sorry to do this on your thread, but: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MntEPye0hC0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MntEPye0hC0)
---
Check out  the fellow raider :\*
---
The forced PA and ballistic fiber issue are so huge for me because the ONLY reason I use PA these days is for irradiated areas and to keep my actual armor from breaking and sending me on a hunt for more ballistic fiber
---
It wasn't even their series. They saved that IP from the dumpster fire that was Interplay folding up. 
---
If they hadn't bought the IP and made fallout 3. Fallout would be a dead franchise.
---
wow! thats crazy! I'll just buy the serum form a player for 500-1k caps lol
---
I enjoyed all of them too, &amp; still enjoying 76. I enjoy them for what they are, not for what a minority group of 'purists' expect them to be.
---
I still also can't read probably 3/4 of the notes I pick up. The text is cut off on the side or the background is too dark for it to be legible.
---
Whoohoo! Can't wait for this fix! Thank you for letting us know!
---
You hush your mouth..... ;)
---
Maybe a cool down period? Can only pay off your bounty once a day or every other day? 
---
If you don't mind me asking. Did you buy yours from one of those cd keys websites?
---
Just to be 100% clear you must either  
---
1. Kill them before they suck any of your blood - so kill them before they touch you
---
or
---
2. If they do suck your blood wait for them to spit it at you and then kill them after
---
As long as they are not bloated with red blood they shouldn't explode.
---
Also quick tip you may already know - go to the moonshiners shack just south of Vault 76 for 2-3 ticks including a large vile one.  
---
I'm pretty sure the tick blood drops have been nerfed at some point, I used to get a lot more off them.
---
From what ive seen, he dies after an hour or so, so he lasts quite a while
---
You got Bethesda'd!
---
I would rather them take servers down with 15 minutes notice to fix the Nuke issue than to have a fix and wait to give 24 hours (or however much notice you think is appropriate).  
---
Glad they are rolling a fix, I have been able to nuke since midnight NYE.
---
You both have to tag each other, every bullet after that does normalized damage. MY video isn't gaining any traction. People are still mad about the newb murdering video, so may just make more of those griefing videos from now on because this one actually took more work than last week.
---
Opening a thousand nuka colas vs selling them. Pretty easy to understand why those players are choosing the latter. Not to mention radiation management.
---
Love, love never changes.
---
does that get you all the recipes or just 1? like do you only get speed demon or marsupial or do you get them all?
---
Lol that’s really weird
---
They didn't really replicate earlier success.
---
They saved that IP from going dead when they bought it. 
---
And made it a significantly bigger part of gamer culture than the originals ever managed to. 
---
1 &amp; 2 may have been some of the under pinnings for the Bethesda games. But at this point the Bethesda games are Fallout. That game setting and it's lore, it's feel, it's content come from Bethesda
---
Feels very incompetent. :( 
---
Only 1.
---
When you have two items, boiled water or purified water, with one clearly being the “better” of the two in every way, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to make so many recipes depending on the shittier of the 2 imo. Boiling water is a waste of time and wood and nothing else and has no business being a “vital” item when purified water would absolutely substitute just fine. My mind won’t change on this so save your keystrokes lol
---
Duper = Duplicator 
---
What is this Juper
---
I wonder how long this will take. A few hours knowing Bethesda. Just kicked mid session. A heads up would have been nice
---
You don’t know luck til you get the 3-star Assassin’s Rolling Pin
---
Yeah I'm on PC.
---
Aaan d servers going down for maint right now.
---
PC ones just went on maintenance
---
Well you have a good style at least. Best of luck and thanks for the tip
---
Xbox as well 
---
Early Game i used to hit up Anchor Farm near the vault for 2 ammo bags (4xBallistic Fiber) One in the APC and one near the skeletons as you make your way towards the house. Its not a huge source but doing that everyday added up.
---
Im secretly wishing they come and attack my camp... jajaha
---
You can PvP in real life but if you do it out side of the correct situation you get penalized. 
---
You stick people in video games and suddenly they become assholes. 
---
I appreciate that. But at the same I assumed the reddit was for voicing your opinion of the game, whether it be positive ot negative. I just feel telling people you don't care about their opinion because you don't agree with it is contrary to what reddit should used for. 
---
If anyone is short on ammo there is a lead vein next to an acid vein in south savage divide that fit in a camp boundary. . The lead for obvious reasons, you can make gunpowder off of acid and cloth, and then you just need steel (for most ammo) 
---
Even when I have they dont seem to want to land
---
As a sysadmin, sometimes “hotfixes” fail and you have to down the servers. Shit happens man. More times than not, the test environment is production.
---
Yeah, it's strange. I've spent the last day farming BoS plans in the bog mainly because the SB's aren't spawning right, so it's made things way easier lol.
---
Watoga High School has an odd PvP event if you go inside with lots of high level enemies.
---
Any idea for how long?
---
Unfortunately the best method to get plans still appears to be server hopping, which I'm sick of to be honest. These maps could have been a great way to get the good stuff.
---
Keep an eye out for the waterproofing upgrade available in the Atomic Shop in Q4 2019 for only 2000 Atoms!
---
To tell you the truth, I thought she was voiced by Cree Summer for the longest time.
---
Responders vendor bot is better and it’s not close. 
---
At this point I’m just happy to have been warned. Even if it was last second
---
Just got home. Sad
---
I always wondered how/if this worked with the STR perk card that reduces fusion core energy while sprinting in PA.  maybe the STR perk is for wearing PA and the Agility Marathoner perk is for outside of PA.
---
I havent tested, but would be curious to know if anyone else has.
---
Ah well Netflix it is then 
---
I use reddit 
---
During the time I actually was going through Toxic Valley last, I believe. I don't think I had any other #3 maps. Or maybe I'm remembering wrong.
---
Marine armor....big bulky looks like powered armor.  But not quite even has little kickstand looking things in the feet....helmet....looks like an alien frog....was it designed be a different person?
---
I would rather they communicate properly from start to finish.
---
This isn't just players being inconvenienced/losing items and workshops from the surprise 10 minute notice because what always follows is 1-4 hours of mysterious downtime.
---
WHAAAAAT!!!!!! That's even more insane! I thought signs and letters at 9k was crazy but that allows me to do a ton of cool things in my CAMP... 1 serum recipe for 22k!!! that is just bonkers!!!
---
I think this is where I put my camp....
---
.. and mine looks like a turd compared to this. :') I'm inspired!
---
AHHHHHHH I totally overlooked this! thank you so much.
---
Yeah I mod all my weapons and put everything on for shits and giggles even if it's just for a very negligible improvement.
---
I'll pay attention now! thanks man
---
Yeah i'm putting points in luck because I want the bloody mess perk and I'll look into the white knight one!
---
and of course maintenance starts as soon as I sit down to play...
---
Go to the High Schools, they're loaded with plastic plates and cutlery. Watoga High School can be a pain in the ass with the constantly respawning flood of ghouls and Monster Mash opening you up to PvP, but if no one's around and you're not using an explosive weapon (trying to fight ghouls in close quarters with explosives is a one way ticket to the respawn screen, plus they'll launch the plastic you're looking for all over the damn school), a quick pass through can net you 100+ plastic in a minute or two.
---
Dont think its in game yet, the nuka cola one is available though. I have a feeling if they do introduce the hotrod paint job it will be via the atom store
---
just got the automatic barrel for the tesla
---
Just started playing again on Xbox how long you think it will be down ?
---
Hopefully it's a quick one. I'm ready to play when I get off work. 
---
Considering they have a timer on screen when the servers shut down 
---
I do it cause I crash like a mad dog. I crouch in a corner and spam team requests the second I know a nuke is coming so that when I inevitably disconnect I can get back in for that juicy flux.
---
You should be able to just hyperlink the imgur link in the text of your post.
---
The reason this sub, and many other game subs dont allow direct images posts is to help reduce the amount of ultra low effort content.
---
Heres my camp :D
---
Stop saying it doesn't make sense. It does make sense. It's a GAME MECHANIC. Just because you can't understand why or accept something in a game that isn't realistic, doesn't mean it doesn't make sense.
---
But go ahead. Waste your life being angry over boiled/purified water. 
---
hOTFIX INCOMING!
---
Just make a imgur gallery and post the link here
---
Im sure people with instigating weapons love you lol
---
Maybe a one time "re-roll" offer in the event of quest rewards so that if you get a duplicate plan you can choose to accept it or receive a different randomly generated plan. 
---
Goddamn I am jealous. Pump shotgun is my favorite gun in the game.
---
That's the same painting from 4. I have it hanging in my "Church of the Todd".

Okay thanks I'm sub 50 so I'll work onlevelling up. Anybody know good ex methods?
---
PS4 also.
---
Those are not actual recipes, likely quest items. Recipes are titled like "Recipe: Gourd Goulash" with the recipe section at the front of it, followed by the colon and name of the food item.
---
They should make like Han Solo and shoot first!
---
I believe a lot of the TSE were found early on in the games release before BGS nerfed Whitesprings nuke zone, and other vents.  There used to be a lot more 3\* legendary monsters to kill.  and now they have been duped into Oblivion, so its less that eveyrone is finding and more that most people have acquired a duped TSE.
---
you saw two people and you assumed they were duping? what even made you think that. idk whats going on with peoples connection but i havent been disconnected once in the last couple weeks and i HAVE been next to people duping.
---
Nuke zones farming legendary items, espeically whitespring golf course.
---
Intelligence doesn't affect XP gains.
---
I'm waiting for level 50 to start looking for these.
---
They should allow DDO-style reincarnations, where you come back as someone else, but with a few perk cards from your previous life and a couple extra ability points.  It requires more XP per level, so you have to work through more content to get to 50 again.
---
Game should remember your 3rd person camera setting so those of use who play melee in 3rd person don't have to stop to move the camera way back every time we reload/get booted/transition areas etc.
---
I have the targeting HUD on my X01. I love it as a sniper all enemies glowing makes life a lot easier.
---
Usually between 1-4 hours. But it could be longer 
---
Same here bud, just bought a tse 50 cal for that queen.  
---
The American English pronunciation of "duplicate" uses the "doo" sound. The British English pronunciation of "duplicate" uses a "djoo" sound. That's what the OP is talking about. They are suggesting people use the British English version.
---
Thank you for the tip, this is the only time I’ve dropped Power Armor because every time I’d try and place the Chassis it would make the sound but not place down. 
---
Hey, mine was originally just a big cube. It wasn't until I saw other, more well-designed camps that I was inspired to really learn how the tile sets work (they can be wonky) and tackle something better. Just need a little patience and time to put in. I actually tore this down 4 times in the process of building it.
---
Some Tips. BASE CHR of 6 is helpful, you don't need higher than that.  Use mothman omlettes, sweet rolls, grape mentats, x-cell, unyielding armor to raise your CHR.  I was able to get a 22 soft CHR with a base of 6.  You do NOT need both Animal Friend and Wasteland Whisperer. They actually overlap on some animals.  Depending on the type of animal, depends on the perk.  Deathclaws worth for either, Mirelurks for animal friend, etc.. 
---
If Tame does not pop up at first, pacify and wait for it to unpacify, try again.  
---
I have a question that semi belongs here. Is the Gamma Gun silenced? Because if not adding that could make it more useful ingame. Same with say the Alien blaster. 
---
I was just doing the monster mash event in Watoga and I killed this guy with a Deathclaw gauntlet when he had the mask, he ended up coming back killing me 3 times, This could not stand. So after they left and FT away I scoured for him no the map but couldnt find him cause he was sneaking but I knew the other guy there in power armor was in his party so I found him FT to near their base went up and announced myself, The deathclaw gauntlet guy opens the door and swipes me a couple times, I proceed to pull out my Furious power fist beat him to death and for good measure finish him off immediatly because he had a life saving piece that got the drop on me earlier and then his friend started firing at me and he had popped out of his PA so I just went to town on them, got my junk and both of their junks back, got out of there , I have chameleon so I lingered around watching them try to find me and then i started chucking all my grenades at their water purifier farm they had like 6 and they were scouring the area but couldnt tell where my grenades were coming from. Morale of the story is don't !@#$ with me. #Raiders!
---
I guess that would work, but really interfere with gameplay.
---
This isn't a bug.
---
That's the thing about purists....
---
Bethesda has now built more of the fallout universe than interplay had.
---
Well for some reason it still doesn't work, and server maintenance threw a wrench into our plans
---
Hope it fixes the dupe glitches. Tired of people with hundreds of op guns. 
---
You can get padded/dense on your regular armor.  Not sure about power armor.  But it makes fighting schorchbeasts without PA worthwhile anyway.
---
Whitesprings golf course lobby is the best way to farm for the explosives, I haven't gotten a two-shot but I just earlier found an exploding BP pistol with a hunter on it. And that was just from normal ghoul farming with nukes being down.
---
These stairs let you stack 2 walls on top of each other if you surround the staircase. Like 1 brick wall facing in and 1 facing out. You can do interesting stuff like "picture frames" by stacking a wall with a window and a solid wall in the same spot
---
i've asked the same thing and the mods just keep saying "imgur works fine", personally I hate that we can't add pics and see no reason not to have them allowed but whatever... I like to see images without having to go to a 3rd party site or another popup tab...
---
I forgot we can’t announce it more than 20 minutes before it happens. 
---
Yep for a hot fix. 
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
"Ban players who don't play the game how I want them to play!"
---
I haven't seen this problem yet, but I was able to "search" tick bodies multiple times last night.
---
Heh. Tick "bug"
---
good thing you aren't from uk, 7:30 pm, prime time. work a 9-5:30 like most and your four gaming hours each day are 6:30- 10:30 if you are lucky. of course beth decides that is the best time to shut down.  
---
This is actually a great idea which sounds implementable.
---
That's a great idea. Ammo is always needed. 
---
I think it’s just for the y2k bug the dupe thing seems like a bigger problem
---
Now imagine having best of both words in one game
---
I did all the maps I've had the whole time leveling in 1 day. I'm now the proud owner of 7 T-45 motion assisted servos
---
All servers down right now for a nuke silo hotfix.
---
I'll look when I get home after the hotfix
---
A small but highly desired feature for me
---
Is this to fix the nuke codes?
---
I have an hour to myself when I get home from work @ 6:30pm EST. So the servers will be up @ exactly 7:30pm EST.
---
Usually how it works for me. 
---
Too bad females don't get hair longer than shoulder length in game. Of course, clipping is bad as it is.
---
Very cute picture :)
---
Squirrel, squirrel, squirrel, cat, dog, beaver, radstag calf, squirrel...why are there so many animals next to a giant angry apex predator?
---
I'm the other way around. This world feels lonelier because I always feel five minute late from crossing someone's path. Reading the terminals and the notes, and listening to the holotapes makes me feel worse because I know no matter how far I travel, I'll never catch up to them.
---
I'll just add you on Discord and try later, my kids aren't doing what they originally were anyways so I won't be on till later.
---
Same if I'll post my locations on another subreddit more focused on C.A.M.P.S
---
YES! I've been doing the same with moltovs
---
I did an Enclave one for doing one of those orbital strike things... and got mobbed by 30 or so Super Mutants.  Melee'd them all to death.  With some car explosions for fun.  Vampire Melee weapons are pretty badass if you ever find any.
---
It's old style marketing, nothing new. 
---
What do you play on? For me it hardly ever works.
---
how long?
---
I use a pistols 15 AGI/LCK character who crits for days so I constantly use VATS. The amount of time I get thrown outta VATS because a melee player runs in and breaks my LoS or I'm trying to lock on to crit the Legendary Glowing Deathclaw beating the shit outta my friend but VATS locks onto him is infuriating.
---
VATS should definitely not lock on to people on your team. You can't even harm one another!
---
&gt;I even checked the map to make sure there wasn't a player there that defended for me. 
---
Most likely a random player was there. You don't show up on the map when you are in sneak mode. I regularly show up for defense events at other people's workshops, and spend 90% of my time in stealth.
---
Can farm legendary monsters as well. Just have to know where they always are
---
I think that's the BoS uniform (not the exact right name) my characters wearing it but I'm not home. It's kinda a lightish camp pattern that fits under armor.
---
Funny enough jess gave. Rough time for servers going down 42 minutes ago 
---
Anyone know what hotfix is coming?
---
Hahahaha this game
---
That's actually copied from the post on Nov 27
---
Main reason I try to find the most secluded area no one ever really ventures to
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/308966/fallout-76-maintenance-january-2-2019/2
---
Stranger danger!
---
What system
---
lol, yeah, had the primary receiver for my gauss for a while, but have stocked up on flux before i wanted to switch, ultracite ammo is really hard to make :/
---
They announced last night that they were investigating the issue and a fix would be coming today. 
---
I guess from now on they should announce fixes for 1-day old issues 3 days in advance, right?
---
That’s genius 
---
When I finally hit level 60 I assumed I’d be able to fight those level 50 scorchbeasts. I haven’t seen a level 50 in some time. Mainly 65 and 80. If the foes get tougher as we level, we should have a means of fairly fighting them. I don’t mind putting in some effort to win a battle but at level 60 I should not have to use the same duck and cover tactics I did at level 10.
---
I just downloaded and got to play long enough to get out of the vault.  Did not realize this was an online only game.
---
Great wsy to get lead and steel is do a silo run and pick up the scraps from the robots, or go on a robot murder spree in watoga.
---
On the one hand, this baby with One Gun Army and Stabilized makes Scorchbeasts land easily.  On the other hand, I can run through 1000 rounds before half the fight if I'm not watching and they just don't land.
---
Very nice! Great set up.  Where are you located? 
---
I've got a little budget space left, but unsure what to do with it. Been thinking about doing something similar to what you have and expand the garage to contain all my workbenches and not just my PA station. 
---
A true architect never stops tweaking!  Lol. 
---
It doesn’t make sense 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
45 mins
---
That is what all the information seem to be pointing to. They said they would try and implement a hot fix to fix the bug on the nuclear silos cool down timer being at 9999. 
---
PS4 make sure you actually equipped the mod and not just placed it on the chassis which is a thing for some reason.
---
I did patrol duty last night...crossbow plans.
---
Guess how many mods I can learn for the crossbow?
---
What? Applying paint doesn't destroy your mods. I put Blackbrid on my X-01 and didn't lose any mods.
---
Id like to know the answer to this myself
---
Look at syringer...cries...
---
I duped my power armor too some weeks ago, without having any idea how it happened. I had an empty chassis as far as i remember, and another chassis holding my actual powerarmor. While i was figuring out which was which ( thanks to the game not showing the actual armor equipped to chassis) i somehow duplicated the equipped armor into my inventory, while it was still equipped on the chassis itself. I tried to attach it to the empty chassis and it worked, ending up with 2 identical sets.
---
I scrapped one completely, closed the game, restarted and all was good. 
---
All I have left are calibrated shocks for my X-01. I have actually only ever seen one of them and that was for Excavator.  
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Based on what
---
Oh gotcha. I hadn’t seen them say anything about it but thank you for pointing that out. 
---
You have had some great RNG on the power armor plans. I have dug up about 20 maps and received some great loot, but never a power armor plan.
---
Yeah. If Bethesda buffed their loot tables it would be worth it, but as it stands unless you need more ivory grips and wooden stools, treasure maps aren't worth it.
---
Mods need to sticky an announcement on these things.  Granted they need communication from Bethesda.  I get told often to google it or use twitter.  But neither of these ways are as good as a reddit check.
---
Im happy though that nukes will be back.  Has felt really strange roaming the wasteland without nukes and scorchbeasts.
---
No idea, but they are fixing the nuke silos, I have been trying all day to blow of my first nuke, and the hand scanner turns red, and I cAnt get into any of the silos, ridiculous
---
YeAh!
---
Sadly no. None of the weight reduction perks apply to stash, only to displayed weight calculation "how much it would weight in your inventory"
---
just stepped out of the vault too end then the disconnect timer ended 
---
Keep in mind the codes would have reset, so we can’t fire nukes off the rip
---
Than kyou for this link when the servers are back up map hunting time
---
Wouldnt be suprised if its more than just fixing the nukes, they love throwing in secret changes.
---
No worries 
---
I just wish there were some official time statements. There's nothing on their twitter, the places they direct you to go after the short warning and server closure.   
---
It took like 30 seconds in IRL to reload black powder guns. That's if you're trained.
---
It's just a hot fix, can't imagine it'll take them too long. they again, who knows...
---
you got any extras???
---
Yeah, unless I'm running by a location I just wait until I have like 7 of the same map before making an effort to get there and play the RNG lotto.
---
That would work. But in a hurry, like combat, being able to have a title on the power armor like “combat” and “carry weight” would be easier
---
There is a reason.
---
Its to prevent people from just posting low effort content, and instead having to give at least a little text description, while hyperlinking to the images in the text.
---
Same thing done by /r/destinythegame and other subs I go on. And it does help.
---
Yea same here.  I’m just going to get all the others then make an alt 
---
Why should I be relaxed? They release a buggy game and yeah, shit happens that can't be anticipated but the consistent sporadic level of communication is not only unprofessional but much like everything to do with this game lazy.
---
Sorry if I feel paying customers should be treated better. This shit isn't indie game of the week, its a product with millions of dollars spent on marketing/development/release/servers and Bethesda doesn't put any effort into the most basic aspects of trying to make the game better.
---
I spammed last night because we were tracking a nuke card but we had no sniper
---
You’ll get the well-rested bonus at least!
---
My budget is full atm but ill definitely be redesigning it when i feel like it. Im located a bit north nuka cola plant And below the pier.
---
I got my TSE pump action at about LV. 180. It’s my only good find and I got pretty lucky with it. It’s definitely not a duped once since the third mod is a VATS perk which is pretty useless
---
The Field Scribe Outfit has a backpack. 
---
Oh I am loading up on Molotov cocktails now are arming that Tesla rifle. I am the fly in the ointment now. 
---
I believe it's One Gun Army -- the Luck perk that gives heavy weapons a % chance to stagger or cripple.  If you fire in bursts at the SB you'll hear the cripple sound (maybe), and after that they have a chance to land.  You can kind of see the animation change to a swoop that turns into a dive-landing, but they don't land every time for some reason (probably terrain).  If they don't land you can see them go back to regular attack patterns (because it's all you can see get it haha) and then you have to cripple them again.
---
This is the one I always get, for some reason.
---
Agreed. This is what I love.
---
In New Vegas and 4, for example, I liked using alternative start mods to put me in some position other than the main protagonist of the primary narrative and instead just roleplayed as characters including merchants, hunters, and many more who had little interest in doing the major story quests after I've already done them more than enough to get sick of always being the only one acting with agency... No matter how urgent the mission is, it can wait for me to fuck around forever and I can come back and everyone's right where they're supposed to be and no one comments on how I've spent a month in Nuka World (except Preston, but he doesn't mention how late you are for storming the castle, just how you've betrayed his trust).
---
In this game, I can take on the role of a caravan doctor or a raider or what have you. My moral objections to the enclave and brotherhood don't stop me from playing the game. I can still join in on nuke zones if I feel like it, I just haven't been able to launch them myself. Not being a completionist also means I don't really mind that I'm missing out on the quests. TBH, the thing I miss the most is the extra daily caps and the recipes available to be sold directly to me without having to pay another player to go in for me... But I'm still willing to do that because the enclave are some evil fucks and I don't actually mind trading with players.
---
I dont like his.... random.... unnecessary..... pauses....
---
Sounds like he's raising his.... eyebrows.... at me. 
---
That is all.
---
And locations for people who don't have them memorized: [http://dulfy.net/2018/12/02/fallout-76-treasure-maps-guide](http://dulfy.net/2018/12/02/fallout-76-treasure-maps-guide/#Forest_Treasure_Maps) 
---
This works with the Railway Rifle and the Crossbow as well
---
Speak for yourself.  I use my 3 Star legendary ski sword and I’m a stealth sniper 
---
No.  I really liked the other fallouts, so I just had a little faith it would be good.  Im fine with online only.  
---
There's a possible (low chance, maybe, not sure about it) DLC roadmap in one of the terminals in game.
---
Except that making them both work the exact same isn't required to make them better. STR directly buffing melee and unarmed damage has been how FO has always worked, even in the originals, yet overall balance was still more than achievable. 
---
For me also not to use the same button for stmpacks as change targets, I've edited vats and use a stimpack unintentionally multiple times
---
I had someone with a shit attitude come storming into my workshop guns blazing and just mowed me down instantly (they were a 137 in power armor and I’m a puny 35). 
---
I respawned back into the area to pick up my loot and then figure out what the hell was going on. 
---
He instantly mowed me down again, took over my workshop and then 4 of his buddies showed up (100+ lvl with power armor) and basically picked on me until I left the server. 
---
Toxic players make this game so unfun it’s not even funny. 
---
True. I would hope that their ultimate goal would be allowing us to rename all weapons and armor, but since you can already Inspect the chassis for a close up view it seemed like a good stop gap measure.
---
Thet have not given fine details on the vending 
---
Besides, for base stalkers like me, I don't need a map icon to find your hidey hole. 
---
BASED ON WHAT
---
Pc for sure. Just kicked 
---
it will take about 1 hour for the hotfix and another hour for the new bugs to be installed.  Heard they messed up the coding and all Supermutants will morph into WWE classic wrestlers.
---
who knows with Beth. lol.
---
Happens to me and my friend fairly frequently. Sometimes there isn't even a name plate.
---
Ive had it happen. Im pretty sure switching servers would help. Ive seen it where my friends nametag would be floating somewhere my friend was, but they'd be way way ahead of me. Also a friend disconnected, but their name tag was still there
---
What sucks is some of us can not pass through the beam field at the maintenance shed and inside the Whitespring entrance because it can be bugged. 
---
To defend  Bethesda a bit,
---
They had their first workday after the holidays today, probably started working on this the minute they walked in,
---
how could the at that time announced a hotfix they didn't now 100% would be finished today ?
---
I am just happy that they did it this quick...
---
This particular safe forces itself open and has a contents of 0 and won’t allow anything to be put in. No delay here. 
---
Has the SBQ do this after her health regen on my last Scorched Earth. It was nice.
---
Yea past couple nights some SB's would touch down and then immediately take off (on PS4)
---
Get yourself a hazmat suit and an entire boat load of Molotov’s and server hop till you find a nuke dropped at whitesprings.
---
Turn pacifist mode on chuck the fire goodness at the groups of ghouls to get tags 
---
I’m not even going to dignify that with an answer
---
The US government cannot be trusted.
---
GET SOME!!
---
Trophies you should have gotten via beta don't count
---
Exactly the one. Now her birthday is stuck in my head...
---
Yeah I don't even worry about level up challenges anymore since they, you know, nerfed XP.   Add in how random and often misleading the challenge modifiers are ("formal wear" for female characters has changed at least 3 times) and it's more efficient to go pick 500 locks for the same number of atoms.
---
Meanwhile, people go to bed hungry...
---
This is a game which runs as a service. Same goes for data centers and cloud services, if you're going to sell your service as being available 24/7 and take money for that, you'd best be prepared to have staff working around the clock.
---
Even if its just having someone on night shift for when non-US players experience game breaking bugs, there should always be someone following what goes on.
---
Tin can traps :)
---
One can is worth 1 lead and 2 steel
---
Never knew about that place for mods - thanks for sharing!
---
Honest guess 30 minutes or less.  Even Bethesda doesnt usually keep things down for a hotfix for long and it appears silos were just turned off for 2019 or something that is hopefully just a key error.
---
Rip. Would they announce when it would be back up?
---
You won't be finding recipes that will be more beneficial than legendary drops. A lot of the best in slot weapons still require pretty high level to craft.  If you aren't against fast traveling I recommend completing public events which will net you legendaries of varying levels but for the most part they'll be tailored to your level.
---
Also as for heavy weapons, you should really focus leveling skills. It looks like you aren't SUPER WEALTHY, pardon me if I'm wrong... lol.
---
I'd recommend you get some melee skills and auto/single rifle perks.
---
After 50 transfer cards to heavy weapons.
---
I didn't find many decent heavy weapons in 1 through 50 :/ 
---
It's different, but I think that's a good think. If it tried to be multiplayer NV or something, I think it would get very boring.
---
He's not your guy, buddy
---
I got bored of my TSE since everyone is using. Having loads of fun with Bloodied Power Fist + VATS teleporting. Still can’t tag fast enough if people are sniping with TSE though :(
---
Well crap that does suck
---
We'll I'll be using that mod from now on. Also I've been using mods like many others and haven't been banned.
---
Good point about the NPCs. I just wish they would stay still while talking. Rosie drove me crazy floating across the room while talking. lol. 
---
Can't speak for higher level players, but as a lower level character I avoid that one like the plague.  Any event with heavily armored mobs is painful for me.  
---
Can we get this pinned to the top of the sub? 
---
There are so many reposts in the sub, it seems like no one reads the rules. 
---
I think NPC's would bring some much needed life to the map, the surroundings &amp; the environment. 
---
ya if you do Distant Thunder many times a day you'll end up with piles of the PA servo plans.  Pretty useless.
---
Do they announce when it would be back up? I know its it's happened before
---
There are 4 suits that spawn in Watoga that can haveT-45, T-51b and T-60. Getting a full set is fairly easy.
---
I had that issue last night with a team mate. Fast Traveling would fix it for a bit, but then entering into a new cell through a door seemed to make him turn invisible. It was amusing, but also mildly annoying since he's new and I was trying to walk him through some things and couldn't see what he was doing.
---
You have to start a new character to earn those trophies, sadly. I’m in the same situation and have to start again for the leave the vault etc trophies. 
---
Well I mean, I just am farming for days to get at least one good gun, while I see people with hundreds of the best guns selling them, or swapping for a new one instead of repairing the old ones. Same with jetpack armor. It's just annoying.
---
I never said anything about the game not being buggy. My original comment still stands - relax. Go outside. Take a deep breath. Your "lost scrap" is easily replaceable. The game will be back online soon, and you will feel whole again.
---
Perfect timing, left work early so I can play for 2 or 3 hours. Get in and claim two workshops, put down some generators and excavators, and then the message pops up.  FFS...
---
Pick the flower. Bag will become available to interact with. Job done.
---
You should relax because nobody needs to get this upset about a game. This whole post is just nitpicking for the hell of it. They can't win. Even when they're trying to fix shit people are immediately bitching about how they go about it. 
---
I had a 3 Star furious gold club with 40% faster swing rate.
---
If only mr house was in the game
---
This is the comment I was hoping for
---
That’s pretty much what happened for me except it appeared when I got into the spare chassis. 
---
any idea how long they'll be down?  Haven't been around (@ work) for the other patch maintenance times
---
Lands right in prime UK play time, Mother Hubbards…..
---
A reputation system would be great, help us sort the raiders from the scavengers.  We could always develop teams of "Responders" to fight these gosh darn raider that keep messing up our quality of life.
---
I agree. I’m so relieved when I enter a server where it’s only lvl 30’s or below. 
---
It’s like once you hit lvl 100 you just think the whole wasteland is yours. 
---
It could be the end result of them needing to prove to investors to give them the time to train and work on new dev tools before we see ES6 or FO5. That would be nice. 
---
Might be too late for Starfield but it would be nice to have for later on. 
---
Since that's the common cause of disconnecting, I assumed that's what was doing it.
---
No one has a "right" to a workshop under any circumstance. 
---
Take them if you want them. They are pvp zones. When i have a workshop, i wang ppl to challenge it.
---
Workshops belong to the strongest player or group on the server.
---
Problem i have is when i own too many (4+) the game crashes. So i prioritize taking workshops that are already owned.  Better chance at pvp. 
---
Gonna drop this here, had some thoughts that tie into the whole 'planters' bit https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a6i7fb/farming_overhaul_in_appalachia/
---
Also: for the fast travel while 'over loaded' why not tie that to max rank Strong Back, and reduce Strong Back from 5 points (seriously, 1 perk card point for the effect of a mod on armor is absurd) to 3 points, but the maxed version gives you that 'fast travel while over loaded'
---
On Companion Animals: yes, I'd love this, doubly so if it was for 'tamed' animals we had, I'd love to tame a Hermit Crab and have it be a ridable 'camper transport' for salvage/trade runs, it'd be pretty awesome imo (plus they are oddly cute in their own crabby ways, would much rather be able to tame a pet honeyed beast though, if I could cure it's hive back issue and make it super fuzzy/adorable)
---
I bought the sitting pose because it was cheap. I also bought the cheapest wood floor, the succulents, the fishbowl lamp, and the white string lights with atoms I earned because I liked to decorate and they seemed like a decent value. (There's a lot of plant options and the fish lamp is animated.)
---
I really wanted the christmas tree set, but 10-12 seemee WAY too expensive for a seasonal decoration.
---
All platforms. :(
---
An excellent choice.
---
"Green Rolling Hills," "Fire in the Hole," "Which Side Are You On," "Lawrence Jones," "The L&amp;N Don't Stop Here Anymore," "Joe Hill," "Black Lung," "Talking Union," "You'll Never Leave Harlan Alive" (Kentucky, but still fits), "Red-Winged Blackbird," "Solidarity Forever," "One Day More" ... there's a lot to work with.
---
I probably have 100+ treasure maps sitting in my inventory since I never thought they were worth doing. Wonder if they will get some love
---
People are really going to complain about bethesda not patching enough and now "give me more than 15 minutes notice when you're going to take the game down"  
---
I want this bug fixed ASAP. It should've been fixed hours ago. Having to get off "in 15 minutes" is the least of problems. Literally everyone on my discord server cheered when they tweeted maintenance soon. It's not like nobody expected them to patch it today.
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Yeah this level is a bore. Out of quests and can't really find any good grinding areas. Currently taking out mole men in the big mining area. Seems to be an ammo sink though plus kind of sporadic spawns 
---
Sometimes I strip my X-01 back down to the default steel just so I can blackbird paint it all over again.
---
Actually, if you RP as a Raider in full out fashion it would make way more sense. If someone is fucking with you but RPing as a Raider at least it lends to some type of story and not just trying to be a dick. I'm not anti-PVP, I'm anti-peoplebeingdicksbecausetheyarebored. Bethesda obviously didn't give the PVP side enough thought before putting the game out. You spent your money on the game the same that everyone else did so how you play is up to you.
---
P.S. - If you RP as a Raider but add some crazy accent that would make it 100% better.
---
Yep especially if you end up fighting two at once
---
Had no perks except the 5 demo.
---
Is there a confirmed patch date? I’m just curious since you mentioned the end of the month.
---
Now imagine it without micro transactions or server down time or instability coz why not, let's dream!
---
Making a tweet or quick post to reddit is much quicker than updating an in game announcement feature. Some people also have jobs and can't sit home all day playing. 
---
 For this reason, news typically goes to a media that will much easier reach the masses. You can refuse to check reddit/twitter, knowing that's where the news goes first, but don't blame Bethesda when you find out too late.
---
Then I'll ask, would you mind sharing? :D
---
It will be fixed in the next update dude 
---
Really? I've been running that place a lot and most of the legendaries I get are useless armor pieces. :(
---
Go to whitespring, get a train of charred ghouls chasing you, shoot each one once, run into the swarm of robots guarding the front entrance, enjoy 1000xp. 
---
Unarmed is good partially because of the armor arm mod that adds unarmed damage and the talons mutation. Because of this unarmed is the strongest damage build in the game. 2h can replicate everything in that build with gear/perks except those two things so it falls a bit short.
---
To add some the would be nice;
---
"Sorry."
---
"Help me."
---
"Need help?"
---
"Do you have a mic?"
---
"Switch to area chat."
---
I can’t tell if you’re joking.
---
Let's hope it's worth it :p It's an immersive game, somehow    
---
For me the big factor was that outside of melee spec, which gets most of its meat in lvl 5-20, most other weapons don't get their good stuff until lvl 30+. Heck, heavy guns don't exist until lvl 20, and your first heavy gun perk is lvl 30. And things really pick up by late 30s, because you unlock the functionality by then.
---
Really? That's weird for me as when I bought the paint and then attempted to paint my pieces. It would pop up "placing a paint destroys current mod, still continue?" Or something similar so I was too scared to actually try. 
---
Yeah for sure. I’ll get around to them someday. I heard plans are decent drops from them. 
---
wanna see the playerbase vanish?  pull that shit
---
Better then dysentery I guess XD
---
Just found the mod for excavator right b4 servers went down . Can't wait to put it on and see what you're talking about.
---
This list is absolutely fantastic, and I really hope Beth takes it to heart. The community really wants to help make this the great game that it can be, let's just hope they are on board to listen to the community's feedback.
---
Great work!
---
how do we even know thats the common cause??? right now im literally standing next to a guy who said hes duping a whole bunch of shit and i still have yet to be disconnected. from what i can tell the servers have been shit from the start for everyone.
---
No. You missed it. Keep Limited time cosmetics limited. 
---
Well thats a bummer, wanted to get in some time before work. Aw well, appreciate the answers guys. 
---
Yeah people keep bringing up QA but I'm pretty sure QA people are supposed to work before the game is released.
---
I'd be far more understanding if this game released in April, but its release clearly wanted to take advantage of Thanksgiving and Christmas sales. Any company releasing an online-only game in that timeframe should know this and plan properly, especially when the launch has been as fucked up as with FO76.
---
I was doing the Power Poisden Energy Plant event when it happened.  The event was 2 mins from completion when the server shut and there were one or two repairs I couldn't find to clock it by completing the repairs. I noticed the plant had a strange blue pixel glitch happening that is not an actual game glitch, I can found two places where it will constantly appear, I kind of mapped it by moving around, it seems to form a 4-box window.
---
Bethesda using mackelmore’s definition of treasure  I see

I guess the point of divergence is 1769 now

I'll add you when I get home tonight, I'm always down for a good nuke!

Yeah I can't do shit with my guns...can I melee with 9 str but only 2 end?
---
How much for the cultist blade?
---
I shot the vendoooooor, but I did not shoot the MooMoo Cow...
---
I use an instigating grognak's, and just had a weird experience where I one shot two ghouls at the same time with one swing -- the legendary ghoul dropped almost nothing, and the regular ghoul had a ton of loot including a 2 star, as if the server just dumped everything on him.  I'm level 116 and feel like I understand this combat system less than when I started.

I think the most interesting visual bug is when my brother charges his Tesla shotgun. His character seems to turn into a pile of junk until he fires.

---
go fuck off 
---
I do a similar thing with my Mr Handy blade. Just run through the crowd going ZZZZZZZZZ and then either switch to my 1 shot War Drum or let other people finish the job.
---
If I get insects or molerats one more damn time.... 
---
I am aware, thanks.  8x lead = 21x .308 rounds, so those extractors are just one way but you need multiple sources.  A mag of 75 rounds can be gone in aboooout 2 seconds with this gun.
---
Dude, duping causes lag and server crashes. They do actually impact everybody's enjoyment directly. 
---
Perhaps you meant some of this list as pre-50 issues?
---
&gt; Ballistic Fiber either needs to be more plentiful, or needed less for Armor repairs.
---
&gt; Change the cost of repair for armor. It's cheaper to craft from scratch.
---
&gt; Repairs the entire repair system is way off balance, it is WAY too expensive and not advantageous to repair gear right now.
---
These are largely fixed once you hit end game (extra perk cards) and can pick up White Knight, Fix It Good, Weapon Artisan, Gunsmith/Makeshift Warrior, and Power Patcher.
---
Armor then takes a single ballistic fiber to repair, and you'll want to repair instead of replace because of legendary modifiers and/or rare power armor mods. Regular armor even gets a ballistic resistance bonus when it's over 100% durability.
---
If you meant repairing is too expensive and items break too fast *without these perks* (and especially at lower levels), then fair enough, but that's not clear.
---
&gt; Hunger and Thirst tone these down by 40 to 50%, it is WAY too high right now. I shouldnt have to drink 5 bottles of water after playing for an hour. Also reduce spoilage by at least the same amount, If I make 4 deathclaw steaks when I log in, they shouldnt be bad after a 3 hour play session.
---
Thirst is always trivial due to boiled water's availability, but swapping in cola nut lets you get 45% hydration from a single nuka-cola. Because I'm too lazy to swap perks, I instead use the purified water from my two small camp purifiers. Typically have to drop extra water. Hunger is also trivial once you have good doggy, I have to leave or throw away dog food frequently.
---
Spoilage rate is fair though, even though there's technically a perk for that. There are technically perks to help all these issues, they're just completely unnecessary *and* feel bad to take.
---
If they make the system even more incidental, they might as well just remove food and spoilage from the game and just keep well-fed/hydrated and food buffs. To be fair, I'm not against that idea, at least then I could drop thru-hiker.
---
Call down man lol, hot means fast, nowhere does that mean while servers are live.  There is server side and client side hot fixes, this one is server side therefore servers go down.
---
Yah they could have announced it sooner but it's not a huge deal and happens often in mmos with short notice.  Now if it takes 12 hours....by all means be pissed off.  Its not like you were in the middle of a queen fight......since her ass wouldnt have spawned with no dam nukes anyways lol.
---
The only time I did that event all I got was normal variant mirelurks. No king/queen/hunter ever spawned. I think it was somewhere from 6 to 10 mirelurks total I had to kill
---
Nuke silo fix.
---
Look at that fucking 16 times the detail! Amazing!
---
2 thumbs up!
---
I have done it about ~100 times.  Heaps of servo plans, an occasional rusty knuckles.  I think I'm done with it :(
---
Is your sniper rifle up to your level? Do you have damage perks? 1 point in the adrenaline perk does wonders. Use chems for a dmg boost VS harder enemies. Try avoiding the savage divide for a bit longer. Enemies can get high level there if high level players are around. Explore. Craft. Trade. Have fun :) 
---
What? If the in-game announcement feature takes more time to use than Twitter then its not a feature.
---
Tag ‘em and bag ‘em
---
The only way I got it was by saving up from the beta which was most o the early stuff you could unlock.
---
I have maxed out Perception and have never seen the counter more than 100 meters. Also, I'm almost positive that whenever I'm in power armor I still have the distance counter. 
---
I'm starting up a Witcher 3 replay this year, including the expansions.
---
"Put", not "Buy".
---
And yes, what's the point in producing a fix for a 1 hour slimer bashing fest (you know that's what nukes currently are, right?) when you can be happily ignoring rampant duping.
---
You think I'm entitled? No. I am not one of the refund bitches.
---
I love this franchise and want it to succeed.
---
Christ. I should have bought that jetpack the one time I saw one.
---
Honestly when i see posts like this i think maybe one day capitalism will finally die. 
---
Yeah I remember mid 20s just always starving and being dehydrated. I pretty much stayed in the forest and did events there until lvl 45. The map is so big I was in no rush to hit the east part (the mire and the bog). 
---
I made my camp mobile so I could take it anywhere I needed (helps big time when a lower level).
---
Nuke silos are bugged, I was wondering why I couldn't do quests to get the keycards.
---
It's not just shotguns, it is everything. Gauss rifles are the worst because I get the hit indicator on my crosshairs but it doesn't register as a hit.
---
Sure, personally I always have t2 of that card equipped and its noticeable on the condition. Plus repairing only costs 2 fibers with the t2. Of course if it is not a legendary armor piece scrapping and crafting is the better option.
---
Especially since there's that bed when you make a new character with a backpack on it and when leaving the vault you pick up a backpack full of supplies to get started building up your CAMP... :(
---
Interiors really need to be affected to make nuke zones more interesting.
---
Wendigo cave would be interesting then
---
They're not quite as bad as the strangler blooms for the other recipe. Haven't seen one of those since I did the quest for radshield. My luck is maxed but I hate swapping perks just to search containers, just gonna keep enduring my diseases!
---
Thats fine.  Rdr2 is every 7 to 10 minutes nonstop.  Im afraid if i keep playing it i may lose a controller or my tv.  Its really nerve racking.  I like my tv.
---
If I send you my PayPal will you refund my $60 purchase?
---
I sent you the discord link in PM ;)
---
T60 legs are the best, easy to maintain, easy to get mods for (2 vendors in Watoga sell them, so you have double chances per jump, triple if you include a hop to Harpers Ferry).
---
Here's the 'fastest' way to obtain Excavator, T60, T51, T45 mods from the vendors, you will need a friend, it's best if you're both Mayors of Watoga.
---
Have one friend setup camp near Harpers Ferry, across the river works well, one near Watoga Train station.
---
Search Wallace (Harper's Ferry), camp hop south then to Watoga Train Station and then to Phoenix (BoS vendor in the shopping mall).
---
One friend stays on then the other logs in and rejoins the same game. This way, Harper's Ferry stays clear and you can get through faster. Take turns logging in and out of the same game to refresh your vendor lists. 
---
It's just a few resources to repair it. With inventory issues it could even be a positive to have something to spend those accumulating resources on, in the event some poor deranged individual comes upon your CAMP.
---
I haven't moved it since I built it.  Thinking about relocating closer to Watoga - doubt it will port over and I'll probably have to rebuild.

The riot gear was designed for - and used by - the LAPD, but I suppose it's not too much of a stretch to say that some sets were shipped to Appalachia for the Welch riots. That said, some of the iconic aspects of the NCR ranger &amp; riot armors were additions made by the rangers themselves, such as the duster and jeans. I can't recall in-game dialogue/text to confirm this, but it seems odd that those would be part of the pre-war LAPD riot control uniform. Sadly, I don't think there's a snowball's chance that Bethesda would add riot gear, but even if they did, it would be pretty inexplicable if they included that glorious duster so far ahead of the advent of the NCR. Of course, I'd still hurl my money at a set of that armor.
---
Sweet :)
---
Sent you the discord address as well :)
---
Some are specific, some are random. For example, the Powering Up events will always reward you with a generator plan until you have them all. I don't know what it drops after that since I stopped running it after I pulled the Fusion gen, but that's one example any way.
---
It's referring to the current paint. It does overwrite the paint slot, but other slots should be fine.
---
Were not your friend pal....
---
Who the f am I kidding I'll be your friend and pal if your on ps4 hit me up I'll give you free recipes lol.
---
I just hate exploring so much with no quests or real rewards. 
---
I just did earlier lol, level 25
---
And a way to see what mods and plans you already have so you dont buy the same one at the vendor 
---
Thats the interior sides of the brick walls

I love cannibal. I have rank 2 of this and 2 lead belly and I don't get many rads. The little burp at the end is priceless

Centuries later, civilization, in its death wails, will create a brothel in which you may be fisted by a robot.
---
I believe they will never fully fix all the glitches around duping. It’s like a bubble in wallpaper. They will patch it and in less than 24 hours someone will find another way 
---
I haven't taken the time to read this entire wall of text but I think it's important to point out automatic melee weapons and not currently useless, just gimmicky.
---
Repaired to 200% condition, they're some of the best damage in the game. But it doesn't last long.
---
I keep a regular TS or just a Explosive Combat Shotgun for events and I just take them then work on adds. Everyone else should follow suite. 
---
I have ported hardened sniper, 60ish damage I think. 
---
Yehh rub it in 😂
---
There have been a number of reports that shop structures add to the instability. Also crafting a large # of items at once.
---
Thanks for the clarification

&gt;Will be playing all day starting about 20 minutes after this post.

---
I'm at 113, not see him since before 100 when I used to see him often
---
I think it's because I'm not exploring like before 
---
Appreciated, but it smells of "quick little fix will band-aid most complainers".
---
Lol that's gold
---
From what I have seen in this game. Watch out for that hammer she is holding.
---
My camp is across from Southern Belle Motel and I see radtoads, super mutants, cave crickets and even a foursome of radiscorpions showed up once. 
---
It’s much nicer than constantly being attacked by level 1 ghouls, scorched and moles. 
---
Not sure. No one seems to be sure. So I’m taking this opportunity to get my new headset working. I’m level 53 by the way. 
---
It looks like a lot of people are going to try dropping nukes today after they become available again so I’m probably going to that when I can
---
Easiest to obtain shocks are T51b from a power armor crafter. No server hops, no rng. Just bring your mats and come get your shocks :) 
---
Yes PLEASE! Makes it really frustrating when I have more than one power armor set on me. 
---
Oh. I had no idea there was such an issue with the reloading getting *interrupted* \- from the way it was worded, I'd kinda just assumed it was a complaint about the speed. But that? Yeah, that definitely needs fixed.
---
Lever actions: Meh, fair enough.
---
Bodies: That's a good point - I suppose I've never actually yet encountered a situation like that with enough bodies for it to be an issue! A thought, though - if they'd restore the ability to pick up/drag world items (including bodies), that would certainly help with this, wouldn't it? While also allowing for fun random nonsense like chucking things off of mountains and what have you... maybe add that to the list, if it isn't already? :P
---
No where not dupers when you find a 2-3 star legendary it's not going to say explosive gun its going to have another name like medic auto pistol. Not once has a gun name started with explosive... you know you need to inspect them you may have found one but drop it I found an explosive harpoon gun when I was a lvl 28. Your just not looking good enough(I'm just tired of people calling everyone dupers) so look at what you get and don't throw it away so easy.
---
Idk. It's nice to have things for 5k or less since that's the max we can trade at a time. Prior to the dupe some guns were trading for over what you could have on one character. Like I'm not condoning the dupes, but let's not pretend we would have a "nice" economy. Almost everything about the games trading system is messed up right now. 
---
There's a point in her quest where she admits she's really coming along to liking you. I kinda paused the main quest for a couple of weeks, and would login to that voice line every session. &lt;3 you too Rose
---
I may have to do that. Its bugging me.
---
Hahaha yeah I found out on a very unhappy behemoth....
---
Meat piles in close proximity should be consolidated into one. Was doing One Violent Night earlier and there were so many meat piles overlapping I couldn't get at some of them.
---
Why complain over a gun if you’re not using it? There’s melee builds that are far more op than TSE. The guns are useless without the build. ANY build can be op in this game if you know how to play the game and use the perk cards to your benefit. You can one shot enemies with ANY gun if your build is done properly. Why do you think I run a low hp build? For the simple fact on a non explosive build you can easily break 500 damage, and easily break 1500 damage with a dragon. Bloodied melee builds with increase swing speed can break 3-5k+ dmg easily per swing and swing ridiculously fast with the right perks and mutations. I didn’t get my first explosive weapon until 120ish. You can’t use an argument that they’re op just because you haven’t gotten one as a drop. I could complain melee is op because I haven’t managed to get a bloodied increase swing speed melee weapon yet, and every time I go to kill the scorch queen they’re 5 hitting it. But where would my arguement be? Because they’re op and have the better build/weapon? Understandably duping is allowing people to get the guns at a faster rate but there are multiple websites you can buy these guns for real money as well. At the end of the day unless they’re going to nerf every weapon and every build, that’s not a valid arguement. Then people will complain they’re lvl 100+ getting killed by the max lvl mobs that are 50-20 lvls lower than they are. How does that seem proper? So if we are going after explosives, let’s target nerd rage, Arsenal mutation, demolition expert, strange in numbers, bloodied, mutants, all of the things that play a key role into breaking that high dmg that you’re complaining about. 
---
Because you don't haaavvveee ooonnneeee. Well, you do, but it's not a good one. You think people should play the game a certain way and they don't. You don't like that. 
---
Before 12pm? After I didnt see any, but maybe was just luck of the draw.  Usually see quite a few.
---
I do agree with this. The trade UI is a horror, and the cap limits make no sense. But I am hoping that the forward moves will solve at least some of this. (Player vendors next patch!)
---
When Lag happens you see a lot of funky stuff, i play with some one 1600 miles away, if i join their session, funky stuff happens on my end. 
---
They usually take at least a couple of hours.
---
As opposed to 76 where it feels empty from the start?
---
First off - look at the quality of this game.
---
Then consider just how complex the task is to write and test client code and server code to fix the issue – while part of it being a technique to save your character from losing all their shit in the first place (rolling back on a disconnect). You can't save state on a disconnect, you've been disconnected. You have to revert to the last good state save for the character.
---
Then there's some bullshit logic error causing the items in your camp to be stashed twice. Which is weird but can be exploited and what do you know loot bags work too? Loot bags should be easily fixable, but again there's a lot that has to go on to code, deploy, test, repeat. 
---
And it's the holiday season.
---
And between you and me - point #1 above bro. Have you ever been to Maryland? We visited one time for a conference and every morning we woke up the first thing we would listen to is the kill count on the morning news. By the end of the week I think they had 10 murders. These mother fuckers are dealing with real Fallout over there, while making a game about it.
---
So if other games don't crash a console, and this one does it's the consules fault?
---
Also you might want to look at the post history for the op, they are a fan. It's pretty funny how fast people will turn on those who like the game and then got frustrated with it.
---
Maybe this is a vault experiment to create a group of people who will attack anyone who doesn't conform to their World view, including those who previously conformed to their worldview.
---
Gatling's more ammo efficient than the minigun. I currently have a 3 star one made for VATS and two shot.
---
Plus 5mm isn't too hard to craft
---
Yeah, I've ran into the dog walker bot a couple of times in other locations.  I've only seen the pied piper bot there.
---
its just a path he walks, I don't have the link but just search this subreddit and you should find it
---
just confirmed places he has been seen
---
My Mrs who plays with me hates the burp. (I secretly love it too) 🤣
---
Reddit bans? What's the point you can just make a new account doesn't even need an email.
---
I'm telling you starting our own legit community is the only real option based out of reality.
---
It'd be fine if they'd just make like a special welcome mat that would draw in NPC traders. 
---
I'll have a look, thanks for the feedback
---
You don’t like playing guess that power armor.
---
I've been in a few nuke zones and taken out a SBQ but have never launched one myself.  I'm gonna do a bit of work around my house then check on 76 in about 20 more minutes.  I'll PM my beth.net name if you still wanna team up when the servers come back

Economies in MMORPGs are always a joke. People get greedy, RMT value, Farmers break cash sinks, and The games are left with inflation / broken economies. I think the dupers aren't a problem. It keeps the process slow because how can their be demands when everyone's got massive amount of the same item.  The caps are set at like 25k so they were intentionally gimping the market so it didn't become wealth focused. The dupers are the black market and is really a perfect  " correction" here's some articles about MMORPG economies and the issues I discussed so you know I'm not full of it :

That's only 3 articles discussing the problems and Dynamics of the genres economy. if the game is popular they break or the developer has to invent time sinks and other frustrating mechanics to slow down the ability to get currency and then you just have auction houses to stare at but you can't ever buy anything. They are a game within themselves but who cares about dupers. You can kill them with crafted gear. It's not game breaking your just complaining because you think that's a good point. It's not. Nukes are a key mechanic if people want to trade they trade. It seems to encourage interaction by forcing players to randomly trade with each other rather than trying to play this game anti-socially and ignoring everyone and wondering why it feels hollow. Is designed to be a group activity. Work work players or kill them; Don't like those options? Go play fallout 4 or wait for fallout 5. We all knew what we signed up for if we read carefully. This game is fun and unlike others in that is fallout- online! Maybe this game isn't for you. I heard Battlefield had a good story and you can blow up stuff and compete- go play that instead.
---
Who does
---
Praise geraldo
---
It wouldn't be that big of a problem if suddenly you didn't have to deal with mobs like 3 times your own level because some high level character triggered the spawn previously.
---
New Vegas != Bethesda
---
I have seen people snap walls to the sides.
---
I agree with the agility bloat.  Competition is fierce there.  I can’t even imagine maxing out the damage perks as it is now. 
---
Idk but if you’re in power armor it seems to always work instantly for some reason.
---
So, it's 200,000 now?
---
What happened 2,000?
---
You're so right, because something taking longer than YOU want it to take means it's no longer a feature. The entitlement is strong with you lol.
---
Who was Feed the People a problem for? Or limb mods being able to be used twice if used in the same crafting session? Etc. These are "fixes" nobody asked for, that detract from the user experience.
---
if this irritates you, I'd hate to see what you're like when faced with an actual problem 
---
That explains why there are no children in this particular game - the responders refused to pay the P.P. Bot XD
---
Thank you :)
---
It's not just the duping. Too many unique items in a player's inventory, IE stuff that doesn't stack like ammo, scrapped junk or grenades, causing excessive databasing by the server to bring up that player's inventory that causes lag.
---
If that wasn't an issue we wouldn't have stash limitations. 
---
The act of duping also commonly causes a crash because you're actively screwing up the data in the weird way. I've had too many times when the server was acting fine, when performance was hardly different from a single player game, only to be abruptly disconnected out of the blue. That means someone duped and caused a server crash.
---
Perked Melee with Mutations is certainly OP when it comes to this, at 40 I'd one-shot my way through an entire crowd of level 65+ mob, or a Scorchbeast whenever I can get them to land. Explosive shotgun builds are even more insane.
---
I feel like the mob need more balancing for +/- level.
---
I saw a shotgun barrel for it the other day, does that still chain nicely? I hope so.
---
It may be boring to you but its worth it in the long run, IMO. That time frame is a rough estimate to acquire different kinds of foods which includes the ones that give xp buffs. Canned stew gives +5, cranberry juice gives +2 and cranberry cobbler provide an additional  +5, all of which stack. You get xp from cooking the food, and if you are adding hunting or the Mama Dolce event you also get xp from that. 
---
Then you go out and do quests and explore and are earning bonus xp for literally everything you're doing in that time period plus you have a good stock of healing and buff items + food/drink. If you have Good with Salt equipped the food lasts for a long time too. 👍
---
Met him 4 times before 100.  Once at Whitesprings doing a Nuke, he was talking to Moo Moo as he walked right through. When I shouted out. So funny watching all players forget about Glowies and form an orderly queue.
---
Then 6 times after at 100, difference for me was playing in a team that was spread out doing different things.  One was on his 2nd character LVL 12 and staying around workshops, he called him out 3 times (and still made 100 Fancy Snack Cakes lol).  He gets around so it's just down to luck I guess.  Good luck to you from me👍
---
Dear Bethesda, remove vats in PVE it is useless and PVP it’s borderline the most game breaking mechanic there is. I think it adds such an unfair advantage that it ruins fluid PVP. 
---
"All the glitches" it's been pretty much the same method of crafting and dropping, with some.modifications or extra steps (using open world container instead of artillery,   weapons instead of armor, drop at 255 boards and make more) 
---
I'm sure another way to dupe will come out when they deal with the root of this issue, but they need to destroy this method first. 
---
Right now there's a mod on pc that apparently makes it so you save more often, and it makes the current method useless. A mod fixed the duping issue and it wasn't even meant to do so. 
---
That's odd. I've never experienced that but it isn't surprising.
---
Good point, my 2000+ 5mm and 0.2lb gatling are just too fun.
---
Current weight leaving camp is:
---
89/260
---
Pending calibrated shocks or 89/360 w/excavator. 
---
Why would I disagree with that? It's sense.
---
You may be under the impression that I'm trolling, but I'm not.
---
I just don't like being called "dude". DUDE.
---
Can confirm too, though I thought I’d stolen the key card from the player who did all the work.  (I ran away doing the zoidberg noise)
---
Nice to know it’s there for all players.
---
Thats awesome.
---
TIL there are “animated perk cards” 
---
If you open up the link I've got a second pic of the interior
---
I was in the same boat until yesterday. I'm level 96 and he had nothing good for me
---
I agree. 
---
When did all the maintenance start? Just got back from taking my family to disney. Was pumped to play after a few day and boom maintenance:( 
---
Low on food and water?  Equip Can Collector and the black/gold bins inside Whitesping can be searched.  A simple run through of the main building can yield lots of food and canned coffee!
---
Have not tried that. I farmed a charging lob barrel. Junk. 
---
Yeah, can't use one mid swing either. It's a pain in the arse. Only time I use them is when I'm surrounded by ghouls or stuff in serious battle. I have to jump or back away for a moment to use them.
---
Yes I got it that way. 
---
Check your notes and read the plans you found
---
maybe someone at bethesda took too many at new years party and fucked up something relating to nukes. and now they try to fix it, but obviously nobody remembers anything
---
Attaching a mod never needs materials. It might say it does but it never does
---
Bring back the Blitz perk. it was one of my favorites. Fits great with Ninja.
---
Why does Ninja only affect SA damage with melee? What about suppressed guns? They are now Mister Sandman which is totally different now. MS is supposed to auto-kill sleeping enemies. Now it increases SA damage from silenced weapons. I am actually good with that but you also made it ONLY at night. WTF! 
---
Make enemy bodies group loot, like ESO does. This way we do not have to find each thing if they die close to each other.
---
I've seen two rad storms since launch, and it rains about 50% of the time for me.
---
Yet again, never said that either. As far as entitlement goes - if you truly can't see how your attitude that they should have warned YOU first (rather than jumping on rolling out the hotfix the moment it left QA) is the definition if entitlement, then my fears that I'm now arguing with a 7 year old have been confirmed. My original point still stands. Chill out and stop being so angry at the world. No one owes you anything.
---
I liked the suicidal miss Nanny. Sad though.
---
i would recommend just buying anything you know you dont have. power armor mod plans are extremely rare, so buy those if you see them (except for motion-assist servos, you find plenty of those out in the wild). weapon plans are relatively rare, too. the charleston vendor is guaranteed to have those two plans and they are unique to him, so get them the first time you see him. I've only seen grahm a few times but I do recall that he has some relatively rare plans...iirc only the powered door plans are unique to him though
---
There is both rad storms and rainstorms.
---
Rare-ish, but they do exist.
---
Same here. Never seen one
---
Lol wow that is one awesome shortcut 
---
I'm camped on his route and he consistently appears in the same area for me. Road between the back of the water purifier place and up towards the top of the world from there. Good luck.
---
I've only played for a few weeks and I can say that I only remember encountering rain two times. For a total of about maybe 20 minutes. Maybe it is just rare.
---
It is the cool thing to hate, otherwise people would be trashing RDR2's online mode for being pure pay 2 win bullshit, but its not cool to hate on rockstar.
---
Sure guy. People can play however they want, and I am one those who depends on Nickaroo93 for codes. My point is simply thing, at some point the guys who have been getting the codes are going to stop playing meaning.....you have to figure it out on your then. But alright, random Reddit tough guy text screaming at me through the Internet, keep being a twit
---
Also it does not show what any of the items are.. just where something might be.
---
Its because the Stimpak use animation takes time and must run for the effect. However there is no power armor stim animation so if you are wearing PA you use stims immediately. 
---
In a few months there'll be no fucking players left and the game will be an abandoned wilderness.
---
Do you think that Beth/BSG/Zeni will continue to fund a dud??
---
&gt; Corpses after being looted, corpses should be deleted from the client view.
---
Only if they're completely looted. If I look at it for a second and walk away, don't delete it on me.
---
You don't need any materials to add a mod to anything. It will say it does but you can just go ahead and attach it :|
---
I really hope a fix comes for this soon, but a lot of other issues are getting way more attention.
---
It's the first FO to be multiplayer, except I can't play with any of my friends. It's the whole point of the game, but is completely non functional... ? How is this not a priority?
---
Good stuff! And gatlings are fun af
---
Thank u!
---
I'm entitled because I can express my disappointment and valid criticism about this game, its release and the poor strategy Bethesda has adopted?
---
Why are you mad at me then, if I'm entitled? Sounds like you want everyone to meet your level of expectations and be unable to express anything except blind positivity. That's pretty entitled.
---
I’m still getting used to living at low HP so VATS was supposed to assist me in that ;(
---
My understanding is the root issue is the save mechanism and capturing progress items before you exit. Is that correct?
---
Ign Zorex12 however I won't be on until after 9 PM est.
---
Ok but the average player can have an assload of unique items without duping. Notes and holos alone can really stack up. I've noticed better performance since I started stashing all of them.
---
Disconnecting doesn't mean someone duped. We don't know why (specifically) we have stash limitations. All of your opinions are based on rumors. 
---
Well, that's only twice what a fat man with max demolition expert does. The reload speed is atrocious, and that damage is only assuming that you hit them with all your pellets (which is unlikely since you need to be far away enough to not kill yourself with the explosion). If you have a hardened receiver handmade, which I think comes out to around 103 damage per shot, you will have a much higher dps than a two shot explosive dragon
---
The counter starts at 100 no matter your perception, objects pop in further away than that if you have a higher perception. 
---
Same for rain, I've seen 1 rad storm and it lasted about 3 irl minutes out at the Morgantown airport.
---
Love the game myself stream it usually daily if I feel well.
---
Dude you killed his beloved pet snuggles!
---
I’d kill you too you monster.
---
Snuggles just likes to gives kisses 
---
I found 5 jetpacks before my 2nd shock, but didn't think to track number of server hops
---
You can QA something to death, until it is live in the hands of customers there is no way to entirely know how it's going to to fuck up. Also, the game is a non-critical service, lives aren't at stake if we can't launch a nuke for 48 hours and farm legendaries. Developers, PM, QA, etc are human beings too and deserve holidays off just as you do. I don't mean disrespect, but this sounds like complaints of somebody entitled that everything and everyone should bend to YOUR needs...
---
Its all good.  We need solidarity (and validation) right now not people dismissing us and since I am emotionally invested It tends to be a provocative topic.
---
If you look through my post history you'll see I lost 2 same time, same day :) same issue apparently or the game state didn't sync to the server. Either way furious
---
mark down every recipe/plan you learn
---
had two rad storms 30secs each and rain for 7hrs at one point.
---
Thanks for this, I figured how I could place them side by side but not snap stack them.
---
Does an atomic shop skin take up a star slot? If so, I'd think a 5\* legendary is a 3-effect, 1 atomic shop, 1 prime/scorched receiver modded item.
---
I gave up with vats. Its bugged too often and i cant hit the enemy in front of me or vats is selecting the wrong enemy. On low action points i can still attack without vats but because vats itself consumes ap i can't use it
---
Oh ok that makes much more sense. Thank You
---
I got home right at 2:30, I only have a couple of hours to play before I have to go out again.. and I discover this.  
---
isn't the definition of a hot fix that is is applied "hot"? that you don't have to take the servers down?
---
I'm level 90 and have not got the starched genes perk card. Will I ever get it ?
---
Sounds good random Reddit guy who hasn’t had a valid point in the post yet
---
I agree that if there's nothing else for me to do, that if I was just being a dick it would be fucked. I'll dress up in Raider garb and switch my mic on for *muh immerzion* so at least it makes sense. There's a "new PvP mode" coming out in the next patch or two, so hopefully that'll give us something to do.
---
Are you seriously suggesting that this $60 premium-priced product launched in a state that had any sufficient amount of QA done to it?
---
I'm not talking about nukes or duping even, the entire game has been a shitshow from day 1 and it's very fair and reasonable to suggest there was very little QA done.
---
Rose is that bitch, but my heart belongs to Grahm.
---
I'm really happy about it - it's reproducible almost every time in that room, and it skips the one part I hate about silos - the stupid laggy mainframe cores. 
---
Pretty much. 
---
If you have the carnivore perk you can't get diseases from eating corpses with cannibal.
---
The three together are truly a useful combination.
---
&gt; if you have multiple copies of the same treasure map in your inventory, you can loot the mound multiple times without relogging or walking away.
---
I tested this two days ago. I had two maps in my inventory, clicked the mound once, and they both disappeared.
---
The reason I tested this specifically is that I had a feeling it had happened other times.
---
I'm not sure the assertion in the quote is true.
---
It also happens on PS4. Was playing earlier this day and noticed it when I saw a group of high level players on the map. I wanted to check their levels and two of them were between lvl 100 and 110 because all I saw was 10 and then maybe a 2 or 3 pixel column of the third digit. 
---

Exactly what put me off a pistol build - I did some quick counting and realized I could combine rifles &amp; sneak but not pistols and sneak so goodbye pistols. They'd be better off in the (P) stack or even (I)
---
been almost an hour
---
This is a great idea if they would implement a damage causing penalty.  There are too many griefers out there that just like to wreck people's camps.  
---
Amen. I wore a patched three-piece suit and a bowler hat and it didn’t count as formal wear. When they had a “level up while wearing a costume and mask” challenge I wore the halloween skeleton costume and mask set and it didn’t count. It’s hardly worth trying to figure out what they mean anymore.
---
Nice man! Like the exterior look.
---
if you're real lucky you'll get the power armor bug where your character model stretches itself to match your power armors dimensions, it is the funniest thing I have seen out of this game yet 
---
My bad, I read the sub and nothing told me. My apologies 
---
Unarmed is EXTREMELY powerful, and it’s only fair that it’s not in power armor. 800 per shot at high health is enough to one tap huge creatures and bash down SB alike.
---
A server run by a gaming community instead of bethesda.  Basically private servers.
---
Right now it only shows a colour marker for each item, I need to add labels under them. Lots of work to do :)
---
i dropped my legendary lever action rifle by mistake today
---
gone but not forgotten :'(
---
Blank Holotapes are easy to get and have no weight. They make a great first thing to drop to spawn a paper bag and if it doesn't spawn no great loss.
---
Nah, he's a horarder like me and bulked all his shit to slowly sell it to vendors. Also probably had lvl 3 pack rat, so to him it may have only been a few lbs of junk. And his stash is full, so he has no other options. 
---
If someone was able to steal my food, they would probably wonder why I'm carrying 100lbs in food, when really it's only 10lbs.
---
I recently used some Unyielding armor to get bonus Charisma to buy some expensive serums. Though Grape Mentats are already giving you most of discount, but still, it saves some caps if you don't want to waste points on Charisma.
---
I also only recently found out that if you run out of Boiled water, you can simply tap (as fast as you want) any puddle or lake for dirty water and boil it. Water pumps are super slow and they irradiate you just the same.
---
Pro tips right here
---
&gt; a "Free! Take one!" box for our Camps or at red rocket stops
---
Better yet, add extra home storage in the form of player-lootable boxes.  An unlocked box would allow players to freely trade/giveaway items, while a locked box would give some incentive for homestead PVP.
---
If you want keyboard and mouse support buy a PC.
---
I've seen his pack mule dead, I wonder if he can be killed by scorch beasts and ergo not always spawned in the world.
---
Interiors are affected too. The Morgantown University was filled by glowing bloated ones when I nuked the town.
---
Are you sure crits automatically hit? I'm pretty sure they don't. I'm running base 15 luck with 3 crit savvy, better crit, and grim reapers. So, I have full crit meter all the time. It seems like i can miss after turning on crit and it gets used on the next hit.
---
Not blurry enough, lol jk. That's a sick looking picture
---
Have you ever tried to hold a mini gun? The Gatling plasma looks like a freaking plane engine. The broadsider is a 50 pound cannon. Shooting these accurately outside of a machine that gives you the strength of a Greek god doesn’t make sense in any way. Not only that but I don’t think anyone is using heavy guns besides power armor users anyway. They’re so underpowered you basically need the perks to make them competitive. 
---
If this game were more like ESO in every facet it would be better. That’s pretty much what I expected when I bought the game but unfortunately I was very wrong. I can’t believe they didn’t launch with faction based PVP incentives. 
---
Waves and thumbs up is all I do.
---
It's going to be interesting to see if they do manage to stop dupers and IF the server stability magically gets better, if not I'm going to seriously laugh my rear end off for a long time for the people on the side of the fence betting the whole pot on that.  
---
I really don't think dupers is going to make the disconnects/server crashes stop in a measurably better manner.  But I'm more than willing to be proven wrong on this topic and hopefully will be once they do address this stuff in earnest.  
---
I just restart/log back in with the disconnects as they come, I still have too much fun with the game despite that aspect of it.  Good luck to you peeps seeing the really bad D/C's hope it improves.
---
Shame they couldn't just dupe the servers
---
Unfortunately there is a long long way from Fallout 76 to ESO. I guess it would have been a better choice to copy the ESO code and make a Fallout of it instead of using Fallout 4.
---
I think this has something to do with Grahm somehow [pic](https://imgur.com/a/CwH3EX1)
---
They need to add a "Safe Zone" option for consoles. It's annoying not being able to see my water bar till it's half gone
---
Lost 20lbs by dropping my .38 and 10mm ammo alone :)
---
mark down every camp plan you learn, because the genious who decided not to specify C.A.M.P item names, did a really good job at it. gl finding out which plan you need for multiple objects of "chair", "bed", "table", "door". 
---
"Move CAMP module."
---
Slap on the super duper perk while crafting guns to scrap.
---
Nothing is better than getting 2 guns for the price of 1.
---
Sent! :)
---
I took off all of the mods that were on the bunker buster. Weights 20lb withput mods, if you dont want to throw it away atm
---
Sounds good to me! Lol Im running on ps4.

Just came here from the recent Mastzer List of QoL post.

---
Your work here is great, this post should not be that neglected.
---
Honestly without a doubt would of been great if they threw in at least one living person to throw you off and surprise you. Every time it tells me to find someone or find out what happened to them its like "huH i rEaLly wOnDer **whAt HaPpEnEd**"
---
Don’t stockpile weapons and armor that is 10+ levels above where you are at, it’s a waste of weight and you will most likely find a better upgrade down the line. That being said, save any weapon that has double shot, it’s worth holding onto IMHO.
---
Let me guess... you took the country roads back? :)
---
They existed in Fallout 4, and considering that they reuse a lot of assets it's most likely just an oversight. I mean we have drills under the legendary loot table, and they can't even *get* legendaries.
---
Nice! I’m gonna try it on my lower level character.
---
It is.
---
Please add energy weapon issues to this list, for example ashing enemys usually deletes all loot, energy weapons that should be amazing once fully modded out SUCK! ex: Alien blaster and the only mod to make it useful since there is no plan to craft alien ammo lowers its already pathetic damage ratio even further.
---
More useful Intelligence perk cards in general as a crafter the game forces me to max out int yet its useless outside of that and to add insult to injury i can't even craft weapons on par with even the worst legendarys :/
---
Towards the end of the main quest, you'll gain access to an additional vendor faction, which will also give you access to a decontamination shower for removing rads. You'll be passing by this decontamination shower each day when you go on your daily vendor route, so rad management outside of nuke zones becomes trivial. (Later on, you'll even get a plan for building your own decontamination shower in your CAMP as a guaranteed reward from the Scorched Earth event.)
---
&gt; If it went to the person whose stuff you ~~destroyed~~ accidentally shot once, maybe.  
---
I've run into him multiple times in one day. I see him the most in Flatwoods. Sometimes headed west, sometimes north. He was wearing the propane helnet today, when I first saw him, and Chally hadn't spawned in yet. 
---
Unsure if it’s fixed yet, but nukes are broken at the moment. The changeover from 2018-2019 presumably messed up the game clock and confused the weekly event. 
---
Servers are offline for a hotfix on the nuke silo issue
---
Ballistic fibre is at camp McLintock, the asylum, most military posts have one or two, a couple spread around watoga, and randomly in containers.
---
Adhesive is everywhere but it’s much easier to farm nutfruit, tatos and corn, set up a few purifiers and craft adhesive (use super duper), I have hundreds of adhesive.
---
Lead you can hit up the in game gyms for a large hit at once (Charleston fire department, that hotel in flat woods), farm robots at robco and watoga OR clean out lucky hole mine using excavator armour to get more lead from each ore vein.
---
Because they want you to think it's cool and want to buy it, simple
---
Servers down for a hotfix.
---
Yes!  Go into your PipBoy and use the junk tab to specifically mark what junk you need.  You get a little marker when looking at something that shows if it has what specific junk part you want in it.  Saves a ton of space.
---
Stop!  You look FABULOUS!

It's alright man, don't sweat people that would rather post hate than just ignore something and move on.

And/or retain the original name so someone can't dupe you in a trade for a falsely named item.

Hey, I feel you for sure. I've got a Furious Lever Action I'm not using. Its not 'splody or anything but if you want it, you can have it for free.
---
I thought I was lucky for one, 15 minutes later I popped another at the shop was like jackpot time to flip like 5k cap profit...NOPE :\
---
Good questiom.  Since launch i have had 4 or 5 Rad storms, but as I potter about in PA maybe I am less aware of the tick tick of the Rad counter now.  Wonder if the Seasons impact frequency.
---
It rained twice today but as the World is larger than F4 I think my fast travels left it behind.  Final thought is that when it rains I don't notice the same internal wet look that F4 had in CAMP/Settlement.  Sure I see the rain drops but just not as noticeable for me.
---
Why would you want another heavy weapon perk in strength? There are already more than you can take if you want to max out your build. All this would do is nerf heavy weapon builds. Thematically I think it makes sense to have intelligence buff PA, which is probably why that perk is where it is.
---
Ah.  Well no hope for that on PlayStation :(
---
Servers are down right now to hotfix the silos.
---
 The quest line is very deep. Its just not breadcrumbed like the single player games.
---
 The actual story is the best Fallout story so far, but many have no idea that it even exists.
---
I never saw him till 90(94 now).  i’ve run into him twice at sunshine meadows industrial farm west of flatwoods since. 
---
And what you get for your $60 is gameplay - which you have logged and will continue to log. Your $60 did not buy you the entitlement of a personal notification from Bethesda every time they implement a change, nor your input on how/when those changes should occur. That's what this entire exchange has been about. Yet you are so blinded by your temper tantrum that you fail to read and comprehend anything I say and revert to complaining about bugs, refunds, etc instead of addressing the real issue - that you are way too bent out of shape over the inadequate "warning" that you felt "entitled" to.
---
Dropping .38 in front of Vault 76 is very helpful to newbs
---
Oh thanks
---
how do you mean cheap now?  What changed ? Did i miss something?
---
Why didn't this have thousands of upvotes??
---
What platform are you on?
---
Silos are bugged at the moment
---
rad storms are less dangerous than nuke zones, so even if there is one inside a nuke zone, the nuke zone itself does more rad already, so pointless  
---
maybe if it stacks, but do we really want that in queen fights? 
---
Whitesprings, or maybe morgantown.
---
I did about 15 maps in one sitting, all I got was motion-assist torso mod for all the armor sets bar the X-01, bout 2-4 copies of each plan.
---
When hacking: I’m experiencing a consistent bug whereby selecting a “()[]” etc entry doesn’t actually remove a dud. The terminal will say “dud removed” but the dots representing remaining tries will not change and if you’re not paying close attention, you’ll get kicked out when you think you still have one+ tries remaining.
---
I think it explains this on the login screen..
---
for Ammo, I can understand your frustration, however, if I'm making something to vendor like an outfit, I craft slow and listen for the sound so that I can count correctly without backing out of the screen.
---
Ah, nice. I’ve been waiting to drop a fat ass nuke. 
---
Nice! Love all the powered stuff... where'd you find those powered doors??
---
When I read what they do I said to myself "I could swear that landing doesn't actually do any damage..."
---
I was right.
---
They are literally useless.
---
This game doodoo sometimes.
---
Yes thats majorily true; but we're talking in terms of Bethesda's standards, so. 
---
There is a lumber mill in the north west section of the forest, north of the fair grounds. 
---
It’s a super mutant base, tons of .308 ammo and hunting rifles to scrap for mods. And tons of screws, PA spawn point if that’s your thing. 
---
Also the Leader of the Pack event starts at the fair ground, 3 legendary event ranging from 5-15 but the most common level of legendary you receive is lvl 10

Nice! Just caught him smashing heads in Whitesprings. Before that i've bumped into him at the ash heap and Charleston.

Ah! Editing for clarity!

It's necessary for making certain sweetened tea recipes.

I have yet to see pepper used. Good to know it isnt just vendor trash.  
---
And I might have to start keeping salt for that reason....you are a genius.
---
Imagine how unlikely it would be to _ever_ get an X-01 jetpack if you _couldn't_ server-hop...
---
There's something very wrong with that picture.
---
This coming from the guy who is mad because Bethesda doesn't update the in-game announcement board as fast as they do twitter.
---
"Bethesda, please learn to announce your maintenance in a timely manner not 15 minutes before it happens"
---
Bethesda support tweeted 4 and 1/2 hours ago that servers were coming down. Pardon my terrible math skills, but 4+ hours is greater than 15 minutes, correct?
---
You made an invalid complaint, don't like that it was pointed out that you were wrong, but I'm entitled? 
---
When you say "before realizing it wasn't" I feel like you're ignoring all the food recipes that call for spice, salt, pepper, and sugar.

PornHub
---
It's a double edged sword, cause if they dont roll out some content then it will he the same players leaving....they are irritated with bugs but also bored with little to do once you kill a few queens and have a few good weapons.
---
Me personally,  I would like more camp options that dont look half blown up.  Wont my stove to not look broken dammit.  I enjoy camp building so for me there is still stuff to do over 100......setting up my storefront currently then waiting 6 months for that update lol.
---
Im on pc can u message me i need some made for mods im lvl 47 
---
While I'm not 100%, I can't see why it wouldn't. The only time that really becomes a factor is for games in different languages. Even then you can download it in other countries, it'll just be in that language. 
---
Well if they see you in a spot, they get curious, only way to avoid this is to block everyone on the server which is a pain. I wish they had a block all feature or a block me feature which I can be invisible on the map.
---
Really? A lunchbox click harvesting article? You can actually feel the authors shame.

The fucking data mined "lootbox" fiasco has made youtubers millions.
---
Guess you gotta have some place to cum dump during a circle jerk.
---
Yes, gameplay which is 100% reliant on the stability and availability of a 3rd party entity that runs and manages servers.
---
If the servers are offline, or the servers crash regularly, or the servers are brought down for hotfixes without adequate warning then I am being screwed over by Bethesda's inability to properly run the services which are a requirement for this game to operate.
---
Part of the cog which makes servers reliable is regular and consistent levels of communication.
---
Has Bethesda addressed the very frequent server crashes yet? No.
---
Has Bethesda addressed the server lag caused by nukes? No.
---
Has Bethesda addressed the loss of player resources caused by server crashes? No.
---
Has Bethesda addressed the complaints that have come up with every last minute hotfix so far? No.
---
I'm glad my input about this $60 product and the servers that are required for its use are of no value to you, however, I'm still more than happy to post on this subreddit regularly for other users who may not align with your "expectations" or "entitlement" for how the world should operate.
---
The Hunting rifle is the best weapon for any early level character.    
---
The super mutants at the WV Logging Camp to the NW of 76 is what I've used. I wait until after finishing the CAMP quest. Also, you can get the Small Water purifier for free and faster than normal but spending 25 caps to take a public workshop. At lower levels, don't worry about defending it but doing that unlocks a lot of CAMP recipes.    
---
Set your CAMP close to the super mutant place but far enough where they wont keep going after you and it. Clear the place out once. There is a PA station and 2 workbenches you can scrap all the loot. They ALL drop a few caps, .308 ammo, and hunting rifles.    
---
Keep the best rifle and scrap the rest. You should get enough XP for at least 3 levels. It won't take long before you've opened up every mod for it.    
---
Mods: Stabilized or True long barrel (distance), best receiver for damage, best stock for range/hip fire accuracy, Medium scope, Piercing/Stinging magazine (which is better), and a suppressor. You'll find you can take out a lot of them before they start fighting back.  
---
Even if your build is not rifle focused at all it still does good damage for a long range weapon.
---
The spice extends life. The spice expands consciousness. 
---
try wearing power armor, maybe they fixxed the wet look inside but as soon as your wearing power armor you have full animations of rain in your HUD like you would have outside  
---
xD
---
&gt;  this is NOT a hotfix! hot means the server is live 
---
 A **hotfix** or quick-**fix** engineering update (QFE update) is a single, cumulative package that includes information (often in the form of one or more files) that is used to address a problem in a software product (i.e., a software bug). Typically,**hotfixes** are made to address a specific customer situation.   
---
  *hotfix* is a software update designed to *fix* a bug or security hole in a program. Unlike typical version updates, *hotfixes* are urgently developed and released as soon as possible to limit the effects of the software issue.    
---
 *Definition* of *hotfix* \- a small piece of code developed to correct a major software bug or fault and released as quickly as possible.   
---
I haven't found anything that refers to a server being live other than Blizzard's definition
---
The game company [Blizzard Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard_Entertainment) has a different use of the term hotfix for their games, including [*World of Warcraft*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft) and [*Diablo III*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_III):
---
&gt;A hotfix is a change made to the game deemed critical enough that it cannot be held off until a regular content patch. Hotfixes require only a server-side change with no download and can be implemented with no downtime, or a short restart of the realms. 
---
Shooting &amp; Stacking a Railway Ammo onto a Railway Ammo will allow you to use it as a ledge.
---
The C.A.M.P. Budget should also be clearly delineated.  I've noticed it is, in addition to nearly EVERYTHING else in the game, extremely bugged.  You should be able to see how much each item will contribute toward your budget, not just broad percentages.  And it seems like it may be based on a weight of materials sliding scale, but I'm not sure about that.  I just know that brick walls seem to fill your budget up faster than wooden walls, and those heavy metal (lol, I needed a laugh...) turrets fill it up the fastest.
---
Also, very common in the nuke silos -- go in there solo, you'll be fine!
---
Like the SB example, i could see the "flesh" move on the SB when i shoot it... also had a ghoul on top of my bag inside a rhododendron bush at whitspring, same thing worked there :) 
---
Got my first 2 drop at level 13 it was awesome.
---
I think the completionist impulse blinds people to how Bethesda deals with choice.  Like, in Skyrim, if you had some kind of philosophical or moral objection to a quest, *you just don't do the quest*.  The consequence is missing out on the rewards of the quest, and maybe additional quests that would have followed from that one, but that's how you can express yourself.  No one is holding a gun to your head and forcing you to do all of them.  But a lot of players see the laundry list and diligently set about trying to clear it, and then complain that they were the masters of everything and never got to "take sides."
---
Radstorms are *really* rare for some reason, and rainstorms aren't common but they do happen. Seen them much more than radstorms, anyway.
---
Aw sorry to spoil it for you haha. 
---
Still doesn't fix the problem..  if i continue to play this character on the public servers that wouldn't address the issue at all.
---
I mean what is the problem with the silos
---
bugdethsa strikes again!
---
o.O ... how does that answer the question of why there aren't legendary hunting rifles?
---
Sad panda. I've seen it 4 times on three different characters. The last time I saw it I made sure to get a screenshot of him with my buddy. Took like 4 takes because Graham just keeps moving on to the next destination XD.
---
Most smaller bottles are glass. Usually up to 750mL. Most, if not all, manufacturers make 1.75L bottles out of plastic. 
---
You're thinking of a "hot swap" where there is accessibility on at least one server up at all times and updates are rolled out in a wave across the platform.
---
Does luck effect you chances on legendary drops or the number of stars on legendary drops?

If you’re on a team and have more than 3 charisma you can share your perk cards with your teammates by pressing triangle(ps4) with your cursor on the card. You can share one star of perk cards for every three charisma you have.

Tempted to make a competing restaurant Atreides now.
---
feels like you're okay with bad service, poor communication and shitty bugs that will never get fixed.
---
if you had some real love for this game, you'd push Bethesda until they improve. 
---
Thanks for pointing this out!
---
Oh god, I think if they tried to have a reactive economy the game would wind up trying to divide by zero at some point and destroy the universe. That's one thing I really don't think *anyone* wants them to break.
---
But yeah, the economy is flat and dead just like it is in a singleplayer Bethesda game and that's... not necessarily bad, but it does detract from things. If they can get things under control in other areas, I think they'd do well to consider at least some aspects of a living economy down the road when they've expanded enough on trading to make it viable, though. 
---
And yes, the issue with dupers and not addressing that quickly enough is really what inspired a lot of this. Not even taking the resultant server instability into account, if left unchecked much longer that could totally break the game. Imagine if the dupers started leaving TSE weapons in random containers so everyone over level 50 had one all of a sudden? Total chaos.
---
... and I almost want to see it just to see what would happen.
---
That only works on consoles.
---
Fissure Prime. But ask for help here first, and make sure you got some high level folks in your server.  
---
Nothing sweeter than smashing a queen on your first crawl-out through the fallout.
---
Man, we take down shit all the time, would we like to give a far amount of warning, yes. Do you think we want to take down the servers, no. Trust me, if they are taking them down, it’s for yours and Bethesda’s best interest. Whether you agree to it or not. (Well you signed the EULA, so you agreed to it.)
---
Yeah it will be fine, North America codes will work just fine. I am pretty sure they work globally. 
---
I would personally buy from Amazon so if your friend hates it you, might be able to return it and get a refund. I got a refund from Amazon. Also Canadian and I buy USA codes all the time and works just fine in Canada.
---
Also if you have started the Technical Data quest.  Pick up some in the enclave in the desks.  The safe to deposit is near 3 main vendors.  Harpers Ferry, Watoga BOS and Watoga Bot.  
---
Depositing will give you ~25 caps and some loot to sell.  Handy for covering fast travel to this area and also there are plenty of items inside the basement to pick up for selling.
---
Wait, did you do this quest with one other person? If so that may have been me :v

Hotfix does actually mean live:    
---
" The term "hotfix" originally referred to software patches that were applied to "hot" systems; that is, systems which are live, currently running, and in production status rather than development status "
---
I have used vats in all Fallout games before. 76 is the fist Fallout for me with a more or less useless vats. My build was initially made for heavy vats usage but with level 50 i have realized that i am hardly using vats because of the bugs so i had to respect.
---
And i also miss the perks Blitz and Critical Banker from Fallout 4. 
---
Thanks for your input, though I really want to know 100% before I purchase it
---
Each attack using VATS drains around 1% of fusion core capacity. Even targeting using VATS drains around 0.1%. I wrote a post with [some of my observations on fusion core drain](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7he9s/some_observations_on_fusion_core_drain/) a while back.
---
Workbenches are good for the occasional fight, i find most people don't bother unless it's the ammo factory.

Damn right about the weight glitch days, was always fun to kill someone and discover they'd been duping.

Fun tips for the Excavator power armor:
---
When looking at ventor stock for power armor mods, you can't always see what mod goes with what armor. However,  you can look at what the mod scraps into for a clue. In my experience so far, all mods for the Excavator armor scrap into Black Titanium. So far I've had good luck finding Excavator mods at Harpers Ferry, but I hear some people have found it at Watoga as well. Can't substantiate those claims so right now that's just a theory. A GAME THEO-
---
As someone in another post pointed out, if a friend gives you an Excavator suit, be very careful when completing the quest at the mining headquarters. The correct way to do the quest is to reach the headquarters, download the schematics, make the suit, and then return to register the suit. if you register the suit you were given BEFORE you try to download the schematics, you'll find yourself unable to get those plans, and as a result will have no way to learn the recipe for yourself, and will have to barter and trade with other players for level appropriate suit pieces.
---
While it says this in tool tips, some people still miss the fact that wearing the full Excavator suit provides not only a 100 pound boost to your carry weight, but it also gives you a boost when collecting from ore veins!  When collecting from the big crater-like deposits on the ground you'll still only get one at a time, but when pulling from the veins that form on rock faces, you'll get four ore per touch instead of one.  
---
My favorite places to make extra cash via Excavator mining are inside of the cave at Tanagra town, which spawns an abundance of gold and crystal, and above the unmarked train tunnel near Harpers Ferry. After you fast travel to Harpers Ferry, turn around and follow the train bridge to the tunnel, and take a right to follow the cliff face path. Keep following the path and the area around the path and you'll have more gold, silver, copper, and aluminum than you'll know what to do with. 
---
Oh right another pc player bitching about the game 
---
I havent seen any call for it yet....maybe I should reexamine my recipe list.
---
Some weapons only have mods you can install right? Or, you have to have the perk card like Science Master active to be able to learn those when you break it down. All speculation, but I'd love to know if this is correct.
---
i found one yesterday in harper's ferry. i immediately scrapped it bc i heard that Damage over time weapons were bugged. 
---
I havnt done this but I did hoard nuka quantums like a crazy person when fo4 was first out thinking I'd find a schematic for nuka grenades lol
---
X01 is not a possible drop, and neither is legendary gear.
---
Source, myself and hundreds of maps.
---
i guess to reduce serverload, radstorms are rare   
---
or because they are afraid of low lvls encountering them too often, so they made them rare
---
Oof. I've had 4 sets just duplicate themselves in my stash. 
---
I don't see why they can't just do an inventory check and if you have more then X of the same legendary then they all just vanish, same with plans if you have more then say 15 of any plan the void should eat the rest.
---
Alternatively just make it so that if your above say 800 carry weight that your character instantly dies and automatically drops excessive weight so you are within the 800 pound limit. 
---
"Hot fix"
---
Also, resources don't "repair" that tamed animal that took hours /days to find. And a player becoming Wanted is not good enough, a 10 cap bounty doesn't equal the time spent to find and tame.

I believe all the North American codes will work just fine.

Did he say we can have 16x the detail or we WILL have 16x the detail. Just because we can dose not mean we will.
---
I get what you are saying. Moving it to STR is a bad move though, STR already has way too many good perks. If anything heavy weapon accuracy and armor penetrarion could be in perception IMO
---
I'm not ok with any of that. The difference here is that I'm not on the edge of my seat looking for more things to cry about. 
---
Developers and make that choice, That would be on management. Developers don't tend to get to choose when something is released, they just have to work the unpaid overtime to fix it while the people who did choose to release it early get to enjoy their bonuses.
---
Already own an Xbox which is now capable. Don’t own a gaming pc, but appreciate your incredibly helpful response. Keep it up!

I liked to be original and pick places I hadn't seen nuked before, so I nuked that swamp way up north east.  But it turns out there's a reason people hit whitesprings all the time - they pay off there is just so much better.  There's lots of gardens and ghouls, many legendaries, and low(ish) level players can tag lots of enemies and level up several times from one nuke.   So while I don't like the predictable unoriginal path, Whitesprings is the spot.
---
I ran into him at Whitesprings the other day. Never expected to see him and Chally there.
---
To be honest with all the ways of buying weapons.. TSE weapons are already over used in the game.  
---
I was in the WSGC and I was rippin through with my chainsaw feeling a lot like Bruce Campbell then some runs in and BOOM. TSE shotgun. All dead.  
---
It was AF
---
LVL 103 checking in... never found an explosive, never found a two shot, have only found three 3-star weapons period. And I’ve killed the queen and launched maybe 15 nukes. I think that the first one I found was a junkies assassin night time weapon. Dropped it in Whitespring.
---
farm treasure maps and get PA armor &amp; mod plams from them ;)
---
Yeah, the economy doesn't have to be 100% rooted in what users do, but its really lacking in reactivity at the moment which makes it fairly dull.
---
Saw this happen once the dude was at my base me must have shot something but he stayed at my base for a while so i got worried and I went to check it out nothing happened the dude just left walking backwards while aiming his gun at me was super awkward lol
---
If you see a crafting table, junk your junk.  Even if you just junked your junk.  It saves a PHENOMENAL amount of space.
---
If you're miles from your camp and running out of space grab a workshop nearby.  They're easy enough to claim, you get some xp and you can teleport to your camp and back for free.  I do this sometimes just to get a close-ish teleport to reduce the cost of teleporting closer
---
How is duplicating ruining your experience? server lag? that isn't even proven I have a trader character with 300K+ of every resourses, 150k+ of stimpacks and radaways, and 500k worth of NukaCola , in addition to god knows how many weapons yet I trade on a full server perfectly fine. Want a solution? 
---
SEPARATE THE SERVERS PVP/PVE and have a list of servers to join.
---
Stop getting mad and trying to hurt people who are only doing what in my eye was EXPECTED when you release a game with bugs. 
---
Definitely.
---
Some of the advanced crafting recipes call for those.. but you have to gather like 5 to 8 ingredients. Like the Scorchbeast Stew.. liver brain heart ect ect ect. 
---
Officer? The scorched that beep? (Still new, still slowly exploring). 
---
Haha!  Gotta keep that X-01 paint fresh :D
---
For real and yep, I'm on PC. If we can get something positive out of a negative that's a win. PM me your in game name, I'll do the same. Will be on after the maint.
---
That's awesome I have so much tech data saved up
---
Are you on PS4?  That's eerie only bc that's the reason I gave him my old one.
---
Well that's dumb.
---
I don't maintain turrets anymore. I don't see the point in them. They use far too much budget, and if my base does get attacked, it's cheap enough to repair 
---
That WV Logging camp is good at higher levels too (15-25).  I've been exploring and WOW there are a lot of super mutants.
---
I'd say at low levels the pump action shotgun and hunting rifle make a good combo.  With the hardened receiver most things go down in 1-2 shots, particularly if you have the perks.
---
&gt; They will not add anything from new Vegas
---
40mm grenade launcher, the auto grenade launcher, the pump shotgun, maybe some more...
---
I have 5 missile turrets which are more than enough to protect the base if you construct it properly.
---
You need to put 1 foundation then stairs and put all your base upstairs. Then place the turrets so it faces the entry stairs.
---
Block the entry stairs with walls.
---
When monsters try to attack your base they'll try to hit the walls that lead to the stairs, and the missile turrets will destroy them.
---
Summerville lake, against a bunch load of super mutants. I ended up getting a 2 shot shit gun level 15.  It is what made me to go shot gun mode. I used it for a good 60-70 levels. It might of been an event I dont know. Back during the beta. My excitement was sheer joy. Totally changed my edperience. 
---
Rasberry.......
---
Lonestar!!
---
Hotfix for nuke issue, no known end time. 1-3 more hours if we go by previous hotfixes
---
4 missiles because the local wildlife is super angry.  It's worked for a couple of weeks and all I lost is one wall.  Though doing some peaceful crafting and having something blown to bits 15 feet away is a hell of a wake up call.
---
Cool photos
---
Yes, but not every mod is available from scrapping. For instance hardened receiver can't be learned from scrapping 
---
“That one”
---
You mean the perk that makes Heavy weapons at least not completely trash. 🤷‍♂️
---
You're right. Maybe they just wanted to store the 2889 gears, 500 stimpaks, 600 ballistic fiber, 2000 scraps of wood, etc in that lunchbox for fun. And even if that was the case, leave it in a world container and it's fair game. 
---
What if they added a recipe to "cook" purified water, 1x water + 1x wood = 2x boiled water
---
It done did Gary. It done.
---
What does that mean
---
i've been farming the miners in Welsh and that's worked pretty well. I know there's a method of using workshops to get the materials much faster, just wasn't sure if anyone here had more insight on that method
---
Theres not that many mods for tesla. And i believe all the plans and mods can be bought at both watoga vendors. Also have seen them at harpers ferry. 
---
Hotfix for the nuke silo issue, no set time on being down 
---
**Question:**  What is the benefit of short/stub barrels?  I had one on a 10mm submachine gun and it's range was so low it was useless.
---
Yeah I think you misunderstood me. I’m saying it’s broken.  I’m not confusing “tries reset” with “dud removed,” I’m saying “dud removed” is broken and despite the verbal confirmation, it does not in fact  remove a dud. 
---
I’ve only got had a “tries reset” once or twice and it worked as expected. 
---
Interesting! Where do I farm for these?! 
---
Got an explosive, +10% damage while mutated, +1 perception Tesla rifle.
---
Bought the Tesla rifle plan and got busy crafting / scrapping for mods.  40 odd scraps later I have discovered charging,  charging shotgun,  reflex sights and long scope.
---
Explosive energy weapon (that doesn't fall apart after 2 shots) is awesome.   Caution, this weapon has been linked to mass suicide of users.
---
but you can always nuke whitespring afterwards, while the mission has an optional goal to nuke prime which is only once.      
---
I always try to get optional goals, too  
---
I think you get more exp for doing prime while I am become Death
---
They have always worked for me
---
I like that idea.
---
Sounds like a great movie forming
---
Nowhere in my post was I talking about armor or underarmors. Referring purely to outfits. The ones that weigh 0.1 and go on over your armor and are all purely cosmetic *except* the tattered dress.
---
I don't bother with any turrets so that I can have an awesome 2 story cliff side house with multiple water purifiers, a junk collector, and everything else I could possibly need.
---
My camp is in the Mire north of Harper's Ferry, and the worst enemies I've seen have been level glowing Radtoads and the occasional level 40ish Super Mutants, neither of which can accomplish much more than destroying some plants before I kill them.
---
If you're new to the game, I recommend taking it slow and reading every note and terminal entry.  Also listening to every holo tape.  Take it nice and slow and get into that story. 
---
Top of the World is a suprisingly good source of lead and steel. There's like 9 can chimes you can disarm around that area that can net you a shit ton of steel and lead.

['merica](https://youtu.be/U1mlCPMYtPk)
---
They're fixing the nuke silos at the moment so there's a place to use all the duplicated launch cards. :/  
---
Yes, generally, a "hotfix" is a very small and short update, downtime sometimes but usually only like a restart at most.
---
We're going on an hour now...
---
Granted, they said servers were going down at 230 and they didn't come down til 242, so I think everything at Bethesda is just a little bit shit bow a days.
---
Really that is interesting, do you have any links to posts that discuss that?
---
The store is such a mess. I feel like you have to go through every category to be sure that you didn't miss anything. They really need a new section. That weird big menu thing that seems like it's supposed to be for new items is bad and doen't always show all the new stuff. 
---
If your test environment is production, that means the company you work for doesn't care about quality enough To pay for a test environment.
---
There is another below (inside?) tangara town.

Accidentally deleted when I went to edit, but that works.  You deleted the character so technically you helped Bethesda do their job.
---
I think that just affects the rate you regain health after the stimpak has been used, not the actual process of using it, unfortunately.
---
The ones I usually hit are
---
1. Flatwoods
---
2. Sutton station
---
3. Whitespring station
---
4. Whitespring bunker
---
5. Watoga station
---
6. Watoga shopping center
---
7. Harper's ferry 
---
I don't think this is a good idea sometimes griefers like to follow you and shoot you for no reason while your in pacifist mode had a guy follow me from fissure prime back to Watoga shooting me constantly 
---
He tried to sneak around me, but I snuck around him! The snooker has become the snorked!
---
I mean, not every place in the continental US would have had a surviving population 25 years post war. 
---
I've had this happen to me when getting the ammo workshop in I was lvl45 and he was lvl 130. I just finished the the scorched beast defend and used up all my ammo then boom a rocket launcher to the back. I came and got my junk and debated on what to do. I ran though 
---
Where do you get the recipes besides the Enclave? Or are you talking about only getting them from the Enclave science wing?
---
Seems like we got a captain obvious on our hands. 
---
It's bugged very badly.  Log out completely and log back in, repeat as necessary.  I moved my camp and all my items were doubled when I set back up.  But once I'd deconned the extras, it kept saying I was at max.  So I got mad and deconned a couple turrets, my water purifiers, all my veggies, and a couple superfluous lights.  Then I still couldn't place anything new down, so I logged out, logged back in, and my budget was at 62% used.  So yeah, it's bugged very badly sometimes.
---
Ooof. Yeah, I haven't actually encounted any TSE weapons that I've known of so far. I'm sure they've been used during queen fights, but I don't think I've seen anyone killing things in a way that seemed ridiculously overpowered yet. Best I ever had was a two-shot gauss (RIP) that I thought was a little OP as it was.
---
I would never play the trash fallout 1 2 or tactics 
---
Top comment of the day!
---
Thing is, the games bugs are massive and weren’t fixed at launch. And that’s the state in which the game has to be reviewed in. If Bethesda deemed it launch ready, then it was deemed as review ready too. And currently, no matter how much I enjoy the game, I’m much more tolerant of the bugs but the average person may very likely not be. The game still feels too delicate for me to be able to say the reviews are outdated or that the game can be said as better than what reviewers claim.
---
I didn't know there was a nuke, nice find.
---
Spite nukes are best nukes.
---
Ash Heap maps can give Excavator plans.  Cranberry Bog can give T-60 plans.  Nothing terribly interesting from the other areas that I've found from over 25 maps.
---
I use spotlight turrets to help those missile turrets out..... really helps out alot.
---
Level 150 here, and I have zero! Been through phases where I used to have 5-6 missile turrets on my small, bare, shi++y house. Now I’m all for decoration and no defence, if your base gets attacked, it barely costs anything to repair (especially with 2 in contractor perk), and your camp looks soooo much better! 
---
I'll give you a job when we open :)
---
Dude, you are arguing with a monkey who has probably duped. You're ideas are solid and reasonable; no reason you should have to try and justify them with the likes of someone who is stubborn, rude, and can't read
---
We back online on PS4 boiiis! 
---
Dog food is a better food XD, but until I made this post I was still unaware that the stuff was actually used in cooking. I carry the can-do perk so i am not big on cooking, so I did learn something new.
---
I lost a set of Ultracite armour because I got dc'd whilst trying to work out which one was which &amp; dropped the wrong one :(
---
Yep, I'm in too.
---
Isn't it passed your bedtime Trump ? go back to bed :D
---
I was on my second lvl 100+ character before I found my first explosive. Then found 2 that day. One was from a scorch queen. My group runs the queen generally 3+ times a day. My first character was 128 and still haven’t seen an explosive on him. My second character I’ve found 2 explosives, one of which is a 3* with 2 shot and i just hit 100 on him. 
---
Yes, yes it is. The fact that they relied on the console's baked in messaging system (and ignoring PC users) rather than creating their own in-game quick message system was a massive oversight.
---
Nuka Dark is in the game. You can get all Fallout 4 Nuka variants in the soda shop in the Whitespring off of the ballroom. 
---
I know you're just being saltsnarky, but I thought people might like to know.
---
I don't condone duping, but the servers had issue during the beta, after the beta, still have issues etc. People were speculating the duping caused the issues, but I hate to say it, bad programming and bad design are the real server problems. My game constantly freezes and crashes and has nothing to do with duping, that's just an old wives tale.
---
that's an easter egg for the Monster Factory Fallout 4 videos on youtube
---
I really like the feeling of danger in open world games because the presence of pvp. Plus I mainly play other fps games casual and competitive. However in 76 it's just not the same and badly done. I would do what you suggest in op situation. But because of how pvp rules and dmg reduction with lv difference works. Then there is also the prevelant TSE that removes any chance of meaningfull pvp. One shot mechanics with no mechanical skill or cost is never fun in pvp.
---
If those douches in op's story were a bit smarter/childish they could have annoyed him way more. But luckily they just set themselves up for slaughter. There are tons of post already about the pvp topic and I don't want to rant too much. Long story short, standing your ground isn't straightforward in 76 and scumbag strats are well known and annoying as hell.
---
The visual of someone just sprinting across the wasteland and every time they start to get winded they just pour a can full of coffee grinds down their throat really gets me.
---
The eagle has landed.
---
He was a good dude. Didnt even attempt to take the workshop. Just nuked me and left me with it. Worked out in my favor because the whole time I didnt have to defend it.
---
I did try to get others to come, but nobody on my friends list was active (this was pretty early in the morning). So yea, all I really did was add some frustration to their day, but I'd rather do that than just let them operate unfettered. I'm only one man. :D
---
Correction; 3 days.
---
Tin cans are my best friend. 1 Lead and 2 Steel per can.
---
Game is back online
---
Where can I find canned coffee?
---
Get a high vantage point and you can see storm clouds as they roll in. You can also see them hit different areas if the map.
---
Tell me of your home world usal
---
Whoops. I just sold my ultracite. I didn’t want mine
---
So far it seems like vram might be the issue.  
---
Which is kind of weird for only gaming at 1080p.  
---
This is the only game I've ever played that apparently uses an upward of 4gb on anything past medium settings o.o I'm not sure why either I play far crazier looking games on ultra with 60-100 frames stable.  
---
However this game seems to EAT vram currently.
---
Really wish turrets were cheaper.
---
Yeah, I'm baffled by the complaining on here. I mean, seriously, would you guys rather they *not* patch a major issue, just so you can play for a couple extra minutes???
---
What are they fixing? Never heard the silo bug.  Probably wont help with my crashes, server disconnects, etc etc etc...
---
I am level 9 and emptied a mag of 10mm into an invincible super mutant named graham yesterday
---
He was unharmed, tried to sell me overpriced stuff I am too low level for, walked into a wall before falling through the ground
---
Still bamboozled at what just happened, I was slowly eaten by a pack of feral dogs 
---
Lmaooooo yes you are likely very correct there
---
Well,personally i love when someone nukes prime, it's just so fun doing the queen, and the plans are great :)
---
If someone is on your team they recieve minimal caps 2-3 every 3 or so maps, some aid items, ammo, guns etc.
---
Yessir. Better than I expected too. The game is still filled with game breakers and shit but doesnt quell how great of a game it is.
---
Fix the Assaultron Head bug where it eats through all of your ammo in one blast.
---
If you have 10 Technical Data give a friend 9 of them to hold, when you turn in the quest it takes all of them on hand. If your friend hands you back one at a time, it will trigger the quest again. Rinse and repeat. Although, as mentioned above, they are in the bunker every trip I make.
---
I got one from a legendary robot at Watoga
---
At level 50 I believe 
---
No will not change that. But to fix that have them FT to you not your camp. This only fixes your own personal spawn spot. 
---
Really! I thought they were cosmetic, what do they do?
---
You could also just go third person to peek corners...
---
I'm still not quite clear on what going over 100% or 200% thresholds means for the stats on armor/weapons.  I know you can repair any armor or weapon up to 200%.  Armor DR/ER increases above 100%, weapons don't change.  So if you loot something at 230% but can only repair it to 200%... how does that affect things?
---
Define the ones like me.
---
&gt;I wish you could just go up to the person you “stole” from or got the bounty from and just pay them to caps to get rid of it.
---
I like how in RDR-2 you could just hi-tail it to the nearest post office and pay off your bounty.
---
You don’t drop armor to get out, you do the “use” button like E on PC.  Not sure what button that is on consoles.
---
I am perfectly fine with their model here. All cosmetics, no pay to win, and currency is earnable in game. If someone is weak willed, that is their problem, not mine.
---
watoga bots are a pain to kill if you're below level 50, any tips on killing them quickly? I've been guiding them into cars and then blowing up the cars. 
---
Fisto comes with the dungeon DLC
---
Never drop your power armor. Place it on the ground. Those are two separate commands.
---
Honestly it does nothing. I feel like its semi bragging that they got duped loot that they can feel good about. Bet a majority keep them after the self-righteous posts. 
---
It doesn't feel like an amazing moral high ground people are making it out to be.
---
do you know that you can "place" your PA you do not have to drop it.
---
For me it seems random. I wanted to target something on the ground next to me but instead it decided to target the SBQ miles away. 
---
I just lost 3000+ 5mm ammo this way.
---
This is a really frustrating bug.
---
It's just people doing the 3million dps shotgun exploit.
---
Yeah perhaps, only reason I said that is the servers have always been a mess and people love blaming glitching and duping on server issues which simply isn't true. But you right, I am sure every little counts. Same goes for server hopping, if masses are server hopping they could also be stressing servers, but then we back to bad game design ..
---
My game crashes more now than ever and much worse than even during the beta.
---
The one Melon in there cracked me up :)
---
&gt; TSE weapons
---
whats TSE ?
---
yeah ur missing something. you dont "drop" power armor. when you select it, it will give you an option to place the armor in front of you so you can enter it. if you're selecting the "drop" option, that is the same as discarding an item, which if it is painted it will destroy it.
---
Random question abou the 10mm SMG, but is there seriously no sight attachments for it? I googled it and nothing came up. 
---
Heavy weapons being trash is a weapons design problem, not a perk related problem. The best heavy weapon is the gatling gun, which is perfectly serviceable without stabilized because it's not horribly misdesigned. The other heavy weapons were seemingly designed in a vacuum realm where armor doesn't exist. Is that the fault of a perk, not at all, you could give a minigun or light machine gun 95% armor piercing and they would still be trash because they just suck as weapons. The only way to make those weapons good is to make them ignore armor entirely with the explosive legendary effect, which is completely broken on almost any weapon. 
---
Dunno for sure but I have read that it works. Good luck.
---
Did not think these were that rare. Got them off of the vendor last night and learned it.
---
desk fannsssss
---
The main problem is that no where did they say it was made of plastic.  The fact that many people assumed it was glass,  from either the shiny glossy look or the fact that 750ml bottles of alcohol in that price range almost always comes in glass, makes it almost a necessity for this clarification.  They didn't disclose this when taking peoples money.  
---
And if you believe the not disclosing was just a harmless accident you are very gullible.  It was intentional.
---
They didnt give up on ESO, took a while but it turned around,  fo76 will as well.  And as much as cash shops are irritating,  you can get lots of atoms in game, it's just cosmetic crap anyways.  The good part of the cash shop is money towards the game which means they are giving us content without charging for it as DLC, as per Bethesda, most dlc will be free if not all.
---
He said CLASSIC wrestlers, you'll just have to live with nightkin Randy Savage.  XD
---
We need a bag of chocolate covered coffee beans now.  Those are the shit when you’re trying to stay awake on midnight maintenance.
---
You can and should equip it from your inventory, dropping it makes it available for anyone to pick up
---
Damn, thats a pretty good idea!  I know a friend and I can easily solo the nuke silos, though we usually pair up for fun.  I'll give this a go next time we nuke.  
---
I didn’t know there was an exploit. Thank You.
---
I mean, player vending is pretty self explainitory.
---
The author is just playing dumb for the negativity.
---
So for me it is the withered or sometimes the diseased ghouls that make my game freeze then crash.
---
It doesn't seem to matter either way, for me. Whether they travel to me or my camp it sticks them in the same spot. :/
---
Yeah well were I want to build my base, radstags, murlurks and radscorpions will spawn nearby anyway.... so Kinda need the turrets.
---
The ones already making complaint posts and calling the game a dud who clearly don't enjoy it now, meaning they surely won't continue playing when content is released due to a bad taste in their mouth from release.
---
Is it rare and/or good for excavator? I barely ever use it. 
---
Have this painting on my fallout 4 castle build. I've decided to name my character or Nora Howard (yeah yeah I know. unimaginative. shut up) and I have the painting there as my headcannon is that that he was a long old ancestral of Nora's late husband, who also was a minutemen, I think the painting is hilarious
---
Right, but dead bodies are physics-enabled objects.  The loot bags and the rhododendron bushes are not.  explosives and explosive weapons DO move physics objects, but of there's no data for how the object would react to physical forces in-game, then they just don't.  
---
Like doors.  Doors are things that, according to the game, have two positions (open or closed) and an animation that plays when they are activated that "moves" the object between the two positions.  It's not moving in the physical sense, and bashing, gunshots, explosions, etc. don't have any effect on doors in-game, which is why I put "moves" in quotes up there.  
---
Wow I had no idea! Thanks for the reply 
---
Pistols are fun and require multiple shots due to the lack of armor pen skills the other builds get. It's certainly not for those who want to one shot everything. Minus fodder with head shots.
---
Best legendary effect by far is armor pen, which you got. Though had you waited till level 50 you'd have got a level 45 version, s'ok though .. just down to finding another legendary with it.
---
Get a 10 mil and pip 45 too. Both have easy to find ammo and are good in vats given you mod properly, anything that reduces ap usage ideally.
---
Luck perks help A LOT. Quick a few amazing crit building perks in it.
---
Make sure you're using WHITE KNIGHT and FIX IT GOOD perks maxed out.  That reduces armor repair cost to 1 ballistic fiber per piece, repairs it to 200% durability, and increases the damage protection (until it gets to 99% durability)!
---
Yeah that is very true. There's definitely some issues within the engine and game design for sure. I just feel like you said with the amount of people server hopping to find x-01 shocks and duping and shit it definitely adds the extra stress 
---
I've seen on here before that they'll rarely sell the recipes for like 11k or something. Was that a hoax?
---
What's it like to go through life so cynical?
---
Everytime he hits you with a super sledge "ooohhh yeaaah"
---
It was a hotfix patch for the nuke silos
---
If you’re on PS4 I’ll walk you through it sometime. Codes can be sourced from enclave computer if you wanna solve them
---
I'm gonna bet 1 kidney that more than half of these claims are people who don't read workshop warning. 
---
&gt; **but the dots representing remaining tries will not change** 
---
The dots representing remaining tries have never once changed for me when I remove a dud.  I've watched people on twitch play this game, and when they remove a dud, their remaining tries do not change either.
---
The only time "the dots representing remaining tries" change is when I get a "Tries Reset" notification.
---
Get marsupial jump. Jump. Vat and boom
---
Two shot explosive ... the #1 mass duped weapon.
---
How much if that food is typically dog food? Been thinking about taking good doggie and the can search perk.
---
If you get an Explosive (or better yet a Two-Shot Explosive) legendary revolver it's pretty good, but other than that you're gonna lag behind comparable rifle, melee or big guns builds.
---
Well dang, I got maybe 10 of those. I’m just nowhere near the end, or the middle for that matter. Probably why I didn’t know what they were lmao. 
---
Exactly. And thus the talk of their possible DLC with 1v1 elements is going to be a shit show. 
---
Yes please, so annoying having more than one power armor set. having to place them all to see the one you want to use.
---
The weapons and apparel are persistent but the plans and mods change for me.
---
Wires are known to do this when you scrap items without first scrapping the wire first. Known bug posted several days ago :/
---
I've had this same issue with my camp.  What worked for me was to just 'move' my camp about 4 inches.
---
True workshops are PVP areas.
---
I had the best luck with Excavator mods at the two Responder vendors in the southwest. Welch and... Lewisburg I think? Still looking for that damn second Calibrated Shock.
---
I use that tall metal cabinet in lieu of a door.  It's awesome.  And it doubles as a STASH, so if someone can't get in my house, they at least have access to their STASH.
---
If you fire once then hit reload, all five bullets are loaded instead of just one i.e. reloading takes much longer than it should. It makes the rifle awkward and irritating to use and a liability in certain situations e.g. when facing six enemies.
---
Haven't been able to get this to work, despite following the instructions to the letter. In fact the only mod I've managed to get working is the one that shows what junk will break down into when looking at it in the world.
---
Have you ever seen wood armor that wasn't legendary. 
---
 I make .44 at the Tinker's Bench. You can make enough quite easily. Farm lead as you go. 
---
 The level 45 Voice is not bad against Robots and my level 45 10mm gets a lot of use. 
---
I guess I should stop drinking my flux.
---
If got run around the north west of the map enemies shouldn't be too high. You can take over work shops discover places and kill mobs. Thats how i got through the hump. 
---
The main problem I face is that there seems to be a difference in spawning via fast travel and spawning via logging in. When I fast travel to my CAMP I get placed near the front, which is awesome and I'm fine with. When I spawn at my camp because I'm logging on, it tries to put me on the very edge of my CAMP, which happens to be hanging over a cliff.. and the server tends to load my CAMP after I load, which leads to me falling and dying unless I'm wearing power armor.
---
I've tried to move my spawn point using the method in this video, but it does nothing for the logging in spawn, just the fast travel one. 
---
Thank You God for making this happen while I was at work.
---
Read my post history. Do I fit your description?
---
Also INT factors into xp so higher INT = more bonus xp from killing mobs. A week or two after launch, someone figured out a now-fixed exploit to boost his INT as high as he wanted. This resulted in stupid amounts of xp and every kill (even from a lvl 1 molerat) gave more than a level's worth of xp such that with only a few hours of play, he was over lvl 900.
---
Someone's always gotta mess this shit up for me. Like, you get the mask, you put it on long enough to get the candy bucket in a good spot, and you take that shit off. Stand by the bucket and farm all the sweet sweet mobs/legendaries that spawn right to it. There's always that guy that shows up and starts trying to PVP. Like I know it's labeled PVP but I'm just here for plastic, exp and loot dammit. 
---
Lvl 105 here.  I use a revolver.  With sneak and crit bonus damage, I one shot enemies almost always.  Using the gun fu perk with head shots is a lot of fun too.
---
Yep explosive exploit exist
---
I use shotgun two shot tesla (non explosive for chaining) and love it
---
Were you not running Bandolier? Or is that how much, say, thousands would weigh with it on? Asking for... a friend.
---
And the only way to interrupt the landing animation is to instantly jump as you hit the ground, sending you into the air once again, then you have to cancel the landing again so you jump again etc etc and you end up leap frogging across the wasteland
---
I wouldn’t like to say, I’ve personally never, ever seen a recipe in the Enclave bunker for sale, I’d personally need to see it to believe it, as far as I know, killing the queen is the only way. The ones you see on here for sale from other players are just dupes they’ve received from the queen that they already have, hence why they can charge 11k + for them.
---
This is just a small list of tips I have gathered so far, of stuff I wish I knew.
---
 - You can build a lead extractor in your camp. Find a lead deposit, move your camp, go to the resources tab and bingo! Free lead for you each time you return home. (This requires that you have taken over at least 1 workshop once, to unlock the extractors.)
---
 - Morgantown highschool is a great source of plastic if someone haven't beaten you to it. The enemies there are also low level, and drops a lot of shotgun ammo.
---
 - This is probably well known, but Camp Mclintock is great for springs. There is a lot of clipboards lying on the ground.
---
 - Every new friend is a free fast travel point! don't be afraid to accept a friend invite from a stranger. They can be easily blocked again if they turn out to be a rare troll.
---
 - Wait until you are level 45, to build the exavator power armor. Starting from level 25, every 10th level, you can build a new level of excavator PA, ending at 45. Save your springs and black titanium by waiting until level 45, so you don't constantly have to build new parts.
---
 - DO NOT bulk acid! It will end up weighing 1.5 x as much.
---
 - Gold and silver scrap is very lightweight, and sells to all vendors without bulking. Good for getting all the caps at the vendor.
---
 - Many unmarked locations on the map will allow you to build your camp at a cabin, raider settlement, etc. You can even build your C.A.M.P at Murgle the cat's place!
---
 - The "Super Duper" perk card in Luck, is a really nice thing to have if you pair it with a maxed "ammo smith" perk card. It gives a 30% chance for anything you craft, to craft it twice for free.
---
 - You can build stuff in your teammate's camps, and vice versa! If you have a friend who knows how to build something you want in your camp, he can build it in your camp, as long as you are on the same team. Great if either of you know how to place down advanced turrets etc, and the other one doesn't.
---
 - A lot of the time, I fast travel to low level players and drop off unwanted plans, that I can't use anyways. If a high level player is near you, and is standing still, check for a brown paper bag at his feet! He might be dropping you some goodies. I know of at least 2 other players besides me that does this.
---
 - Getting sick all the time? Get the Luck perk card called "pharma farma". Fully upgraded, it gives you a 60% chance of being able to find extra chems in chem containers. I constantly have a surplus of antibiotics and disease cures because of that card. Remember, you have to press "space" to search if you are on PC.
---
 - The perk card called "batteries included" under intelligence, fully upgraded, takes 90% of the fusion cores weight off. Definitely worth it in my opinion.
---
 - If you keep needing lead like me for ammo, look out for the "breach and clear" events. Those will provide you with a lot of lead, iron and aluminum. 
---
I'm a 15 Strength melee guy, so their real # is probably a lot closer to yours. 
---
" When I tried to drop it it gave me the prompt that it would be deleted. Surely that would mean it would just delete the paint job. "
---
what?
---
I have a prime tse I found the weight of the ammo mitigated the cost. I only carried like 100 or so rounds
---
This.  I'm amazed no one has stolen your PA by now.
---
Yeah I saved my flux for weeks, moved them all on a mule 
---
I just logged in. They patched a bunch of bugs. Not defending them but let’s see how this goes. 
---
There is a junk workshop, central location. South East of vault 76.
---
Warframe 
---
Considering I use a Gatling Gun with 15% chance to stagger I could definitely see this being a possibility.
---
That was my stash weight, yeah I run Bandoiler max rank
---
You hold down the firing key while it cycles to full power,  then let go to zap target.  Lightning bolt will then arc to any nearby enemies and zap them too, and arc again to another target.  I've gotten 3 or 4 targets at a time.
---
I prefer the shotty barrel because my Tesla rifle has an explosive effect, and just does more damage.  However,  watching a lightning bolt arc and dance,and detonate  threw a pack of ghouls is one of my fondest memories of Fallout 76.
---
Sheer luck. I was limping my way back from a SQ fight (I was overencumbered), and ran into a mob of stingwings. One of them was legendary, and dropped a TSE + weightless gatling gun. It's made all subsequent Scorchbeast fights so much easier...
---
Just going by this post, pretty much everyone who turns into that at one point supported the game (and I'm not going to read the post history of every person I converse with on reddit, I'm busy playing the game)
---
radstags, murlurks and radscorpions, are more the norm.
---
Plus the small chance of mothman.
---
I was easily able to take one down when I had 5 turrets, not so sure about 4.
---
&gt; no refunds?
---
People have gotten refunds for FO76.
---
@OP 
---
others are correct, you dont drop your PA with xbox button (x) but instead place it in front of you with xbox button (a)  
---
It also tells you so while in pipboy
---
mine is a bloodied DCG, you can have it. i've switched to something else.
---
Don't make my mistake. Drop all but one. I think I had 55-60 that got consumed on the first completion. :'(
---
Trust me I know. I was hunting for 3 star combat in heavy variant. It gets really hard on the last couple pieces 
---
Wow. How did I read that as “chairs” ...
---
My t45 is level 25
---
Right, I think they claimed it didn't but it actually does increase exp gain. But after like 75 that doesn't even matter (you should have all the perks you need and scaling really only seems to go up to 50). I'm like level 120 and I keep like 5 or so unspent levels just because I don't really need anything else (most of the levels I spent up to that point were carry weight or crafting perks that are situational).
---
Yeah, I'm not saying those games were not successful. Having a cult following of fane still to this day shows that .
---
I'm just saying that if Bethesda hadn't bought the IP when interplay folded, the franchise would not exist today.
---
You have to manually select it from the Luck perks.
---
You won’t feel guilty soon enough. I have about 20 of those things before I realize weight was more intense a restriction. But that one you found wasn’t me. I always leave them with no FC. Im just mild trolling lol. 
---
&gt;Change the cost of repair for armor. It's cheaper to craft from scratch.
---
I never understood this complaint. This is What the white knight and Power patcher perks are for.
---
 If you don't want to have them equipped at all time it's fine but you should at least have them on when repairing. 
---
They makes the repair costs laughable. And below 50 you are constantly replacing with better/higher level pieces so holding onto one is not efficient anyway .
---
For weapons i agree as there is no similar perk (or at least i don't remember if there is) but for armor, you do.
---
Dude, chill.
---
Because it makes the vendors un-nukable so that's where I would set it up if if I were going to set up a major vendor hub.
---
I mean people can put them wherever they want but OP shows that there will clearly be people looking to grief any trade hubs with nukes so the easy solution is to set up where they can't be nuked.
---
I have a set of T-45 you can havr, on PC.
---
Or-
---
Sometimes grab everything. Sometimes grab nothing. 
---
Im sorry this has happened to you as well and at some a grave level! I hope there can be some fix for us both. thank you for taking the time to post
---
at least you got brick walls piggy
---
I don't have it 
---
Oh got you. I've totally given up on storing ammo or chems in my stash at this point. Hoarder problems.
---
does this work the other way around? like can you un-bulk junk to loose-state?  
---
and if so, do you net 5 extra acid in progress? (exploit)
---
I bought the nuka cola rocket girl costume + red / white pip boy skin
---
Ah, so what you're saying is that it will be a specific zone? Why not at top of the world on the 2nd floor. And if that was the case, then do you rent out a vendor or do you purchase one everytime you log on a server. Speculation runs rampant in my mind.
---
Appreciate it buddy! Will definitely check it out tonight! Is it inside the building?? 
---
They really do sell them in the enclave genetics lab. I usually trade and go straight to the aid section but when I opened the trade window I seen a recipe for egg head selling for a whopping 19k caps!
---
Do you have to drop them? Can't you just place both of them and have one automatically recalled?
---
Yeah for sure along with dodger in agility which is all damage.  I guess it was more of a point i was trying to make.  Damage enough to kill someone quickly isn't really a problem so much as how to avoid dying instantly.
---
Rather have real content then overpriced bullshit.
---
I did a whole play through with those. Blitz would be nice in 76 if it didn’t bug out

If you have the green thumb perk, you can get 200+ Razorgrain from the field next to billings homestead. If you also have the excavator armor, you can server hop and harvest the field multiple times (I usually get 400+ before overencumberance) and just sell it to vendors. You can also harvest 100+ corn from silva homestead next door, but it weighs twice as much as razorgrain.

Fallout 4 Home Base - 8 Missile turrets, 4 Laser Turrets and a dozen Heavy Auto Machine Gun Turrets (Plus more)
---
Fallout 76 Home Base - Struggling to maintain 3 Missile Turrets and one Heavy Laser Turret. (and have everything I need at my base.)
---
Um no, stabilized grants 45% armor pen which is mandatory regardless of whatever heavy weapon you choose. In fact, it is probably more so than other weapons since Heavy weapons tend to rely on rapid shots of low-medium damage rather than slow single shots of high damage like the semi automatics.
---
But that’s not the point I’m trying to make. My points are that:
---
1) Heavy weapons balance shouldn’t rely so heavily on Power armor. Furthermore, PAs are going to inevitably be nerfed sooo that could open up another can of worms for Heavy weapons users since we have no choice but to use it. Lastly, that chained together balance is going to create a headache for Bethesda, I can already see it. 
---
2) Not everyone even likes the aesthetics of PA. I certainly don’t but at the same time, there is a significant difference in damage when using the perk vs not using the perk but that’s something that all weapon archetypes with armor pen. So, if you don’t want to blow through all your ammo on one enemy, Armor pen is absolutely mandatory. 
---
Give them some time.... do you even remember how long it was from the launch date of Fallout 4 until we got the Contraptions work shop add-on? it was like 4 months. Except this time they have to fix a broken game.
---
Because its one of the most requested QoL improvements and its in the master list (section 7, Naming and Organization
---
)
---
This WOULD be one of those self-aware jokes that we USE to think were cool from Bethesda like "I read on the internet that our games have a lot of bugs" or "it just works" but I think all that good will has been used up and now it'd be looked on cynically as pandering.
---
+F
---
Need 4 more and one of them is leave vault 76. Nice one Todd 
---
I get that.
---
But the point of the cash shop is for developers to make money, is it not?
---
If the prices are based around the fact that we gain atoms in game, and people are only purchasing things with atoms they get in game because the direct cash-to-atom ratio is so bad... What is the point of it even being a cash shop?
---
So while I very much appreciate that we earn free atoms in game, I think cash shop prices still need to be looked at at a direct dollar-to-item ratio, as that's the goal from Bethesda's side.
---
This cash shop design is... Not good, for anybody, really.
---
Why could you not be killed when passive mode is on? It literally just prevents you from damaging non engaged players.
---
Kill rights are team wide and always have been. If a team wants your workshop and you are solo, they either have a new workshop or you are a badass.
---
Reminding me of NPCs in Oblivion.
---
I like the character development, going from a pipe wielding maniac to an explosives nut who punches faces in was fun, currently at level 40.  
---
I've enjoyed the exploration bits, done a few U turns in high level areas etc.  
---
I walked the tracks  in each area to find the stations so I would have a stash dump spot handy anywhere I was.  
---
As far as all your stuff "sucking", its because you (a recently released vault dweller) SUCK at navigating the outside environment.  You're supposed to suck, your food should suck, the water should be poison and weapons should be taped together junk.  Which sounds like where you are.  
---
The mystery you're looking for is in the quests, which instead of watching a play, you have to listen to the audio book.   Want more?  Read more on the terminals.  
---
Your camp is your one free travel pass on the map, put it in a central spot to reduce travel costs elsewhere.  (Hop to camp, then hop to location)
---
Your camp is also a resource generator, pick your poison and start crafting.
---
Interacting with others is what you make of it.  I send random invites to same levels on my server.   I had a guy try and bash me the other day, killed him, but gave him his stuff back.  We're buddies now.
---
Well dang. Maybe I can give them to some higher level dudes or something? 
---
I've never seen anything stronger than a handful of ghouls attack my camp when it was in the Forest, but outside the Forest it seems like it's entirely random. I live in the Savage Divide now, on a cliff outside Whitesprings and I *mostly* just get molerats and mongrels, but there have been multiple times where I've been attacked by up to 3 scorchbeasts simultaneously along with their scorched infantry.
---
I use a board with blades, and lots of strength... Me BASH with STICK!     
---
My armor mostly sucks, 
---
&gt; Just because you cant nuke camps
---
???
---
I have both and wear the ultracite... Because IMO it looks way better.
---
Right now the things I'd most like to see are the ability to scrap ammunition and bulking ammo into ammo boxes..
---
Buffs to unarmed, it's been an afterthought since Fallout 4.  It needs more variety, better weapon mods, stats, and perk abilities, and it should be able to be used in power armor.  It's silly that you can't, and that makes it pretty much an inferior option compared to melee.
---
Buffs to energy weapons, because a lot are really lackluster at the moment, plasma in particular is in a depressing state, especially since it has to deal with travel time on top of lag.
---
Passive benefits to SPECIAL points over 5.  Mostly because there is a slight lack of diversity when you realize you can swap out a lot of skills and only use them when you need to.  If SPECIAL stats gave passive benefits over 5, then it would add some new diversity to players who invest a little more into specific stats.  Perhaps being able to equip certain perk cards for free without point investment, or doubled effects.
---
And on a more personal level, I want to see the gore in the game extended a bit.  Head explosions for scorched for example instead of just clean decaps.  And please, for whatever reason melee weapons don't dismember enemies on death, except if you sometimes hit something after they're dead.  These weapons should be tagged to gore enemies on kills, just as guns do, but they seem to be incapable of doing so.
---
I used to farm whitespring/the bunker for canned dog food. But carnivore+butchers bounty makes farming scorchbeast steak more weight efficient
---
I don't think I follow, then. I was saying Bethesda didn't replicate earlier successes, but they did make a ton of money off what they did make. I guess I don't understand what point you were trying to make by responding to my initial comment.
---
That and the request to remove "Bubbles in my beer" made me mad. 
---
I’m interested in this kind of build as well.  Note that all the heavy weapon perks don’t apply to explosive though?  Is that intended in your build?
---
Did you exploit to 91 and have like 70 unused perk points? That's about the only thing I could think of
---
Dammit, he brought up the houses AGAIN?!?! I like the dude a lot, but boarded up houses have been in every 3d fallout game.  May just have to skip that part when my podcasts get there....
---
you obviously not farming white springs
---
I was shooting them on the ground with the Gatling while I walked up to switch to my axe... Maybe staggering them on the ground has a chance to reset them to taking off again?
---
I mostly use super sledges myself 
---
Me too...😥 
---
It is a song, on the song list, in the game. How do you not know that?
---
My base is near Rosa. It's across the street of the train station and there's static super mutants spawn/roadblock. They have the greatest desire to destroy my stuff. I've literally watched they spawn out of the ether to destroy my stuff :/. The turrets definitely help keeping the monsters at bay. I don't mind the resource restraint they make since its needed. 
---
lol, what fucking peer pressure do you expect you will gather in a "legit" community?
---
People don't care enough about duping, those who care can do nothing since there is no private server or way to punish people, Bethesda doesn't give a shit and is a incompetent game company and they aren't even able to fix a problem that MMO's solved 20 years ago.
---
I just stumbled onto this yesterday. You can also make glitched floating bases by deleting everything but the stairs afterwards. Not really any point since its very difficult to get back up to it. 
---
So, looking at a few comments it would make since for the player to set up shop in the Untouchable zone, but, players with Wrecking ball should still be able to attack their luxurious camps and have a bounty right?
---
I thought perhaps when you load back in, the game recognizes there is a structure there, it just fails to identify it as belonging to you.  I changed servers 7 times, logged out completely, logged back in twice, and got the exact same message.  There is no possible way that 9 someones in a row occupied my little tiny claim of irradiated West Virginia soil.  
---
And I’m sure he was using and Exploit and glitch that breaks the PVP formula.
---
It wasn’t because he was using a TSE. It was because he was cheating.
---
I was saying it was hard to believe with all the testing we did with out video evidence. Remember evidence is need for Science and proof. This isn’t a personal attack.
---
Nope 
---
so what you're saying is:
---
"they know about it, there is no fix, dont bother"
---
is that what you mean?
---
Isn't that being "selective" ;)
---
There are two FalloutCustom.ini locations. One is in the install directory. The other is in C:\Users\Name\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76. Make sure you edit both
---
Aaah. I'm down in the south 
---
Unless it glitches out, which is often.
---
My husband has the card, but half the time it only removes rads from me, not him. He frequently has to remove and re-equip the card to get it working again.
---
Ugh i had 4 gun turrets.. then went up to 4 heavy gun.  Then I caved and dropped down to 3.  Then i wanted to upgrade to missile now i'm down to 2... It's depressing.
---
Not based on stars, it's based on point. Some perk cards have two points for one star, so need 6 to share 
---
I could help you run tests.
---
Ive tried that. they even went down and back up for maintenance and still getting the same error.
---
I have a Tesla coils mod but it doesn’t say what power armor it’s for
---
I've stashed a few 100% cores and only carry a few partially charged ones on me. If i run out of partial ones, I grab one full one then start hitting up locations of known fusion generators and pa suits to try to replenish my supply.
---
That sounds delightful for Empath, it’s starting to grate on me when solo or with people who don’t also have it to negate my negative part.  Also it doesn’t show class freak reducing the negative, which I’ve read is only a display issue but based on gameplay I have my doubts it’s only visual.
---
Oh yeah, I've got plenty of those, too.  A floating tree I found near Phillipi Graveyard, a tire swing not hanging from a tree near one of the junkyards, a skeleton half-stuck in a portable bathroom door.  Especially fun when you use one of the "Welcome to West Virginia!" frames.
---
Scorchbeast are pretty much a sign to move camp.
---
Right now I am in The Toxic Wastes, getting a nice source of resources.
---
Im sick of the theme around here from pve players. "Defending a low levels workbench from high level jerks" or "i was at a workbench and a jerk took it"
---
No. People were playing pvp in the pvp zones. If i take your bench, i want to have a few rounds of pvp.  I dont want you to cry on a forum.
---
It does, but can only get mine to spawn me further away..meh
---
I invite people before logging off if I have any workshops. 
---
So you get a large blade weapon and she is only allocated a windshield washing tool?
---
First time it didn't work.  Second time I got a queen.   SECOND time I swear the game went FUCK YOU.  82 stim packs later I'm still dead and pissed.  Today I'm trying it again 
---
Thank you very much. I'll just keep trying moving the camp after every patch in hopes theres a fix someday.
---
Again thank you for taking the time. its at least made me feel better knowing that its not just me and that theres no known fix.
---
I'll just sit and wait.
---
lol
---
Awesome me too I'll hit you later when I'm getting on for sure!!
---
i have my camp box inside my camp, but when fast travelling i have 2 spots where i spawn, both outside though  
---
The first is right next to my camp which I spawn at mostly (80% of the time)   
---
The other one is behind my camp, (takes the other 20%)
---
In that case, I understand and appreciate the delete.
---
Titles for Power Armour ? Earnt by completing feats, Applicable from the Power Armour station.
---
You've killed 76 Scorchbeasts you earn the " Juggernaut " to name your Power Armour with.
---
Also locks item from scrap/trade lists... And can be applied to naming Weapons.
---
I'm sure it would have to be some kind of zone or structure, could be in a few places. Not quite sure how the vending and stuff may work, especially if there was something like a rent cost on login, followed by a disconnect
---
(It may just be something like free to post but the game skims 10% of the caps)
---
I had thought about it and haven't done so because I figured nothing would get done, but woulnd't hurt to try I suppose.
---
Camden Park is another good spot. Rumor has it there's a very, very small chance to get the plan for cali shocks there
---
Worst comes to to worst, if you use PC, good ol' Print Screen still works as it did in Fallout 4 and will auto-save pictures for you... the trick is just finding which folder.
---
Yeah, I went back there after lvl 50 to see if high lvl mobs would spawn but they still stayed between the 15-30s. It makes me think that the north western area has a lvl cap for mobs unlike the eastern part of the map. 
---
I've been killed twice in pacifist mode both times I was in a nuke zone in power armor.  
---
The first time it was actually two hits that killed me, someone hit me with a melee weapon and I didn't think anything of it because I was in pacifist mode and figured they were only going to do slap damage.  So I continued to loot the corps I was looking at and next thing i know i get hit again and I fall over dead.  I watched as he looted all my hardened masses.  He was running around Whitesprings with a several hundred cap bounty shortly after that, I'm sure from doing the same thing to other players.  
---
The second time someone nuked Watoga and a friend and I were just walking around the city.  My friend was around the corner of a building hiding from robots since he was low level and I was standing in the open.  Next thing I hear several explosive shots and I fall over dead before I have time to react.  It seemed like it may have been an explosive minigun but I don'y know, all I know is it instantly killed me.  
---
There definitely is (or was) an issue with people being able to kill people in pacifist mode extremely quickly (essentially a one shot) I wish i could tell you what causes it, I wish I had proof.  I haven't had it happen to me in a while but if it does again I will try to capture it with Instant Replay from Shadowplay.
---
 Ive moved my camp twice. once after each update in hopes of this  working...I can try again when the servers come back up I guess. Thank  you for taking the time to suggest a help for this. I appreciate it and  if you ever run across a fix please let me know. Thank you again for  your time and help 
---
The charging one is buggy too from what I understand, can cause you to crash.  I had a buddy have that issue with that barrel but seemed like it only crashed him when he shot bug mobs oddly like the mosquitos.
---
Shotgun charging isn’t bugged from why I’ve read on here
---
Do you craft ammo at the tinker's workbench?
---
I do that for all my 10mm ammo, though I'm just level 23 or so. I should be using my .44's more.
---
My planned build was pistol+melee, but in practice it's been mostly melee.
---
My experience is it doesn't matter. The instant I get to the clubhouse ghouls start aggroing on the camp. 
---
I did that event once, and no. No it was not worth it. Not at all. The rewards were trash, even without being compared to how much I used finishing it.
---
You can "posse up" with friends, but you are still in the same world with other people as well.
---
No friendly free roam like rdr1 online had. No solo servers. No coop.
---
Just put it in the nuke free zone 
---
Even better :
---
Let me display them at c.a.m.p! 
---
I've never had passive mode on. I'm telling that person they can be killed and griefed with passive mode on in FO76. There are a a bunch of pvp exploits in FO76. The whole PvP system is a mess. And I sit in workshops with all of my defenses and nobody even comes for pvp. Then they have this great system with blocking to make people invisible on the map. I could go on and on about all of the ways it's poorly done. In RDR Online if you mess with someone you don't get to disappear from the map, you have to deal with it until you leave the server. And I will hunt down anyone for my entire session if they mess with me, so I prefer RDR much better.
---
Pay2win?
---
I never paid, but i win often.
---
I'm fond of Mr. Fluffy and his passive aggressiveness.
---
I haven't even been to white springs, but maybe some day!
---
(I'm only level 10ish)
---
I just think it'd be hilarious to have such a terrible DJ though ( a fun terrible DJ mind you, not an annoying terrible one like Travis). and since there wouldn't really be any changing dialogue like in previous games he wouldn't really need to talk all that often, so just a little chatter every 3-4 songs to break it up. 
---
Maybe not better but still needed
---
I am lvl 153, and challenge wise the game still thinks I do not have a single maxed perk and I learned about 10 craft recipes...
---
It's a great place for resources and water.
---
I believe there is a minimum amount of points needing actually invested in luck before it becomes available. How many points have u in luck?
---
Sweet, thanks for the help. if you ever want to team up let me know
---
This is an incredible list. The menu fatigue is super real. Bravo on coming up with all these great points involving the ui/ux.
---
You can definitely snap walls to the sides.  The stairs just always have to go in first.
---
Now i want to go and work on my home and make it look awesome. Yours looks amazing!
---
Yea man.
---
Relog
---
Shit. Why hasn't someone asked for this before now? /s
---
I have run into a couple over at Robco a number of times.
---
It looks better with the wetsuit.
---
Yep.. that's what I was confused about.  My camp has been nuked before.
---
I'm a level 150 and I've only ever seen him twice. Once during the BETA and the other was about 2 weeks ago
---
well they are being stingy with them, of course 90% of the time what I see attacking me is not what is anyone's inventory when I loot them. or is that 100%...
---
Ah, sorry. Consider me corrected. I have never seen them there. Still 19k is crazzzy!
---
It's great. The only thing I'm worried about is Grenadier... I use a TSE and have issues killing myself already while nuke farming WSP. If your doing this just for queen you'll be fine. 
---
Great build by the way. Solid and has a great DPS booster. I can't really even think what I can could give you advice on. 
---
I'm intrigued to know if the Heavy weapon perks along with exp perks will stack for TSE's. 
---
&gt;  issues but at least I can do whatever the hell I want without having to worry about some jagoffs with a varmit rifle insta-headshotting
---
You mean you dont have to worry about speed hackers? I mean worry about people stealing your items through trade glitches? Sorry, I meant you dont have to worry about your CAMP items disappearing but still taking up space? What I meant was, you dont have to worry about constant disconnects? My apologies, I mean you dont have to worry about bullets not doing damage?
---
Silos are fixed.
---
Oh yeah, you're right, your stash has unlimited space...right...😐
---
I pretty much only store junk and things not affected by weight reducing perks/legendary armor in stash (bobbleheads, orbital strike grenades, etc)
---
Welcome to any other day on Fallout
---
Take workshops at your own risk. Server disconnects are the real enemy
---
Yes. I knew that. My explosive gatling counts as a regular heavy but gains damage from the explosives perk. Also my Missile Launcher and Fat Man gains reduced weight because of my heavy perks. (I figured I was already half way there so why not commit) I added the ordnance weight perk so I could rock gernades and make my 150 missiles and 30 nukes only weigh 20 lbs &gt;.&lt; 
---
Note: Its not a deal breaker but its practical at this moment... besides, how many people do you see launching Fat Men and Missiles at things.
---
&gt; besides just randomly walking around? 
---
You just answered your own question. That's mostly it.
---
Other than events that glow markers on the map, you just pick an area and see if it gives you a quest.
---
Also, not sure whether or not you do this, but it's worth reading all notes and terminal entries too. Firstly it's a thing to do but also it can trigger quests or give clues to potential quests/explorable areas nearby e.g. Mama Dolce (not going to say more on that matter to avoid spoilers).
---
carnivore, my ign is Daliko what is yours?
---
I built my camp at a lead mine so I tossed an extractor on top of it. Can't say I really want for ammo, but my friends that I play with take a cut of the lead too for their weapons. 
---
There is a treehouse guarded by one. Not at home at the moment, but I know it's on the east side of the map. It's definitely not the Treehouse Village, though. Hope that helps. Fucker killed me multiple times! 
---
Don't try this in real life 
---
Yeah, someone datamined the mod learn rate and found those just aren't linked up.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a5pbsr/every_weapon_mods_learn_chance/ebocxsi/
---
"PA does have it's own learn chance values. Problem is, they are not referenced by a single thing. Unless PA scrapping works differently from weapon and armor scrapping, it seems like it's not possible to learn PA mods through scrapping."
---
My 30 minute ques disagree 
---
Can you get in using the Nuke Shelters nearby?
---
There's 3 in a row, you just step in and shut the door.
---
The main quest will eventually lead you to the brotherhood and enclave, and you don't get to do their events until you do.  I'm not sure if you can sequence break and do them out of order, but yeah most of the side quests are just found through exploration.  After you finish all of that though you're pretty much left with events and challenges.
---
did you check the firehouse where you got the original? It let us in the first time right? before being upgraded?
---
Alot of quests are triggered by wandering around
---
Did you grab the new veil off the body?
---
I literally never played a fallout game before this. Had no idea that quest could've provided a different level gun. I was just trying to do all the quests I could for xp.

Click on marker categories, then the red ! for quests. It will show quest locations.

"In Search Of" with Leonard Nimoy hosting was my favorite. That guy whose prized possession was a Bigfoot turd in a glass display case.... :D
---
How we gonna have factions with 24 person servers? 6 person factions?  Lol i am not excited about any pvp changes in 2019.
---
I realize im intentionally being a jerk when i smash camps.... Kind of... It costs next to nothing to rebuild them. I dont feel sorry for the guys who dont defend their camps from me and my buddys camp raids. Then just stand there and make emojis? Server hop sooner, i wont follow. 
---
Put your generators inside or on the roof. The noise attracts enemies even if you’re not on a spawn. 
---
Oh. Right. Didn’t know. Thanks :)
---
Is anyone else mildly irritated at the UI itself when comparing different windows? Like, I'm in a trade screen or camp construction menu, changing tabs is Z or C. OK, fine, weird but whatever. BUT, when I try to change tabs in the pip boy, it's W and S? Why the hell is that not Z and C also? Not to mention the smorgasbord of ways that Tab, Space, E and Enter are used interchangeably and also NON-interchangeably... 
---
The UI controls in this game are so god damn inconsistent it's ridiculous, it's like you had 4 different people designing shit and none of em talked to each other or bothered trying to get a common consensus on how anything should work!
---
It is kinda unfinished tbh
---
Copy and paste from an older thread
---
Watoga has 4 potential power armor spawns very close together. Starting in the transit station there is a level 3 locked room with the chance for a spawn, the next one is on the roof of the emergency services building. The roof access is 2 floors above the elevator, stairs are to the right when entering the building, the armor would be on the right as you exit to the roof. Then across from there there are two buildings connected by a bridge with vertibirds crashes on each roof get up on the one on the left either by jumping across or by going down and using the fire escape to get up and cross the bridge to right hand building. The power armor spawns beside the vertibird. The last is is beside the vertibird that is crashed in the street, beside the AMS HQ. Watoga usually has a lot high level players and the armor may be already spawned at a higher level than what you’re wanting when you get there. 
---
Ya kept your god, damn, faith son. Loyalty.
---
I'm not ox
---
Maybe because you going there every day, try don't go there for 3 days and then try it. Also there are loads of other places for plastic. Watoga High School has loads, also there is a place on there west side of the map, near the workshops, never been there myself, but has a ton of plastic, Cola World or something .. basically mix up your route, I find, if I don't go to a place for 3-5 days it repopulates ..That is probably too long, but it should populate in days and not weeks or you hit a bug where it thinks you were there recently.
---
There is loads of plastic all over, even plastic from picking up cigarets .. just tag it and you will find it all over, literally everyplace has plastic and most things have some form of plastic .. even top of the world by rose has tons of plastic plates, there is they BBQ place that has loads of plastic plates, instead of sticking to open place, hit other places, I rarely have problems finding plastic. Why do you need plastic, for bulking ?
---
No, I left the scorch beasts there. I never attacked them. It turned out that the ammo was "hidden" within the extractor. I found that this happens with all extractors, water purifiers, legendaries, and other loots. 
---
The New year's stuff was far more reasonable in terms of pricing. 
---
Ah, I’m only 32
---
That would seem terrible. However, what about if you have to purchase a plan or a thing from the shop to build a vendor stall. If it's an extension of your camp, would you not open up your camp to threats of people raiding and causing mischief to the entire vendor locale?
---
Wait, they patched plasma rifles? As in the hitboxing works properly now?
---
Warframe doesn't have down time to be fair.
---
Seems there's reason for it though. You can find audio recordings in the bunker from before. Prior to a... certain incident... he didn't have those pauses.
---
Omg why couldn't I have seen this yesterday!
---
Thank you!  Take all of my upvotes! 
---
Well... Yeah. If it employs robots and not vending machines it will probably cost to repair them and then this falls into the if it can be destroyed do you get what they were selling?

Either you've not spent your special pts to be level 29 or your blind.
---
How long ago did you see the level 500? I'm getting close to 500 and would like to know how far away I'm likely to be.
---
Do you remember their name?
---
Need to be a dick about it
---
I mean it's getting close to a month with 0 changes or fixes with exploiters running wild and peoples games crashing all the time (I don't personally have any problems with the game crashing but I don't doubt others arent as lucky). It must be a very small amount of people working on 76 if they haven't been able to get some fixes out in all this time. They really shouldn't have released the game in November if their team is so small and everyone was going to take so much time off for the holidays.
---
Quite understandable. The only highend gameplay suddenly is gone. That's why I play to farm stuff like three star legendaries and fluxes. The rest is so boring, so unincentivizing that it is just promoting one to log out. So yeah I can especially why this happens.
---
Just keep stacking that dps. Broken af. [https://i.imgur.com/vcd1OdI.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/vcd1OdI.jpg)
---
It's not GUN weight reduction, it's WEAPON weight reduction. Grenades are also affected. This makes this even more powerful.
---
Likewise, ammo weight reduction also applies to fusion cores because they're ammo for the gatling laser. There is a limit that weight can be reduced by armor and perks. I believe it's 4 armor pieces affecting the same category and legendary weight reduction doesn't seem to stack with maxed out perks.
---
I got the notification as "Dear Bethesda, can VATS" and I thought that was a great idea
---
I'll updoot - its a good idea

Durability is tied to damage I think. So it's your fault for shredding with them.
---
I think it's rare for them to be there. I have only seen 2 so far but I always check once daily as I'm doing a caps run selling items. Ya 19k caps is way too much for me, level 86 and only have 8k caps lol.
---
Very nice job! I'm only level 20 but there's an achievement for making it to level 100 but after that I don't see the point. Diablo has a really good paragon level system which actually makes a big impact and it feels good "restarting" to level faster again for a period of time
---
I don't think it could ever be a camp extension due to griefers and raiders
---
&gt; DO NOT bulk acid! It will end up weighing 1.5 x as much.
---
However, if you bulk acid it takes 10 but unbulks to 15 acid.  50% gain for a little plastic.  If you are an ammo whore like me who has to smelt massive piles of lead and steel ores, this is worthwhile.
---
Did you kill a Responder Vendor Bot earlier today?)
---
It is early access beta, people who paid for a AAA release are justifiably pissed. Once it is in a release state the hate will go away.
---
I know. It’s a joke.
---
His pauses remind me of the G-Man.
---
I have 9 luck points
---
Could be a thing. To have to come back to defend your vendor bot from a raider party of 4 people with TSE weapons doesnt sound fun. 
---
Action boy has no affect when wearing power armour. Also with your TSE Gatling and demolition maxed out it will be easy mode with stupid amounts of damage, so it’s probably better to go with weight reduction and QoL perks. I would only invest 1 point into each heavy gunner perk to have optimal perk points to damage trade off. If you do want to maximise damage I would take off marathon/action boy and replace with adrenaline. 
---
I saw a couple people last night, I don't remember which one was the 500. But one was named Sol and the other one was named Tos. Looked like they were duping.
---
So he Exploit the game to the point the DPS breaks the PVP Formula?
---
If you run a bloodied build unyielding is really good
---
Got the Stealth Boy one in the first shot.  I then discovered I lacked the flux needed to make it.  While waiting to run a nuke zone.. I ran myself out of steel while building.  
---
You all know what happened next.
---
:(
---
We need this so damn badly!!!
---
Suppressors are usually one of the last mods to unlock from scrapping- i think learned mods are weighted for rarity and those have a very small % chance to hit when you scrap something.
---
Ah, thanks.  I was in a pinch yesterday and ended up eating a bunch of it.  I was lucky enough not to get any diseases and had the perk to purge radiation and was just wondering if it might be made any better.
---
literally the cheapest thing i have ever seen in a game hey man its supposed to be hard right so how about we just cover your whole screen in blue shit and get you epilepsy triggerflash is that cheap.. uhh hard enough?
---
I'm not into it. That's not how shit works in real life. You don't just grab a bunch of electronic components and after a while of messing around suddenly "Eureka! I've learned how to make a blood clensing mod for my power armour".
---
I don't mind one where you breakdown and item with a mod or just one of the mod boxes for a chance to learn it (with higher intelligence to improve chances).
---
Kinda makes me sad because I doubt even 10% of these will be implemented. 
---
I didn't say stabilized wasn't far and away the best heavy weapons perk. I am saying heavy weapons need a major overhaul at a fundamental level because rapid weak attacks simply does not work in this game. The way the armor system is designed means alpha strike damage is the king, and no amount of dps will make up for bad alpha damage.
---
The lmg and minigun will always be flaming dumpster fire weapons, because they have the worst alpha strike damage in the game, a rolling pin will out damage them for crying out loud. However a heavy weapon with strong alpha strike damage, such as the gatling gun works wonders, and is able to handle threats reliably on par with other weapons reliably, out damaging every other heave weapon by an outrageous margin even without the stabilized perk while every other heavy weapon has it. The fact it has 80 base damage per shot means it will at a base level outdamage a  fully perked out minigun against any medium level enemy or above. This isn't taking into account the gatling is accurate and stable on it's own.
---
The perk itself isn't the problem with heavy weapons, you can have good heavy weapons that don't need the perk to get by, Bethesda just needs to actually make some. 
---
You and I will have to agree to disagree, then.  I loved Travis so much I've never done the quest to give him confidence.  "WHY!?!?  DO OBJECTS?!?!? KEEP MOVING!?!?!? ....... because I move them.... and I forget...."
---
Truly a bizarre world we live in. I had no idea people sold services to be a TSE mercenary. Intriguing says the scorch lady
---
I have a prime hunting rifle receiver. Sure would be nice if it was worth a damn
---
Reddit. 
---
Either there or Whitesprings Resort interior most likely from what I've seen
---
Pacifist mode exist. 
---
Which plan gives these?
---
I have 
---
Strength 15 
---
Perception 5 
---
Endurance 4 
---
Charisma 3 
---
Intelligence 13 
---
Agility 7 
---
Luck 9
---
I have not used glitches to get to my level 
---
Delete duped items.
---
I'm in the same boat I've heard alot about how it's taken out of vendor loot tables after 44 but I've tried farming patrol duty but no luck on seeing the event in any of my lobbies 
---
&gt; Have perception increase range damage like strength increases melee damage.
---
A straight up damage boost like this is definitely not a quality of life change. In fact, most of your suggestions are not quality of life changes. Additional content, reworks, etc. are not quality of life.
---
I'm not saying these aren't good suggestions, but they shouldn't be labeled as something they aren't.
---
WHEN I SAY SO!
---
Yeah!  It's so annoying.  It's no different than any fallout since 1 in that respect.  There were always houses you couldn't go in and many many that you could.  No different in 76.
---
Please go post on the r/market76 subreddit. It'll gain more traction
---
Lol who did you piss off?
---
I ended up deleting the character (lv 30ish) and starting anew. The game was also giving achievements for performing certain tasks while under the influence but my character hadn't had anything but water for days.
---
It was bug after bug after bug.
---
All serious investors  expect you to be lean, iterative, ship early to reassure them using real user feedback that you’re not using their money to build parts of the product nobody wants or needs. 
---
A live product lends itself much better to such a model than one with a huge complex set of story arcs like their single player titles, and they didn’t hold back on shipping early for this one. As someone who lives in this world, I actually find them to be a great textbook example of how this can be done aggressively, yes, piss a lot of people off, but now that the worse is (hopefully) begins us and they continue work while we’re on the product and guiding their priorities with our feedback, the mechanism for user—-feedback—developer that’s in place now is different planet superior for guiding their priorities, to the benefit of everyone - the product, us (otherwise we wouldn’t even see it for another 2 years!), them and their investors. 
---
I can see the vending machines in the basement area of Whitesprings where the shops are. Un-nukable. Static, requiring a fee to load with items. When you log off, your items go with you freeing up the machine for someone else. When you log in a machine is populated with your items, if one is available. In ESO you can't sell to other players unless your in a guild. I'm sincerely hoping that won't be the case in 76. 
---
Though I'd much prefer vendors at our camp with location markers and free fast travel. That's what I'm crossing my fingers for. They should let us sell veggies &amp; flowers that don't degrade on a vendor. That way if it's nuked you get the flux version.
---
&gt;premium-priced product
---
Lol $60 isn't premium. Pretty standard for video games, imo...
---
Either way, it's very clear that you're taking BGS and Bethesda Softworks' mistakes *way* too personally. 
---
TBH it’s a hard game to enjoy 45m at a time.  It has a slow core loop with a lot of tedious steps.  Conversely, can be very engaging when you are in the world for hours at a time.
---
  I’d suggest a more streamlined action game if 45m is typical of your playtime? 
---
Junk extractors. Get your camp at one. Then go grab the Charleston landfill. After an afternoon you'll have enough to get by. Do this for a few days and you will be selling bulk screws to your friends.
---
That can't be the only cause of it. I had it happen with stairs.
---
Yeah, I can echo this survey. I've managed to get the stealth boy, targeting HUD (buggy as hell and not worth it but that's another story), and the calibrated shocks after 3 days of server hopping over a weekend. I only saw reactive plating once but wasn't interested. Jet pack was rare but not super rare. I uninstalled the jetpack for the stealth boy.
---
The targeting HUD was by far the rarest (more so than the shocks since I got those 3 times)
---
Nukes can be fired again.
---
Can you buy me dinner tonight?
---
Yep. Either that or we face the equally troubling possibility that all of the robots in the bunker are self aware.
---
Talk to the sentry bots, they're a real riot. D:
---
No, you'll never get it. Because God hates you.
---
Maybe he's forgetting to share it? I haven't experienced that but I wouldn't be surprised if that happens. 
---
you say everyone bitched about FO76 like they haven’t lived through bugs and glitches before. That’s no excuse man. This was released as a $60 AAA game with bugged quests, caps exploits, XP exploits, duping exploits that still exist and crash servers, server crashes that happened very often and still do to many people, an unrewarding end game loot system, the atomic shop, I mean come on. I’m not even listing everything. List everything on top of what I’ve already mentioned- this is a sham as a AAA $60 game. An absolute sham.  You can admit you like the game and that it’s bad at the same time. I liked the MMORPG called “Rift,” it failed terribly and there were many things about the game that was bad but I still loved it. 
---
Same here. These idiots don't know what they are talking about.
---
OMG I just love you. That is exactly one of my most desired things to build in camps. Thx thx thx
---
I'd rather venture outside of WS instead of seeing another Golf Course. I used to live basically on top of one irl and now that's all I see in game for the most part. A new area with a reason to get away from leveling and farming for weapons would be great.
---
I know, but I keep it off for quick bounty hunting or when people want to pvp. I don't think this is a horrible request. People can keep their camps in white springs it just bugs me when its right outside the golf house
---
Brotherhood of Steel heavy combat armor is the best set for DR and ER. You can learn the Brotherhood of Steel combat armor upgrade from the 2 vendors in Grafton, one at the station and another in the city. Server hop for a few hours and check both vendors, then you will eventually have BoS chest, legs and arms. The upgrade works for all the different types of combat armor(Light, Sturdy, Heavy). The Brotherhood of Steel upgrade, is the best one for combat armor. You can farm legendary heavy combat armor pieces by doing the Watoga Highschool Monster Mash event.
---
It sets an electric trap on the ground so they’ll walk into it but Ive never used it on enemies before because the damage just wasn’t high enough to use 
---
You can't trade this item. It's only a temporarily worn item during the Monster Mash event.
---
We don't need this. Disagree
---
Duh,  that's what mentats are for...
---
Strangler blooms always spawn for me near the Gulpers at that Chemical plant. Hope this helps 
---
Enable pacifist mode, fire a couple of shots into the front door, then wait for everything to start pouring out.  Their camp will just sit there all useless until the next person nukes it.
---
Do daily patrol event at the prison, it'll be an award. That's how I got mine @ 55. 
---
Yes, I was disappointed when I realized the d-pad was not the same as Fo4. That system was easy to use/memorize
---
You were on about this last night too.  You're so absurdly stupid and wrong.  You are very lucky breathing is involuntary, I'm guessing.
---
The game offers you a feature to fix the problem you are having bud, if you are not cognizant enough to use it, that's mostly you're fault, it takes two clicks to turn off and on. :/
---
Those wendigos don’t stand a chance against my stealth gunslinger build! 
---
/r/unexpectedpawnee
---
I thought I had been one shot pacifist killed until a few days later when I was thinking about it and realised I was at a workshop.
---
Yes. Some low radiation with some spikes when there is lightning, and everything tinted green. They are amazing, but I've only seen 2.
---
that'd be more doable, if I'd stop getting t-45 motion assist servos every damned time
---
Telling friendlies and hostiles apart while targetting was a perk you had to take in the original Fallouts.
---
Great insight on the suppression.  Some of the mutations makes a lot more sense with the strategy. 
---
I feel like whitesprings would be overhauled a bit, with no ghouls and more bots/butlers (also being nuke-free).
---
Maybe those houses with the hand scanners could be rented out?
---
THE TREES! THEYRE IN THE FUCKING TREES!
---
Mind you, those chickens look pretty tough. Not dared to tangle with one yet.
---
Not on console it a whole ordeal of manuvering menus
---
It’s Like a puddle of electric blue stuff 
---
Fallout 3 came out in 2008 and Skyrim in 2011. The bugs and glitches weren’t as big of a deal back then. It’s 2019 now man. FO76 was released in an unacceptable state. The game is bad.
---
Ok ty
---
Or so you thought 
---
I just don't like the look of the wired windows. Plus, I dislike the interior finish on the brick walls - the exterior is so much nicer. If they were red brick inside and out the brick walls would be pretty great.
---
So I used to place there for months... However, I didn't have turrets. I only used it for a break down and store location. 
---
I do have to agree that I loathe fortress of turrets.... It sucks farming and have to contend with those turrets.  
---
I am sure they were not aiming for me.  That was when my camp was a little too close to the golf course.
---
It was moving day after that.  :)
---
Yeah Bethesda is def known for bugs in all of their games. Skyrim was probably the next most buggy for me but I have 50x more issues with FO76. I was lucky enough to be stuck in PA for weeks, rolled a new character for him to get stuck too, that means no crafting, no fighting really no playing for weeks. Server instability is terrible, I get dropped at least a few times per day. It got loads better after the carry weight fix but it is still bad, presumably duping.
---
Maybe you aren't having as many of the bugs or maybe I am unlucky but the experience up until that last big patch was def early access type stuff.
---
Sometimes it just having your camp at the wrong place, at the wrong time.
---
For example, having a camp on the whitesprings golf course is just asking for it.
---
Since you haven't gotten the plan, the game recognizes you can't place it. You might want your friend to place it down again for you.
---
Prove me wrong.
---
Betheada "patched" that. You can't place something a friend built for you if you don't also have the plans for it. Just scrap it cuz otherwise it'll take up space in your stored items and get them to build you a new one, or do the powering up poseidon event a few times to unlock it yourself.
---
1) Legendary Hunting Rifles and Pipe Revolvers  
---
2) The outfits from dead raiders, let us have those!
---
I always check for a player being inside the symbol, that's usually an indicator of such, and sometimes I hide them in the loot containers in the liberator infested parking lot, or put them in the responder bodies too
---
You can no longer pick up and put back down items you don't have the plan for.  Your friend is going to have to build one again.  You can move them, just not store and replace them.
---
Where is the Atom skin for the Flamer that has a Dragon head covering the end of the gun barrel? Or a Power Fist skin shaped like a Nuka Cola that makes the sound of you opening one up every time you punch?
---
Back online
---
added, same as reddit
---
Every now and again the event glitches and the mask isn't taken from the player's inventory, and can be dropped. 
---
Thats the the other thing, as soon as I spawn the turrets start taking out mobs
---
Is this still a thing?  I warned someone about it yesterday and then I thought, they must have fixed that by now, right?
---
I’d just like to be able to display Bobbleheads &amp; possibly all the teddy bears I have collected haha. I don’t like putting shelves down as they look so bare :(
---
The whole map is full of gruesome finds like this. Love it. 
---
I was literally about to make a pissed-off Reddit post about this
---
Consider putting 3 points into charisma and slapping on tenderizer for nuke zones and areas where lots of enemies spawn.
---
haha, maybe that was the problem. I got him all "confident" and that was annoying. 
---
Best solution is at least one rank of Born Survivor in the Agility cards. At rank one you automatically use a stimpack when you hit 20% health. 
---
I knew there was a glitch for it, but you can trade it? Does it stay in your inventory?
---
i really didnt understand the wire stuff aswell.  
---
it works if the light is near a wall connector, which needs to be wired to a generator. 
---
No, but I'd like to trade with it for sure.
---
Mine is similar, for both rp reasons and because base-building is one of the most challenging mechanics in the game (and FO4 for that matter) to me. Just thought I'd share because I saw it here and have the same problem.
---
The lights don't need wires to them just a connector near them when you place the connector any lights that glow white will be powered by it 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a9e6zd/ps4_still_have_monster_mask
---
That was just a quick google search, you can also look on YouTube 
---
Fair enough, I'm agility and strength type build so I was able to grab all of it. I offered it back but he did respond to me talking or grab the bag when I tried to give it back so idk, now I feel like I ruined someone's fun 
---
Xbox is back as well.
---
-Science master/expert etc... Perhaps effect repairs on energy weapons? 
---
-Science cards making energy weapons durability last longer or increase energy weapon damage by 5%(example) per card. 
---
Ammo usage for cryolator vs crafting requirements for ammo. Either make ammo cheaper or more damage.
---
-Make ultracite weapons use same mods as normal of same type. Ultracite weapons arent that much better to justify the time crafting and brraking down for mods. 
---
I have a ton of salt for when Bethesda adds in mutant snails/slugs. 
---
You need to connect those conduits to a generator before they will pump out any signal.
---
Yes please +1
---
Somewhere, the all-super mutant revival of the hit performance group Stomp is missing a member and is very sad.
---
I was placing plants the other day and they kept ending up on the roof. Not sure if that's really the issue here or even helpful. But walking away from my camp I saw like a dozen plants on the roof that I thought kept disappearing after I placed it. Maybe it's populating somewhere else in your camp
---
I am both loving and thouroughly disgusted by that analogy.
---
Kudos.
---
Also apparently the frame itself has 60 damage/energy/radiation resistance, which is pretty good at low levels.
---
I know I can use pacifist I just dont like it enabled since I have fun in pvp and like to bounty hunt. It isn't as quick to enable/disable pacifist on console as it is on pc
---
Mother fuckers
---
Ok thanks. He said it’s a pretty material heavy plan. Thanks for the help
---
Yeah my name's mazemagic on there :)
---
I know this is an old post, but I came here looking for cranberry locations.  I found a nice little spot just directly south of Watoga Train station at a place called "**Sunrise Field**".  It is a very convenient spot for anyone in that part of the map.
---
It wasn't a problem in the beta and if someone placed 3000 radios, they would probably have bricked their game as they would crash at their camp and then crash every time the spawn and I don't think anyone is going to do that 
---
I have the same issue with a power armor workstation. I fixed it by removing the upper floor/roof first, then placed it. Then i put the roof/floor back. Probpem solved.
---
If you're so hardcore into the game that you care about those seconds lost, you should be skilled enough to quickly change your settings in 2 seconds, if you lose a bounty that quickly, you're doing something wrong. As for jacking kills, use their CAMP for your own purposes and just tag shit and let the CAMP finish it for you, just an efficient use of supplies and time there. 
---
When I first started I was able to build a radio and place it, but it didn't play music when switched on.  Wonder if that's why they pulled it?
---
Good to know it’s on another platforms, I figured it would be. I know it’s a minor issue but man it bugs me. 
---
you're\*
---
One of the community managers edited their comment to take out "release patch notes soon after" so I guess we will never know. 
---
Depends on your build. Mine is a stealth gunslinger so what I use is a bolt action pipe pistol and it gets the job done. 
---
Updated and edited.
---
To each their own. I keep my fusion generator in its own house powering thru a window 
---
Incisor and martial artist perks are your new best friend. Level those bitches up all the way for 75% armor piercing, 40% faster swing rate and less weight
---
That’s a wild left turn at the end, friend, but otherwise sounds like most people don’t find the searching for food, water and avoiding enemies as tedious as I do, I guess
---
 Great list but when it comes to weapon balance please change energy weapons. Laser rifles are so weak and break to fast. Plasma weapons with server lag are very hard to use unless the enemies are standing still and even then its still hard to to tell if you hit them. I'd be alright if there was a perk that just helped reduce breakage and gave some sort of benefit. Theres perks that help roleplay as all sorts of builds but there really isnt one that allows energy weapons builds at least that I'm aware of.
---
By the way, the "New Years Event" wasn't a real event, just a PR tweet, and the disabling of nukes was an unrelated glitch
---
Ive been one-shot one time by a low level guy. I was at the toxic lake or whatever its called at toxic valley up north. I was standing around and i saw a guy with the [Faschnacht Man mask](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Faschnacht_Man_mask) come running towards me with a pool cue. I cant remember his exact level, but he was a low level. He one shot me with the damn pool cue.
---
Right on I’m in the process of solving alpha I’ll send you a request when ever it’s solved either by me or Mika crypt and I’ll run you through it
---
❤
---
Per day per person would even do the job.
---
Yup.  I've run into rain in the Savage Divide and the Mire, not so much in the Forest and Toxic Valley.  I wonder if some areas are more inclined to get certain types of weather than others.
---
Pretty sure power was glitched in the beta. I had one in my camp and it worked fine off the get go but there were some times where I would need to store it and replace it because it would say it wasn't receiving power
---
Idk, i spent my first few hours grabbing everything, spent all my travel time overencumbered basically, because i was discovering locations anyway and had nowhere to fast travel to. Once the quests started looping me back around to fast travel, i cleared out space and now had a decent nest egg built up from my collection early.
---
Not saying it's a good way to go about things, but honestly, it's not bad.
---
I remember New Vegas' launch, oh boy
---
Graham can sell it at any level just low chance. You can it reward for Uranium Fever and the Robot Patrol Mission at the Prison.
---
If your on Xbox I can sell u one. I farm them with a low level Alt Character.
---
T45 starts at 25
---
Alright I was hoping the marine armor was just bugged into being bad or I was missing something. Too bad I don't really face many energy attacks besides scorchbeasts and assaultrons which I'm putting power armor on for scorch beasts because it's suicide for my character without it. And assaultrons are easy if you just sneak attack to death from long range. (in case your wondering I'm a sniper build.)
---
I love the GraftonMayor
---
I stand corrected.
---
That's probably why I don't play most games!  Although I'm pretty sure most games have better quest design that this.
---
I'm guessing it has some sort of anti-cheat dependency that they can't seem to quiet rework at this point for the reason duping hasn't been fixed already.  Their recent adjustment to cap how many items you can make to 250 did absolutely nothing to stop it with the work around to that 'cap', 300 still seems to be the magic number that triggers something to rollback causing the dupe possible scenario.  Maybe they should of did something like once you make 250, you have a 24 hour cool down timer to craft anything else as a way to better stop the scenario from happening?
---
&gt; You don't need any materials to add a mod to anything.
---
True.
---
Why not just have icons on the map designating a player vendor?  It doesn't matter where they are.. someone eventually is gonna nuke it just cuz
---
He was doing the DPS Exploit.
---
Yet another reason as to why pistols are horrific. 
---
Considering that they are now probably focusing on FO76, I doubt any DLCs or additional content will come to FO4 from Bethesda. It might be better for you to find a mod.
---
This so much.
---
I dont always use my headset and would like to retain basic communication.
---
If your life is anything like fo76 I gotta say I'm sorry for you
---
To be fair, that's exactly what the Vault Boy trailers implied you should be doing with the nukes.  Someone offends you?  Nuke 'em!
---
You know people who dupe but you don't take it upon yourself to report them to Bethesda? You must be a duper yourself. Welcome to the family!
---
Not even close. If you compare onlinegames his game has the best lot story telling I've played and I've played like 12 MMOs lol
---
Yeah, I appreciate this compilation effort, but every single “community consensus” request for music is bullshit. I DO NOT want anything removed or changed, and neither does anyone I play with. We just want more precious Fallout songs added.
---
I saw this once from a distance near crevasse dam. It was actually pretty delightful, theyre kinda cute and it gave them some personality to see them doing that.
---
Lolwat
---
By the time I created another toon to level 15, and got him to harpers- that was legit 10x faster then the amount of time I lost server hopping looking for the Prison event.
---
I wish they’d have separate budgets for turrets and building components. I understand the issue is that active items such as turrets, could place a strain on the servers. I don’t mind defences being limited, but would like to build more elaborate bases.
---

Okay I went from full raider to the excavator to X01. 
---
Because pounds are not the issue, number of distinct items is.  My 100 bulk gears on mule count as one unique item with quantity 100.  If it was 100,000,000 bulk gears it would not add any additional network traffic, but would weigh significantly more.
---
Yeah, I have burns and scars all over. Fits with my 20% hp 80% rads char.

You look like my mother.

If you are near a workshop the chance is higher to see him, thats a known fact that he will visit workshops.
---
Just north of the Asylum, there is a junk node just over the hill by the side of the road. It has been my main spot since I found it. It is pretty much dead center of all the faction vendors, so fast travel costs are fairly low. There are a few copper deposits on the cliff just outside my base, a crashed truck that occasionally spawns a stealth boy, two lead nodes within walking distance, the monorail elevator is nearby to collect fusion cores and concrete. radstag, beavers, squirrels, and other fauna spawn right behind my base. It really is the best spot on the map I think.
---
I think reading the comments this far has encouraged me to re-try the camp / do more with making weapons and armor, since I find that enjoyable in these types of games. Thanks!
---
Yeah the strategy makes empath one of the best mutations 
---
I'm not saying to team up in a sense. But if the lore from both games could be somehow linked it would be pretty interesting. 
---
There should even be a dlc where the aliens (outer worlds) go to earth and try to (and successfully) destroy the Bethesda headquarters it ends off with having to gain access to the Pentagon and launching the nukes to China meaning America shot first  and thus started off the great war and the events or fallout 1 and 2. Kinda a digital middle finger to Bethesda.
---
I'm not hardcore, just into having fun. Letting thier CAMP finish kills isn't fun. But sneaking around killing enemies without getting caught is for me. As far as me lerning to switch quickly; yeah that's an option, I've tried that method. The problem is I forget to switch off pacifist and then my enemy now has a heads up that I'm there. Defeats the purpose of a stealth build. 
---
I completely agree with you I also use speed demon hahaha
---
What system do you play on
---
Thanks man!
---
Probably hard to tell because I assume everyone that got caught by this bug probably immediately sold/scrapped the head so they didn't nuke themselves again.
---
haha well i guess i'm using them properly then

what do tesla coils mod do?
---
How long ago did she pass away?
---
And do the top floor floor segments snap to these stairs?
---
yup. I have lost at least 1000 caps a d countless gears and springs to the server.

Yeah same, I only ever get trash 
---
About 7ish, 8ish years ago? I dunno. I'm just going off of what my brother told me.
---
No, but you can buy weapons that are massively above your level with gold, which you can buy with real money
---
Don't bother trying to repair plants at your camp.  Scrapping them gives you back a 1:1 supply of what you need to re-plant it, as opposed to the 5:1 (or whatever it is) to repair them.
---
I think people would have been more understanding if the rum was actually quality. I have not tasted, but have watched some pretty bad reactions from people who typically know their spirits. It apparently tastes like a coconut is trying to chloroform you. Very disappointing since the same bottling company licensed a whisky for William Shatner that's supposed to be delicious.
---
I always queue it but no one else ever does.  Have yet to play it.
---
I keep waiting for him to slip up and call me Mr Freeman. 
---
Well when you got that fortnite / rockstar money you can tell the magazines and reviewers to write whatever

The plan comes from completing "powering up &lt;powerplant name&gt;" missions.. any of the 3 i think?  You'll get all the generator plans that way.
---
That makes sense.  I probably didn't even consider getting into my power radius.
---
Nah, she’s annoying as hell to me.
---
Do you lose caps when killed?
---
It's been by far the best FO for roleplaying your own character. 
---
That's where some of my favourite bits have come in. 
---
Even playing solo. My first character was a naive tourist wandering around WV taking pictures at landmarks. 
---
My second is an elderly lady who is a water and junk farmer. She's set up in a pretty nice little spot, and she ain't giving it up for nothing. 
---
Especially not that bastard death claw a little ways off. We have an understanding/viciously bloody fued. 
---
It would be faster if you just create an alt and once you hit 15 fast travel to Harpers. It was there first go for me which I found hilarious. Only issue is you need a friend to trade the plans with and hold until you log your main char.
---
Yeah now that you say that youre totally spot on
---
I think the Voice of Set can be recrafted to increase the level (using itself as a crafting ingredient, so don't lose it). Same with the Blade of Bastet, and probably others.
---
If you've ever worked a retail job for shitty pay you would have known what I meant.
---
Did they fix the bug with those heads? I thought they currently eat up all the ammo you have at once.
---
"For the love of god people! Stop farming whitesprings and shooting my camp!"
---
I'd like to add a small shared stash, to allows us to quickly and easily transfer weapons and ammo between characters without having to bother other players with these logistic nonsense. Borderlands 2 for example had this, Claptrap's Stash. And Elder Scrolls Online has an entire bank that's shared. 
---
Maybe everything in the mire hangs from trees because all the bats went underground.
---
So if I know people who tell me they dude, yet I've never witnessed such a thing, nor have any other proof, I should blindly start reporting people to Bethesda? That's called heresay in the legal world, my friend. And lmao @ "you must be a duper yourself." That's like the default assumption and insult around here. Can't come up with a valid argument? Just call someone a duper!  
---
Maybe you're calling me a duper to deflect from the fact that your'e a duper yourself!
---
You try entering them into nukacrypt.com ?
---
He visits all the workstations, and his path takes like 30-60 minutes.  SO pick a spot, hang out and wait.  You'll find him.
---
I think weapons in rdr2 online are level locked.
---
Id also like to see a Lost and Found feature that ha Scavenger robots collect discarded or lost quest rewards... Maybe with a fee or something. It course you can have only 1 copy of the item in your inventory or stash
---
learned my lesson after gta online ,never bought another cockstar game
---
Good read, thanks!
---
They play some classical music.  I've got one going in my camp.  
---
That's hilarious!  Too bad mod servers aren't on yet... then you could get hold of the mod that replaces the heads of the statues with Todd Howard as well.  Your church would be perfect.
---
Counterpoint: have your camp be extremely simple and mobile in the beginning. One foundation with a box and a bench. Then feel free to grab everything you want and just move your camp nearby when you really have no other options.
---
If your friend engaged in any sort of pvp it will flag you for pvp as well. Assuming your friend didn't accidently flag you then yes he probably used an exploit to kill you. 
---
I regularly try to find lower level players to give extra plans to. Some take them, but a lot run from me. Most people here are nice, give us a shot. 
---
Yeah, but can you pull this off?
---
https://youtu.be/F-MAXwzwST4
---
I call it the 'scorched giraffe neck mutation."
---
You should do the same data gathering for the power armor plans at the Watoga shopping center shop!
---
They have one slot for a plan that is randomized. It is mostly the same two mods, but I have seen plans for T-60/T-51b/T-45 jetpacks, stealth boys, etc
---
Inventory management.
---
Its a known bug, they said that it will be fixed....but we dont known how much that will be :)
---
Yea I’m going to have to find a good set and get the perk that helps with repairing. 
---
I never considered this and my character is hardcore addict, thanks for the heads up! Also consider the perk that increases the duration of chems if you don't have so many flux to spare or just wanna try this out.
---
Also, which silo are you going for? I’m working on alpha have 4 of 8 pieces so far
---
Mostly hunting rifle. I can't recall if I've seen this with other rifles.
---
Agreed.... Definitely a nuisance at them early levels. The Gatling scream attack is soooooo aggravating. 
---
I go attract scorch beasts when I see a camp there 
---
The rifle perks do affect the tesla rifle.  Heavy weapons perk does not affect it.  I have both perks and verified in game.
---
i dont remember where i was but i seen a glowing wendigo yesterday and ran for my life
---
There was a new year's event? Shit, shows me for having gone out. What was it?
---
U/descendent1784 made a good list of what drains. 
---
When I tried with 50 cells, it didn't take all. So most likely they have.
---
I don't even have any letters yet to decrypt the code pieces with. Not sure how long it will take to get them
---
Help the guy running the [https://nukacrypt.com/solved](https://nukacrypt.com/solved) website decode them 
---
he is streaming here [https://www.twitch.tv/realpuresavagery](https://www.twitch.tv/realpuresavagery)
---
I've seen someone recently posting looking for it, and then posting a thank you with a screenshot of it, so I can only assume that it can be traded one way or another. I have one myself, but never tried to trade it.
---
If you don’t know about the lumber yard by vault 76, know it now!  Best way to get low level ticks killed for tick blood for making stimpacks.
---
Make healing salve instead of stimpacks when you can’t afford them. How to make them? Walk down the river in flatwoods, (in a hazmat suit or power armor) and gather all the blood leaf and soot flower you can. Button smash “collect dirty water” , find the cooking station where opossums always spawn, and cook there. 
---
Also, by the little garden there, you’ll find the tents where there’s two radstags hanging. They always spawn for meat whenever you log in. You can cook there too.
---
I'm definitely gunna try this I've been checking the prison so often only saw patrol duty once in my 79 lvls 
---
I forgot to link it above, but this post has some of the most useful info you'll ever find!  It definitely made my life in Appalachia easier.

---
Nothing special. Bethesda jusy said "hey everyone meet up at the bar in the Whitespring to party!"
---
Then (not confirmed, but im pretty sure) they shut of nukes since the whitespring is a popular nuke site and they didnt want lower level players getting screwed trying to make it to the "party".
---
I quit playing because of dupers and glitch users. It’s always an excuse for them, something like, “I’m not hurting the game” or some crap. You are ruining the game. I played religiously for the first week, but the cheating, the pvp server lag, the dupers- it’s just not worth playing anymore to me. love the game, despise the cheaters.
---
They do.  You can add floors to any level
---
Sugar or honey doesn't work as well, but works too. Always got some sugar on my hot bar since it's easy to get.
---
Unfortunately, yes. If you aren't present or viewing through a camera, it's generally a coin toss. The only other solution is to regularly empty your workshop into a container, then the attack rating will be minimized, and you'll "win" a lot more defenses.
---
Yep, came across this on my first character, they were in the trees man, in the trees!
---
should probably put that in your flair. 
---
I’ll do what I want with MY game. Especially considering there isn’t much else to do now.
---
Yes, basically. But I believe the codes are the same as last week, still posted on Nukacrypt
---
I just wander around looking for stuff.  After a while, I started looking for any location I haven't been to yet (on my compass).  If it's grey outline, havent been there.  I was finding a new one every hour, or so, but this past two weeks I find maybe 1 every other day.  So, I've probably only got a handful of undiscovered locations left.  But, I tend to enjoy just wandering around looking for new things to explore.
---
Most of my time is spent on some loot runs through whitesprings, or a few events, maybe some nuke drops.
---
They show up fairly often in level 3 safes.
---
heh, I did get carried away and forgot we needed new ones .
---
I got one on the way here - Alpha T-2 (I am at Charlie)
---
Took me aback too when I first saw it haha. 
---
Sloths make the ground shake slightly when they land too. Had one land behind me once when I was sneaking through some woods at night, scared the beejus at of me. Especially when you have no music, and hear the nightlife. Although Sloth "calls" are somewhat relaxing yet eerie xD
---
Some suggestions:
---
* Vats shouldn’t target non-hostiles (this includes merchants and any potential enemies who are conned gray to you, as well as turrets etc)
---
Why the fuck are you playing in the most popular area of the game with pacifist turned OFF?
---
Alternate statement: Scorch Beasts are an interesting challenge as a low level, because they will absolutely slaughter you. So you need to sneak, hide, or run when they show up.
---
They instill that fear in you, so that the first time you fight one and beat it, it feels like a genuine victory. You've been dodging this nemesis for 25-50 levels, and finally one day you're powerful enough to take one down. 
---
Get a farm going at your camp and just make soup, soup feeds and hydrates at the same time. I have recently started making blackberry juice, easy to make and everywhere you go there are blackberries. You could just drink boiled water if you want, easy to find and get. I agree it is tedious but once you have a farm and make soups and juice, gets easier. I also have 6 water pumps at my camp, so I collect purified water whenever I am back.
---
Epic.  now can't sleep :)
---
Yeah i always destroy bases near the golf course. Its the laziest way to steal kills so i have a instigating fat man just for the pesky campers that think they've got it all figured out. Couldnt give less of a shit for pacifist mode. I get messaged after consistently asking why, however i live for the salt so it only feeds me. 
---
Just a heads up, that’s 60lbs of just shotgun shells. Maybe it would be more beneficial to farm those spots when you need shells instead of stockpiling. 
---
I generally won’t go back to a site for at least three real-time days after I loot it. I never timed it properly but that seems about right. It’s also boring going back to the same places every time.
---
I’m curious, why do you think PA will be nerfed? 
---
So is "Server not responding...etc" a bi-product of people using this exploit. As I was having that message a ton today on Xbox. Actually stopped playing today due to so many server disconnects and that error popping up.
---
I don’t know. I would expect the opposite, staggering/crippling wings should stop them from flying. But it does seem to get worse all the time. Some SBs just seem to never want to land either, like they just fly in circles forever. Ive has 2-3 fighting at once, all but one will land an inevitably die. The last one just seems to stay up forever. 
---
Like pls make this happen the amount of times I have died cuz of not having this feature is crazy
---
Not the point of the post dumb fuck
---
Can't help stupid.
---
Ugh. I dumped a legendary head last night.
---
I don't think so...I think there were a few less 7's in last weeks alpha code so I would't waste my time trying that.
---
Even As a level 43, this was very helpful! Thanks!
---
You don't steal kills. You don't get exp if your player doesn't do dmg.
---
How about not targeting mines that I laid? Blew myself up during the fire breathers task that way. 
---
Or when they just fall out of view and you accidentally switch weapons or use a stimpak..
---
Yeah.. really wish that was the case.
---
Alright any plans I find I'll give you them. My GT is Silent PandoYo.
---
Dang, sounds like rdr2 needs some kind of offline play mode if it hopes to compete
---
Just trier last week code for silo Charlie and it didn’t work.  Unless I did a typo...
---
Get the bobblehead perk and it will alert you when one is close by, I wouldn't have found half of them without it, most are creatively hidden. Yesterday I found one, but I could see it even though it was right in front of me, only could see it in first person view.
---
They can be pretty spooky when you still aren't used to them!
---
I'm sorry for your loss, but at least she looks like a badass ghoul
---
It happened consistently to me usually when I was in a rush to fast travel.
---
Bandolier, my dude. My main problem is that I'm carrying like 50lbs of Nuka-Colas around AFTER the food weight perk. Display shelves pls.
---
you might just be overlooking them, or someone else has passed through before you and nabbed them.
---
oh SNAP
---
(Sound of the neck breaking)
---
How did you scrap ores? In the bench I haven't found ores in the section "materials"
---
Both perks are worthwhile.. white knight in agility to make it cost less, and fix it good in int for 200% durability which gives you more DR/ER
---
I have it but... I only use Ultracite PA now.
---
I'd just killed around 30 damned supermutants in the WestTek building. And they were tough. Didn’t get a chance to loot anything but a few hounds. Boo.
---
I wanna get turnt off some nuka rum my man! post apocalyptic pirate style! 
---
Cheers, mine is HenryFondle

Might I beg for it, if "mikesusz" declined it?  
---
My account on xbox is wictro (as it is everywhere)  
---
Perhaps just as bad is getting hit while in VATs with rifles and the like causes the UI to freak out and get you stuck for 5-7 seconds unable to do anything besides move and shoot.  It will reset itself if you kill the target, but in the case of scorched beasts it just hangs up and stays stuck for several seconds.
---
Definately not overlooking as I got so annoyed i watched youtube videos of the location. I wasn't aware others could take them and it would impact me, so this is probably the case? Thank you! Felt like i was going crazy 
---
Same. Ever since then I usually log into it before I start playing to see if they brought anything new in.
---
This argument is weird, only because it is on something objective and both sides are being upvoted (I use workshops and locks a lot, and don't know the answer myself). It's amazing, and unfortunate, that this game's extant mechanics are that up for debate.
---
Chemistry station, its in smelting.  Need acid.
---
There's several distinct ones. Production, medical, science, and military. Production sells the underarmor linings in a progressive manner e.g. treated&gt; resistant&gt; protective&gt; shielded. Also terminal, power armor station, and one other plan. Science sells serums. Medical sells recipe for radaway rad-x stim packs and antibiotics. 
---
Military wing sells x01 and scout armor mods, as well as plasma weapons and mods.
---
My condolences on all your previous shopping opportunities.
---
I had to stick a chair next to the wall people would get stuck in, they could sit in it, and then hop out. It was a dirty fix, but it works.
---
While wearing power armor or hazmat suit :) or taking a radx :)
---
That's fine, just don't get all salty if someone destroys your hard work or decides to greif you since they can do what they want with THIER game. 
---
The Juke Box plays classical music when placed within your camp.
---
The veil definitely protects against environmental hazards. I use it exclusively instead of a regular gas mask because it doesn't have the -2 perception.
---
Yeah I highly doubt they are the same. :/
---
To date they have been drowning in the issues that came up from what was probably an ill-advised launch. And “this year” is hardly inspiring. Let’s see vaults by the end of this month. If not, people are going to bail. 
---
I mean, i dont like when people make me second guess myself, but im pretty sure poppin a Daddy-O before blasting some ghoulies nets me a little more XP than if i didnt. Would also make sense as to why early on(lower INT), finding a location would net me 20-21XP, whereas now its like 25-26(higher INT). Also pretty sure thats how it worked in Fo4. Im pretty sure the difference is, again, missions/events/dailys give out a specific amount of xp, thus not affected, whereas kills/lockpicks/hacking/crafting XP are affected by a few factors.
---
Im pretty sure, but now i guess ill have to check.
---
Maybe bad RNG or you might be overlooking them. I have found several after overlooking them initially. I always go through a location at least twice just to make sure I didn’t miss anything and I almost always find something good on the second pass. 
---
I found a 3-star medic's flamethrower with reduced vats cost and something else once.... should've become a medic right then..
---
Depends which ones, copper is used for building stuff at your camp, so is iron. Others are for fixing stuff like guns etc. Each material generally has a use. I actually leave mine in misc, I think they lower weight in the ore form. Also some are used in daily tasks, if you smelt them, it will be the same as collecting them. E.g finding 0/5 coal, you smelt it and your have the daily done. Black Titanium for building PA etc.
---
I think he meant processing them at a chem station.
---
in context, I shot that scorched in the back of the neck with a Sniper Rifle. That was one hell of a .308 round.
---
Does that mean that Nukes are back on the menu?
---
I paid full prices months before release. The game has it's positives and negatives. Everyone has their on respective wants from this universe. I'm a huge fallout universe fan and spent 100+'s of hours in the fallout realm. I'm alright with people have their individual outlook on this title. A lot of people hate it due to how far they strayed away from single player quest drive adventure. 
---
I would have preferred a single player adventure though I've had a ABSOLUTE blast regarding team aspect with my close friends. If I have people to play with its awesome experience. If solo its sorta dull after my 3rd character. All my levels are 54/121/89. I'm at the point to where it's strictly a grind for legendaries.
---
As for what you said I guess we just got to accept their salt. People paid the money of various amounts and experienced what they did. At the end of the day I'm sorta bummed with all  the negativity since I feel it definitely discourages further development of the title. Though if people keep blowing atom and purchasing it then this game will live forever. 
---
Hey I like NMS and I like this, and I also liked that last incarnation of Mass Effects, I might just be odd... optimistic or just have a good enough imagination to fill in the holes.  So let the ignorant hate, and then pray to RNGesus for their sins...   
---
And as far as free Fornite is a money pit of Fashion Barbie online.  My 12 year old son last year got like $400 USD in play station gift cards,  he  turned almost all of that in to skins.
---
I have nothing against them being one of the hardest enemies, it’s just the fact they are completely random, so they’re attacking you without you being able to avoid them. Also, the speed at which they cripple your legs and the fact they seem to be able to spawn anywhere and out of nowhere and follow you for a long distance. I’d have no problem if they started on the ground, and you got a notification on your pip-boy saying “a scorch beast has been spotted in the area” or something. But having 3 appear out of nowhere when I’m hacking a terminal is not a challenge, it’s just frustrating.
---
Wait for the game to be on par with other AAA titles to bother wasting my time with it
---
Thanks for adding that!
---
On PS4 I crash about 10% of the time I move a legendary weapon to or from my stash. I haven't moved non-legendary weapons in a very long time.
---
Whitesprings caters to the illuminati type rich people, not the deviant type
---
I have my super awesome Blackbird paint...only to lose sight of it.
---
Their pretty tough to find because other plays can pick them up as well. Also, just in case you’re not aware, bobbleheads only give temporary boosts in 76. If you want permanent boosts, hunt down magazines.
---
I was wondering if the loot was region-specific. I've only really run down the locations for the stack of maps i had for the Forest areas, and it's been normal stuff that i would get and scrap from workshop claims and events there.
---
The problem with Batman is that the super villains always break out and cause more problems. Just kill them, block them and leave the server.
---
My main issue is that most of the "PvPers" I run into are more along the lines of griefers. They want to engage in PvP I can respect that, by that same token they need to respect that there are people that don't want to.
---
The most common time I see it is when I take a workshop. Some asshole roles up and attacks, one of us dies and then they keep attacking. If its obvious to me that they have no interest in the workshop is make it clear to them I'm not interested and if they don't take the hint I report to Xbox, block, and change servers.
---
It is a little annoying having to clear and set up again but the xp is ok. Similarly I had some idiot and his friends try and force myself and my friend  into either handing over our workshop or (more likely) trying to make us PvP. I'm nor sure which but he stuck around for an HOUR doing literally nothing after the first couple times we killed him and his buddy.
---
If you want a specific workshop that badly just server hop it'll save you a lot of time and energy.
---
Shit.
---
Well... lesson learned.  Thanks for letting me know.  :)
---
We have to use single staircases as camps were/are broke, I don't think people did it by choice. Someone today was on the [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) forums claiming the single staircase is an exploit and needs to be fixed lol
---
Same same. Won't make that mistake twice that's for sure.
---
I feel like the easiest fix would just make a water pump that pumps dirty water. It doesn't need anything special... It's basically just a pump and hose. Just make it something cheap you slap near the river and gathering from it give you 5-10 dirty water at a time. 
---
They are the same people!
---
You are right.  It's kind of a pain in the ass on console (XB1 here).
---
Throughout the week, more and more letters of the key will be revealed.  It's solved early by entering in what is known and guessing the rest and trying it on the keypad afaik
---
Until you run into your 70th nigger knocker, your 100th dickballscockgun, or lastly your 50th pussypistol.
---
I miss renaming things too but humans can't handle nice things in multiplayer games.
---
It's also worth pointing out... carry weight is awesome, but optimized servos lower sprint AP cost.
---
Wanna know what else is tied to sprinting AP costs? Jetpacks :)
---
Shoot the grenade!
---
There's some screenshots from the interior of the vaults.
---
Definitely going ti be raid locations.

It seems even having the perks shared wouldn't allow me to place my camp. Spent a couple hours rebuilding. Thanks to all who reached out!

My artillery cannon is in range, commencing artillery barrage.
---
Yup. I just took the Poseidon Power Plant, and while that was farming I took the ammo factory, then the gorge junkyard and the yard below Poseidon. While all that was running I completed a few quests and forgot. Then T-6 mins and I went and tried to get all the shot from the places. The damn loading times of fast traveling sometimes...
---
It's not supposed to match the armor, just the wetsuit.  The matching helmet for the armor itself is in the game but doesn't seem to be accessible yet for whatever reason.
---
You'll get there.  
---
The rad damage I took while outside in it was &lt;1 every 2 seconds. So they aren't as strong as they used to be. This was with \~100ish rad resist from gear.
---
Like what?
---
Nope! No issue at all. You just die totally fun and no downside 
---
Can we get "line up doors to door frames" added?
---
I'm not being cynical, I'm judging the people acting high and mighty for taking inconsequential stuff and bringing it to social media for the good boy points. Doesn't do much justice  or punishment wise. A lot of these posts mention keeping a thing or two. It's a dumb trend that front pages here too often. Doesn't seem like the healthiest way to respond to the issue, on a community level.
---
Care to explain? Don't they have a short rage of agro?
---
It’s too late for big changes with 76.  They’ll bolt content on and fix a few major exploits (slowly) and that’s it.
---
This is like talking about a massive remodel and expansion for a house that is falling apart, built on a swamp, has three past-due mortgages, and the owner has a maxed out credit card.
---
The real opportunity is the next gen games.  When smooth 4k performance is table stakes and everyone else has raised the bar again.
---
Todd and BGS’s MO has been to squeeze as much as possible with the smallest team possible out of that old engine.   They are focused on world creation and their org structure is likely entirely lacking groups you’d have at “real” AAA studios.
---
We all know they were planning to do it again with their upcoming games.  Hopefully this has been a wake up call and they will actually make the massive 3+ year investment to reset and create the platform for their next 12 years of games.  I’m not sure they have the vision or leadership for this, as chasing the cheapest dollar is all they’ve ever known.  
---
But there’s hope.  Don’t expect anything major in 76 but rather look to ES6 and maybe Starfield.  We’ll learn then if they have a mission that puts players first and the guts to invest and execute.  If it all comes out in the old engine with loot boxes, then we’ll know for sure. :(
---
&gt; sneak, hide
---
Except they are coded to eventually always find you no matter what.
---
It’s really not that hard making legendary items. I could open up the Creation kit for FO4 and whip up a legendary item in 10 minutes. 
---
I have the same issue, managed to do it one and picked it up one other time.  I haven't been able to trigger it again though and its really frustrating.
---
I remember always stripping the cores just to make sure one of those bastards didn’t help themselves.
---
Bahahaha this is brilliant
---
Yeah thats been my issue as welk. Doing it with friends easily helps. But its the reason i made the message. Id like to see more set up for it. 
---
Nah, their is a website where they crack the codes,  you dont even have to gather them by Wednesday the codes are online and you can just get a keycard and go launch a juke with the proper code.
---
I just don't get why the frame can't display the armor pieces on it in your inventory just like a weapon displays its mods. 
---
Sorry, but I have to say it.
---
It looks like you and your wife let out a huge heart shaped fart. 
---
Don't tell'm

they are legit scary..even non-glowing ones

This is awesome! Really! Cute And everything :)

If your gonna drop you need to drop a test item first to make sure you valuables don't get yote into the great beyond

What platform you play on and what's your name you fucking cunt 
---
Exactly! That’s what I’m saying
---
It should be Dupe-Shot Explosive.
---
Lead is actually not very rare and if you set it up so it detects objects with lead you would see how much you can actually find.  
---
In 30 minutes I can farm a count of 200 for lead

That sounds like something a synth would say.

Sugar and Sugar Bombs AP regen effects stack, as do "clean" Sugar Bombs and the radiated ones. I keep some of both for when I need to sprint a long distance.

COME FIND ME NIGGA ILL BE WAITING YOU PUNK BITCH

For me the issue is EVEN if they did add a hunting rifle, the current state of the pipe bolt action would put damage it 100% of the time if they had the same legendary effects. Reason being is pipe bolt action would gain an extra 60% damage with gunslinger on top of the riflemen, demo expert, and bloody mess people usually run. That said, I’m not sure if tank killer works on the pipe bolt action because there’s no way to actually see what your armor pen is 
---
Not if you go into an actual building
---
Magazines don’t give permanent boosts.

Somebody has a lot of golf outfits. Must be a duper.

Did this with my current Camp and it works well for that location. My Last Camp i couldnt get it to use a good location but moving it did change my spawn location.
---
Again laziness. 
---
I use more than 200 an hour oof
---
See, the draw of these player cosmetics is a chance to stand out among your comrades. If they bring back LTO things, especially things only those of us playing early after release might have now, the playerbase that got it then will feel betrayed.
---
Just wait for another blacked-out PA skin to come out, there will certainly be another.
---
1. Combat: Vats shouldnt target friendlies period.
---
I have never had problems with corpse looting personally and making them disapear after emptying would be unrealistic.
---
2. C.A.M.P could there be room for other items to decorate shelves/ tables not just limited to weapons for that personal touch.
---
5. Clothing: option to have armour visible over clothes like greaser jacket and jeans for example would be most welcome. Obviously much time by the devs has gone into making armour peices look good too so I would like to see more players wearing them.
---
All other improvements listed are sensible and I look forward to seeing at least some of them implemented.
---
42069420
---
Not even joking 
---
I try to but half the time my trade requests are rejected or ignored. 
---
I end up leaving the items in the cash register at my nearest vendor.
---
Acting high and mighty? Lol more like you're reading into this in the way you want to. Nothing but a little bit of trolly fun going on. But go ahead and continue your psycho analzying of the sub, that's helping just as much as anything else. 
---
Bring it on bitch post your name fool
---
Same with soups and juices needing Boiled Water, not Purified Water.
---
I've yet to encounter this weapon, does this count as a heavy weapon, or assault rifle? I usually love LMGs and I'm a heavy in my game so I'm hoping heavy.
---
someone should start a synth group
---
i think an issue with that is people naming weapons after legendary effects to trick people
---
I have for Charlie : B2 X6 O6 N2 H0 for the moment
---
Sounds like a plus to me, time to start messing with other players lol
---
Dang should have planned for reset.. at Charlie launch with incorrect code heh heh.. throw Charlie my way if it gets cracked soon pls
---
There's lead deposits all over the map.  Lucky hole mine has a bunch of them.  Equip excavator and you'll be out of there with 100+ ore (~400 lead once refined).  I've been running out of steel before anything lately.
---
Shit jetpack is 1%!? I was really lucky
---
(if anyone's curious I don't really like it that much. The stagger when you land is a buzz kill)

Aegonie
---
Ranged weapons still need to be buffed up.
---
They are literally useless unless u have a legendary TSE Version. This counts for all ranged weapons, rifles ans heavy guns as well
---
Also we still need more stash space.
---
600 was a improvement but still not enough.
---
A 1000 space would be fine. 
---
&gt; But absolutely yes to adding more songs, or a new radio station, even if it's with a robot DJ. Hell, it would make for a great quest line too. You have to clear out and set up an old radio station. You could have them announce major events happening in your area when they start. Maybe you could even have a reoccurring quest where you go somewhere to find holotapes with new music.
---
It'd be nice if Rose's radio station played music instead of her just talking constantly. 
---
Well yes obviously as do most of us especially with bigger guns.  
---
My point was that lead isn't that rare and if you put in the time to actually wander the map you can get a lot.
---
I'd bet money that all those nuked camps were ones bunched around whitesprings.  And also that anyone who's played the game knows that any person willing to spend the time to hunt a cargobot, clear a silo and launch a nuke just to annoy one other person who's just going to server hop away before it lands is only griefing themselves.
---
Wait till you find a “stalking Mothman” :s those eyes...
---
I got mine turning in Technical Data.
---
Somebody just killed me with an explosive weapon. Filthy duper.
---
Did you already get to the end of the silo? 
---
I would like to piggy back of your comment and say that I wish the NukaGirl suit gave you protection from diseases
---
Hm, ok. I was only thinking it didn't because I was choking before after acquiring it (and I always wear it after I got it). Though that might be because sometimes when I get out of power armor it fails to reequip things.
---
Does fast traveling work underwater? Or get out of the armor, recall it, and swim. 
---
Just fast travel.
---
No they aren't. You can absolutely hide from them; they have a patrol pattern they follow, and a stupidly high PER stat (or something to that effect).
---
But you can definitely break line of sight and hide; sometimes they break off quickly, while other times they do linger around and keep attacking.
---
I'm not saying they aren't a complete bastard of a mob, but they aren't some hard-coded murderbots that can't be evaded.
---
yeah I guess you got a point there.  
---
Oh you play on Xbox you a pussy boi anyways
---
That journalism is yellower than a snallygaster's teeth.
---
"We don't know why (specifically) we have stash limitations."
---
"...we plan to increase the storage cap further in the future once we’ve verified this change does not impact the stability of the game."
---
They have flat out said the storage limitation is a stability issue, you wanted proof and I gave it to you. 
---
If storage is a stability issue how the hell does a player carrying around tons of unique items not cause the same thing? 
---
Usually when I drop items I'll drop 1 piece of ammo first, if it's there, I just transfer the contents into the bag directly. Only problem I've had is when my brother instantly took the ammo as I was transferring a beer hat to him and the beer hat disappeared forever, so make sure that it's all done before you drop it, and do it in a safe place like your own camp.
---
Yep.
---
I find something I can interact with and put things in it for friends. Toolboxes, lunchboxes or anything else I can hit X and transfer.

https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
The dude who runs Nukacrypt is online rn trying to figure them out, and has people that help him do it as well (as well as inform him when codes are discovered by others)
---
Where’s the screenshots? I can’t find them
---
Servers back on?
---
Thx man :)
---
They even have a level 48 perk called Friendly Fire that makes flamethrower-type weapons heal teammates when used on them.
---
I don’t think there is because bobble heads are consumable in 76
---
No, there isn't. You can't display anything in this game, meaning all shelves in your house are empty, etc.
---
Oh that sucks.
---
Nigga you couldn't fuck my mom with a bullshit name like dilly dally - you broke-ass and limp dick Xbox player
---
It's been said before, but Bethesda has no way to view/modify player inventories. The reason why is probably based on the online infrastructure being added to an existing engine and the database being a mess with no parser, but it's come up several times in regards to glitched inventories, and that they can't is straight from Bethesda's mouth.
---
Hey, hey, hey, what about jumping while vatsing! Nope, better dump out or that hoard of ghouls is gonna stampede your ass over. OMG so many deaths!
---
That’s why...I’m just level 21 I think

‘Lost tapes’ was my fucking show man

I’ll go find that! Thanks

Less weight. Not worth it at all though.
---
And got Marine Shielded plans from "Census Violence" on the next day.
---
.....
---
Ive been griefing myself with the spite nukes all along.
---
Still fun to do though, and a great source of lead and steel.
---
Great tips. With the acid though: if you bulk it and scrap it you’ll gain acid. The bulk takes 10 and scraps into 15 🤗
---
You kinda are on.. The side of the map that they are common on. You don't really see them much on the west side, but the closer you get to cranberry bog the more you're asking for trouble. It sucks when you have a quest objective in the area and cant get to it, I get it. I've had to hold off on some quests because of that, or just hope I get lucky. 
---
You can not craft a lining for the wetsuit, not the wetsuit itself. That's a different plan.
---
You are correct about shared inventory. The vendor has 3 mods when reset/fresh. If you server hop and there are less than 3, then someone already bought some.
---
Oh tin cans have steel too
---
Yeah I can see why you like it! Thanks!
---
Same.  Tried to use my Toxic Valley Treasure Map 3  yesterday.  Did not work.  No option to dig.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Last time you got pussy was when you came out the womb and saw the light, and that's the last good damn time you'll see, smell, or touch a pussy other than your own or the one on your console

Cotton Candy Bites are my backup supply but I typically hover around  30 Canned Coffee with the Can Do perk and with my 14-17 Luck it seems up come up fairly often for me.
---
... of course now that I said that I'm sure it'll get nerfed,  lol 
---
On Xbox
---
Dont know how many others have noticed but whenever you pick up a hard hat ( no matter what color) they turn off greenish/blue as soon as they get to your inventory.-
---
I see that the headlamp bug from fallout 4 has carried over. Really immersive seeing a flashlight come out of my foot.-
---
Scorchbeasts still sometimes lock up the fps.-
---
Why is it that feral ghouls have the stamina of usein bolt? Even with speed demon and sprinting away your full ap bar, as soon as you stop sprinting they're right there 4 inches behind you.-
---
Whenever youre running and something melees you your chartacter just stops moving entirely for like 3 seconds (this can become very frustrating)-
---
I thought the same thing. 
---
It is too powerful and easy to get . Numbers wise, there is no reason to use regular armor over PA.
---
If we all know that then Beth does too so think PA will remain in its current state forever is silly. 
---
I don't think so.
---
You can't scrap them directly from "Stored"?  
---
I gave up on turrets to build an attached garage and hang some pictures.
---
So I need the wet suit plan? 
---
Yea, my biggest "if only id known".
---
I made a post, requesting the Unique Items at max rank from players with playstyles that dont fit said items, and i actually wound up with Perfect Storm lvl 50. I thought for sure that would be one of the harder ones to acquire so high, and to find someone willing to part on top of it... Got pretty lucky. Am happy. Now just need the rest haha
---
9 of your str points are pure damage. You’ve got 6 left over for other things, which usually means carry weight since most of them are in the str tree. I do heavy guns AND explosives so I’m running ordinance express and bear arms 
---
I didn't like the idea of BoS and super mutants being around before the other Fallout games, but the way they tied them into the lore worked well.
---
I love this post. Let me tell you a story that happened to me.
---
I’m a small time twitch streamer. I decide I was going to do giveaways on Christmas. So me and my grind the game super hardcore. We farmed White Springs Nukes And farmed Legendaries sold them to other players etc.
---
We farmed Harper Fairy hardcore for Caps. Cause Super Mutants are type of enemy that tend to have caps. Always did before the nerf. We cap Limit like 30 times a piece building up Guns for a my Christmas Twitch stream.
---
I had to create alts to hold caps and guns as I was building my guns for the Christmas stream give away.
---
I started buying off a market here on reddit. I bought from multiple people. One person I bought guns off serval Times. On our 3rd Business dealings he asked why was I buying all these guns. I told him why. He said okay I will let you know if I run into any more. He added me as a friend.
---
So on Christmas Eve the person who asked why I was buying so many guns and added as a friend messaged me. He then invited me to a Xbox Live Party on Christmas Eve.
---
He then invited to his game. I joined his game and team. Fast traveled to him. He then proceed to put stuff in a bag. He told me to get contents in the bag. He after I retrieved everything in the bag. I looked at my Inventory and he had given me 10,000 pounds of guns ammo and Stimpacks.
---
I then knew he was a duper. He didn’t dupe them there with me. Because he never left the game. At the time didn’t even know the Mechanics Of duping. I looked up on the dupe after I was accused and called scum for giving away guns.
---
So I went ahead Streamer for about 6 hours on Christmas giving away guns ammo and Stimpacks.
---
Even after all the guns I gave away I still had 5,000 pounds of guns on me.
---
I then proceed to do giveaways on reddit. I then began to sell some of the guns and start giving caps to new players and a gun sometimes. Even after 3 more days of giving and selling I still had 3,900 pound of guns on me.
---
I posted on another sub reddit selling them. I was banned and accused of being a duper. After long talks and DMs and me proving and giving Video evidence I wasn’t a duper they agreed to make it a temporary ban.
---
I still couldn’t give and sell the guns fast enough. So one day I walked to a unpopular part of the map with no body around and dropped all the guns in a bag in the middle of now where and proceed to log out and stayed logged out for 24 hours making sure the guns where deleted.
---
Now I now have the stigma of being a duper. When I have never actually duped anything. So everybody buys off reddit you have probably bought a duped item,so I guess your a duper also.
---
That’s why I enjoyed your post so much!
---
Hey man, if it's fun for you then nuke the hell out of them!
---
If it’s not labeled for a specific PA then it’s for the Excavator Armor. This can also be verified by the mod being able to be scrapped for Black Titanium.
---
i have 2  but i dont trade them  too valuable plus the only way to trade it is to drop it and i wouldnt only do that for a super trusted person
---
It's fine. 
---
You can display stuff from the atomic shop, like the succulents or power armor statue. 
---
That's just sad, load of empty shelves gathering dust. Shame we can't personalised our CAMP's
---
I have found that if you move while sneaking yes they will but if you have chosen your hiding place well you can slowly work your way around. Running is a fool's bet they have no aggro reset (insert joke here) or aggro range limit. The only thing that can get them off you in terms of aggro is diverting their aggro to another entity. Entering a building can sometimes get rid of them but sometimes not. Basically rank 1 of sneak is not enough rank 2 I have no idea but rank 3 Will let you avoid them long enough to escape. Thick underbrush or forests will help you stay hidden. open ground Will make you detected.
---
Yes. Or just to get your hands on a wetsuit. If you're on ps4 I can make you one if you have the materials.
---
Yea
---
Right, it would have to be restricted to the tracks already in the game for radio stations. Maybe they could add more in the future too.
---
How Bethesda chooses to respond to this list will make or break this game in 2019. Choosing to continue to ignore our requests is going to drive away the already waning player base.
---
I really hope they pay closer attention to what the players want, and focus on maintaining retention of the current playerbase and trying to bring back those that have left with some future content. Or else this game is in very bad shape.
---
Thanks for sharing. Nukacrypt team is actively working on it though.
---
There is little we can do without any of the keyword available (the 3 boards in the command center). 
---
I never knew you could remove dud words. I've never had a problem looking at the likenesses score and figuring it out.
---
Lower weight on weapons you're probably not going to use to shoot down a cargo bot with anyway. Also certain combinations of legendary mods (tse) can be powerful enough that the damage fall off from range matters a lot less but 4lbs is always a big deal.
---
It seems to be, at least. There are a lot of anecdotal stories like mine above where the message will show up and players will then find others duping. I'm sure there are other reasons it would appear (correlation is not causation, after all), but duping has a good chance of being one of those causes. 
---
I do it solo. Everyone I've had a legendary of some description.  Uranium fever is the best though for 3 guaranteed legendaries.  Also quite regularly a legendary gulper will be around when you fast travel to dyer chemical. Am on Xbox.
---
Tesla Coils do a ticked energy damage to hostile targets within melee range. It’s really useful for tagging enemies in Whitesprings during nuke farms.
---
I was thinking more like pizza. Hairy, cheesy pizza. 
---
If you look at my previous posts, I openly admit that I am. It takes one to know one!
---
We had weekly patches until December 19th. We're half a month at best. 
---
The issue is the game was released early when it needed a year, likely some big wigs who got impatient and the dev team has to live with their decision.  
---
Cause you're gay and your pictures would be gay 
---
wait how do I make a ledge with the railway rifle? can you give some more information on this?  
---
do you shoot ammo that you've dropped? you do drop ammo onto where you shot? do you shoot it twice?
---
my base is on the golf course but i have no turrets and dont use it for cheapness i just like the scenery
---
Does that work for the marine armor, I have the plans for the arms. 
---
He is about to clear alpha. Good for me lol
---
YESSS!
---
How do people solve em without the keyword? Just guess randomly? I'm so lost on that part.
---
Should make it auto toggle you out of passive and into pvp when taking a workshop. That would fix most of the issues. That way people could not use passive as a advantage when taking a workshop.
---
You trigger a "PvP" event it auto sets you to PvP and adds a timer before you can passive again.
---
It’s all RNG so... Are you on Xbox by chance? I’d be willing to pay you caps to install the mod on my torso.
---
Were you able to dupe kidneys?
---
All you have to do is sit in a decontaminating shower. No rads gained
---
Let me poke around on here.
---
It was under that post about glitching into vault 96 the other day.
---
Got all pieces for all silo
---
Oh yeah, that's the other core mechanic, queueing health regeneration while vats...
---
Nope, it's under armor. Like the vault suit or road leathers.
---
I believe you need to attach a switch or pressure plate to the interior side of the door
---
Yeah that seems like a bit of a weird thing. Like what is the keypad for? Does the lever actually let people pull it? Or just you because you own it?
---
Not sure why people are downvoting this.  Thanks for the info, i'll have to give it a shot!
---
Huh?
---
So, two things:
---
1. You can usually hear their wings flapping long before they're on you; once you hear that sound, you need to drop what you're doing and GTFO.
---
2. You're in Camp Venture as a lowbie? No offense, but... you're asking for it. I wandered into the Mire as a lowbie, and that was some "walking on eggshells" gaming. I think you need to accept that playing in that area means a lot of fleeing. If you saw a Scorch Beast in the Forest, it'd likely be green, and not attacking you.
---
It just feels like they’re trying to artificially stretch out the gameplay by making quests jump in difficulty randomly, like a quest starts in a level 10 area and ends in a level 60 area, instead of having more quests for newer players/in all areas, nobody likes the daily quest bs. I wish they put a recommended level/difficulty ratings by each quest in your pip-boy.
---
Tried a switch but it didn’t do anything
---
speed hack no longer works. no such thing as a trade glitch, it's never even been real. i hardly ever have disconnects, maybe a few a week. and the damage bug has been fixed
---
Thank you. that brings some comfort knowing its been addressed already.
---
thank you again
---
I agree that it is to easy to get, but I don’t think the numbers should be toned down. 
---
However I think that regular armor needs a buff. I don’t think regular armor should have the raw resist that PA does but it needs a serious boost. 
---
The main advantage of using regular armor is the ability to get legendary affects, depending on build they can be way more powerful than the extra raw damage resist from PA
---
In one alternate reality, a Scorchbeast descended on Charleston Fire Department. An unlucky vault dweller had just fast traveled and heard the ominous sound of flapping above and behind. A sudden screech split the air. It was then that out vault dweller know that the situation was going from bad to worse. He was on the road a bit behind the fire station, and without looking back or above, he ran for cover, and for his life.
---
The only building in sight was Charleston Fire Department. The welcome clankity clank of Firebreather Protectrons did very little to ease the wanderer's fear as he ran inside and hid in a corner. The screeching continued and green fog started to pour in through the roof of the fire department. As the lone wanderer took cover, scorched started to pour in through the large open doors at the front of the station. He took one down, than another... but it was no use as the attack continued and the foundations of the building started to shake.
---
The Firebreather Protectrons put up a valiant fight, but many were quickly destroyed by the beast hovering above while others were overrun by scorched. One or two even wandered aimlessly around the inside of the station minus it's torso and head. However, soon enough, the robotic resistance was destroyed, the Protectrons reduced to nuts and bolts by screeching madness. Charleston Fire Department had been over run  and completely destroyed.
---
As for the lone wanderer, escape wasn't an option,. Hoping to another server was the only way out....
---
That's all good, I'm talking about the people that put there base right at the back door of the golf house where people farm. 
---
OK,  thanks I'll try to scavenge a wet suit. 
---
The issue with the buildings outside of the golf club house is that even when the owner of the building isn't there its killing ghouls. If you turrets kills the ghouls but you havent actually caused any damage to the ghouls personally you get no XP or loot from it so it is pointless. So when turrets are just killing groups of ghouls and nobody is there to assist in killing them (it does work well where there are people there and turrets) then it is just killing them for no reason and you end up just waiting for more ghouls to respawn. If you arent there when they respawn they end up getting killed again and then you have to wait even longer.
---
I had a camp at white springs with turrets but it was furthur away from the golf building so you could lead a pack of ghouls back there but it didn't shoot them from a distance. The turrets was under the house and it had a funnel kind of entrance to lead packs down there.
---
I do wish they restricted the build area around the golf club area a bit more, there are plenty of other places to build around white springs without it affecting other players.
---
I’m on that quest but didn’t collect any yet. Are we supposed to have the same letters? So I assume the same as yours?
---
Also would like to know what to do with them. Do we arrange them to make a word?
---
And M5, K6 G3
---
It's the event in Watoga. There is a farming technique down there where u don't complete the quest and it keeps recycling. Can't remember exactly but u spend most of the time on top of the lion in the foyer.
---
You are welcome
---
Well they are trying combos right now. Once they get one right we can get them all
---
tin cans, aluminum cans, wood letter blocks, baby rattles, rat poison, pencils, combination wrenches, all contain lead 
---
I think mutation serums are affected by stimpacks Weight reduction, Chem duration boost (from perk and chest mod).
---
Atleast they lasted Two hours when i used mine.
---
I can wait lol
---
Clients (the players) should not be able to DoS servers so easily.  It's a two-way street.
---
Im curious bout that aswell yhis first time i tried doing it legit
---
No. 
---
Server hopping refreshes it for me.
---
It's weird after placement the atom icon shows but if it's a little later sometimes the icons gone 
---
Shit yea just realize the codes weren’t solved 
---
Thanks for doing this but really it should be put in a system like UserVoice. Still happy to work with someone from the community to put it all together.
---
This or ducking in and out of a nuke zone will eventually make the rads/s glitch out and you can walk around free from radiation.
---
Also always aim your fissure prime nukes so drop site 9 is rad free, the queen will fly out of the nuke zone and you can do the whole fight rad free.
---
Maybe I'm a noob on this, but does it benefit you in any way? my understanding is the player has the tag the ghoul to get the xp and any loot. If turrets deal 100% of damage, no player, including the turret owner, gets xp or loot. I personally never see the human player there, but the turrets end up drawing the aggro from 2/3 of the ghouls I'm kiting.
---
Very well put, thanks for the contribution. I agree I wish it was a bit more restrictive in that area. 
---
You can find the codes on discords so you don't need to do it yourself. 
---
When you hover over the power armour chassis, a little preview shows up showing it. The armour should be applied to that so that we know what pieces of armour it has on it
---
No I don't mean the Whitesprings bunker area but the lower level area where all the crafting benches &amp; vendors are now. I guess maybe it's more a basement area? If they cleared out a room for player vending machines I would hope the area would be a free fast travel area with the vendor spawn point inside the building safe from the nukes.
---
I'd like to see the vendors at individual camps though. It would be interesting to get to see all the players builds and how they decorate and stuff. I rarely stumble across camps now. And it would feel more personal. Chem vendors could decorate in a pharmacy way, things like that. It's going to be interesting to see what they come up with.
---
I just got a furious faster swing speed grog axe for the tougher enemies. It doesn't do that sexy double damage on the first hit but if I know it's not gonna go down in 1 swing, i.e. the things you mentioned, the constant increase of damage per swing far exceeds that instigating damage. I keep my 3* instigating hammer for everyday mobs and for nuked whitesprings lol
---
So is this a popular thing to do on this reddit? If so I need to start one to empty out my stash.
---
I tried that, but my artillery didn't do any damage to their base. I wonder why? I'd love to punish those kill-stealing jerks.
---
Pizza the Hutt. Seriously.
---
I’d also add under combat a more intuitive VATS system where you can use stimpaks and bash or throw grenades as well.
---
So whats the point of the pieces?
---
I've done Patrol Duty probably 50 times so I know it sucks. I still think it's your best bet or make an alt and buy it at level 15. PS got over 10 plans in those 50 runs so good luck if you keep trying!
---
Just an fyi, but Covert Operative (agility) exists for ranged weapons.
---
The dots are remaining tries, and only change when you try an answer, or get the 'tries reset' message.  When it says 'dud removed' there will be a word on the board that is wrong, and is taken out of play. For Example:
---
* Spring
---
* Forage
---
* Bullet
---
* ($%)
---
you click on Spring, it says 1 correct, and the dots go from 4 to 3. You click on ($%) and get a 'dud removed', the dots stay at 3, but now your list looks like this: 
---
* ......
---
The 'dud' being Bullet.
---
I’m level 26, just trying to do the quest I have, but idk what level I need to be for the quest until I get slaughtered by an enemy or chased from Harpers Ferry the whole way back to my camp (near Gauley Mine)by a level 64 Super Mutant.
---
I'm going to have to disagree with you on using production as a test environment. The servers only support 24 players, it's not hard to create beta test servers. I bet you could run a beta test server for $400 a month and use three shifts of 24 players to do testing. Just coordinate your times zones and have people around the world do The testing. 
---
This isn't an MMO, It's small servers attached to a large database. Even if it was an MMO those tend to have test environments.
---
i remember getting to lvl 40 on my ps3 and having to restart the game every 15 minutes. 
---
Nerfed? Ofcourse not. You could just move those luck points into strength and drop the 10 lvl20 1star legendary pipe pistols, for a start
---
I had that happen to. I still don't know wtf caused it lol 
---
Pro tip: don't call people bitches on the internet and expect to get a positive response.
---
The node just to the east of that one is also really cool, although it gets attacked more often. The one by the asylum isn't attacked very often at all, even though the scorchbeast comes to the asylum any time someone does the event, and occasionally multiple scorchbeasts get pretty close to it from the south, I've never had a scorchbeast attack my camp in all the time i've camped there.
---
Nice I’ve always been a fan of small and tall bases. 
---
You’d think that buffing the underperforming factor would be the first thing that MMO devs would do. But in my experience of MMOs , it almost never s that way. Simply buffing creates power creep which then leads to more issues they have to fix. 
---
Nerfing can create problems too, but it’s easier to fine tune after a nerf than fine tune after a buff. 
---
As far as I know, best place to find firecaps is in the area around Gauley Mine.
---
It give no benefit to the turret's owner. I'm thinking they use the turrets to help them farm the club house when they first log in. 
---
I disagree, I believe that Bethesda has every ability to follow through with every change I suggested. They say they've developed Fallout 76 as a live service with evolving content and long term support, and the only way to salvage that is going to be to fix Fallout 76 itself. 
---
Are they more likely to abandon it or be far too slow and unresponsive to get things fixed? Yeah, unfortunately they are. But I've watched this industry for decades now, and I've seen what does and doesn't work when it comes to rehabbing a game's reputation after a bad launch period, and I feel pretty confident that this would do it.
---
I think it's safe to say that the opinion gamers have long held toward Bethesda isn't one of "trust" but more "understanding" where we accept the flaws we get, and understand that Games Are Hard while being willing to sacrifice in the name of knowing we have mods to save us down the road. But with 76, I think Bethesda has started losing that understanding and it's going to finally start hurting future products. Either that, or gamers will prove that on the whole we're like a case of domestic abuse that keeps coming back no matter how many times the cops get called to deal with the screaming.
---
It seems to rain regularly in the forest but I've only seen one rad storm from beta till now.
---
This is such a good tip. Another good one is you can feed wire through windows then replace the wall with something solid to clip wires through walls. 
---
yeah I wish if you had a silenced gun then scrapping it gave you a \*chance\* to learn the silenced perk for that weapon (or any of the others you haven't learned). Weird to scrap a plain gun and learn some perk that gun didn't have....
---
That is definitely one of the underrated aspects of the game- awesome creatures. Aside from SB being annoying of course. 
---
Scorchbeasts are also back! just heard 1 fly by.
---
How does that even works with heard mentality and plague Walker.
---
I use a level 30 (character level 32) suppressed pipe revolver maxxed damage mods etc, head shots in stealth can take down a level 60 sm prime in four shots from a safe distance, 2 if I get up close and personal - do this at your own risk as he often has buddies nearby.
---
Put in pacifier mode 
---
I mostly use a pointed stick, well now it is a bladed stick, but vats has proven highly unuseful to me.  I think the last time it targeted one of my gun turrets
---
Ill keep that in mind. Do you know if the Fire Res perk work with Explosives?
---
I think that’s a carry over from prelaunch speculation. I think someone discussing plans for the game said players *could*, which led people to *players do*.
---
Tested it unfriended a few players and also went solo.  Those players were able to pull the lever without having troubles he code and my door opened.
---
Do different power armors have different abilities?
---
Thanks man. This is the exact imput I was looking for. 
---
I had one chasing me down pre-patch earlier today near Tanagra Town.
---
Guys are impatient af
---
This is a great question. Unfortunately I don't have an answer. 
---
However, I'd like to piggy-back on your question and ask if Lifesaving Armor pieces proc Revenant also?
---
Got it - do agree many of your points are achievable.  I was projecting my own desires for big changes which I do believe are implausible for BGS to pull off in 76
---
I had this happen before the hotfix too. No idea what causes it. Sometimes it goes away by itself.
---
It's a pain in the ass, but I kinda like it because it gives me the satisfaction of survival. Having to overcome the odds. Later on you end up being able to stand there while the SBQ shoots you in the face and you're just like meh
---
oh, my wooden house does not like them.
---
I have had to install a mod for the slay bells skin because I don’t think Bethesda are going to fix it. Mod was easy enough to install and it works. Good luck though 
---
it happened to be yesterday
---
The song removal wasn’t really necessary, it’s all personally taste at that point.
---
I've always had them, but maybe the full auto "screech" attach! I will add this to the list
---
that should last about 15 minutes.
---
I have found 3 excavator shocks at Camden park at different times. I heard Welch is also a good place to try, but no luck there for me. 
---
Keypad is on wrong side of door 
---
What does TSE stand for? I know you mean my gun but the Acronym &gt;.&lt;
---
Is it the one that’s open, with the BoS jumpsuit underneath? I’ve had that one, and the rest of the outfit ruins the look. 
---
I still don't understand it though. I've seen 3 missile turrets, which make short work of the ghouls. There's no time to even tag them all :(
---
But how hard would you nerf it? It wouldn’t take much before PA would be pointless other than for heavy gun builds 
---
Hmm, would be kinda nice if we could get unarmed override mods for power armor.  Arm mounted drills, lasers, ect.  Could use the fusion core for "ammo"
---
Egh no worries, haters gonna hate. I posted for people like you not them. As someome with 350+ hours in the game i found it really fun a d hope they add further improvements.
---
I agree the hardest part is getting it off the ground.
---
Two shot prefix and multi shot mods reduce durability far more than single shot variants.
---
Those Sonsaabitches never left
---
Also if they disappear, sometimes if you step back and drop another item they will all appear in the 2nd bag
---
Did you factor in head shots? 120hp for a lot of people is not nothing. 
---
It might be half their health total as well for a lot of people.
---
Did you factor in armor/non-armour? There's no mention of how DR affects results.
---
Killed one yesterday with All Rise.
---
Good point. I'd like to minimize attacks. I don't mind repairing walls and generators but I keep crops for adhesive, which are annoying to keep fixing. 
---
Welcome to FU RADIO where we just say curse words in a squeeky voice 24 hours a day.
---
Your wrong,
---
It had a lot of bad press earlier on. People judging the game based on that
---
Doesn’t matter tried both ways, you could access the house but couldn’t get out
---
Never considered doing it for obvious reasons, so I never brainstormed the management. I don't plan on smashing a hotkey anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 times for a 5-20% profit margin. More so since caps afe basically worthless at this moment in time.
---
Why? You in the mood for more bugs?
---
You can also run a pipe that can penetrate the walls, ceilings, and floors, if you'd rather not have wiring going through a solid wall.
---
That's why I made this post, it drives me crazy. Trolls will be trolls,  right? I just think it'd be cool if the community got together to punish these people when they come across their camps
---
That's... that's how discussion works. Different viewpoints come in. If you only want conversation with people that agree with you you're going to have a hard life. 
---
damn, i thought the codes would work but deff don’t use the most recent code stated by OP, lost a keycard right there because of that. i’m currently waiting to launch at alpha as well
---
I give away bullets and excess diluted chems, as well as a gas mask to anyone I meet under lvl in16 in the forest
---
I place the connectors on the outside of the wall. Once its connected to the generator, the lights will pop on.
---
For my personal use, which characters of mine can craft it :)
---
Big if true.  Can’t check until after work lol
---
&gt;I'm curious to know who ordered the hit job on Bethesda?
---
People who click on FO76 ragefest articles. As long as those articles keep raking in the ad dollars, people will keep writing them.
---
Itd be great if it was, but it would invalidate the bandolier perk
---
Cranberry bog. I think it has everything.
---
Had to do that in Blackwater mine the other night.
---
Ok, an instigating supersledge sounds super sexy now... I didn't even think about it, thank you! Back to farming I go.
---
Strange. I havent seen em at all the last few days
---
What type of rewards do you get ?
---
Oh I will check it out but it's weird for that to happen to 4 at the same time?
---
You really gave me alot to think on, including un-intentionally being an ass in group zones.
---
Calling it now there is already a new way
---
One monster that is extremely rare is a fog crawler. I've only seen one roaming around in cranberry when a nuke dropped there
---
Well they did ruin the game economy, server stability  and PvP at minimum, so people being wary of/having contempt for them is earned I’d say.  
---
Or after vulgar phrases all though I would find it hilarious some may not
---
The reason I don't think they can afford to wait and run betas is that I think the problems are too great to leave unattended in the amount of time a traditional beta process would take. I honestly think they need to get things out there without delay, even if they break something. 
---
If they do that, they prove that they're at least listening to players and working on the problems instead of letting us all sit here watching and waiting to see if something is ever going to happen. Plus, I think a lot of the changes they need to make will take weeks if not months to show the true depths of the results once it's in the hands of players. 
---
In a lot of fundamental ways, Fallout really 76 is an MMO, it's just one that treats every "shard" like an instance would be treated. And I know it wouldn't be hard to create beta test servers, but I just think it wouldn't be responsive enough or representative enough of the end result.
---
Why does the year mean there won't be bugs and shit, also 76 came out in 2018 and didn't have the game breaking bugs/glitches that alot of games do any more.  I mean, sure there are plenty of bugs/glitches that can cause frustration, but they don't lock you out of accessing content like in some games
---
All my .50 and shotgun rounds still weigh the same
---
What level of bandolier do you have
---
...Because Rockstar made a great game and Bethesda didn't.
---
There's a reason people respect some companies more than others.
---
Gonna log out and in to see if it is a bug. 
---
Where there is reward, there should be risk.
---
What's vague about serendipity?  What am i missing?
---
Make nuke silos operational again? Because it didn’t do that.
---
(GP) weighs nothing - Weights can Weigh something, my 10mm says it weighs .0006 lbs which is close to nothing.
---
'Reflect 50% of damage while blocking' is a major modifier for 2-3\* legendary melee weapons, along with full set of 3\* Assassin's armor (total 40% reduction from players) with the reduce damage while blocking or sentinel's minor modifier (total 75% damage reduced while blocking).   
---
Now, I'm not sure how these effects work, but if making these two assumptions:
---
1. Reflected damage is calculated BEFORE any player damage reduction.
---
2. Damage reduction from multiple sources is additive (not multiplicative)  
---
Then the player could potentially have complete damage immunity from players and reflect damage as long as they blocked.
---
Actually,  it's the 240 lbs (after Traveling Pharmacy 3 and Tru-Hiker 3) of assorted Chems and their various  reagents that is weighing me down mostly.  But thus is the life of a Jet Road Dealer.  Hey,  got wouldn't happen to need anything would you?  A little Fury,  some X-Cell, Bufftats,  Pschotats, you name it,  Lucky Joe's got it.
---
I typically only travel with two rifles and a pistol.  I'm considering stashing my power armor for the extra twenty pounds but that's still only pounds.   You sure got don't need a fix? Anything you ever just wanted to try; just once?
---
We where giving the base average. Because the PVP Mechanics seem to favor help lower levels...
---
Armor was hard to judge because some of the better armor isn’t available to lower levels. So we went with plain simple leather.
---
this is such a no brainer. I have ultracite armor and half a T60 armor along with the regular excavator. I can only use the excavator and I have to take out all three chassis every.single.time. They don't even seem to stay in order in the stash. so when the ex PA was the last PA chassis it becomes the second the next time and so on. It seems to be random or at least I haven't figured it out yet (not that I tried too hard).
---
9mm plz omg
---
that was only 2 minutes... the You tub vid will be out in 12
---
for me they're 0.002, 5mm are 0.001
---
Balance all weapons.
---
Make multi shot mods not increase durability loss.
---
Dear Bathesda, please give me a new emoji, in that allows me the throw dollar bills in the air my nacked toons.
---
Yeah what's that about? Why can they just get away with it by hopping servers, leaving you with the cost of repairing all that stuff?
---
Yeah, had a level 60 something 3 star legendary Deathskull Radscorpion spawn at the top of the world when I was level 14, what a shock that was, invited a random level 80 to my group, he wasn’t expecting it and got sneak attacked by the thing
---
Kinda wish I didn't tame a mireking tbh, I'd love to have a geckoyboi at my camp inste.....omfg THEY SHOULD MAKE TAME GULPERS LOOK LIKE GIANT AXLOTLS SO PLAYERS DON'T SHOOT THEM ON ACCIDENT AND IT'D BE FUGGIN ADORBS
---
That's why I said guess lol
---
But also the 120 dps I do to said player they only receive on average 12 damage to health pool. So they only on average received 10% of my damage.
---
Thats because RDR2 actually has an amazing story and plot, unlike fo76
---
Before game release I was concerned about camps being nuked. Now I know nukes only happen in Whitesprings - or very rarely elsewhere... was actually delighted someone nuked Top of the World the other day so I could run and watch it from near my camp for the photo op.
---
Alright, thanks. Than it's an ingame failure that it's crafted under heavy weapons at the weapons workbench 
---
I wrote this long response about hoarding. Then I remembered it’s a roleplaying game and you can do whatever you damn well please. Godspeed you Nuka lovin’ animal. You do you, boo. 
---
Another thing added in the gigantic laundry list of "how the heck did no one bring this up"
---
For anyone on PC I farmed them and am selling them for 750c. I think this is a fair price as it costs ~500 per plan and 250c for my time hopping and leveling an alt is worth something. I have many copies for anyone who wants them. I usually see them go for 1k+
---
Idk how you have no quests 
---
"if I didn't know..... Why the roses grow...."
---
Honestly I think big changes could be made to Fallout 76 as well, I think they could do everything from mild revamps and adding a few new zones all the way to resetting the map to say, the following year after Vault 76 opened, adding human NPC's, and all sorts of things. That's a strength the company does have, even while they've got some pretty well established weaknesses. I'd love to see the game truly evolve and push forward for years, I'm just afraid at this point that we're going to wind up with an essentially stillborn experience because they're going to lose players too quickly. 
---
The best we can hope for if they don't follow at least some of the suggestions I outlined is that we get private servers and can seize control over the Fallout 76 experience from start to finish as a community. Once that happens, we can fix a whole lot of other issues.
---
I just started a new character that I wanted to be a luck based sniper Etc. Do you have a recommended special distribution?
---
Yeah and if you can, show us a screenshot? 
---
- make sure your not in a party, even alone.
---
- check your game settings, you may have disabled it on accident
---
good shout :) but i thought when someone takes them, theyre gone for everyone?
---
They changed that when the gold store opened.
---
I did. It was my T-51b Nuka Cola, Jetpack, Shocks and HUD set. 
---
Spent a while trying to find ways to place it and ended up risking dropping it. 
---
Dropped the chassis whilst wearing my excavator set, and it made an exact clone of the set I had equipped. Same repair levels. Same mods. Everything. 
---
Replaced my favourite armour with a banana. 
---
On the up side, might be worth hopping into a nice set of PA and dropping the chassis to see what happens. 
---
Haven’t had this happen since. A relog has always fixed it since then, but that particular chassis stayed unplaceable for over a week before I decided to drop it and see what happened. 
---
I think the queen only spawns if they make it to the island, and as the quest itself hasn't worked for me in some weeks I stopped trying.
---
* **Re-open Vault 76**: it would load you into your own personal instance. Inside you would have a Bethesda/Zenimax account stash box that could be used to transfer items from one alt to another.
---
* **Make tents and canopies block rain**. While minor, it is annoying to have your character try and sleep with rain falling through a tent.
---
* **Extend the range and reduce the cooldown of camp artillery**, or give us more artillery flare effect options (*heavy shell fires fewer shells further, canister fires a cluster munition, sensor flare recon pips all enemies in an area for a designated time, etc*)
---
* **Shrink the size of the C.A.M.P ring** by about 15-20%. Few if any of us have camps that large, but many of us have spawned in without our camps because the circles would've barely overlapped.
---
* **Make Bare Arms apply to all ranged weapons** or give a 3 part strength perk card (Smooth Operator) that reduces rifle weights by 40/60/80% and lets them break 10/20/30% slower.
---
* **Make explosive rounds a Prefix modifier**, or revert the skill back to Fallout 4 and make it an additional 15 damage per shot.
---
* **Let us see what an armor piece is in the inspect window**. Is that Combat Arm a heavy piece? Sturdy?
---
* **Lower creature energy damage resistance**. Energy weapons are actually decent number-wise, its just that everything somehow has a high resistance to energy damage.
---
* **Introduce more ammo types**. 45 is used for too many weapons and 308 is used for too few. Or, rechamber weapons when changing firing class and just balance the respective bullet economies. Semi-auto Combat Rifle? Chambered in 5.56. Change it to full-auto? Caliber changes to 45, and 45 gives a base 54 ammo per craft. If you want to go heavy on damage, power auto shoots 5.56 and powerful semi shoots 308.
---
* **Give us a power armor arm mod for ranged weapons**. Something like ‘Elastomeric Bearings’ that gives 10% weapon stability per arm.
---
* **Let us mod our headgear**. I understand that if there were different helmet armors, we would all wear the strongest helmet and all look the same. Workaround? Introduce headgear mods. That way, a combat armor helm could be just as strong as a top hat. Just adopt the system the Railroad in Fallout 4.
---
In game, in 3rd person view, you should see a speaker icon above your head if your mic is picking up audio.
---
This is getting so annoying for me....
---
YASSSSSSSSSS PLEASE
---
Site B?
---
Did you get any Internal Database plans?
---
Yeah but as of now no one knows, and they respawn every server unlike items
---
Check your in game settings Map -&gt; LB -&gt; Audio ..
---
Nah I had a full auto screecher encounter shortly after the servers came back up 
---
i believe the first fo4 dlc was at least 9 months after RD
---
Sounds like what a duper would say 
---
Where did you get that statue?  Was that part of the Whitespring Busts plan?
---
I've seen those in and around the Glassed Cavern
---
Whats VATS??
---
For sure. Was helping some lower levels fight some Super mutants, figured I'd VATS the SM about 30 or so meters in front of me. JUST KIDDING. I clearly wanted to do an actual 180 to aim at the level 8 player behind me. 
---
Thanks Obama. 
---
This mode allows you to run into a public event and start blasting away without the worry of hitting other randos with friendly fire and accidentally engaging in PvP. Pretty handy, really, but I get what you're saying.
---
Yeah running out of steel first and trouble finding steel are two different things =P  No problems finding more.  Point is, lead has been less of a problem than steel lately.
---
ok so if you find a cooler oriented at exactly 42 degrees, while it is raining and ....
---
Alpha. 
---
You kinda sound like a duper...lmao 
---
your whole rant is useless because we arent taking about a fucking jello shot, it was rum that they were selling
---
Eveey participant gets rewards. Cant accurately remember but most of it was ammo, some caps, xp, and normally grenades or a weapon. But only played 3 times last night
---
I once had a team mate glitch out such that their power armor was see-through except for the arms and legs. So it was a woman in a bra and panties with robot limbs. It looked like anime fan service
---
I mean,  West Virginia was apparently one of them before **plot twist** everyone died because Bethesda didn't want NPCs.
---
Yea lookn for b codes
---
I'm already tripping my balls off but thanks
---
I haven’t verified, but drop levels are supposed to be higher in the southeast. I’ve been saving all mine since beta. 
---
I literally see camp building as the endgame boss
---
If you're wondering about weight do a quick look in your stash. (Console, no weight awareness mods).  If you've got like more than 20 lbs of a particular material at a given time, you can probably dump it, or bulk it.   Steel, Rubber/etc can add up rather quick, and even if they're individually light per piece, you end up with such a high amount if you're not paying attention.  Ironically plastic can be somewhat rarer depending on your farming approach, so bulking may not always be an option, but it can turn stuff into another minor caps generating resource.
---
as a WV native I will now use best Virginia to describe where my state, ty
---
It's a puzzle game in itself to figure out all the rules and inconsistencies and glitches and work around that. They make building way too hard and restrict us so much that most of the time I can't build what I wanted after working on it for hours, and some of it just feels so arbitrary. Like why does this kind of stair need to snap to foundations? Why can't I build the farm fencing on upper floors? Why can't I make 1 unit long walls? Why can't this item be placed through cement but it can go through this rocky cliff? Fo4s building needed work but it still had better building than this game and way more possibilities with its pieces and freedom. I can't just build something how I want it, I have to constantly fight the game to get something half decent.
---
So... did codes get changed? Trying to launch now, and the code I'm using apparently isn't valid.
---
I have all the site B aswell
---
OMG please sell me the wetsuit
---
Don't feel ridiculous. It's a terribly vague message, especially for something like this when we want to be ultra cautious about not blowing up important/rare mods.
---
Wow. This game is something else. 
---
They just go and have there friends kill them.
---
You need a Railway Weapon. When you shoot a railway ammo, you can visually see where you shot it. If you shoot it precisely at the same spot you shot your previous railway ammo (aka a nail on a nail) you basically create a faux-ledge. 
---
This is obviously not intentional and not really a QoL tip since this is something that should be fixed... becaused physics
---
Don't rush. Just follow the quests or you'll be back tracking.
---
Yes and "Fireman's poles" for are bases lol
---
Adhesive/Screws is ridiculous, EVERYTHING you do shouldn't require them, it's lazy to make it so. For example, I shouldn't need 3 rolls of duct tape to make a scope, but I would probably burn through a lot of glass and aluminum instead. Also, if I can make a night-vision scope out of copper, glass and steel. I should be able to make a handful of screws out of steel.
---
i never run out of this, and i have more than 100 springs sitting in my stash without duping anything, just playing and scavenge the right junk... just get good
---
and i'm not counting the times i fall into the fisures or people killed me and loot all the springs that i was carrying until i started to store them 
---
Oh the trade glitch that was hoax.  Another one who doesnt play and just regurgitates what he is told.  
---
Yes got patched, there is  thread not too long ago that confirms this. But you know how it is, they will find another
---
Can confirm, got my butt handed to me by one up at the northern fissure. Ran down there to check it out since people had posted that they were closed and got destroyed.  
---
Use spotlights, they increase turret accuracy and range. The bug where they stop lighting up or moving is just visual, their script still works.
---
I would still very much like to see the total weight of multiple objects displayed next to the quantity
---
As long as the mob is at full health it does double dmg. Very sexy indeed
---
Probably because every new bethesda game is in some way worse than the previous one.
---
This is so true. It’s the new thing to hate. COD was the thing to hate for quite a while but not so much anymore 
---
How did you only use 2 cores in 6 hours? I run Full Charge 2 and Power User 3 at all times, and I go through a core every 30 minutes. Maybe my character is bugged?

Me and my boyfriend are both experiencing all of these issues together on separate computers while we play together. 
---
- please can you add a “rejoin server” option for even just 5 mins after a disconnect. We are getting overwhelmingly frustrated when we have a workshop we have sunk time and resources in to and we lose it after 10 minutes because the server disconnects. I could handle the disconnects being this frequent if we could go back to the same server and keep the workshop until I decide to quit the game for the day or someone else wants to take it off me. We really want to claim a workshop at the start of our day playing the game so we get a couple of hours of use out of it, but the game often disconnects 5 mins after we claim the workshop and build all of the extractors and generators and we end up losing all of our resources and hard work. I wonder if this is why a lot of people don’t claim workshops in the first place now.
---
- paper bag seems to disappear through the map when dropping items for players. We drop things to give each other and are losing so many important things. The only way around this is to manually trade free items to each other but this is tiresome and has its own issues 
---
- we really need the ability to lock items we don’t want to scrap. Scrapping items is so risky when you can easily scrap important things. I know this has been mentioned a lot so I’m not going to say any more on this.
---
Thank you 
---
Correct; all of these things are from the FO4 DLC Far Harbor.
---
I had pacifism mode on and if I tried to take a workshop I could be killed all the same. Found that out the hard way. 
---
Also had an instance where my buddy in my team was losing the ammo factory to someone and when I showed up to stop them I was only doing 'slap' damage to them, but my friend attacking another player that he was fighting put my whole team in combat with that guy. How does that work? 
---
I still pick up sugar. Incase im short in ap and need to run (usually running from scorch beast),.
---
The game came out two months ago. Kinda too late to brainstorm game mechanics from your couch.
---
My fusion cores still weight 3lbs a piece 
---
Good, fuck em. If you're gonna stop playing because your broken, ridiculously OP weapon that you bought a duped copy of actually was properly balanced, then by all means, kick rocks. 
---
White Springs golf course has lots of flat areas.
---
I don't,  however: When you get far enough into the quest the Enclave bunker has its own 4 part tutorial on how to do it on the wall. You can press button next to each required step to get them explained.  Additionally, like all quests, relevant locations will be marked on your map as you need to access the.
---
It's a well known visual bug, I sometimes experience it myself. I just try to sell some small junk item whenever I think a vendor doesn't show the correct cap quantity.
---
mark down? As in keep a list? What if we are already level 100 unsure of which plans we have? 
---
Initial log in and loading seemed noticeably faster on PS 4 Pro...
---
A lot of these changes seem really petty, with a few much needed fixes in it as well, but all the “take song X off the radio” or buff automatic weapons AGAIN is pretty low on my wish list. 
---
Im sorry its not been able to work from your end; as far from what I know, majority has not ever mentioned any issue from my personal perspective.
---
This is an addon that requires a bit more custom installation than your typical addon (since its still quite early in its release) so thats usually been the main factor to why it wouldnt work.
---
I'm not using one from nukacrypt this time. Tried from gearnuke, as they claim it's this week, but it apparently isn't.

Nah, I feel very exclusive in my blackbird 
---
The ones in whitespring are even free range!
---
Like any Bethesda game, hunting down those rare items you dont have. Then you hit a wall and stop playing.
---
From what I understand that is how it works. I turned Pacifism mode on, tried to claim a workshop and was murdered post haste. Is that not the case anymore?
---
I DC'd while doing this once. Lost 3 chassis and a few bits. Thankfully the 2 full suits were back in my inventory. But after that I stopped collecting power armor and never leave it placed without jumping in. 
---
Get a pet theyll f them up while youre gone
---
&gt; I just hate exploring so much
---
No offense but it seems like this is *really* not the type of game for you. 
---
Same here. Try a .45 pipe revolver. It’s my go to. 
---
I was under the impression that Bethesda would be updating us the public portions of these patches. 
---
this needs to be the number on fix, I appreciate that a full chassis is only 10 pounds, but there needs to be a better system of naming or preview them when stored.   
---
It's going to be a bunch of idiots Marsupial jumping constantly and trying to to hit each other with their two-shots. It's going to look fucking comical. 
---
Tse = two shot explosive 
---
Stalkers? Yes 
---
Ticks? No. 
---
I just got 2 but for one i put one piece of atom paint so it has the symbol beside the chasis in the inventory
---
It doesn't, but stuff we build actually takes up less space BUT that means you have to scrap older pieces currently. I scrapped and rebuilt  a chunk of my camp and it freed up some space. But I'm talking like 20 level difference before you notice anything. 
---
Hopefully we get lucky and the code is figured out quickly
---
It is a heavy weapon.  I am running +30% to HW damage for this shot.  Base 1 shot damage is like 17-19.
---
Yeah, keep a list. It's really hard, either just buy Plans you think you dont have, or get a Mod for it from Nexusmods.com
---
I've killed the queen over 100 times, and I've never got 1 recipe for serums, what's the drop rate?
---
How do you check what the challenges are?  I just feel lucky when one pops up as complete! 🤗
---
Although, yeah, upon checking, it's clearly last week's code posted as this week's code. Sorry to waste your time with an idiot question.
---
Last patch that actually had some changes/fixes was December 11th, they even called the 19th patch a hot fix themselves it fixed like one small thing and we aren't getting anything this week. So that will be a month easy with very little fixes.
---
That is for sure 100% the case.
---
Just make it so the names only show for you and other players see the default names.
---
Yep put a hour into setting something up just to have a guy come over an one hit you. PvP is pathetic just like half the player base.
---
I have level 3 of the bandolier perk and he's correct. Some of my ammo weighs nothing. My 5mm says zero and I have 8,000 plus rounds. Awesome if you're in ammo hoarder like me! 
---
That is how it worked in FO4, but not in 76. Int only affects the quality of gear you craft, the amount of return you get for scrapping and the number of wrong answers that show up while hacking. It says as much when you look at your special stats in your pip boy.
---
You are comparing their model to the model of those games? That is massively unfair because they are vastly different.
---
&gt; this sort of behavior shouldn't be tollerated with an upfront cost game like this.
---
Why? Most of the bigger online games do it in order to supplement their development costs and basic operation. Guild Wars 2 does it to great success.
---
&gt; Would you be fine if developers deliberately shipped base games looking like crap or with no textures to encourage cosmetic buys?
---
Naturally, no, but they haven't done that so that isn't really a relevant argument here.
---
&gt; Would it be better if they technically let you earn some of it free after 200hrs of play?
---
How is that much different than locking content behind a grind of any other type?
---
&gt; if they did do this and got back lash what old scummy trick would seem saintly by comparison?
---
They haven't, so that is again, irrelevant.
---
Oh, what level? My Bloodied DCG is lvl 40 so a bump to a level 50 one would be highly appreciated if you’re wanting to swap.  
---
After any weapons in particular?
---
Still happening to me as of 1/2/19 - the terminal in the PO only has lookup by First/Last name; no PO Box number lookup selection in the terminal. Le Sigh. I've been trying this terminal in Clarksburg about twice a week for over a month to see if it would appear for me. I wish I could just restart the quest, obviously something is glitched/bugged with this one still.
---
Intentions of that would be around the large update coming up this month.  
---
This was a unintentional fix because the issues that arose around the silos. They probably or could have snuck a couple quick fixes in before the big major update to ease things a lot and a better transition.
---
Good doggy, lead belly rank 3, and bloodsucker.  Food/drink/heal problems solved.
---
It's definitely gonna happen. Atom shop/DLC release. 
---
Nope, still weights nothing.
---
Lol OK Hoss... Maybe you don't understand how many people more than likely it would affect...
---
Nah
---
Probably because the keypad should be on the outside and the switch on the inside
---
Because it’s what a shit ton of people do at end game? 
---
Nukes are a majority of the endgame content, and you’re doing your best to make them seem excessively trivial and unnecessary to fix.  If you’re going to lodge a complaint, don’t be ignorant to things just because it doesn’t fit your opinion, as that’s a bit pathetic. 
---
They’ve been on holiday break and considering duping in GTA, I’m sure it’s not even close to as simple a fix as you would like to make it out to be.  
---
If you think they shouldn’t fix any small simple bugs, just because duping is still a problem, then I personally think that’s just about the stupidest thing I’ve heard this year.  
---
I’d like to piggy back off YOUR comment by saying that the NukaGirl suit should have a male version.
---
I bought it by accident (because the shop has it labeled RocketSuit on the front page and only adds the girl part when you Inspect it.) Well it was a waste because there is no way my male character will ever wear that monstrosity. I’m inclined to think it’s intentional sabotage by calling it “Rocketsuite” on the home screen to encourage accidental purchases, but maybe I’m just dumb.
---
Yes. Had a guy using that Marsupial, bird bone mutation combo with a laughable amount of stealth boys and TSE weapons. He absolutely destroyed my friends and I for no reason, and when we wouldn't fight back he just destroyed my base. Had like a 400 bounty, but who is gonna stop him? Not to mention he took our caps Everytime he killed us. 
---
While you're at it, give us a hardened .50 call reciever for it too!
---
You expect them to allow us to put stuff on shelves?  ROFL.  This is BGS!  You'll have empty shelves and love it!  Aren't they great?  Isn't it great?
---
got one now for Charlie: G-3  hope it helps :)
---
Can somone give it to him, don't have a  twitch account, and it didden like my fb account...
---
Your words say one thing, your actions say another. End of the day, pacifist mode exist, teach yourself to use it, and it will solve your underlying problem bud. Hope you have better experiences out there. &lt;3
---
Start the quest Bunker Buster.
---
I'm sure it'll get solved in an hour or so.
---
Other parts are broken now.  The codes have reset due to the hot fix.  No problem I’ll hunt them down, but the surveillance terminals at the enclave bunker aren’t working.  
---
Ill be happy if duping is indeed patched, and no work arounds get discovered 
---
Drool...
---
Work your way towards Abbie's Bunker in the top right corner of the map, that'll get you started on the Enclave and Brotherhood quests - it has some crossover with the main quest too. Also have you done the Mistress of Mystery quests yet? That one has a fair bit of running around and you might discover more as you travel. 
---
Note that some quests give you scaled rewards so wait until you're a higher level for a more powerful weapon, I'm leaving the Watoga mayor one until level 50 for the legendary super sledge, for example. Not sure if there is a list of those weapon quests anywhere.
---
5mm, .45, .44, .38 all zero for me.  5.56 is .001
---
What you dont like seeing your guys belly button? I think its funny
---
I ran into two diseased ones at once in that pink tree Grove or whatever it's called. I ran and ran
---
If you want some help, my PSN is zomburger57
---
I’m about to hit alpha too! 
---
Didnt know this one was an MMO there captain fucktard.  But its all good.  You should get your mommy to bring you a snickers, you're acting like a bitch again.
---
They can't even show moderate interest in making the base game work.  
---
Why would you want that?
---
This may be a dumb question but when you uninstall a mod on power armor do you lose it? I had reactive plates on my XO-1 and added the stealth boy, thinking you could switch them out. The reactive plates are gone though so I assume it deletes one mod for another? 
---
"BUTTFUCKER'S BLOODIED POOL CUE"
---
I just saw the nukacrypt guy doing his stream for alpha thank god lol
---
Lol so true
---
This looks super similar to a build I'm planning, except I wasnt planning to run any mutations. Is this viable without them?
---
You need them and the keyword together. But one without the other is useless. 
---
I just had a thought, maybe let us hotkey our favourite power armor as well. 
---
Sorry, furious, not instigating. Instigating is the one that I have. Need a furious for the Scorched Queen.
---
Hopefully not atom shop since it would break the "only cosmetic" aspect. 
---
Yeah, I'm just waiting for the day I get a Two-shot Explosive Gauss Rifle so that I can knock those sonic-blast-spamming m'fers out of the sky. The last one I made a bid on (for 5k) they came back with 10 million caps (as a joke) but still...
---
Thanks man.  Just got back home so im getting ready to dive in again if its back up.
---
&gt; Yeah but as of now no one knows
---
/facepalm
---
I wish. I had 3 SB teamed up and destroyed my CAMP yesterday. Had to vendor hop to get the mats to rebuild.  http://imgur.com/a/x0P38Ol
---
You know what I mean 😪
---
That's just rude. Bastards.
---
Fusion Cores are Energy Ammo, theres a separate perk for them
---
Dupers havent even gotten to third program methods, im feeling unoptimistic 
---
Green country lodge, charleston fire department, and then hit all the nuke silos. Theres training weights there which net you some serious lead.
---
Well I'm the only one who tried to do something like this and I managed to time it right with the servers going down, so I'd say a hefty potentially
---
Ouch. That is rough. I some times feel like they heat-seek me and find me everywhere I go on the map.
---
What’s his stream?
---
I hear ya. I was just stating how you could do it. And if you are on pc you can set a macro and no have to do anything else but wait. Which is what a lot of people are doing. 
---
The bushwhacker brothers
---
I haven’t purchased it yet (waiting for a cool power armor paint to come out) but I think the new dark laminate flooring looks real good.  
---
How long will the servers be down haven’t been home at all to play today.
---
Whatever makes you feel better, man. 
---
RealPureSavagery on twitch 
---
Haha not quite. We worked on a pre-loading feature that would allow people who were viewing slices of a patient's CT scan to preload in the direction they were viewing + 20 images. If they moved forward, it would start loading forward, and if they moved backwards... same, but in the opposite direction. Each image load was queued up and would ping the server as several requests. However, this froze the interface as we made multiple requests. The users would get frustrated, scroll back and forth, and queue up a ton more images in each direction because their client was spamming the server with load requests.   
---
We eventually did fix it - took a few weeks to implement and test out. :)
---
Could an obstruction be in the way?
---
Yeah, was thinking about either astroturf or dark laminate, bought laminate.
---
No world hopping required, you can immediately press the button to dig again.
---
nukacrypt has a 'how it works' explenation.. there are other guides around as well.. some posts on reddit too
---
I think someone that has absolutely no desire to play and give this game a chance yet posts on this subreddit needs to get a fucking life 
---
I only use one turret, it’s at the bottom of the stairs behind a wall so it’ll only activate if I need to retreat to the base and I’m being chased.
---
But if the turret does kill anything I still get the loot and at lvl 120 I’m not really concerned about missing out on Xp.
---
you can also stack after purifiers, even on top of other things like shelves, to put them up in the air for and air base or if you are in an area with enemies that destroy them
---
There are chickens in game though
---
Is there anything I can do to help?  I have never launched a nuke, but I have the quest "I am become death" and have already worked myself most of the way through BRAVO.
---
No because they redacted the need to do that. 
---
And they reinstated ppl that modded the game.
---
Only actually cheaters running a small pool of exes got banned and they were right.
---
What time is reset generally?
---
Wow I did not know that, thank you.
---
I typically use the pipe revolver secondary to my bolt action pistol, but I’ve replaced it with a 10mm pistol recently because my .45 ammo supply got low. 
---
It’s part of the game pal, do your worst. 
---
It is back up, I'm playing right now
---
My camp spawns visitors inside of a foundation that is underwater. They also can't seem to fast travel out. 
---
I've invested too much time in my camp to move it or redesign it, but I play with my wife and son and it screws them over when they travel there to catch dysentery or die.
---
It's bullshit and since Bethesda removed the fast travel mat after the BETA I can't fix it. 
---
I've been attacked by 3 dudes with TSE guns and it didnt affect me whatsoever in pacifist mode 
---
My conspiracy is; when your CAMP has been in the same spot for a while, they will seek out your CAMP to get you to move to a different location. 
---
Anyone got bravo code :D?
---
Treasure maps do not drop legendaries T-60 X-01 plans. 
---
You get regular weapons, armors, few caps, and plans (not the rare ones). Tested on about 120 maps.   
---
I know t60 starts at 40, so t51 is probably 30ish
---
I have the light laminate flooring, it looks good, but the nice floors seem out of place when they are put together with the old beat up walls. I find myself going back to the old wood flooring most of the time.
---
BRAVO JUST GOT DECRYPTED!!!
---
You are absolutely right. These "journalists" have not touched the game, they just rewatch the Bethesda announcement conference from e3 and start writing.
---
Fairly low. But depends. I’ve had a friend who got two within her first 15 queens. I didn’t get a single one for first 50 queens and then respec’ed and got a bit luckier lol 
---
BTW...not me.   
---
The mid 30s and mid 40s also suck
---
Lmao no it’s not fixed. They made it even easier 😂 You don’t have to craft anything anymore. 
---
Fuck it, it’s yours now 
---
For simplicity sake lets assume the Max Base CND Value is 100. It can be over repaired up to 200.
---
So if you have a minimum of lets say 100 CND Value the item can drop:
---
 - 100 Base CND
---
 - 90 Base CND &amp; 10% Over Repair
---
 - 80 Base CND &amp; 20% Over Repair
---
 - 70 Base CND &amp; 30% Over Repair
---
etc..
---
If they get brought in they will 99.9% be free dlc that will be scattered around the world e.g. harpoon guns and radium rifles in  fallout 4
---
Welllllllll fuck me for being an eighties baby and living in this wonderful tiny multicultural city in Canada.  haha Just playing,  but I actually didn't know that.  Apparently I have been avoiding them without even knowing it. 
---
Here I thought people would confuse me with a Mcdonalds sandwich from the eighties.  
---
What you can craft is affected by intelligence.  Anything over 100% adds to DR/ER.  What you find on mobs is affected by luck.  Again anything over 100% adds to DR/ER.  There's also light/medium/heavy types of most armors which has different min/max DR/ER.
---
It was always like that for me
---
If they don't, you can thank all those "asset flip" complainers.
---
Victrhugochavez , we're very opposite. 
---
I've got rank 3 packrat, and every piece of junk I store in my stash is 10 times heavier than it would be in my inventory.  I've also got the perks for food, drink, and chem weight reduction.  So my stash is mostly for weapons, extra grenades, heavy armor, and junk that's too valuable to be lost if I die.
---
Like hammurabi1337 said, hoarder problems.
---
Ive had that in the nuke zones,  where it won't accept at all.   Glitchy at the best of times, still love it though.  
---
It's linked on their site.
---
Does everyone need to be spoon fed every goddamned thing?
---
Check the website NUKA CRYPT
---
A lotta people hate it though? It's cool to hate on microtransactions so it's definitely cool to hate on.
---
I lean towards this being the cause.  The same way the 95% hit can not hit because the mob happens to move slightly behind a tree, or other sort of obstruction.  They remain visible, the number remains 95, but technically the game interprets it as 'you want to shoot the wall'.
---
Lmao oh boy...
---
Ran into 3 of those guys... on a foggy day in the mountains lol. Not kidding.
---
A post did an analysis of perks when using power armour, all the ones that increase action point regen and also serendipity don’t work with power armour on. 
---
I’m set up west of Morgantown because i’m a lvl. 6 noob and my turrets do basically nothing. The only thing they’ve killed so far are the fucking bees that spawn in a hive near my house.
---
Oh god. I just learned I've done this... like a couple weeks ago.  GD!
---
Yeah fingers crossed if it isn't cosmetic it will be a DLC release. I'm hoping for something like the GRA DLC for new vegas.
---
Also, you can share a 1 point card with only 2 charisma... possibly 1, but I haven't tested it.  My charisma was only 2 for a long time, still able to share a 1 point per card.
---
Thx guys, I haven't paid attention in all work-benches
---
Since your lvl 120, hope you don't mind a follow-up. I'm a super casual gamer, highest character is lvl 45. Why do I still see lvl 100+ people at WS when it's not nuked? The xp has to be minimal for you, are the legionaries leveled?
---
A guy who has read some articles and watched some videos thinks he knows enough about the game to write an essay that would "obliterate" them. You kids really need hobbies.
---
your base will be hit with repeated orbital strikes now....
---
Did that then you can’t get out
---
Guess that won't be a problem for me, i got concrete walls.
---
between the hunters cabin and the space station there's a junk pile but not much else around, I don't know exactly where but somewhere in the area between 
---
Been looking for this exact gun but on Xbox. If someone has one, I'll always buy it. 
---
If you want more damage and not use power armor, do a low health build with a set of unyeilding. 
---
Anyone finding her radio channel too soft? Almost like as if you had turned on one of the world-radios not your pipboy one.
---
It should def be fixed, but it also definitely could be a lot of stupid fun
---
Does it give any buffs?
---
I'm so done with the tattered dress.
---
[Hope this helps](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Fallout+76+abandoned+waste+dump)
---
Or, you know, pony up $20 for a fast pony.
---
I also have this conspiracy: once you reach a certain level you somehow manage to run into them more and more often. At a low level I rarely see them, even when wandering in high level zones. But when I pass a certain treshold they suddenly pop up everywhere.
---
I've been trying to these and the lever-action plans for a while now, doing Patrol Duty and checking every vendor. No luck. Several people suggest we just level an alt, but I personally don't want to do that (nor do I think it makes any sense).
---
I've also tried to buy the plans from others but no takers yet (on PS4).
---
I think we’re either neighbors or your camp swelled mine.
---
+1 during a rando team uranium quest, felt like a total clown. With clown suit.
---
I made my first set of X-01 last week and got calibrated shocks on the first and second hop. Took nearly 30 hops for the tactical red lamp. 
---
Pure luck of the draw (or a blessing from Atom)
---
I got one even better: it's all virtua l reality. We never left that vault and never will.
---
Pay attention to the date and time on your pip boy. 
---
Did this with a glowing snallygaster that glitched out the same way :) 
---
If you haven't fixed it yet, power the switch box to use the keypad. Then power a pressure plate by the door, then from the powered pressure plate power the middle of the door frame and it will act as a switch to get out. Alternatively you can also use a terminal connected to your wired Network, Inside your base to activate the switch box thats on the power gate to open the switch on the close it by using the terminal or entering the key code.
---
Cool idea but I’m sure they made loads of money selling the rights to fallout to Bethesda , I doubt Bethesda would be down to do that for them 
---
Waaaaaa waaaaaa that’s a bad defense waaaaa 
---
Take your pick on why this game is shit, and has the bad reviews that it does: 
---
Bugged quests, caps exploits, XP exploits, duping exploits, unrewarding nonsensical end game legendary mobs, the joke of an atomic shop, server crashes, how the game is literally copied textures from FO4, admit the game sucks you fanboy lmaoooo
---
A broken mutfruit tree takes 3 mutfruit to repair from the CAMP station menu.  However, it only takes 1 mutfruit to repair directly at the plant.  I think this holds true for all plants.
---
But, you are correct, just scrap it and plant a new one.
---
This is great! I can't get my boots wet without getting parasites!
---
Don't worry. Might lose the item if they ever wipe but I doubt it. It's at the point the market has been flooded so significantly that many players would quit or cease to play for a period of time since so many people have those items. 
---
They are just as annoying to high levels due to them dropping literally nothing worth fighting them, even if they only take a swing or two from a melee weapon or a couple TSE rounds.  
---
They usually do manage to put in a few hits on ones armor still resulting in some slight wear and tear for no reward.  I really hope they fix that soon. 
---
Sometimes people do it just to get across the map without having to pay.  Ive done it a few times and end up making some pretty sweet buds.   
---
I did that one time to get from Grafton down to the Ash Heap so I could work on getting black Titanium and he ended up hanging with me getting my excavator armor.    :)   I didnt have quite enough and he ended up giving me 17 gears and 10 screws so I could finish it up.   What a saint.
---
The one you like most.
---
WOOT.  that was the Silo i was workign on
---
I just want CRANBERRIES
---
Damn.  I need that,  but I still don't want to buy batteries for my controller.  
---
It looks like the spawn point wraps relative to the position of the camp. Would be brilliant to work out the pattern. This vid helps! I'll have a play around.
---

Ooh no. My TSE Handmade is the only reason I don't get murdered by people 40+ levels below me. 
---
Imagine my surprise when a Two Shot lever action dealing 250+ damage took a little over a 1/10 of a level 17 guys health and his pump action shredded me. 
---
I ONLY ever defend my workshops, I never fight for them. Pvp is so weird so I try to avoid it, although I do like bounty hunting and wasteland justice. 
---
I just don't like having to walk backwards while dumping 100+ rounds into everything I fight. I only really use my TSE Handmade for overwhelming fights, like SB or 10+ SM at the same time. 
---
Add me on Xbox! Raynesidius
---
Ill be on later tonight! 
---
Great list, how I wish the patchnote would evwn come close. 
---
Just have someone craft them for you?
---
I don't understand why you're limiting yourself to literally only plans you yourself have.  Enough people have the rarest plans that you can get jet-packs and shocks for even the T51b made for mats+tip easily.
---
Sold,  I will when I get home tonight.  
---
I have two shot with faster fire rate....it's mad
---
So the actual design of the powered door is flawed.  I don't mean turn it around, i mean they put them on the wrong side.  The keypad is on the inside of the door.  Why would you want a keypad to exit a building?  You'd want it to enter the building.  Also is the switch broken?  People keep saying the switch doesn't even work.  Which would be what you would use to get out of the door.
---
Nope. I’ve had my hillside camp with a view since day one. No scorchies.
---
"Needs to get a fucking life." 
---
As we are on a subreddit about a video game... Lol
---
You originally said 0 changes or fixes, you're moving goal posts.
---
Dec. 11th patch lackluster? Push to talk, re-speccing and fixing the camp boot problem where small but critical changes people where continually asking for. So long as the camp issue was their people like me weren't doing anything with a major game feature.
---
And that patch also had tons of small bug fixes that cumulatively increase the enjoyment of the game. 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/1EDxoSmqFye0QYa2GyQw2u/fallout-76-patch-notes-december-11-2018
---
They may be small to you but to others many of these issues really impacted them.
---
yeah i’m watching the guy on twitch rn just waiting lol but yeah hopefully he’s able to get it soon! 
---
No, you're fine.
---
You can dupe it 100 times yourself and you'll still be fine. 
---
That is a good idea, I'll try that! 
---
Hmmm..... Can anyone say... Atom Shop Exclusive!
---
the power station n of watoga. cranberries and a death claw next door. 1 cap fast travel to Vendor Bot Phoenix , about 7 to Camp Venture
---
This is all from mobs. I don't craft anything I just mod what I find. So there is RNG creating a range for my defense stats? Why are the normal pieces always the same and the legendary pieces almost always inferior?
---
You take my BOS officer suit and BOS combat armor! TAKE IT. 
---
There's one on the bank of the Ohio River North of Point Pleasant.
---
The servers did go down for maintenance today, and the error message you received is what it says when you log in during these down times, have you tried again recently now that the servers are back up?
---
Yeah they cloned Fallout 4
---
Wait, so when I see a robot in the wasteland, that is actually another person from Vault 76 that thinks they are a person from Vault 76 and not the robot chassis? Or they are the ones the virtual overlay is broken on?
---
Yeah, you lose the mods when you remove them.
---
Just had my brothers-in-law test it
---
I was just thinking about this today actually, I have full sets of every armor except Ultracite and I cant pick up my T-60 or my X-01 yet because I'm not a high enough level. If I could just see which armor I actually have that would be amazing 
---
I said NOT a stripper! Ah forget it. Ill put a pole up in my camp.
---
I keep hoping they'll readd the fast travel mat from BETA. 
---
not thread worthy
---
I agree. XB1 pain in the ass here also
---
Like always, the keyword should slowly appear in the coming days. You can't say they're broken if you don't wait first. 
---
That was my first thought as well. 
---
You have good eyes.
---
I mean over 200%.  You can't repair to 230%, so if it drops at 230 (what does that even look like?) you can never repair it back up to 230, correct?  
---
Lets put points on it.  If the base item as 100 points of durability, and you farm one up at 230%, that's 230 points of durability.  Can I then repair that to 460 points of durability?  Or can I only repair it to 200 points of durability?
---
Other perks and things like decom shower make this a bit of a waste of points later on.
---
They absolutely do exist. I've seen them three times and bought them.  But, RNG is a bitch. One day, I spent six hours server hopping and never found one. The next day I found two in about three hours time. Just keep at it, eventually you'll get it.  
---
If you absolutely need to carry weight now, just grab a set of T-60 legs and grinds for T-60 calibrated shocks at the Watoga station. I read somewhere that they spawned more often. I've even seen them myself a few times, and I don't go to Watoga very often.
---
If someone takes your workshop they should automatically be hostile against you. How can you defend if they don't fight back. Worst is if you kill them YOU get a bounty not them. Needs adjustments for sure and I love PVP
---
No. A hotfix is an out-of-band fix that gets applied on its own because shit's extraordinarily fucked.
---
For me, this has been a literal lifesaver.
---
I didn’t check nukacrypt yet. But I found the following guide. That’s some complicated stuff. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9vhtnv/a_comprehensive_guide_on_how_to_launch_nukes/?st=JQFRUFQ3&amp;sh=a81c7891
---
So you now need to find the keyword :)) to decipher your letters. The deciphered letters should make up a word. The word should act as a guide to the position of each digit which should be similar to the position of each letter of the deciphered word. Good luck 😉 
---
They just made a hotfix for it
---
This could actually be it. Especially with the “lacking requirements” bit.
---
That’s fantastic if it really happens, but loot games tend to accrue a lot of folklore. I remember being told back in the EverQuest days how “pristine” pelts were more likely to drop if you killed animals with blunt weapons. 
---
When one character had charisma 1, a 200 cap outfit sold for 20, so 10% of value.  My charisma 15 hard bargain 3 character sells 200 cap outfits for 50, so at 25% value, and that’s probably hitting a limit.   A not-quite-accurate-but-easy-to-think-about guideline would be starting at 10% and then add about 1% per charisma and a little more than 2% for each hard bargain rank (but the progression is probably not linear like that).
---
Can’t offer an explanation, but I had the same problem this morning and I moved on with a plan to come back again later. 
---
Im doing the same. Add xXCookster14Xx on xbox live if you want to join me
---
When I come across these I generally just close the back door. It seems to block some of their targeting.
---
I have heard that getting rid of notes and Holotapes that aren’t as important, or ones that are old seems to fix the problem for the most part aside from the normal occasional crashing.
---
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE!!!! sorry for yelling but yeah Bethesda needs to add this! haha
---
lol well to be fair the dupe patch has been sitting there available for a while now, understandable for them to sneak it in with this.  
---
thats gonna cost you extra
---
did the daily trigger and tell you to go talk to him?
---
It seems the dailies arent really dailies. Try server hopping until it tells you to talk to him.
---
Same. I get that it's a survival game and they want you to scavenge and forage and all that, and I'll even give them that some of the plants are weird mutant plants like the tarberries and firecracker berries, but there's no reason whatsoever that I shouldn't be able to plant cranberries. Like even if you have to find non-diseased berries, I still feel like they should be something you can grow.
---
I look forward to the fixes when I know they’re coming. They still don’t even update their launcher with maintenance alerts so you have to go directly to their website to stay updated. 
---
It’s just disappointing when you get home late, eat dinner and hope to play an hour or two only to find out there’s maintenance for an undetermined amount of time. 
---
I live in the UK so for me the fix was during prime gaming hours. 
---
I want it!
---
“yelling”

Low Life Sniper w/ Pipe Weapons. Double dip a dropped pistol converted into a rifle w/ 5x Unyielding Armor.

If PvPing use 4x Unyielding and 1x Chameleon With your 30+ AGI and cloaking no one will see you ever.

---
This leaves 2 perks up to you.
---
If the double dipping is fixed remove the 3 points in AGI, remove 3/3 pipe weapon in INT. 5 Points into Ranged Weapons Mastery. 
---
3 Perks up to you.
---
You cannot scrap them 
---
The fact that you can only buy/sell things for caps in the player trade menu is really, really weak. Item for item trading should have been in the game at launch and that kind of oversight I think is indicative of BGS's entire attitude toward this game.

Issue: Trophy "Appalachian Trailblazer" did not unlock after reaching level 25, days ago. I am now level 29 and still without the trophy. Please fix.
---
This post is a bit demanding and sounds ungrateful. 
---
Also pretty sure the game is slowly changing to allude to new dlc e.g fissure sites appearing closed. 
---
Yup. And scout armor too. Would love me a set of weightless scout armor.
---
as in theres no way to see if you already have a plan or not when browsing through any vendor's list
---
Same way you access regular terminals.  Only difference is when you meet a locked terminal you will be greeted with a minigame (hacking) before actually being able to view its content.
---
I know where to get them lol I just want to find how to mod them? Because you cannot scrap them only repair. 
---
*reads title* ...risky click of the day...
---
Cannot be tamed sadly.
---
lol the laugh and snorting was great
---
Dark laminate or normal laminate look great with brick walls, also grab the mosaic tiles floor when its back on store again.
---
As someone who had been apart of another game this happened to, I can tell you complaining won't help anything. 
---
Sea of Thieves had plenty of this shit for months after launch and recently had trouble with a gaming site literally copy pasting content and ideas from the games Reddit onto their site. 
---
I won't comment on the contents and opinions of the article, as mine aren't the most positive towards 76 anymore. 
---
My advice is to ignore clickbait articles like these and DO NOT click on them as your giving them money, which will promote making more. It won't really make that big a difference as bad press sells but if you hate stuff like this don't promote it.
---
That shits for furries lol
---
The servers went down for everyone 
---
I have my camp at the WS backdoor but I use heavy laser turrets with a power switch to turn them off when I'm not home. No power to the turrets, no kill stealing.  When I want to make a quick exp/loot run I will run into the building and spray a couple of rooms to pull aggro then run back to camp and flip on the turrets.
---
Assuming it doesn't already exist, a great companion piece to this would be loot from the Govt. Supply Requisitions.
---
Found a Laser Gatling in one the other day. Mound was literally right over the hill from my camp.
---
They need to fix broken guns then balance them before introducing more
---
I vendored it knowing it was probably used in some recipe because it's not worth it to gather a spice and a piece of meat, get to a stove before the meat spoils, cook an improved food item and miraculously eat it before it spoils.
---
I eat mole rat chunks and carrot soup.
---
I just did the same, only i went to try another daily (Target Rich Environment) and i couldn't get a daily quest there either.
---
+karma yeee boi promot this shit it needs to happen.
---
I have noticed that often when I single click "A" on my xbox controller to interact with loot containers or other items, it does a double-tap and loots the first two items.  I wonder if your experience was something similar with a double-tap glitch?  For this farming run, I had 5 separate stacks of 3 maps and all 5 of them allowed me to loot 3 separate times on each dirt mound.
---
Shit or get off the pot bro. 
---
Better off not mentioning it in the first place, but no worry fam. You're surrounded by friends here. We got a backup of all your items in case you ever need it!
---
Same for items/plans whose long names run into the vendor caps price.
---
How? The nukes are disabled. No on can use them.
---
Doesnt that only work on melee attacks?
---
I did this after getting really salty that somebody else had built where I was, with an inferior base. Dinny take very long for a higher level to come and claim it.
---
I've stopped taking the 95% shots. There's a known bug that I've experienced as well where the number doesn't correspond to the actual percentage. 
---
95% shots basically don't hit for me ever. So I'll wait till it drops to the 70s or 80s. 
---
I mean, it's a wetsuit.
---
They wouldn't be diving in heavy af metal armor.
---
I believe someone mentioned that one is misnamed, the picture and everything looks right but the mound is looking for a different map.
---
I fought and killed one at Tanagra town. They can spawn there but not 100%
---
Also I'd love a way to tell whether my melee weapon is 1 or 2 handed in the inventory screen. Since all melee wpns are swung with 1 hand in PA, there's no efficient way to tell 
---
You better turn them in at the next Charleston gun buy back. Let’s get those duped guns off the wasteland streets. For Gods sake do it for the Ghouls!!! It’s just common sense.
---
dark
---
Bro the scorched ones look so nasty
---
they did a update today to allow launching again and well um thats it 
---
like i said, it is easy to grief in pacifist mode since you are an invincible object that can go around fucking with people. you can be a giant asshole and prevent people from doing everything and nobody can do anything to stop you. there needs to be some sort of control for players to stop you by the time more people figure that out
---
Soups and mole/mongrel meats....
---
Yeah the durability of an item is a range with a minimum and maximum based on your luck.  If its over 100%, bar is filled up and there's a darker bar inside that one partially filled, the DR/ER will go up above normal.
---
I don't know of any reason that simply being legendary would cause lower stats 100% of the time.  It can be if the legendary is light and the non-legendary is heavy.  Or if the legendary is 70% and the non-legendary is 130%.  Or both combined.  Other than that I'd say it was just anecdotal.
---
Oh sorry, can't help you there
---
The daily didn't trigger and i hopped two more times.
---
I tried another daily aswell (Target Rich Environment) and it didn't work either.
---
Honestly, after 15 for each special stat there is some assumptions taking place. I cannot find solid data but assume the diminishing returns has already taken root if any.
---
Some stats have wonky affects where they are point for power more optimal at 5-8 then stagnate up to 15. I assume the values continue under the same limited growth.
---
Higher then 200% is just my formula extrapolating the information if it were to continue at the same rate.
---
It can be a fun game to play after a couple beers
---
Only guns that can break but I've never experienced it breaking are those with the explosive effect. Weapons without this effect work pretty fine and like I said I have never had a broken explosive weapon in the 110 hours of playtime I have 
---
Does the plasma flamer count? Or the beam splitter gatling plasma? Never thought about them before. 
---
I love this event.
---
Why was this post removed? 
---
This happened to him before the servers went down.  But apparently somebody didn't want this seen because they removed his post.
---
Yeah, bring it back permanently and never release limited time bullshit again.
---
He should probably do the Top of the World first cuz it sends you to Abbies after, ya?
---
Truth be told i have them, since it was one of the first limited time items, but is limited time atom shop items appearing on store again confirmed.
---
Nice, finally :D
---
Constant crashing for me as well (PS4)
---
Seems like a nuclear campaign is in order.
---
I wonder if they avoid the naming of items because of the rating. People could come up with super offensive item names and Bethesda has no way of monitoring or censoring any of it so just removing the option all together is a much safer choice.
---
Such a griefer disconnecting should at least get their bounty substracted from their caps and added to their victim. I'm sure that would discourage assholes from ordering an orbital strike or just 'manually' wrecking a camp. Just this week I did a fast teavel to my camp only to see a blue smoke flare for an orbital strike. Everything got wrecked and the guy was nearby so I went to hunt him down but he was gone a few seconds later, leaving me with the cost of repairing it all without deserving that shit. Random mob attack I can deal with, but another player intentionally wrecking your shit and just getting away with it? Hell no.
---
I agree thay people need to stop that but if you not using pacifist mode , that's your own fault.
---
use sentry bot helmet. it looks great with marine armor
---
More importantly, jet pack for days
---
I feel like Miguel's Protectron is the best.
---
Yeah I had to build over so my tower is larger than I wanted. I will end up rebuilding it with your method and hopefully be able to put in some pictures and whatnot.
---
I think some plants should be forage only (like glowing resin from pines, and 'toxic' soot flowers, or the diseased cranberry, etc.) but there's ALOT they could do with farming/ranching that'd make things a shit ton more intersting.
---
I actually made a thread for that a while ago https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a6i7fb/farming_overhaul_in_appalachia/
---
I had 4 Toxic Valley maps of the same number and got to dig 4 times.
---
" you rumor is this game is trash and I cant make my own impression, here's how I would deal with it"  
---
This is something that bugs me, why can’t we name our stuff? What’s stopping them from allowing that? Something technical I assume? 
---
No idea. I guess it just means that it’s a suggestion towards Bethesda. It might make them easier to spot. Only a guess
---
Small compared to other games that aren't in near as desperate and broken of a state as fallout 76. And yes I was wrong there was one small hot fix on the 19th, still doesn't change we are coming up on a month with next to nothing, exploiters running rampant and people constantly crashing out of the game.
---
How would you rule out the loss of caps after the fight for players who are kind of stingy with caps?
---
I think this should work somewhat like GTAV's passive mode. It should completely cutting off the ability to harm others and the ability for others to harm you. I shouldn't have to be noiding out at my camp with pacifist mode on waiting to get one shotted by a TSE before I even think to fight back. Can't even say how many times this has happened to me. Many camps destroyed by 150+ level players. 
---
I believe interplay (Obsidian) made 1.5 million when they sold it to Beth in the late 1990's early 2000's.
---
Don't quote me on the full value. But I think fallout 3 was the best that Beth made fallout 4 was better graphics wise but the story was ehh. Then there's 76 that still has flourishing trees with no permanent damage to the eco system (glowing sea from 4, green sky's from 3, brotherhood mission from fallout 1)
---
I'm just tired of Bethesda ruining something I love. 
---
Thank you for the info!
---
Or even better take a shot every time you grab the wrong set!
---
Watched the vid twice and shared with my people. That is some amazing !@#$%
---
Maybe. Or the were planing on it but had more important things to do first
---
Hi, we're you able to launch a nuke with this code? Because after this maintenance I'm not sure if they gonna work 
---
I don't speak for everyone but if our base in that spot we are there fighting and farming legendaries. We don't leave it there and do other things no point other tha  giving other players workstations to repair which we don't mind. If you attack the base or would have to be intentionally. Set pretty high off the ground. Stray bullets arent going to hit it usually which means prepare for a fight. Lol. We like PVP to
---
Ooohhhhh, that's why I thought I lost a couple pieces of power armor. Sucks that you cant even see the armor on the chassis too
---
I was sitting on about 4000+ .38 rounds with 3\* Bandolier perk... Realizing that I don't use them and can probably save some weight, I decided to drop all 4000+ .38 rounds.  1 pound.  4000+ .38 rounds = 1 pound. CRAZY! lol
---
I have been noticing that happening lately and wondering why, thanks for the info.
---
I can understand that, I hope they listen.
---
Now this is epic
---
I also would like some firecracker berries or whatever they are.
---
This is actually considered a felony since youre manipulating the economy. 
---
They have a perk to fix it, but I can't justify it currently in my build. Maybe try out rank 1 and see if that works?
---
There's only 2 ranks of bandolier.
---
Yeah that’s what we all want changed. To see the armor or re-name it
---
I'll take your entire stock
---
The treetops. I just saw it like 30 min ago
---
Yup yup, you have my upvote bud
---
I'm not sure what you mean. I have the paint yes.
---
oh nice i’m on xbox as well! i’ll send you an add rn.
---
It's a random selection every time you log on to a server. That's how people server hop to find weapon and armor plans.
---
You can paint ultracite? 
---
Idk I'm on right now.  I can check it out. 
---
Yes. Another waste of time in my inventory when I should be out there doing it.
---
Name checks out.
---
So not worry yourself my friend. There is a gun amnesty at abandoned bog town police station, just hand over any suspected duped guns, and your chems, to the gun amnesty volunteer.
---
[He looks familiar....](https://i.imgur.com/0sAVP6Z.jpg)
---
They are not shared. My friend sees different mods than I do 
---
Hell I’d take an * to
---
Identify ones I use
---
Yeah, but they haven't fixed plasma piles being unlootable yet
---
Sure, if that's what you do. The problem is I encou ter a lot of empty bases with turrets pointing at the back door. Idk if that top of the line trolling or what since the turrets steal kills in the back, plus they agro mobs out back. 
---
This confirmed?
---
If you use the codes on the net you don't need the code pieces. 
---
You'd have to be pretty pissed at someone to nuke them. Also, it's way too easy to avoid a nuke once you realize you are in the nuke blast zone. The only caveat would be if you are overencumbered and/or can't move your camp but them if it were me I would just switch servers.
---
The Assultron Head laser thing still takes all of your fusion cells in one shot, I learned that the hard way... Rip 1000 fusion cells :(
---
Does tattered dress have buffs?
---
There is a hunter's long coat, the mistress dooley facemask, and a cowboy hat. 
---
Good on you bro. Whitesprings and Charleston train station bases feel my wrath whenever im around. 
---
Call it the Expressway. Not sure if you own duped items? Having doubts if you're in fact a duper after all?
---
No worries! Come to the Expressway, we'll allow you to keep all of your items, your name and personality, and most importantly, all the fond memories of exploding things with your TSE weapons!
---
Leave all those haters and start a new life with us today!
---
But then you can throw nukes for a week with the same code?
---
I started Abbie's Bunker quests before finishing Top of the World, it just broke it up a bit - I like having multiple quests open so I can pick what to do. The illusion of choice ;)  Also I delayed that 'befriend a deathclaw' one for ages...
---
"LEGENDARY BUTTFUCKERS SPIKED POOL CUE"
---
Sorry couldnt help myself.
---
I used a Dragon around that level. Yolk like 8 or 9 shots (plain, no legendary)
---
Birch bark also scrapped as junk
---
They pay an amount to fight and minus the amount their level is from the total so like it evens out
---
I'd care if they deleted all duped items, it'd affect more innocent people than the dupers themselves, and affect innocent players more negetively than it would actual dupers.
---
Duping absolutly needs fixing ASAP, but not in such a way that will massively impact on innocent players.
---
Dont forget we're in this mess because Bethesda released a half finished broken game to us because short term profits were prioritised over investment in a working quality product. So lets not make appeals to bethesda to punish consumers for Bethesda's broken game. Bethesda should be held accountable for this, and they should fix this.
---
I've been having this problem with Feral Dogs lately - where they don't move, are alive but don't attack.  Then when you kill them, they stay standing like they are gonna go after you but are searchable and can be looted for items.
---
I know what it says, and im aware of those effects, but i think someone else pointed out (sorry i cant be too specific, i dont remember exactly) that each SPECIAL effects more than it necessarily tells you about. Im not saying youre wrong, Im just hoping you are, so some of the countless food and drug ive consumed isnt pointless haha
---
And if that is the case, thats mildly disappointing.
---
You mean like "Legendary scorched ghoul" that has no stars and drops no special loot?
---
Idk mYbe they left to sell off stuff or something. There isn't any point like you said otherwise. Kind of with you there. 
---
While I get what you're saying, if you won't want to accidently get a bounty at all, just turn on Pacifism mode. I normally run around with it on so my TSE doesn't get me an unwanted bounty on accident. I only ever turn it off to help a friend or lowbie with a griefer. 
---
I crash pretty much everytime theres more than 5 enemies on my screen and i get hit
---
Logged in after a week gone for holidays, crashed within 5 min in a vendor menu. (Ps4) 
---
Ty. If you’re on Xbox HMU I’ll give ya a tour
---
My my my have times changed. I too have noticed this. Probably cause when we were younger the net wasnt around so you didn't see all the whinging and entitlement. 
---
I thought replying to the OP but like some1 said- alt account- another great representation of who the OP really is and what we are dealing with.
---
If the OP had an ounce of self-belief they might not listen to others,  but themselves.  They might find that after installing the game they might enjoy it, like currently many are.
---
Reminds me of a kid not eating food because its 'icky' yet hasn't ever even tried it. 
---
It's just how VATS works tbh. It selects the thing closes to your cursor, since the game has no idea what you actually want to hit. Good suggestion though-
---
That’s a pretty good idea would you use the looking for group system to advertise?
---
I haven't been paying too much attention, but I disagree with removing "Wouldn't it be Nice." It is one of my favorite songs.
---
My first encounter with one was at the train repair yard just west of watoga station. It was smaller than expected..
---
level doesnt have much significance after level 50 since you stop aquiring SPECIAL stats. In a way we're all basically at level 50 and are farming for better weapons.
---
And I dont think youre expected to solo against three scorch beasts unless you spam everything you fucking got
---
Take perks that help ignore armor. Such as Tank Killer (I think that’s what it’s called). Get yourself different guns for different ammo. I’m not a shotgun build but I carry one for close up fights. 
---
Hey look at that we've already got bravo codes up. *Soooo uselesssss*.
---
That as well as making threads on here and market subreddits
---
&gt; **Display Shelves** and weapon hooks on walls for deco and storage.
---
&gt; **Power Armor workbench** should allow you to display a set of power armor (like in F4)
---
As nice as it would be to display weapons and armor I think there is a reason they don't do it.  Your camp is temporary.  It may not show up in any given session.  If you could place your power armor and weapons in your camp for display then we would instead be complaining that sometimes you can't get to them.  Maybe they could fix that by giving you the option to reconnect to another world if your camp location is occupied.  But there's no guarantee you will find one where your camp can be placed.
---
Proof that Santa Clause is in fact a duper after all. 
---
Thanks for sharing!
---
I would love to see how this turns out would there be stand to watch?
---
I've not tested it, so maybe? I've gone down the rabbit-hole that is misinformation on Reddit haha  
---
This seems to contradict what a lot of people believe, but I personally haven't tested it to see if it works. There are others though who have had similar issues with not damaging other players.  
---

---
This is why I inadvertently lost my level 50 ultracite power armor.  Completed a quest afterwards noticed an extra power armor chassis in my inventory &amp; dropped it.  Thought it was empty or just some crap.  Now I can't get it again.  How nice.
---
What did Fallout 76 do for new years?
---
I'll help. What's your psn?
---
This is the way that crits worked on FO4, but it is different in FO76.  Activating a critical will only use the critical if the attack hits, but it does not guarantee a hit.
---
Eliaspambicito 
---
Its done on purpose so we get Salty about it, go figure.
---
How many do you need?...
---
Thought this was r/outside for a minute.
---
I'm a big GB fan and currently listening to their GotY discussions (but haven't hit the FO76 stuff yet). Still, I was disappointed in their early coverage of the game. One of Jeff's first comments was that there was "no content". I get that a lot of people are bummed about the lack of (human) NPCs, but in my opinion, the story telling is nearly identical to FO4. If you didn't like 4, you won't like 76 and I get that. And YES, this game is buggy and broken beyond imagining. But Bethesda has always excelled in the environmental touches and storytelling and this game has all that in spades. And frankly, the voice acting on the holotapes seems better than I remember the VO from 4. Plus, removing the VO from the (always bland and sometimes laughable) character models has actually left me MORE invested in the stories in a weird way. Either way, the "no content" comment is just patently not true. You could argue that it is bland (I would disagree), that it is repetitive and cliche for Bethesda (can't argue there, but your mileage may vary) or that there are no impactful choices i.e. Megaton (and here I would actually have to completely agree), but in my opinion this games has just as much "content" as FO3, 4 or NV (though the *types* of content definitely differ between all of those).
---
When my friends ask how I could spend so much time playing it, I tell them "It's Fallout 4. But with people. If you want. And more bugs than just radroaches...."
---
What do you mean?
---
Why must it be?  Its not.. its been since beta.
---
Definitely and like 10 cap admission fees for anyone who wants to watch
---
yep just launched a nuke to the queen on xbox
---
good ol shotty sniper
---
As well as rules on stuff
---
Yeah, I'm chilling at the terminal in Charlie. That's the last time I use a site which claimed it had this week's codes, but just reposted the ones from last week. 
---
Now I'm just impatiently refreshing nukacrypt, crossing my fingers.
---
Okay that's fair enough. For what its worth that's the only time it's happened to me. It's entirely possible that it was just a bug
---
Would be a good way of making caps anyway I could help with the creation, like contributing to resource costs?
---
Encountered about 3 of those at treehouse village. The one legendary gave me a nice auto grenade launcher
---
I pick up everything I see. I’m really bad at that and my stash box is always full. I just make sure I throw out anything I don’t need eventually. 
---
Unfortunately that rifle is super weak end game. By "built for this weapon" I'll assume you probably use sneak bonuses and have semi auto perks. This means you can use the handmade, assault rifle, gauss rifle, laser sniper rifle, and combat rifle as well as others. These all are stronger, shoot faster, and can drop with nice legendary buffs. 
---
Since duping is still rampant, I'd recommend hitting the market sub and buying a weapon that could have 5x the damage of yours for 2k or less cap
---
Rip. If you by accidentally PLACE a higher level PA you can wait like 2 minutes for it to be deposited back into your inventory. I sold my ultracite and it took me 5 minutes to get the right one in my inventory since I’m under lvl 50
---
Seems like an odd sniper build to me. 
---
Either way, I use a handmade rifle to do sustained dps on them, and a shotgun to criple them. Hunting rifles are pretty useless on them imo. Too low dps and not enough damage on something with that large of a health pool. 
---
[This](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6f111ff&amp;d=lv2lt2li2l71lr2l40as2a72an2s70ar2au0e60pr2pp2pd2p02pl2sp0so0s60sd0sa0sb0ao0&amp;w=&amp;n=Sniper%20MKI) isn't my exact build right now. But The rifle and shotgun perks are being used. 
---
You have high level players on your server
---
Thatd be wonderful thanks man
---
add me il help
---
So you haven't bought the game but want to give your opinion about it with a long essay and you want others to read it? Get a life man, jesus the entitlement of some people makes me shamefull to be human.
---
Eliaspambicito is my Psn
---
What they do. Shoot you on site?
---
Wish you were on ps4 so i could give you stuff lol
---
You just need some of that stuff for the quest.  Without needing any quest object, you only actually need the final unencrypted key and a keycard.  You can even buy a keycard off the vendor without having to kill the cargobot.
---
And yes, it's the same code all week for each silo.
---
The real problem here has nothing to do with camp placement but rather the bounty system.
---
My gamer tag is my reddit minus the 03 I’ll be getting on when I get home.
---
It seems to happen much more often when in a trading menu. Not sure if the hotfix is related but it hasn’t done this before.
---
Get a shotgun instead of a sniper gun. 
---
[Noted](https://media.giphy.com/media/SmmseABwWSOgE/giphy-downsized-large.gif) - Bethesda (probably)
---
Your perks are a bit of a mess. Find your self a handmade and follow a commando build guide. Either that or sneak build. The hunting rifle could work with the right build but much better option out there. 
---
It depends on if there are mods on it or not tbh, and what the legendary effect is.  As the Nocturnal effect on armor means it'll be weaker in the day, but stronger at night
---
Get tank killer perk. Otherwise refine rifle man build.
---
You for sure need a new main.
---
I would look for a good lever action or guass for SB. 
---
If you are on Xbox my GT Voiceoftruth7, I can give you my old two shot lever action
---
You can always craft extra torsos to swap out
---
We both figured "jetpack" was important and held onto them.
---
Sorry if I ask...which vendor? :)
---
Get at least 3 more points into perception and get tank killer. Get an automatic combat rifle with good mods. Use vats with combat rifle and use all your crits, you should get at least 3 per 20 round clip. Kill scorchbeast in like 3 clips.
---
Or maybe just include everything in a game with the original purchase, instead of death by 1000 papercuts with microtransactions expanding into related purchases.
---
i'm not going to lie and say 76 is a better game than RD2 (though I am having a heck of a lot more fun with 76) , but RD2 has a terrible story. some awesome moments and characters sure, but the story is literally the same exact story on a loop for 5 chapters. go to camp, Dutch does something stupid, go to other camp and repeat. 
---
I was excited when the munitions factory got nuked as I’d never been up there after one had gone off. I didn’t see a single enemy. Not one
---
After all that he risked the bag disappearing by dropping it....
---
I don't have the time to do that because they take way too long.
---
three scorchbeasts at a time is extremely rough.  were you in power armor?
---
I think I killed my first one at ... 39ish?  the formula is pretty simple:
---
* wear power armor
---
* shoot the wings to ground it
---
* shoot in face until dead
---
If you're going the rifle route, I'd recommend farming up handmade rifle plans, those can output a very decent amount of damage.
---
Tormentor (luck, rifle shots cripple) and tank killer (per, rifle shots ignore 36% armor) are super important to up your dps.  Also consider bloody mess (luck, increase all damage done by 15%).
---
All in all, sniper builds are great for killing trash, but don't fire fast enough to down the boss.
---
Yea. Literally nothing is up there.
---
This may never see the light of day, but a sort by type would be nice. I'd like to see all my options for chest pieces before I junk the rest as an example. Same for weapons. There's a weight, value, etc , but no type. 
---
I saw one in the first week when I was still below 20. Down by Welch I think.
---
For online games isn't there always a disclaimer that the ESRB can't rate online interactions?
---
I don't care about being wanted, it's the thought. I  wreck there base and leave everytime.
---
Class Freak takes a few seconds to update when equipped
---
Try going back and forward to the Effects section a few times, you should see it change
---
Just saw the thread. Mamma D just took my heavy 3* combat auto Stim. It's bloody stupid that it can occur.
---
As spoiler free as i can make it, the vendor you unlocked when you gained access to the .. area that you learn about nuke codes in?  Or do you want spoilers.
---
And I bought a 2 shot exploding shotgun from a legit farmer.
---
YES. 
---
It is absolutely not in the OST.
---
A bug? In Fallout? Surely you're joking ;)
---
I recently broke up with my girl. She kept the cap off the toothpaste. You know who does that? A duper.
---
The common denominator is that we’re all playing 76 and getting disconnects, but apparently that is t enough evidence for these people.
---
That's nice of you. Lately everytime I see someone's camp somewhere, I drop a bunch of fusion cores and any duplicate recipes and stuff right in the center of their camp. I'm sure some people have been delightfully surprised to stumble upon my dropped junk
---
Not exactly.  Before I traded my way into a TSE/Godmelee loadout I would still regularly take on multiple scorchbeasts.  My suggestion would be to look into builds similar to your style, OP.  If that's sniper, you'll want to look at pipe and gauss rifles as there are no legend modifiers on the Hunting Rifle chassis.
---
With TSE and a good hammer a level 80 scorchbeast is no worse to me than a Yao Guai.  4-5 solid hits.  The trick was learning the methods to ground them.
---
That's the problem.
---
Even if bug is still there, just drop all your ammo but 1, fire it, then pick up ammo, works fine after that.
---
Was using one the other day.
---
I literally stopped reading whatever bullshit he is spouting when they stated they don't own or play the game. I luv these trash fire trolls...
---
It’s better when it’s nuked but you still get Legendaries when it’s not. It’s also good for farming stimpacks etc before going for another run at the silos/queen.
---
Also I play with around 8 different people all at different levels and whitesprings is where we hang out between doing other stuff.
---
You’re welcome to join us some time.
---
Top 10 bosses no gamer has EVER beaten.
---
True, but this a mechanic Bethesda has used before. I makes just as little real world sense as after making 10,000 iron daggers that I can now craft full sets of daedric armor. 
---
I admit that this is not the best solution, I was only trying to suggest a mechanic Bethesda has used before because I don't think they will implement learning plans through scrapping.  I'm just spitballing here and admitted the idea was weird. 
---
No joke I've wanted to make an A frame house as well!
---
while no legendary hunting rifles is definitely an oversight, unless you just like the hunting rifle for visuals, the pipe bolt action (in my opinion) is superior and DOES have legendary spawns. same accuracy, same damage, half the weight
---
Yea, the tattered dress grants a +1 perception buff.
---
Literally the only clothing in game I've found with any buffs. 
---
I believe you entirely, BUT, one exception, im level 40, and i don’t shoot ANYONE in the blast zone. And i don’t try to fight back if anyone is double my level. As its impossible.
---
I loved the Laser RCW, would be cool if they put that in too.
---
have the duplicated items been deleted yet though?
---
My tactic: 
---
* Gatling Gun (speedy receiver for dps, long barrel for range recommended) when in air
---
* Super Sledge (heated recommended) when on the ground, power attacking.
---
The drone of so many buzzing flies really adds to the ambience.
---
Excuse me, do not remove bubbles in my beer
---
You've always been able to build in a teammates camp. It's not a bug.
---
Shame. I have all these outfits that Id like to use but... A free special point. Can't pass it up. 
---
Yeah barring any outliers such as those.. not even sure if those would show any modified values based on effects if you're not wearing them.  I know for example mutant's doesn't show any modification until you equip it.
---
You always could build in a team mate's camp. It was a feature from the very start. The only requirement is to be in party.
---
Oh it's ok, thank you
---
Yeah cause that wouldn't be abused.  
---
Why not let us hack into the emergency uplink and broadcast?
---
it is repeatable every time you find another tech data folder.
---
Because you game doesn't mean you don't have a life. Going out of your way to post "I hate this thing I don't own or are part of" is some no life shit.
---
I think its on a c/d? But once you pick up another document you will know when to go cause you will get the quest for it again.
---
“William fucking wallace” and “im jacks raging bile duct” made my day!! Kudos to you for standing up to them!! At least someone did!
---
I continue to play and enjoy fo76 for the most part. There are some aspects that continue to piss me off, but one of the biggest issues was losing my camp every other time I logged in thanks to someone else stealing my spot. 
---
2. the\_realn3x

3. The issue i've run into is the power connector flip switch for powered security doors does not work. You have you jerry rig your own system in order to open the door once its closed. For example, most people want the keypad on the outside of a base for access inside, one inside the door closes behind you, perfect! however; the switch which one would think on the side of the door you now face (the power switch for on/off) would be able to be flipped, to open the door and let you out, and simply close behind you. But that's not the case. You have to currently jerry rig a switch that you can flip to disconnect power to the door, therefor opening the door, and then flipping the switch again to close the door behind you. A simple QOL update to either put a switch to let you out, or a keypad on both sides of the wall would fix this. Thanks!
---
pick up more technical data the quest will pop up again and you hand it in again
---
This is BS. Come on Bethesda. You are punishing the people that really care and love your game? If you can see their atomic store purchases, character, etc, you know that they have the game. Just fix it for them. ATTEMPT to save your reputation. smh. I hope this gets fixed for OP. People who care for  the game, getting screwed over. Not cool. 
---
You still find technical data.  When you do, the quest will appear to go turn it in in the same spot you did the first time.
---
royalty fees
---
Suggestion:. I would love to see an option to quickly save and swap perk card sets native to the game. I know there's a mod that allows it, but this is an essential necessity and could easily be built in a similar fashion to the game. 
---
Whats a duper? What do they do?
---
Yes. It's the same code for everyone on every server. That website exists as a crowd source. Players find the pieces and decipher the code as fast as possible and it gets uploaded to the site for everyone to use. The codes reset mondays. 
---
[Simple Brick Building](https://imgur.com/yqx3Ep6) camp. Simple and functional, but the brick looks nice. NOTE: Artillery is no longer up. The range was a lot shorter than I thought, and I could never get it to fire right.
---
Believe it or not amigo, I'm completely indifferent. I just wanted to share the images that would maybe bring a chuckle to folks, not be interrogated and basically accused of cheating. 
---
Heh. The mire equivalent of drop bears
---
Find more technical data.
---
Mine is an arm piece. It's a good find for me because I'm playing a sneaky sod. I've been sneaking around pretty nicely with it on. If only I had some night vision goggles to help me see in dark rooms without turning my light on.
---
Yeah they both do.. the damage and radius perks.  You can try some padded/dense armor mods.. it helps.
---
This is why I don't want to give up my camp location.  Sitting on a steel vein with 3 separate farm runs inside 10 caps of each other
---
Lol, every platform needs the lfg feature though.
---
How did you solve? I'm working on alpha right now have 6/8 pieces
---
I mean, honestly I've heard loads about people hating Red Dead Online though? I've heard glowing reviews of single player, but pretty much universally negative things about online. Which matches my experience with it.
---
That makes no sense in this context, not doing this doesn't harm me so thats a poor idiom to choose.
---
Camden park. This should be pinned lol. All the marine armour spawns there
---
Glow1: Wave2: Trimming power armor 5kgp
---
Thats personal opinion. If you dont like this dude opinion then i dont know why you would even comment on it.
---
Like going out of your way to comment on someones opinion.
---
I mininuke the everloving fuck out of every camp I see there and knock it off its foundation.
---
here's a example of how a good build makes even shit weapons work
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agR4xIfV6mI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agR4xIfV6mI)
---
Beach Boys probs wasn’t cheap.
---
Yea, I think it would be a good weapon lorewise for BOS as they would have been using Thompson Smgs during the resource wars as laser weapons weren't a primary use case so would have probably been scarcer, therefore the BOS soldiers who emerged could have modified their weapons to fire laser projectiles
---
And fix the bug where I can only place down 3.
---
Upvotes to the left 
---
A couple people including me posted but didn’t really get an answer but they should do something like that
---
As others have said - not a bug.
---
However if your friend stores said item then tries to build it without knowing the plans he/she may as well scrap it.
---
I also have marsupial so this could be way too fun
---
For a guaranteed Tech Data spawn (as long as you dont already have one in inventory):
---
In Enclave Bunker, in the war room downstairs with the big screen and rows and rows of desks just before you go back upstairs to Command. Walk along each row of desks until you notice Technical Data in one of them. It will always be in one of them. I collect one every morning in my vendor run
---
It's funny how people think they *won't* bring it back eventually. They will, because it's worth a lot of dosh to them.
---
Im unconventional, as in, not SO gritty with it, but id say im a raider. I hold onto alot of chems (even ones i dont use), want all the plans, and mainly keep to myself. I can be a hoarder too, which i think is in true raider fashion (i mean, i aint raidin if i aint keepin shit haha), just waiting for a little more leniency with the hoard haha
---
This is kinda blowing up so hopefully they see
---
There's a saying I can't quite remember in detail that goes something like, "If everyone around you is an asshole, maybe you're... something something..."
---
The starting first 20 or so levels are always so tedious.
---
It's not like i'm constantly going out attacking scorch beasts, but I would like to know that I can kill them when I need to. 
---
Can I use the Tank Killer perk with a sniper build? 
---
I guess I'll need to refine my perks... :\\
---
honestly i dont know,but its shouldnt be the bust plan because i dont own it =P  
---
Could it also not have a fucking delay when you target something. Im quick on the triggers so i'll often vats, then shoot but miss because it was a 0% chance 
---
Make it an event or something. I mean how is everything else not abused. there is a way to do it to make it not abused.
---
Sorry, I should be more clear, did you end up getting the keyword for bravo? And if so how?
---
pretty much me.
---
Yup! 
---
Thanks for the advice but at level 70 I got a bunch of ice machines and pocketed raider armor 
---
So the fact that I turned in 9 technical data and only got one reward was me just fucking up? I should only try and turn them in one at a time ? 
---
So you're rping a mole miner?
---
You will find that some of those songs royalties finished decades ago 
---
I just built mine here last night too! I’ll share as well. Such a great spot!
---
Last night two high levels were attacking my camp for no apparent reason.. It's on the road close to the bunker. Is this a bad place to put it or were they just messing around? I like my camp there so I can quickly check for x-01 mods everytime I recall/login. 
---
For me its carnivorous plants, like pitcher plants. Even if they're just aesthetic it'd be darn cool.
---
This week, as in post new years.  
---
Yes. And not all bulk weighs less.  
---
Hunters long coat + skull bandana + cowboy hat (atom shop) 
---
Power armour quest markers?
---
No they don't. I tested a gun with explosive bullets on a friend. It doesn't work. Then i tested the grenade launcher. Thag didn't work neighter. The damage from demolition worked on both but the range from grenadier didn't work on anything else then grenades.
---
yes.
---
Alot of the dailies are currently bugged and don't all refresh daily, only one or two of them does, and it's really frustrating
---
Recently they seem to land way more often for me. I use a shotgun with enforcer 2 try to cripple them, then smash their heads in with all rise when they land. Ive taken on 3 before without much issue (1 lv 80 and 2 lv 65s).
---
I could never do shit against them with rifles, they move too fast / erratic for me to hit them 
---
Only saw it once, and that was the first time i played after that patch. Must have played 50 more hours after that.
---
Basically same on my end, main is a endgame gunslinger build I made, alt is a endgame no power armor heavy guns (zarya) build. Both can nuke scorchbeasts like they are nothing using TSE and just regular legendaries.
---
doing god's work.
---
Agreed!
---
They also post it via social media, and this sub almost always has a front page post if maintenance is happening. 
---
I believe only lead, steel and something else weigh less when bulked. 
---
One item actually goes up a tiny bit in weight. 
---
However bulking uses plastic which will clear space in your stash. And bulked items can be sold at vendors ao it makes it easy to sell in a pinch at the train stations. 
---
If the old way still stands, only aluminum and lead truly give less weight per unit in bulk. It’s a little misleading, but bulking is mostly used to package and sell the junk you don’t want
---
My only thought is maybe they got a refund or charged back the amazon copy or something, invalidating their code.
---
This is very true. I only recently was brave enough to turn it off to put down some punk who told me my prices were too high, and then attacked me because of it. Lvl 8 vs a 34? Not much of a fight, but wasteland justice followed. 
---
You guys are all wrong, he said it MUST be a new glitch.
---
So it is. It MUST be.
---
Its awesome when your level 20, and a level 50 scorchbeast comes out of nowhere and rapes you. I checked the map and there wasnt any other player near me.
---
Mine has always been this way with the reduced ammo weight perk 
---
Haha they fix dupes? Yet my friends are dupin right now hmmm
---
To be fair, it wasn't clear you had tried this already and could have been a "doh" moment. I tried to help and was in rather a hurry. Not at all meant with any attitude.
---
Don't ever use the 'scrap all junk' option when doing this as it'll scrap the control boards/damaged control boards that you need to repair
---
I have a Plasma Flamer pistol. Once that character hits 48 I'll let you know.
---
It does state Flamer weapons, iirc, so I'm assuming any weapon with that type of attack will work. Doesn't not work with Molotovs, Pitchfork Flamer or Chainsaw Flamer.
---
EVERY FUCKING TIME :( Beth lemme pick it up
---
Those headsets that come with phones usually have incredibly bad speakers, if any at all. I wouldn't get your hopes up of having a good experience using it.
---
Everything should be re-nameable 
---
in FO4 i would put a "." in front of everything i wanted to keep together and it alphabetised  them together so i could always keep my armour sets together
---
I have pacifist mode on and I still got a bounty accidentally.  I was at a claimed workshop and there was a locked container in a wrecked bus.  It was not a player built container, it was part of the scenery - I've picked the lock on it before during other gaming sessions.  Well, picking the lock while it is in a claimed camp gave me a 10 cap bounty.  Sure enough someone hunted me down an hour or so later to collect those 10 caps.  I respawned nearby and he was kind enough to leave my dropped loot for me, so I was just happy to be rid of the stupid bounty.
---
Right? I'm looking at you, Rose.....
---
Yeah, PvP isn’t fun anymore when everyone has two shot explosive weapons. 
---
Yeah, I made the same mistake buddy. No matter how many I collect it only shows 1 in my inventory.
---
Just make legendary a different colour font like every other rpg
---
Hmm... I'll check it out. Thanks for the suggestions.
---
That excuse has only been in effect for roughly two weeks, you can't have been hearing it since release on November 19th.
---
You're frustrated, I'm frustrated, I get it. But you're essentially ignoring what they have done because there's so much left to do.
---
But small doesn't mean the effect it creates is small. Once my camp could stay put I could finally invest time into it. 
---
What you're asking for seems to amount to huge updates every week, that's not realistic. A lot of issues stem from small issues that build and amplify each other. Huge patches will be needed for stuff like balance over-hual because you can't implement parts of that in a vacuum and expect things to work. 
---
Well fuck 
---
The mound doesn't show up for me for toxic valley 3. I know im in the right spot, it's obvious, and I checked a video out to make sure I wasn't blind when I didn't get a prompt to dig. 
---
Yea but I was overencumbered, tried to get out but wasn’t able to do so cause I was stuck in some kind of - I don’t know what - things that I wasn’t able to see beacuse of darkness
---
I honestly agree. You can get attacked at train stations, so why not at camps if they are going for it being realistic in a raider like wasteland
---
&gt; shoot the wings to ground it
---
FWIW, not sure if that actually works. It seems random. 
---
I take, *all* of its limbs to 0 early in the fight, and it still flies around. It usually will land somewhere around 1/3 to 1/4 health and then just stay there. 
---
I prefer those liberator pamphlets myself.  I'm constantly grabbing those blasted things, and caring is sharing.
---
Oh man, I hate people who build there with just a maxed out budget on turrets. Kills the spawns so you don't get to kill them &amp; if you're using a gun there's a chance you'll hit their base.
---
Well I had 9 in my inventory but I only got rewards for one turn in. 
---
Interesting - was almost certain they did.. will have to have a second look then
---
I try every time. I go in through another entrance just so I don’t see it staring at me
---
Dont forget to scrap the wire connected to an appropriate turrent. If you directly scrap the turret, the wire indefinitely is stored in your budget and wont be removed until you remove your camp.
---
So you can't see how giving away thousands of pounds of duped stuff would at least contribute to a messed up marketplace?
---
They have a bottling video that shows it was plastic.
---
I tested grenadier on guns with explosive bullets and grenade launchers and the range was exactly the same. So it doesn't work.
---
My thoughts too. Oh there's plenty to add to the game....
---
Hot tip, the substation in Watoga is right next to a junk pile you can harvest
---
Whats that coat you're wearing? I want it.
---
 I was thinking of making a level 50 Hunting Rifle, glad I did not ;)
---
 My Lever Action hits a bit less, but way more often. I have a Gauss Rifle for sniping now. Just at level 50. 
---
 My other char killed a level 50 Scorchbeast at level 30.
---
Yes, you can. 
---
Feel free to look at my build for ideas about a sniper build. 
---
Keep in mind there are things I'll be changing, I.E. not investing in pistols *at all*, picking up a slightly different perk here or there. 
---
But the rifle and shotgun perks are pretty set in stone. 
---
You know theres more than one server, on more than one platform right???
---
okay, i just have like no space left in my stash. this game really isn’t friendly to hoarders. 
---
Nobody knows!!
---
Thanks a lot, this will help me find the firecaps for disease cures. 
---
Now, if someone can tell me where to find Swamp Plants... I assume they are in the Mire somewhere, but have never seen one.
---
That is a cool idea. Displayed shop stalls and all that that is already in the game introducing actual things being displayed. I like it. I do enjoy your logic. Thanks for thinking outside the box. So refreshing.
---
THIS!
---
Nukacrypt.com only has bravo at the moment , you should have waited till a few more hours
---
That sounds like something a duper would say.
---
The dupe was half ass patched again. It still works. there is now one more step you have to do to get it to work.
---
are there any code entries to try yet?
---
Yeah I got this I keep tryna place it forgetting about the bug aha
---
Hunters long coat. Get ready to sell a few of your organs to afford one though. 
---
(PS4 BTW)
---
There is no true market place in Fallout76... I wrote a post about that yesterday. There will be a true Marketplace when they added in it in a couple of weeks.
---
You have too many perks that are not combat orientated remember that you can swap those in and out when you need them (ie chemist and super duper only when you're crafting) 
---
For a sniper build you should be maximizing your vats crit as the goal with the build would be high alpha damage per shot so you want to make the best out of that.
---
That's for flappy gummed babbies.
---
If it's a floor, not a foundation piece, you might have to store/scrap all the pieces you placed before it first. The game gets picky if it feels like something will be left "unsupported".
---
tank killer works with all rifles, afaik.
---
and yeah, getting an extra 3 perception AND an extra 3 perks is going to be painful  :(
---
or, you can do what everyone else does and "apply supersledge to face", but you still have to get him grounded in the first place
---
Definitely happens. Out of 7 SBQ kills, only one has been instanced for me, everything else disappears before my eyes.
---
To hell with Rose.  First nuke I drop will be right on top of her.  Go be friends with a death claw....  $*!^ you Rose, @/$! You...
---
It was half ass patched again. It still works. There’s just one more step to it.
---
&gt;You are comparing their model to the model of those games? That is massively unfair because they are vastly different.
---
I reference those games as an example of how things can get worse from here you think one little set back is gonna turn them off from predatory mtx?
---
&gt;Why? Most of the bigger online games do it in order to supplement their development costs and basic operation. Guild Wars 2 does it to great success.
---
Fallout 76 is neither a ranked competitive esport like over watch, nor a **massive** multiplayer **role playing game** like guild wars, nor f2p like fortnite what reason does it have to utilize an expensive server/client architecture in the first place? Its all artificial rationalization to justify whaling tactics
---
&gt;but they haven't done that so that isn't really a relevant argument here.
---
&gt;They haven't, so that is again, irrelevant
---
They said the same thing about literal pay to win mechanics popping up in AAA games yet with the games I highlighted before it eventually happened. So do me a solid and humor this hypothetical scenario I promise not to hold your answer against you.
---
&gt;How is that much different than locking content behind a grind of any other type?
---
Most developers curb their grind to make sure the game is approachable to most users yet still rewarding. A whaler developer extends the grind to impractical levels for most users to incentivize buying shortcuts or even the ultimate rewards. Having real money in a game can have a well poisoning line this effect especially rpg and adventure games like fallout.
---
Small thing to note for the build you linked youd get more damage and more value out of your perk cards if you slotted a rank 1 expert rifleman (you don't have it at all) and a rank 2 of either rifleman/master rifleman (would get you 5% more non automatic rifle damage)
---
Yes, but its very time consuming
---
I did this a couple of times.. if you stand in a deep area you can spam DRINK to speed up the rads.. not ideal but if you insist on doing it in water it will at least speed it up for you
---
No only have one on you or it will eat them all and only give you rewards for one.  Believe me I’m really frustrated atm 
---
Just tried to make a camp yesterday. Same exact thing. So frustrating 
---
I'd argue EX PA is way more useful early on for the carry weight and ability to get a full set.  With so many high levels running around its tricky to get a full set at mid level without excessive server hopping.
---
You got quest objectives for that.... 
---
You got nukacrypt.com for the launch codes....
---
You got the terminal in the round table for the keycards...
---
Thank you for this cautionary tale. I hope it gets wide distribution and saves much disappointment. 
---
IMHO, badly needed for inventory control:
---
(1) The ability to rename weapons and armor items at any workbench, as from (patched) Fallout 4. (Selling/dropping named items can be coded to actually destroy that item and create a new, default-named item for dropping or sale/re-sale.)
---
(2) A "Do Not Scrap" toggle.
---
You can try.
---
I would very much like to place my CAMP near Whitespring where its still visible for oncoming strangers.
---
From a rest stop, to a defense tower, or a strip club; having a Public CAMP is my personal preference.
---
Placing my camp in the middle of nowhere in the map isnt really what I'd prefer with my preference.
---
HOWEVER, I do agree that the CAMPS shouldnt be placed at that specific area right behind those double doors.
---
Agreed , I am excited that they are gifting all the old titles to people who got 76. It will be very nostalgic playing them again 
---
If No one helps you by the time I get home I can help. Just patched all my weapons up and need to run a nuke myself. I'll be on in about 30 minutes give or take. What lvl are you? 
---
They have receipts directly from amazon on their game purchase
---
A super duper!
---
they haven't gotten a refund or charge back, and they've been playing the game nearly from official launch post beta.
---
I'm 80. basic weapons. 
---
The hell it's not. That's how I farmed all my mutations. Works every time. 
---
Yes and no you have to check the weights, I checked copper and 10 single pieces is the same as 1 bulk in weight, BUT the main thing is from what I found out, not all vendors will take the single scraped items (depending on the type) but all will take bulk items, and you will get more from that if you (can) sell the non-bulk stuff
---
yes, you cant stockpile them
---
[https://imgur.com/gallery/D9DUJHR](https://imgur.com/gallery/D9DUJHR) my little public place
---
You need tank killer. Or get you a two shot .50 cal. Thing shreds scorchbeasts.
---
Acid weighs more, 10 to bulk but give you 15. Never have to farm acid!
---
That's really all I'm trying to say. I don't care if it's in high traffic, just not when it gets in the way of others' progress. 
---
Because FO:76 is a hobby and this is a place to discuss something we love, coming in with an ALT account to post some trash fire post is annoying and a no life thing to do. The thread adds nothing to the moving forward of a game. Also there's nothing wrong with posting against an opinion that is not based on their own experience. Also seeing that you hardly post here other than to smarky kinda puts you in a no life position. Now go grow some more plants and keep up the good life in WV. 
---
A few friends and I do this once in a while but I learned to attach a power switch with a keypad to turn off the turrets when I go to sell.
---
possible yes practical no. You'll get parasites as well
---
Had a level 20 something place his there while I was in a team with some friends (I'm level 150 with lv 75 and 30). We're all fighting in the bottom where he swings and hits me a couple times in the brawl with the ghouls, his turrets start unloading on me not doing much of any damage but I don't do anything until he tries to fight my friends. Stomped him into the ground with my deathclaw gauntlet, he came back for revenge a few times so I orbital striked his house cause it was now annoying and doing some damage while my friends unloaded on his house so there was nothing left. Stole his junk for good measure and told him never to build his house there again. 
---
I have biometric card and nuclear  cards. just need help and guidance on how to do it. 
---
That is if you want the help?
---
Bethesda game design, yo.
---
Maybe I don't give a fuck. If you quit the game because a weapon is now properly balanced, then the game is better off without. 
---
The most Ive taken on by myself and not died is 4 at once. That was when I had no TSE, and I run a hybrid build (melee/rifle).
---
Knowing when to get under cover or behind a rock is life changing.
---
Im sure others here have given great tips.
---
Yup it’s making me feel they don’t know how to fix it
---
Patch was for silos fix
---
Haha Zarya build, love it.  My alt is a non-PA sniper but mostly still on the shelf even with main past lvl 225, just too much fun.
---
I have rank 3 of each, it's an old link that I didn't look at too closely. 
---
In fact, it's missing a few other things...guess it's older than I thought. 
---
Ooh I didn't think about that. Yeah I guess picking locks will still hurt you, and pacifism is turned off if you get a bounty I'm guessing. It should keep you from "stealing" from another player.
---
Figured as much
---
psa - game still entirely unbalanced and broken af
---
They attempted to patch the dupe glitch as well. You can’t do it the old way. You have to do another work around.
---
I try not to.click that shit
---
OP how did you get your game to be so dark? Did you mess with some files or is this a pre-patch photo? I've been looking to make the Mire dark and creepy again ever since beth brightened everything up.
---
Sorry for the unrelated comment. I'm just hoping there's a way.
---
God, if only. Me and my brother were just bitchin' about this last night. Either it's a deliberate choice they made since everyone always covers up their arms and the tattoos would be rendered pointless anywhere else, or they don't know that a large portion of people with tats have tattoos just about anywhere BUT the face. No telling with those guys. 😵
---
Number 7 being the lantern. Lite, glowing or even unlit and dirty. Few of these little bastards stand there ... mocking me .. I mean us. Looking just as smug as that little military circuit board &gt;:(.
---
I'm not so sure it needs a place to land; unless even that is super buggy. When we've been killing them, we aren't really moving. It just decides to land randomly then can't get back up. 
---
Who knows. 
---
Ditto. My running-around gear is tuned for utility rather than output. I use a pipe rifle so I can stack gunsmith and plumber, with a tesla cannon for backup due to nearly weightless ammo and great damage returns on groups. For something big, I'll hop into my T-60.
---
The big guns and heavy only really come out for the queen or other heavy-duty content. 
---
Or let us see what's on it.
---
You realize that nukacrypts team had to hard solve the code by manually entering hundreds of codes and using hundreds of keycards
---
Ive considered moving a camp close to one of those locations, would be awesome to see it launch off in your backyard lol
---
There's a fissure point just south of whitesprings and you can lead a scorchbeast across the map if you have enough patience.
---
do you know where exactly? i like grinding there
---
Put them in your stash, take 1 out, turn it in, repeat 
---
They did that to prevent people from making trap bases. It's stupid.
---
You can place farm fencing on the second floor if you remove the wall first underneath it; then you can put the wall back in place afterwards.  It conflicts with the wall, but the wall does not conflict with it.
---
"I can't get mom to buy it for me cause I bought too much fortnite lewt..."

Swamp plants? What is the ingredient and what for? 
---
My friend and I we're in a game when some lvl 12 guy messaged us wanting help. His team of 4, lvl 6 and below were being bullied by some lvl 66 guy. My friend (92) and myself (110) showed up at his WS and the 66 guy straight up left. Came back one time but didn't do anything. Was hilarious.
---
their accounts should be deleted/banned as well
---
they really hate that suggestion on beth forums
---
Not particularly. It took a team of several people to try hundreds of codes in order to find one that worked. Because they didn’t release the keyword
---
I didn't know you could agro them so far. That's interesting. 
---
I want to cast Rifftrax' twitch channel to my in-game tv

Bethesda
---
I have X-1, ultracite, T-60, and raider. I couldn't bring myself to get rid of any of them but something had to give so I gave up on collecting the remaining types. If I had my druthers I'd have every version in every variant paint job I could. 
---
God yes, I've got five chassis in my stash that I've no idea what is on each one.
---
Doesn't work with power armor, apparently.  Doesn't indicate that in the perk description.
---
Negative
---
Sooo very needed... also had a situation yesterday when I was putting the best gear I gather on one chassis of 6 I accumulated for storing said peices. 
---
When suddenly every piece of armour on all chassis disappeared.
---
Relogged and still gone. Needless to say all but 2 chassis were then salvaged.
---
Side note...
---
Lvl 71 soloing only and skipping quests for the most part. Haven't completed any story lines for power armour. I like exploring and gathering...
---
I am the OP. My mate reposted this since I'm using a throwaway reddit account. I didn't call my bank and tell them my purchasing it was fraudulent just so i could get money back. If I did that, I would of expected that I would of encountered this problem like a month ago.
---
Legendary bonuses on regular armor can be a good reason not to be in PA. 
---
Pics or it didnt happen. Seriously, i need pics... for science...
---
I can agree there is a bit of etiquette involved in the blast zones. I was referring to randomly in the world (or at workshops as OP mentioned)
---
Sell all but one to a vendor, deposit that one then return to the vendor for another. Only works if Technical Data is still shown as separate items in your inventory, once you get the quest to turn them in all of the Data in inventory will merge into one.
---
How about both?
---
It is part of the challenges for picking plants, I also have a recipe for swamp plant tufo.
---
Sad!
---
After 2 straight months of duping, fixing the dupe exploit now is not even closing the barn doors after the horse has bolted. It's closing the barn doors after the horse bolted, traveled across the country, settled down, led a full and happy life, and died of old age, surrounded by its family and friends. 
---
Also levels cap at 50 for all intents and purposes I think. If you crit headshot a level 150 with a black powder weapon I assume he dies like the rest 
---
Bethesda please for the love of christ fix the handmade rifle plans, the prices some twats are attempting to overcharge for is absolutely insane due to the bugged level cap
---
I read tital
---
now waht i do?
---
A paint like the wagota bots would be sick tbh!!!
---
I just wanna say the stash box thing where junk weighs 0 will literally NEVER happen. Every item in everyone’s stash box is loaded into the game at once. If you made those items weigh nothing, they’d still take up the same amount of server space. So it would crash the same way the “dupers” make happen.
---
Complete the brotherhood at least. It gives ultracite and if you don’t want it you can sell the full set for like 2k caps
---
I did close to all of the maps one evening and I would probably say this one in particular took like an hour and half. &gt;.&lt;
---
Yeah, my build uses solo perks so I rarely team with others.
---
I also want to know why this is....
---
Your post sounds like you wrote it as a research paper for Econ 102. As for your question "how else will guns be able to compete with melee hitting such high DPS?" How about the fact that melee has to be right next to the target, but guns can hit from significantly farther away? TSEs completely negate melee in PvP. I don't have solutions to propose, but it's way too easy to be overpowered in this game.
---
Arent the notes and mods instanced?
---
Ahhhhhh yea challenge plants are actually very few spawn points
---
I mean, the single action is back at least. 
---
I only have one set. XO1.
---
thats just me liking the enclave. they should totally add in a way to inspect to see whats on the frames though, i concur. 
---
Yeah I've worked the last 9 days in a row so have really just been farming. I think I have a buuuunch of holos I need to listen to and drop. Same with notes.
---
Not the same problem, but I suffered some similar buck-passing between Amazon and Bethesda re beta keys. Neither company appears to have any interest in checking the details of your case. They just blame each other and hope you go away.
---
More efficient to chug toxic goo if you go that route
---
Let me use a power fist in power armor and I'll give you stability out of power armor.
---
Right now, it's only fair.
---
doing blow, drinking some michelob ultra, playing golf is where it's at.
---
This was my thought as well, or he bought the key from a seller and not directly from Amazon. This is what tends to happen to grey market keys that are obtained illegitimately. I feel like we're not getting the full story here.
---
It also spawns you and other players differently so you wouldn't be able to get it perfect. With my current camp, I spawn directly in my camp box, however I've watched every other player (a lot of people through trading) spawn on the same spot, 20 is meters away 
---
There are a ton of outfits with the arms or legs showing so I don't see why Bethesda would render them pointless. And some of the most downloaded mods on Xbox and PC for Fallout 3,4, and NV are tattoo mods.
---
That looks strangly weak 
---
You champion, thanks for that.
---
Go to the Emmett Waste Disposal site.  Bunch of radiation barrels right next to a decon shower. Once you get one, log out and log back in and you'll be able to get a second, third, etc.
---
Do you have the Grounded mutation? Gauss rifle is an energy weapon.
---
Nothing was said about a perk being in use.

This for deciphering it.
---
This for already solved codes, right now just Bravo is.
---
So your gripe is really that turrets are "stealing" your kills, when they are doing their job defending the camp from being wrecked, and then it's justified for you to trash the camp. Got it. I say this as someone who once camped "near" Whitesprings, and had random high-level players show up and fucking annihilate my camp in less than 10 seconds for no reason at all. But I guess, I was somehow interfering with their farming legendaries so I deserved it.
---
And by "near" I was at the far south end of the course, just across the road from the statue, because there is a junk pile there. So probably nowhere even close to where you are talking about. Sounds like you and everyone else doing this just want to rationalize acting like assholes.
---
You're a god damned genius.
---
That being said, i wish I had seen this before I finished my house.  Guess im tearin that bitch down and rebuilding.
---
I did on day 1, between the vault and Flatwoods... and not since.
---
I need to do it myself as well especially since my friend thought it was a good idea to let me pick up all the Holotapes in a quest since I could “sell” them. I was a low level at the time.
---
Here’s that attention you ordered
---
Sorry work full time and full time student. Can't play all the time. They only ran it for a day. Give it at least a week or two. 
---
Sounds like I need to juice my luck up when I do Whitesprings then. Thanks. 
---
&gt; what reason does it have to utilize an expensive server/client architecture in the first place?
---
24 people per server. And an unknown hundreds of thousands of instances running. Their server operating costs are fairly high, and mtx is used to cover operating costs long term. If they want to ensure the game's longevity, they need that cost covered.
---
&gt; They said the same thing about literal pay to win mechanics popping up in AAA games yet with the games I highlighted before it eventually happened.
---
Yeah, THEY did, but so far THIS game hasn't. They said they won't and I will believe them till proven otherwise.
---
&gt; So do me a solid and humor this hypothetical scenario I promise not to hold your answer against you.
---
No.
---
&gt; A whaler developer extends the grind to impractical levels for most users to incentivize buying shortcuts or even the ultimate rewards.
---
Which isn't the case here, so it is not really relevant at this time. Maybe in the future, Bethesda could turn down that path, but thus far that is not the case. So comparing this game to all the others here is not a fair argument to make.
---
Theres a spot in the north of Toxic Valley with access to both a junk and lead pile (im sure its lead.. that or steel) 
---
Cant remember exact location, but its slightly north of one of the farms up there, and south westerly of the crashed space station
---
so... this happened to me for a long time and its a carry over from the old power armor glitch (i was stuck in my armor for a good 2 to 3 weeks..lol). I fixed this by putting my armor back into my stash then pulling it out again and dropping it (not placing it). I won't lie, when this first happened it wouldn't let me place it and i thought my frame was glitched out but found that I had to actually drop it. After that it works fine now and haven't had problems since. 
---
Building at team camps, not new, definitely. The only thing you can't do is mess with stuff the camp owner has placed or things you placed in a previous session. 
---
Example: my brother and I are on a team. I build a hovel for myself at his camp. A couple IRL days later I join his team. Go back to his camp and want to move furniture at my hovel. The building I made now can't be moved or tampered with by me. Only my brother can mess with it. 
---
20+ maps done and probably only found like 3 power armor part plans and motion assisted servos for all of them. I think OP got quite a bit lucky with their digs.
---
okay. i turned a bunch of stuff into bulk, and some had +s next to the weight. i’m guessing + next to the weight means it weighs less? 
---
Add bloody mess (luck).
---
I hate to say this.  One of my best buds has been going on about RDR2 for a while after he and his housemate got it.  Well I wanna play the story but the griefing sounds awful.  Literal bandit PCs running around hogtying everything.
---
So I got 76 on PC a bit after that, and have been playing it a lot, sometimes when he's over.  He loved 1, 2, 3, and New Vegas, but wasn't big on 4.  But I can tell he enjoys watching 76.  He asks a lot about the lore, and pooh pooh's the atom shop plenty.  But when I'm doing fun stuff he gets into it.
---
I want to tell him to just get 76 for PS4 and I'll go get a copy &amp; join him.  But it's more satsfying to let it play out.  He has stopped talking about RDR2 in recent weeks and I expect him to be a wastelander by the end of this month.
---
Lol I wonder if it's just something about my account. We should trade our rifles to see if the damage goes up for you /s
---
It isn’t solved yet, just bravo.

This is for solved codes: https://nukacrypt.com/solved

Oh they're back up.

Talk about beating the dead horse in  [**u/Sabbathius**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Sabbathius/) post above....
---
Anything that gives you rads can mutate you. Some being measurably slower than others though.
---
That's always the first spot I check, always just gives me pods. They did spawn there before I finished that quest.
---
The only difference is that those NPCs had their own unique personalities, stories and missions where you end up caring about them like *mind implodes* other good single player games! WOW! Crazy right? 
---
Vs. An empty game filled with some other players you barrly run into and when you do it's a roll of the dice if they straight up ignore you, try to kill you, troll you, or in some awesome cases are genuinely nice people you might actually end up playing with.
---
This has been asked for now since the fucking beta. Like seriously, someone there has to have seen it by now. 
---
My camp location is not original it's probably been in youtube vids. But how I came about was completely organic. All i will say is it's a guranteed monster spawn which is good for easy xp / caps. 
---
I mean im sick of stuffing around in my inventory swapping out power armour when I could be out there exploring and fighting. Yes?
---
There's quite a lot of PA skins in game files, i'm most interested in Mothman and Pint-Sized Slasher.
---
No chance unfortunately. The atom store will be canceled 
---
Or (and this literally came to me in a dream) When you hiver over the power armor chassis in the pipboy it shows what parts are on them. Please. If not Bethesda, please someone make a mod.
---
They could add a limit and implement a filter system
---
Sweet, thank you!
---
Yeah the game repairs with Scrap, then uses mods, *then* uses bulk. wtf.
---
Also would your rather me to sell duped stuff? You do realize the Sub Reddit’s have been selling duped stuff since game launched. Most of the sellers have Multiple Reddit account they switch between and Sell questionable items under?
---
Mods get you banned. Whoops
---
What level are you? I'm level 75 so if your too much lower than me I'll help you!
---
(Been lower than me you'd have to fight things my level)
---
You have a link of datamined skins? 
---
I got myself a few atoms saved up just in case a awesome skin comes out.
---
Bend over then.
---
Thanks for the website. I will visit this quite often. And maybe later on you could add quest walkthroughs too!
---
I give away good free stuff all the time, and I don't dupe. I didn't realize people might think I do.
---
To the new owner of that 3* medic gatling gun, I promise it is legit. I just don't use those.
---
Which silo are you in?
---
Not sure why you're being downvoted.  You're speaking the truth.  I guess people just don't like to hear that their "fun" is ruining it for everyone else.

To add to this. Prepare for a shit ton of Anglers and Super mutants in that location.

Also claim workshops!
---
oh ya. Forgot 
---
Yeah, there's a lot of tricks that work that are \*really\* counter-intuitive. Basically, if you're stuck trying to get something to work the way you want it to: think of the dumbest idea you can come up with as "nah that would never work" and try it. Usually it involves removing pieces and having things temporarily suspended in midair while you slap other items in / underneath / around.
---
The worst is the dreaded *cannot remove because blah would become inaccessible*. There are not enough tables to flip &gt;.&lt;
---
TSE isn’t over powered. We dispelled the one shot kill TSE rumor earlier.
---
The onshore death in PVP pacifist mode was do a Damage Exploit. And I will link it in next comment.
---
That is usually how things go, they fixed the dupe glitch but people found another way so they have to fix that etc until you can't dupe anymore. 
---
It's not like they are sitting on a huge list of way to dupe and wait until someone finds a way to use a dupe glitch... 
---
You can't really be that stupid right? 
---
canceled?
---
I thought they were because I've been hopping all day and with every new server I've seen two to three x01 mods. If it's first come, first served then I would have thought that I'd see it sold out sometimes. 
---
You don’t want to write an essay do you?
---
I use assaultron so yea 
---
My brother uses a furious exploding Gauss and it hits for over 600. I think the Gauss also does the base damage but the charge shot does 1.5x damage
---
are we sure there are no legendary versions for it? I didn't think plasmas had legendaries until like a week ago when i randomly got one just because of how rarely they drop (as legendaries). 
---
Thanks for the heads up just got home.

---
Sure, because that's what I said. My particular gripe is building right next the back door of the club house with turrets facing ONE direction. I'm sorry some asshole shat on you base for no reason but that instance has nothing to do with what is being said right now. I'm sure you understood this and are just being stubborn. 
---
I think the event outright tells you to absolutely not let them get to the island. I did this with another player around lvl 40, we stood at a bottleneck near the shore and picked off the kings one at a time.
---
main screen turn on
---
Well you should find them them now. I killed two in Watago after the server rework.
---
Also look to the north in the toxic valley, theres a double deposit of lead and junk there. Also the one further north of that has water, just a little south of the space station.
---
The game is rated M.
---
I guess OP has been in contact with you and told you all of his information and also provided you with the receipts?
---
I like this! 
---
Charlie confirmed 
---
I also miss the good old days when developers let us add music to the game by just putting the music files into a specific folder. Some games even subdivided the folder into normal/rest/combat sections, so that you can choose different music for different situations, and could customize the feel of your game. Takes very little effort, and makes a huge difference.
---
Melee builds still are competitive in PvP against TSE Guns with the right build.
---
I gotcha, thank you. 
---
Came into thread expecting an exciting story of some swift justice being dealt..
---
left thread with the tale of OP getting some wood scraps.
---
Ive been bamboozled
---
Fine. Comming soon.
---
Btw just a tip at low levels I killed deathclawx and wendigos by finding rocks to jump up so they can't reach me, eventually they run away and hide but jump down, tag them again and jump back up
---
I think in wendigos cave I had to lead it back to a different cave "room" for a rock to jump on! Add me up PSN I'll be happy to help if your not too low level
---
I did it to farm legendary items for like 2 hours.  Ended up with 600 pounds of legendary items, and that was with weight full reductions.  Invited pretty much everybody on the server to come get free stuff until i wasn't overweight and repeated the process twice more.  
---
It worked great but i still feel like a dick because I did leave it unattended for a period of like 3 hours and every time people came to farm it themselves I'd kill everything first and get all the legendary items for myself (they wouldn't join my team so no items for them, and if i don't kill them fast nobody gets the exp because the missile turrets are too good).  Lots of angry emotes and i totally understand.  
---
If i do it again it will be with weaker turrets, and the base far enough away that it won't auto aggro them every time they spawn.  Or without turrets at all, because they really aren't really needed and just lead to waste.  That said, if you're trying to get better drops or use an unyielding build, the extra little bit of help from the turrets is convenient.  
---
If only I could figure out a way to tag them all before the turret killed them, then it wouldn't be wasteful...
---
There's more to this. Without us seeing receipts or knowing if you tried a refund this is all one side of a story with missing pieces. Also, it's funny this thread was up earlier with responses then taken down and is back up with another alt account. 
---
the loot table takes a few minutes to load sometimes
---
still being solved, just have to wait, or go over to bravo
---
That’s a good idea, I’ll do that in the future. Thanks for the advice! 
---
Can't give a link to most of them, since i deleted files, maybe will be able to get them tomorrow, still got a photo of Pint Sized Slasher arm/leg.
---
fallout tactics had some really cool weapons.. also where is my wattz 2000 laser rifle!!!

You can just throw a fucking paper sack on your camp floor, put two doors in the same frame, and hop around and duplicate all damn day. Easy. Do stimpacks and water and you got yourself unlimited exp. So nuoa colas and you got yourself caps. Look it up and enjoy.

been on 3 servers all the same

Same with weapons. Please, god, let me name weapons.

I have all 8 pieces but none of the key letters so it won't let me solve it. Do you know how to get the key letters? My codes are as follows:
---
A-7
---
B-8
---
I-7
---
M-4
---
O-7
---
Q-6
---
S-5
---
T-2
---
I do, but I also have class freak, so it's only reduced by 12%
---
That be sick and appreciated.
---
Umm no lol, why would I prefer you selling them if I'm against giving them away for free? How about drop them on the ground or don't accept them?
---
I don't trade in stuff that is commonly duped, and as such it is usually much harder to find what I'm looking for. Do I see duped stuff being sold? Yes, it's pretty obvious when it pops up.
---
one of your frames is bugged and may apear as one or as 2.
---
the only solution is identify the bugged one (you will notice when being the only one storing on you that you go from 0 PA to 2PA on the inv...) and then sell/scrap/drop it...
---
its only the chassis, nmot the pieces so just find another frame and you should be fine.
---
Hopefully its a high priority fix, and (again, hopefully) BGS posts a timeline.
---
Conspiracy isn’t the right word. I’m pretty sure the OP is as just trying to get it across that people are blowing things up and in many cases even lying to get clicks and profit off the controversy.
---
The author of the article has definitely not played this game for any reasonable extent of time to be writing articles about it. His lack of knowledge is extremely apparent and he obviously just trolled around Reddit looking for enough info to write an article that barely makes sense.
---
I’ll be on in a few hours if your willing to wait. Total chaos xxx
---
Stupidity is doing the same thing over and over expecting different results. The base dupe glitch is exactly the same. They tried to bandaid it again by trying to make it to where can’t exploit it instead of patching it. It’s not a new glitch lol.
---
I was in there 20 mins ago and it was fine, looks like it's just not loaded in for you. Possibly leaving and entering would fix it but idk if it would reset your silo progress.
---
We don't have the full story here definitely. This thread was up and responded to earlier and then was removed. This definitely reeks of "stirring the pot" so no reason to get so worked up. Mostly when you are not seeing A) A real reddit account posting, B) not seeing the other thousands of Amazon people complaining.
---
I’ve got it on good authority that Mayor McDonough is sitting on a stack of TSE Handmade Rifles and I’m gonna a blow this case wide open and expose him for the lying duper that he is.
---
It's probably a bug. Question is whether it only affects the pip-boy display, or the actual damage.
---
Shit nevermind, they just made this easier. You can setup your character to auto-dc Everytime they login now. So I can throw all my shit on the ground and dc immediately and repeat. Lol this game!
---
I will stop at nothing until I find it.
---
&gt; surrounded by its family and friends.

Surrounded by clones of the same old horse.

Or...and I know this sounds **CRAZY** even before I say it...what if Bethesda released the patch notes when server goes down, and let us know precisely what it was they have changed? Something that competent developers have been doing for literally decades without any problems.

Still looks got on guys

---
still doesn't work with grognaks axe however
---
I dont know. 
---
Must be not working for the Gauss because that is doing half damage. Strange.
---
no crits arent a guaranteed hit. when you crit, your next landed shot is a guaranteed crit. so even if you miss the crit shot, the next time the shot hits it will crit. don't be afraid to use them
---
There's a perk card for that.
---
I dont even need a working TV, just not that freaking white screen.. 
---
Boards?  Why boards?  Of all things.. that seems like the least useful thing to try to duplicate.  Wood is fucking everywhere.
---
Sorry but no. That excuse has been used since release I have comments with replies saying exactly that from back in November, first it was no fixes because Thanksgiving around the corner and then it was Christmas/new years. I dunno I haven't played in a couple weeks and it's amazing they still haven't fixed such basic stuff, maybe time to unsubscribe from this sub so I don't keep getting my hopes up Bethesda decided to give a shit when posts pop up on my feed.
---
Dang, my two mains are grognaks. That’s lame. 
---
crits don't work the same as fallout 4
---
Ah okay. That makes more sense
---
Well thats true lmao.. I did forget about the other extreme
---
Possibly but mutations are so much better.
---
What type of trouble are you having in nuke zones or with the queen in excavator lvl 45? I don't really see any difference in the amount of stimpacks I use between excavator lvl 45 and x-01 lvl 50. I fully understand the numerical defense/resistence numbers are better on the x-01, but it just doesn't seem to make an appreciable difference to me. The jetpack is literally the only thing I will miss if I go with excavator full time. (and maybe paint jobs) :P
---
Also, how you are you getting the additional 15 carry weight to 540? Strong Back Perk? Food?
---
15 Strength = 225 wt + 100 excavator + 100 shocks in both legs + 100 exc login bug = 525 ?
---
See I just want to point out the being u said the word I.
---
Pointing your opinions on the matters more then others. Look you might like what I say but some people don’t care about duping and the market. Some people want to feel Overpowered. Just like some people are against duping and think the market matters more then it does. There is no right wrong answer. I’m also glad the duping is running rampant right not as opposed to 4 years into the future. I would rather have the issue addresses and fixed permanently now.
---
Because the market will recover. It will recover faster then you think it will. 
---
hmm..
---
Sounds like they broke something.

No one relieved bottles before the video was posted. So you should be the one to check your time line. It was posted at the beginning of December which an email was sent to the owners that it was hitting final production. The video WAS part of the email to every owner. If the buyer didn't go and watch it when in that exact video which was sent to everyone showing that surprise, surprise it was plastic then it's their own damn fault. In fact I'd go as far as to say it's their fault for pre-ordering shit in the first place. Idk how many times people need to get burned before pre-ordering stops. 
---
There is a raider camp in the centre of the roller coaster. You will probably have to sever hop but lots of armour plans spawn there. Often just laying around. Sometimes in containers.
---
If this is a bug or something due to the maintenance. It's like FO76 PC beta all over again 🤣
---
There is still really good Melee PVPers out there with build that no issue with it.
---
as a 30 luck build i feel like it helps. definitely seems i get more 2-3* legendaries than my other 2 characters. i cannot verify for sure tho

Yeah, I dismantled the ultracite power armour I got as a reward because it just said "power armor chassis." I blame myself but this would have prevented my loss.
---
The problem with Duping is that people are doing it to make real world money.  If Bethesda say....notified Ebay that people selling items in FO76 was against ToS and sent C&amp;D to the cap farmer sites duping would drop, drastically
---
That's precisely why I got mine lol its so cool to see the damage get higher and higher lol
---
I am not an alt.  If you read the other messages instead of being accusing you'd know that I am posting for the user because their reddit account is less than 24 hours old.
---
It can be in PVP if it’s a Dragon,Gauss or Pump Shot Gun.
---
Anyone else having problems with nukes though?
---
What console are you on? 
---
Im at harpers ferry right now and he has the cabinets plan. If you get this message in time ill get it for you if youre on xbox.
---
and where are you getting your numbers from OP?
---
There are a lot of things that should be simple fixes with the tools they have.
---
"Subscribe move camp module subscribe i'm not sure where to move it or which way to face it subscribe module camp move it randomly until you can live with the results subscribe and like thanks"
---
I have all rifleman perks, all stealth perks, tank killer level 3 and if I’m using my anti armour the dragon I take a scorch beast out in 2 criticaLe, or around 4-5 non criticals.
---
My two shot crossbow takes a few more shots but still annihiliates them.
---
Do armour penetration seems key
---
But people farm and sell stuff for real world money in many of Video Games that doesn’t include duping.
---
From what I understand that is what he is doing right now.  He can't respond to this himself because reddit won't let him post until his account has been active for 24 hours
---
I found a pipe wrench there 3 times in a row. If you're wanting to do a plumber or mechanic build then this melee weapon would be a pick even if it isn't all that great. I've maxed out the mods for it though.  
---
I don't like the pump action shotgun unless it's as a backup high damage shot. It's base stats suck. I found it hard to find others to scrap to upgrade it for a long time.  
---
I've found through my first and 2nd char that having some sort of melee is very essential. 1hd just doesn't hit like 2hd. The Piercing or Stinging magazine helps with ignoring armor which almost very super mutant has.
---
I am taking a break, but hope to return if some more time passing improves the situation with bugs and connection stability.
---
Honestly, a sci-fi PVE looter shooter with crafting AND building is just about my perfect dream game. I hope Bethesda makes some good progress in the future.
---
Vanguard does seem to show it's propper values even when unequiped as it's based on hp, not the mutation status effect check, and inventory items by default can pull on your hp percents right away as they have to for a full major tab (aid)
---
You're replying up the wrong person, and they're probably not going to reply to you as they've not replied to me directly.
---
They know about the bug. It's probably going to be fixed on or around January 15th.
---
&gt; They tried to bandaid it again by trying to make it to where can’t exploit it instead of patching it.
---
Sometimes that is the best or even the only way to solve a problem. Programming 101. Not all problems can be fixed, but making them practically impossible is viable. Their attempts may not have been enough, but an actual fix may not be possible at all depending on the technical reason for why the duping is actually possible.
---
Me too, thanks
---
It's all because they are pandering to the circle jerk of hate to get dem easy views yo

Hope i did that right new to this exuse me.
---
Oh yeah, poor little indie studio Bethesda. If only they were a mega developer too!
---
I had to hard save almost every 10 minutes on the Xbox so when it did crash, I would not have to redo a lot of stuff.
---
https://www.enclavedb.net/nuke-codes
---
Against other players they could make a perk to reduce explosive damage so you don’t get one shot
---
Yeah, but SB's huff and puff a LOT harder then the big bad wolf XD
---
Because this was an unexpected hotfix to repair the nukes, its a given for them to sneak in extra code they have completed to fix other items. Many companies do not report their hotfix notes, and will advise what was changed on the next major patch notes
---
Even though duping is a serious problem with the game I can’t help but die laughing at the accuracy of this comment
---
I think my wife got replaced by a duper. What do I do?
---
That is what has been happening to me, too often.  Loot table was loaded and all the loot just zips right out of the box and you get nothing.
---
They need to fix it.  All loot from creature drops and searches should be instanced to the players that damaged it.
---
Cheap to craft
---
Woah
---
Theyre fine where theyre at.  Get up close and personal and youll see that the owner of the explosive weapon will stop shooting.
---
So a typical stealth/chameleon rifleman with high agility and perception?
---
I heard there is a cooldown on how many mutations you can pick up and that server hopping into a new server refreshes the cooldown timer.
---
Something along the lines of: make it so every 3rd bullet does explosive damage, great for automatic weapons, which do need a buff, so so for single shot weapons which are generally very powerful already.
---
Someone  mentioned you can get them at the white springs bunker as well.
---
Here's a sorted list of value/weight for chems I put together.  Maybe someone might want to see what to target when picking stuff up to sell later.  It won't paste correctly, but it's from least worth to highest worth(weight-wise):

Turn your headlamp on you can see a little bit around you, usually enough to find the path out.
---
Yea there is an internal time kind of thing that prevents you from keep getting mutation after the first one in the same session. 
---
I spent 20 minutes the other day closing those downstairs double-doors over and over again to block some guy’s missile turrets from firing right into the spawn. I got very little out of spamming the button for 20 minutes straight, except 20 minutes of giggling (and finally, uproarious laughter when the dude got mad enough to log out). 
---
No they use the crafting of boards to trigger the duplication of other items and I guess these guys discarded their boards afterwards 
---
Over by Death Claw Island heading South along the road that runs from the Dirtrack Workshop, there is a junk pile to set up on. It’s also next to the river. 
---
Plus a farm right to the west of the edge of the dirt track. 
---
The Dirtrack Workshop also has a junk pile, several ores,(aluminum and iron) and a fertilizer/phosphate vein. 
---
Workshop isn’t bad to hold down. I usually dealt with either monger or feral attacks. 
---
Easy to clear out with usually about 5- 6 scorch that can be one shorted with a hunting rifle. 
---
My apologies if i misremembered anything. 
---
My level 9 character hangs out a lot in that area. Bagged a Deathclaw that wandered up onto the mainland one day. 
---
One per session
---
If you stay on one server for 1 hour or 8 hours, you can only get 1 mutation. Need to switch
---
I'd aim up, spamming VATS, hoping to lock on and shoot the thing before it landed!! ....that'd be awesome if possible of course
