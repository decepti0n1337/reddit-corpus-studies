Same here, no idea the reason,  i mean speculating that fixing something means something else breaks......been trying to mod my gamma and DVG does exact same....ü§û hotfix

My god Lewisburg can be a goddamned nightmare sometimes, but it's so unpredictable. One day it's massuve hordes of level 40 super mutants killing me over and over and the next day it's 6 level 10 liberators for a total of 22 xp and 6 steel scraps.
---
My advice when making builds.
---

---
1) Choose your weapon type, then build around that. Sometimes weapon perks will take up slots needed to round off your build. For instance most power armor related perks are in Intelligence, so if you go Explosives Heavy Guns (auto grenade launcher, Fat Man, missiles) then you need 10 intelligence just for Demo Expert and Gunsmith, then only have 5 points for power armor related perks.
---
I‚Äôm doing heavy guns and PA, and I think my build will have a total of 12 int. 
---
2) Use this to plan your specials and perks, stick to it, and revisit it every few levels: 
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/ 
---
Also, don‚Äôt forget you can level a special then choose a perk card for a different special all in one level up.
---
3) I personally do NOT choose Power Patcher as a constant perk. In my experience I only have this equipped when repairing my PA, but even my lvl 25 excavator armor pieces lasted hours on my tank build without this. Mix this with Fix It Good for 200% repairs at cheap costs, again only when repairing PA.
---
4) You‚Äôll end up getting MOST of the Intelligence PA related perks, however many you want on when not crafting is up to you.
---
This is the best advice I can give without knowing your building experience, game knowledge, or play style. I‚Äôm also not the best to get advice from, but this is how I go about it most of the time.
---
‚ÄúSome issues‚Äù
---
What UI bug? Like the legendary is still there but just won‚Äôt show on screen?
---
Yeah I go there mainly for the aluminum.
---
I see this on and off. I see it more when I'm using explosive weapons.
---
Where do you get the code from?
---
This is so funny
---
I did finish one quest today. Froze for the third time so I shut it down. Enough is enough. I'll keep an eye out for the next update. Taking a break.
---
Yep, i don't even open those anymore.
---
Basement dweller right cheeerre
---
I like this idea - there was a similar post a while back about the idea of a trailer park, that could be claimed and set up like a small town.... allowing players to have smaller camps but much closer to each other. 
---
A nice way for clans and such to build communities
---
Have been like these for everyone some days and still like this, bethesda replied, they are working on it. It's happening for all Mods, mods for guns, for power armor..
---
We need a new park card called Old Bugs Stay Dead.
---
almost a thousand hours and i have only seen one radstorm
---
Oh Waiter?! A side of fava beans and a nice Chianti for this guy over here please...
---
i killed it in the cave today. No problems. You have to last hit it to get daily done btw
---
i saw some gnomes in a circle... prolly the most scared ive been in the game so far haha
---
That is hands down the funniest thing I've read in a while
---
I‚Äôm looking for a Furious Explosive Minigun. Or any AA, Furious, Bloodied HEAVY weapon, like the Minigun, MG42, Gatling Laser, etc.
---
Same here, whenever I run through WS and kill random un named charred ghouls they drop legendaries. I dont think I've gotten anything above a 1* from them. 
---
Ive been farming for maybe 2 months now and while its more legendaries for sure just not very good ones. Although I am appreciative that its easy caps. 
---
Anyway thats just my rng tho maybe others have better luck.
---
If ur rifleman, that is a super strong weapon
---
Should put the level for the handmade
---
Yay - I did my first and only nuke launch solo on the weekend. At level 100 I felt a bit like a 40 year old virgin so it was more than time to do it.
---
There‚Äôs this fancy system within the game itself where you can Block other players. You should try it out.
---
I have so much extra glass, this would actually make it a more valuable item. Maybe something like 10 glass 14 plastic
---
Ive gotten a syringer maybe 3-4 times now from 3* lvl 68 super mutants.
---
Feels bad here too lol
---
I just said I blocked them in the description.

The Deathclaws weak spot is on it's belly. However it is very hard to hit in Fallout 76 with the changes to V.A.T.S. If possible stay ranged and aim for it's legs. Once crippled you'll have a few minutes before it can walk qgain to do whatever you please. I recommend making sure it can't walk again. 
---
The other day a high level Deathclaw at whitesprings who was chasing another player one shot my low stamina sneak character.
---
Where are there blueprints in whitespring?
---
[removed]
---
The vendors
---
I'll second this.  I used to find decent legendaries every so often.  And now that I find legendaries all the time....  NONE of them are decent.  Out of the half doze times I've joined the sheepsquatch event, he's only dropped really shitty leather and wood armor...  like WTF??  If that's all I can find, I'm gona move on to a better game.  Or at least more rewarding/enjoyable

You probably mean 4k, but you wrote out 4m
---
A shame your not Xbox I have a small hoarders cache in my Stash box
---
I'm sorry, I'm gunna need a full breakdown of HOW you know these guys and WHAT happened, this is seeming just a bit ridiculous now.
---
No worries, only crushed my soul with false hope I'd have help finding the bloody things, that's all ;)
---
was this before or after Beth removed them from the game? they removed the ability to make hardened receivers as well, have to mod hunt.
---
Dont forget floors and roofs - it would be nice to be able to build glasshouses.
---
Couple it with planters and it would be perfect
---
This has happened to me too it's weird that they switch the stimpack to execute as square instead
---
Discussing ‚ÄúBethesda please‚Äù while having a ‚ÄúBethesda mods please.‚Äù But can we go deeper?
---
Yep.

---
You can nuke once for each silo every three hours, as I recall.  We've nuked one right after the other consecutively.
---
Could you make a tutorial?  I've tried to create 360 photos but have failed.
---
Yeah, I'll login later and let you know
---
"...  the focus of the CVAA is still very narrow. It only covers the part of the game where gamers can communicate with gamers."
---
So, yeah, UI... as it relates to Communications, which is the excuse used to apply these laws to games.
---
Need to take alot of the suggestions and make a poll see what majorities say
---
I don't know what plague walker is, so I'm going to say no I don't have it? I did not get diseased from the mole rat. Interesting about getting attacked because of them. I wasn't aware of that.
---
Where do you get coal tho
---
Plasma knocks them out!!
---
Breach and clear event gives almost the same amount if you have the executive keycard
---
I feel like this is asking to be a sitting duck. In a box.
---
Yeah that's what ppl are saying. I just finished #5 with over 80 protectrons and 1 bots on parade event and so far 0 legendaries labeled, none dropped checking every corpse. Putting it all in a spreadsheet I'll upload in a few hours.
---
Comrade Chubs is the only bear for me.
---
Welcome to reddit, guy. 
---
I'm just as tired of the "anyone tired of X" posts. 
---
#someta
---
Nope. Never use it. I always sell that to the vendors. I have noticed it works after switching weapons. Well, at times it does. I mainly notice it when I'm reloading my pump shotgun
---
That would make sense with furious. Last time I used it to help bring down Queenie it broke on her during the last stretch of the fight. 
---
The vampires has never done that except for once where I forgotten to full repair it. 
---
Hell it lasted the whole fight plus adds. 
---
But yeah that does make some sense hopefully someone can shred light on it.
---
I think they left it open to continue her quest.
---
I frequent r/DestinyTheGame, trust me you‚Äôll get used to it.
---
But that doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt try to clean this sub up. I agree wholeheartedly with OP
---
The trouble is that the difference won't be large. Assuming that it's a non-sneak body shot, the difference between it doubling explosive or not would typically be in the 10-15% range. If it's a sneak or head shot then the difference may be a lot smaller.
---
This was last week the final piece which was legs I got on Saturday
---
Put on pacifist mode. Or get off survival.
---
No meme content as a post is allowed. This is not limited to image macros.
---
It is alot of fun. Play it yourself. That simple.
---
So bassically we were minding our business having fun until we were randomly attacked and the guy were threatening us and talked trash. They paid people to even go to my camp so they can Join. So they believed I attached there camp and harrased then which is completely false. I think they maybe have the wrong calm but they‚Äôre still wanting to fight and whiny completely ignorant. They‚Äôre never stoping. They also said we sent spies even though we didn‚Äôt. I think they even sort of agreed that they know we didn‚Äôt do it but they‚Äôre doing it for the sake of PVP. (Were not even in survival!) they are just not leaving us alone. We‚Äôre also a small clan so of course they‚Äôre winning and just greifing our base and never leaving us alone.
---
Look up these people and delete mutual friends. Someone is helping them join on you.
---
No, not Passive mode.  Pacifist mode.
---
You won't get banned for having a duped item.
---
There is a small chance they can be duped. But mostly it is his mule character with everything that they sell.
---
If there were duplicates than it‚Äôs a problem. It could also just be a guy with his mule
---
"Unpopular opinion -- I actually *really like* this game!!11"
---
You're a few months too late.  This topic was posted as a totally original idea about 1,000 different times when the game came out.
---
I trust all my friends. All of them blocked them. They‚Äôre hiring people to join onto our profiles so they can join.
---
Ah, my bad. Too much static on reddit most days to see the worthwhile stuff.
---
Yes do explain more. 
---
In my experience go stealth and travel out to a remote location and plant your camp down. Don‚Äôt build just place it down. Or at the least build a cheap wood shack. That way it‚Äôs not a big deal if they smash. If you get unwanted visitors then you know they are 100% griefing and borderline cyberbullying. Then report them as such.  But by staying in stealth they can see you on the map meaning they cant follow you.  
---
If your on Xbox you can just go to their profiles and block them out completely as well. I assume PS4 has the same. No idea about PC
---
You can only join through a friend I‚Äôm pretty sure.
---
But they can‚Äôt hurt you or your camp if your in pacifist mode on adventure
---
Most likely this, great idea if you have a trustworthy buddy to help you have a mule to trade all your crap too for extra 800+ stash
---
Luck can help, but won‚Äôt help get a better legendary, just one in general. Honestly, most people (whether they knew or not) that have TSE got them from the dupping era of this game, unless they actually picked it off a body. I‚Äôm 157 and have never got one. Best I got was a lvl 25 explosive double barrel.

[](/celestiafrown)Well shit man, I dunno then. Hopefully it gets fixed soon.
---
I have one I'll sell you for 450 caps.
---
If you want it, PM me your GT and I'll send you a game invite.
---
Seems like a bug. First rule of survival. Always double tab.
---
Do you want lvl 20 or 30 armor?
---
Yes! The glass walls were my favorite from Fallout 4. Maybe I liked them too much...no privacy.

Well just be like me and begin an unhealthy obsession with one topic for months at a time.  Makes it easy to filter out the rest of the noise and concentrate on the one subject that you can't let go of to the detriment of being more productive or at least having more variety in what happens in your own headspace until you shake it and you're on to the next thing.
---
On second thought, you're good as-is.

Its communist propaganda!

sorry I missed this, I posted when I shut down the reactor and didnt check
---
You gotta shoot em in the head. 
---
Lol. No really hit em in the head. Or cripple their legs.
---
Where dc you get your specific information from? Or is it speculation from another game?
---
Did your entire team block them? Di anyone accept a friend request?
---
Ok the third star is faster fire rate which in my opinion isn‚Äôt that noticeable! A better one would be vats crits or something or even reduced weight!
---
How about the birdwatch with the light bottles?
---
What armor do you have equipped? It looks amazing.
---
Wheeling should definitely be there. The Suspension Bridge is so iconic. And they kind of put Wheeling Island in there albeit too far south. Maybe an expansion.
---
Yeah I got the helmet paint by scrapping a plain piece of combat arm
---
It‚Äôs exploitable on PC and totally awesome.
---
Whoa Poppop‚Äôs ripped af
---
These codes have expired. I will link the new ones once i solve them :)
---
Fallout 76 was a financial success, they have ESO, Elder Scrolls Legends, Fallout Shelter, Blades, all of which are either already profitable, or will be in the future. On the Publishing side they have Rage 2 and Youngblood up and coming, followed by Doom Eternal and Starfield on the horizon... Hell, Skyrim and Fallout 4 are still receiving ongoing support through the Creation Club, which if they WEREN'T profitable would have been abandoned years ago. Your pulling this asumption out of nothing and see to think everyone not only has the same conclusion, but is dumb if they don't
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I did. Then someone on a mic said watch out there a scumbag going around eating ppl
---
I just want the damn vendor, I have so many useless 3* legendaries
---
HAMBURGER PLEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASE
---
SAME!!!!!! AHA I HAVE ALL MY WEAPONS AND ARMOR REPAIRED AND READDYYY!
---
if they can show us a video of them whacking a normal robot and get a legendary loot out of it I‚Äôll believe it.
---
Bro, Poppop did courtesy ski patrol at Snowshoe until he was like 80!
---
Maybe animals just ash up and dust into the wind?
---
I‚Äôd love to see scorched animals at nuke sites petrify up for looting reasons.
---
I thought so yeah... did this with another dude. Thanks!
---
I hear ya man. I felt like I should have done this a long time ago. Lol
---
I have...so cute!
---
Nope. Literally no one else has suggested this. /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*

Aha same, I turned my xbox off because I was bored of playing for today and just wanted to watch videos. Like an hour later I remembered my good 3\* brock so I rushed to get all the metatrails ahah.
---
You are truly the worst bot.
---
I want to snag a better melee weapon before but I can make do. Can't wait to see how it'll go
---
Not on xbox
---
Join via recent players, pick anyone that hasn‚Äôt blocked them
---
This is an excellent idea
---
You can make a ghoul. Play a little harder with character creation. My character this morning is VERY ghoulish.
---
Thanks for the Silver, Mysterious donor!
---
There must be more. Hounding you for HOURS and paying people to stalk you? Obsessive.
---
yesss!!!
---
Good bot.
---
[](/celestiafrown)Sounds to me that it'll require more than one dude to do. All my 76 buddies are long gone, so... I'm pretty malaise about it honestly.
---
Nightmare fuel
---
Yup.
---
I hear ya lol. It was my last mission for the longest time and I never did anything about it.
---
I mean it says 2 50+ player can do it so a bet a high lvl wouldn't have much of a hard time doing it.
---
So much ammo, I'd be in commando heaven!
---
Do ultracite weapons do more damage? I know that the projectiles for lasers turn green but beyond the aesthetics.
---
In my experience it always happens when there is 2 different enemies. Let say Harpers Ferry. I can one shot any super mutants in sneak, as soon as one ghoul gets close to them, this bug starts. I always clear in any location one type of enemies, then the second one and it makes it bug free. Hope this helps
---
What if the BGS austin team has been locked in the office and playing their own version of fallout 76 but for real.
---
My issue was the repair the circuits lol. I ran to workbenches and fixed all 15 but it would only let me place 5 and then 3 then after the boys were gone I was able to place the rest.
---
Assemble your squads now! We are crawling this dungeons rear.
---
Big fan of this whole idea
---
Lol oh you! Thank you though!
---
Yeah. Might be a bug or just intended feature or lack their of.
---
The invulnerable camp update was postponed. I was griefed just yesterday while in pacifist in adventure. For not selling shotgun shells.
---
Umm no. I do know what you are talking about at white springs. This is not the case in watoga. I farm it religiously and as of the last patch that area isn‚Äôt spawning crap for legendaries, don‚Äôt believe me? Go run it 6 times and tell me how many normal named robots drop a legendary.
---
Yes we did block them. Like I said they either hired people or they had members join that we didn‚Äôt block yet.
---
It can be rough but if you have a good supply of stims you can do it.
---
As far as I know yes
---
Why change?
---
They thought we attacked them even though we didn‚Äôt.
---
Amazing. Everything you just said is wrong. 
---
Your camp is still open to attack, though the attacker will become wanted. If what OP says is true, they don't care. In fact, they want this to entice OP to initiate PvP by attacking the wanted player. 
---
If OP owns a single workshop on that server one of their teammates can take it and FORCE him to participate in PvP.  If this happens, they have free reign to wreck his camp without getting a bounty while he's considered hostile.
---
Ok, it's just you said 2 hours of constant WS so I thought that meant 2 hours there. I think that's just a super amount of bad luck to get no multi starred ghouls, it can only get better from here! If you're on ps4 you can always join me and we'll hunt them together.
---
[](/celestiahappy)Right on, I'll totally give it a shot at the very least. Worst case scenario I'll just have to be social for once. There's no way I'm missing out if there's cool rewards.
---
I normally drop them in front of new players/alt accounts or over at watoga
---
Might be a WIP quest? I don‚Äôt know, if it isn‚Äôt and you know, please tell me because that‚Äôs what I think it is.
---
And your putting it on the excavator? I heard someone talking about it let them put it on the arm of another set is why I ask.
---
Put your GT's as hidden/invisible in the Xbox menu
---
I have had that happen before a few times (has always been ghouls for some reason though) but since two of the most upvoted comments in this thread are saying it I figure a solid dataset will let us know which way one or the other.  Although I can say I'm on #9 now and it is definitely not looking good for the "bad RNG" and "UI bug" crowds.
---
Well, it should be there, do you have any buddies who play who could keep an eye out for you? Or maybe you could post in a trading sub to see if anyone can find it on your platform.
---
I have a non legendary plasma rifle with a flame barrel and I think gamma.  It rips through ghouls like a hot knife through butter.  Downside is it eats through amma and you have to constantly repair.
---
Lolz, challys a bull not a cow.. that wasn‚Äôt milk you expressed..
---
yeah , bethesda dont give a shit about any of us , there not going to change something just because someone made a post that got 50 upvotes.
---
That‚Äôs a no go on friends I‚Äôm the only one who I know that likes fo76 and I have been posting to different forums for a day or two with no responses which is a BIG RIP
---
Oh excavator ..  I assumed it went on raider power armor .. my bad thanks then .. I don't have excavator, prolly shouldn't read the fine print
---
I‚Äôm so glad it wasn‚Äôt just me that‚Äôs done this.
---
You got proof you didn't? Or even proof any of this is actually happening?
---
Last week i was, now I am not. Honestly feel this is going to be a good amount of time and items spent just to get a 2 star switchblade. The past 2 events have been a joke so have real low expectations for all future content.
---
I need this now haha
---
Lewisburg, roof-top garden northwest corner across from the church.  It was laying down in the dirt.
---
Sounds like you need a visit from Liberty Prime, you commie!
---
were?
---
the same way, just takes way longer!
---
Why didn‚Äôt they just make the already-existing and UI matching news banner they already had clickable?
---
I just use a friend as a server anchor, put a bunch of stuff in a container near a trainstation, swotch to alt, join friends server again then loot the items. I've never lost anything this way and transferred hundreds of items.
---
Shotgun + enforcer perk. Cripple them then kill them at your leisure.
---
Kill, Laugh, Love :)
---
I don‚Äôt have proof but neither does the clan. They never said a specific but they said I did something 3 weeks ago but I‚Äôm pretty sure I was starting my clan during that time.
---
Probably 20
---
Also the resort mirror still clips INTO the wall :(
---
What‚Äôs your build?
---
They are legendary mobs but the *diseased* prefix overwrites the legendary one.
---
Also, even if it's duped they won't take it from you unless you have 2 identical items, atleast that's how the last item purge worked.
---
Removing world hopping to reset spawns was a huge and undeniable nerf to legendary spawns but could arguably be seen as ending an exploit. It was a very easy way to reliably spawn lucrative legendaries.
---
So...they waited 3 weeks, then decide to launch a hours long, absolutely insane attack on you? No. One guy maybe, but a whole group coordinating like this just to mess with you over something so small you claim? I am not buying it.
---
I've noticed that as well. Some diseased don't drop legendaries though so it's hit or miss for me.
---
Right, I'd probably start in Point Pleasant, grab some Mothman eggs to make omelette to sell and also to boost your charisma, then farm enemies for weapons somewhere and sell those. Or if you can craft something for cheap that works too. Another source is some of the single sellable junk items, ultracite in particular which you can get from SBs down in the bog.
---
Sorry? It's multiplayer for a reason. But no, there are still plenty of things to solo. Also, legendary spawns weren't nerfed, no proof.
---
They said you can solo it you just gotta be strong enough or just spam stims
---
Like what?
---
I thought that at first too! But there‚Äôs a bit of a story line along the main quest line that explains how the petrified corpses are just the ‚Äòfinal form‚Äô of some of the scorched- also explains why you find scorched humans frozen in a weird position before they ‚Äòcome to life‚Äô :)
---
It will be.  Someone somewhere will find a way. 
---
It‚Äôll be no different than the dungeons in WoW. Play solo and team up when needed.
---
It was either him or you
---
Premature explodulation.
---
I'll take it if no one else has
---
Why not just post the extras you have here, I can't  guarantee they aren't trying to resell them but atleast someone will actually get them. Unless that just seems like too much effort which I'd understand.
---
Quests? Hard caves/Areas? Literally the rest of the game.
---
I'm sure itll be a good addition, plus, as long as it doesnt have a timer, you have the beautiful reddit community to team up with and take whatever is DOWN
---
Move your camp and block the mutual friends. Won‚Äôt be a problem. Workshops are hardly worth capturing. Especially if he has this problem
---
Come get it!
---
Bethesda please stop these posts
---
I also noticed two things:  
---
1.  The gun frequently misses vats shots that say 95 percent.
---
2.  The gun has a high damage listing but is out damaged in reality by my piercing 50 cal sniper.  The latter one shots most things in the head
---
It's left open because they plan to add to it I've read many times on here atleast.
---
This is amazing
---
That will stop the targeted harrassment, but won't change the possibility of others doing it.  It's also a complete non-sequitur to your previous post and my reply.
---
You should have called a doctor about 4 hours ago if they do.
---
Most armor you learn the same way.
---
However high end gear, like Combat Armor and Marine Armor, you have to find/buy the mods for
---
I could care less if they are selling duped stuff. I'll buy it all day long lol. Seems to be the only way to have good stuff in this game. Everything I use was bought through Reddit. Nothing I've been dropped is worth a damn.
---
can confirm its bugged for me as well, made a bethesda forum post of the issue
---
 [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/336136/cant-use-my-lever-action-rifle-skin-on-sole-survivor-but-it-s-a-lever-action-rifle/2](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/336136/cant-use-my-lever-action-rifle-skin-on-sole-survivor-but-it-s-a-lever-action-rifle/2)
---
I'm ready for it.  Power armor repaired, ammo crafted, TS .50 cal fully repaired, and all the perks I need.  I've got a quad explosive combat shotgun ready if I need to get really nasty.
---
There are lots of player created factions that have wars in PvP. But I understand these are not really what you mean.
---
It depends on who shows up- what level they are  and what weapons they bring.  My team and I primarily use explosive weapons.  I have a ** zealots gatling laser with exploding bullets (it was a queen drop).  I also have an instigating gatling laser I use (non exploding) and two 50 calibur guns (one two shot and one furious).  Another team mate is melee and they help keep the enemies off of us while We pelt the queen.  It's best to aim at the head when it lands.  Also we use orbital strike beacons when it lands.  Those are fairly expensive to make but useful.  Usually there needs to be about 8 players.
---
Quests?....... I'm a level 230 character. There are no quests.
---
Caves/Areas?......they killed legendary spawn rates and the enemies spawn in the exact same spot every time. I can roll West Tek with my eyes closed. Why would I roll it over and over with no reward?
---
You have to be fucking joking fallout 76 was not a financial success and if you read articles the only game that is currently profitable is ESO the rest are average to above average there only real source of revenue is  ESO, Wolfenstein, Fallout Shelter,Rage and some of the fallout games
---
Thx dude..I've become a big fan of going to particular areas..clearing them out..and selling everything the enemies drop..I was limited before because of the different factions..where if I did this..I would be wasting a ton of caps on fast traveling
---
My honest opinion? No.
---
then there would be no content on the sub except bug reports
---
Well known issue, hopefully fixed soon
---
Who cares if someone else random does it. It‚Äôs not targeted. It‚Äôs part of the game quit crying. The only thing I can see being a problem is being targeted.
---
How the fuck can you prove you never attacked someone....
---
legendary spawns were nerfed, theres proof
---
Gotcha, didn't know it was wide spread. I'll pull this post in a few, thank you!
---
Oh, we stopped getting spawn resets on re-entry during nukes since a patch or two ago. Interesting that it‚Äôs still working for you. What, but you haven‚Äôt tested during nukes or it only works outside nukes?
---
I sent in a ticket and they are aware of the issue
---
Has anyone completed it? I was surprised to find a holotape I had been missing when I went to Mountainside B&amp;B, wonder if I find all of them will it complete?
---
Again, no proof they "killed" spawn rates. So, okay. As a solo... Play something else. Congrats, you did everything. No game is infinite. Not every update to this multiplayer game should cater to you. Or attempt to solo burrows?
---
Stack -8% player damage with Sentinel/Cavalier then slap on a weapon and your good to go, build perk cards around your weapon and movement or lack or depending on sent/cava.
---
Yeh. sorry
---
I‚Äôm being serious! They did! And those were my exact thoughts I thought of too!
---
Just run melee, it‚Äôs insanely broken.
---
Only if they don't cost the same to repair from 1% as they do from 99%...
---
I had a similar problem.  
---
When I would use the launcher to install, it would create another copyof the game and it would still not work.  After the third time I uninstalled 76 and the Bethesda launcher, reinstalled, and it's been fine.
---
You can also drink Brahmin milk.
---
Good luck to you, true or not. There is something here we simply don't know, whether you are hiding it or not.
---
Also I hope you realize. The thing with your workshop making your camp vulnerable is still going to be a thing after they take away damage while in pacifist. Because it‚Äôll still be initiating pvp
---
Assaultron head is a weapon.
---
Awe, he's cute
---
Thanks!
---
nah but I have no copper because of last night
---
Gt Travis party181
---
Entirely welcome!
---
It's frustrating but yeah I'd just move your camp. I imagine they are coming to your base specifically because they have it's location.
---
Ain't that church haunted or something.
---
Assaultron helmet or Scavanged Assultron Head?  
---
  
---
The head is a weapon.
---
Cool cool. My gt is micr0s0ftsucks2. Just meet up when the servers go live?
---
Awesome one more ticket for them to read, hopefully gets hotfixed during patch time tomorrow :)
---
Could be worse. Could be me farming stimpak in survival during this event.
---
You haven't been to Watoga at all this week?
---
Not only did they kill legendary Protectron spawns but the legendary that used to spawn in the Civic center rarely spawns as a legendary anymore and the spawn rate in the municipal center is noticeably lower. I've got 700 hours in the game...... trust me......they reduced the spawn rate.
---
Tormentor and One-Gun Army have similar effects if you're using rifles or heavy weapons, respectively. Both are in the Luck column.
---
What the Bethesda commenting on my post I just post random dumb stuff what is going on here.
---
If you would have just read the terminal before starting the event you would know how to do it...
---
For Watoga, i hope so.
---
Cool, I might have one or two more people in the group not entirely sure.
---
Yea this happens to me I don‚Äôt use a single stomps I on the queen then I‚Äôm using like 20 for the squatch
---
Lmao I thought it was for raider as well! Then my friend got it and joined my team. Then I noticed it was excavator and went and bought it from the atom shop!
---
Nice
---
Bethesda have said it was a financial success, it has an active player base and is continuing to get support, so I say again. WHERE. IS. YOUR. PROOF. OF. BANKRUPTCY
---
Thank you...
---
But WoW has an automated LFG tool and \*\*\_\_Text chat\_\_\*\* I can use to find groups.
---
Sounds good with me üëç
---
I'm pretty sure it's a helmet like the one that the imposter wears.
---
One day we can get something similar to that. Hell there probably something coming with the patch as well.
---
Yep.   
---
I would love to see some actual growth or the wasteland change. It's way to static as is.   
---
NPCs (ghouls included) would be pretty much mandatory for that to happen though. Hopefully the wastelanders expansion adds them back in.
---
I‚Äôve done exactly the same thing. I felt so horrible but it was so funny too haha
---
I've nuked about 4 times.  Charleston, Morgantown, top of the world and ws.  I prefer Morgantown, cobalt flux dream, plus robots and scorched drop high rad fluids, ionized and hardened mass.
---
Oh my god I forgot about the vendor, I‚Äôve been selling every legendary I get (if it‚Äôs shit of course) instead of storing them on a mule
---
Watoga is your proof that they can adjust the rate. If they changed the spawn rate from 10% to 5% that's a reduced rate. You may not notice it but players with 700 hours in the game can see the difference.
---
yes cuz companies cant lie sure there increasing in player base paying 50 dollars for one time could make a medium to large impact but people are not buying any atoms and trying to earn them instead fucking idiot
---
I feel like I saw this same thread a few weeks ago, right down to the stair glitch picture. Talk about deja vu...
---
Again. Proof. Post it.
---
Well, now don't forget about that Dross Toss mission next!
---
I'd be okay with it if they had an LFG and I don't have to mic up with a squad just to finish it. But I seriously doubt Bethesda is capable of implementing an in game LFG.
---
runs ok for me but i'm on oneX
---
I think it's the helmet. I believe the additional vendor in Whitesprings next to the robot who sells armor sells it. I believe that robot is the BOS representative.
---
 This isn't directly going to make them bankrupt but it is certainly a snowball rolling down a hill and getting bigger.  
---
Bethesda is all profit-oriented now. The way this will hurt them is the fact that they are extremely arrogant and too self-absorbed to notice when and if they go too far and release a cash grab turd. They think they do no wrong, and they think their work is the best in the world (its lower than mediocre). Like how they've barely admitted anything is wrong with 76.  
---
When Garfield, er, *Starfield* comes out it will be painfully obvious that gamebryo is a steaming pile of s\*\*\* and a cash grab, and they won't be able to rely on any fanbase to make it seem like the "emperors new clothes" - the industry will s\*\*\* on that game and Starfield will hurt them quite a bit. No one asked for it, like 76. It will be pure gamebryo without the brand names people want, and the flaws will be glaring.  
---
It's exactly like GAMEFREAK and how many games they make outside of pokemon are irrelevant. They've used the same s\*\*\*ty gamebryo engine and gameplay across seven games, they're a one trick pony only they don't have the pokemon fanbase.  
---
TLDR this game merely displays Bethesdas mediocrity, STARFIELD, if anything, will be the beginning of the end.
---
Nice, hopefully they fix it soon because as you said there in your post, you (we) paid for the skin and cannot use it. I bought the skin to specifically put on that weapon. I have put it on a level 25 lever action and it is a really nice skin so that makes it even worse lol.
---
At Fort Defiance, from the metal doors: 2nd room on the left has an ammo bag on the bed. Stumbled on it while following your guide.
---
And only pick it up in Train Stations
---
Thanks for the heads up, I‚Äôm using the One S, that might be the issue.
---
Unyielding bloodied builds are the highest damage I've seen, and use. Pair that with melee to hit over 1000 damage. You just need to hit them first. Serendipity perk helps.
---
Which ones did you get? I think they are supposed to be on floor decor section.
---
Only during the Lying Lowe quest line in the back of the beater car.
---
EWWWWWWWWWWW
---
Another weird thing; on the [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) launcher I get an error message whenever I try to click on "Mods" or "Account Management" in the top left corner drop down menu. It says "Error opening link. Please check network connection and try again."
---
This makes me think there's something wrong with [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) and my connection related to it. I can't access it through the launcher or its servers through the game. I tried reinstalling the launcher but it didn't work.
---
Similar, but different...
---
* Patch Day
---
* Start Lying Lowe and the side quests.
---
* Get through the clues of the first quest; Event: Cryptid appears
---
* everyone goes there
---
* no one knows what to do and get by zerging it and spamming E on anything that gets the quest-objective marker.
---
* ponder the meaning of life
---
* hide on top of a shack
---
* die
---
* respawn
---
* die, eyebombs
---
* respawn, another player has taken your loot
---
* pew pew a disturbing sheepatron.
---
* Die, this time from random fire/energy damage across the *entire fucking area*.
---
* Jump to the shack, die from explosions, corpse goes flying into the cranberry bog.
---
* Event Completed:  White Wolf Fedora
---
* spends more than 30 seconds to find corpse; it disappears.
---
* Hear another player ask "Did I just miss my quest?"
---
* Hear another player ask "DoEs AnYoNe WaNt A fEdoRa?"
---
* Hear another player as they finally load in all hyped trying to find bots to kill; none of the corpses/piles had loaded yet.
---
* Fast Travel
---
**0.8 hours later**
---
* Finish off the sleuthing quests
---
* Get to pylon site
---
* Expect grand finale event to trigger
---
* *crickets*
---
* Continue trying the terminal at the pylon site; "pLeAsE wAiT uNtIl LaTeR"
---
* Google up "recall assaultron keycard", get FO4 circuit board results.
---
* Go to Lowe's Taxidermy
---
* Look high and low in every nook and cranny for a circuitboard.
---
* Give up.
---
* Launch Nuke.
---
**next day**
---
* Go to whitespring.
---
* See ~2000 cap thing that isn't a plan.
---
* Buy one anyway; craft it.
---
* See "recall keycard (2)" in inventory
---
* Kick self in shins
---
* Back at the terminal; "pLeAsE wAiT uNtIl LaTeR"
---
* Give up
---
* Event: Cryptid
---
* "Oh fuck this 3 hour cooldown shit".
---
* Die x3, eyebombs
---
* Die x2, random fire/energy damage with no apparent source.
---
* Die x2, swarm of gutsies that people decided to ignore because "OMG A 3STAR TAG IT TAG IT TAG IT TAG IT"
---
* Die, trying to get through gutsies to switch on a pylon.
---
* Give up on conduit duty for life if idiots insist on not helping with adds.
---
* Find sheepsquatch corpse:  Legendary Rolling Pin
---
* *uninstalls*.
---
Where is the car?
---
Plague walker is a mutation, where the diseases you have will kinda create a cloud of localized area effect damage. Handy for tiny annoying creatures.
---
Where I find lead:
---
- 80+ in the silo gyms. 100+ if I run the silo. 
---
- About 20 or so tin cans behind the Buck's Den Beer Hall, along with other scrap. 
---
- The obvious motel, fire station, jail, etc. 
---
- Breach and Clear
---
- r/Market76.
---
It's just tripping bro. When it gets into a fight, it'll go ham on you. :( Poor diabolos, I had to put him down.
---
I didn't know you could use the cannibal perk on other players. Well looks like "survival" mode might be more interesting than I thought.
---
I was thinking the same thing
---
If you played the quest you would know, otherwise go initiate the quest from any sheepsquatch poster found at every train station.
---
&gt; Downvoting info in order to spread misinformation and hatred
---
Actually starting to look like it is the other way around and this guy is spreading misinformation.
---
There are more important things that need improving in FO76 than this crap.
---
We have all suggested that, but for some reason they don't want to do it.
---
Well it's actually fine, i mean it'd be nice to have all rise because i just like weapons with raw high damage and i'd have gotten it if i had known it scales with your current lvl but if someone just gave me all good weapons then what's the point of playing.
---
I did play the quest and apparently didn‚Äôt look close enough. I bought mine and I‚Äôm asking out of curiosity.
---
Actually they have said this is something they are working on.
---
You should really keep yourself informed
---
Kill the two sentry bots outside of whitesprings for fusion cores, you are guaranteed 2 each time you load in.
---
Oh good, they are finally willing to *plan* about fixing something the community has been asking for since launch!
---
This is wonderful news, tell your masters that we are pleased.
---
Never heard someone say that in a game before XD.
---
Heading out thanks for the few that stopped by!
---
Can't pvp during events so a player dropped grenade shouldn't do any damage. Although I've not tried it.
---
Okay thanks I‚Äôll check tomorrow. Such an odd organization method sometimes...
---
For free content or Atoms fun bucks?
---
Did you read the plan by chance?
---
Has anyone seen a legendary in watoga since the update? I know I haven‚Äôt.
---
Then you have not finished the quest if you have not found the recall board. One of the last few tasks is to dig around within one of the towering estates in the Ash Heap
---
I'm guessing you're a stealth sniper build since you're asking about weightless. If so Sentinel is the ticket. It's a third effect (so it's only on 3* pieces) and prevents 15% damage from all sources when standing still. 
---
If you're a melee guy, Cavalier will be more your speed. Same as Sentinel except the effect is applied when sprinting instead of standing still.
---
What‚Äôs wrong with that? It‚Äôs how I hold things...
---
First. Congrats if your were trying to be a big dick. You succeeded 
---
Second maybe intraday of trying for the first and kept yourself informed you‚Äôd be less bitter and ignorant.
---
Wait, it's tomorrow? Sure as hell ready then.
---
I won‚Äôt believe upvoted comments simply because they are upvoted. Ghouls‚Äô names are bugged since Diseased sometimes overrides Legendary so we won‚Äôt know until we killed them. I‚Äôve also come across diseased mirelurk queen and gulpers that dropped legendary loots (one star of course). For robots there are diseased ones sometimes spawned at WS golf club after the nuke dissipated, but they aren‚Äôt legendary, the legendary ones will say legendary in their names. As for watoga I used to wipe out all robots just to get aluminum and circuit boards, never even once a normal robot dropped a legendary loot, zero. Like i said if someone can capture it on vid I‚Äôll believe it, otherwise they can upvote all they want and I still know Bethesda nerfed the legendary watoga bots.
---
God no, I suck at math. Why would I care what 1/2 + 1/3 is?
---
(j/k, I know that a faction is what happens when a fact and a fiction love each other very much)
---
I've noticed this too, definitely nerfed.
---
I dug around but don't have one of those. Never crafted one, never sold or scrapped it, I just never got one from the quest. It's marked as completed too
---
Stop that! You'll go blind!
---
Thank you, I always succeed.
---
But come on, there's no need to be so hostile about it. We are all friends here.
---
I did that and then went to craft the card in the work bench and then recalled the sheepsquatch and killed it.
---
Um yeah unless you have some quirky mutation Chally won‚Äôt go gangsta on you.  I found him/her at WS yesterday and followed them around and Graham was ganking fools left and right.
---
I'm on PC, which is rather under-represented on the market unfortunately...
---
I loved the week when their spawn rate was increased by something like 200% ? All that ballistic fiber &lt;3
---
FUCK YES LETS GO
---
Anything 35 + is good for pvp. Damage is weird in this game and everything seems viable.
---
after hours of trying he finally spawned, he only sold a green knit hat and the red skiing outfit... yea thanks bethesda
---
Fasnacht masks and crafting alcoholic beverages is more important than a stable, consistent game experience.
---
You were hostile to start. You answered the OP's question in a childish way with such a stupid "I hate Bethesda" attitude. 
---
For someone so critical about Bethesda and the this game, you would think that you would actually keep yourself informed.
---
But instead the reason you have that shitty attitude is because you are ignorant and know nothing because you are lazy.
---
Actually I am now that I have seen spoilersquatch actually require a little effort and teamwork. I have faith now that there may be a ‚Äúbossier‚Äù boss fight in the works.
---
Absolutely my man I mean we sooo need a new DLC right now !!!
---
I just wanted to partially correct myself here.
---
I found a Vampire's Mr. Handy Buzz Blade.  It absolutely grants healing on every tick of damage it does, not just when you first use it.  It wouldn't surprise me if the Ripper does the same thing.
---
O crashed once even on my One X. It was right at the end of his health, too!
---
there is a mod for this
---
Completely agree, have been wanting this since launch. It'd be a nice way to make me feel like I'm contributing something to the world, by actively aiding factions and whatnot.
---
Never meant to be ten year games. It‚Äôs a common misconception.
---
I understand that is your perception. I don't see it that way at all.
---
Sorry that for some reason I have made you angry. I can see that you are very sensitive.
---
They are separate. So you can have a camp, and as many workshops as you can claim.
---
I'm level 40 with a shitty random perks build and all my weapons suck so much ass that killing a level one scorched is hard I have no good legendaries and no ammo left so I think I'll just quit again and come back a month later and deal with this shit later like I did the last 5 times
---
if you kept everything good that dropped you wouldnt have any stash space all my treasures are on my bank character. so it doesnt have to be duped probably just someones banker/mule character. 
---
their sole purpose is to be overencumbered so your main char is not.
---
Life saver!
---
If you're on ps4 i can give you a good weapon and craft you a few thousand ammo for free. I've felt that way a few times when I was lower and it wasn't especially fun.
---
To avoid OP stacking of caps. Probably
---
^Truth
---
Plus the workshops you claim are free fast travel points.
---
It just works!
---
Im using a day 1 edition of the xbone and not had any lag issues has multiple server crashes what lead to game crashes no lag tho
---
What weapon do you use and how much damage does it do? I‚Äôm sure some of us can give you some tips.
---
Yep. The green crystals sticking out of their skin slowly grow inside them and begin to limit movement. If they stay in place for too long they'll petrify in that position.
---
Decreased overall but seems to have increased in defend events.
---
Atleast thats what I and some of my friends have seen.
---
I‚Äôve seen that workshops with ‚Äúplayer built structures ‚Äú cost more caps
---
Well I am on ps4 but I'm good I'll just keep playing on my own I was a bit angry at first but now it's cool I took a shower and I'm back on the game
---
Pretty sure there's a bug rn that won't let you equip mods
---
I get so many plans the way I play now that I have to drop them for weight, and I love being able to do this
---
Still there for me
---
Sounds very good! I did some testing by myself and here are the results: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bdo5s8/testing_results_about_weapon_damage/?
---
I feel your pain man!  On multiple ovations I‚Äôve spent a good chunk of time claiming, building and preping multiple workshops.  And once I‚Äôm ready to let them rake in the loot while I start exploring..... Crash!!!
---
With an exasperated sigh, I normally abandon that endeavor for that session and just not even waste my time.
---
Add white springs golf club to your run.  There's more can traps there.  About 4
---
I did whitesprings several times today mostly garbage but did manage to get up to 6-8 legendary items per session and overall 2 , 3*** items only
---
That makes me wonder if you're the same guy as another IBBugsy I know, LOL
---
Thanks! I really appreciate it. I‚Äôm just days into the game and have been reading on it too. Some say explosive weapons aren‚Äôt worth it others like heavy guns. Some shotguns and rifles so idk lol. I want to play tank/do lots of dmg but also not be a piece of glass when getting attacked even if i move slow (was thinking about skipping on AP perks but idk). I can care less about other perks (hacking/lockpicking etc)
---
6 months ago.
---
To be fair, that is the appropriate response
---
Corporate bootlicker right cheeerre. I bet you like cops and the troops too lmao
---
That was the Twist. I think they hired M-Night Shymylan to write this quest.
---
I truly don't mind helping out at all, I have plenty of weapons, can craft you some power armor if you want, whatever, rather it go to someone who will appreciate and get some use out of it. Up to you of course!
---
They also said I wouldnt get drills from the legendary loot pool but herw I am aparantly hacking them into their invwntory.
---
Yeah, but it makes me sad :(
---
Yeah I'm with you on not believing upvoted comments, which is precisely why I'm doing this.  It used to take me 5-6 server hops *max* to find legendary protectrons and usually at least one 3* and usually multiple of both.  Bethesda has clearly stealth nerfed this and I have no idea why people are trying to say otherwise or why they aren't saying anything.  Hopefully this will help awareness at least.
---
You can have up to 5 characters on one account so technically you can have up to 125k, but not very helpful if you don‚Äôt have a trustworthy friend to help transfer them when needed!
---
So 10k water for a max level BE Gun?
---
Bad thing is most people are just doing the quest line and going through the motions. They are not privy to the Reditt information and end up starting the quest without knowing what it entails. I play with slot of retired guys who don't use social media so they don't know all the hooplah about the game. The only way they know what's going on with the updates is if I tell them. 2 started the event and had no idea what they were doing and definitely were not prepared. 
---
I get it... Read the notes and such and you can figure it out but that's boring for some. 
---
Just sayin, some start the event without even knowing it.
---
Yeah after 20 hours of play it's insanely obvious that my 3* legendary rate is down massively and it's enough data to rule out random variance. I've been running the same route for months. The guy arguing that there is no proof was also asking how to find a non legendary Dragon 4 hours ago, so I doubt he has enough experience to know.
---
That last update nerfed the spawn rate by more than just a few % points.
---
Near a station (especially in survival). Watoga is the obvious choice because it's popular and flat.
---
Your reading ryze's runes on his books (league of legends) your gonna tear reality apart.
---
I run mostly sniper but switch to pa and one handed in nuke zones.
---
Trying hard to hold out until legendaries venders come out next month. You could create another character and have a trusted friend help you transfer items to a ‚Äúmule‚Äù.
---
Scumbag?! Your doing them a favor and starting them at max health!
---
As opposed to ten caps for another damned bloodied golf club? Sure.
---
Free dlc no pass
---
Electricity works roughly the same as it did in Fallout 4.  The big thing is having enough of the standard wall connectors to blanket the area in power for lights.  If your daring you can try to work with conduit if you have the plans for it.  If you stumble across another player's camp take a look around as long as it's not locked up and you can get an idea as to what to do.
---
If I recall, Watoga railroad vendor sometimes has it.
---
I have a X1X and when I get multiple dc I hard reset the console and say a prayer. Sometimes works sometimes it doesn‚Äôt help. Servers have been touching lately
---
If you have 700 hours, seriously, play something else instead of worrying about content for singleplayer people.
---
Search reddit for mods broken.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
25k feels overpowered?
---
No, its the weapon, I learned the helmet without a plan
---
Im the same my dude ive got 3 mule characters thats how i get around it
---
I'm talking everywhere. Whitesprings is such a dense area that you are almost guaranteed to find 1-2 legendaries. It's the areas that spawn less than a dozen enemies that it's most noticeable.
---
What killed the Whitespring is the fact that spawns aren't instanced anymore and half the time I go there nothing spawns.
---
Probably not
---
BS Gtavo did have stuff on release, more stuff than 76.

Hey, tomorrow. Me and my brother. We like to talk lore and find small stories everywhere. You down?
---
In my recint experiance, if it's on a floor, it gets saved as a blueprint with that floor. If the floors are connected, it's all one blueprint. So, for example, I made a home surrounding a resource node, and had an extractor on the node, and a small platform with turrets outside. All three of those were separate blueprints.
---
Create a mule character if you really want to keep more items than you can carry. Other than that If your plan is to sell on here just watch the market. It will tell you what's selling and what isn't, what's popular and what is not. Just because it isn't popular though doesn't mean it's not good or hold value.  You'll know after you start posting and no one is buying, what's valuable and what's not. Other than that, I've been really looking at what aid and junk I use and trying to thin the heard as much as possible. Some things I find your better off buying when you need vs hoarding in the stash. Hope that helps.
---
Theres fuck all to do. Period.
---
Sure. What time?
---
The more stuff built the more it costs to take over generally, I've found..  But you always get your money's worth if you can keep it so I dont pay too much attention

So much üò¢ sadness üò¢

That's a ludicrous argument.

Why would a gaming company want to lose a player with 700 hours in their game?

This honestly is the best thing ever seen on this sub

They should use that dumbass announcement board to tell people this . It‚Äôs probably a 100 of these posts a day
---
Well, I can't find any evidence in the ESM that legendary prefixes directly affect durability loss. Curve table 2 for weapons is apparently related to durability loss, and connects to a JSON table that looks like this (example for standard energy weapons):
---
|x|y|
---
|:-|:-|
---
|1|0.099|
---
|10|0.009|
---
|20|0.011|
---
|30|0.015|
---
|40|0.017|
---
|50|0.017|
---
|60|0.017|
---
|100|0.017|
---
I would guess that x is the damage value and y is either that raw condition loss per shot, or a multiplier of the damage. Whether it's based on some base damage value, the calculated pip-boy damage or the damage actually dealt, I have no idea.
---
Yeah I get drills too lol
---
You win the internet. Someone give this person a cookie.
---
Okay.. there is a junk item assaultron head used for crafting, you can also get and could make an assaultron gun and helmet. The as of yet unreleased imposted assaultron weapon was tied to the assaultron plans, perhaps in error, and now the option to mod (and I guess craft) the weapon is missing.
---
Try running a wire from your router to Xbox to eliminate possibilities
---
I use them when I'm injured but healed.
---
Anything 1* and under.. Get rid of..also whichever ammo u use..use all of your resources and craft that ammo..u will see a huge difference
---
Even Faction v Faction events, making the workshops aligned to your faction when you take it over etc.
---
Xbox has a service called Game Pass
---
Pay X amount per month to get Y free games
---
Not lose you. You'll be back when an update for ypu comes. But they can focus on multiplayer events/etc. Thayt IS what 76 marketed with. All im saying is you complaining about a lack of singleplayer content, and feeling entitled that bethesda cater to you, is ridiculous. You already got 700 hours for your money. Chill.
---
I'm hoping that expansion is going to be this, because they did say it would take us to a new area and storyline from what we've seen so far.
---
More like 1 canned dog food
---
Plans still work though. But then there's the godawful amount of caps for good plans, then the materials needed.
---
I do it cause I have super duper and the other perk that doubles all chem making. When I dilute 1 stimpak I normally get 8 diluted. It's just a way to get wayyyy more. For example if I need up with 10 stims I'll dilute 4 of them and get like 25 diluted. So with 10 stims I now have 6 + like 25 diluted.
---
Where do they drop by the cabins?
---
Oh that i dont know.
---
4:00 EST.
---
just spent the better part of an hour setting up a workshop so i could get some acid ( so i can make the awesome lemon-aid that is way more inportant them a game that actually works) 30 seconds later "controls are not responding"  and BOOM I'm here writing this.... well back to it. BTW the cute red head named mattola69 will be giving away free lemon-aid soon maybe....
---
Light, sturdy and heavy have the same mods. So yes.
---
Ya. It would just be nice to see those player created factions anchored in the game world. So if you and your raider friends took over Monongha Power, it would he Raider property, and then me and my BoS associates could come wipe your filth from the earth :D lol
---
I'm not super sure. When I initially got Team Medic I thought more stims to help my team would be the reason, but it just makes me less effective over a longer period of time. Maybe if you maxed out First Aid too? That might be a big help.
---
Are x-01 mod plans even a thing?
---
Yea but why have diluted in general, they just don't heal much, I could do the same thing and have thousands of then but I think they suck
---
Oof, I can‚Äôt do four, I‚Äôm in school at that time. Sorry.
---
Darn i am dying to use this mod, I don't have the plans for it unfortunately. Thanks though
---
Ok
---
With my stealth pistol build, no PA, I do go through on occaision without changing perks,he's better at night so I try to time it for 6pm in game.
---
I run like a coward when danger hits until I can get it back to caution. I have completely exited west tec to get away.
---
Just adds to the fun being squishy.
---
U know what I'm trying to say right?
---
Because with the chemist perk (double drug crafting yield) you can turn one stimpak into 4 diluted stimpaks. This means that you make a profit of 2 diluted stimpaks, which is equivalent to a regular stimpak.
---
Effectively, with the right perk you can magic the equivalent of a free stimpak out of your arse for 2 purified water.
---
I love this.
---
It's the worst aspect of the game to me. You just have to either make mules (which I haven't, because I play solo), or just drop stuff you don't want to get rid of.
---
Eh, just post when you can. I'm usually on after 4 for awhile.
---
What console?
---
I can build you into the modern era if it‚Äôs xbox
---
(Just provide me material)
---
I‚Äôve been too afraid to go to the mire/cranberry bog over the course of my 100+ hours of gameplay, and this might finally serve as the impetus and get me to do so. I‚Äôm probably going to do the camera quest first tho
---
This blows i hope they patch this asap
---
Yea but there isn't a perk that doesn't increase the healing effects of diluted stimpak's
---
Yes, I was trying to make a joke of my own.
---
Ok. Thanks.
---
It‚Äôs a pistol
---
So as far as the topic of this thread goes........
---
You think that the burrows will be the deathblow to the traditional Fallout player who doesn't want to have end game gear locked behind multiplayer events?
---
I'm hearing the Mission Impossible theme
---
Yes I know the chemist perk but I don't like diluted stimpak's in general, why heal less in a fight for example
---
They should just copy the blood splattered skin they did for combat armor (I think) and let us put that on Raider Power Armor.
---
The double negative is confusing me. So First Aid doesn't effect diluted stims? Really?
---
U met an experienced player who probably has multiple alts..for mule-purposes specifically ..no u are not at risk to getting banned
---
They can heal roughly a third of your hp, so they would be your typical mid fight im taking damage but im not about to die heals. 
---
As a lvl 117 you shouldn't have much issue with anything at this point. Assuming you even need healing, a normal stimpack would probably be overheals.
---
I really hope they choose to add faction themed items. Even if it‚Äôs just a Flag It would still make my BOS themed Camp 10x better. 
---
They should make it so you get a flag for each faction you join. Or just sell them in the Atomic shop, either way I‚Äôm happy.
---
I was about to say how do I transfer between characters? I dont own 2 Playstation 4s with Fallout 76 on both.
---
I also don't like scrounging for stuff. Like to make regular stimpaks. I'd rather explore and kill stuff and then just have stims from enemies and such. Why do you not really have an issue making them?
---
Because you can build up a large surplus, which is good for healing smaller amounts of damage. And as you have more stims available to panic spam.
---
I hope its really challenging, tougher that sheepsasqcach and sbq
---
+karma
---
Did that event for the first time, and I could see accidentally eating someone in that fucking chaos.
---
I think that this one activity may require a team to finish, and that's okay.
---
Yea but it's also hit hard to get stimpak's. I just don't like diluted stimpak's
---
Whoops, my bad. Have about 3 'mod problems' posts going at once. Sorry, other armor sets have plans, X-01 is just mods right now
---
Yea but you have to do a animation like using a normal stimpak, unless you're in power armor
---
I have never thought to do this!! I‚Äôve saved every gunpowder since day one!! Guess it‚Äôll time for some 45 and 5.56
---
I'm down! GT is Kaise7en.
---
If it makes you feel any better, I have used Google translate too many times to count in order to speak German or Spanish with others in games.
---
It's a little slow, but I enjoy the experience and love playing with people from all over the world.
---
Yea so your buddy would just sell you a bullet for say 20k, then you make a new character and sell that friend something for that 20k. Then just have to figure out what to spend all those caps on!!!
---
There's a really good place to get tick blood to make bloodpacks, I sever hop a few times and bam, I slehave like 36 tick blood
---
I play a P.A melee specialist, so it works pretty well for me
---
Alright. I‚Äôll add you, and see if I can actually GT my game to work.
---
it's so hard to tell, sorry!
---
I didn't ask if you thought it was okay or not.
---
I asked if people thought...... this would be the point in the game where Bethesda pushes away solo players by locking end game content behind multiplayer activities?
---
It's a simple question.....no need to be a troll.
---
More efficient if you are bloodied. Your health is low anyways.
---
Gunpowder is so heavy..another tip..any plans u didn't learn yet in your inventory..learn
---
Do you mean the perk that makes you heal faster?
---
That's true
---
I‚Äôm the exact same... I even try to find lower levels to give stuff depending on levels and they work even look at you..
---
Well I believe you cant start it up without being on a team so maybe there needs to be a (recommended 8+) on the quest info, It basically outlines the entire process in the terminal you start the event with. It may be boring to some reading the extra information leading up to the terminal, but it's just incredibly frustrating blowing through 35 stimpaks. You can pretty much get chased around the pylon while 5 other mid level people spam it, and kill her in about 2 minutes.
---
The kind you can put a pump down on if you build camp there.
---
Hi everyone, I just turned 55 and have been playing fo76 since  Jan 2019.  My husband got me hooked, and we some times play with out 2 grown son who live in Dallas and Florida.  We are in Houston.  My hubby and I have made friends playing fo76.  We love to give stuff to new players.  Since I'm officially a senior now I hope to keep on rockin fo76 for a long time.
---
I'm bloodied so all I use it diluted. I have 2x the amount then I can use in PvP.
---
That makes sense, you can actually spam in pa
---
Exactly what happened to me. I was aware of the event, and the questline leading up to it. Just didn't quite realize when I completed that quest what would happen next.
---
Tons of people showed up, and that shit went down in a few minutes. Was about level 33 or something, only died once. Sounds like I got lucky.
---
The limit is one measure to combat inflation and cheating. Like many real-world inflation-fighting measures, its unpopular when it‚Äôs doing its job. 
---
If you‚Äôre at the cap cap, you should probably buy something. If you‚Äôre at the cap cap and stash limit, you should probably buy something expensive and small. It‚Äôs like Brewster‚Äôs Millions. Have fun with it.
---
Unless this dungeon has some kinda of time limit on it, I actually think the exact opposite of what you said. This is an instanced dungy so take your time and go carefully and all the mobs are yours.  They even confirmed it is possible to solo which means no mechanics like have 2 people stand in different spots to open a door or push 2 buttons on opposite sides of the dungy simultaneously crap, that would make it impossible for a solo player.
---
Unfortunately, I currently cannot connect the xbox directly into the router. I do however have a powerline adapter.  Both wireless and wired (by powerline) yield the same results.
---
Or sugar, for when making rum
---
The kind you can put a resource pump down on if your camp is there.
---
Because for everyone 1 Stimpak I have, I have the chance to craft 8 diluted ones.
---
So, if I start with 100 Stimpaks, I'll usually end up with 650 or so diluted ones.
---
I've done it twice without being on a team.
---
Stimpacks are pretty easy if you know where the blood ticks are. 
---
I mean no one's making you use em. I personally carry stimpacks and super stims. I only have the super stims key bound and just let my auto stim legendary heal me if I'm low. Can usually wipe an entire pack without needing to heal and afterwards my mutation gets me back up.
---
That's true, I do bloodied too but I use normal so if I get damaged I'm already healing again faster
---
Would be nice to just have an account wide cap. 125k total between characters.  As of now it's just a hassle moving around between alts. 
---
Sure, some items will get more expensive, but it will also reduce the "trade only" sales and in turn help reduce the plague of scammers victimizing the various marketplaces.
---
Yes I know I just didn't see the appeal of them in game
---
The silver lining there is you saved 2 stimpacks.
---
True, I use super stims while fighting the queen
---
Yea I give every plan that known away usually at Flatwoods overseers crate. Never paid attention to gunpowder weight..
---
The exact reply I was looking for. You passed the test! Good job, fellow Patriot.
---
Completed this event the other day and the Sheepsquatch Imposter kindly dropped me a Legendary Cryolator that does extra damage to robots... how ironic!
---
Really? There's new offers every 30 minutes for me on the discord. I'm pc as well.
---
I‚Äôve got 3 on PC
---
I  also dump all the ammo I don't use at vault 76
---
Well i think because a normal stim pack heals a lot and if i'm just a little bit injured i don't wanna waste it.
---
First Aid makes stims more effective like Pharmacist for RadAway. Not faster.
---
Makes sense, but it's also not hard to get stims either
---
Absolutely. When I was leveling my alt he stayed in a hazmat suit until I got Starched Genes and put it on anytime afterwards he was in WS. 
---
Slowly rolled around the houses taking out any ghoul that dared pop its head up. Make a racket outside to draw them out, then return to sneak and clear them out. Head inside to take down any stragglers. 
---
The hazmat suit was essential. He was bloodied and ghouls deal rad damage.
---
And I'm the guy who doesn't read any of the quest line unfortunately and never really listen to holo tapes. I just tap tap tap til the messages go away. My first time I didn't even know it was starting til it was too late. Was not prepared and got disconnected shortly after it started. So it is possible to do it solo. If I would have paid attention I wouldn't have started it but it happens.
---
I hope that's the way it is. I've seen games in the past lock end game content behind multiplayer events that can't be done solo and I really hope this doesn't go that route  it kinda seems like Bethesda is pushing legendary farming towards events like Scorched Earth, Encrypted, and now the Burrows
---
I wouldn't mind if they stretch it out to 2 weeks (or longer) before that one and then the other 2 if they're all going to be limited time like the Bone Raider one. Farming the atoms for a PA skin 4 weeks in a row is going to be tough.
---
This is what I was gonna say. If you‚Äôre a low health build then a normal stimpak is usually gonna be wasted anyway. You can‚Äôt revive other people with diluted ones however.
---
Heard it's for the assaultron helmet. Try that.
---
That would be cool and maybe some random bones jangling about or a human head necklace or human hand/finger gauntlets or perhaps some fur to cover vitals to add to the mystery .. anything really it's hard enough finding recipes for raider armor or in general we need more raider schtuff
---
The popularity rests in the fact you can literally get more healing for the same costs.
---
Would you rather have $100 in $1 Bills, or 800 Quarters?
---
When the weight is reduced to 90%, in becomes a non factor imo.
---
wow. just wow. I feel like your local news is intentionally trying to get people to mix &amp; autotune their broadcasts into songs
---
Definitely. I noticed this after the server maintenance shutdown prior to the latest patch. Over 10 hops not even a single one. Somehow they reverted it shortly after and finally nerfed it in the latest update. Not sure why so many upvotes for some claims without proof. UI bug lol yea my UI must so bugged there‚Äôs a shiny new clothes on that bot but on my screen it‚Äôs naked.
---
200 lead scrap is actually on the low end of how much lead you can get from Lucky Hole. Throw on some Excavator Power Armor and it‚Äôs easy to walk out of a run with 200-400 Lead Ore. Every 2 ore refines into 5 scrap. Once you add in the bonus scrap from using the Super Duper perk while smelting, you can easily end up with 1000+ lead per run.
---
[](/celestiasmug)It's not hard to get if you want it. It can take forever tho, I just spent a day and a half getting one.
---
pay no more than 2k..very very serious
---
Why not both?  Make everyone happy.
---
I didn't really think I'd the weight part of it, but yea with travelling pharmacy it's nice
---
Where are the blood ticks located? I want to make antibiotics...
---
Damn, didn't think of that.
---
Oh ok
---
I got it many times on my other characters, I just don't want to go through all that time trying to get it again
---
Vlad and Mia are awesome. I wish they had a quest line or something.
---
They really need to fix this so that people stop making a new post about it every half dozen posts or so...
---
Welcome to Whitesprings, where you can't use a shotgun without being killed and robots, lots of robots.
---
Yeah, dude is full of shit. I'm on run #14 now of Watoga logging everything....except there is nothing to log.  0 legendary labels, 0 drops, 246 kills. This is not bad rng. I'll probably stop at 25 runs since it's already getting late but that will be more than enough data to prove it since I'm at 0 so far and I expect to end with 0.
---
The main reason is that diluted ones don't interfere with mutations like regular ones
---
Ends in a separate note, if I split my stimpacks up 8 to 1, it's really a lot easier for me to give stuff to new players. More love to spread.
---
Diluted stimpaks weigh less than the regular ones
---
The changes to re-logging reliably causing respawn was a huge nerf to legendary spawns but was arguably just ending an exploit.
---
Anyone on ps4 wanna preplan grouping up tomorrow I‚Äôll be free after 1pm eastern time?
---
Yea but that isn't gonna sell it for me lol
---
Same I have a mule character. I put what I want to keep in a server container grab a few gamertags. Switch characters, Come back to world and pick everything up. Its risky but hasn't failed me yet
---
I didn‚Äôt play fo4.   Good idea though.
---
My best are bloodied .50cal and a bloodied gatling plasma. 
---
1* both of them but with my build they shred, at least I like to think so hahah
---
Wym
---
Fucking shit yeah
---
True
---
Ah memories. 'Hello. Hello.Hello.Hello. Hello.Hello.Hello. Hello.Hello.Hello. Hello.Hello'
---
I never trolled. I engaged in conversation, jesus christ. If you can't handle this, get off reddit, stop logging 700 hours and get a life.
---
Thank you kind sir.   I‚Äôll hit you up in the next few days if I can‚Äôt figure it out.
---
It‚Äôs a bug. Please read the subreddit before you post.
---
My favorite is the little camp and HELP spelled out on the roof of the Red Rocket in Flatwoods. Its nothing all that amazing, but it was one of the first things I stumbled across when I first got Marsupial.
---
I would guess the energy weapon ones. Not sure though.
---
Unfortunately I‚Äôm on xb1. Did you get them from events?
---
You may have missed a few.
---
Using Excavator PA to farm ore, then Super Duper (3) to smelt, you can get much, much more lead--easily 3x that amount. There also that crystal...you can make some pretty good coin with that.
---
I'm sorry if I sounded arrogant on the post. I understand that you dont always read the important stuff. I just am post super failure encryptid event.
---
I save them all for the legendary vendor next month. Have 9 mules now totally overloaded with nothing. It legendary weapons and armour lol. It passes the tine
---
Mods broken. Plans work.
---
Yeah! It's blue and yellow and even has Vault Boy on it!
---
I just want a multiplayer Doctor Who experience :/ Fallout Who for life!
---
I also spend 2 hours a day in the gym and work full time.
---
You mad?
---
There aren't any energy weapon specific damage perks.
---
ANDALE REPRESENT!!
---
Lol I read your previous reply wrong. I read ‚Äúfirst power armor build‚Äù not ‚Äúmy first build will be‚Äî‚Äú my bad. 
---
This is a long one coming lol
---
Look through the perks because there are some cool perks for tanky builds, especially heavy weapon tank builds typically run melee or heavy weapons. 
---
Explosives is good if you use an auto grenade launcher. It does the same damage per shot as the single shot grenade launcher, I believe 210 damage, which is very good. I believe that‚Äôs just short of a two handed melee build. But it‚Äôs full auto, can kill inexperienced users, and can blow legendary bodies sky high on accident. I use it as a crowd clearer or scorchbeast nuker. Also it benefits from Bear Arms, 90% weight reduction making it and other heavy weapons weigh less than pistols, and the perk that increases heavy reload speed by 30%. 
---
Heavy weapons have good damage, not like a rifle or shotgun, but heavy weapons have all ranges. Harpoon fun for sniping, harpoon gun has a shotgun-like mod too. Gatling, 50 cal, medium range, fast firing inaccurate weapons like Minigun and Plasma Gatling for close range damage. The Gatling gun I use does 100+ damage per shot, has 500 rounds due to double ammo cap, and I can increase it further. I also have a MG42 with vampire which heals 5 health per hit, and is one of the fastest shooting guns in the game. Mix that with a STR perk that increases physical defense while shooting a heavy gun and you have good damage, range, stagger, the highest possible defense, and self healing. 
---
Serendipity in luck doesn‚Äôt work while wearing PA. 
---
If you don‚Äôt like VATS and you don‚Äôt mind not sprinting or bashing, and you don‚Äôt go melee, then pick up the agi perk that uses 30 AP per hit to ignore 30% of incoming damage. Pretty sure this works even with PA. 
---
While solo pick up all perks of Lone Wanderer, 20% extra defense and 10% AP Regen if I remember correctly. When in a team swap this out for bodyguards, this gives you more defense based on number of people in your group. Or if you have enough defense and don‚Äôt want a lot of Charisma, get lone wanderer (4 charisma) and swap it out with level 2 of rad sponge and the perk that heals teammates when using a stimpak. Makes you kinda like a paladin, curing rads on nearby teammates, when you have some rads. Since you‚Äôre a tank, you‚Äôll be using a lot of stimpaks no matter how much defense you get. 
---
You can mix the paladin style with the perk that makes flame throwers heal teammates. 
---
I also use the perk for double chem times and no addiction. Med-x, psychotats, and bufftats for even more damage and defense. 
---
Endurance is good if you like the perks otherwise don‚Äôt worry about it. The health bonus isn‚Äôt much unless they buff it. I used no endurance on my tanky build and was just fine.
---
[](/celestia)Well, good luck friend, r/fo76bazaar seems to be firm on 3-4k per coat from a quick search.
---
No. But amazing how doing all that and you are still a soft cunt.
---
I believe it's affected by the Heavy Gunner group of perks. I know it's weight is affected (or at least used to be) by Bear Arms.
---
Don't use atoms if you have a reasonable amount of members doing it with you. Just die and respawn asap.
---
With six pack abs.
---
For me it prevents over-healing. It's just economic in my mind to use 1/2 a stimpak for 30% and if I need more, use another one rather than over-healing myself. If you have medic perks, a diluted stimpak also heals more.
---
The other thing is, in Survival, AFAIK Stimpks have a cool down and can't stack. So having all 3 stimpak types lets you heal more at once.
---
Well I have over a hundred so it‚Äôs fine
---
One day a random player and I started hanging out, which is weird because I normally play totally solo, and we took turns walking the tight rope. I got some great pics of that guy and I love when they come up on my loading screen. Hope that random guy is happy somewhere...
---
This is the quality posts I sub for!
---
[Throws Grenade] BOOM +10k XP. 
---
An exaggeration, but I had gotten 5k+ using orbitals at the golf club before they changed the XP payout.
---
what animation?
---
Meh that's my guess
---
What if there is a team of 13
---
The gnomes are clearly forcing him to do it. Secret mafia of gnomes at work.
---
When you use a stimpak
---
Heavy then.
---
Dont forget the lead weight by the canon balls between the 2 can chime setups!!!
---
- Sell, scrap, drop anything that you don't use. Like armor or weapons 
---
- Do you use chems? If not sell every single one besides rad away and stim packs and sell those as well if you have more than 100 or so. Same with bobbleheads and magazines, canned food etc.
---
- You need to keep your junk at a low level as well. I usually craft the same things (mostly weapons) so i need a lot of aluminum, copper etc. But the most rare stuff are screws. So why should i keep 200 alumium when i have like 50 screws? What i mean by that is keep every crafting component at the level of the most rare ressource because you can't use it anyway.
---
- craft ammo or sell/drop lead and gunpowder because that stuff weighs a lot
---
- if you found a legendary weapon you want to keep but not equip right now then modify it with some mods that keep the weight low
---
How about: No. You're in a PvP mode in a group, you don't need more of an advantage by having half the server being in pseudo-group teaming up on the solo players.
---
You could scroll through the different atom shop sections and see if anything shows as owned that you didn't buy. At the least it could give you more info to add in when you try to get the atoms back.
---
My first time starting the even I was disconnected.
---
Well yeah that's true
---
I've noticed this. I've been abusing it on packs of charred ghouls in stealth.
---
Do what
---
Acid is the new gold
---
Now who's trolling? Lol.
---
Diluted stim packs
---
THANK YOU! It‚Äôs so fucking whiny and most are asking for the game to play itself. 
---
Awwww I didn‚Äôt get a 3 star for killing a 3 star ghoul... well no shit??? It takes two shots to kill.
---
the hanging bone alrms for sure
---
I agree. End game battles are for end game players. Don't go into the SBQ fight with your level 18 ass.
---
You'll probably want the Advanced Power Connector plans. It's sold by the vendor bot Wallace, the Watoga vendor bot, and MODUS production terminal.
---
The bulks will turn on when near either a generator or a conduit. The easiest thing to do is place a couple of spaced conduits or pylons on your roof and power them. That'll power your normal bulbs.
---
Stay behind them bashing the head in vats. Pretty easy to avoid damage
---
My guess is you turn in items for tokens, then are able to spend those tokens for a chance to roll an entirely new item. 
---
If this is the case, they'll have some anti-farming mechanism in place so that you can't just continually re-roll until you get what you want.  Something like the possibility of 3 tokens spent on a 3* potentially being a 1 *or 2* or requiring 5-10 (or more) to guarantee a 3*.
---
I appreciate that you took time to review my comments, but the piece you‚Äôre missing is the timing of everything.  OP came out aggressively after the very first comment asking if she was talking about another UI element.  It wasn‚Äôt until after the second person was aggressed that i even approached the angle that maybe she wasn‚Äôt seeing things the same of the rest of us.  I also pointed out in another comment that perhaps she wasn‚Äôt explaining things clearly.
---
Those comments you‚Äôre talking about which were dismissive didn‚Äôt even exist on the page until i had already begun my post about color blindness.
---
As an aside, After every response I received from OP, one or more people went through my comment history and down-voted my entire history.  
---
Of course it looks bad when you have a hundred people being a prick to one person asking for help...  right up until you take note that the person everyone seems to be ganging up on came out swinging against people who were just trying to understand.
---
I kill all the wasteland creatures I'll trade all my kills for your legendary guns.
---
The Flatwoods gym is crazy for lead. Daily runs there can lead to huge stockpiles.
---
Not glitched, nerfed.
---
Are pylons and conduits in the same plan?
---
I accidentally scrapped it even thought I had it favorited and had Save My Stuff installed, which is how I learned it's an outdated mod now :(
---
Agreed. But you can‚Äôt do anything stop them from showing up. Sans for making Queenie exist in a new cell for higher levels. But that‚Äôll just spark outcry that the game ain‚Äôt being fair to all players.
---
He's thinking of radaway.
---
I go stealth sniper even in close quarters with a bloodied handmade, with the sneak perks is hard to mobs to discover you even at few inches from you.
---
I‚Äôd love one of those trailers with all the windows (there‚Äôs one behind Morgantown airport, and I think another near the fissure site by the pumpkin house). Just let us slap one of those down prefab like you could build buses in FO4.
---
If you want to discuss the Burrows and the effect on single players I'm game.
---
If you want to act like childish internet trolls I can do that also.
---
I started out with a legitimate question......you chose to go the troll route.
---
It's a post apocalyptic world. There needs to be mechanics to keep some level and illusion of scarcity. If limits on STASH and caps didn't exist a new player starting tomorrow could be and probably would be buffed greatly by players who have been around for 3-5 months.
---
It's fine to not have limits in single players games or online games where profit and wealth are a key aspect but 76 is a game where those limits help to preserve the world and gameplay for newer players and keep a level field of wealth for current players.
---
I'm level 15 casual and popped by to watch the action on the Sheepsquachtron but ended up jumping in to activate a pylon, Stimpak people calling for help, and I took shots on the Mr. Handys. Sheepy moved too fast for me to hit her but it was fun to participate.
---
Any scarecrows and some gas lamps or fires for creepy lighting
---
Agreed.  OP you must have missed some of the veins.   700+ lead scrap by the time you are done with all the ore you can get from there.   Maybe they forgot super duper when processing it all or not using excavator armor to harvest the ore in the first place.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure I found them in (typically locked) containers or out in the world. Probably the forest or the toxic valley.
---
Agreed.
---
Because with First Aid 3* they restore almost all your health. And then I usually only have 50% of my health anyway for unyielding and bloody effects. I just found out that you can't revive player with them though, so that sucks
---
This made me fully laugh. #wastelandprobs
---
Damn that sucks that you can't heal other players with them
---
It's definitely heavy guns.
---
I never trolled. Did you even read my responses? But to summarize: Nothing. It doesn't effect singleplayers at all. Keep doing what you did before.
---
If you run a low health build, you often take diluted healing to finesse how much you're actually restoring.  For me, too much RadAway and Stimpack healing can mean finding myself over-encumbered at a very inopportune time because the Unyielding effects wear off.
---
Level 42 here, started a couple of weeks ago, there's no way im able to explore them at my level,especially sincr i dont have friends :(
---
Wait the vendor is coming out tomorrow to?
---
That's actually a good roll. Instigating is really nice on high damage per shot weapons as it doubles the damage of the first shot (assuming a full health target).
---
Seems like the way someone who screenshots in Photo-mode would hold binoculars.
---
I AM SO HECKIN READY
---
Yeah, and if it's xbox 1, I'll buy it lol
---
What if there‚Äôs a bus and 100 players get perma death and only one spawn
---
Ok. Cool. Thank you for the tip
---
I'm on several times a day. Xbox one x. "sleepy4792". I'd enjoy a little adventure üòâ.
---
The wiki says yes:
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:\_Advanced\_power\_connectors](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Advanced_power_connectors)
---
It's been a while since I last had a character use the plans, so I can't 100% confirm.
---
Hey, I‚Äôm on right now if you want to join.
---
I know, I usually roll with about 20 on hand, but the new event has us all stimpacking each other so at first I couldn't figure out why I could stimpack a few people (because I had a few normals) and then couldn't.
---
Why don't you just buy it?
---
No. Not until early May
---
The stimpak recipe should be able to be bought from a vendor. I think Modus sells it for like 1k.
---
Hey thanks a lot man.  
---
It's probably not what you think it is on the whole anti-lbgt, many people will profess that whole "I'm anti-homosexuality" because of their religious beliefs, but when someone in their family is gay they just overlook it.
---
Can't right now. I have to be at the bakery early.
---
It's be pretty convenient to have all prep materials(within reason) for alcohols to be available for crafting directly from the station
---
It's just a cheat boss that lacks number logics. All this is is a assaultron dressed as a sheepsquatch there's no reasoning that I can survive other assaults while this one one shots me the technology is the same there's no armor/weapon difference it's a big stat stick. It's power should be weaker but has a durability shield that projects energy damage to compensate for it to justify its technological power. Heck even add in energy blades that avoid 35% armor. But no one shot kills or God mode BS.
---
You literally just had me singing a Kathy Mattea song lol...
---
Candles, electric chairs, one of the busts from whitesprings has half a face I find that creepy.
---
Because sometimes you don't need to heal 50% of your health, but you're crippled and dilutes will heal crippled limbs. 
---
Also, bloodied builds have less use for full power and super stims.
---
Ikr? you go through alot lol
---
3 long grueling hours, my friend.
---
That would be great I was actually able to get some mods on my power armor. Xbox One x however it doesn't seem to be operating properly so we'll see.
---
Thank you for the analysis, that bloodied railway is quite a beast there üôÄ
---
And that...is solely how we got Trump...those people CNN, Fox, MSNBC have forgotten about...Bought into the Make America Great Again deal...because they just want to be able to live again.
---
Yep. I make lots of rum so it's annoying to swap between the two benches, cause rum needs snaptail reeds and sugar to make, and sugar also needs snaptail to make
---
Thanks for the information :)
---
:)
---
That doesn‚Äôt apply to fallout. Fallout ignores your Xbox status and will show you online.
---
Something they still believe to this day...But even if Coal came back it's not the kind of coal that makes money anymore, it's the kind that's kept domestic and used for energy not steel production...
---
I can't remember where but I found three plans in three toolboxes, all in one room tonight. I've been checking them since I read the same tip recently and finding way more than before, but this one room was the best yet.
---
If you power up a power plant, or find one powered up, and can claim the workshop, hook up the generator. They make 100% charge cores, I think it‚Äôs 8/hour? Maybe more.
---
NP. 
---
High damage, low ROF weapons benefit the most from the Instigating perk. 
---
Lower damage but high ROF weapons benefit more from Furious as it's easier to stack hits.
---
Cunning would be better.üòÄ
---
That's probably the best one shot weapon ever
---
When you've found a silo tape, once a nuke is launched that isn't targeting a fissure, it triggers the script for you to see the Nuke Launch tape. The only thing after that is a script that counts how many times you've been on a server that launched a Nuke. That's why you always see the quest completing when someone launches one.
---
There are people who have claimed to have finished it and data mining the ESM I've seen weirdness with the Grafton leg of the questline, so it very well could be bugged. I just haven't had the ambition to complete it while skipping Grafton.
---
The Mothman statue makes for a great creepy temple centrepiece.
---
Can‚Äôt deny a free meal
---
Tbh finding a scorched mothman in the dark AND in the mire is 100% more terrifying

---
Flair checks out.
---
I like wood armor...but it desperately needs better stats and not to mention 2 and 3 star effects!
---
‚ÄòSorry I took a bite out of your arm, I was just trying to put a bandaid on you‚Äù
---
thanks
---
Last run through with excavator armour netted me 444 lead ore. With super duper, the first 344 ore gave me 1200+ lead scrap before I ran out of acid. I didn't keep track of what the next 100 ore gave me.
---
In the end, it helped me make more than 10k 5.56mm ammo.
---
When the Game comes offline for maintenance and Game updates, and then comes back online.
---
They run from me a LOT.
---
Maybe scale capture time to distance to bench (with edges taking forever)?
---
In one of the call of duty games there was a fun challenge where you need to cook a grenade and kill three enemies with yourself, it‚Äôs really funny to watch people keep trying and failing repeatedly üòÇ
---
I can go through 50 before I find something decent it‚Äôs all about trying and trying again till rngeezus decides to bless you
---
I had this happen about five times this weekend. I would repair 2/3 of the reactor, crash. Finally finish it, crash. Claim the camp and try making the cores, crash.  I haven't raged quit in a good number of years, but for the first time since, I actually got mad at a game.
---
well since you don't take my experiences are truth, then there's really no point in having a discussion with you is there? Since you would just plug your ears and say "that's not true, i'm not listening"
---
Instigate weapons are basically assassin weapons. Blackpowder weapons depend on burst not dps.
---
I didn't know this
---
The story is the people of vault 76 were the best and brightest so they came from all over not just west Virginia also many are said to have been born in the vault
---
You get ultracite for this one it is brotherhood. X91 is the enclave at white springs bunker.
---
Maybe make it so that you can start capture like that and once you start capture you can freely damage things without gaining wanted but still need to get to bench to finalize capture?
---
&gt; It works like this: Adrenal Reaction and Bloodied legendary effect combination is additive: if you have \~0% health, weapon damage will be (not taking perks into account yet) 300% the weapon's base damage. 
---
You're making the assumption that Adrenal Reaction on its own would peak at 2x damage. It's 1.5x, and so you've proved that it's multiplicative with Bloodied. Test with a non-Bloodied weapon if you want to check.
---
According to the ESM, Bloodied maxes at 1.95x, below 5% hp. Hence your 278 damage at point 1 would be 95\*1.95\*1.5 = 278.
---
That way it gets rid of the problem you mention but still makes it worth building defenses.
---
which again is why i said i just respawn and try and walk away but recently not only is that not good enough they don't even want to have mikes enabled so they play this multiplayer game what...without acknowledging there are multiple players?
---
What platform just out of curiosity?
---
This is the kind of sentence thats only ever said once.
---
If it's not greyed out then there is something missed.
---
LMFAO
---
You play a vault baby and the overseer is your mom.... why did you think we follow her all over the place?
---
only 70s kids will remember
---
...I mean sure, being irked at shit they do, and put in the change logs is people whinging over bad RNG. Right.  Because it's not "bad decisions by the development team, and noted in the change logs, making it significantly harder to get good gear" its "bad luck".   
---
This also isn't new. People are acting like it's new, but diseased over-riding non stared legendaries has been a thing pretty much...forever, I think?
---
Yes it's become the new "unpopular opinion" that's common.
---
Yep the sheep will follow you right into the hut and cook you üòÇ
---
cuz since fallout 4 went to the game pass i think fallout 76 will too and if i buy it and it goes to the game pass that will be a waste of money
---
While were at it, make a Handmade skin where the gun is constructed out of sawed off human hands.
---
Join the club. Everything I'm using now was bought off Reditt posts. I'm level 165 now. Still getting shitty drops most of the time. Nothing I'll ever use. So Ive been selling to buy what I would use.
---
Because of that thing you did.
---
You know.  You should be ashamed of yourself. 
---
And now you are being punished.
---
(Honestly, 80% will be filler trash, 14% will be maybe useful if you have the right build, and 1% will be the perfect thing for your playstyle.
---
The last 4% will just be odd things like 3 star wood armors that let you breath underwater.
---
Yeah, that's one of the best possible rolls for a dragon. Two shot or anti-armor would be worse since with a weapon like that you're going for a one-shot kill.
---
I'd be fine with that 
---
Or 
---
Make it more in line with the "repel the intruders" alert the owner gets. I've had owned shops contested. If you kill the attacker, it immediately ends the takeover and they have to pay to attempt a claim again.  If you make a claim (assuming the owner is there) and kill the owner it should immediately convert to you. It's a hostile takeover after all.  The owner is free to hide behind their turrets and walls. To prevent a sneak kill for an instant claim, have a brief countdown period before PvP starts, allowing the owner the choice of Fight or Flight.
---
Stabby  stabby stabby works for me. Furious Combat knife.
---
If there was an event with some panel events, speakers, cosplay, exhibits, etc...I‚Äôd travel there in a heartbeat. Then rent a car and check out some sights. Driving time from Charleston to most places on the map is under an hour. Of course most events are places like San Diego or New York - could an event in WV draw a lot of people?
---
It hets the benefits of both perk sets.
---
Well, I am on Xbox. I'll be on sometime tomorrow after the update.   sleepy4792
---
Happened with my All Rise, obviously couldn‚Äôt scrap it, but it disappeared on me.
---
The Blue Ridge Mountains are beautiful in the fall.
---
Bootleggers shack and the mill by vault 76
---
Happens to everyone. Be patient and pray to RNGesus.
---
Just know those trash drops get you caps from vendors or people on Reditt. Those caps will provide for what you really want. Now that you don't have to fast travel to 7 different vendors means your saving caps. Just keep shopping on Reddit. After almost 500hrs in the game, this is what I've found most beneficial. Sure, I've found some good armor and weapons but not for my build. So I sell and buy to get what I want specifically for my build.
---
No
---
I am on Xbox one x and it's been happenings to me since the last update.
---
Big gun. Shoot hard or fast. Explosion. Boom.
---
That is a ridiculous game concept that absolutely no one would ever play.
---
I'm not talking just Fallout:  even if you had a cartoon style, cosmetic skins, weird dances, and a building mechanic, it would just fail as a game.  No one would want to play it.
---
If you aren't in PA, and you manually stim yourself (as in, the perk or legendary effect didn't auto-stim you) there's an animation of stabbing yourself with a stimpack each time you use one.
---
I think the issue with STASH weight perks is what would happen if you remove the perk and your STASH is over-weight. It's not the biggest problem, but it's a problem. The other thing with the STASH is that it's limited for server stability. All your items load into the server when you log on, the more items there are the more resources the server uses. This was a crucial part of a couple of Dupe glitches that involved mass crafting of weapons.
---
The CAMP perks would be nice. Rather than perks, it would be nice for decorations to have an aura effect within the CAMP or a combination of both. The Sims uses those mechanics. House decorations create an aura that adds moods but each lot can also have special effects.
---
Something like having lamps that give you an AP boost or campfires increasing HP regen would go a long way to customizing. I like the thought posters and bookshelves that unlock crafting options available to all players within the CAMP. There's tons that could be done with it. Good idea.
---
Come for the vendor, stay for the super mutants!
---
So servers will probably update 10 or 9 est take about half an hour maybe an update and boom we get burrows
---
The game is supposed to be played in groups. Op suggestion is good.
---
Have one I can sell you if you want and are on ps4
---
That sucks for both of us, but it‚Äôs almost nice to know I‚Äôm not the only one. I‚Äôm currently submitting a ticket on Bethesda‚Äôs website, but I don‚Äôt have high hopes of any real response.
---
Well it would prolly be made out of mole rat meat
---
I doubt the name is that literal. Just a cool sounding name that relates to nuclear fallout. Now if there's a BR type game mode, this may be true.
---
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd even buy it again, considering this has happened to me twice. (Xbox one anyway)
---
My camp has a nicely appointed guest house (the smaller cabin that‚Äôs unlocked, my personal cabin is locked. People seem to respect it, or at least close the door as they leave). I regularly leave a gift bag of supplies for visitor. Sadly, I don‚Äôt get many. I love my location, though, and hope people stumble across it once in a while.
---
I don't want PvP, so I take them, get the challenge done, and leave. If you want it, I won't show up and fight you.
---
Noo why is everyone on Xbox
---
I‚Äôll play
---
Ahhh ok, hope you they help you, sorry about your Longcoat.
---
And that accent you‚Äôre trying so desperately to shed ‚Äì pure West Virginia...
---
What I'm seeing is you have an issue with the player base and not survival mode. It has nothing to do with it and im not seeing a connection.
---
They won‚Äôt do anything, they say they can‚Äôt add anything to people‚Äôs inventory, which I suspect is BS.
---
We have Brahmin
---
You can find a cramburger recipe in The Generals Steakhouse kitchen.
---
Yes, I‚Äôve seen him.
---
Unless they changed it, you sure don‚Äôt get a free set of excavator. You learn how to craft it, and once you craft a full set and register it, you also learn how to make a PA station for your camp. But it takes quite a few materials to craft the full
---
 Set!
---
*crosses my arms and pouts*
---
You have a crystal ball or something?
---
Factions, NPCs, quests, stability.
---
I want a lot of things...
---
Ooooo thanks for letting me know.
---
In 800 hours the only "perfect" roll drop I've gotten was a furious swingspeed +str sledgehammer
---
Does the ultracite gatling really do alot of damage to the queen? I don't think I have a good enough weapon and don't do enough damage. I have been looking around for it too but I'm on xbox
---
Damn you're right. Thanks!
---
They‚Äôre still pretty much the best overall if you aren‚Äôt running a low health build. Instigating is better if you can achieve consistent oneshot status with it, that‚Äôs about it.
---
Hello?
---
Here I thought my hoarding is bad but I see people with 3 characters specifically for carrying junk. This is a gateway to earning a outrageous amount of caps if the conditions are right.
---
It‚Äôs a more extreme version of accidentally drinking toilet water
---
No worries :)
---
Gt is the same, message on xbox if you need it
---
You can get like x4-8 diluted with 2 purified water and a normal stim with the appropriate perks. Running around with almost 200.
---
It‚Äôs just frustrating bc I‚Äôve wasted all this time on something that‚Äôs purely cosmetic. Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if I log on tomorrow and it‚Äôs on sale in the atom shop for 1500 atoms
---
There broken till hopefully Tuesday. Another glitch.
---
It will most likely come to the pass, but not for a while.
---
Ok. But you are going to be changing his litter box!!!
---
Hes pro flesh eating!!!!
---
The RNGods know what you do when your alone...
---
One hangar alone has 3 med kits, 1 medicine cabinet and a doctor's bag as well as a stimpac sitting on the counter.
---
Ahhh hahahah
---
I have not gotten a DC in FO76 in maybe a month. Are you talking about crashes?
---
You could call the event "I'd like to make the world a Nuka."
---
If you are where I think you are, down by the pond and little stream, then your base is in a spot that get high level spawns. There are robots near a hole in the fence and get overwhelmed by max level Ghouls and Super Mutants all the time, once they're dead they will turn on your CAMP. That place also gets the occasional (sometimes 2) Scorched Beasts. If there are players near by causing it to spawn it brings with it several Scorched as well.
---
I had a base there for almost 2 months and it was never griefed but constantly destroyed by Super Mutants and Scorched Beast's sonic and acid attacks. There's nothing you can do about it if you are indeed by the water on the actual course.
---
how else was I supposed to show I was using the sitting pose
---
Only the strong survive
---
Press A
---
That could work. It seems like the fix just switched the problem. Lol. Maybe walking in the circle intitiates pvp but if you kill the owner you still have to claim at the bench. Idk
---
So umm, what did he taste like?
---
I'm reaching 240 on main and have 10 or so level ups unfilled. You can do it all, heavy, melee, ranged, crafting. Jack of all trades is the way to go. The bad thing about high level is pvp you pay more (or used to). So it wasn't a bad idea to make a specialized build that was low level. Now it doesn't matter too much, everybody pve in pvp.
---
The switching comes natural after awhile, a lot of cards to move but once you know your builds well, it goes pretty fast. Like a nuke event usually excavator into prime with weight perks, then switch to x01 and heavy build while the nuke is inbound. Then back to weight perks and stealth melee for farming. I'll do stealth ranged in the same build for mobs in the distance but it saves a lot of ammo using melee.
---
Stealth bloodied is on another level. You can one hit anything in pve including scorchbeasts. It's so op but trade off is you're kind of glass cannonish depending on equipment.
---
Cheers :)
---
Once I got to higher levels and the game was a little less challenging, I discovered the fun of building CAMPS and giving new players cool stuff.
---
Rammed auto correct I meant Jack not lack
---
yeah, this workshop nerf came around a while back.  Griefers were super psyched that they didn't have to break through barricades and shit to use peoples own defenses to murder them anymore.
---
This has been happening to me for a couple months.  Not every nuke though.
---
Most drops are crap. Just farm horde events, uranium fever, and awol armaments. You'll get something decent eventually
---
Calling it a "Lack of all trades" might be more fitting than "Jack of all trades"...
---
Yes glass walls and plots that can grow crops. So I can have a neat indoor green house
---
Do you have pack rat lvl 3 equipped?
---
Instigating
---
I found this through google, that indeed did it. Thanks dude.
---
I thought the clean version was only "clean" for an hour? Or something like that. That's what Class Freak is for.
---
That's a really fun idea, and I love the way your C.A.M.P. turned out.  How hard was it to recreate?
---
yes please amen :prayer:
---
Maybe 10 runs here. Never crashed, but frame rate drops sometimes if people are going nuts with explosives.
---
Glad somebody said that out loud... I thought the same and figured I was being a little OCD.
---
Lol it's all about making the game more enjoyable and rewarding for players that take part in taking down legendary enemies.    And if it just takes one hit to kill them.   And the other 5 players aren't quick enough, what's the point.   So this is actually about everyone.   It would be very beneficial to everyone.   And I'm sure some people would milk it and not help, but at least everyone would benefit.   I guess we will see what happens.  But one can hope!  :)
---
Yeah I think the Whitesprings busts would make for a good Haunted Mansion vibe !!
---
Pocketed uses less resources, and is usually easier to craft. If you don't use VATS, the +5 lbs helps alot.
---
I do the same area, but in the first aid box out front.
---
hey what plat are you on?
---
If they made PvP optional for contested workshops, I would take workshops every time I play.  Some of those times when someone contests one, I would give it up without a fight.  Other times when I'm not right in the middle of something else I want to do, I'd give PvP a try and defend the workshop.
---
Because of the way the workshop PvP is right now, I rarely take over workshops.
---
If they took out the being killed with no warning aspect of it, I'd PvP way more than I do now.  (I do PvP almost zero now.)
---
I know a lot more people would give PvP a try if they were given it as a choice to defend a workshop or abandon it to the challenger than are willing to try it in the current form.
---
Like a Super Mutant could fit in a Dodge Dakota.
---
Lighter armour means less sound it makes. Where as pocketed/deep is just a boost to carry. And if not mistaken lighter gives ap
---
It IS new because this ISN'T just the diseased tag overwriting things.  Absolutely plain enemies with zero tags, legendary or diseased, have been regularly dropping legendary weapons ever since the last patch.
---
Update - I got it! üòÅ
---
Hits like a truck! But now having a bloodied gauss I find this one more convenient as it is silenced and the railway rifle is pretty noisy.
---
Just jump/run away from melee range. It's energy attacks are much weaker. If he is invisible, jump on something or keep moving.
---
yup
---
Weird. I grabbed 40+ violet flux from raydodendrons around the clubhouse with no active nuke.
---
God I hope so.
---
I'm honestly wondering if that "meal" was my character :)  White Wolf hat with Starlet Sniper clothes? Held the pylons like a champ?
---
Happen to know of any fix such as altering the nuke placement? Or does it sort of randomly occur?
---
All it does is eliminate or reduce a whole armor piece weight amount (big picture wise) not really solves the core +5 thing.
---
Shit! Fluorescent, not violet.
---
I had it at one time... some metal armor that‚Äôs craftable with an Atom Store paint.
---
...ok, I stand corrected. And that's fascinating. A common bug for others I haven't seen yet! Usually it's the other way round.
---
I've seen that episode of Hotel Hell.  I feel really bad for the owner... she was clearly overwhelmed and needed help to get her back in the right place, economically and mentally.
---
You realize the absence of evidence IS NOT evidence of absence right?  Your shit luck at having seen it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  While ON THE OTHER HAND people have been repeatedly posting about getting normal enemies all over the place dropping legendary gear and I myself have been seeing them while I farm at the EMS in Watoga.
---
Im not regret playing this game for the first time since release by seeing stuff like this
---
I killed 60+ robots 2 nights ago in Watoga and didn't see a SINGLE legendary, and I looted every single one. Don't tell me that shit ain't broke.
---
I don‚Äôt know, anti-armor could be pretty useful on it. Especially as a possible third perk hypothetically speaking.
---
Vegetable starch
---
You da real mvp
---
And they each earn you building plans
---
True but. 5 more AP plus 1 or 2 lb less is kinda worth more (lack of a better way to put this) gold wise (league of legends reference). Stat efficiency in other words.
---
I'm, both excited we're getting and actual dungeon and concerned that the loot will be as RNG based as fighting the Encryptid or any Multi-Star Legendary for that matter.
---
I completed distant thunder and didn‚Äôt get the completed message for a half hour last night. By then I‚Äôd actually forgotten i did it
---
Okay but like that's one of the very few uses and once you have like 13 bulk adhesive you'll like never need it again.
---
Thanks! Dealing with the limits of the CAMP system can be frustrating, but that's also what makes it kind of fun to see what you can pull off. This used up the entire camp budget, and I had to rebuild the entire thing once over because I tried to transfer it from a more open spot in the Forest, and I couldn't blueprint it, and then the structure didn't fit as built, so I had to scrap it! üò≠
---
Yeah... so I'm going to start leaving Fallout Style reviews on Trip Advisor.
---
Yay!
---
r/brandnewsentance
---
I would say so. I've used one since the beta.
---
Sixty robots!  Wow!  That's an absolutely horrible sample size... congratulations?  Random spawns are random, you having a shit evening isn't evidence of Bethesda secretly fucking with the game for the sake of fucking with the game.
---
I know. Might just be a play style thing.
---
&gt; However while the glow and the name change aren't happening the enemies are STILL gaining a legendary loot pool.
---
Is this why I get tons of legendary items from killing non-legendary enemies at Whitesprings Golf Club?
---
There's a Snoopy easter egg real close to Vault 76
---
Clearly you didn‚Äôt go to my high school.
---
Haha. Thanks XD. I was a bit slack last week so I thought I'd be as quick as I could this week. Pls let me know if you have an issues though, solving them this quick means I haven't tested them yet. Although I'm already seeing these on nukacrypt and someone just launched a nuke on my server from charlie silo so.... yay!
---
Oh yes, I've had that happen as well... my sympathies.  I'm glad you persisted and rebuilt!
---
  Fuck it. Good on you for attempting to help one of your fellow vault dwellers out. 
---
  First, (and ONLY) time I tried that event, I resuscitated a half dozen other players and died three times while some of the same jackasses ran past me while I was down.     
---
  Whole thing reminded me why I gave up playing online back in the early days of CoD. If it ain't the shitty servers giving to you dry, it's your fellow man..
---
i am willing to wait
---
Meh I would buff pocketed/deep by 2 or 3 points to incorporate that increase weight feeling instead of it mitigating the armor's  weight itself.
---
We seem to live in a day and age where there are a ludicrously large amount of people that would trust the companies that have everything to gain from lying to them rather than their fellow consumers that want to see the product be it‚Äôs best and benefit everyone.
---
There is no ‚Äúif‚Äù it happens because it WILL happen if we allow this to pass. The people arguing against this are either the people I mentioned (i.e. fanboys) or extremely naive consumers with little to no experience with the triple A industry.
---
They can be ok but you‚Äôll never be great because you‚Äôre spread out to much. Your best bet is to pick either strength or perception for your primary damage and then agility. Intelligence in my opinion should never be above 5. Luck can have 5 unless you want a little more out of the build. Then do 8. Charisma is pointless with all of the charisma armor, drugs and alcohol.
---
Don't forget SuperDuper.
---
Past few I've come across have been 5%. Didn't even bother picking them up.
---
Late may I believe
---
The Whitesprings golf club has always had a similar issue, but those ghouls are kind of messed up in general at times so it's probably a slightly different bug or something that's just recently started affecting enemies all over the map.
---
Maybe the 1 of 8 different poses every single person is in after petrification are required. Animals can't pose that way. That explains why everyone is in the same pose and why no animals exist. It makes to much sense to not be true.
---
Probably on drugs.

I can buy it for you for cheap. My charisma is around 13 plus add 9 with hard bargain. I'm on Xbox if you are interested. Not looking to make a profit. Just trying to give you the cheapest option.
---
After sheepsquatch I'd be wary to run it with 2 players lol Adding Invulnerability to the new boss is new for fallout! I wouldn't be surprised if they throw us more curve balls!
---
U will not maximize damage for any particular build..id say no
---
There‚Äôs more tapes on him but we‚Äôre cut from the final game. But they are still in the files. So maybe there is a dlc coming with them included.
---
With 1/6th of the entire possible server population already allowed in a group I don't think dealing with friendly fire from a second coordinated group is too much of an obstacle. Don't use explosive guns, learn to aim, whatever. How many would be enough, do you want to have a majority of the server population gang banging the rest? It's more than fine as it is especially with I can't get enough people in my group to swarm people as a reason. Deal with friendly fire or stop being a bitch with 2 groups.
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs not a sure thing, so I haven‚Äôt seen picked it up yet.
---
What vender do they spawn? Cause I can make ultravite fusion cores so I need this
---
How u know this
---
There‚Äôs video on yt
---
Here's hoping the mods actually enforce their own spoiler policies!
---
Oh.
---
If you move over to the lake and stay on the side opposite the river you'll less problems. You'll still get Mirelark spawns though.
---
Closest water is north of WS Train Station. Follow the road where the rail road crosses over the road between the waste disposal site and the train yard. There's water under the bridge, pretty sure you can camp there.
---
Bloody build. I don't ever need a full stim. Hardly use them anyway. I think between my mules I have over 400. Probably closer to 500 Stims. Ive ever only used the diluted
---
I'm waiting for the ability to use stash items to decorate our CAMPs. Is that coming soon?

There's a lack of Passion Fruit in West Virginia. I'd notice the difference in the taste.
---
Not having the most effective means of dealing damage auto target those we don't wish it to target.  Seems fine to me.
---
The other comments so far seem to be leading you in an advanced direction. Let me bridge the gap between what you have done so far and what they are saying:
---
If you have any generator plans whatsoever, you have enough to power your base. The pylon and power connector items come standard; you don't need to find those. Some of the more advanced things, sure, but you don't *need* them. Also, the fusion generator provides 100 power... this is enough for pretty much everything. If you're going basic you don't need that kind of power, but if you have the resources for the F.G., why not?
---
The idea is simple - some things require an actual amount of power, such as resource collectors, water purifiers, and some turrets. These will generally have a connector spike of sorts to connect them to your generators with wire. If you have 10 power provided and you set up a purifier that takes 8, you have 2 power surplus to use elsewhere.
---
Things like lights just generally need to be near power but don't take up supply. These items are powered by connectors that go on walls, ceilings, or floors. The pylon is one of these, but there is another set of 3 that attach to things other than the ground. You run a wire from the generator to the connector, and if the connector is close enough to the light it will light up. 
---
You can string pylons or connectors together to span long distances.
---
thank you
---
Man I hate it when they share rad sponge. Messes.my entire game up when fighting the Queen. Most of the time I have to leave their team.
---
23rd of May

If you're not looking to use this character to pvp, or to fight much at all really, then a well rounded character who knows a bit of this and that (Jack of all Trades) can be fun to play. I tend to do this kind of build a lot in games as I like to be able to do a bit of everything. If my friends need a hacker. Boom, I got the cards. Need a lock picked? Boom, I got that too. Need some armor made? If I got the plans, I got the skills. I do suggest, however, that you get good with a sniper. The reason being is because if you're gonna focus on putting points here and there and take this and that perk, you probably won't focus too much on maxing out all your weapon skills and perks so you may be bit squishy mano y mano, so sniping enemies before you approach may be your safest bet. I know that's easier said than done with some enemies, which is why it's only a suggestion. I love sniping so it's what I did with my build. It took me awhile, but I've managed to snipe a level 68 Deatclaw before I got anywhere near it. I just love the thrill of the kill without the enemy even knowing I'm there, LoL. Unless I'm with my friends, who are more gun-ho than I, my sniper is my best friend. Good luck.
---
The Late One. 
---
I made a post about how we are always late. If you look at some of the bodies around the map they look to be in really good condition for being years old in a land filled with creatures that ya know eat meat. 
---
And some of the random encounters have traders and merchants that look days and weeks old. So my guess it that we literally just missed these people being alive. As there really ARE people in the world space and we just miss them because we are perpetually never on time.
---
Not a fan of uranium fever. Tops out at lvl 40 gear.
---
I ain't trying to be a smart *** ..but why not fight them yourself and figure things out? Like trial and error..its much more rewarding that way
---
looks like the enclave urban operative chest and heavy marine legs w/ deep pockets
---
The only problem I see with this, is when people are playing the story and listening to the brotherhoods downfall told from a now-recreated Fort Defiance. Actually now that I type it... it would be pretty cool to hear it and look around at what it's become now :) ugh the potential is real
---
I've been having this issue as well on ps4
---
Anytime really. You can solo the entire main story (except the Queen, but it's not hard to get help for it), and you'll be around level 50 by the time you finish it. Also depending on what exactly you want to respec into it might take less time to grind with your existing character. Even at high levels you can rack up that xp by clearing Whitesprings and West-Tek.
---
Fantastic theory. Always late is a good specialty in the wasteland. You don't end up like those bodies.
---
I read your post! It was very interesting, thank you! It almost seems... perfectly fallout poetic to be the people to retake america, days, maybe weeks after the tragedies of the appalachian wasteland
---
True. I mean more for selling/trading. I've gotten a few sentinel/cavalier pieces out of there that sold for a good buck.
---
nah my left mut fruit is though. heh.
---
This. I only join nukes where I can utilize my bloody build without having to worry about rads. That being said, she melts with a few heavy gunners using a bloody build.
---
Wow, you seem stable.
---
As in it Keeps saying "server not responding:  controls have been temporarily disabled" followed by "disconnected from server" and kicks me to the main menu.  There were crashes but right now its just this.
---
When a donkey and a horse love each other very much...
---
Fair. But everyone in that family has some sort of fetish or something that gives them a quirk. The daughter is into BDSM or some form of it. The brothers are deep into business and rage/weapons respectively. Mom is like the son and deep into business. The husband seems to be really passive. As he never does anything to quell the families issues. And you have issac and his sloths. I‚Äôd bet he‚Äôs on some form of a drug. My guess is day tripper
---
I kno u are not on PS4..I was only part of a failed event once
---
Real ogs rmemeber when you could walk into white spring at level 12 and not being raped to oblvion
---
Thanks.
---
Technically correct. The best kind of correct.
---
What time will the servers go down
---
If your on xbox im pretty sure it was ME LOOL ü§£ü§£
---
A friend is very helpful when transferring between characters. That's the easy way.
---
The other way I'm not fond of is find a spot in the map people dont go to, stash junk there, exit game return to world with other character. Chances of stuff being gone frightens me
---
and bad in a sense.
---
The snaptails also do not change during a nuke, or they do and can't be picked up. My base is right next to the ones North of the clubhouse at WhiteSprings, id love some easy violet flux but the game has other ideas
---
Uh, I've never used discord. I've heard some horror stories tho.
---
Plus we were literally late leaving the vault! üòÇ
---
Remember the "where dey at doe" clip?  That was from Beckley.
---
Look at this guy, able to go into whitesprings without dying. 
---
I can't wait until I can go in there and actually loot instead of getting that sword in a panic and running. Only 34 at the moment though.
---
Yeah bro some guy came over to me. Got down in the crouch position and just ate me. I was laughing my ass off
---
Doesn't the server hop when you leave?
---
I have high Strength, Perception, Agility and Intelligence at the expense of Charisma and Endurance. It affords me a lot of versatility in my build without sacrificing too much. I can go stealth sniper or commando, heavy weapons and PA, all varieties of melee... The only thing I can't do efficiently are hand guns, which is fine by me.
---
I don‚Äôt think we are late leaving. If Fo3 the terminal says the vault was meant to open 20 years. But here we leave 25. Either that was a lie for the masses. As MODUS says in the bunker ‚Äúyou vault dwellers are rather cunning‚Äù or something like that. To me that makes me think we are meant to join and form the enclave we see in the future.
---
I‚Äôm so excited!! I‚Äôve been waiting for this for a while and I‚Äôm curious to see the backstory on it!
---
*Nocturnal board*
---
Oh, I iust meant we're the last out cause we overslept.
---
Probably fixed soon as it's a pretty big thing.
---
Oh. Yep.
---
If you click on recent list and click on a person you can join back in the world
---
60 robots! and zero legendaries! When normally I get at least 10 legendaries! wow! 
---
If you count my week total it's probably more like 200+ robots! But I didn't actually count those! So I just did the ones I mentally counted the other night! Because I don't know exactly how many robots I kill in a week! omg! Maybe it's like 400? I don't know! omg! w0w!
---
And I'm not the only one! wow! fucking fuck fuck fuck! wow!
---
For the record, I don't think Bethesda did this on purpose, just like I don't think they broke modding weapons and armor on purpose, or fucked up bobby pin weight, or when they made it so repair info disappears when you repair something. Other people are reporting getting a 99% Legendary rate in other instances. I don't think Bethesda did that on purpose either. But I DO think something was messed up. 
---
Bringing it up isn't some attack on Bethesda. You can sleep ok knowing not everyone that brings up things that ARE happening are an attack on Bethesda. 
---
We report what we ARE finding, so that Bethesda can be aware of it. We are also fans of the game. I've have 600+ hours into it. I'm not sitting here bitching for the sake of hate. I'm posting what I have found, so if Bethesda reads these threads, they can see that numerous people are having the same issue. 
---
&lt;3
---
I wonder how many negative reviews are just to draw clicks, and not from people that have actually played the game? The game is still fun to me. It‚Äôs one of my favorite perks of retirement... no job to interfere with game time. It‚Äôs almost worth getting old. Not quite, but almost.
---
Confession: I did this a couple months back but intentionally. I really wanted the guy's junk because he picked up some acid and I was trying to mass craft flamer fuel at the time because the production rate is so garbage even with ammosmith.
---
Yeah was playing today and some nice chap gave me a full set of t60 pa while i was at the firebreathers hq.
---
I love the Encrypted event because I pick up everyone's lunch bags
---
You mean a random person can be your ticket back in? Or they have to be friend listted?
---
That‚Äôs why you need to have a friend you can join the same world between the characters you want to transfer items to and fro. The friend doesn‚Äôt need to be involved. U just need to join friend world and stash items in world container like a suitcase or something. Then switch over to another character account and then join same friend world. Ideally, u should Pre plan this move by making sure your characters involved are in the same spot where the world container you will transfers the items into and take out. I do this all the time. Just need a friend who doesn‚Äôt server hop. Hahaha. Or asking the friend to hold the items itself and then switch toons and get items from friend. Much safer route.
---
I'm more worried about what breaks to compensate for it. :|
---
All the time.  I still laugh also
---
underrated comment
---
I cant play right now man but add me Wildcatfriend6 i got 3 charactere one lv46 one lv 11 and one lv63 so i can adapt to what you wanna do :p
---
Robot vendor in pleasant valley ski resort has all the raider plans
---
Yup definitely awesome finishing off another player by cannibalization
---
Usually she goes down to half and then regens. Shoddy luck for you
---
Typically they go for about 25k a piece - thats 100k a set, trade only worth of similar gear. You won't find these available for caps as people can't hold that amount even with 4 mule characters.
---
Sounds about right.
---
I've spent upwards of a few hours in one build session, customizing my place lol
---
throw a grenade in the waterfall room, the wendigo will drop down.
---
It's a pretty common bug, someone had their mutton spawn by accident on a different animal too.
---
Dude, the only incorrect amount of time is not enough
---
That poor guy is always never not dead.
---
I have spent a lot of time on my camp. I have made 4 or 5 camps. Each one is bigger then the last
---
In spite of the Sheedsquatch event requiring 2,000 caps to start and the cooldown. Nevermind dying and possibly losing your junk because why not. 
---
The Fasnacht Parade event was better because the timer was an hour and the bugs were tolerable. The rewards were appropriate because some included CAMP items. Not sure if people can find the headmounts from the main quest or side quests for Sheepsquatch.
---
On the other hand, what I'm looking forward in tomorrow's patch is a fix for mods installed on gear.
---
First time I seen that I was drawn to the eyes.  Then I figured out what it was
---
I've spent hours getting my camp just right... Just need some more budget though! I have a tiny silver left which I'm hoping beyond hope will be enough to squeeze that vending machine in when it finally gets here.
---
I'll check my inventory tonight (AEST), but I think I have some raider armour plans that I don't need if you're on XBox?
---
Damn, no I'm on ps4 
---
Thank you anyways though!
---
How you get this info? Isn't it random
---
I feel this will be a thing though, after the dungeon release
---
I usually just do the breach and clear event whenever is pops up.
---
I usually net 200-300 lead and steel. And around 20-50 of all the other metals
---
Did some unscientific testing and it seemed like three was optimal and made it‚Äôs possible to drop action boy.
---
The 4th and forth pieces provided a negligible benefit.
---
Ahh, bummer dude.
---
Well, I can say that most of those plans I found through the treasure maps if that helps any?
---
The sheer amount of times I've listened to A-list actors pull out their best Boston accent as made me immune to caring about such things.
---
Back in beta I had one alive try to sell me human bones. But after backing out and not buying it got hostile. Sadly they died. Wish I got pictures of the moment.
---
For real....well the clock struck 12 and I finally just rounded a corner right into one. Well I will take note of that waterfall trick.
---
This has to be the most frustrating game to play still....the only enjoyment i get is doing the missions and making boozes.
---
Ty for info just wanted to make sure , cause I remember seeing somewhere on here before but I forgot the cap
---
The problem with regular enemies becoming legendary mid fight, is that if you drop them before they can recover, they'd never become legendary. So it would be punishing alpha strikes on enemies.
---
It's been happening for a couple months
---
spawn at abbys bunker and walk south down the road you will always find one there
---
At that point I'll sell one of my turrets or tv/couch
---
It needs to be in the cave
---
My pitchfork was sharp as fuck and to save time I set it on fire and left the torch at home until the idea of things despawning to meet the lower player's needs.
---
I'm level 35 and right now almost all of my quest have someone level 100+ running around spawning level 68 super mutants and glowing charred ghouls. I can't do anything. Fighting a single level 68 mutey takes all my ammo and breaks several of my pieces of armor, and there's always more than one. 
---
This idea would not only make things a little more varied for high levels, it could actually help the lower levels getting outzoned by higher level players. They'd have to be very smart about how they implemented this and which zones had it.
---
Goin' down is history!
---
This is how games use to be. You had to write stuff down IRL and actually read everything and know what is going on, no map markers, no quest circles, no illuminating lines for directions.
---
Sometimes that‚Äôs the case, the game engine even toss them like rag dolls if an explosion happened before. Sometimes it‚Äôs just weird when a ghoul or a robot is walking fine then all of a sudden it just collapsed as if yoda crushed its windpipe. I‚Äôve only seen ghouls and robots doing this, never a super mutant or gutsys.
---
/u/sorry_i_reddit_wrong did the testing can ask hi for more info.

When I was new to the game I came across a town with super mutants and I was battling them with my rifle. As I was new, I was on the verge of death. Thenn two dudes came out of no where, one in power armor the other in a grease jackets taking out mutants left and right. In my awe failed to  pay attention to what I was doing and I was downed by a stray bullet.
---
The greaser jacket guy was like "AH SHIT I'LL SAVE YOU" and ran over to me. He proceeded to cannibalize my corpse killing me by accident. As my screen faded I heard over the voice chat.
---
"AH FUCK NIGEL YOU AINT SUPPOSED TO EAT THEM U DIPSHIT"
---
I may have lost a bunch of my junk but my God was that one of the best moments I ever had in a video game.
---
Myself and multiple members of my Fallout 76 FB group have been experiencing a problem attaching some mods to melee weapons. This problem started following this most recent patch.
---
Lol
---
I want to display my teddy bears. üêª

That would be so great.
---
gamma heals bloated

this a million times this. this is crucial.

Yes
---
It just takes the place of all your armor, right? Yeah that sucks.
---
Listen. Numbers and facts don't matter to these chuckleheads.
---
They all went to the University of "Every one knows...." 
---
Where they put far more credence to their individual anecdotal evidence and the anecdotal evidence of others who agree with them.

If you have opposing anecdotal evidence, actual facts, data etc you're just a BGS fanboi who can't see what the man behind the curtain is actually doing
---
Radiation guns exist?
---
If one takes -4 strength another takes another-4
---
I'm down, tag is Th4tsFakeNews lvl 106 don't worry about holding me back or anything I mostly just wander around and collect things of interest. I will be online on Sunday the 21st at around 3pm Pacific. Ready to do the new Burrows dungeon if anyone is interested
---
it's bugged and needs to be fixed, as well as a damage buff.
---
power armor or regular armor?
---
That's the spirit!
---
This is the adrenaline i've been looking for and it's going to get even better.
---
Regular armor
---
If one takes -4 strength another takes another 4- strength
---
I love that place!
---
It used to always spawn right away for me, but today I hopped about 5 times and no wendigo, I figured I'd try something different. It only spawned after I threw a grenade, tried it 2 more times, same results.
---
That would stack to -8 strength yes
---
Funnily enough this is my first fallout game and the only other Bethesda game I played was skyrim
---
Ok thanks
---
And taxation is theft, and you pay no taxes to government bureaucrats here
---
Hahah, nice. 
---
Question about the balloons behind the brown chair, are they the same as the ones on the table, or something? They look like they're not tethered the same? It almost looks like they're attached to the back of the chair.
---
You're saying I can easily get my Excavator PA mods even without a nuke? I gotta get there fast
---
If you don‚Äôt have a friend to help you I would recommend using a mod/middle man from this group they are trusted people
---
The only plan I've ever gotten or seen was a reward from the One Violent Night even in the Divide. I think the plans are rare drops from events in the divide, since that's the "raider" region.
---
Don't post this on Reddit and ruin a system all of us need.  Delete this post. Shut up and be happy that this is the last untapped system in this game. When someone asks this you say I don't know.
---
Add phat dastard, I'll play with you anytime.  I'm a native speaker but my English ain't so good neither lol
---
Bos officer unform
---
Most people use a low level alt to use as a mule, so he was probably just selling from the mule. 
---
And you're not going to be banned for having duped stuff, as others have said, unless you have a LOT of the stuff.
---
Basically this right here. 
---
A lot of people complaining about the current limit are not thinking long term. Beth paid millions in fees fighting Interplay to get the rights to do an online FO. This game will be around for years(personally I can't imagine it closed in less than 10 years). Over that time the cap limit will inevitably be raised multiple times.  However every time they do raise the cap, so to will rise the price of the best goods.  They have to start will a smaller cap cap or everything will cost a million caps a year or 2 from now.
---
That's the beauty of this game.
---
Ok that makes sense.   Seems like where I‚Äôm heading in a way.  I‚Äôm a 110 or so.  I‚Äôm a tse shotgun and tse handmade build but have a lot of one hand melee perks.  I guess my constant is PA.  I‚Äôm changing cards pretty often which was annoying at first but I‚Äôm used to it.   
---
It seems that a lot of guys have an aversion to PA.  Seems like such an awesome tool and force multiplier I can‚Äôt see not using it.  Then again it‚Äôs a game that one can play with so why not try a non PA build.  Gives me good points to think on thanks guys.
---
thats why I hate whitesprings one star pradise and 2 hours of invnetory management after a day noty.
---
It may not be a guaranteed 2x craft, but it seems to activate a lot more than you think it would. You should definitely consider getting it
---
Great patch ü§ô
---
I don't think it can put you below 0 of any stat tho.
---
Remember it‚Äôs an online game, play online trade with other players. Part of the experience guarantee you‚Äôll find a stronger weapon.
---
I mean, with a bloodied lever action, fully Unyielding setup, I don't really care about close quarters fighting. Gun Fu, Lever Action, Head Shots means I can chain 5 headshot kills in 5 seconds from a full mag. And that's if they even detect me in the first place. 30+ agility adds a lot of stealth bonus, plus all the stealth perks.
---
Thanks man!
---
I had the same thing happen to me the other day. I fast traveled to Harper's Ferry because I wanted to listen to that *Smooth Voice,* and found two legendary Ghouls just standing there. I decided to do a full lap around the area, and ended up finding a total of 9 legendary Ghouls. Everything on them was crap, but at least it was good cap fodder.
---
No problem
---
You don‚Äôt have to unequip starched genes do use the serums
---
Except you can already use weight reduction on your character, if you use them all you can carry WAY more than your stash can hold.
---
A simple control, would be to prevent you from removing a stash perk that would put you over the default weight limit. So you would have to sort that out first.
---
I like the aura ideas, having CAMP items that provide an area of effect.
---
You can go to the status tab of your Pipboy and in the SPECIAL tab it will tell you your current amounts
---
I dunno you could make a pretty decent jack of trades going high luck and vats. Doesn't seem to matter what my vats sniper uses a vats crit is always Gunna hurt.
---
Please post this on the XB1 looking for groups page on the official club
---
Even inside a confined space?  A bunker?  I honestly don‚Äôt know your side of a set up.
---
Update, I got one thanks.
---
Lightweight for the pieces I keep in my stash, pockets for my active gear.
---
It does work with bear arms.
---
The pioneer Is a pretty good name
---
That‚Äôs the one - hotel hell. I agree. In a more mature response - I did notice that she seemed to have a very good coping mechanism to deal with that. Complete denial   
---
The landscape in some of the scenes is absolutely beautiful and honestly if I was to travel near by, I would make a visit.
---
Field surgeon, in the charisma tree, makes stims and radaway faster.
---
Whoa, save that!
---
I spent 3 weeks on mine.
---
Confined space isn‚Äôt an issue if they just don‚Äôt detect you. I‚Äôve had a SB literally land on me and I didn‚Äôt leave ‚Äúcaution‚Äù. And even if I do get detected, there‚Äôs very few enemies I can‚Äôt oneshot even when not in stealth. And a lever action fires fast. 
---
The only times I die is when I get surprised from behind by a supermutant/yao Guai powerslamming me in the back. Since I‚Äôve only got about 40 health, and I don‚Äôt run many defensive perks (really just my minimum 1str in Blocker) well, that can hurt.
---
That's pretty good!
---
I want a deathclaw merchant he could work for free states while grum works for walaka city.
---
So if I take the new serum they will stay permanently like the other ones I already have equipped? I just heard of a bug where you had to take serum first then equip starched genes. Just wanted some clarification
---
I had this happen too. So I went through, had to get the second part of the list again, got the stuff, made it, and gave it to BIV and it gave me a quest completion, the quest didn't show up in my log at all through that but it didn't seem to stop me completing it. Hope that helps
---
I already didn't like the bullet sponge enemies, invulnerability runs this game down into acrade type bs even more.
---
I always wondered what happened to my family and friends. They all must have really hated me to leave me drunk in the bunker and never tried to look for me.
---
Based on that we can assume probably all damage buff except the damage perk cards for a weapon type stack multicatively. 
---
Armor and defenses will be much harder to test. You'll have to use other players to test the perks.
---
[It has a perk on it that multiplies the target's DR by *-0.3*](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/399713716184285214/567563628664979476/unknown.png). I presume this is an error and was meant to be *.3*, however since I believe DR has a minimum value of 0 this in essence just nullifies all armor.
---
The perk's ID is `E01B_Encryptid_AssaultronSheepsquatchArmorPenetrationPerk` if anyone else wants to have a look for themselves.
---
Do the enclave events to get all the silo pieces one by one. (8 for each silo) Then you need to get the code word which helps solve the code order. This is either revealed letter by letter in the enclave bunker military wing. Then you need to use the codeword to make an encoded alphabet to organise you silo pieces into the correct order.  
---

Make sure to give  [SaukPuhpet](https://www.reddit.com/user/SaukPuhpet) a like cause he really spent time on making everything easy to understand for the rest of us. Def better then I can explain it. :) Good  luck.
---
Holy shit dude, I think you‚Äôve been running the event with our group!
---
Your saying that Bethesda will ruin this thing also?
---
Well what do you expect when we don't have a collection-post for these?
---
Are we supposed to just shut up instead?
---
I like that he hits hard, but not the invulnerability bs.
---
Illusive? As in deceptive? Or elusive?
---
I love it down there. I have a scavver alt, and once she gets high enough level, her home is gonna be down there.
---
Can't speak for any new bugs but I've done it with starched genes on... that said you could have unequipped and re equipped it like 100+ times in time it took you to write this.
---
I gave away 9 3* legendaries to some rando today because I don't have room for them. They were pretty badass like a bloodied vats crit combat shotgun and some sentinel assassins armors. Just be nice dude if you read this and pay it forward.
---
It happens randomly. Not all the flowers changed and it had all the rampaging glowing ones from a nuke zone but with clear skies and no background rads.
---
Oh you're right! Damn I wish we could edit titles.
---
It shouldn't matter, but if it feels safer unequip the card and use the serums. Then reequip.
---
Yeah, I ended up giving my buddy the speed demon one so we could work together to get the mats.  I'm up to 10 crafted and 3 sold, easily worth the 1500 each for the recipes.  Keep an eye out here for people selling them, you could even try commenting on this post as it was just a couple days ago.  Seller was straight up, met at the vault, quick and easy.

---
Also one of the new robots added in the White Springs resort sells the plans too....
---
I just made a post, I am fairly certain that it was only Watoga that got the nerf. I just spent all night cataloguing it  Can you say you have gotten a legendary there in the last week?
---
Thanks. Just wanted to know what the safer one would be.
---
Not really! It makes the fights more dynamic instead of stand and shoot! The sad thing is the sheepsquatch event tells you everything you need to know on screen  and everyone was still confused! Lol
---
I‚Äôve taken serums with starched genes
---
It works lol
---
But I definitely unequiped starched genes my first time
---
I get money like 99% of the time, and very rarely something else.
---
Thanks. I was insulted multiple times for saying it was nerfed along with confirming I farm watoga a ton. I didn't act rude or disrespectful at all. Thank you for this information. I hope the naysayers choke on it for a good long time.
---
Wow thanks! I read everything lol
---
I know most ppl just tell me to play the game and have fun and I‚Äôll pick things up as i go but last thing i want is have a crappy build after investing so much time
---
I just did 400 over 20 server hops and not a single one. Dude is being a condescending ass to you.  Other places have been normal but anyone saying g they are getting consistent  legendary bots out of Watoga right now is lying. It was absolutely nerfed.
---
Just having a little fun. Actually, illusive could work depending on the context. "He said he was going to sell me a 3 star legendary but he offered a nocturnal wood left leg instead. He was being illusive. So I killed him."
---
Levels pass quickly, you'll be 50+, 100+ before you know it.
---
If you're on PC and you're not a douchebag I'll team up
---
Yes please Bethesda. Especially galling when I have to read it because your server crashed. Again.
---
If I had even gotten a single legendary I would have kept going another 20 runs but this is just way too far off.
---
I really want to believe your username is "Amy Louw 'Hot Hats' who?", Hot Hats is a great nickname and this sounds like a killer knock knock joke.
---

\+5 lbs don't matter much if you are having no trouble managing your carry weight. Some people just ignore all junks

I dunno, seems appropriately rated for the sub were in and time it‚Äôs been posted.
---
Some people are buying a second copy of the game ( I saw them as low as 10‚Ç¨) and make a second account just for transferring stuff.
---
I wanna display my Giddy Up Buttercups.
---
I don‚Äôt like the wrapped cap being now incompatible with gas masks and other masks.
---
Hahaha
---
I haven't seen a legendary robot in watoga streets since the patch. I've seen 5 non robots around it, but this is ridiculous. Hopefully it was a glitch rather than fix. It may have been too high of a spawn, but what else do high levels do at end game besides destroy my camp?
---
Hmmm...might have to role play as Hannibal Lecter.
---
O_o it's strange how far people go but yes it seems like a good deal unlimited weight for 10 $ plus extra ps4 cost.

On my way!

It's one of many random encounters I've seen. There is a Mr. Handy one though, that "walks" a bunch of mongrel dogs. So many and they're all pretty fun. My fave is probably the panicky Mr. Handy that thinks he's about to explode.
---
I admire the effort for perfection

It takes you two shots?? Loser! /S

Oh damn that's awesome.

That makes sense stash plus ultra light equals more stash weight left over.

Appropriately rated comment that I enjoyed a lot
---
I am nvr really done though. Today spent a few hours making a fence. üòÇ
---
You don‚Äôt exist says the Xbox.
---
Sounds like you are getting better at it also
---
True art must not be rushed.
---
So wait... you want them to add outfits from 150+ years in the future? Ummm. No. 
---
I'd be fine with something similar but different, but I'd like for them to at least try to keep the timeline consistent!
---
I found a plan for it and used it. I can make it if you're ps4
---
Sounds like your building a skyscraper.
---
It drops from Event completion, not the bot herself. Same as how you get the outfits and hat.
---
What I'm saying is there is a unspoken word about this and also something you don't want many people to know about. There are a million losers and scumbags in this game. Then there are the ones that run it. The ones that use this option run it. The ones that ride two seater bycycles with other men dont. If your a vendor in this game you need this. You dont want prying eyes on the internet seeing stuff like this. Especially people who need recognition through YouTube, Kids with big mouths, Social media, Reddit and other trade forums post. These other people know better than to post something like that on here. They could just PM you and tell you. Yeah Bethesda would not like this even though they know about it. It's the last thing we have left. Now you know. Remove this post. Or PM me your GT and I'll teach you my ways. But absolutely remove these posts.
---
Yep. And part of the reason they shatter is ultracite generates a tremendous amount of heat. The scorched literally burn up from the inside as they crystallize. Thus their name.
---
Underrated comment!
---
Could it possibly be better than my furious combat rifle? I'm kind of a stealth build and I've been intrigued by this....I do have plans, so I could test it..
---
Is an endanger ol stringer
---
It would've been way better if we were from WV and tried to find our family or something.
---
I have mine on a junk node next to a legendary / deathclaw spawn and a power plant substation. Problem being half my defenses shut down everytime I switch servers and that deathclaw is really in love with my genny.
---
this shit made my night i am dying over here lol.
---
Oh, it happens all the time, ask any EMT!
---
I feel like glass walls and indoor/outdoor planters would be amazing
---
If i am not mistaken, scorched is virus that need energy to live, thats why scorched people have ultracite parts in their bodies. As soon as ultracite lose its energy, scorched turns into petrified corpse.
---
&gt;"oh guess we'll lose AWOL 
---
I did AWOL the other day, only legendary was the 3\* at the end for the boss....When I did it a month ago, there was at least 4-5 2-3 Legendary Gutsys..
---
Oh
---
More you know...
---
You‚Äôre welcome!
---
They are right in playing your way and having fun, but like any RPG planning your build/play style can keep you from doing tedious and boring stuff later on. 
---
I hit 115 and I‚Äôd have to level to 157 to fix it for my build. I have no quests except for dailies and events left. Which gets boring so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm redoing a new character but the same build. Hopefully my advice can somewhat prevent you from hopping in the same boat as me. Before redoing my tank I tried doing a rifle based alt, hit lvl 25, and realized I really like having large ammo mags and laying down bullets instead of semi-auto rifles. 
---
The game kind of has respeccing but it‚Äôs slow so getting the build you want by lvl 50, or setting up specials for it is a big deal imo. After level 50 whenever you level up you can move a special point OR pick a new perk card. Eventually you‚Äôll get all perk cards, but specials is where you want to focus. Pick these based on number of perk cards needed, not the bonus they give.
---
I also forgot to mention, most perks related to heavy weapons you can‚Äôt get till lvl 30-50, so what I‚Äôm doing is a shotgunner until lvl 30. Then by lvl 60 I‚Äôll replace all shotgun related perks with heavy weapon perks since they go under the same special. Could be done with 1 or 2h melee too. Also, if you go heavy, they use decent amounts of ammo which isn‚Äôt a big deal after 50, but can be bad for under 50. Find a good spot for farming lead, steel, and gunpowder and you‚Äôll be alright.
---
Yes. Unlike in previous games releases, the Gamma Gun has a ballistic component to its damage.  This damage can indeed be used to kill things that are otherwise immune from radiation. 
---
Unlike in FO4, radiation dealt to ghouls will in fact heal them. I know one issue in FO4 was with legendaries and the Radium rifle. Basically it gave them rad damage and blocked them from healing back to full health. I checked on this very early in FO76 and found that the Gamma and Radium guns heal ghouls.
---
The hardest part to me is starting without a prebuilt neutral house.
---
Thanks I'll try what you did and see if that would work. I'll update this reply if it's works or not, for me.
---
There is the overseers camp. But its not very fashionable.
---
There are many other posts that say about this also that's how I found out the phrase.
---
You might want to reconsider your build. I run low health build and I do close to 2k damage with my fatman and since it's two shot, it's more like 4k per nuke. In terms of damage, I have no problem at all with these weapons. Durability might be an issue but spamming mini nukes don't seem right to me in moral perspective
---
This is odd, for me I have seen FAR more legendary since the last patch. There have been 2 days where I just came across legendary after legendary, only one in the group glowing, but I have seen the glowing almost every time now whereas before it was just occasional. I went to the dump  north of white springs and all 5 super mutants where legendary with the leader being a 3 star. Random  Ghoul spawns with half of them being legendary. Went to westek and got 4 legendary. Its been crazy since the last patch for me. 
---
I see the glowing ones almost every time now.
---
Also there are all those locked houses in whitesprings. I hope one day we can rent rooms.
---
i'm a bit confused on how they worded it in the "Inside The Vault"  how many people can be in the dungeon with you at once?    Is it 2 people only or can you have a 4 man party go in there with you?
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
Maybe have a alternate stash an additional 800 (or less)
---
no its definetly not dead, I can also tell you I have seen and increase off low lvl player rolling around the map.
---
Ps4
---
Unfortunately it does not happen to me. I end up selling whatever 3*drop I get to a vendor since they are usually not useful.
---
I've farmed over a thousand legendary items from Watoga up until that patch, and knew for a fact something changed the day following the update. I've killed a similar number of protectrons (350 or so) the past couple of days, just for the sake of being thorough, and can also say, not one single legendary protectron. 
---
I've gotten plenty of legendary super mutants at other locations, but robots appear to have been nerfed as a class of enemy is my best guess. I speculated it was due to the waves of robots spawning in the sheepsquatch event, they just blanket nerfed robots as legendaries instead of specifically for the event.
---
If you were on PS4, that might have been me lmao, timing definitely lines up. 
---
I was waiting for my teammate to come get me up from across the fight and somebody finished me off by cannibalizing my poor, wounded body. I've never been on the uh... receiving end of that perk before today. The crunch is pretty rough. 
---
Hopefully I was delicious?
---
Thanks for all the help guys.
---
Thanks for confirming this. Very helpful. It‚Äôs a real shame they‚Äôve done this for at least 2 reasons....
---
(1) The grinding to get good legendaries might be the only left thing left for some players to do with the game in between good content being released.
---
(2) Watoga is a great looking place, a lot of work went into the design of it  and now it‚Äôs just feels like it‚Äôs a place to farm aluminium and lead.
---
 
---
I think the chances of something getting done will be very slim :(
---
Yes. Two of them. 
---
Gamma Gun:  A favorite of the Children of Atom in previous releases, it fires a powerful blast of radiation towards the target.  
---
Radium Rifle:   Added in FO4's Far Harbor add on, it primarily deals ballistic damage, however also deals some rads. In FO4 base radiation damage was 50, upgradable to 150 using perks. In FO76 this rad damage is maxed at 15 and is unaffected by perks and mutations.
---
Far harbour had a Yorkshire man üòÇ
---
Best real drop I had was a Bloodied Explosive level 25 Handmade(and that was the other day, I"m level 151)....which I promptly sold as I already had a lvl45 Furious explosive handmade.
---
Just today, I bought a 3\* Furious Ultracite laser, with 50% vats crit damage and +1 perception...Also bought a MSE minigun the other day.....and got a Furious Explosive handmade from a vendor...all my actual 3\* drops that I've kept have been 3\* armour that I've only kept due to the weight reduction perks on them. Vendors are my main source of weapons, lol
---
Same here actually. Never seen so many as post that patch.
---
It's a joke there's too many ways to stop rads they become useless.
---
I found this the other day was pretty cool! I got the wedding ring and then sold it, lol!
---
Amazing work, member.
---
Do you do this on your own or do you have a team that collects and compiles the data?
---
I'd be interested in helping out collect code pieces if this was the case.
---
I seen the Imposter outfit at Enclave bunker the other day, I regret not grabbing it....Only  thing I"m missing, clothing wise and I've got 2 full mascot outfits and like 7 Wolf Fedoras.
---
I have seen way more of the red arua this week.
---
I understand and it drives me crazy as well but it will take the grind off the game away, and then what its a fallout game without the grind.
---
I can say it up to us, I do use a lower attackiing weapon when im doing nuke zones and stuff to give other ppl the chance to tag enemiens if I see them around me. With that not everyone does it and yes it sucks but all you have to do is go in a circle and the enemiens will spawn again. 
---
I have learned and adjusted to the situation, not everyone is going to do that.
---
This only happens if you fire before it finishes the reload cycle. If you pull that trigger before it completes, you get 1 shell only or in rare cases 3. I understand the frustration, but you are interrupting the reload when you pull the trigger
---
Wow, just like every other build, but those builds still surpass the damage a Fatman does with much cheaper resources . I'm talking base outline of these weapons, Any weapon that can be viable if you gimp yourself to the point they one-shot muties, but the point is you shouldn't have to resort to such levels to make a weapon VIABLE. They should be good, but they can get better when you work along with it. These launchers don't, even when you make a perk build around it, you still have to go out of your way to even get good results. It's just like PA unarmed build, you gotta gimp yourself and go out of your way just to be remotely viable.
---
Every time I see someone shilling for that place it sounds more and more restrictive and annoying.
---
You could just roleplay your home. Theres plenty of vacant buildings with little to no lore on them.
---
I think its just one 8f Todd Howards ghost accounts.
---
Its just me and my hubby helps me out if I get overrun by something. (Usually because i forgot to check weapon durability before fumbling my way into the mire after a silo piece. Lol) I'm always happy if people wanna help out. I try and have the new ones up by day 2 at the latest but I got lucky this time.
---
Hello, Mr. 1.0.
---
In my opinion conduit is the best way to go for your C.A.M.P. unless you're going for that moonshine/crack shack look then by all means pile on the pylons!
---
Conduit looks cleaner and there's a miriad of gadgets you can attach to them. I for instance use power radiators for most of my lighting as it doesn't require wires
---
When you do need wires and you're like me and like things clean swap out your floors for the metal grating stuff you can pass wires between floors that way but when your done you can swap the floor back to what you really want and the wire will clip through. Same concept with walls except you turn the wall into a doorway run your wires then turn it back to a wall. Just know if you want to move the connected points you have to swap back to the grating and or doorway.
---
Finaly setting up "circuits". I use the term losely because its more linear logic than a true electrical circuit (you dont run a return line to the generator) terminals are loads of fun they can be used to control light boxes, operate switches, etc which can be useful to say level 3 secure the Red Rocket garage door to your work shop by wiring up the door to a switch on the workshop side of the door and controlling it with a terminal on the outside of the workshop.  But big thing here ORDER MATTERS if you go [PowerSource]-&gt;[Switch]-&gt;[Terminal]-&gt;[Door] it will work ONCE as soon as you tell the terminal to turn the switch off you've just cut power to the terminal. You have to go [PowerSource]-&gt;[Terminal]-&gt;[Switch]-&gt;[Door]
---
Planning out a clean looking but still functional electrical system in your C.A.M.P. is tedious but rewarding when it looks good.
---
And you could just eat Tatos. I heard theyre like cardboard with ketchup on one of Delberts holotapes. Not too far off from the taste of McDonalds fries.
---
I honestly wouldn't even be too mad if it wasn't a stealth nerf, I had been doing a lot more farming of Harpers Ferry recently because it also has a ton of good junk and chems to loot at the same time. 
---
But the problem now is twofold with it too - I have almost 0 reason to travel into The Mire anymore since the vendors are at Whitesprings.  A whole chunk of the of the map and surrounding area is not worth it if none of the bots even have a chance of being legendary.
---
I looooove walking around. Sometimes I just ignore everything I "should" be doing, and just pick a direction and see where it takes me. I think I've discovered all the map locations, but I'm still finding neat little things.
---
Yeah. But you could've came from a different state since I forgot that they brought people from different states. 
---
Even so, being from WV and trying to find your family or even trying to find your actual home would be nice.
---
But didnt I make any friends while living in vault 76? üò≠
---
I think the major disconnect comes from figuring out whether something is a legitimate "nerf" and when something just breaks after an update. For example when Adrenal Reaction broke a while back.. There were plenty of people running around calling it a stealth nerf, when in fact the update just broke it and was corrected in the next update . Just watch for the next update, there will be no shortage of people wrongfully claiming something was nerfed in the first few hours. It doesn't excuse people insulting you of course, but it's better to present hard data like the thread OP has done here. Many people have been spreading disinformation about this game from day one, so naturally people are skeptical.
---
Me and my cousin wish we could build on our family plot, but Mt Storm is just off the map in game. However, Mt Storm Power plant is in game, renamed as Thunder Mountain Power Plant. We have actually swam at the lake its built on. Middle of winter, the lake is still warm.
---
I can attest and if you look around on here others can too.
---
No problems so far.
---
Yeah that is always fun.
---
Is why this happened?

I always carry one. Sadly every event I go to. The damned thing is never vulnerable.
---
Pumpkin house
---
Some mods like Deep Pockets can only be learned fro ma plan or finding the mod itself.
---
Seems like alot of effort for nothing but that sounds like it should be fixed for sure.
---
Not gonna lie I didn't activate the pylons this time. Sat on the building with a bloodied sniper. I had the endangerol. I don't know if it stacks but he went quick.
---
This made me laugh alot this morning ! Thanks for the laugh
---
I can back this up with my own anecdotal evidence. I've done literally dozens of Watoga runs since last week's patch and I have not seen a single legendary protection. Prior to last Tuesday you would get 1-3 1\* Protectrons with the occasional 3\* spawn out of the total 35-40 Protectrons in town. _Some_ times you'd get none, or they'd drop dead and leave you nothing, or never leave their cans, but you could easily server hop or fast travel away and run another errand and come back and try again and pick up a handful of legendary drops. Mostly garbage, but sometimes you'd get something neat.
---
But for the last week: bupkis. Sure, they'll be a legendary mutant or scorched on the outskirts every so often. And the EMS will have a legendary boss about half the time or so. But literally zero legendary protectrons (or assaultrons or gutsys, which were pretty dang rare before) in Watoga since the April 9 patch.
---
I have a super op sneak build I wanna go through and take out each enemy slowly one by one without being detected.
---
Yes the effects stack per player. Up to a specific %. So if you fire again it just refreshes the time the effect lasts.
---
I selectively eat people who are trying to just hide and leech the event. I'm almost always the target for the boss, so I just stand next to them and watch them go down. Om nom nom burp. When I see a level 150+ dude just sitting there, it seems fair. And then the other people loot their junk and they send the Wasteland Standard Greeting, "Reported."
---
Yes and most of the vocal people on this thread seem to think they have the only valid opinions...because they're "real" Reddit users. Oh please. Their opinions are no more valid then the noob that started yesterday. People need to get off their high horse and realize that others dont give a rat's ass about min/max or that now, because of the horrible TSE nerf, it takes 2 and sometimes even 3 shots to kill that 3* legendary!  They're doing the same whining g, just on "important " things not silly casual things. 
---
Get over yourselves people others have as much valid input as you.
---
Now if they could just give the bunker buster its actual 20% damage boost.
---
But what about the fourth?
---
Lol. My character Roxie was the life of the party. I had sex with everyone so long as they were 16 (nuclear apocalypse, no such thing as too young if you have to be ready for the unknown), had sex with a robot, and even snorted cocaine off a dude's buttcrack. 
---
I was the living legend in there. Also known as a whore.
---
Thank god for this post I generally skip the fo76 sub nowadays cause it's just people complaining... very few good ideas, mostly people complaining about a game that's supposed to be an apocolypse adventure. 
---
Example: 
---
"Bethesda can we PLEASE FINALLY have free caps and no food spoilage and unlimited legendaries and stash space should be 1500."
---
I have already crafted you 2 lvl 50 Fixers! You can add me my PSN is lelizabeth95 :)
---
Yep. Just like a hazmat suit.
---
Damn that's pretty handy. Everyone should carry one.
---
I changed mine without a hitch but there was a thread earlier where someone had a problem with it. https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bdjhi0/changed_psn_id_lost_access_to_the_items_i_had/
---
Bloodied is the new ‚Äúnow‚Äù thing. Tse is till nerfed. But not enough. I say the double effect of the two just makes any gun a glorified grenade launcher.
---
Because regular stimpacks usually over heal, and you're able to turn 1 stimpack into 4 diluted which is pretty good with first aid level 3.
---
Nope but there are other weapons as good as tses were relatively speaking
---
Yeah basically just live with it
---
They're still popular and most people focus on shitty melee builds that require a lot of work put into them to be really effective like sacrificing all other cool perks just to get some melee damage going so
---
Yeah they should. but the counter to that is why not just hit things more. Why stop and deal less for a reduction on stats.
---
I was able to add the camouflage paint to the left leg of my power armor.
---
But it didn't buy it from the atom store.
---
I remember attacking them just to help the server stability.
---
You sound like b uh bubbles
---
That just means there was one there but it faded and the area hasn't reset yet. As long as players remain in the area, the glowing ghouls will continue to spawn, though without the nuke zone active they won't drop masses or high rad fluids.
---
People spending more money on cosmetic micro transactions would have prevented this change.... It sure as hell isn't causing it.... Derp
---
They already solved that problem in 4.  It was impossible to one shot a legendary enemy, you'd bring them down to 1hp and then they'd mutate and regen to full health.  These legendary enemies wouldn't be "normal", under the hood they would still be legendary and have that health gating at 1hp before the legendary mutation kicks in and changes their name.
---
You guys that come here and whine about this... TSE is still good and has some of the best DPS the game has to offer. Like seriously, it's difference between one shoting and two shoting your way through stuff. And nobody is stopping you from adjusting your build. With TSE you can ground out levels by the hour if you want.
---
I still use nerfed TSE and enemies arent bullet sponges.. Maybe u had the wrong perks equipped.. I dont understand when u stopped playing because of the nerf. It was necessary, TSE weapons were just too overpowered.  Every enemy was a one hit kill and the game became less challenging.
---
Well if me and everyone has to only hit it once, the endangerol lasts for 2 minutes. It could be really useful if the right people are there. I kept one shotting the handys that showed up when it wasn't vulnerable to keep my adrenaline up.
---
It doesn't get much better. My main is 270 and my PvPer is 120. I can only recount a handful of amazing drops since launch.
---
And i run a max crit vats reduction build. So i crit every 3 shots. At 2x 600 dam it's potent.
---
Please, this is Bethesda's playbook now. They got a taste of it with Fallout Shelter, decided to go all in with Fallout 76, now that they've fixed a lot of the bugs they will be gearing up for the Steam release with more MTX and as much pay to win as they can get away with.
---
Now you've got Blades, the worst of them all. Once these companies get a taste of the recurrent income from MTX it's all over.
---
If you have the mod you don't need the mats, just the applicable perks. However applying mods is a crapshoot right now, the last update broke something
---
You don't need the flux if you have the mod, you just hit the apply, but all mods were broken in the last patch. Hopefully, they fix it later today.
---
This has nothing to do with your original comment.
---
How about you stop being a condescending prick to people who have different opinions? It's not helping your argument, it just paints you as a dick and erodes your stance. 
---
You're quick to go to extremes and dismiss everyone elses anecdotal evidence because your anecdotal evidence contradicts it. Well guess what friend, it's all anecdotal, but if we look at a much larger sample size (being community wide) it would appear that the drop rate has in fact decreased. That would coincide with my own experiences, though it hasn't been a very drastic change. I've been getting more 3*'s overall, but fewer legendaries total. Though as I just said, anecdotal evidence is poor, so imo best option is to kick up some dust, have bethesda investigate and see what's actually happening.
---
Also, hard disagree with your whole tag thing. I want legendaries to be immediately and easily spotted from start to finish. Typically speaking, the community is pretty generous with letting each other tag legendaries, but everything else just gets mowed down. Your invulnerable extra shenanigans that you're suggesting just sounds like bug city to me and a lot of extra shit to deal with when an equally acceptable answer is just to fix it back the way it was. Besides, that method **will** inevitably lead to fewer people getting tags on legendaries.
---
Perfect! The context also applies to the game as well, given the mining industries prominence in the game.

"You're so ambitious, aren't you? You know what you look like to me, with your good bag and your cheap shoes? You look like a rube. A well-scrubbed, hustling rube, with a little taste. Good nutrition has given you some length of bone, but you're not more than one generation from poor white trash, are you, Agent Starling?"

"What'd your daddy do, was he a coal miner? Does he stink of the lamp?"

You can buy them from MODUS, or get pieces as a reward from Enclave events.
---
I know I was able to make Ultracite Fusion Cores once i got plans for the Prime receiver on the Gatling Laser.....but I also have 2 Ultracite laser rifles and they use regular Fusion Cells, so I think the Ultracite Gatling Laser will use regular fusion cores.
---
Thx for that info =)
---
Modus has all the pieces (at the first shop in the large area with all the crafting benches) , but only a few spawn in its inventory at once. Server hop a few times and you should nab a complete set pretty quickly.
---
I was testing the thing on Queenie with a few people. If at least 5 people hit her with the shot those two minutes are a blessing.
---
True, they are nowhere near viable atm. Think they might be somewhat usable when you have to deal with big wave of monsters but we don't have that yet. Even then, we got durability issue and can't fire more than 10 rounds without breaking the weapon. To make thing worse, grenades weigh a lot less and does equal damage Definitely needs fixing but imo damage isn't the issue. It's already an overkill and buffing damage won't change much I think
---
Many thx for that info =)
---
Mods are broken since last patch.
---
After comparing pictures of different brightness percentages, I found out that the 50% brightness modification that I made was a complete placebo and it doesn't seem possible to change the brightness of the power armor light. The mod that I attempted to modify was this one: [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/145](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/145)
---
Um, it has to do with *your* comment that I was responding to. 
---
It's so bizarre when people respond like that, like they don't want to address the content of the reply so they side step.
---
vendor in WS best bet
---
Theres also mods for the armor at the modus armory vendor, and plans to upgrade the underarmour at the production vendor.
---
Everything is tax free!
---
Just beat Goatsy. We are ready.
---
I think this has more to do with how you've played the game rather than levels. I've always gotten tons of 1 stars and a fair share of 2/3 stars. I'm curious if anyone else gets more 3 stars than 2 stars, because I do and always wondered if that was normal.
---
Only time I ever used them and found them particularly useful was at low levels. They aren't worth the time they take to throw later on, basically any weapon should out damage them. I do find them pretty fun though!
---
So the receiver doesn't work on the ultracite Gatling??? :(
---
That's awesome :) And tell me what super powers or mutations you have developed since swimming in said lake?
---
Upvote for the Brewster's Millions reference.  If you have a source of income in the game it could become spend as fast as you can on things you can't keep.
---
Thank you for this! Spent most of sun and mon prepping to take on a silo solo for first time. Just launched from bravo!
---
If it doesn't get pushed back. See camera and a couple other major features recently.
---
Haven't see that one, but can't be any worse than the road sign reading "Hamlin Meth Church" that wound up on Leno.  That was over in Hamlin WV.
---
That is badass! Great job!
---
The current build/character I‚Äôm running is using them all the way.  Yeah they aren‚Äôt too good late game. But this character isn‚Äôt trying to OP. For me they are a perfect side weapon for my crossbow considering the reload.
---
Not a problem. Have fun playing in your nuke field!!! Did you go team or solo?
---
How did you use the /s tag without the sarcasm bot coming by to chastise you?  Or does he only harangue me?  Edit?
---
Solo. I don't have much of a team aka no friend play it on ps4 lol.
---
Hmm. True. The BADTFL office is in Martinsburg.
---
i do it a lot and is mainly not to waist a full stimpak when/if I only need a little bit off health.
---
Naw bruh! I would have come with but unfortunatly I'm Xbox. 
---
On the other hand congrats on joining the solo launch club. I would make us all banners but i needed the resources to fix my stuff. X$ hahah
---
Well I built my second camp a few days ago. Made a nice sized house and it took about 2 or 3 hours to complete. Still got some budget left to add little things here and there.
---
What are you talking about? The camera hasn't been delayed.
---
You stated that spending money on cosmetics will push a developer into p2w mechanics. 
---
I said no. 
---
You said but Bethesda's mobile games are p2w.
---
I said that's unrelated. 
---
If the taste of mobile game p2w revenue has ruined the bethesda execs.. so be it. But my point still stands that this dude buying cosmetics does not entice the developers to create a p2w marketplace. It does the opposite. *See all successful games that run on cosmetics as reference. 
---
End.
---
The others nailed it. Modus has them. 
---
He is the ONLY source. There are no legendary drops except the on specific named chest piece (Last Bastion iirc).
---
global bug,
---
&gt;the last update broke something
---
When has it not?
---
Become a raider, take gun back by force, problem solved
---
My God, I am so sorry. I somehow managed to get myself a Bloodied Explosive 50. Cal, if I ever lost it..... If I can offer any future advice: When naming a weapon/armor/something to keep you should try to format it by putting a "-" in front. For example " - BFG 9000 " . This will put it right at the top of your list and help visibility when you're viewing the cumbersome menu.

Level 30 and higher requires ballistic fiber. All the stats are on that link.
---
Ok :) will give it a go. Thanks :)
---
Thank you!
---
I'll stop being a condescending prick when for once after a patch we don't have a train of idiots running here with the latest conspiracy theory trying to claim that their legendary spawns don't FEEL the same or they don't SEEM to be getting enough three star drops as before.  This shit has been going on for months now, if every claim of a legendary nerf had been true we wouldn't have any legendary enemies anywhere by now.
---
I'm dismissing peoples "anecdotal evidence" because ABSENCE IS NOT EVIDENCE.  If you take a walk through a park and don't see a single squirrel does that mean that god nerfed squirrels and they don't exist?  No, it means you didn't happen to see a fucking squirrel.  
---
All your "community" consensus means is that a lot of people are whiny sheep that jump at any chance to blame Bethesda for what is nothing more than their shit luck.  Just because a few people are making a loud enough fuss over something doesn't mean they're right.
---
One of the threads that popped up today and prompted me to write this post was a guy complaining that Bethesda had secretly nerfed the mole miners in Uranium Fever TO NOT DROP LEVEL 45-50 GEAR.
---
I have one left my psn is gofukyurslf326 I'll be on for a while it's 400 caps
---
Pipboy is doing a lot with that 64k. And consider Grafton's Mayor, any automatron, president Eden. The tech is there, now desktops are more or less an Apple II but thats a different story - likely the result of careful control on how much user accessible CPU power there is in the consumer market. After all, they seem to view most things from 1959 onwards (especially in civilian hands) as contributing to the decline of America. So no post 1950s music, no smartphones, no internet (that's how they lost control of information), and so on.
---
Thanks, great advice. Have done this with my other guns now.
---
Interestingly enough, I'm doing a nuked WS right now and almost everything is dropping a legendary, whether the creature is or is not labled legendary. I've gotten 14 legendary items in one circuit. I had 2 3* and 5+ 0* legendary mobs attack me in the building to the right of the WS building, too.  At the Golf Course me and 2 others mowed down about 15? or so bloated glowings and over half of them were some star variant or another.
---
It's all good, I've been soloing pretty much whole thing since beta lol glad to finally have that one finished off. Also glad I stocked up on ammo and stims lol
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/inside-the-vault-looking-beyond-patch-8-april-4-2019 
---
Yes it has. In case you're too lazy to look it up, "**Please Note:** While we originally planned to release the camera on April 16, we need a little more time to ensure it‚Äôs ready for you to start filling your photo books with memories. As a result, we‚Äôve moved the camera into a patch later this month."
---
Personally I had one of my best legendary runs EVER just a few days ago, all of which were properly marked.  During Encryptid while one shoting all of the adds I tagged three additional legendary robots and later that day during AWOL I ended up with another three before the boss even spawned.  While marked spontaneous spawns still exist this is more just an explanation to tie together both the complaints of people seeing less of them on average while others are finding loot on otherwise unmarked kills.
---
Dude this is sick I really like the style!
---
I found that one only last week!
---
Welcome to the KinderKorner of the feed. "Can I get a TSE in my camp cuz the other kids have one, can I get a (insert single issue fix here)." Geeze some people need to learn to deal with that they got. Granted we haven't got a whole lot.
---
More suggestions: 
---
(1) When they mutate, have them teleport out (like the mothman cryptid does) but then spawn other clones of themselves so you don't which is the real one and which are the clones. When you kill a clone you don't get any XP or loot dropping from it, so that way you know its just a clone. The clones would have less health and armor, so that you don't waste too much ammo or break your weapon, but still enough to make it a challenge.
---
(2) Have them spawn a few random (but difficult) enemies around you when they mutate eg. Red widow bloodburgs (spitting venom), colonel gusties, assaultron dominators, mirelurk kings. Adjust the health and armor on these, to give players a decent chance of defeating them.
---
Wow. That sure seems like an error to me, considering there's no point of using x-0.3 when x0 does the same thing. 
---
It had to have been 0.3, but I wonder if they'll change it, considering the majority of response to the event has been positive, as far as I can tell.
---
As I said a crapshoot. I've applied some mods since the last update, others nope. I applied a Calibrated Shocks mod bought from vendor over the weekend, so there is hope for you.
---
i havent got any disconects after the hotfix, before that i was getting a few server not responding and maybe 1 or 2 game crashes per 3 hours off play. but now I can play without any problems. I would check the setting on your new router maybe their somoething that is giving you problems to play.
---
Oh! Completely missed that. I stand corrected. Sorry mate.
---
While I am indeed lazy, in this case i had just missed it. Even read that article earlier.
---
I got a tip yesterday to do that ...my god the pain of removing ppl individually üò§
---
It was infuriating! One at a time and over 300 removed friends. It was a pain but my game works amazingly now.
---
This.  Killing a level 68 ghoul takes me two shots with TSE lever, one shot with BE lever.  TSE works just fine.
---
add me my GT is the same as here, I would help you and in no way or shape you will be holding me down.
---
So want to sell me your TSEs (if you are on PS4)?
---
Too late. Dropped the game already after having all my supply of fusion cores (50 or so, wasted whole Saturday farming them) munched by gatling laser in, like, 300 shots.
---
Thats awesome to know üëçüëç big thanks to you and the guy who messagem yesterday about this üòÅ
---
15 caps is its original price but I don‚Äôt want to sell a hat for 15 caps
---
It was a joke about how each patch generally breaks something that was working fine prior to the patch.  I guess my delivery was bad.
---
The ammo factory is a pretty bad way to get ammo unless you're just AFK-ing it. Letting him be would probably of been the better option since he was already wasting his time.
---
I have a 2nd one just for that to store the things I want to trade/sell, not so uncommon to see, actually everyone I play with has mutiple mule characters.
---
You‚Äôre welcome buddy! I just want the community to grow, not shrink.

Thx for that!

with what system do you play, I would love to take a peek at your "worthless 3\*" that you have.

---
I've had this happening to me for a few patches now. I actively hunt down scorchbeasts, and occasionally they'll all spawn around me when I fast travel somewhere. It's certainly a wierd bug.
---
My xbox live gamertag is Mazzuno. You or anyone else can feel free to add me, just send me a message saying its for Fallout 76. I enjoy doing almost any in game content but I mostly enjoy workshops and events. I‚Äôm a Level 37 intelligence, melee and shotgun build and I my character is a man with genius IQ who resulted to savagery and cannibalism to survive the wasteland :D
---
Unless this conversation was in an entirely different thread, there is no one who asked for clarification before her first two replies (the first reply I can see is someone assuming what was being referred to and saying the op was wrong, which is clearly not a quetion).  No one replied here asking if that was what she meant (unless large amounts of comments have been wiped from existance or this conversation happened elsewhere), and at the time of your color blindness remark the op had replied only once (not aggressively at all either, and definitely not any more so than that of the remark being replied to).  While you did reply asking for clarification, you also moved to accusing the op of downvoting as communication.  
---
So your entire history was downvoted once, as that is the number of times she replied to you (which saying "every response I recieved from the OP" seems an odd thing to say when it only happened once).  I have read all the comments here, not just a select portion.  My view of how things were handled was made with full awareness of all your comments, and takes into account all I have available here (if there are private conversations I am not aware of, obviously those wouldn't be accounted for).  To be completely clear, I also pay attention to the time that posts occur and made my reply fully aware of what had been said and when.
---
I'd hardly call anything the op has replied to be condescending (its possible to assume tones the words don't directly supply, but without assuming a tone there is nothing denoting the op feels superior to anyone else here).   I feel its more likely the op felt exasperated and frustrated when replying, and I feel that insulting her while trying to give her advice undermines any actual attempt being made to help (and like it or not, the comment I replied to is doing exactly that).  You seem to assume far more and even in your reply to me mischaracterize things (implying the op replied to you more than once, claiming the op was aggressive while feeling that the comment "They are different" wouldn't be seen as dismissive since the op had no way of knowing that reply was misunderstanding her intent).  Much as I don't feel its your intent to do so, I do feel that its impacting your ability to see things from the op's perspective or objectively.  I'd honestly say you may be just as defensive as the op likely has been, and it may do some good to step back and truly try to see things from her perspective (so reread those early comments without seeing them as obviously confused etc but from the view that I entered with and the op intended).  
---
I am also not meaning that comments were intended to be dismissive, but the oldest comments here are literally people just saying "they are different" and not trying to understand until after (and even in the comment you replied to of theirs asking about friends, I'd argue that the op already gave enough to show that teammates and friends likely weren't what was being referred to since she said "shade of yellow" indicating an awareness that player icons do show different shades).   I don't disagree that things could have been better explained, but I see that issue on both sides (the words you choose matter, and saying the op repeated nonsense is insulting and not true...since they only replied two times where they didn't clarify that entirely and both were clearly made before the op understood there was a miscommunication.  You can't explain that isn't what you meant when the entire content of the comment given is only "they are" or "they are gold compared to washed out yellow" (and replying in simple facts isn't inherently aggressive, though I am sure it seemed that way to those who misunderstood her, just as they seemed to her).
---
As someone who felt the need to express to the op how she mishandled things and what she could do to improve, I felt you may benefit from the same.  Hopefully my comments are being taken with the intention they are being given.
---
Nice...
---
I'll be honest, I don't think I've noticed anyone hiding in the 10-ish times I've completed the event. I have seen players that certainly don't know what the event actually requires them to do, but people have been pretty good about actually giving it their best shot! That said, I haven't seen more than one Encryptid event in the last two days on Xbox, so I'm likely not seeing a large portion of player actions. Could be I've just been lucky!
---
Off-topic: Just missing the Imposter head/outfit and Assaultron plan, and I can't find enough events to even consider grinding for them (and not enough caps to spare to handle all the disconnects I've had this past week). Fingers crossed the Burrows is a tad less demanding to start up, 'cause I'd love to have something consistent to do besides waiting for events to spawn.
---
you can literraly kill the SBQ and 1 sec later fast travel to a different silo and nuke her again she will come out again.
---
I and a group off my freinds nuked her 9 times in a row, of course we need to jump servers 3 times to do it but, we didnt waited no time it waas one after the other once she was dead. 
---
the silo part took longer than killing the SBQ
---
Jeez someone would have thought they'd won the lotto with that pickup!!! 
---
I did that same and put my beloved 3* anti armour explosive handmade into the corpse of a scorchbeast but I managed to pick it straight back up.
---
I had a heart attack just doing that though! I probably would have cried if I lost it!
---
I did the same and put my beloved 3* anti armour explosive handmade into the corpse of a scorchbeast but I managed to pick it straight back up.
---
hey but I am, I would love to look at what you have maybe we could work smething out, my GT is the same as here.
---
That's a good roll.
---
dont be mad becuase you play in the darkside ;), you can always come to the light is you would like.
---
I've never found an Ultracite Gatling Laser to find out. I've found several Ultracite Laser rifles/pistols though....and every one of them have used regular cells, though they each have their own pool of upgrades. So, assuming mods work the same for the Ultra Gatling Laser and regular Gatling Laser, they'll have their own mod pool as well. So the Ultracite Gatling Laser probably has its own Prime receiver.
---
Dude this is fucking amazing! Like holy shit
---
how much do you want for the AA Mr. Handy and the Bloodied ripper?
---
Did that yesterday with a random group. I went down once and was stim'd 2 seconds after.
---
I just kept punching it with tenderize so it kept coming after me. I have marsupial so I just kept jumping around a pylon and it followed me, it's head bobbing up and down. I'd get to the peak of my jump, VATS target, and falcon punch down, then just keep jumping. It's hit kept missing. Everyone else was free to manage the pylons or grind it into mutton with their heavy guns.
---
It is quite glorious when random people all enact an on the fly plan.
---
Commenting so I can find this post next time I load up 76.

Join my server nuke is dropping
---
Speaking as a new player, this is very insightful! Thank you! This game could really use more resources and information out there about the game mechanics.  
---
These might not be the type of questions or suggestions you wanted, but I'd really appreciate descriptions of all the legendary effects that aren't just simple +x% or -y% to whatever. The wikis aren't super helpful and look like they just copy paste the minimalist item descriptions (if they're even up to date at all). For instance Two Shot is listed as ["Shoots an additional projectile at 25% base effect."](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects) Does this mean the second projectile only does 25% of the base damage without your damage modifiers? Or does it have a 25% chance to proc a second projectile that does full damage? 
---
If you have mutations, is Mutant's "Damage increased by 10% if you are mutated" the same as Assassin's "+10% damage to players" but better because it effects everything? Or are the damages calculated differently?
---
The reflect damage perk says it doesn't work in pvp, but does the major modifier "Reflect 50% of damage while blocking"? Does reflected damage also reduce damage you take? Is reflected damage calculated before or after your damage resistance? Is reflected damage calculated before or after their damage resistance? Reflect damage is so damn complicated and every game does it a tiny bit different lol. 
---
How do explosive weapons work exactly? How much does furious add per consecutive hit? Sorry I've got a billion questions, I'll end it here haha. Thanks to anyone that takes the time to answer anything.
---
What's the best way to get ammo? I am constantly chewing through 5.56.
---
What?
---
it‚Äôs not the single use ones, it shows up as craftable in my PA bench. Unless that‚Äôs also a glitch?
---
no it sure as hell dont lol
---
To the right of silo bravo or Charlie. Whichever one is in the North. There's a perfect spot with a hell of a view!
---
Didn't even know one could get plans for the lights
---
Pretty sure that is a deliverate choice to lreve t accidents. I for one appreciate it.
---
We need a Bot that just deletes or moves these.
---
I really wish they at least had given it the legs
---
lmao thats hilarious

I'm interested in how he blocked the entire area with spring traps? You can contest the workshop from anywhere in the build area, you don't need to get in the building. 
---
Could contest from outside and coerce him out?
---
TSE is still really good, especially for those like me that don‚Äôt want to run really complex, limited builds. With the right perks and situations everything but SB‚Äôs are 1-3 shot kills with my TSE lever. I can hold my own with it in PvP too. If that‚Äôs the only thing that kept you away, you should reconsider.
---
Thanks, I was wondering this after doing some workshops since the resource extractors are still available in your camp. Now I just have to learn what they look like without the big green glowing "extractor goes here"  thing the workshops have.
---
Thanks for the endangerol tip. I'm 160 and never used it before. 
---
Just got one and i'm hoping it'll be useful for the new dungeon.
---
There's two separate things here. Ultracite gatling laser is a base gun. If you can make ultracite fusion cores, that's for a mod (prime receiver) you can add to a base gatling laser.
---
Definitely not between the Devil's Backbone and West-Tec.  No good spots there for sure.  The view of the bog and Watoga is for sure overrated.
---
awesome!
---
This has been happening sense beta, mobs not marked as legendary dropping legendaries. I've mostly seen it happen in White Springs, but have had it happen throughout the map. It may just be more noticeably recently because people are talking about a legendary nerf.
---
I am!! I need something new to do lol
---
oh this is a great idea!
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bdpn9l/watoga_was_stealth_nerfed_for_legendariesdata/
---
I've noticed it too, especially Watoga or other areas with a lot of them. Even Whitespring and Enclave Bunker, I've noticed the bots there dying.
---
I can't honestly remember, but try both. It's probably a complete unequip
---
thats gorgeous
---
Best bet would be to find a community in your region so you have similar play times, or a themed community that you relate to like a BoS or Enclave. 
---
On PC most of these would be on Discord. 
---
I know of a BoS one if you're interested?
---
Did you kill Watoga robots en masse and found any unmarked legendaries? 
---
I kill everything in Whitesprings and Harper's Ferry and the number of legendary drops are down by at least 20%. Also 3\* dropping 3\* chances are down too, now around 30% (it used to hover around 40%).
---
Also what's with "it's just RNG luck"? There is this thing called distribution. For example, if you are supposed to get an item 50% of the time, but you rolled 100 times and never got it, is it luck or bug?
---
I have a feeling the nuclear winter update will focus on this. At the very least being able to prestige will give you a reason to visit the low level areas again without feeling like you're wasting your time. Maybe nuclear winter mode will have the whole map be max level and then some.
---
I put more than half my long play sessions into sprucing up my camp or rebuilding it for one reason or another.
---
A long play session for me is a rare day of 8 straight hours.
---
I see your point. With lucky perk packs you can end up with this build around level 60. There is 56 cards to gain via packs up to that point. Pretty good chance to get some needed ones.
---
Hmm.. ok. I stand corrected, there is not much of a reason to get levels higher than 70, in edge cases of bad luck let it be 80.
---
*But I vaguely remember something that will change this in upcoming patches.*
---
Great roll, don't ler it go. Enjoy!
---
Maybe if the game was properly made in the first place we wouldnt have all these request topics.
---
Yea, it's kinda lame, I love my explosive weapons but they just don't do the damage they should, hell, my Nuka-Grenades do more damage than everything else in my inventory, other than my TS Fatman.
---
On the subject of explosives...why is the blast of a Nuka Quantum grenade so small? it's like a tiny blue mini nuke going off that doesn't really do anything unless it's right at the feet of an enemy....my regular Nuka Grenades are more effective...
---
Its BOS left and right arm. Marine armour left and right leg and the chest piece you get for doing a quest, the chest piece is 'last bastion' which I got for officer on deck.
---
Every legendary drops from the same pool of shit though, regardless of how many 'stars' or how hard it is to kill. I do love a good gear slot machine, because that's what I play Fallout for. /s
---
QE Harpoon would still win but its a nice roll anyway
---
Oh my god YES. Soooo sick of this.
---
As a player that runs in two groups I am actually loving the friendly fire mess xD
---
Does a 2 shot dragon fire 8 rounds?
---
I can't access the video since i'm from the EU, lol
---
Had to jump through hoops with that router,  Switching and resetting a lot of things but its working better now. Guess it was just a dice toss because i had tried earlier and had no luck, but it was the newest thing introduced  so the problem being the router was very likely.
---
Sorry on PS4:(
---
I use that ammo and I‚Äôm actually out of that ammo lol
---
Another awesome way to play the game is deep dive into the ‚Äúworld‚Äù category challenges. So many places you‚Äôll see undiscovered on that list and will have you seeking them out ASAP.
---
Yea that‚Äôs true. Id scrap it.
---
How long would those items stay in the queue waiting to be picked up anyway? Because this would easily turn into some extra stash space exploit.
---
Did you use the animal whisperer perk to chill him out?
---
I have to wonder ‚Äúwho not keep the (semi)tamed beasts and robots from fo4 dlc‚Äù?
---
They already have the code, and its balenced to have non static defence.
---
I give you Colter from Fallout 4's Nuka-World DLC. He was invulnerable unless you squirted his electrified PA with a water gun.
---
Soemhow this makes me think of Home Alone, when the kid uses mannequins to pretend there is a party.
---
Lol the one dlc i didnt get!
---
Draw the enemies out. Then jump up on the wall that separates the clubhouse and the pool (jump onto the hedges then onto the fence). Enemies won‚Äôt be able to touch you, you can take them out in your own time, and you‚Äôll level up quickly.
---
Mine had breakfast
---
It was probably me. I'm glad you laughed though. Some people get really mad. If someone ate me, I would have to laugh!
---
Yeah it was the animal friend perk card at 3 star. Basically you can tame some random location animals and they stay at your camp
---
Same, lol. My friends and I have been doing this since the event started.
---
The only PvE danger for my stealth sniper builds are the sheeplords pylons. Zero melee, maximum sneak. Shreds through players and monsters alike.
---
Farm whitesprings and west tek. Used to be the three W's now it's two I guess... until they nerf West tek into the ground and we're forced to run whitesprings lol. 
---
Maybe they're trying to nerf legendary spawn to force us back into using nukes to farm? After all they were supposed to be the end game content. If only nukes had good spawn rates... you know, like the game launched with? "Let's nerf nukes. People stopped doing them? I have an idea, instead of buffing nukes to be worth doing again we'll nerf everything else!"
---
Gotta love completing the latest endgame content on the highest stakes mode only to get a 1* wooden armor.
---
Never ganna happen due to easy abuse.
---
You could ‚Äúgift‚Äù things to your alt characters to act as extra storage, break barter bots‚Äô cap limit and facilitate paid (real money) item sales much more easily.
---
Sad but true. If the player rate ever dies out they will probably let you do whatever you want, but for now balence shall rule till the next main title comes out.
---
Yeah, I live in GE and I have to change a lot off settings on the routers to be able to play xbox.
---
Yeah, I mean I was a little disappointed.  
---
But man, was it an experience that I'll never forget lol.
---
It doesn't matter if the nerf was on purpose or it was a bug, a nerf is a nerf. I agree that people often overreact, but over reacting to someone elses overreaction isn't the smartest move.
---
When i was like level 5 i built my camp over a lead ore vein. 
---
Didnt realise that was a good thing? I just pick up the 14 ore every time i spawn or travel there, so i probably have hundreds by now
---
My anti-armor, faster swing speed switchblade kicks ass!  I love switchblades. And buzzblades.
---
Every single Bethesda Fallout game had duplication bugs in their trade menus directly related to item-&gt;item trading. My guess is that's why they removed that functionality.
---
that's funny :-D
---
DON'T DIE! Somebody in here might eat you. Looks like a trend.
---
Sorry for you loss. If I would pick it up and you could prove me it was yours (all 3 \*, custom name resets when dropped) I would give it back to you, but the chance new owner read this is slim...
---
It's a known bug, have have to say, BGS has dropped the ball on taking so long to fix this. I don't mind visual bugs as much as I do this one.
---
I like finding typewriters in washing machines after someone left them in his pockets when throwing his pants in
---
If you have an NVIDIA card newer driver and software releases may have properly picked up the game on reinstall. There were tons of issues with NVIDIA cards not handling things causing CPU usage to 99% trying to deal with what the video card should have been.
---
I have to look but I think I got a maxed one a few days ago.
---
Dang thanks for the info. Also, do you know if there's any way to fix it?
---
Definitely taking that card when I get back into this.  You just end up with it as a permanent pet?
---
Good idea.
---
Exactly where my camp is, west around 200m from the munitions plant, little dip in the mountain, with dirt for a decent garden
---
Do you know when the silo codes expire/refresh? I could start hunting as soon as the new ones are available.
---
Use multiple guns and wander the map. I get tons of ammo for guns I don't use.
---
I'm a huge fan of Adamantium Skeleton personally, especially since I don't like to use Power Armor.
---
Solar Powered isn't the best, but Sun-Kissed to remove rads in sunlight is *awesome*. I basically only use RadAway if I'm being swarmed by ghouls in the middle of a fight.
---
I have a full set of Ultracite, from completing the quest, still can only build Torso's.
---
What about the cliff overlooking the Bog? I'm down the cliffface, but up top is sorta flat.
---
I am not, because looking at how bad, boring and dumbed down the content so far have been, it will be probably major let down, even when you are not expecting anything. Either the content will be really easy or it will be same idiotic as every group content so far.
---
Yep. These codes refresh on the 22nd. I try to remember to put the dates in the title. (Mostly so i myself remember) Thanks so much for the offer of help man. Really appreciated.
---
About half my arsenal is AA weapons. I have a couple of the same instigating weapons  and I like the consistency of the AA over the instigating. Plus when stacked with perforating or puncturing mags..stacks even more.  Also have AA Railway Rifle, Ultracite rifle(though, I'm not sure it works with it), 10mm pistol and a couple melee weapons. I also run Rifleman perks. I love my  AA weapons.
---
yes, you can go there and the plan will be there 100%
---
so should i replace solar powered with ironclad?
---
Just gonna throw this idea here because...Ron Perlman for ingame DJ...somebody make that happen.
---
Yeah I pickup most ammo types that I come across and then can trade for what I use, but I go through a lot because I mainly use 1 weapon. Need an alternate.
---
I'm excited about the dungeon. Going to try and solo it first run then find a team in the ChatMod community if needed.
---
I'm not excited about all of the people who try it once, die, then come here to complain about it being broken or how people are so stupid and caused them all to die.
---
They also placed a vendor of each type inside white spring so you don't have to travel everywhere anymore...
---
My guess is no, i5 is not gonna be the issue you will have a really bad GPU. I mean it might run and start but it will run at 3 gpd and your surface will heat up like a mofo
---
Semi or full auto?
---
No but if they did would they even be able to hear them without subtitles?
---
This doesn't work on ps4 unfortunately, the recently played with list is borked :(
---
Semi! 
---
I am constantly crafting with Ammosmith and Super Duper as well.
---
If you're on ps4 you'll need someone you have friended and they are playing.
---
What exactly is this and how do I do it lol
---
It's not so much the posts themselves but the IDENTICAL posting that occurs constantly here.
---
If the mods don't want to curtail this, like countless other subs for much more popular games have, maybe its time they stop being mods and find people who actually want to do this job.
---
In my early days of playing fo76 I found dog kennel filled with chemistry junk. Also there was periodic table of elements painted on the inside wall of this kennel. Never came across it again
---
I'm running into this too.. been near max caps for three days... Just started picking fights, didn't really wanna start a mule :/
---
&gt; became less challenging.
---
I would say it was less tedious. The game isn't exactly more challenging just because you need to dump more ammo into something.
---
I thought I did notice something like that too? I was wondering why there is no more legendaries in Watoga. I thought it's just bad luck. I also had the gutsies which I found rather cool because the they showed up after I pestered the protectrons for some time. But no legendaries either .  
---
I believe the last patch changed quite a few things which didn't get mentioned. 
---
P.S: I recently posted about my 3\* Grognak axe which didn't show when at the workbench. I does now. But now I cannot attach a mod to my 3\* Pole hook - It's all there - the perks - the do you really want to destroy mods depending on this (there aren't any), the materials (which aren't necessary because I got the mod) - It's just NOT WORKING! This stuff does my head in, seriously.
---
He's thinking of Rad-X? Radaway is fine for mutations.
---
no I do not know, my guess is their is nothing we can do but wait until BGS fix it.
---
I built on top of Seneca Rocks once and the view was amazing, the higher peak you will need a jetpack or marsupial to get to but I personally think that area had a little more land to work with.
---
I made a screenshot for easy view: https://imgur.com/a/TPwzcth
---
I will slap a different barrel on it later and also an automated receiver again (before the update it would break too easily, so I had to put a semi on it).
---
Try out a combat rifle or lever action, .45 is pretty plentiful.
---
dont know what system you are playing on but on xbox as off last night the fusion cores I found were charged differently, i picked up 4 or 5 and they ranged from 40% to 75% charge.
---
I'm going to say this one more time. As someone who not only looks through the data files of the game but is also creating mods to fix Bethesdas screw ups like the repair bug and is also looking through the application code itself I can tell you without a shadow of a doubt that you are experiencing bad rng. There is no modifier anywhere for Watoga when it comes to legendary spawns at all. What you are seeing is probably due to an amount of legendary spawns elsewhere in the world or just bad rng. 390 enemies is not nearly enough to try to base this on. Bring me 5000 examples with video proof and then you have some solid info. Too many people spread false or misleading or misunderstood information on this reddit and all it does is cause people to keep thinking that something is happening when it just isnt.
---
Define "good".
---
What do _you_ want to get out of it? What do you enjoy?
---
I went for my "normal" Fallout build, which is excactly a Jack of all Trades, wanted to to a little Shotgun and sniping...
---
And over the course of leveling I devided to go full on sneaky melee instead.
---
Redistributing Points and learning what things Work for me and my playstyle was a learning curve.
---
So yeah, now I can handle myself with two handed weapons in PA, and do good with one handed ones. I enjoy crafting, Picking flowers and cooking.
---
I Like my build but it would totally Go down with ANY PvP. Any any real specialiaed build. But since this was never my Intention to compete, I am fine.
---
What is wrong with farming Watoga? The bots respawn, don't they. I usually go and drop all the items I don't need into the suitcase at the station for someone to pick them up.
---
even when storing is a miss or hit, I have lost stuff with storing and without.
---
Honestly I'm better when they did the patch they made a bad handler locally for one of the packets forcing a mismatch as the server knows its legendary but the client does not
---
Fuck him!
---
I‚Äôm indeed on PS4, I wasn‚Äôt a duper back then but I have so many TSE‚Äôs stored on my mule characters because dupers used to dump them on me for free. But I‚Äôve heard that Bethesda had a ban purge for many accounts that is associated with duping and had thousands of weight on them. I haven‚Äôt played the game since the ban wave so I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm banned or not ( even tho I didn‚Äôt dupe anything at all ) but if they are not, then I‚Äôm gladly willing to give you whatever you want for free
---
Got mine there the other day along with the lever plans.
---
Also in addition the bot gets 2x damage output soooo yea that ends up being a crap load of damage.
---
To the guy who brought all his color flux to the event famous for everyone dying
---
You're an idiot
---
I‚Äôm level 150 and I just saw it Sunday in Watoga. Just keep looking. It‚Äôs around. Also it‚Äôs pretty expensive I bet you could get it from another player cheaper.
---
Lol I was literally putting it in my stash as it popped up and I missed the Violet and left. I never die their also
---
I'm only level 55 so I'm ready to join a group of 100s and let them carry me through it. I'll at least do what I can with my sniper rifle.
---
All mutations work best when in a group with other players who have mutations and using class freak. When running solo or with a group and the other player doesn‚Äôt have any mutations you don‚Äôt get the best results. 
---
Stranger in numbers also gives you a boost. Unless you are a bloodied build. Then it breaks it. 
---
Hope this helps.
---
The way I read it is it was designed for 2 50+ players. I haven't seen anything to suggest that you can only go in as a team of 2
---
This is caused by the server culling the lower necessity enemies usually following higher level regions. I never see it happen at Flatwoods for example.
---
"I never die there"
---
*Makes post about having his shit stolen after dying*
---
ü§∑
---
Haha I know right. First time actually. Done it about 10 times
---
You fucked up, enjoy the fact that you making a mistake got you punished.
---
Well. I just wanted to tell him fuck you and move on with my day lol
---
These posts seems to resurface now and then, but PvP factions is already planned, and has been for a very long time. 
---
https://bethesda.net/en/article/2WjxCxOyFG2AYWSMComy4W/fallout-76-launch-and-beyond
---
We aren't getting a patch. No downtime has been announced
---
I think it‚Äôs probably what you say towards the end that different people play the game differently. 
---
I love building CAMPS and it feels like most patches, while they do make major improvements, also either leave a major bug or introduce a different problem. 
---
The floating objects one has been there for me since day one beta and somehow happens every time I build. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm doing wrong, or something wrong with my install, or computer, or what. 
---
Each CAMP I‚Äôve built has had floating bits I couldn‚Äôt remove unless I moved the CAMP and started building again. Which is fine except for the issue where it says it‚Äôs 40 caps then charges you 160. 
---
Every patch since the start I get excited to build but each patch I get disappointed that the same bug screws up my building every time. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt stop me from loving the game though. I still play it regularly 3-4 days a week. It‚Äôs just when I hit those same bugs, or disconnects I‚Äôve been experiencing for months I simply stop and wait a few days to come back. 
---
I guess it‚Äôs like struggling to finish a hard level in a game where you get so frustrated you have to put the controller down. 
---
Anyway, the other QoL improvements have been great too. There are definitely fewer bugs and overall problems and some nice content improvements. Once backpacks, player/legendary vending, and dungeons are introduced I‚Äôll start playing it a lot more. I still think a lot of these things should‚Äôve been in the game at release though and I think that in 6 months to a year they‚Äôll add in a lot of amazing content that will finally overshadow a lot of the negative aspects that occurred during the creation of this game. 
---
Also, to consolidate comments I love playing AoE2 and I‚Äôm always surprised to see how much the community is growing. I hope other game companies do similar HD improvements to games without changing much of the content. I‚Äôd love to see a Caesar III HD version.
---
I am down, shoot me a text on xbox, my GT is the same as here, it could be all lower case I dont remeber lol.
---
I would love that!   But:   You really ought to try the game again.  It is a lot more stable now.
---
Thank you for taking time to explain your argument thoroughly and not just going "I am affected by this bug since release so this game sucks". Have a good day!
---
Hitting max as well, I spend on ballistic fibre instead of grinding for the tape and bags.  It makes a small dent in the caps tho.
---
Maybe BGS do need to think of other ways for us to spend our caps...perhaps a couple of new serums. 
---
Just throwing this idea out there....the syringer has been seriously under utilised, maybe they need to create more types of ammo for it with different effects which can only be purchased from vendors - not crafted.
---
im down, GT is the same as here
---
Sweet, will you be available on Thursday? If so you can add me! Let‚Äôs just hope I‚Äôm not banned, because if Iam there‚Äôs no way in Todd Howard‚Äôs hell im gonna restart the game
---
There‚Äôs new quests in the free Wild Appalachia DLC involving Nukashine (new alcoholic craft able drinks) and a quest involving the Sheepsquatch. Both are pretty fun
---
Also:  Bethesda generally just reduced multiple stacks to one item.  Getting banned was reserved for those with thousands of identical rare items.
---
Yup, anyone can buy it now for about 1700.
---
Wouldn't poisoned throwing knifes and sticky knife grenades make the throwing weapons option even better.
---
I am available any time‚Äîincluding Thursday.  I sent you my PSN.
---
Lets hope we can buy legendary effect from the new vendor
---
Very nice item! :)
---
Poison knives yes. Knife grenades. I‚Äôd rather just grenade them
---
Geese I'm the one who lost all the flux and everyone commenting is more salty then I am ü§£
---
PS:  Bethesda is issuing new content weekly since early March.
---
I've gotten idle explosions 5 times. I'm so sick of it XD
---
I'm pretty excited.
---
Gonna see how well I can clear it with 3 different characters each with their own unique builds.
---
We should be able to sell it when player vending machines are released in April. Oh..in  May. Oh...in June...
---
Cool, will do
---
there is a robot that is furry
---
hey, I live here in GE as well, do you play on xbox, if so add me up. I need GE ppl to play with.
---
They can drop randomly from events in the Bog.  I got 1 from Census Violence and then 1 from Surface to Air.
---
Nah man, it‚Äôs not my job to convince you to play the game. There are tons of articles and videos out there, describing the new content and the improvements.
---
Definitely....It can be a real pain to find some of the new stuff and I end up having to look in every category.
---
You should not really get valuables into such a fight. Mainly because you know there are bored kids who enjoy destroying your decon shower and stealing flux.
---
Only 3 disconnects and 1 blue screen in an hour tonight. It's much better!
---
Just watch for new DLC patches. Any time they do those, they add a bunch of new bugs and the lag goes up a ton from more people doing the new stuff. Wait for them to neglect the game for a bit and people to start whining for new stuff to do. That's the time to pick it up again, especially if starting a new character. Because it runs like shit otherwise.
---
For someone who can't find the energy for anything you sure typed a lot :) Stop trying to force this game to fit you. You've got end game fatigue. Did you enjoy *any* of it?
---
It's the weapon mod and in the files it's listed as an atom shop only item and was accidently tied to this plan
---
Someone's working on a mod to block that.  Should be coming tomorrow.
---
I sure hope so.
---
Yes there are only 2 spawn locations of animals you can tame that o know about,  but you can have more than one, but they take up build budget. They always defend you base and even come back if they die as far as I'm aware. I watched a YouTube video on where to find them
---
Really that's a thing? Nah I was throwing all my flux in my stash and quickly fast traveled their but missed it. After I died obviously came up saying someone stole your loot and when I went to make some ammo it wasnt their. I just made 25. Shit happens. I'm re farming right now
---
part off the grind my friend, but the way we do it (the ppl I play with) we know what ammo each person use so we all collect for each other and when we get together we just give each other the ammo we need. the more ppl you have doing it the easier it is.
---
Whatever legendary you can find.
---
You Seem like the kinda guy to piss his pants to keep himself warm
---
Because Bethesda is lazy.
---
The Ultracite Gatling Laser does indeed use regular Fusion Cores.  When you Prime it, then it will require Ultracite Fusion Cores.
---
Whoops...
---
Sorry, who are you and why the hell should we? Go ask your mommy.
---
Not planing to stay in came, log on, trade and out again
---
I swear I was just telling someone that I was releasing a mod to get rid of this tomorrow
---
I heard if you uninstall it and reinstall it that fixes some issues, while it's not the best fix I actually plan on doing that overnight to test the theory out myself.
---
Could someone explain what legacy weapons are?  I have heard the term but am unsure of what it refers too. Thanks!
---
This made me crack up 7 hours ago when I woke up, and I'm cracking up again after checking back in. Quality post.
---
how is placing traps an exploit? It sounds like you're just upset he found a funny inefficient way to fuck with people
---
If your builds are synergized with the right perks, I doubt you'll have much trouble.
---
Oh my god yes. Thanks for saying what thousands of us are thinking. I was going to post that same thought. It‚Äôs out of control. Those people jut need to design there own game. They have it all wrong as to how a game studio works. It‚Äôs as if they treat Bethesda as there asking there parents for a ice cream treat. Bethesda is not you personal game developer.
---
I have noticed that grognaks axe doesn't show up at the workbench if it can't be repaired at the time, since it doesn't have any mod options it just doesn't appear in the list. Not sure if that's what was happening with yours
---
no, it's not the bug - melee and unarmed weapons get additional damage when over-repair (for more than 100%) which slowly goes down when using and loosing durability from 200% to 100%.
---
Your rig/internet is whacked.
---
I had two accounts on for over 13 hours combined last night. Had one DC, on my mule for idle timeout (got a sheepsquatch event, and forgot to log off my mule before it timed out)
---
On what platform? I'm on PS4.
---
It's for the assaultron head weapon not the helmet
---
Would anyone be down to go at the SBQ on PC tomorrow around 6pm cst? It‚Äôs been on my bucket list for a long time.
---
They didn't say but it got me thinking might be worth a shot? Worst case scenario it still is the same lol I'm on PC.
---
i know they are repaired to 200% and the damage is still less
---
so easy to fix. Random loot for caps.
---
Like every other mmo since the 1900s.
---
Not gonna comment on the rest of your post other than this bit...unless recently changed durability is ONLY lost for hits, not misses. This is easy to test. Repair a gun to 100%. Fire a clip at the wall. Try to repair again, it should say weapon doesn't need it. Fire a few rounds at a living target and try to repair yet again and now you should have an option to repair.
---
I have collected those in the past month and got a few but never seen that one. http://imgur.com/a/zj7sAw7
---
Id wait until after tomorrows update myself. (I'm only on 16mb connex from home)
---
Heard its supposed to rebake some failed lighting issues. Which means a huge update.
---
Melee build? Extra strength from solar powered increases your weapon damage ;)
---
Time zone?
---
I don‚Äôt remember reading plans for them. Do you think they‚Äôd come with the one power armor mod perk? if not, then it‚Äôs *definitely*a bug which would explain why it doesn‚Äôt work. Thanks for the responses!
---
That's a really great idea, they should make ammo that would effect pvp but not too overpowered
---
Noted
---
Just outside the Palace of the Winding Path in the smaller gazebos there's a grizzly, panda, and polar bear stacked up like in the cartoon We Bare Bears. And there's a row of blocks deeper inside that spell out "drugs" in one of the rooms which is also filled with a ton daytripper.
---
Nope not yet. I'll let everyone know when it's in finally
---
hm.... I'll hop in-game to test this again to be sure. If you're right, then I will concede that my memory was incorrect on that matter.
---
Noted, thanks! I've moved around a bit, I was getting a lot of "someone else is using your camp spot in this world" messages anyways.
---
Yep, maybe they shouldn‚Äôt do any damage, maybe just cosmetic funny effects like bloaty head from the old Theme Hospital game :)
---
Do you still have the fireman uniform (not firebreather)? If you do, how much?
---
Honestly you could say the same about weapon nerfs and ‚Äúwhy should I return‚Äù posts. A lot of this subreddit is just reposts of reposts and it‚Äôs a little dull. There‚Äôs asking questions and getting answers and then there‚Äôs just plain annoyance
---
It's all about telling a story the way someone likes it.
---
Let's take for example the lack of legendary mobs in Watoga.
---
Is it real? Yes and bethesda admitted it. It's a bug. 
---
Do people care what bethesda said? Nope, not at all, they just keep saying that Watoga was stealth nerfed.
---
Even so i don't think that everyone who claims "stealth nerf" is doing it out of malice. Some people simply don't know that bethesda knows watoga is a bit fucked. It will probably be fixed soon but eh...
---
Directly south of Fort Defiance is quite high and flat
---
It‚Äôs a game. Not a relationship. Come back or don‚Äôt people shouldn‚Äôt have to convince you.
---
maybe Bennie is gonna lay some eggs on your C.A.M.P. you could end up with some radchicks
---
It‚Äôs probably warm. Gotta keep the rads percolating. Lol
---
and I can say the other way around, i been to watoga 100s off times to farm for xp or sell and I bearly find any legendaries there for me to kill, is all he say, she said stuff.
---
but I am a fact guy and if the data miners are telling us nothing changed, then I would have to listen to what they said becuase I am not a data miner. 
---
if you  dont think is true what they are saying then do your on research and look into the files. a lot off things happens in the background that you have no idea they do, the only way to find out what does are is to look into the game files, doesnt matter how long you have played you wouldnt know how it really works without looking past what you see in your screen.
---
Grenades can be avoided by sprinting past the point where they land. Knifes are already unique since they instantly damage when thrown.
---
So to make throwing knives and tomahawks more effective late game, there would be an added mechanic to with an explosive mod.
---
When thrown the explosive knife or tomahawk would connect with target (dealing initial damage- standard throwing weapon damage.) The weapon would stay stuck in the target and the explosive charge would be triggered immediately after the initial connection damage and trigger another hit with explosive damage.
---
The charges would flash red and beep on a timer before exploding (exactly like the bombs on super mutant suiciders)
---
Heyo! Did anyone take you up on this offer? I wouldn‚Äôt care to launch a nuke when I get on in a few minutes! :) my psn is radiationdaddy
---
I'd just run system specs for minum requirement against pc components from Microsoft page should tell you
---
And i gues they wouldnt be mods, just new types of throwing weapons plans.
---
To make the explosive throwing weapons balanced they would weigh more than standard versions require rare ingredients to craft. That way people weren't walking around with hundreds of them.
---
At least if you're white knighting your armor will  have to be repaired less.
---
Yes he's real and in the game he just hasn't had the flag they put in enabled yet.
---
I gotta have dinner soon and stuff but I‚Äôll defs add you when that‚Äôs all done. I‚Äôll try not to be too long
---
Unfortunately not, I‚Äôm on PS4. Seems like very few Germans in here. Asked a couple of times, only found one so far... :(
---
Probably just a weight and damage increase. And make sure to not have them effected by perks.
---
How do you make it 'trigger'?
---
I have walked up and down the road, approached Boomer, server hopped next to Boomer, logged out next to him before turning in for the evening... nada.
---
I have done that will all four and... nada.
---
Is there like a 'weird old trick that Ug-Qualtoth hates' to make this work?
---
Usually for me it happens when I haven't been to the area in a while and then all of a sudden I set one foot just a pixel into the region and bamm
---
Never take junk into an event, especially this one. I made the same mistake the other day, I didnt lose flux or anything, but i had a fair amount which i needed. I was annoyed, but I'm not salty about it - I knew I shouldn't have done that, but I did. I simply forgot i had it on me when the event notification came up. Wasnt until I died that I remembered, and by that time it was too late (luck was against me and my game crashed when I respawned to rub salt in the wound).
---
It's too easy to see that notification, get excited to do event and just go, forgetting to stash the junk before going. We've all done it.
---
I wonder how many people in the community want changes to throwing weapons.
---
Yee, that sounds easy for them to add. The weight and damage increase would be great.
---
Also u/dlbillions delete div 2 and get back on fallout, comunity needs you man :D I need you, this raid may be hard, if it will work. haha
---
Lol poor bastard. Shit happens
---
Hmmm... I have one toon that has not left his CAMP in the Savage Divide for weeks bless him.
---
Will try with him tonight, see what happens.
---
I still think there is something messed up with the dailies in The Mire though. I \[mostly\] consistently get dailies in other regions although some seem 'rarer' than others but these ones... nah.
---
I agree with you 10000%,
---
historically, updates start at 8am Pacific time (11 eastern time) and complete in 2-3 hours.
---
It's rule 7.
---
It's not enforced.
---
A weapon that is god roll and does not sporn anymore like a blooded explosive tesla rifle
---
I was aiming at having people that play the game on a regular basis to tell me what's been added that makes the game better, not go and read an article. I've read about the new dlcs and stuff. It was more about what you think as a community, but okay, I'll just go and read that if you say so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I Had this at the beginning of the game, where parts on a chassis just disappeared in the box
---
Brad from accounting always leaves the damn password to his computer on a cassette tape in his desk drawer.
---
wait explosive tesla rifles dont spawn anymore?
---
Its a 3 star effect I got 2 tonight alone.
---
if it gives an advantage to a paying player over a none paying player then is considered as P2W
---
Oh gee, thanks a lot mate. Imma go ask her then
---
Oh hang on, I‚Äôll roll over and see if she‚Äôs awake
---
I had lost my x-01 torso and t60 right arm from my chassis quite recently. I was wearing the PA and was disconnected from the server, then I lost them. Those parts are painted in black bird skin so I don't think I sold or dropped them by mistake. I suspect the server disconnect is causing the problem.
---
they're explosive energy weapons for the most part, which sucks since the explosive flamer is a blast. It's got insane range and accuracy with the explosive bullets it shoots. Sadly my only one is level 30.
---
Do you happen to be on ps4? I had similar plans with my streak build, strength in numbers
---
Explosive energy weapons are currently the one legacy weapons. As if was seen a one that fire and laser could explode like explosive bullets. So they were removed from the drop table though Bethesda did say something about adding something similar
---
But explosive tesla rifles dont arc they hit one target and explode.
---
The best reason to play again... is to see if you want to play again.
---
Tell me about it i have only ever played the game solo. No one i know got the game and i Don't want to pug anything. 
---
I Don't even have the "join a group"challenge done and i have been playing over 600 hours across 3 characters.
---
Still gotten at least a couple hundred 3 stars and never seen. And I get good rng on weapons. I just dont get it.
---
yeah, it sucks all my friends are in the states so my playing time with them is limited due to the time zones, need to find some ppl to play with on our side off the world. 
---
sorry that you are playing on PS4 ;) lol
---
Like I said 75-100 damage may not seem like a lot but in quick amount can down plenty tough things. I got a 3* knife off of a Mirelurk. With just knives and sneak throws.
---
I don‚Äôt think they need a change but just more options to be useful to all play styles. They aren‚Äôt meant to be main weapons or kill SB or big game stuff but really to aid you in the task of killing. 
---
I‚Äôd still say in pvp a few knives or tomahawks to be really good for saving ammo or getting that close to people.
---
i did the Breach and Clear event twice today for the lead and both times all of the boxes were empty (i was the only one doing the event)
---
I can‚Äôt remember the exact details, but there is an inoculation quest that had something about animals in it. You had to collect blood samples from a ghoul, wolf, and mole rat. I think they have some level of immunity, but I‚Äôd have to read the terminals again.

i5 6600k @ 3.5 GHz is the minimum requirement.
---
The graphics card in those is comparable to a GeForce 730, so running in the lowest possible settings/resolution and in fullscreen **may** work.
---
You'll also be at half the RAM for minimum requirements.
---
All in all, it should run but it'll probably take about 10 minutes for your character to load in and another 5 to open the trade window if you don't CTD or completely freeze.

Oh man, if she's awake, please wake her up cuz she's late for work!
---
I lost a full x-01 set with shocks and jet pack during this patch üòì
---
Oh jeez, if she's still asleep, wake her up cuz she's late for work!
---
Don‚Äôt worry, she already earned her 15 bucks.
---
Oh? And how should I have built my PS4 differently? Rig is 100% out of my control and standardized.
---
As for my internet. I was playing in a group of 3 with a husband and wife who were in the same house and share the same internet obviously. She and I disconnected 3 times at the same time while he didn't. Then he got a blue screen (ps4 speak for crash) while we didn't. Later I crashed as well. All that happened within 90 minutes. Probably under an hour. The 3rd DC was enough for me and I didn't rejoin their world.
---
I reboot the ps4 daily if you think that matters. And its system software is up to date.
---
The game has serious bugs. Denying that doesn't solve anything. Don't be a shill.
---
They want trades so that they can dupe them and add to the collection.....we have been deceived by Bethesda about the the account suspensions....that‚Äôs just to shut us up. The real problem players are the ones who dupe seriously and they are still out there.
---
I know it was tested around release, but like I said it could have been changed. I'm sure someone will jump in and say it was changed so Beth could sell us these repair kits.  :-)
---
That is true.
---
Oh nice, 15 bucks for 5 minutes is a pretty bargain!
---
make pacifist active and dont worry about it, I believe that they are the select few that tried PVP mode and got recked so the hid their tails between the legs and jumped back on aventure mode to mess with ppl. I dont really mess with PVP but i do know how to pvp so every time someone tries to they get recked lol.
---
Do you btw think it would help to just unfollow people ?
---
What can I say, sometimes I like to dumpster-dive. Keeps me humble.
---
Yes, because some people just don't know when to move on from an unfinished game.
---
Yeah. Thanks. I may give it a shot. Should only take about 3 hours. All updates take 45-60 min on PS4 after the download is done. Even the 500mb one weeks ago.
---
Theres the issue. Consoles are shit at sharing NAT tables.
---
Sounds like you've got packet collision issues.
---
Setup one console with port forwarding. (Eg remove the others from the network)
---
Issues gone? Consoles suck at sharing with eqch other. Enable uPNP.
---
Lighter armor makes less sound and passively increases stealth.
---
Pocketed adds pouches onto your armor for +5 steez points.
---
No. They were sharing an Internet connection. I had one all to myself several states away.
---
I have 2 computers on for 7+ hours logged in on my off days. haven't had many DC issues since pre-patch 5.
---
Why does everyone wanna blame their crap networks on devs/ISPs?
---
Such a nice Liberator üò¢

---
the problem with caps is the 25k cap, I for one have to buy random ass mods or plans that I will never use to keep me under that 25k cap
---
You accidentally ate somebody?
---
Thanks for playing. But seriously, yes, get back into the game, it gets better every week.
---
I know it's a dumb question, but for real, I just wanted to know what regual players find interesting enough to get someone to go back to the game.
---
And it was pretty nice to play along, gave me a nice five minutes while at work
---
I've got a max level one of those badboys. I found that and an explosive cryolator the day before they got patched out. They're both amazing fun to use.
---
That was not a funny joke
---
Dope.  More of this, less of everything else posted here.
---
lol, you would need to a wolf companion
---
You can play 200h without getting what you are looking for. I feel you. Playing for 500h+ now and I'm still missing 2 pieces for my leather set
---
Is it still being launched today as I've seen nothing about maintenence etc?
---
I'm so ready for the dungeon!! Add me on PC for dungeon runs tomorrow :)
---
IGN: Premonitor
---
Having 125k or 250k means caps are still basically useless to me.
---
Random loot "gamble" vendor, ' like every other morpg since the 1900, is the real fix.
---
Gives us something worth spending caps on.
---
I've blown 25k in 2 days on assaultron boards. And I'm getting 50% of the drops on sheepsquatch with no legendaries. Its still better than queen drops lol.
---
I just did this exact thing! A yellow quest marker where the diary I already picked up was. 
---
So you're saying it somehow fixed itself?
---
[](/celestiahurt)My jealousy is beyond imagination. I still haven't found one Cryolator that's worth a damn.
---
Read the wiki find the terminal and you'll know all the plans. Ultracite PA plans used to be SBQ drops which is where you got the torso plans.
---
i was just looking for info on this (which was surprisingly hard on mobile) and every source said april 16th so yes, it‚Äôs supposed to come out today
---
I have a bloodied cryo for sale
---
Doesn't always work tho, anybody understands why?
---
Lvl 135 Sentinel Rifle build, also PS4. Looking for a group as well.
---
Yes when I went back the note was on the ground and I was able to finish the quest.
---
Hopefully its comming today like they said,but im kinda afraid still dont see the announcement about the downtime today :(
---
You got me curious. Check  [this.](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/334432/wild-appalachia-patch-notes-april-9-2019?language%5B%5D=en)  
---
* **The Burrows (Coming April 16):** Explore The Burrows, a new subterranean dungeon that offers a challenging experience for even the toughest of Wasteland adventurers.
---
It was probably part of last patch, same as fastnach event. Maybe there will be no maintenance and event will start at time when patches comes out, so 4pm for me in europe.
---
Not 100% sure tho.
---
I‚Äôm having severe freezing issues since the last patch, and after speaking to many people who is sharing the same problem Ive got into a conclusion. There are two factors contributing to freezing issues on ps4. Number of friends, and Bethesda .net account. I don‚Äôt know how the latter is related to the freezing issues but my freezing starts as soon as the sign in is complete and Bethesda.net is paired with the game. I‚Äôve contacted bethesda to maybe unlink my account prom psn but they haven‚Äôt responded yet. I‚Äôm sick of lack of support that i got from bethesda officials, this is just horrendous.
---
Yes, The Burrows update will be available later today (16th April).
---
You can read more about the update on our [Bethesda.net article](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1QMBfEfLfsdy3ho9eYMoQ0/inside-the-vault-the-burrows-and-camera-preview)
---
My PA arms up and vanished I'm glad to know it wasn't something I did.
---
Is it coming out then? Says end of the month on website.
---
It takes a while to spawn it. Patience.

---
[](/celestiawhat)I can't do the bloodied thing(Which sucks since I've got a mean 3* bloodied Gauss Rifle). I panic heal the moment I fall below 80%. Kind of you to mention tho.
---
 [Check my comment  under my post. Just theory, but seems real.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bdre9v/ps4_today_is_the_day_we_all_are_waiting_for_new/)
---
Harpoon is a heavy gun vats sniper rifle and only works when used appropriately.
---
It‚Äôs only good with quad explosive and fletched mod.
---
Im doing the bloodied thing now, and I‚Äôm just like you. Its really fun and op
---
Not just Rhododendrons. There are a couple of Snaptail Reeds that either never turn into their nuked versions, or only one of them and they can't be picked.
---
Was this dungeon part of last patch and will open at 9am america time without downloading any new patch, or will there be any maintenance?
---
I‚Äôve got a TSE Gatling Laser that‚Äôs a fuckin godsend
---
im down to help, usually around 3pm est to whenever I feel like going to sleep, add me gamer tag is the same as here
---
To cite just one recent example: in the latest patch the recipes for certain cosmetics were changed to make them more costly to craft and the 'selling price' slashed and this is nowhere to be found in the patch notes.
---
Whether it was a necessary adjustment or not is besides the point, the point is that they have a long history of undocumented changes and this is fertile ground for suspicion.
---
I find it disingenuous that you chalk this down as a 'thing of the past' when it keeps happening and without community patch notes to provide a counterpoint is actually hard to pin things down because even though the tools to decode the game files are publicly available the time and technical expertise are not.
---
A lot of perk cards will just turn off due to the server not realizing they are equipped. Take off all cards and put them back on and it should fix your problem.
---
Hey. I haven't played for 2 months. Playing again for 2 or 3 days now. I'd suggest to wait a little longer
---
There are new quests which I really enjoyed! And a new "endgame" boss(you need about 3-5 good people).
---
But after I finished the quests and did the boss 2 times, I felt kinda lost again and didn't knew what I shall do now...did a queen(she is still kind of glitched/bugged) and a whitespring nukezone.
---
Tried PvP-server but it feels, well... It's fun dont get me wrong, but you'll still die in less than 3 seconds.
---
They stealth nerfed the flare gun. I used to be able to one shot the queen with them.üòî
---
Bloodied explosive can also be ok with flechette, over 1k damage with your perks listed (minus stabilized)plus 5 in explosive expert
---
Lately? It's always been like that Imo
---
For Encrypted they're all good, they make that event so much easier.
---
i lost my excavator torso a while back..2 days ago my friend lost his xo1 torso and jetpack
---
Lost like 100+ springs &amp; other good junk the other night.  Lol shit happens, man. Gotta remember to hit that stash before going up against the robo-beast
---
Thank you kindly :)
---
That was real sheepsquatch texture on deathclaw model. Which someone datamined, noone found real sheepsquatch in game and nobody saw his real model.
---
lmao she's still doin this? Dang
---
After today dungeon opening queen will be forgoten. Nobody will ever try to kill her again.
---
So should I pump more perks into damage? Or are there some vats perks you would recommend? I really feel it's just lacking in damage, but I'm willing to try a variety of things, as I have a ton of levels saved
---
10%dmg vs players 10%dmg while aiming +resistances while aiming(not sure about the last one)
---
It takes some getting used to. You learn to accept you're going to die a lot. My bloodied is melee so every fight with something big like a deathclaw is a duel, first hit wins, which does add some excitement. I couldn't do the sniper thing, too boring.
---
 [Here are all legendaries from survival, for past and future weeks.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/QtVQlF3lmGXkLAZ8GV4VJ/inside-the-vault-survival-mode-beta-overview)
---
From my understanding it only works if the player is downed as opposed to dead dead.
---
Ah, thanks :)
---
it would help if you know moderators did just that, but it looks like they only come out too jump on someones throat when someone says something negative about them. 
---
so more than likely this will get deleted and I would get band for a week. 
---
see you next week guys LMAO
---
The guarantee is coming next. But I'm waiting for the action hero the week after. 2 shot .50 cal with faster fire rate and reload speed lol
---
You are welcome. :)
---
1 stim pack can equal 8 diluted
---
Flechettes harpoon is both a shotgun (it shoots multiple pellets) and a sniper rifle. With four leaf clover perk, each pellet has chance to fill your critical bar - as a result it usually fills the bar in one hit. The best prefix mod for this gun is definitely quad - in my experience the first shot staggers and the second one kills. Four leaf clover then better criticals and you should be doing fine. Luck first, heavy guns later, my cavalier toon is sporting quad explosive flechettes harpoon gun, zero heavy gun str perks, max luck and its super powerful.
---
Thanks, that's what i said but i still get downvoted
---
If they have to respond on everyone who have some problem like this, i now understand why it took so long to make some content.
---
Hey thanks for the reply!
---
I see... I will try my hand at the new quests maybe during Easter and wait a bit more before actually diving in with a new character
---
My friend :D says that there are multiple occurences of situation when enemy is downed yet the execute prompt is unavailable
---
I'm a bloodied build and use be shotguns.... I blow myself up a lot...
---
I know it's already been added but they normally have to shut down servers to make the content go live. We'll find out at 4 I guess, I'm in Europe too.
---
i got a few in the past few days, hard to get tho thats for sure.
---
No dense torso mod? They're kind of a must.
---
Ah. Well in that case I have no idea! üòÇ
---
Not for the Ultracite laser. It does less damage than the normal laser but fires faster. Idk about the gadling version tho.
---
In case of fastnach event there was not any shutdown. Robots, ballons and other things just appeared at time of patch. Yeah, we will see at 4 :)
---
Kinda wish you couldn't at least get lower than two stars items since it's easier to start. Three for the queen.
---
Don't have plans for combat armor üò™
---
Nope.
---
Mods that you do not know currently can't be used. IE the ones purchased from stores.
---
My axe does the same. You can repair it, but then it disappears from the list.
---
Can also only inspect one weapon at a time and have the information visible.
---
I [encounter](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=717308889) about four times as many 3\* than 2\* enemies. Indeed, I started seeing 2-3\* more and more once I entered the Mire/Bog. Still, their loot drop is disappointing star-wise. I'm lvl 165 at the moment with Luck 10.
---
What format are you on? If ps4 I can hook you up.
---
I never farmed Watoga hard. But I visited the vendors enough to score a few legendaries at a decent rate...
---
This is definitely a stealth Nerf... They also altered at least 1 random event spawn location that I used to farm for witches outfit
---
Huh. In my experience I have difficulty hitting anything far away with the flechettes mod. I'll give it another try though. I'm really trying to find a heavy gun version of a hunting rifle rather than a combat shotgun, which is why I'm trying to lean away from the flechettes if I can help it.
---
Similarly, quad is realistically not happening, I'm trying to avoid most if not all player trading, and the fact I got a remotely good leggo drop was insane enough odds already. 
---
I'll give that a perk build a try though, probably with the reload perk as well. (since no quad) Seems interesting.
---
My friends and I thought it would be cool if they added something like the borderlands system with true and ultimate vault hunter modes, you could join a harder server for increased legendary spawns or something along those lines
---
They made enough money to get more stuff. This is just sad.
---
he didnt stole anything, you died you dropped your shit and now is gone. 
---
a frendly recomendation, store your shit before you go to an event that is famous for ppl taking your dropped loot and you knew 100% the you will die. so you should be mad at yourself and redirect that fuck you back at you.  or maybe change the fuck you to "I am dumb ass for not storing my shit before going to the event". 
---
there i fixed your post for you, and you are very welcome. lol rock on and now I ask you do you play xbox if you do i can help you with the flux.
---
So you think they should just add content on a cracked fundation?
---
Dis mine now.
---
Can u give us some Time for today ?
---
Maybe we downloaded it last week and it will just unlock today?
---
Hey there, could you DM me your support ticket number so I can make sure this gets reported correctly?
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£ take care of it. Put it to some good use
---
that makes sense, though the axe was always there in the past mod or not.
---
Two shot means no aiming permitted, spray and pray or vats. I think purposedly avoiding trading is the greatest possible handicap one can choose, but you do you. Quad 1* aint infinitely expensive and does the trick aswell.
---
GMT + 2
---
Destroy bases
---
I hope so!:)
---
IDK but I aways get it.
---
Halleluyah! No more ctd, bsod, blowing up gpu!
---
I don't want to argue with you, but i never saw anyone here with same problem as you have. For me fo76 work better than any other survival sandbox game i had playied, so yeah i want new content, which i will get today probably &lt;3
---
Did you tryied storing those purtifiers, placing them somewhere near, or make another generator and try to connect it from other side?
---
Stay tuned... Some friends and myself have a theory that we might encounter the real sheepsquatch in the burrows. We shall see, though.
---
This is probably because the sentinel and cavalier part of its name often get superseded by other tags (usually the first star one). so something can be cavalier or sentinel without being named as such in your inventory.
---
"Death by squirt gun. I'd love to see that on his tombstone"  
---
Yes that was a good one!
---
My progress on Key to the Past got reset a while back, and when I reported this they just sent me a walkthrough of the quest. Couldn't decided whether I should laugh or cry. Cannibalized teammate in my confusion.
---
Sneak with gauss will blow most players in two shots. Explosive one may broke even sentinel wearing pros. 
---
But any weapon can be mortal with balance bethesda did. I have kinda good 200lvl character and 8lvl put me down with two shots from shotgun.
---
None of the rules are enforced. The mods don't care.
---
Synths are everywhere I tell you only a synth would disagree
---
Oh yeh. That's today isn't it? Well depending on time zones.
---
Ah OK. Makes sense now.
---
So realistic. Part of the story that wifes never fully understand.
---
I'll be on to run it I'm bloodied unyielding sniper myself lvl 216 or something like that psn is Sin__Phenom
---
That's pretty insane. Yeah level doesn't matter really. Gear does however.
---
It's just a dungeon. Not a raid.
---
I've been to that bear countless times and never noticed the hanging bear üòß
---
I‚Äôve always believed The Fixer had a hidden perk ‚ÄúTwo Shot‚Äù because of the sound of the bullet(s).
---
Now that 20% confirmed it, since two shot is a 20% buff.
---
I find it funny that the guy who used an exploit to penetrate fortifications reports an exploit of fortifications being indestructible. TBH the guy definitely put more work into his clever fort than you did to penetrate it. You are also witchhunting. Don't think of yourself as righteous please.
---
It will still list required materials, but the button will say attach mod instead of build, if you have the mod in your inventory. It won't use listed materials.
---
It is all about being invisible and unable to be VATS'd ==&gt; therefore being a stealthboy build has to be the best, but most expensive build.
---
Seems ages ago lol. I remember the event going live later, about 7ish, but don't recall about shutdown. I'm looking forward to it anyway.
---
Oh you have been inside? cool. I can't edit post title, so whatever.
---
I hope it is. A group finder would be nice for people with no friends too
---
In what system do you play, I'm also in Germany, and would love too find more ppl to play with in this side off the world.
---
This is too funny. But seriously though, I have done the exact same thing. People be thinking I‚Äôm some sort of cannibal out there
---
That's all fair (although the sniper scope has been 100% acc ads in my experience, vats has been all over the place tho)
---
The only reason I'm avoiding trading is because many of the weapons that were duped early on were just dispersed instead of destroyed. Maybe in a few months I'll trade for weapons, as the chance of getting one that was legitimately obtained will be significantly higher.
---
Thanks again for your responses. I'll definitely tweak it a bit with what I've learned
---
Gosh I hope so too!  It‚Äôs a missed opportunity if so, and it‚Äôs not an event, it‚Äôs a quest line so people shouldn‚Äôt be able to join!
---
i definitely hope it wont be an event based thing, the new encryptid event‚Äôs cooldown is bad enough with the 3 or 4 hours. lets hope it‚Äôs something you can just do whenever with your own team and not have to worry about cooldowns or respawns
---
Not if your quick and let it in enough so you can slip by it and get through the door.... it's v risky but you can actually do it

Its just a interior scene everyone can join by climbing into one of that manholes. The place is horrible big and filled with ghouls. Everyone is going to find some place to loot. People already glitched into this and saw everything of it
---
You have some leeway when the event first starts.  
---
In the future, make a pit stop at Lewisburg station if you have to. I travel there to drop junk and swap out cards before I hit the event.
---
I tried yesterday, went to fissure prime after nuke, and the event didnt even triggered. The event marker was exactly above fissure site prime, walked very close to it, but it didnt start.
---
We had a nice fight with the queen, but I guess nobody was able to see the timer. So we ran out of time and she ran away.
---
Lol this doesn‚Äôt answer my question.  But thanks!
---
Yea posted it because this is all we know so far
---
Well if you don't experience the bugs i understand your desire for content. Its kind of a hidden talent that i run into every bug there is. Maybe i should consider working as QA Tester \^\^'.
---
The purifier problem is only one of the lesser ones. a few weeks ago i continuously glitched through the map, and both Wasted on Nukashine and the new Lying Lowe just disappeared mid Quest.
---
reporting these bugs and how they trigger, would be a full time job. but i just want to play.
---
I did try that, i even conneted them parallel and in line to see if it makes any difference.

I've got weightless marine and chameleon sentinel chest marine. I can use that? What kind of weapons?
---
No I know, I read that guys post a while back.  I don‚Äôt think 24 people in a server going down at the same time is productive that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm hoping each team is separate and when you enter in there it switches to a different mode or something.
---
the legendary vendor is coming next month (23rd?25th?). Might be a good time to start again.
---
There are weekly unique weapons (1 per week) in PvP mode. Maybe you should take a look at those, bethesda has listed past and future weapons that will be given out.
---
Yeah i experienced a lot of bugged quests and even some that just disappear and are gone forever.

Happy cake day!
---
Yes, I know that but I was asking if anyone has heard any other chatter other than Inside the Vault and someone asking if ‚Äúit‚Äôs still coming tomorrow‚Äù.  Like any moderators or people talking about it.
---
Wenn du willst, kannst du mir einen Text in der Xbox schicken, meine GT-ID ist die gleiche wie hier. Sobald ich zu Hause bin, schreibe ich dir zur√ºck und ich werde dich auch meiner Freundesliste hinzuf√ºgen
---
All online games that are still receiving updates are unfinished. WoW for example, PoE, Black Desert Online, ESO.
---
TSE have fallen somewhat from grace since bloodied has become the number 1, but are still in fairly high demand.
---
So you can get a good amount of caps for them, def 10k+.
---
Are you planning to sell yours? i've been looking for a good gauss :)
---
I'll try and play some cuz luckily the 25th is a holiday here! Thanks a lot mate!
---
Thanks. Now I want a plunger next to my toilet üòí
---
Welp, I know where im going today
---
Join one of the player made discord factions. There's a brotherhood of steel one for example with internal quests and bounties on certain monsters. Not normally my thing but it work really well in this game.
---
Knowing the time would be nice for those leaving in Oceania, NZ, Asia. Always better to play the same day mentioned than the next day after everybody...
---
And I‚Äôve been saving a spooky time mr fuzzy üò≠
---
Hey man I got three great news for you because the future is now.
---
Lets talk duping. In the times when duping vas prelevant, the world in which we fought was world of slap damage. It impacted severely how the trading market looks like, and the items that were considered the best now are still considered the most expensive but their actual combat effectiveness is often much smaller than their price tag. TSEs were nerfed since then, and when the duping was rampant, it was all about TSE assassin sentinels. Ignore those and you'll  remove 98% of duped loot from your trading searches.
---
Then, math of the game has been changed too. Many weapons that were irrelevant previously now are combat-effective. Pretty much every gun is worth retesting and serves a purpose where its good now. This means that there are weapons that are not TSE, are not the next obvious big thing BE, but are damned godrolls when its combat effectiveness is considered, and you can still get them cheaply. My friend has scored a gun I'd give 4 BE weapons for, and he payed measly 1200 caps... These were often considered trash and sold to vendors when people were duping.
---
Third, the problem with duping was that there were certain people who flooded the markets with their stashes. Their stashes have been reduced to one piece, they suddenly lost access to infinite supply, and lots of them were banned. Duping methods have also been hunted and were mostly removed since. This further reduced the issue so now its marginal (if not nonexistent).
---
We are already living in post-duping economy, its just the majority is unaware, as they often refuse to learn the market because they don't want to get their hands dirty and be anyhow associated with dupers and their work. But I'm very deep into all the combat effectiveness research and trading and I assure you we have already reached that point.
---
Weekly weapons are already available, in case you thought they'll be added next month aswell.
---
Exclude PA from the equation, the issue discussed is nonPA vs nonPA
---
i got 31k 5.56 ready for this, lets see how much i burn through
---
You can also cure diseases for free at whitesprings, there is a sulfur drinking fountain in the gazebo near the tennis courts outside the golf club. The drinking fountain will cure all diseases, and remove dehydration with no rads
---
no point using them together.  
---
Weightless = invisible when crouching and standing, no noise when going invisible
---
Chameleon = invisible when crouching ONLY, noise when it activates
---
both the above stop working when you move
---
Stealthboy = always invisible even when moving, but stealthboys are expensive. If you are just going to camp in 1 spot and wait for people to walk past, then you want Assassin+Sentinal armor (4 pieces - will cost over 100k caps) and 1 piece of chameleon sentinal (cost about 20k caps)
---
 [Found this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bdirb1/so_ive_been_reading_on_the_burrows_that_come_out/)
---
I did wait to see if another one starts when one is full they did not.
---
Any video?
---
No I haven't been inside, but they literally said it's a dungeon
---
I'm glad i have the chameleon sentinel already. Thank you for your advise!
---
Oh rad, I‚Äôm not the only one wondering.  Sending luck in the world that it is!  ü§û
---
Handmade are good it‚Äôs all about DPS and vat crits to their face
---
Cool mach ich, dann k√∂nnten wir vielleicht heute den neuen Dungeon machen.
---
It‚Äôs filling this sub with shit
---
Lost an x-01 helmet , didnt scrap it, didnt drop it, was missing from one server hop to the next. Damn targeting HUD mod took me 3 months to find. Sux. When is item locking coming?
---
Hmm that's odd then i have no idea
---
Anyone know Is there going to be a maintenance downtime?
---
Im PvPing a lot and about 75% of my downed targets cannot be bid farwell
---
Yeah I didn't know the Excavator armor increased how much ore you gather until today. Tbh, there's really nothing that I can see that says that other than comparing how much ore you pick up with and without the armor.
---
Ja, machen wir es. Ich spiele normalerweise nach 2000 Uhr. Kinder lassen mich nicht vor 2000 spielen. lol
---
Ja kein Problem da spiele ich meistens auch.
---
Thats on purpose bro shut up
---
ok, dann werde ich dich heute sehen. was ist dein GT?
---
Beth plx
---
Bethesda needs good suggestions, not just bug reports.
---
Some of the best changes and additions to this game originated with member suggestions, so suggestion posts are no less deserving of their own individual threads.
---
Yeah. It was. Def a bug if it disappears after you repair it
---
LordGeneral4k
---
The fifth shot from your combat rifle should deal as much damage as the fixer. With consecutive shots dealing more. It depends how many shots it takes to take out enemies.
---
i jokingly call my posts "dear Bethesda" as a nod at these people so every title I have made here for a suggestion starts with it
---
thanks.
---
True about the sticky threads. However, we can have a page separate for bugs. [Just like the BethesdaPlz wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz)
---
Heck, if the person (I forget names) who writes the bug threads has editing access, then why not give access to whoever makes the bug threads.
---
Great!  thanks.
---
To be honest it doesn't seem to be such a hard dungeon. &lt;- famous last words
---
The screenshots showed ghouls as enemies. Ghouls are pretty much the easiest mob type. Even worse, the screenshot showed ghouls under level 42... 
---
Here's the screenshot itself. 
---
https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/5mo3vo3VNgrR7MzA2FLCUe/18e4bc27e4fa589206609ffb9409ea06/FO76_TheBurrows_5_1920x1080.jpg
---
Even if those are the lesser/weaker mobs, the difficulty can't be much higher than a nuked whitesprings and whitesprings glowing ghouls are easy to one shot...
---
Bethesda said it will require 2 lvl 50 with good gear to complete it. 
---
By now lots of people are way past that level, we had the time to fine-tune our builds, and the gear is not good. It's mostly insanely good. It's not going to be anywhere close to sheepsquatch or sbq level. Those are designed for large groups, this dungeon is for 2 lvl 50 players.
---
^^^ This is how i'm motivating myself to avoid being a social person and team up with someone. Going to do the dungeon solo.
---
It is a waste of stimpacks to revive yourself or other players in that event.  When I am downed I immediately give up so other players do not waste their stims on me.  That gets me back in the fight quicker.
---
Any Two-Shot sniper weapons are trash. Second projectile just won't hit the target unless you're really close range
---
(Are you referring to this?)[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/revisions/bethesdaplz]
---
We can see who has been updating the list, but I don't know if people check the sidebar to begin with ...
---
Let me ride a scorchbeast!
---
Nope I actually ran around with a level 200 , i agree its tougher as a high level.
---
Really? For some reason I thought it was the transformation being rejected leading to them being petrified but others fully transforming
---
Do you need a full suit or just the arms to get the ore bonus?
---
Ill need to time convert for myself but i and hubby might be down depending. Will get back to you.
---
I didn‚Äôt know you could travel to the future!!Hey doctor who wants his/her tardis back!
---
I WISH quests would work like this more. Did you complete the quest ? When I had one bug out and tried to follow it (the one with the two girls up north) there was no way I could progress and just had to relog. Went to the house, found the note, then we were just walking around town and the daddy ghoul runs at me. But after it all nothing progressed.
---
Not trying to insult here but this is also not proof. This is literally the same as every other post with ‚Äúdata‚Äù pulled from one source for a very limited amount of time. I‚Äôm all for proof and discussion but most of the posts talking about the nerf have no actual evidence and are just users counting their legendaries and going no that‚Äôs not as much as it used to be.
---
Send em a ticket, what you got to lose ?
---
Is it the one with the actual sheep? I'd give you 500 for it.even right now
---
Not strange tho since they stop attacking you after you‚Äôve done ‚Äùmayor for a day‚Äù. Was just waiting for this to happend. It shows the poor game design, first it was farm legendaries al a diablo style. Now when they plan for dungeons and raids they start to change the way to earn loot. lol
---
Just seen confirmation by a cm that it goes live today :)
---
I should have all the mats. Can you play at 17:00 ET
---
There's also a Reddit, but it has some pretty bad offers. Doesn't mean you still can't get one.
---
This just made my day. Lol!
---
Stealthboys, while expensive, does not guarantre maximised combat effectiveness and good hunters are often able to deal with such enemies across various distances.
---
The best build is the one that fits the composition made by build, gear, playstyle - times four, because it also has to be supplemented by a team.
---
It can be indisputably proved the above sentence is true. Builds that are perfectly aligned with teams are the best builds. You can have up to 15 additional special points for perks in your build if you do that, compared to base 56, the 71 is much more, but thats not even the maximum effectiveness.
---
For stealthboy based builds, its also cavalier set thats shining, not the sentinel.
---
Yes, it happens. The reason is that the client thinks you are still hidden/caution and applies the double damage but the server thinks you are in danger and thus the double damage gets overruled by simple damage. Whether if it is due to lag or that the server uses a more basic line-of-sight evaluation is beyond me.
---
There are rummors about sheepsquatch as boss on the end. Whatever i am hyped about new content.
---
Look, if they admit that then they can't claim they forced Bethesda to fix it when they get a string of good luck with the RNG. This is the only way they can feel powerful, they *need* this.
---
Wow, That's some good advice, Thank you so much!
---
I have 800 steel, you're welcome to it.
---
It'll be a long time before it's on game pass.
---
I laughed when people complained that you couldn't drink out of toilets in FO4. Just no.
---
Your a good guesser! I‚Äôm not really a stealth sniper build but I do use stealthboys! I need weightless though in order for my character to actually move around because without it I‚Äôm always over cumbered. And yes I‚Äôm a two handed melle build buy the strange thing is that my super sledge that‚Äôs heated only does 300 dmg... it should do a lot more then just that... also is Asdassins compatible with the main effects?
---
you will lose all of your photos fyi
---
Same here! I still only managed to see two that week and I play a few hours most nights.
---
I don't really have much to offer, i have some 2 shot weapons and that's about it
---
Learning armour mods is much harder to do in comparison to learning weapon mods.
---
Didn't know about that.
---
Sounds like a lot of extra effort, possible abuse and potential for catastrophic bugs when I can just trade with my friends in game.
---
I get where you're coming from and like the idea, for sure, but an ancient engine that was never made for these kind of interactions probably can't handle something like this. (Prove me wrong Bethesda, by all means)
---
What's a QE harpoon?
---
Well I don‚Äôt crash anymore , they added pvp servers and we get a new dungeon today so there‚Äôs that
---
Iiiiiiii honestly like that idea that OP put forward.
---
I was running a trio event early one morning (not survival) and we were rocking. All I got was a locked game near the end when I died. 
---
But I've done the event at least a dozen times and that's the only time it froze on me.
---
And you had to walk uphill both ways, in the snow, with no shoes, and black lung. lol but seriously, I love doing quests on my own without the help. I turn the tracking off a lot of the time
---
Haha no way i love my ps4
---
If you are on PC, they made  [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151) working again, best timing ever if we need to team up.
---
Way to stealth correct his stupidness üëåüèª
---
fyi, you will loose all of your in game photos, so screen shot any that you really like.
---
You can not pick perks until you see one you like. You get a new pack every 5 levels.
---
Quad explosive. Does the same thing but four times per reload. Reload is also quicker.
---
Yes. That's crazy good.
---
Most likely the lack of bloodied builds. I've been fights in Patch 8 where she fell in 3 minutes twice within 5 minutes; there was a team of bloodied 5k melees there. Another time, it took 26 minutes, no bloodied as I could tell, but I spent a lot of time clearing mobs around me. Afaik, there has been a change to the queen in Patch 8 where she now doesn't scale but has a flat damage reduction to 30% (i.e., 100 damage registers as 30 damage), irrespective of the number of players.
---
I'm using a Hunter's Handmade and crouch all the time; the 30% damage seems to help against SBs &amp; SBQ and sometimes she forgets she sees me so I get double damage. Once I get a Prime semi-auto Receiver, I'll prime that rifle for an additional 30%.
---
So like a lvl 91 deathclaw, maybe harder. Should be easily do-able solo. And i do hope it's the real sheepsquatch... that skin looks so bad ass.
---
I suggested atleast putting it in their stupid login announcement board
---
i had to do it lol
---
I've started to experience this ever since the latest update. Maybe it was there even before the Shear Terror update and I hadn't just encountered it.
---
Hm ok that's nice but how is that better? With a TSE dragon you can can a ridiculous amount of damage
---
I would like to see them go the extra mile and instead of skins sell cosmetic packs that let armor pieces look like other armor pieces. It would be neat to rock full heavy BOS gear but be able to make it look like leather or raider for the aesthetic.
---
For selling, I use chemist and super duper and I always have about 200 normal Stims on me, so when I would do my vendor run I would just throw on butchers bounty, farm some ticks, and craft everything down to diluted.
---
Also, they've helped me a lot with panic spamming during the sheepsquatch event.
---
With so many people not grabbing the pylons, I find it easiest to just be in P.A. grab all the pylons and stay out of the fracas. Use the Diluted stim to stay alive and I don't waste my stims for when I really need them.
---
FWIW, I did solo the queen (empty server) a few months back so I definitely got the last hit, yet the challenge entry didn't unlock.
---
Yea that was me, most fun I had in a while btw. Haven‚Äôt seen that molly wholly ( what did you call it again lmao) go down faster then that. Also If you guys are going to do the event again I‚Äôm in!
---
It is a bit fustrating since it is a very basic game mechanic on surcical to eat and drink
---
Assassins is a prefix effect so it can't appear with weightless, Chameleon, unyielding, etc.
---
My first interaction with another player was similar. Dude gave me tons of plans and recipes. I always pass my known recipes and plans to other newbies as well.
---
I am on PS4. I can‚Äôt remember your psn because it happen so quick there was a guy in the event named nova something and girl alicethe something.
---
Everything has a chance to spawn legendary but there's way more effective places to hunt them.
---
And camp stuff ... For now I just build in raider-themed locations for decent results.
---
I think it will climax with us finding him in Ever Upwards. But if all the quest are linked to Sheepsquatch, then nukashine has to be involved. Perhaps there is no Sheepsquatch, rather a drunken goat.
---
Not sure if it's still a thing but you could paint a full set, minus helmet, of t-51b in brown camouflage without buying the skin. And it's still in my stash.
---
perk cards are locked down to level,some cards will be avilable after you lvl up, after lvl 50 you can move skill points around how you want, or you can pick a perk card you want. 
---
as far as lvling up every card to max with one character sure it can be done, just ask a 300+ lvl the should have most if not all maxed.
---
i am at lvl 115 and i have max the cards I use, but far from maxing every card.
---
Oof. Well what would you recommend?
---
Are you on Playstation? If so I'd like to team up, I'm lv91 but looking for people to play with
---
Yes it is being released today, although Bethesda's official Twitter is being awfully quiet about it. Normally they comment the day before saying the down times and stuff like that, but nothing has been said by them about that.
---
Bethesda guy here confirmed it is coming out today. I have theory, it will apear at patch time without any maintenance, like fasnacht devent did.
---
for me, it was excavator, t51 and t45 parts
---
Strip the flesh, salt the wound!
---
I know. I was just wondering, cause it‚Äôs there everytime.
---
Site Alpha has a relatively flat top, if you're ready for a bear fight.
---
This is actually a really good idea. Although for the sake of low level players, it should stay out of the Forest!
---
Purpose is to one shot things. A tool that one shots eight things is superior from a tool that oneshots one thing in the same time. The damage will indeed be higher on the dragon, but you don't need infinite damage, you need enough to kill an enemy.
---
Besides harpoons advantages of magazine, fire rate and reload, it also has infinite ammo supply as it produces more ammo than it uses with flechettes mod, and its pellets style shots load the vats crit bar to full in one shot if you have four leaf clover perk. In raw damage dragon wins. In one shooting contest QE harpoon is better.
---
Agreed

Na theres a smaller update today that adds just one dungeon.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/3xpopYq.png](https://i.imgur.com/3xpopYq.png) \- but this one is absolutely amazing.. it's pretty much unobtainable! :D The rarest animal in the kingdom of FO76. No idea how you got all that good stuff..
---
Same story except blue screened 10 times in a row trying to log in. I am now waiting 10
---
Hours to redownload everything completely.
---
It's better to work off the logic that more enemies means more likelyhood of finding a legendary. That's why Whitespring is so popular, lot of enemies. I'd recommend Harper's Ferry as I've gotten a few nice 3* from there.
---
I did perma freeze yesterday while opening a terminal. Was gonna go back to my camp to stash some junk and join some high-levels in the blast zone since they launched like 10 nukes in 30 minutes. Had to force quit the game, and ofc couldn't join the same world. Was so frustrated...
---
This is one of my favourite thing to do. Find a low level and stealth leave them stuff.
---
You want bloodied explosive, bloodied vatscrit, bloodied firerate, antiarmor vatscrit or antiarmor firerate rifle.
---
No, actually. Only 3 stories to it. But it took a long time for me to get everything right where I wanted it lol
---
No, but it's being added for the update that adds the in-game camera. We'll be able to mod it at a Tinker's Workbench.
---
I guess they just implemented the mod/repair menu for the Tinker's Workbench early, or you got a bug that made it show up.
---
I don't think that's supposed to be there, but I have it too lol
---
I take pics of 3-5 people on the sever and rejoin using usernames
---
Hurry only a few hours left.
---
Thank You.
---
This is why "join the last world" should totally be a thing and not random luck
---
understandable, but I still think some of the weapons, at least the Broadsider, need a large damage buff. It's a low AoE, single target-type explosive weapon, the only explosive weapon that does that, besides the horrible Quantum nuke nades, and worst off, it does less damage THAN the nuka quantum nades. If the devs want this fella to be such a single target monster, then it's gotta play the role, and that means more damage, which sadly, it just...isn't cutting it right now. And these bugs with the explosive weapons are just adding even more to the frustration on them, it's sad.
---
interesting to hear, please tell me if re downloading the game worked for you
---
Teddy Fear does not approve and will haunt you in your dreams.
---
I use an anti armor armor peircing slegehammer. My all rise needs too many repairs even with artisan and it does at least 200+ damage with perks and mutations
---
It started at 23 hours to redownload 2 hours ago. Now I‚Äôm at 10 hours left.
---
They had no troubles getting the golfist ghouls quest finished
---
Same. Ever since they announced it I've been stockpiling every legendary I find. It's becoming a bit of a strain on my stash space.
---
The Wacky Wastelanders.
---
We're hopping around in ridiculous outfits, taking goofy selfies, deliberately mutating ourselves with experimental radioactive serums (or just casually hanging out in toxic waste), launching nukes for fun, getting drunk and wasted on chems, killing other survivors and eating their corpses after wrecking their camp, doing the same repetitive things over and over again... what else?
---
I have 4/5 sentinel armor and i thought i am weak. I store it at stash thinking i will wear PA. As i was traveling "naked" i finaly realized i can't be without my beautiful armor.
---
It‚Äôs not really pay to win , yes you can pay for it with real money from rogue sellers on eBay but the vast majority of people attained it with caps from sellers.
---
Not really. You pick cannibalism long before that point, you fuckin' scumbags.
---
smh why did you even equip the perk at all? It's not like food is hard to come by.
---
I think I‚Äôll actually do level 20. I have all the mats for it I just checked. Does 17:00 ET work to get on?
---
You should remove this users name from your post. It's basically witch hunting 
---
&gt;The owner(name removed), and I have a previous history; he was spawn killing people outside of the Charleston station come Survival mode release.
---
This type of speculation by definition is witch hunting. From what I read this player did nothing wrong. Though I'd like to see the spring trap set up. (Not becausr it's an exploit but because it sounds clever) If anything you were griefing by constantly destroying the generator just to piss this player off.
---
TBH it just seems you don't like this player and are trying to drum up hate towards them. Seriously you saw they owned a workshop you knew you didn't like them and you decide to fuck with them rather than walk away.
---
Now edit the post to remove the player name please.
---
You'd be suprised at how many players are paying to get flawless sent assas gear. But the even a little bit of p2w is bad, because it reveals that there is an unbalance due to those very strong items
---
Craft some nuka grenades and throw them at sentinels... they have to move if they want to survive. Don't forget to equip demolition expert rank 5
---
I can confirm this. I purged over 300 people from my friends list and it‚Äôs much much better now.
---
P.S: if I deleted anyone who reads this please don‚Äôt take it personal
---
Ehh. FYI majority of sentinel/assassin people are freefrags for seasoned PvPers. The fact you are attempting something that is effectively countered to break through armor doesn't make the armor unbalanced, it only makes the attempt futile. Assassin sentinel without stealthboy is useless against seasoned PvPers, and even with stealth boy there are certain tactical situations that must happen within their team if this armor is to have any value in PvP. A tip for you is that vats crits pretty much completely ignore this armor.
---
I don't mind removing Assasins, since I didn't and won't play PvP in this game, but f... off from sentinel - it's very useful for PvE. And I didn't spend a cent with real money to buy anything except the game - all caps and items I got are fairly traded.
---
They can still survive when standing still, I've seen it. You could probably kill them following up with your weapons, but the point is no one should be able to survive standing in a nuka grenade, especially without power armor
---
Definitely odd. My ticket had been addressed in about 24 hours. Two confirmations followed, one for the original ticket and one for the 500 atoms being successfully added to my account.
---
If the loot of the events ruins the event for you, then fine. But I care less about the loot and more about if the event is fun. Fasnacht was a blast and Sheepsquatch is a hectic time. I like them both.
---
The update should come today, as in the Inside the vault it said 16th of April along with a Bethesda comment saying on another post that it'll come later today. I feel that there will be maintenance. as a couple days ago they did say this update will have bug fixes for things such as not being able to use mods on anything. It may come out at a normal time like 3pm (Uk time) or 10am EDT
---
There are counters to sentinel assassins. Plenty of counters
---
Of course its useful, its the strongest effect in the game. Its even better than assasins in pvp, thats the problem.
---
500 LOL nah the set is being sold at like 8k everywhere
---
If you ever have the itch, do another playthrough! Play everything in the story and Automaton, then do Nuka World, and finish it up with Far Harbor. 
---
Seriously my favorite way to play.
---
Play smart dude.... if your enemy has to stand still for not receiving dmg you have to take advantage of it. There are plenty ways
---
The fact that you would have the need to counter them only proves my point.
---
Single bullet
---
Throwing knives and tomahawks are fun. Not super useful but fun to use.
---
Well thats interesting
---
It's not the problem, I play PvE only and I'm fully against removing sentinel affix from the game.
---
Huh? Every build has a counter. What you talking about
---
Can you temporarily disable the mods and try it? Since you say until recently, that could mean that one of your mods is not compatible with the new patch.
---
Just because you use sentinal armor for pve doesnt mean others that are too.
---
What kinda pen you use?
---
Build? This are effects you can gear up on with any kind of build
---
I think west tec is the best place for high lv legenderaies. Theres at least 1 3* there most times. Had 3 3* in one run once.
---
just because you have no luck/skill or time to trade for Ass/sent gear doesn't mean Bethesda should remove the affix from the game...
---
I don't think the Nerf was to Watoga but to bot legendaries in general. Dyer and robco used to spawn 2-3 minimum per run. Lately I've been lucky to get one.  I can't think of any reason this would be intentionally done to this level so I'll assume it's going to be fixed with the next update or two. 
---
Especially since other species nearby the area still are spawning legendaries (Super mutant, insects, ghoul, etc) I'm hopeful this is just a bug or bad interactions with some other code.
---
I hope so, out side from the player vendor, dungeons/raids was the next big thing I was waiting for. 
---
BGS have been real quiet today, I really hope it still happening today.
---
Then why are some frozen like they just got hit? Some guy was just prone on the ground with his arm raised long enough to be turned into a petrified corpse?
---
I really dislike fast travel. I want to make a start on survival but I'm just put off by the top 3 player markers and the ability to freely migrate between modes. Kind of defeats its purpose.  
---
I wish they added something more immersive like a functioning train that you pay caps to ride. They've already got train stations and tracks in place. It could have opened up the door to more events like repair the train and repel raiders attacking the stations or trains.
---
How do you think it looks?
---
Hype
---
Yes, your build. Sentinel/Cavalier Assassins, Sentinel/Cavalier Unyielding, Life Saving, Sneak/VATS crit, Chameleon, etc. Good players use a combination of these to make a balanced build to cover many situations.

Go to glassed cavern. Sprint to end room. Down the scorchbeast and loot all the dead creatures the final room has. Its a nice additional reward for clearing this boss - each of those bodies have a chance for loot. I spotted few prime receivers and grenade plans while going through them daily. Takes less than ten mimutes when you get effective, regular rewards are acceptable, and additional chances for loot make this location interesting.
---
You really think im saying this because in jealous that i dont have the gear? I have both sets, and I can tell how much easier everything else becomes.
---
Just because I almost need the luck/skill or time to trade for the ass/sent armor for pvp not caring about pve, means that Bethesda should remove them
---
Actually I think level does matter, but in a way you might not expect. Perfect example being the last character I made in Survival. He‚Äôs level 21 currently and has had a level 5 assassins auto 10mm pistol since around level 5 (thanks Leader of the Pack!). As he‚Äôs leveled up, I‚Äôve noticed my PvP weapon of choice (spam VATS headshots with rank 3 concentrated fire) is taking more and more hits to kill other players.
---
Granted I‚Äôve done no actual testing and there‚Äôs plenty of other variables to consider, but it definitely feels that way. Fortunately as I‚Äôve leveled I‚Äôve pumped up my agility to get more action points so I‚Äôve been able to get more crits in per engagement.
---
What you don't like it when people spoil everything in the title and slap a spoiler tag after it all?
---
But it‚Äôs still not p2w , just because a fraction of players buy something doesn‚Äôt automatically make it p2w, anyone is able to buy it with caps which can be easily gotten.
---
I always get rid of my .38 ammo and fusion cells by finding a lower level player in flatwoods then dropping them off about 200-500 rounds of ammo. 
---
Someone did something similar to me when I first started so I'm happy to do it for others.  Good to see I'm not the only one out there üëç
---
Yeah maybe limit it to the nukable areas so the "safe" zone in the forest is out of bounds for it
---
Every single Bethesda Fallout game has had duplication exploits that involve the item-&gt;item trade menus. I assume that's why they removed that style from the engine and went with straight caps.
---
But almost every build involves one of these two effects, thats the issue here. Lets remove assassins and sent legendary effects from all builds. It would be a lot more balanced, and every build more unique.
---
You just have to press the quick stim button twice. And you don't heal less.
---
thats a good point, ill have to look up how to disable them, ill just delete them all i dont need them
---
You can have your opinion, I have mine - I completely disagree with you. EOT.
---
That's good and I acknowledged those, but it's not the same as one anchored in the game as well.
---
Yeah run away.
---
Pretty sure it is speculation from no where. The Refrigerator idea was mention in a post in the same paragraph as the repair kits. There is nothing to indicate exactly how the legendary vendor is going to work, let alone that the atom shop will be involved in any way
---
40k+ caps isnt easily gotten. Only ones who could easily get this much are the high level vets, which still doesnt help the balance of the game. 
---
Just because only a fraction of players can buy these items to have a crazy advantage, doesnt mean they arent buying in order to win.
---
That's a pretty neat explanation :)
---
I know your pain man, lost my ‚Äúall rise‚Äù with a miss click and didn‚Äôt realize until too late. My friend was a bro though and gave me his
---
Yeah! And indeed, it's quite odd that they've been so quiet, normally Bethesda Support Twitter would announce the game going down the day before at a certain time, but so far nothing, so I guess we can only speculate. Though they did tweet about a ESO update recently hmm...
---
Yes but I just wish you didnt miss the point
---
"And he died in my arms"
---
Should be nerfed. It's pretty broken to get legendaries from robots that don't shoot back.
---
Lol and for what reason? It's a simple drop from a farmable event.
---
It 's not like a specific 3 star legendary.
---
Morons overpay without even thinking.
---
Then i have 4 nuka dark recipes, i say it's 10k since...who knows i just want 10k.
---
It's not like you can easily drop it everyday.
---
"Cant be without"
---
My point exactly
---
I'm going to hit the burrows solo. I haven't found anything in this game except SBQ and Sheepsquatch where I needed a team. Even SBQ and Sheepsquatch I play as a lone wanderer because people always show up to the event.
---
I got 'The Fixer' as most i believe... but it was lvl 30 :( wht is up with scaling, i was lvl 100 at the time and i really wanted it at 50 since i run rifle/sniper build.... But it is cool AF for sure...
---
I love you for this, but that doesn't mean that I don't still wish it was currently part of the game, and I hope the factions play a slightly bigger role than just pvp
---
No, I miss the point in your opinion, you have no right to say what is true and what isn't, so your opinion is as important as mine - the fact you want it to be removed doesn't mean you're right and I'm wrong (or miss the point) - it's only your opinion of the subject...
---
I got the i7 16gb SP4 and for the trading purposes it does just fine. Its not super enjoyable experience, but you can definitely farm some exp while on the airport like that.
---
Comment section is trying to help you but it seems like you don't want it
---
I personally rock a keg. I'm also disapointed all the comments were deleted
---
Bad man get smashed!
---
The one with the actual sheep has a very low drop rate and who cares if they pay high it's the market and lowballing 500 isnt going to help this guy at all 
---
And it's not very easy to farm this event honestly if you dont wanna pay the price go farm it yourself bro
---
I'd stop wasting my time with explaining the game to him. He isn't listening anyway
---
Sentinel is very useful for PVE too though. If anything I‚Äôm okay with reworking the mechanics
---
Damn sad story mate 
---
It‚Äôs kind of really interesting gameplay j believe, cuz that type of stealth is amazing in survival do ur silent job and get out
---
Do u stream? I‚Äôd like to watch ur plays
---
Considering you don‚Äôt get caps for killing someone until they‚Äôre truly dead, they don‚Äôt drop loot until they‚Äôre truly dead, and the downed player can choose to ‚Äúgive up,‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt seem like it would be very risky griefing-wise to allow players to revive downed hostile players.
---
I‚Äôd like to see this change too as a fellow friendly survival player who usually plays solo.
---
R/fo76bearhunt
---
I thought it was just the arms, so I figured I'd make a suit that has Excavator arms, T-60 legs (for cheap repairs), Ultracite chest (for DR) and an X-01 helmet (for those sweet glowing eyes). Looked great, tricentennial/prototype/Garrahan paint pretty much matches, everything was set.
---
But alas, mining returned but 1 ore instead of the 4 I was expecting.
---
 [I said run away. That is my tactic agains people with godmode gear.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4RcHQJBzr4)
---
You are taking this way out of context. You missed the point in my opinion? What? I meant you didnt see what i was trying to argue. Yes its my opinion obviously, i never said it wasnt. The fact that i want it to be removed is just my personal thoughts on the matter.
---
Profit formula (as seen with excavator):
---
Hold off selling skins for a certain type to create demand &gt;&gt; introduce low value skin &gt;&gt; skin sells great because of the crazy high demand and low supply &gt;&gt; introduce a really nice skin for the same set &gt;&gt; skin also sells great because it is high quality &gt;&gt; profit because you sold both skins instead of just one.
---
It's just supposed to be positive. I haven't had any issues and you can always come back here of you want to complain.
---
This is my guess, too.
---
There‚Äôs a spot overlooking Flatwoods and the vault-tec agricultural centre, it‚Äôs high up in the opposite hill close to a small homestead.
---
There is a lot of good points about how this could be abused. Which is a bummer because I'd love this feature. Maybe if they just limited it to aid items and ammo with a weight cap on how much you could send. Along with not being able to send items until the previous ones have been accepted or rejected.
---
When i had SBQ farming group i could do 5k caps on her per day. + 1400 from vendors. +selling flux and legendaries that i got to other players. Caps are easy to get.
---
Wonderful. One more thing for me to cleanupWonderful. One more thing for me to cleanupWonderful. One more thing for me to cleanupWonderful. One more thing for me to cleanupWonderful. One more thing for me to cleanupWonderful. One more thing for me to cleanupWonderful. One more thing for me to cleanupWonderful. One more thing for me to cleanupWonderful. One more thing for me to cleanup.
---
I am. This guy only mentioned pve, but didnt address how these effects affect pvp, even though he doesnt take part of it.
---
I'm almost 300, and I'm not even close to finished to maxing out cards. I wonder when they'll finally add more as promised.
---
That doesn't explain how the ultracite got there or why the animals don't petrify does it?
---
There are ways to beat the assassin's sentinels (not that I think those are the only two things in their build/arsenal giving you trouble). Maybe you don't like them because you can't run at them in your power armor with your minigun, but that doesn't mean they are unstoppable. 
---
And remember someone will always be better than you. Taking away some armor prefixes doesn't make that go away. May be some of the same guys, maybe not. Lucky for you, right now you know who it is and what they're doing. Look at the game and devise a strategy to beat them. It's there. Other people have figured it out. You can, too, or you can keep grinding out those caps, join them, and have some other player come along and teach you the weaknesses of that gear by killing your ass. Either way, it'd be great if you'd stop belly aching into the ether about the unfairness of it all.
---
-someone who doesn't have Assassin's or Sentinel armor
---
I traded a really high end three star armor piece for my impostor outfit. It‚Äôs worth what people are willing to pay, I guess.
---
The problem with removing sentinel is that a new meta will become unbalanced. Bloodied would be too strong, VATS too good
---
Can i also add a bit to your idea? I would love if there was a certain kind of weapon and armor to be dropped from weaker mobs and higher tiew and atrong weapons from bigger more dangerous mobs, it would give an insentive for those who lets say are looking for legendary light armor they would hunt in the forest specifically for mongrols and such and for tjose who want a black powder weapon or even a handmade to hunt big enemies like legendary deathclaws or ecen mireluk queens
---
If it's the market ,then i'm helping the market realize it's not worth 8k.i still laugh at it.  Obviously i'm gonna farm it myself.
---
Thats what I just mentioned, using weapons after throwing the grenade. My point is that he shouldnt be able to negate 60%+ all that damage at all, standing still doesnt make much a difference compared to trying to dodge because of vats anyway
---
ok i deleted everything i could see relating to the mods, the game is running now, although i still have one mod that i can see is working but i thought i deleted it :/, thanks for your help!
---
Hey guys, maybe y‚Äôall can agree to a change where legendary gear no longer spawns with both sentinels AND assassins effects? 
---
Why can‚Äôt we just get along? :)
---
Bloodied weapons would be a bit nerfed from the loss of the tanky effects, and vats would stay the same, because sentinal armor users stand still - meaning you can easily hit them with or without vats, but they still negate your damage either way.
---
Youre right a new meta will come, but it cant be any less unbalanced than the current meta.
---
Yes! I almost took a screenshot but it was 4 posts with "Bethesda Please" in a row.
---
I can imagine it now how big it is.
---
I think it was just coincidence, that button inside the portapotty is an elevator that you use to get out of a nuclear silo. You probably just pressed the button just as the random encounter spawned
---
Do you think they turned down not legendaries not to nerf watoga but to reduce the legendaries in the lying Lowe finish with the sheepsquach?
---
You can get plans for raider headlamps.
---
Yeah, usually it's around 2pm ish here in the UK, we shall see.
---
If it helps, they've chnaged the top 3 from 'time survived' to 'player kills'.
---
People keep saying this, but most times I never find one..... wth
---
The cliff above lucky hole mine is flat, and the one above that
---
What's a better place to hunt them??
---
Yes they‚Äôre buying to win pvp , but it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre un-killable .
---
&gt;plus , it‚Äôs one of the only things you can wear that stops you from getting one shotted by some variation of an explosive weapon , if it‚Äôs balance you want , maybe try there first.
---
&gt;But then again if you removed S/CA armour , every pvp encounter would be a one shot kill as people‚Äôs builds would still be as OP as ever.
---
No one likes hitting a fat man nuke, blasting an entire clip, or throwing all your grenades to end up not doing much damage at all as they stand still and shoot you down as you try. There is no other perk or build that would allow you to tank this much without power armor. If you think it isnt fair, then what makes it fair?
---
Those 5 points are used for your armor's weight mainly maybe if it reduced the armor's weight as it would be more worth.
---
It seems that you are hell bent on disregarding everyone else's point while trying stubbornly and desperately shoving yours. Sen/Ass/Cav/etc are all end game gear, the best amongst all the lot, it is what a lot of players save/hunt for (you can be included in that lot). Removing them means removing an aspect of the game thats meant to justify long hours of grinding, sure you can argue they're sold for real cash but that's no reason to punish those that are legitimately saving up for it
---
Also, just north of lake Eloise, but you‚Äôll get scorchbeasts
---
I'll send you an invite mate, I'm Theopeo ingame
---
Unless they're the conduit.
---
Cool! Any idea when it will release? :)
---
I asked for clarification (IIRC, it was between replies 1 and 2), and before I went down the path of color-blindness.  Your first statement is contradictory because you said no one did, and then that I did, but I called her out for being a turd.  That was in an edit, so it's not like I came out swinging.  That edit took place almost an hour later.
---
My history was hit 4 times.  Twice associated with comments she responded to, which were deleted, and twice for comments she didn't respond to, where I thanked someone for clarifying or stating that OP wasn't clear.  Once comment I deleted as I acknowledged that OP meant something else, and it hit -10 within an hour.
---
OP told people they were wrong and then regurgitated the exact same words she used previously.  Any calls for elaboration were either ignored or aggressed.  The comment I responded to asking provided the context on which he based his decision, which is also a call for clarification.
---
And again, the attacks you're citing happened after OP began stonewalling all conversation.  remember that '13 hours ago' is composed of 59 minutes.  factor that ambiguity into your assessment.  You don't get to just arbitrarily re-order those events to fit your narrative.  I was here the whole time.  You're looking at it in the past.
---
And again, people asked for clarification.  you even admitted it.  Those are the oldest.
---
Could I have handled things better?  Sure.  So could you, and so could she.  You're not nearly as impartial or have as omniscient a view as you seem to believe.
---
I actually found a China Bear from a location in the woods.  Forgot where.
---
Do your grandparents still do the moonshine business? :)
---
Oh I'll do that if I can. Thx
---
Accurate walking cane ;)
---
That's because it is already in game and does not require a patch to implement.
---
Yup
---
Ah ok
---
I just want those elephants
---
If you are on xbox, hit me up for any group stuff.  Gamertag is glenn4moose.
---
All things must be put up verrrry carefully.
---
yep getting the same thing...went to a lot of work to get the pure violet flux I needed, tried to apply the final calibrated shocks to my Excavator...ZERO.  Left leg modded fine before the last patch.  Even get the audible tone indicating that the mod was applied, but nope.  THANKS BETHESDA!
---
servers usually go down around 4pm my time so in about 2 hours. It will probably be down for 2-3 hours after that so expect it to be up at around 7PM GMT  
---
Aside from that I have no idea what to expect from the burrows so will be fun to try it!
---
I wanted those elephants
---
Lol.  It‚Äôs the most important one cause it counts astwo.
---
PS4 and PC
---
I'd like to team up if you are on Xbox 1
---
Cool! See you later then mate!
---
I'm guessing it's the beginning that takes the most time.
---
Removing entirely would cause the need for multiple chances imo. A rework/nerf would be the best option. But truly I think it‚Äôs fine as is
---
Troubleshooters protest sign
---
Exactly, I also have a thing of not wanting things to look *too* perfect, too squared.
---
I fuss about with small details and how lived in a place looks.
---
You need to search inside and out. They mainly spawn in the research wing.
---
I think I have a plan, I'm on pc
---
I seriously doubt this will be hard for anyone with a brain.  Even if every creature was 4x as strong as the average scorch beast, it would only be time consuming, not difficult.
---
Until melee in general, and vats crit builds are nerfed to at least 50% of where they currently are, or other builds are buffed to where they are, difficulty is something that will not exist in this game.
---
Maybe.  Even then its not really that important.  If you are the conduit and die, you simply go and grab the same conduit again.  It takes seconds from the place you respawn.
---
If anyone needs a battle buddy on PC, hit me up
---
sure, lets remove ALL the legendary gear, so everyone will have the same gear and we change f76 to regular death match shooter...
---
Don't you see!! The mannequins and yard gnomes are using the bears to lull us into a false sense of affection for inanimate objects. 
---
And when we're all warm and fuzzy towards them.....voom! Out come the machetes and molitovs and we're all skeletonized in a bathtub!!
---
Group Photo!!!
---
I read somewhere in this Reddit that it's the Chest piece that gives you the bonus.
---
No they are not unkillable, i never said said i just said its a heavy advantage. 
---
You can't validate fixing specific op few items by using other specific and few op items - the whole point is to be rid of them otherwise the game is never balanced.
---
Youre right, tse is a problem but lets say those explosive weapons were removed first. One shotting with these will be a lot less common, so now the problem would be nerfing the bullet sponged armor. So whether you start there or with the armor first, it doesnt matter.
---
People's builds dont have to be OP, they can be balanced and tweaked. But you have to start somewhere
---
Gives me a reason to whip out my gamma gun lol. It also allows for epic fights when equally matched and it‚Äôs fun as hell.
---
If you're on PC I can mod you all parts to BoS for small fee.
---
Yeah, I noticed this too. I actually only want the polymer mod for the colour, would you believe!
---
I've scrapped every piece of combat armour I've found for the last month or two and I think I unlocked 'Ultra Light Build'. Really. ONE mod, in dozens and dozens of scraps :/
---
Great counterpoints and well put! The one bit I think OP had right tho is removing level caps for certain creatures (e.g., mole rats cap at 21, mole miners cap at 40). It‚Äôd be awesome to see other enemies up to level 90 like the rare high leveled deathclaws you see every once in a while.
---
The assaultron was made in hopes of luring the sheepsquatch out for mating. So it must exist, we were never meant to discover it... yet.
---
Xbox
---
That's a generous offer, and I appreciate it, but I'd rather not have to track someone down every time I get a new piece, especially repeatedly trusting someone not to run off with my legendaries.
---
Very glad to here
---
Omg! This is one of the funniest comments I've read in a while. You've made my day ;D
---
sure, it's always better to have it for yourself. But you don't have upgrades everyday, so it'll give you time to get plans for yourself in the meantime having best mods.
---
Aaah no spoiler here- but found a terminal that mentioned speculation of something similar.
---
I haven't found any consistent location for 3\*s. [Post Patch 8](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=1121097906), Prime and Blackwater mine have decent 3\* drop chance, but it is offset by how often you can do both. Next is Harper's Ferry, followed by Whitesprings and West Tek. Overall, the [3\* chances](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=112052096) are disappointing so far.
---
Spawns are likely handle server sided.
---
There's no update today as I understand it. The new content is already installed it just 'goes live' today.
---
Am i the only one with this problem? I would really like to do this quest..
---
Thank you for bringing this up.
---
After over a 1000 kills in Watoga since the update I have witnessed ZERO Legendary Bots. I used to see 3-4 minimum per run through the streets, hospital, bus depot, and others. Now nothing at all. I recently played the Census option on a bunch Gulpers. Finally a 3* Legendary and after killing it and running to collect my prize it DISAPPEARED!
---
Again I don‚Äôt know if this is just bad code or a nerf. All I know is what used to be a good resource is currently gone. As are a ton of activity in Watoga as I‚Äôm seeing fewer and fewer players. Sure it could be because of the newly added game play. Yet for now Watoga is useless except for collecting supplies or going for the Queen IMO.
---
Ok, Im on the west coast, so I won't be home til 19:00 et
---
I'm a PS4 stealth sniper and I'm also looking forward to the new area, but I'm really *mostly* here to say how envious I am of your Instigating Gauss Rifle.
---
How many rifles did you have to scrap to suppress it, if I can be nosey? I think I've scrapped about 20 :/
---
This is a pretty good write up without involving adv. Power conduits, take my upvote good sir and/or madam.
---
What platform are you on?
---
I can see almost a dozen legendary enemies when clearing whitesprings.  I never see less than 3 now.  Legendaries are everywhere, not sure why you're having such bad luck.
---
Why does anyone think they know what this game is going to be like?  There is zero difficulty so far.  Unless they make everything 1-hit KO you, the same AI is controlling the same braindead enemies that cannot touch you unless you forget what mitigation perks are.
---
Worrying about shit that they have literally failed to deliver actually being delivered is a waste of time.  This will be easily soloable with any good solo build - except stealth ones due to the confined space.  Not that they're very good anyway.
---
Im sorry you have that assumption, but im just trying to make put down my thoughts on thoughts on the matter. I have been listening, but just because i havent been convinced doesnt mean im ignoring and disregarding other comments/opinions. Its not just late game gear, but my arguement is that it is a heavily overpowered gear which is why it is so meta. Yes there has to be something for everyone to grind for, but it doesnt have to result at the expense of the overall game or pvp balance.
---
This isnt about punishing those that have saved up for it, its about taking a step to tackle the balance issues
---
yes I have found it
---
Underground‚Äôs are dungeons, the vaults opening up are RAIDS.
---
Experienced perma freeze several times yesterday when exiting different workstations.
---
I'll hold on to it forever, It does break pretty fast though :/
---
Yes it can and will spawn as legendary sometimes.
---
I can't say I have, I'm afraid. 
---
May I ask what occurred that made you realise you were in survival?
---
Very nice, I'm hyped to get something good for once.
---
I have been holding on to some shitty ass 1* weapons just so that I can scrap them for the token system. My inventory is so heavy and I had ran out of stash space the moment they increased it
---
Or actually have Marine armor worth wearing...
---
Learn to stagger them or shoot them with VATS crits. Staggering them means the sentinel is not in effect. VATS crits bypasses all armor. Learn about the armor before you complain about it. They have to stand still. There are ways and perks to make them stagger. You cannot go all gung ho running all up in there. Unless you're melee with cavalier. Bleed them out of stims if you have to. Those guys don't carry many. Also, power armor sucks compared to lots of armor for PVP.
---
An exploit or an in game feature that can happen quite by mistake to anyone? Lets not Pick and choose battles here bro you and I both no the games not perfect and im reporting flaws in the game that you dislike the fact i am bringing to attention.
---
I ran out of caps and i could not spawn anywhere i rejoined the server. Its not hard to do when you have some base I.T. knowledge
---
here we go with an other me me me me me post.
---
learned, adjust and move forward. just becuase you dont like it, it doesnt mean it should be removed. I saw atleast 10 post telling you how to deal with them.  and yet every response you gave back was on the same line, not wanting to learn is part off the problem.
---
Still don't have suppressor for it and don't need one, when it does 270damage without multipliers.
---
But if you really want farm weapons to open all mods, i suggest you, to build camp next to lake in which supermutant behemoth have spawn and farm him by server hopping.
---
SOLUTION: Go play survival mode or stop fast traveling in Adventure. No one is making you fast travel.
---
I would also like to know and if it's an update or have we already downloaded the content.
---
On my PS4 account I‚Äôm the same way but 2-3* only
---
Is it just me or does it take FOREVER to scroll down to 200 rounds. I would probably give more out but it takes so long lower levels usual leave before I can drop any.
---
Legendary robots stopped spawning in Watoga after the last patch. Used to be a great farming spot and now nothing.
---
Frag mirv is my go to, farm standard frags off super mutants then convert them. I think the plan drops in junkyard events.
---
Same here. Nothing in Watoga.
---
Yes! This happened to me last week..lost my jetpack x01 torso. POOF just disappeared. Luckily my buddy had one and gifted it to me.
---
Oh I don't have anything against reporting this stuff. My problem lies with specifying the nickname of said player and maybe involuntary but organising a mob against them. Joining a server into location works as implemented. Destroyed traps work as implemented. The truth is what you've both done was using consequences of some mechanics to gain advantage over the other. This is why I think you shouldn't consider that player as anyhow worth reporting. The trap issue - worth a report, maybe. The player report here, on the other hand, makes you the villain. Please clear it.
---
Dungeon is today not tomorrow.
---
Yep, mee too, due to lag... I even saw the warning. It sucks.
---
4Head JUST WALK LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
---
.50 Cal and LMG needs skins as well. They should make a heavy weapon skins bundle
---
I think the cryptids were supposed to fill that niche. You can only find the Flatwoods monster,  Mothmans (other than wise), and Grafton monster by exploring the map. Grafton tho is pretty easy to find. They should add legendary drops to the Flatwoods monster and implement more mini bosses like you said
---
Here's the thing - most of your available counters and attempts are futile. Crits work its what I use too, but they can also crit me without having to rely on them to punch through any negated defense. Its not armor, its a total and overall damage negating by a percentage that reaches up to 80%. You have few options to eat through this, if you dont have a crit build you could gernade them, but they can also chew you as you throw it and they tank the grenade. 
---
There are other counters too, and they are definitely still killable, but why is such a huge damage negation needed in the game? Why does it need to be meta when there is soooo many more builds in the game?
---
Sounds fun. But I've never had that. =P
---
That will be a sad day. The ratio of good / junk legendary items is so much better at West Tek.
---
yeah, we might have to wait until 2040 for them lol
---
Judging by the fact they haven't said a word about it since it was announced, I'm guessing canp decirating isn't ready.
---
I do know how to deal with them, but whether i do or not is not the point of the post at all if you read it right.
---
Why farm Watoga if there are no legendaries? The only thing of value left is lead from their corpses but I would rather spend less time mining lead ore instead of running endless circuits to kill bots.
---
Have fun with it and, if it doesn't fit your build/playstyle, DON'T sell it, but trade it for the weapon you want. You can get pretty much every TSE/AAE weapon for it.
---
8k is nothing now. There are people with 100s of thousands of caps.
---
To say something isn't worth caps in this game is dumb. Caps are easy to obtain and have no real value. Almost all trades now are exactly that, trades and not purchases with caps.
---
Are all you on the same platform?
---
I'm PS4, and cannot say I have experienced this....and I have been in excavator full time since before the patch.
---
I haven't seen any since the patch as well and thought it was bad luck. I did run into the gutsy squad yesterday so that definitely real. Figured they needed to add some danger to an other wise quiet spot. Outside of random scorchbeasts
---
No.
---
How would you prove it then since you obviously have an idea of what is and isn't proof?
---
50 DR while aiming
---
Probably leaderboards popping up on screen
---
I just got nocturnal apear
---
But them from armor vendor whitespring resort
---
That's an interesting point, though I have seen legendaries at that event and not a single one at Watoga.
---
ah, im on xbox
---
If there is any downtime, it's usually around 2-3 hours from now but it's been proven that the area is already in the game so it could just be a case of them activating it like they did with Fasnacht.
---
I always walk to the places I go, other than fast traveling home when I'm done. At first it was to save caps because I was poor, and it still is to some degree. But mainly it's to see the world. This is a wonderful world they've created, and some of the random events are entertaining, so I like seeing them -- like a group of super mutants taking on a Grafton monster. If the walking is getting too far, I move camp. Maybe I'll get tired of it at some point, but so far I haven't. I always seem to see new things even on well worn paths.
---
I even do this in Bethesda single players games.
---
That what I named my Explody Gatling Laser. Sucks, dude. I'd be devastated if I were to loose it. Hopefully, some day we will be able to lock every thing in the favorites wheel.
---
yeah, I am not 100% certain on how the new system is going to work, but it sounds like you can cell legendaries and get coins in exchange. and use said coins to either add or change a legendary on another gun.
---
I hope this is how the system works. though idk if RNGesus is going to play a part in it when it comes to changing legendary effects. though it would be OP if he didnt. otherwise you could make everything a BTSE
---
There's a reason set of this costs over 100k..if ur worried about it don't pvp
---
Bethesda Softworks *Published* all those games you bought. Bethesda Game Studios has only *developed* Fallout and Elder Scrolls. For instance, id software developed RAGE. Not Bethesda Game Studios. They (id) are owned by Bethesda Softworks. A publisher. (Like EA, Ubisoft, Activision, etc...) Bethesda Softworks own a ton of devepment studios. 
---
Just FYI, so you can distinguish between developer and publisher.
---
They needed to remove legendary bots from Watoga.  You can kill them without any risk whatsoever.
---
Legendary need to be rare and fun to find, not the normal.    There also needs to be an aspect of risk to attacking legendary.... Like doing AWOL armaments.  I usually don't die, but occasionally three Gutsy will notice me and shoot me at once and I go down.
---
I refused to "farm" Watoga because I considered it cheesy and like cheating.
---
These tripped me out the first time I found them. I also found a Jangles holding a golf club with spare balls around his feet. He was standing up with a trilby hat like he was putting.
---
The explosive Gatling weapons in particular are quite odd, they fire bullet projectiles like a Minigun does, which is probably why Bethesda patched it out.
---
Lol. That reason is what im talking about.
---
i like the idea but imagine finding a lvl 91 glowing mythic deathclaw out in the field when your lvl 15.
---
Big Lizard In My Backyard
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k68Uz3w3x8
---
Yep. All that humblebrag means nothing.
---
Have they posted about a downtime? I couldn't find anything.
---
I'll add you to my tiny friends list also.
---
Same timezone and also usually play on weekends.
---
Also on vacation for this and next week.
---
IG Alerno
---
If your on PS4 I‚Äôd be happy to put elder or paladin on your T-60, I don‚Äôt charge for it either.
---
Lol i never specified which platform it was on... have fun with your needle in a haystack witch-hunt, and maybe i like being the villain i like to rp in game and irl?
---
Also you forget the part where he spawn kills people, which i have evidence of also which is also a reportable offence is it not?
---
Ok, if that was the case, I would support that.
---
I thought Todd said at pax that they were going to be instanced.
---
I‚Äôm hyped, looking for others to play with also. I‚Äôm on PS4 and Eastern time zone. IGN: waddupb_
---
Oh had no idea
---
Cool! The more the merrier! Nice to expand the friendlist! There should be an ingame chat tho!
---
I was quickly murdered by someone with a TSE Gatling gun. I realized I was in survival mode because I could only spawn at Vault 76. My camp is not in survival mode so it wasn't even on the map.
---
It wouldn't be an issue if they weren't duped by the shit load, which they were and still are.
---
The odds of finding a full set of these things is astronomically low lol.
---
Not likely to happen
---
Gotcha. I love that mine in general for vendor runs. All those shottys and gauntlets add up. Yesterday I cleared 600 caps in one quick mine run.
---
Oh, does he usually have a Gauss rifle? I have suppressors for almost all the other rifles with the exception of the Lever Action. I just farmed materials and built them.
---
I only use rifles with suppressors so I can move from mob to mob without alerting anyone nearby.
---
Good hunting though!
---
Ok, so I lost an excavator chest and I thought I just scrapped or sold it by accident, but this makes sense
---
If the train were added, somehow every object in the game would have the texturing of a train.
---
Oh the mods of this forum don‚Äôt do anything but say how great they are at doing it.
---
ps4
---
At least it has been, it could have been stealth fixed and I just never knew :/
---
What pieces do you need. I'll see if I have any.
---
You may be in for a surprise with this new update...
---
We called it the Wooly Bully lmao, we have a group chat with a few of the mainstays currently, after work I can add you to it if you want
---
Legendary spawns were nerfed tho
---
I thought I was the victim, a fellow cannibal, but you are on PS4 and I was cannibalized last night.
---
Honestly most people just ignore people who are downed in a fight, I always appreciate when someone comes along with a stimpak and actually helps me out. Even if it only saves me a short loading screen, they are good people. 99% of the time people will just walk past and ignore it.
---
They totally don‚Äôt care
---
Damm that‚Äôs weird shit - I finally got lucky and the one just outside the cave counted.
---
I would like to think that
---
True all of this
---
I think this is just an adventure mode bug. You should of still been able to spawn at the train stations
---
I hope they don't bring it down, i want to play the dungeon as soon as possible
---
I hope u mean regular TS
---
Sounds like user error.
---
They haven't posted anything about downtime, but it can be assumed it'll happen, since in some previous Bethesda replies they have stated that with this new update they'll bring in a patch for the bugged mods not applying to anything. It'll probably commence at 10am EDT or 3pm UK Time, which is the usual time it starts at.
---
It's does drop...I've had nothing since Dec and then this week, 2 x sentinel and 1 x Cavalier. Lol. Boom
---
U can ask for it on market subs to not pay outlandish vendor price
---
Whenever Todd awakes from his slumber
---
Lmao üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
What do you mean? You realize people have already figured out how to solo squatch with with level armor, as long as it has sentinel on it. You can find crappy 1 star sentinal pieces at vendors. So just put a sentinel armor set on and you can solo it and don't even need stimpacks.
---

---
Bolstering+ AP regen, left and right arm. Needs to be heavy though, thanks for checking!
---
Good luck. I did 22 events last night to get this, and for the group I was with. Only took 4 hours or so.
---
Whenever Todd wakes up
---
I can make this happen by rapidly irradiating myself by drinking dirty water after spamming "collect".
---
My biggest nightmare..I honestly am extra careful in the pipboy and at vendors..when switching between my TSEs I use the favorites menu only
---
I did read it, my first line was response to your post if you didnt get that lol. 
---
after that was just a suggestion.
---
Yeah I think this is it
---
TSEs are beasts still
---
No idea. Hit enter 4 times?
---
Your reply is the best yet, gotta love that Fallout lore. Thank you.
---
Sounds like a missed connection lol
---
Lol youre a clever one arent you? How is that a fair tactic for people to compete against? Ask yourself that and think about it long and hard einstein
---
Aren‚Äôt you tired that bethesda releases games in such bad shape that people have to constantly ask them to please stop doing stupid, greedy, lazy shit?
---
From a pond and/or from the pump?
---
Problem reading? If the second projectile doesn't hit the target it might as well not fire it in the first place. Only good on full-auto or shotgun. Unless you use it close range.
---
The southern area west of watoga always has wonderful surprises..I think I was overencumbered and had to walk from Charleston to watoga..it was amazing and beautiful
---
I'll see what I've got.
---
The canvas bag support stopped the last week of december, that was when theyd no longer take the order
---
Just from a body of water. The pump takes ages to produce water compared to a pond
---
Player vending in coming on the 7th May, don‚Äôt know about the decorating though
---
Use your imagination
---
OP has provided enough proof that it isn't happening in my opinion.  The burden of proof should lie on those who say the legendaries still exist.
---
No u goof regular TS are trash TSEs are not..if ur using regular TS u need to re-evaluate ur gameplay
---
Sounds awesome. Going 'nope' and heading the other way adds to fun a bit.
---
I once switched servers because my camp couldnt be placed onto survivam but thats as close as I got
---
***Shoot***  
---
***The***  
---
***Traps***  
---
A very hard concept for someone that isn't Einstein but trust me you may be able to pull it off with enough practice.
---
U need one ur friends ..or u need two of the same system in ur house..like 2 PS4s etc
---
In Survival, you need to loot your wood armor as fast as possible before the real chaos starts. People work together until the event ends and then every time without fail, it's a huge free-for-all. I love it.
---
I assume it will have a difficulty level comparable to that of the nuke silos, maybe even a bit higher. Definitely possible solo, but it might take longer and you‚Äôll want a lot of health items and ammo
---
Deep pocketed is amaze
---
yea ikr i remember i was just exploring ended up on silo alpha and seeing a dusty yao guai that scared me alot i was in the elavator for 10 min
---
Just start a fresh toon when you dont feel like grinding.
---
I popped open the ESM just to make sure it was 20%. Can confirm it's 0.2 multiplier with no added damage.
---
I don't have one, so I'm not sure what the description says. Maybe it says this already. Let me know if it does or screen the info screen for me.
---
It's a legendary effect in it receiver slot (slot 0) called "The Fixer" and has more than the damage multiplier. It also has "Stealth Move" and "Armor Mod Hide in Shadows". So it also increases sneak speed and decreases your detectability.
---
Here's a screen of the raw data if anyone is curious [http://prntscr.com/ncp38v](http://prntscr.com/ncp38v)
---
Double xp the weekend of the 26th. Gonna make another character then.
---
TSE are REALLY hard to come by without buying it from a duper. But after the nerf you don't really need one. TS is not as good as Instigator/Berserker, Bloodied or AA.
---
The Fallout Store had its first annual flea market on Sunday. With a great turnout we are planning the next one now. Join The Fallout Store &amp; watch the public events channel for details.
---
Rad Shield?
---
If they cant move get radiation weapons. Pumpkin grenades and gamma guns maybe a explosive radium Rifle
---
Yup agreed
---
Bloodied doesn‚Äôt do it for me in survival, tse and assassins
---
I was just saying I've had so many regular TS and I couldn't give those things away
---
Or... have them turn players into Nightkin.
---
The more you use stealthboys the more you need to use stealthboys or dire things happen.
---
Further down the line your toon goes mad from stealthboy use and starts behaving in unpredictable and erratic ways whilst still needing stealthboys.
---
Eventually your toon cannot stand being uncloaked suffering severe penalties would this scenario arise.
---
Inert flux is not used for anything afaik. And it has no value to vendor as of a few updates ago. Not worth the lbs.
---
I hope so but makes me wonder what ya know.
---
Do you know if they no longer explode immediately after death?  Can't help wondering if they fixed that but accidentally broke something else!
---
Bloodied doesn‚Äôt work for me in survival, assassins tse is where it‚Äôs at
---
OP is probably happy to be wrong now
---
yup, its doing something akin to that. I've also got a marker at the big bend tunnel,but no ACTIVE quests in that direction. It is highly likely that I 
---
have an INACTIVE quest tho.   cheers
---
Yep, I was able to finish it properly
---
Depends on what they are. But it's deffo not the best legendary effect any longer.
---
Inert flux? That what you mean?
---
If so, drink it lol. Use it for water. No real other use as far as I'm aware
---
Use it as a water source and sell your purified water instead.
---
It's definitely better now that it's been changed. Don't want to show as 1, 2, or 3, then don't get any player kills. Only problem I've had were all the douchebags showing up at events this past week looking for easy kills.
---
Sure thing, I like talking poorly about that neckbeard of a sub. My post was asking where I could go to glitch/exploit hunt the game. I asked a few other fallout subreddits, and figured I would ask that one too. I basically wanted another place to go to that wasn't that subreddit, somewhere else to talk about it, I was looking for referrals to another sub or a discord or really anything. A kind "hey this subreddit/discord/website would be a good place for you" or "sorry man we don't know" and I would have said thanks and let them be, but what I got was "YOU'RE TRYING TO EXPLOIT AND HURT THE GAME, REEEEEEEEE, IT'S AGAINST THE SUBREDDIT RULES TO DO THIS REEEEEEE" I told them it wasn't against the rules and to stop being butthurt, then they told on me to a mod and the mod took my post down. I explained to the mod that the rule clearly says:
---
"2. No explaining how to exploit
---
Do not explain how to exploit. There are plenty of other places to go if you want to cheat. **You can mention an exploit exists, but don't go into details here publicly about how to exploit.** Take it to PM or one of the many other places to discuss it."
---
I told the mod that I was simply asking if anyone knew where to go from that subreddit and that I wasn't looking to discuss the exploits and glitches on that sub. The mod kept on insisting that I broke the rule even though he couldn't explain how I did himself. After some back and forth the mod basically said something along the lines of we don't want you or people like you in the sub and banned me.
---
**TL;DR r/fo76fithlycasuals is an elitist, gatekeeping, neckbeard sub that treats the game like a mi'lady and will white knight it even if there is nothing to white knight.**
---
A blast lol
---
I'm with you, I'm the last one to make assumptions that something has changed just because a couple people come here and whine about things, especially when RNG is involved.
---
However, there have been enough people making these claims about Watoga, and no contrary information (that I've seen), that it's a legitimate concern.  I've 'tested' it myself enough now to convince me that there has been a change.  I've spent enough time farming there that I have a decent feel for things, and between my own feelings and what other people have been posting, I'm convinced.
---
What I still don't claim is that this is a 'nerf'.  Has something changed?  I believe it.  Was it 'on purpose'?  I won't say that.  WS doesn't seem to have changed, other locations seem the same, legendaries are still spawning other places, and I see no reason that Watoga would be nerfed but none of the other locations.  Hell, I had a 3-star mutant attack my base yesterday.
---
Something has changed, but there's no reason to point any fingers at this point.
---
You recieve the weapon at the level your character is usually. And max would be 45 for that sword. So if your character is over lv.45 you should get a lv 45 one as the reward.
---
I can't wait to take on the challenge of soloing it.
---
My character's build Just doesn't fit into teaming up.
---
Except for the fact it's been proven several times by people mining the data. Adrenal and bloodied nerfs were never mentioned until people found the changes to the related damage tables. You also can't tell me that food and consumables aren't degrading faster than they used to?
---
That being said, the repetive complaint posts are tedious, at best, and definitely negatively affect the "mood" in this sub.
---
Here's my tips: Diluted Rad-X and Radshield give rad resistance without suppressing mutations. Lead lining in your armor also gives you a rad protection. Diluted Radaway can remove little bits of rads at a time if you feel you need to get rid of a little bit.
---
Lastly: stealth. If you can avoid getting hit altogether, the rads wont be a problem. Unyeilding will give you plenty of agility which will make you more sneaky, so you don't have to be totally specced into it to work.
---
Agree that ammo factory is inefficient but going afk isnt advisable either lol  long term and actively parked there yes  so long as youre not an elite snob exploiting the system with gear that i considered to be broken and now this but its not fair to have people exploit an item in the system like that. He packed up quick once he realized i figured his game out. He couldnt afford the replacement cost of the generator anymore
---
There‚Äôs a bunch of datamined skins for armor coming out
---
That's earlier than the 24th or any later day. It still counts.
---
Again I missed it, really have to keep a better eye out on Sundays
---
Nice anything neat sounding? Or a link to source?
---
Its easy to save ammo when you dont use ammo
---
It's bug, that happened to me as well. Your camp is automatically in the same place in survival mode as it's in adventure, and I have had multiple times the bug where I die and for some reason my camp and every map marker except vault 76 is missing. Sometimes when I die in adventure, only train stations are available. And too many times in survival mode I have died to see that map has zero markers, can't spawn and I just have to quit and reconnect to server.
---
Great for hydration, and nothing else.
---
Level 5 vanguard's wood leg armour.
---
they have aimed it at 2 lvl 50s, so I'm hoping it will be difficult to solo from Lvl 75 -100 and then easier from 100+
---
Its easy to make you just click a few buttons sometimes
---
I disagree with your observations and think the world is worth exploring by foot with your eyes opened, but I fully agree with ideas such as "deadly adventure" mode where there are no low level enemies at all, and the enemies scale in level up to high hundreds. I'd prefer the enemies to go the deadly path not the spongy path. I.e. chameleon deathclaws being able to onehit you, not super mutant that needs 500lb of ammo to face before he dies.
---
Inert Flux is useless. It's basically spoiled meat or veggies - when you obtain raq flux, you have to take it to a chemistry station and turn it to stable flux before it spoils.
---
Wow, that is an amazing bug... you aren't supposed to be able to kill people during events lol
---
This is exactly the experience I had.
---
‚ÄòCareful, making ammo is bannable!
---
I support this and more wall variety in general
---
Hey I or does poo know you left the 100 acre wood?
---
use it as water with rad resistance, but you might want to check the weight and toss it.
---
can't remember the inert weight,but the raw flux is 'heavy'
---
Sounds like it might be time to try playing the game the way it's intended to be played and actually socialize a little bit! 
---
Trust me: It's worth trying out. As someone who went about 300 hours without making any in-game friends, it's like night and day and I'm kicking myself for not trying it sooner. Maybe make a post on /r/fo76FilthyCasuals saying "looking for group" for your platform and see if anyone feels like mobbing up with you.
---
I thought they patched that
---
Obviously he didn't fast travel into Survival mode. He didn't have pacifist on, tagged people during the fight and once the event ended they ganked him, at which point he likely experienced the same thing we all have where the options to respawn are incorrectly limited. This is when respawning on a friend/teammate in the social menu is preferred. 
---
How he got from simple and easily explained display issue to this wild story of changing game modes on fast travel is beyond me.
---
You missed out. While it wasn't on the same level as Far Harbor (and what is?), it was a hell of a lot of fun and introduced all kinds of great content to the game.
---
I was level 60 on an Alt and received a level 25 sword this past weekend. I've never seen one higher level so I think that's the max. I would love to be proven wrong...
---
Repair kits in the atomic shop-? I hope not.
---
Did you play Hunted: The Demon's Forge? It was clunky and awkward but a friend and I actually had a lot of fun co-oping it
---
You *know* they don't travel well, right?
---
I've dropped my main weapon (instigating sniper) a few times on accident, luckily either at camp or in the WS shops, where I have (so far) managed to gather it back up with a stoke of luck.
---
If Bethesda doesn't come up with (or borrow) a way to help keep this from happening, I hope that someone in the community can come up with a simple mod to help with this (if they haven't already, seems like I remember reading about something close to this a while back).
---
Did you run out of caps when you died?
---
 Maybe it's just a small patch, the dungeon should already be from the previous patch.  I have appeared in a gignate sewer and the server disconnected me, when I try to make a quick trip to the uranium event
---
Friendly neighborhood spider bear.
---
I with you my friend :) 
---
Honestly i don't really like farming, game gets boring if you farm, I don't want to get bored, love this game. I'm lvl 147 and main region I "explore" is 1/4 of the map south/east.
---
I posted similar [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bcbtv6/make_survival_lvl_50_only/), my suggestion was to make survival lvl 50+, but looks like no one liked it :)
---
Hey Eeyore does Pooh know you left 100 acre wood?
---
Yall act like ammo is hard to get use meleee and conserve your funds that‚Äôs why the ammo factory is sought after  in the wastelands and no tool in the hox should be able to stop anyone from breaking in and overraking their owners, nothing
---
I was over level 100 when I pulled a level 25 Meteoric Sword, ao that's definitely not it. I had hoped it was though...
---
Yeah its all very odd, since Bethesda Support Twitter page have been radio silent for a while. I expect that the New dungeon would be introduced in a normal scheduled update, since previous Bethesda replies have stated that this update will also bring patches to bugs such as being unable to mod items. I guess and assume that the update will come around at the normal time of 10am EDT/3pm UK time. But honestly who knows. But it's safe to guess it'll come today, was confirmed in a Bethesda replies comment stating that it'll come later today.
---
Agreed on both counts. Lots of dumb meatheads who can't or won't read, but hopefully if this sort of dynamic content becomes the norm, players will learn to fight smarter and not harder. This is absolutely a positive direction for the game to take, and I hope that when we get raids later on, we'll see similarly-interesting raid bosses.
---
LOL, too funny.
---
Yea, cause I really want to solo it.
---
I was thinking the same time. I don't remember there being any downtime the day the Fachnact Parade was added. I hope and expect this will be the same.
---
I have what I call a bloody jack of all trades build. No maxed stats. High strength, endurance and intelligence. My bloody build makes up for my lack of damage perks and I can actually enjoy the grind thanks to QOL perks. I don't put out the damage of someone locked into a single weapon but I go several days in between repairs and can still one shot a top level ghoul or super mutant when I'm all bloodied up... In terms of PVE I'm quite competitive. 
---
Queen fights have been a challenge for me. It's taken a long time and a lot of tweaking. I wind up swapping most QOL perks out for damage boosting perks. I've gone from being mildly helpful at scorched earth events to being one of the major damage dealers. 
---
Best part about my build is the adaptability. If the queen fight needs melee guys. I'm melee. Needs heavy guns? I'm heavy. Needs support? I'm a medic. I can show up to a scorched earth event, evaluate the needs of the group and insert myself in what ever position needs the most help.
---
Works on PS4, hold o for the light to pop on. Its usually always off tho.
---
do you mean you pip-boy?
---
i know on xbox is B you need to press and hold it, and the light will come on.
---
Yall getting off topic and shit
---
It's expired Flux basically. You didnt create a stable version in time. It can be consumed and it's basically purified water with a little bit of rads.
---
Lol you speak as if I didnt try this already dumbass that‚Äôs why its an issue
---
It was like a week ago.  Also if you look at the burrows picture in the Bethesda article you will see some new style of armor(probably a skin)

---
3 out of 4 is pretty good
---
On PC:
---
Something is definitely up with legendaries, glad it is not just me.
---
Maybe they cut the legendary spawns because they thought we were getting them too fast, so rare legendaries were becoming less so. Could be tied into player vending coming soon, as with less spawns means that there will be more of a need for players selling their rare items. 
---
I can also confirm there has been nothing in Watoga... At first I though that might have had something to do with all of the vendors moving to White Springs, so less people fast travel there so there are less spawns. 
---
Also, for the past few days, or roughly about 15-20 hours of game play, I haven't seen AWOL spawn once. I have my CAMP just outside the area so I always notice it when it does. Typically I would be able to farm it twice a game session.
---
I've only seen Uranium Fever spawn once within the same time frame, and only one supervisor dropped a legendary (1\* Suppressor's Gauss). This is another event I'm always watching for and run it as many times as I can.
---
Creekside Sundew Grove hasn't spawned anything either, now that I think of it. That place is usually good for one or two legendaries. 
---
I haven't checked out West Tek for the past few days though. 
---
However, Saturday night I was farming over in White Springs (with an incredibly loud and funny drunk guy on open mic singing while crippling ghouls and then naming them... RIP Earl) and just about every ghoul had a legendary drop. Still mostly 1\* garbage, but I have never farmed so many at one time though. 
---
side note: I don't server hop too often. Once I run out of friends on different servers it starts to become a waste of time getting on a fresh one I haven't been on yet. During a game session I will server hop between three people, three times at each location I am farming at, and only when it appears someone was there before me.
---
 I advance a lot, there are only balance problems in pvp, and a very bad mission system  all missions consist of finding a holodisck, following instructions of someone dead, finding another holodisck to find someone dead,

Nipple Salad!

I feel like I see no other Free State  faction members

This reply needs to be pinned
---
are you having a stroke? Do we need to send help?
---
Lol. I see people waste money on such stupid stuff but for some reason THIS video game people just care what other people think so much. 
---
I pre-ordered it and loved it. I played through all the "issues" and it was still a great game. Everyone is too sensitive. It's a video game. Either play it or don't. Stop asking strangers on the internet what they think.
---
Sure, they ran off and formed the BoS that we saw in FO4. Racist, xenophobic, and murderous.
---
Whitesprings can be done easily in a radiation suit, Barbarian, Evasive, Serendipity, Scaly Skin, Grounded all give you enough tankiness to deal with the ghouls and you might want Fireproof for exploding cars.  Or just use PA on your bloodied - for Whitesprings and Scorched Earth.
---
IIRC the legendary vendor isn't coming out until the end of May, so you might want to either sell some of those, or make a mule character to hold onto them.
---
Elephants?
---
dunno, its usually after the downtime. 
---
Has there been a downtime?
---
Item for item trading is needed just for the logical sense of it. It's not even about the scamming. I have personally never been scammed.
---
Side note, Sela\_wot is an excellent seller to buy from. Also batman1876. Deals with them always go smoothly.
---
Does eating people make you wanted? Otherwise, the encrypted event might be the new buffet line.
---
I could see that. I continue to await a response to be sure. I guess they'll get around to it when they get around to it. Still, every day that passes sort of diminishes the value of the community's opinions.
---
Yeah definitely not, but it's a good way to see how things could be done in game. Tbh I'd like to see a way of organising them in-game like guilds in mmo's but I don't see it happening soon.
---
Since it was only the legendaries that exploded and they stopped legendary robots from spawning, yes, yes they did stop it, lol.
---
Whether it was in purpose and they didn't tell us or whether it's just a big is the debate.
---
People are full of bs if they say they are spawning regularly for them.
---
This, other than removing dehydration it *currently* has no other use.
---
\* I'm not saying that it will get a use in the future.
---
Awesome drop! Worth at least 20k. For real.
---
Did you even read my original post? Did you understand what is actually about?
---
plenty of people are selling it on the market. Shouldn't be a problem to buy one off of someone if he won't make it in time
---
I'm wondering this too.  I have looked everywhere for info. Now that they only give us 5 min warning I kind of want to know earlier than that.
---
# Just RUN
---
If you're on console, the bumpers  (L1 and R1) scroll much faster than the dpad.
---
no argument from this corner.
---
I've been overencumbered since ohhh...the first week I started playing, so I walk everywhere.
---
Fast travel may be convenient, but the joys of discovery via walking cannot be underestimated!
---
Ahhhh hahahaha
---
Don‚Äôt worry this scene is supposed to be awkward
---
My brother and I have been playing on new survival characters using NO HUD at all.  It's actually amazing.  All of our quests are a lot harder without markers, we actually have to pay attention and explore.  It's been hard as hell but that's a welcome change to the typical fallout 76 experience... not knowing how much hp I have, or an enemy has, or even what level they are, gives a great sense of terror and survival instinct, I highly recommend it
---
This is why I won't play survival. That sounds like free-for-all death match , not survival.
---
 That's just pointlessly stupid to me to turn and attack people you just completed an event with.
---
To each their own I guess.
---
That's very good to know, I Like having fun with it so far, pretending like I am Elmer Fudd hunting waskewy wobots, huhuhuhuhuh. It has been a blast using it so far.
---
Well the limited time items in the store have 2 hours left. Maybe that's when it's coming down
---
Support is frustrating and hit or miss but it's also about the same kind of technical support I've come to expect from every company, even ones I've worked at. Depressing but true. You're frequently going to get shitty canned responses, especially on the first ticket. The more information you provide to prove your issue that easier you can escalate it.
---
As for your problem, my understanding is that it doesn't matter how many water purifiers you have, it will only produce water at a static rate. Additional purifiers only increase the max amount of water you'll produce. If you're in build mode and hover over the purifiers and they all have the yellow "lightning bolt" symbol and not red that will confirm they're powered, in case the animation is running but they don't have enough power flowing. I would expect if you just locked and left them for an hour or two you'd have water in multiple purifiers. If it's not working that way it's bugged for sure.  I would recommend taking a short video (I believe it's easy on xbox/ps4) showing they're all powered and hooked up.
---
I also seem to recall I had issues powering them at some point that I resolved by hooking each one directly to a generator (instead of multiple generators hooked together and then wired to a purifier).
---
Which platform? I've had people try to scam me out of a 2 shot explosive combat shotgun. The drops are so low for good weapons (Ive beaten the sheepsquash event 15 times and have nothing but white fedoras and thats not fun anymore) I have gone to some facebook trading pages and the scamming is rampant in them.
---
Melee? Not sure, maybe collect marine armor for the rad resist; you don‚Äôt lose much standard DR and ghouls don‚Äôt hit too hard anyway. 
---
Ranged? Kill them before they reach you of course! That‚Äôs the whole point of a bloody build, security through overwhelming firepower ;)
---
Lol i know they were ridiculous in creating a sub like that but i could see why they wouldn't want you to gain info on where to find exploits since you would engage in it yourself. Which in a way makes the game worse since thr are cheaters about. 
---
However, tbh i dont think it matters since fo76's pvp is still lacking and thr are no other competitive aspects of the game. 
---
Fo76 is generally seen as bad so the probability of grps of players with 'extreme' views are more likely than other gaming communities so im not surprised now that i think about fo76fc behaving as such. 
---
It sucks that they clearly went against their rules, and shld at least amend it and simply admit that their rules were not up to task on clarity and remove your post w/o banning you. 
---
Maybe you can communicate with another mod on thr if you change your mind on participating on that sub. Anyways have fun with the game and thanks for the explanation! =)
---
I got a message on Sunday when mine was getting hit But it shows and disappears quickly with the only way to confirm it is by opening the map.

I just hope its not more firecracker whiskey......
---
Fair point, but it would be nice for them to be up front and state it.
---
True. I got it on the off chance we'll be able to mount it on the wall some day. Unless I get tired of it taking up 15 lbs of stash space first.
---
I think making whitesprings this big "hub" was a bad idea, now there is no need to even explore the map, just go to whitesprings!
---
It could have been a SB, don't think you get a warning then ?
---
But i have got my fusion generator and decon. shower destroyed by players with out seeing a warning, but i could have just missed it ?
---
I always store the generator and shower when leaving cam now :/
---
15 lbs is 6.81 kg
---
I don't think it would take much. I honestly feel like the framework for a lot of this stuff is already in the game unused, and that's half of why it's so glitchy. They've been adding assets but not "activating" them yet, so I think the game is trying to read those sometimes and can't.
---
I've been playing since open beta and the game has improved a great deal... they're always adding new content and always making changes. They've probably been the most active and responsive to the community out of any game I've played. They're earnestly interested in improving and adding to the game and take suggestions and feedback seriously.
---
In summary, it's come pretty far and shows no signs of not continuing to go farther.
---
My general rule is levels matter more for guns and less for melee. That being said, some guns are just as good at level 40 as level 50. It all depends on the gun and its effects and your build.
---
Yeah people are stupid
---
It's already in the game: [http://prntscr.com/ncph5d](http://prntscr.com/ncph5d)
---
There's almost 400 spawn references for loot, enemies, and container, so it looks like it's all there.
---
Its obvious that Bethesda is doing stealth nerfs. If you even try to tell such things in here Reddit you get down voted by fanatic Bethesda lovers.
---
Does it? I got mine the second time I ran the event and I see tons of people wearing it
---
Legendary, in every sense of the word.
---
I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm scrapping 30-50 pieces to learn a single mod on some of the armors (marine armor specifically).
---
...I always find bone shards instead.
---
The best raiders are DED raiders. üòé
---
I'd like to see more legendaries in Watoga, but also that the existing robots deal a little more damage and be more aware. It is incredibly easy to run up behind or even straight at them (in power armor even) and gank them before they even notice you.
---
How about the new vendor that can trade legendary's, was / is that delayed also ? dont remember when it was planed :/
---
When my CAMP was near a high traffic area with a nearby monster spawn, I noticed I only got the message if the attacker was a player.  I would come back to my camp and random scorched, ghouls, or mole rats would have wiped out good portions of it.
---
I'm not 100% sure that you get the message if the attacker is just an in game enemy.
---
Thanks for your work showing this. Well done.
---
Thought it was just me for a few days then last night I found one of those sweet spot servers. Wes Tec, Harper's Ferry, WS spawning legendaries like crazy. Made multiple runs around Watoga and not a single one spawned. Haven't seen one there since the last patch.
---
I personally don't think it was a deliberate Nerf but that's just a gut feeling with Zero to back it up.
---
Yea I had to rebuy daisycutter all rise cause I threw them away when the stash was only 400 lol.
---
But I might keep this one since I dont have any other sniper weapon
---
I have this issue... do I have a chance when I only have 1 endurance so can't equip any rad res perks? I chose offence over defence when I chose my spec ha
---
That's actually another one of my pictures [https://imgur.com/a/9QhCQe0](https://imgur.com/a/9QhCQe0)
---
You're not wrong, but this particular phenomenon powers up the Armchair Psychologist in me.  There are so many topics like this posted every day.  I wonder about the thinking behind them.
---
Me, I can be pretty impatient.  It's a flaw, but whatever.  When I want to know something, I search for what I'm looking for.  I find it, read it, and then I know.  I have the information faster.  It's way more efficient to spend 30 seconds searching than it is to ask people and wait for the replies to trickle in one by one.
---
Day after day, many people skip that and instead they make a new thread asking for opinions which are already there.  They came all the way to r/fo76.  It's just one step farther to do a search.  Why don't they?  What is stopping them from doing so?
---
Is it something in their mentality which causes them to seek help from others rather than be self-reliant?  Self-reliance in this particular topic would ultimately mean firing up the game yourself (assuming you already own it) and giving it a whirl.  They choose to ask other people for their opinion instead of doing that, though.  Maybe the same trait that prevents them from playing and forming their own opinion also prevents them from searching the threads already here. 
---
Or maybe they want interaction.  Reading a thread is passive.  Posting and replying is active.  People are paying attention to you specifically, and maybe that's the real motivator here.
---
I don't know.  I think it's an interesting thing and I'm curious about the traits that make someone do that.  Sadly, my Armchair Degree is not worth much.
---
My quad explosive less AP with flechettes is an absolute beast and I have zero spec into heavy guns.  It rips shit up AND has infinite ammo due to the flechettes bug.  Worth it.
---
And I mean blast zones not rads in general. I can deal with that with diluted rad away.
---
My worry is that they are nerfing legendary spawns and will later introduce ATOM purchased tokens to trade into Legendary vendor.
---
I agree and disagree. I don't like to see misinformation but things also can't be discussed or investigated unless people post about them. That said I hate seeing the same theories crop up again and again. Some are even disproven time and time again but that information quickly dies in a busy sub-reddit. It's the age of fake news after all. Obama probably did some of these things.
---
The pain of removing üò´
---
You used to be able to sell it for an okay price to vendors, but they nerfed the price for them a while back
---
Maybe they'll sort out the low level mobs with the new nuclear winter mode?
---
Just guessing, no source
---
Meh, I only play like once or twice a week and them I'm mostly just grabbing stuff to make 5.56 ammo or checking out some of the new content.
---
I also don't get legendaries a lot, so I feel I might regret it if I sell a bunch of them. Also, how does a mule character work? I only have one ps4...
---
Is this post about playing solo or just whining about legendary drops?
---
Same, I used to only had radicool because I was running bloodied melee, now I‚Äôm doing non auto rifles
---
Yea radicool is the only end perk I have, with me keeping my health low with rads. I instantly die as soon as I enter a blast zone though ha
---
As Phoenix says: "Watoga is no ~~man's~~ robot's land. Literary!"
---
Having two camps on two different characters right next to theWatoga train station I can confirm - ZERO legendaries since the patch. Ocassionaly a legend shows up in the stream North of the town, but no legendary robots.
---
My guess is that they nerfed all legendaries a month or so before the arrival of the Legendary Vendor. So ppl don't and have an "objective" in a game (to grind legendaries) so the new content "stays" longer with the playerbase
---
Atom shop Repair Kits a -&gt; make daily tasks more difficult 
---
Legendary Vendor -&gt; make legendaries less likely
---
:/
---
I have a couple I'm not using, if you're looking to buy or trade on PC.  I have a 1* anti armor, a 3* bloodied +1 perception +10% while aiming, I have a 3* instigating with +50% vats critical and +dr while reloading, and a level 35 executioners with +10% while aiming and vats critical fill.  
---
I like gauss rifles... I'd be looking to trade for a nice handmade or lever if you're into any of these
---
The Burrows is already in the game, the exits are just disabled, we might not even see downtime.
---
Thanks üëçüèª
---
my god its like bethesda keeps shooting themselves in the foot
---
so WHY dont they want us to farm legendaries anymore? its like one of the only things to do once you get high enough level...
---
So they nerfed white knight perk to introduce repair kits... 
---
nerfed/boosted food drink decay rate to introduce fridges/backpacks...
---
And now nerfing legendary farming... why?
---
Probably a bunch of lying lowes whose paychecks are tied to the sale of the game.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/new/
---
There are very few guns for level 5, Shotgun and Pipe rifles mainly. getting an explosive on one of those would make me rage so hard.
---
I‚Äôve been checking their twitter and site and I didn‚Äôt see anything yet. The atomic shop items from last week expire in 2 hours so probably around then?
---
I would like to see more random mobs lead by a legendary in the game world, it would definitely motivate you to randomly explore more than to just farm known hot spots.
---
I think this has happened before and its just a bug, though the real sheepsquaches probably while be able to attack workshops in the future
---
What are you five?
---
Thanks for the confirmation!
---
Maaaaaaaannn... I think scrapping one-piece-for-one-mod on the leather armour has really spoiled me! Thanks for the depressing but useful information! :)
---
There's an old saying related to this. One who lives in a glass house should not throw stones.
---
I do agree though we do need more wall variance for our camps.
---
Yep. They just have to flip the switch.
---
&gt; 9am america time
---
I‚Äôd say that the word ‚Äúnerf‚Äù pretty much presupposes intent.
---
trust me I have tested with just one piece and mobs at white spring will own you.  I have 5 pieces on and I walk up and one shot everything and never get detected most times they run right by me even in danger there chance to hit me is very low.  This is melee if your sniper you could prob get away with one piece.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs my guess.
---
id keep waiting for a few months tbh. 
---
they nerfed a lot of things and the game feels more grindy than it used to. theres mabye 8-12 hours of new content to do, but imo id just go do it later when the game feels like less of a grind/there are actual rewards for said grind.
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs very counter intuitive, repetitive and ridiculous to go over so many people and delete them. Bethesda definitely could‚Äôve done more to help us
---
I got that notification too but when I checked my pip boy it just said Liberators. Its definitely a bug
---
Ah kk here‚Äôs hoping for Chinese stuff!
---
You're absolutely right however the way I see it Todd Howard in spite of what some may think, cannot just create the game he wants to create. He has to answer to zenimax and the corporate bosses. Just like all the rest of us he has someone who writes his paycheck who tells him how to do things. 
---
If it requires me paying for a few microtransactions here and there on Elder Scrolls blades in order for him to be able to launch Starfield, Elder Scrolls 6 and other amazing single-player experiences I will do it. 
---
In other words, I'm sure he gets tremendous pressure to produce loot box filled microtransaction cash grabs. The fact that we even have any single player games is incredible to me in this day in age. 
---
There's been a huge push back since EA screwed up with Star Wars Battlefront Etc, and the trend of the industry's definitely for freemium, and loot box games. Let's give Todd and the developers it Bethesda the opportunity to produce games that we can love!
---
That's how I see Fallout 76 it was bethesda's way of placating the Masters at zenimax who are definitely pushing them to create multiplayer always online loot box type games.
---
Ahh thanks that would make sense.
---
You don't have to rebuild just move the camp. it will only cost you a few caps.
---
Oh yes, that nocturnal boxing glove I got was a real joy to find.  
---
If they're going to make legendaries rare they should make them worth the effort.  
---
Farming isn't cheating. It's like playing the lottery. Once in a while you get a good one, but most of the time you're just trading bullets for crap.
---
I can only repair one weapon at a time also since the update. I currently carry 3 Grog axes and have had 5 at once . I got the first one back in December. First time I repaired it, it disappeared and I thought I had lost it, but it was still in inventory and I thought it strange, because my shotgun and other weapons stayed in the repair screen and could be repaired past 100%.  The other axes also disappear after repair and always have.  I don't know if it is something in the code for the Grogs that they just can't modify or what, because you STILL cannot repair them above 100% and that has been a complaint for over 4 months now.

I revived a non-team mate in Grafton in survival. Of course I‚Äôm doing it all wrong and should have capabilities him :)
---
I wonder why I could and you couldn‚Äôt? He did do the ‚Äúcall for help‚Äù emote first.
---
Because bethesda is lazy and didnt give two sh*ts while asset ripping 76 into existence.
---
Why are there no children?
---
Why doesnt the game ever work properly?
---
Why do they keep taking one step forward two steps backwards?
---
Why do they insist on using the creation engine when they know its met its life expectancy a decade ago?
---
Why havent they fixed bugs in other games that the community was able to fix themselves long ago?
---
One answer total utter laziness and greed. My one time favorite dev has adopted EA mentality and it saddens me.
---
Make some offers.
---
For large values of ‚Äúearly May‚Äù.
---
BHAAAAA
---
Exactly. If they are up front with what they do people won‚Äôt complain. Just like three star bosses dropping drills and syringers. People hate being lied to. Just go ahead and make three star creatures super rare, that‚Äôs totally ok, but when it says three star don‚Äôt let it drop 1 or 0 star garbage.
---
Thank you! I feel so stupid!
---
good idea, but im in the forest so no scorchbeasts there!
---
Considering decorations are probably tied to inventory like player vending will be.  Probably a safe bet they launch close together or on the same update.
---
My bad.
---
it has been replaced with &lt;PROTECT AND SERVER&gt;
---
I think factions would really change the game for the better!
---
There was a really good thread on factions last week in the sub. If you search for factions it should pop up.
---
oh ok, thank you, so at least there IS still a message, i dont know HOW i could have missed it...
---
Yea it will hurt. It all depends on what route of gear you go with and what role you‚Äôre playing. The only game changer that I can think of is going a bloody build support class. The armor would be able to offset some of the loss. If you‚Äôre talking cards in general though, your options aren‚Äôt that great when it comes to mixing damage and survivability. I know my specific build, I only have room to move one point before crippling my build. It‚Äôs not a googled build. But I can say that I survive better than most that I‚Äôve seen with a similar build and I still end up being nearly guaranteed that I‚Äôll be the top damage dealer as well.
---
Spot on with this assessment. I am just as curious as to the motivation behind these posts. 
---
I would hazard a guess the person asking these questions on Reddit are also the ones that don‚Äôt read the Quest directions, that are on screen and right in ones FACE, and then complain about the difficulty/confusion overall in this game. 
---
I think the issue is bigger and encompasses a massive lack of reading comprehension in the world today. It‚Äôs like living in the land of the blind.
---
Im in the forest, I cant see how some low level scorched or molerats totally demolished my entire CAMP the whole thing was leveled to the ground, i have heavy machine gun turrets that up till now have always taken care of the problems
---
Yeah, loads of dicks at events this past week...
---
The only reason I go to Watoga anymore is for the high school (plastic and aluminum).  Half the time there aren‚Äôt even any enemies present so why bother battling it out with robots on the streets of Watoga?
---
i tried that but it wont let me, no matter where i try to place it it wont let me
---
Gj bro your UI (User Intelligence) is excellent üëçüèª
---
It's flashes a tad bit quicker then " you've contracted a disease" but is the same color and font so it's easily overlooked.
---
I disagree with you.  Just making my ‚Äúvote‚Äù heard.
---
Only while they are still Raw (2 Caps each last night) - Inert, they won't take them.
---
Yeah, but they nerfed White Knight. /s
---
one piece = mob deaths
---
2 piece = less mob deaths
---
3 piece = 1 to 2 hits taken per run
---
4 piece = walk up to mobs kill at will laugh as they pass by you
---
5 piece = sit on top of a building pot shooting scorch beast while they never see you 
---
so yeah there is a bit of a difference
---
See thing happened to me last night. I was away from my base majority of the night and when I went to dump off junk and stuff the main floor was completely destroyed. When i arrived one single wolf was still there gnawing around it so I assumed it was that, but dang it would have taken a long time for one wolf to do this....or maybe metal walls are just that weak??  I went to my C.A.M.P. box and "repaired all structures" and it was fairly cheap to do. I mean for like 10 metal walls, all my work benches ect....it was under 10 scrap for like 5 different types... So I'm not sure how you don't have the materials to repair it because you don't have to rebuild each one individually, but I'd be happy to donate some resources to you to help you rebuild.
---
I think they just need a gift emote. That would probably be the easiest.
---
I'm more disgusted by the jackels that show up to steal loot bags. So disgusting
---
Cool! Hard to find active trading clubs in XB
---
Good to know :)
---
Just to have fun, I might try adapting my build, or making another character, to utilize this weapon.
---
This is a broken as fuck game.  Hopping is the only way to get things you need, so its what we do.
---
So take all that and apply it to a well developed and working game, which fo76 certainly isn't, but that mindset has no place in something as foundementaly broken a this game is.
---
we need like a BIG font and an alarms sound to let us know!
---
idk man, I'm not the one throwing a fit over a bunch of pixels in a game that resemble traps in a videogame.
---
&gt; I would hazard a guess the person asking these questions on Reddit are also the ones that don‚Äôt read the Quest directions, that are on screen and right in ones FACE, and then complain about the difficulty/confusion overall in this game
---
Yes, that occurred to me too!  I did notice that part of the backlash of this game was from the "We need NPCs" crowd saying that there was "no story."  The story was all around them, in holotapes and notes and arranged scenes.  So many people seemed to miss all of that.  Like they need an actual human-looking thing with a voice to hold their hand through the game, or else they miss what's there.
---
It's made me wonder how many people who "beat" the other Fallout games missed 75% of the content.
---
Right? I can‚Äôt wait to get tons of space back once the vendor comes.
---
There is no level cap, so eventually, yes, you can max every card. My main is... 200something now, has all the cards I want, and a ton of random utility cards. I think I‚Äôve got 6-9 extra points right now. 
---
I‚Äôve got card swaps from my primary HW/explosives/PA build to 2h melee, 1h melee. I haven‚Äôt bothered putting together much else but I do have some random rifle and pistol cards.
---
yea ik not criticism just something
---
Do you mind if I take up your kind offer to upgrade combat armor to BOS? If you don't mind I'd like to message you in a few days to have 3 pieces upgraded to bos, and if you can then upgrade 5 pieces to deep pocketed that would be amazing.
---
The delay is because I'm trying to get the final legendary piece I want, but I'm out of caps so need a few days to find some one selling the piece I want.
---
I love them. If you're running bloodied and unyielding, you're likely running a glass cannon build. 
---
And the perk radicool, literally makes it absolutely beautiful. Plus..bloodied is more damage the lower your health so we're usually half rads. It's the glass cannon way of life. Tack on radicool to give those rads purpose. More rads. More strength. Combine with bloody. Now my sledge does 600 damage each swing
---
Hm lvl 91 legendary deathclaw  i was 50-60... 2h melee and he's death after 4-5 hard hits self supermutants are harder in my opinion but what I know just ~2 weeks I got this game.
---
Level 50 \*\*\* Ghoul Slayer Power Fist 
---
\*40 less damage while power attacking
---
\*40% more power attack damage
---
\*+30% more damage to ghouls
---
no problem, looking back I was just salty about losing gear to the feed the people quest. I told bethesda about it and they responded with "don't let the game destroy your gear and only put in the ingredients." So I told them that all I got out of that response is that if it is in the game it is fair game, and was looking to get better gear back than what I lost. It really was just me throwing a fit about losing some of my hard earned gear to a glitch and being told in a very south park BP way "we're sorry.... *sooorrrrrrryyyyy*"
---
I will never go back to that sub personally due to how they treated me. I am more mad that the mod didn't just flat out say "even though this doesn't break any rules, this isn't a post we would like on our sub." I would have respected that more than just trying to lie and weasel your way to "it breaks the rules." It was the whole "it's you that's the problem not us" attitude that festers there. It was just poor handling on their part, one whiny redditor, and one power tripping mod, but that's enough of a red flag for me. That mixed with my buddies experience is just enough to stay away.
---
Inert is .02 and Water .25 thats with Thru-Hiker 3 (Not sure if it works on Inert Flux)
---
I am laughing at you.
---
That would be pretty cool, especially as we would all have to chase her across the map as we wouldnt be able to fast travel without knowing her destination.  Or you could finally have a use for the scorchbeast detection system and you tune into a radio station to try track were she is. Make it happen Bethesda
---
Ya ditto
---
Was going through the data on the area (it's already in the game)
---
&gt;!73 Ambush sites, like how in FO4 Ghouls would crawl through windows or from under machines.!&lt;
---
Gonna be good fun.
---
In your opinion, is the gamma gun good against robots, supermutants or scorched? A scorched fired one at me the other day, and it was very powerful.
---
So maybe some hopeful foreshadowing that the sheepsquatch quest line isn't done!
---
   
---
thanks for things that should have been since the launch ....
---
The closer your camp is to vault 76, the bigger a target it is.  Until pacifist extends to camps, I would recommend avoiding the area.
---
That's disappointing :(
---
I love rads! Makes me stronger with radicool
---
Whiterun? 
---
Yeah, BGS asset swapped a lot, but the day I see Whiterun on the map, I'm just uninstalling.
---
Ugh, the ‚Äòwhy should I return‚Äô posts are so annoying. I‚Äôm not going to sit here and detail all the updates and reasons why you should play the game.
---
I don‚Äôt think they deserve thanks for doing what they were gonna do all along. People got hysterical when the game released in its poor state but did anyone actually think they were going to straight up abandon the project?
---
I don't save people at the sheepsquatch event. I only have a few stimpaks, and being a conduit I use them up fast. I can't use them on others or I will run out and not be able to be a conduit. Just die, you respawn with full health anyway
---
Unless that person is in front of me and we've had some some sort of back and forth, whether it be through emotes or mic, I don't accept it. Especially if I'm on the leaderboard which is often with our group
---
im sorry that happened to you! i just had bulked up all my excess resources to sell, trying to reach that 1400 cap limit, and my CAMP was maxed out so its alot of materials...
---
thank you for the offer, it is appreciated, but i think i need a bit of a break, i do appreciate the tip a bout being able to "repair all" like in a  workshop, i did not know we could do that at our camps
---
No problem, you just need to remember to get to me with it. I got learned all BoS plans and all Deep Pocketed plans, so I can modify what you need. 
---
I'll usually take 100 caps per piece (my materials) for BoS mods and 
---
70 caps per piece (my materials) for deep pocketed. IGN Baronik
---
I'm on PC, but that's okay.  Not really my kind of weapon.  But thanks!
---
You can for $9.99 USD. :(
---
I think I see you commenting for ‚ÄúChinese stuff‚Äù a lot haha
---
I have seen legendary robots at Watoga maybe 10 times in four months.  Perhaps your experience is similarly bad RNG?
---
Enclave items would be better.
---
Well theirs a real sheepsqauch model in game and its pretty fucking cool looking so I'd bloody well hope its not done.
---
I assume yes, everything is in the game already they just need to activate it
---
I thought about it when I paid the game at 60 dollars, and in 1 week they were selling it at less than half
---
I couldn't agree more.
---
I used to walk the tracks for my vendor loop. It's obviously not necessary now. I sit walk the tracks because every time I do, I find like 5 legendary mobs
---
There needs to be random map-wide events that spawn higher level enemies. Like region-wide rad storms that spawn more glowing enemies and ghouls. If you've played Breath of the Wild, think of the Blood Moon. Gives the sense of randomness, danger, and dread. There should absolutely be times where low level players are terrified and have to find shelter and hide until it's over.
---
They appear to be a different model. The ones on the table have two yellow and one blue balloon and are tethered to a weight. The ones attached to the chair have one yellow and two blue balloons and don't have a weight attached. You can see the strings are looped together near the top corner of the chair and the model is basically stuck onto it.
---
&gt;  is it possible that this is a duped item, 
---
Almost certainly.
---
&gt; will i get banned for having it or ill it be removed from my inventory?
---
Almost certainly not.
---
My camp is really off the grid so I rarely see or hear anything but it has been attacked by scorchbeasts and I didn‚Äôt receive a notification.
---
Yeah, I've gotten to a point now where I can survive against the SBQ in Unarmed (more Rad Resist), but the worst thing that can happen is finding myself over-encumbered.
---
Mine was in the Forest, north of the overseers camp and west of the river. 
---
It was a high traffic area.  Lots of players run by and ignore enemies.  Mole rats would routinely destroy my turrets, missile, heavy machine gun, etc cause of their burrowing and constant moving.  Then ghouls would pound away at everything. 
---
They would target things like my generators and purifiers, going thru walls and anything else to get to them.
---
This plz
---
Ahhh dang!! I had bulked and sold everything earlier and was already filling back up again when I was hit so I had enough. But yes the repair all structures is key. Everytime I go back to my base I go do that just as maintenance to keep up on repairs and whatnot.  Well come back soon, the wasteland needs you...and places to go and relax üòÅ
---
Cool story bro since when am i throwing a fit? Sounds like you are tbh
---
omfg that is so funny dude! I don't even know how I would react to being eaten during an event like this. I would probably just laugh my ass off.
---
Love hearing this shit, glad you got to have that experience and the more to come man!
---
Fuck yeaaa man, I literialy changed my build to a heavy gunner just so I could mow my way through a horde of ghouls
---
If you have ghoulish on, then it can almost act as a makeshift instantaneous diluted stimpack.
---
I'm on PS4.
---
Sounds like youre throwing a fit over some pixels that resemble a lever action rifle
---
Actually, your example IS in the patch notes. It wasn‚Äôt on patch day but they quickly added it and apologized for the oversite.
---
I've always suggested that a simple confirmation screen for both sides to confirm the transaction would resolve almost all of the trading problems.
---
They copied enough of the code from FO4, I don't know why they dropped the vendor transaction from that.
---
I don't care that you broke your elbow.
---
Something like that has been proposed, have people leave items at the whitesprings front desk, for instance.
---
I‚Äôm cool with it. I don‚Äôt hop characters often but moving things between them is a pain in the ass right now
---
I'm pretty sure Berry mentats still light them up. I know PA targeting HUD won't which is stupid if it can highlight a stealthd Assaulttron.
---
I've had two experiences with this in Survival.
---
1. We teamed up and started PvPing together and recruited a couple more people. It was awesome.
---
2. They started to destroy my camp so I logged off.
---
I guess if you don't mind having to log off very quickly it's worth a try for scenario 1. PvP with random team mates can be fun and you are probably going to survive longer in a team. I've kind of given up on surivial mode now though, it's a bit one shotty if you are too casual about it.
---
Regarding 1 I would much prefer if they flipped it around, scaled the players to the mobs/zone. so that the Supermutants in the NW of the map are just as strong as the ones on the SE.
---
B...but he just works
---
As you are no doubt aware, someone with any heavy accent, even in your native language, can be difficult to understand...IMHO having the holos etc in plain, relatively unaccented (insert native language here) is not necessarily a bad thing.
---
Oof
---
Yeah.  That's why I went with a single foundation "floating" CAMP, so it's easy to replace.
---
Even if you can't, though, you can break up the blueprint and have all the pieces necessary to rebuild your CAMP.  No need to reconstruct workbenches and other somewhat "expensive" items.
---
Mission Impossible
---
I know. Lets say you want to FT to a friend that is on position #12 in your friend list. Lets say you press the enter for the fast travel action just after somebody that was on position #4 on your friend list logged out, moving the #12 to #11. As a result, you send the game a legit and approved command to fast travel to list entry #12 (previously #13), which kicked you out of server,  joined survival one, and fast traveled to that person position. Multiple bugs can occur through this scenario. The funniest I had is when I invited a friend to team across servers, he accepted and was moved to my server :D
---
That‚Äôs the market adjusting to the poor sales.
---
Nothing to do with Bethesda.
---
I don‚Äôt deny that the game deserved those poor sales.
---
Have you tried to mod them into ultralight to save some space?
---
W: Bigger dick, H: $2.50
---
Brotherhood items would be better
---
Not really a lot of effort at all its all relative friend, but i do agree its pointless for him in the long run because its not how the game was intended to be played I‚Äôm sure
---
it new since the pvp mode came, so people know whats the difference of the modes.
---
That's my biggest problem with the game, above all bugs, QOL Issuets, etc: figuring out what's unintended and what's an intended change in the game. 
---
Watoga is one of the reasons I log in anymore, one of the last few sources of that consistent RNG slots machine high. I've recently been doing West Tek with a lower level farming for mid level legendaries but hearing this about Watoga makes me want to see if it's intentional (and probably my last straw) or unintended. If intentional but just not mentioned? Ugh.
---
I wouldn't mind something like the little storage locker type thing that was in Borderlands 2. I can't remember what it was called.
---
Just some specific container that we could have in our camp that held like 100 or even 50 lbs of items for those times when we find something that would really be useful for another character with a different build :)
---
There was before the patch. 10-15 legendary items. I don't know if it was nerfed on purpose, but yesterday I was at harpers ferry and this happened for the second time. I was killing the enemies and halfway through, and new enemies spawn everywhere. And most of them were legendary. I believe there were about 4 3star,  and 10 no stars. It was insane. I had someone with me so we got double the loot and I bought the good stuff from them like Bloodied Deathclaw gauntlet and a 3 star instigating deathclaw gauntlet. They even picked up a ghoul slayers explosive combat shotgun max level. Like I said this happened twice now and it's so unexpected, the enemies spawn directly on you and behind you. Perfect ambush.
---
You can go and do this yourself.  I farmed Watoga quite a bit in the past and to 0 over 400 bots was enough for me to stop bothering.  Combined with everyone else's experiences it's fairly obvious. I'm not sure what more proof you need.  I'm not spending another 5 hours for 20 more trials because it's not gonna happen.
---
Couldn't it be resolved even easier than 5000 pieces of proof?
---
I just would like to see one single video showing proof of date and show a legendary robot spawn in Watoga, at least on PC. I can't say if it's affecting other systems.
---
pip boy light doesnt work if you wear power armor and no helmet
---
let's just hope they do not end up as suddenly as they did with fallout 4
---
True unpopular opinion. But I agree. As much as I don't like it, it didn't make a whole lot of sense. Or, maybe make it so it only spawns legendaries if someone in the city hasn't completed Mayor for a Day.
---
If that's the case, you could probably miss it while in a workbench or viewing inventories, right?  I don't always see the Sons of Dane notification.
---
Oof.....I am. I desperately need some new content. I hit a wall many others have a few weeks ago. I used to hit a level up a day just messing around. I think I was at 150 for days cause I didn't want the rinse/repeat daily wandering
---
I lost a 3* Pump I had bought with a couple thousand caps.  It did not feel good...
---
I misread "unequip starched genes" as "unzip starched...".
---
I thought j was going crazy. I was doing the usual 5 power armor run (the bottom right base and move through watoga for the power armors, gotta catch em all! And I don't server hop, I like to stay on one server and try the next day). Now that I saw this, I have yet to see ONE legendary robot in Watoga. It was pretty cool too and starting to be my favorite place as Whitesprings is always packed.
---
Hey. If I see a bag chock full of aluminum, I'm not passing it up. A man's gotta mod his weapons you know?
---
It's in there but it's not linked anywhere, it doesn't look finished either.
---
2-Handed Melee Hook weapon. 
---
It has a slot 0 mod but it's just called "Upgrade" and not linked to a mod. I do see meshes for glass, nails, sheepsquatch horn, shock, and toothed mods. With textures for the glass and "nailshorn". "sheepsquatch horn" stands out.
---
Weight 7,Value 45, AP Cost 40.
---
Base Damage 10. It Hhs its own level curve table hitting 50 damage at Lv. 50, so I assume it'll go to level 50.
---
On top of that I also see data for SheepSquarchClub, SheepSquarchShard, and SheepSquarchStaff. Are those in the game yet?
---
Previously you could bump into the small spawn tubes and generate robots. It was decently common to get one to three legendary robots (or more!) In one server hop if you went through most of Watoga doing that plus checking already spawned robots. Very reliable source of one to three star drops.
---
I don't think many in this thread realize this is the bigger issue. If they did do it on purpose then be up front about it.
---
Last week the update started at about 7:00 a.m. PST so I would assume same time this week.
---
Correct, I missed it once when I was laying the smack down on some Green skins.
---
It's something that is too easily missed if you're not looking for it.
---
Sentinel doesn't work crouched, you have to be standing and have no movement at all. Also, while you can't VATS a crouched/chameleon'd player, if you hit them once you can VATS them. Weightless/Sentinel would be more ideal if that's your play style. You can stand invisible (chameleon mutation) and shoot.
---
Stealthboys are the ultimate PVP weapon because you can't be VATS'd and berry mentats don't always work. Combined with Assassin/Sentinel or Assassin/Cavalier you can be incredibly dangerous. It's probably just a matter of time before they get nerfed so that when you attack they stop working.
---
I can say before patch I did fight level 38 protectrons that were legendary. I have not seen any recently. I used to get junk legendary items from them so bed I would just leave them in the ground because half the time they were like a legendary rolling pin worth 1 cap.
---
It's probably a balance consideration in preparation for the legendary vendor. If we can get easy legendary drops and just re-roll constantly, everyone's going to be OP very quickly with God-roll items. I don't like the change, but I understand it from a balance perspective. Just wish they would say something...
---
Upvoting! Unsure of my own compassion but yours is much better then mine
---
Nice try, Todd Howard.
---
For real, and you sound like such a bro. Too bad I'm on xbox... :(
---
Yesterday was my first day playing, and I was barely a level 3 when someone dropped me an All Star bat and a basic clothing set. I'll have to make sure I pay it forward!
---
I don't think water is 0.25 with Thru-Hiker 3, that would imply it it is 2.5 normally.
---
Yeah, mine were molerats.
---
I'm more angry about it being done without them saying anything.  Also kills that entire portion of the map.
---
If you start at that base in the bottom right where the queen spawns and then go to that next firebase thing below the train station, then roof of high school, the crashed vertibird by the medical building and the roof of the convention center I think (?) you can search 5 power armor frames for those that like to collect them all. Especially the T-60's at lvl 50.
---
Yeah and OP is such a bro. Too bad I'm on xbox
---
So, is liver better with or without onions?
---
I've never actually thought about streaming, honestly. Playing on PS4, I never tried to figure out how. I guess I could just hit that broadcast button in the Share Menu...
---
Counter suggestions: 
---
Search out the unmarked locations
---
Choose a place you know is good for scavenging and go there on foot, I've had bizarre things happen doing this
---
Continue holding out for the next locales to be added in, we may get a new area entirely in the coming months with how much to the east is inaccessible
---
Wow, nice work man!
---
They aren't I assume they'll be added when the real Sheepsquatch is put into the game. Today perhaps?
---
I Find it despicable. But you do you
---
NCR stuff would be better
---
Just cause literally no one agrees with you doesn't mean you get to get upset and stalk my profile. go outside, little man.
---
Actually 
---
How about nuking ANY fissure site to activate SBQ?
---
Lol seriously, the drop system is garbage and there are only so many legendaries on the map to farm.  Maybe if chances weren't like 1/100,000 for multi star gear useful to my character I'd understand considering it cheesy.
---
Add me, my friends and I would love to work with you.

GT = TEH RED ZMAN

# Leveling
---
**1-15**: Do your responder quests all the way up to the point where it sends you to Top of the World to unlock various workbenches and for easy early game exp. Use whatever weapons you get. Hunting rifle is fairly good - will one shot most enemies assuming you have one appropriate for you level. Melee is also a good option. Taking the Poseidon Power Plant and doing the "Powering Up" event there 3 times will give you all 3 power generator plans (including fusion) for free. Plus you can get some fusion cores stocked up, and it provides a free fast travel point. Lots of scorched and good loot inside as well.
---
NOTE: If you don't have a **raider set of power armor**, Go to **Cliffwatch** (look it up here[https://fo76map.com/](https://fo76map.com/) ). Server hop until you have a full set of level 15 raider power armor, killing the scorched there (good exp / scrap from weapons and easy to learn most of their weapon mods this way). If you plan to do this, put your camp down in the hils above their camp. I'd start this at level 10 if you have nothing. Swapping to Survival Mode might be a good option here - less PvE players looking for low level power armor sets there.
---
**15-25**: Do Rose's raider faction quest if you want. It's not required for the other faction quests, and in my opinion, it's a bit dull (although I like Rose's voice actress, the quests are somewhat boring IMO). Be sure to do the quest at **Camp McClintock** for your Soldier's Certificate (needed later). New Gad is a decent grind spot for this level range, or alternatively, just explore and gather / kill as you go in the Ash Heap. There's a lot to see, and a big part of the fun is exploring the map and finding all the excellent holotapes and learning the stories of those who didn't make it. Take at least Poseidon Power Plant and defend it as necessary (these quests are great for leveling)
---
**25-50**: Do the [Miner Miracles](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Miner_Miracles) quest and get your free Excavator power armor. Have someone craft you a Gatling Laser or two. Seriously - I'll do it if you're on PC or someone on the community for your console will if you ask. This community here is really nice. You're going to start going up against level 25-40 enemies that require quite a bit more DPS than what you're used to, so you will need sustained firepower with easily obtained ammo. That's where the Gatling Laser shines. Works particularly well against super mutants and mole miners, which are high health but lightly armored. Disover and take all 3 of the power plant workshops. Make sure you lock the fusion core generator or people will just take your cores. There's no penalty for this. You can craft Fusion Generators instead of doing the "Powering Up" event, which takes a long time, although the ones at Monogah and Thunder Mountain are worth your time, since the mobs there scale up to your level to some degree, and there are lots of them. If someone contests, you can try to fight, but in my experience this is very rare. Ask nicely if they wouldn't mind letting you have it, but if they insist on taking it, that's just how it goes sometimes.
---
Do the various events that come up, discover which ones give the best loot / exp. Distant Thunder is very worth it for the chance to get rare power armor plans. AWOL Armaments is a guaranteed 3 star legendary enemy. Save up caps. You'll want a few thousand by level 50 so you can buy a bloodied Gatling Gun and/or bloodied .50 Cal and the mutation serums you need. Most people will be happy to craft all of those for you for 200-300c per serum. Just make sure you have Starched Genes rank 2 on or you could lose them. Craft lots of .50 Cal ammo with the Super Duper / Ammosmith perk.
---
Explore the map. Enjoy the stories of all the dead people. Have fun, in a depressed, gloomy way (I say that in jest, but I really enjoy it)!
---
At 45 you can craft you end game set of Excavator Power Armor, though you may want to wait until you have all the crafting perks for it to make it cheaper. Higher int (up to 20 I think) when crafting = higher base durability on it.
---
**50+**: The end game. Do the Enclave quest to unlock the ability to nuke, as well as a free set of plans for X-01 power armor. This is great power armor, but the mods are very rare, and it's costly to craft. You can buy plans for power armor mods of every type but X-01, however, you get the plans for base pieces of X-01 for free (but you need to get materials to craft it). Also do the Brotherhood of Steel quests to unlock a free set of Ultracite power armor. You can get Ultracite mod plans from the Scorchbeast queen, which you'll be doing a lot of.
---
Nuke Whitesprings and farm ghouls to save up Glowing / Hardened mass and High Radiation Fluid. You'll get lots of Glowing Blood which is great for selling to vendors, as well as Ionized meat. Bloodied Gatling Gun is a good choice for this due to ammo efficiency and being able to one shot Glowing Bloated Ghouls. Nuclear Material sells well too.
---
Nuke Fissure Site Prime and farm SBQ for Prime Receiver plans until you get them all. Gather Violet Flux / ultracite and craft Stable Violet Flux (sells for 100c per, used for making most desirable ultracite ammo types).
---
Trade. Gather. Save up caps. Buy plans for the things you want to make. Finish picking up all the crafting / situation perks in the build. Make friends so you can reload Whitesprings and farm it over and over after nuking. When you learn .50 cal prime receiver, you can make .50 cal ultracite ammo. Farm steel from mutants at West-Tek. Mine lead at Lucky Hole mine. Smelt lead with acid farmed from Toxic Larry's meat (snallygasters) or that you've gathered. Make lots of ammo. Sell or use it. Learn all the plans. Offer more services. Run end game dungeons (they will definitely be out by the time you're at end game).
---
Reset your level for more powerful abilities (new system coming later this year) to become a "legendary" player. Farm legendary items and trade them into purveyor (coming next month) for tokens to use to reroll legendaries in that search for the ultimate GG weapon (a bloodied 25% fire rate .50 Cal).
---
Try other, inferior character builds and wind up turning them into mules because your main is so much stronger. (I jest, but this has happened to me).
---
bruh you're literally stalking my page commenting on old post of mine please close reddit and think about your life
---
You can have multiple characters associated with a known account. I have 2 on PC
---
Fantastic idea, allows for many new opportunities!
---
I got a lotta love for BGS...they‚Äôve released some very good games over the years that have kept me busy for countless  hours.  Putting that to one side they got my thanks when I paid ¬£50 on release day.  What I got in return was a game that we all know really shouldn‚Äôt have been released in the state it was.
---
As I‚Äôm still playing it, I guess this in itself constitutes as a thank you.
---
Sounds convenient but the servers would crash all day
---
After today's update.
---
That seems pricy
---
I've been pretty happy with the game since November, I know it's had a fuckton of problems but I've ran into less broken quests than for instance Skyrim... always happy to get free expansions without the need to buy the annual pass almost every AAA game has these days. I truly hate that, I wouldn't mind paying the 90$ up front but going through the PS store drives me insane for some arbitrary reason... but that's a whinge for a different time.
---
How about you show me a video of you killing a legendary in Watoga if it's totally just bad RNG
---
That is interesting. Were you in an event? Did the person have a weapon out when they went down? I know the guy I tried to help started doing the "call for help" emote while I was standing over him. I wonder if it was because he went down with his weapon out. Iirc, players show as neutral when their weapon is away, and I think player turrets are non-hostile if you don't have a weapon drawn. You become hostile when you have a weapon out. I tried putting my gun away, but he still showed as a red dot on my compass, rather than the neutral yellow.
---
True but some are like 50 caps
---
There isn't a barbeque til I say there's a barbeque!
---
Yeah... Explains why it seemed to be wearing out fast
---
Berry Mentants are flaky vs Stealthboys. In my experience they work about 1/3 of the time and I have no idea if that has something to do with regular Stealthboys vs Mark III.
---
fo4 got a year worth of support. Isn‚Äôt that the norm?
---
It really does spoil you! It seemed like when I was fighting the scortched I got all kinds of leather and was just learning plans hand over fist. Then everything else is like "well, maybe you'll learn something someday"
---
Oh, that's not bad!
---
Very unpopular but very true. They were handout legendaries. We all know that isn't supposed to happen. It was broken and now its fixed. How I vet downvoted for a common sense flaw in the game baffles me.
---
Yeah the ones that are not fully repaired are less..the others like 70 caps
---
This has been suggested so many times it is crazy.
---
‚ÄúTo the guy I ate during the encrypted event‚Äù wait what
---
Huh that's quite a response from bethesda. So essentially they said to ignore the design flaw and if you don't best of luck. Idk why im still surprised given the way they handled the canvas bag fiasco. 
---
And good to see another south park fan lol.
---
Who cares if it's repaired if I'm going to grind it up! I wish you would get like 1 ballistic fiber from breaking it down, that would make it actually almost worthwhile.
---
Because I think it would be so damn cool going around as a communist Chinese soldier, this raider stick is getting a little boring
---
I can sell you some enlargement pills, trade only
---
On Xbox, I'd hook you up.  Sorry man.
---
Well tge prine site should change fissures every week really
---
This is why I'm not subscribed to this sub. I can't stand the endless crying about what people want. I periodically check this sub but I mostly can't stand it. Fithy casuals 76 is were it's at.
---
Ahhh ballistic fiber ..I buy it off the market subs here
---
I believe any weapon that shoots multiples (shotguns, dragon, etc) only gain one additional pellet instead of doubling
---
Events in the Ash Heap for the Plasma Grenade Plan. Just got it 2 days ago off of Breach and Clear.
---
I have a PvE farming set of armor that gives +25, rad resist per piece, and lead lined mods give additional protection. I don't bother with radshield or rad-x. I do use PA for SBQ fights inside nuke zones, but I hate every minute of it.
---
Yeah.  One of the best ideas I've heard on this sub was to devise a cryptid that roams the map, killing other enemies as it goes and accumulating strength and loot.  Then, a player who finds it has the option of engaging it in a difficult battle for all the loot and some Legendaries.  Sort of like an evil version of Grahm.
---
Anti-armor is a primary effect. You can't get both instigating and anti-armor
---
I remember reviving a guy with a stimpack after knocking him out
---
The borderlands model is the way to go.
---
yeah this has happened to me, it freezes you right in your inventory screen,  usually before it was just server disconnects, CTDs and infinite loading screens
---
now we have a 4th way to break the game, in-game total freeze ups in inventory
---
Probably AA. Two shot is especially good with explosive because both the bullets get full explosive damage.
---
Maybe, but probably not. There's a template for it but it doesn't look finished. It's missing things like DR/ER overrides and such. Unless they patch more data for it I don't think we'll see it.
---
There's always that chance though, so who knows.
---
Two-shot for "damage" but AA for pvp and a lot of pve if you use the other rifle perks for armor penetration.
---
Quite a literal blast I would assume. I'm using a level 35 TSE without any damage perks, which does only 300 damage a hit and it can still one shot those robots. I can only imagine what a fully perked out instigating explosive would do to them
---
And all those creatures in the nuked zone are now basking the the  Glow! You are one true believer of the Holy Atom! Rejoice!
---
They seem to work better with higher perception. You still can't spot them at rifle range though.
---
It‚Äôs not a bug, it shows up and disappear very quickly. They need to make that and workshops information display longer.
---
They should stop working the moment you attack. They should also stop working if you die... I know this to be the case because I used a mark III and was killed by a tesla rifle and when I came back I was still invisible.
---
I did! I wouldn‚Äôt put it past me to miss that tho. I found them under floor decor thanks for responding :)
---
Your shotgun is a glitch. And no joke, that it's glitched in vats too. Bethesda must change explosive to fire, or delete it. Tired of power armor tryhards with explosive shotguns. Not even fun to play on that build.

Things like this should be hotfixed in my opinion.
---
I wish there was a vendor that sold lever action guns..I would buy scrap repeat
---
I'll go along with that and also the comments aleady posted.
---
bethesda has always had my commissirations that after launch, people 'broke' it, and all this mess fell out.
---
but, the've fixed a good chunk of it and its moving forward and still has the potential to be a truly excellent game.
---
If anybody thinks you can produce a game with this many variables and add in the human factor and get it even half way right first time,your living in cloud cookoo land.
---
the boxes are coming out the printers,the disks are ready to ship, and wtf just happened there. to late but we can fix it on the fly.
---
"This games shite" is no good to man nor beast, if I do this and that,then this happens,
---
then it can get fixed.
---
bethesda....................soldier on.
---
Which "america time"?
---
There are a few.
---
You can already eat dogs in this game.
---
/i'm so, so sorry for saying that
---
I'm on Xbox and also had a feeling they had nerfed the legendary spawn rate for Watoga. Didn't see it in any patch notes. I haven't seen a single legendary there since the newest patch.
---
Shared bank would save me an ton of time transferring items.
---
I saw the plans the other day, but yeah, never the guns.
---
That is true. The pump is more of a cosmetic than something you can actually use when in need of water
---
Thanks for all the info!
---
I was just chilling at my camp last night and two asshole griefers just started throwing grenades at my house. Moved the house, took almost an hour to rebuild way at the north extreme and as soon as I get finished they showed up to do it again. Had to jump servers. Typically only find cool people in the game but when you find dicks they are extra dickish.
---
I'm at 22 perception on my alt and I had a team of 4 right in front of me and the only people berried we're my teammates. A new person fast travelled in, ate a stealthboy and was purple. It made zero sense.
---
It's the equivalent of mashing the elevator button.
---
Can you not get TS and instigating on the same gun? If not, which one is better to have??? I guess it all depends, but I would think on The Dragon specifically, instigating would be best.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Not criticizing :) and it‚Äôs hard to be a raider when there is nothing to raid in the game lulz
---
Would totally build a glass tower
---
Dont flatter yourself i was scrollin g the thread and came across this because lol guess what i am outside and enjoying the weather already!

You don't like what there is to do, but if there were fuck all to do you wouldn't have people (like myself) with hundreds of hours played.  Its sandbox.  Maybe these types of games aren't for you.
---
People managed to glitch into it and find parts of the burrow and legendary vendor. At the very least, the physical map location already exists. They might still have to add the vendor, dungeon entrance, etc. Maybe it's all already in the game though and just deactivated
---
Does it come with awesome super powers?  Otherwise it just signifies -50% of your stuff......
---
But when will it be available?
---
Well if my Chinese commie muse dies then I can do a preeettty well Micah Bell impersonation
---
No problem. I enjoy sifting through thousands of small pieces of data.
---
Updates usually happen around noon CST, so I believe that would sadly be early morning of the following day in NZ
---
You still here trying to make me look bad fam? You aint the only one posting in fallout groups dog
---
The weekly reset. Like it says in the title
---
If they wanted people to hoards ungodly amounts of junk they'd just increase stash sizes instead of making it easier to stash stuff on other characters.....I mean if they go to all the work to make it easily transferable, why not just make it easy and increase stash limit to 1600?
---
Workshops ;)
---
That's not tru. I buy stuff for caps all the time.
---
Did he have a weapon out when you knocked him down? What color was his dot on your compass when he was down?
---
Same position. Ive been creating 50 cals to scrap, but they are easier to come by than the cryolators. I'm pretty sure the cryo's are cheaper to build as well, so if you're looking to specialize against bosses, go with the cryo plans and just scrap every 50 cal you find until you save enough for the plans again. It should only take about 2-3 days of selling at max before you can get a new set of plans!
---
clunk clunk clunk! im also not a big fan of PA suits clunking around as i run
---
Got the Stone Benches plan? I've been struggling to find that and it seems like one of the more rare plans out there.
---
Thank god. So I can run it over and over.
---
I don't think it's as dire as you say - sometimes you, as a player, just have to decide "I'm going to walk to this location" and take the scenic route - but I feel you are correct that it often feels like a good 70% of the map feels completely irrelevant once you reach a high level.  Nothing in the Forest, Toxic Valley or Ash Heap can kill you.
---
On one hand, I think this could be helped by having more West-Tek-style dungeons in the world.  Each region should have at least one or two of its own, isolated from the overworld so they don't cause problems for low-levels.  But that doesn't really solve the fast traveling aspect.  You have to make it more interesting to walk from place-to-place.  You need more enemies who roam and act independently of named locations.  You need more random encounters that can yield something interesting.
---
The worst offender is the Savage Divide, imo.  Enemies can be tough when you find them... but there's a *lot* of nothing in between and everything kind of looks the same.
---
so you scrolled through 3 days worth of post in a reddit that has hundreds of post every day and found mine which literally has zero traction. ***I bet dawg I bet***
---
I‚Äôm always surprised that for a group of people that are so into this game also never keep themselves informed
---
Nope, every weapon effect that changes the name is a primary effect, which you can only have one of. Instigating is the best. Due to the long reload time, with a dragon you're really looking for that first shot kill. Two shot adds +25% damage (although if we understand explosive correctly it also increases that), anti-armor adds +26.1% damage, and instigating adds +100% damage for the first shot if enemy has full hp. One of these is clearly superior for sniping
---
No thanks
---
I gotta say, I think it'll come most likely as a maintenance update, since in previous Bethesda Replies that have stated that they plan to have also bug fixes and patches for things such as being unable to add mods to items, so I doubt that it'll be like Fasnacht.
---
What about the 2 buildings that tend to spawns legendaries in watoga? That was usually part of my farm too
---
TSE TESLA RIFLE...
---
My good is that thing fun.
---
I regularly dump plans and low level legendaries on new players. 
---
I did so one night before I logged off, next time I got on my best chameleon armor piece was missing.
---
I must have gave someone a better gift than I thought lol.
---
sorry that happened to you!
---
I think in the future, you can avoid this by making your best guns a favorite so the heart appears next to them, then it gives a prompt asking if you really want to sell/drop the item
---
Because you're making the whole game a grinding fest for yourself. You don't **need** to be level 400. You don't **need** the best legendary gear.
---
You aren't forced to endlessly grind those areas. Literally nothing is preventing you from going to do something else.
---
bad bot
---
If there are no other effects on them, the two shot does 125% damage (if both bullets hit) and the AA does 126.1% damage
---
Yeah it would be nice NOT having to drop and go to SE corner from anywhere to do sbq
---
You get attacked a *lot* up there.  I had a friend who built there (near the bee on the map).  Every time you'd go to his CAMP, it was a brawl with Lv. 68 Super Mutants, Stingwings and wolves.
---
Thank you. Normally says beforehand but nothing at the moment. Much appreciated.
---
If you read any of the posts, you would see we don't have an exact time but assume it is the weekly reset, just like Fasnatch.
---
If you sort this sub by New you will see that several people have asked it.
---
The answer is the same as always - no one knows.  It will start when it starts and end when it ends.
---
I don't think EMS was but the spawn rate there was pretty low. The top level of the Civic center had good odds before but I haven't gone there as much because of the surrounding area outside being nerfed.
---
Np

Check the first comment here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aedxlm/hard\_numbers\_on\_armor\_piercing\_qualities\_data\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aedxlm/hard_numbers_on_armor_piercing_qualities_data_for/)
---
Fallout 76 needs to take a cue from Elder Scrolls Online, and change it so that all enemies scale to your level. The more levels you gain, the harder the game becomes until you reach level 50.
---
Then, suddenly, the entire game map has the same difficulty once you reach that point, and it keeps the challenge going. I feel most players skip a lot of events because the legendaries that spawn only drop level 40 loot or lower, so people don't feel the need to engage in those events.
---
So they are very close then. My two shot also has 12 more base damage so that's why it may seem a little better.
---
I'm trying to determine which one to sell.
---
Pretty sure since the last update it asks you to confirm if you want to drop favourited weapons. That's a start but there's also armour you don't want to clog up your favourites wheel. 
---
There just needs to be a tag for "do not drop, do not scrap, do not trade."
---
Here is a big post on it and it links to a second post on the subject;
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asouq3/psa_anti_armor_is_actually_always_better_than_two/
---
hey ever thought of idk ummmm fixing your damn game before releasing new content?
---
Just spent two hours in watoga farming and got nothing.
---
on a side note the other legendary creatures around the map seem to be dropping multiple legendaries at a time
---
As someone who plays solo and has no way to move items, yes please
---
I can understand that, I meant more along the lines of allowing you to swim underwater though
---
One of my best play sessions was very similar. A low level asked to team up. I helped him through a fight, gave him some aids, and went on my way. After farming West Tek, I traveled to my camp, having forgotten that I was still on a team. The player was crafting at my weapons bench when I got to my camp. They then followed my through farming all of the big locations. An hour later, they had gained 3 levels. They were obviously leveling up an alt, as they were very good at getting in quick shots, then getting out of the way to let me finish everything off. I play a lone wanderer with no mic, but I'd volunteer for this type of fun all the time if I could.
---
None of those things cost them money other than paying people. And they are making much more than enough to do just that. It doesn‚Äôt cost anything to write code other than paying the folks who do it.
---
Others have given the correct answer, but with that much you have missed a bunch of opportunities to make stable flux which is needed for a few higher end things such as a rad shower and some power armor mods. I would make sure to make it stable right after your nuke run or it will turn inert.
---
Omg thanks. I really missed that one.
---
F
---
But when will it be available??? /s
---
Level 4-5 Makeshift Warrior helps tremendously, I have it at both levels and interchange as I need to, but it would  be so much better to repair it to 200%. as I could drop the levels of MW and use the points for something else.  I can repair my All Rise to 200%, I just don't know why they can't patch the Grogs.  Oh well, after 200 levels, 150 using Grogs, it would be more of a QOL thing for me at this point.
---
Zetan items would be better
---
Hahaha, I know, right?  Nothing here at all.
---
I‚Äôve been looking for the candles and lanterns since I got the game (just after release)
---
Also just because people aren‚Äôt commenting that doesn‚Äôt mean that the post was not read and even agreed with I‚Äôm just a messenger anyhow
---
You, sir, have the right idea.
---
Don't make me send you to your room young man. If you keep this up I will ground you no video games for a week.
---
for my build, it weighs less than purified water.
---
One of my equipped armor pieces regens health out of battle, and overencumbered, I walk everywhere....
---
pop a couple inert flux, I'm rehydrated and good to go.
---
We have the same problem. We show up, we look mean and have some great equipment. Sometimes we end up spawning in stupid things like 60s mutants or scorchel beasts. When they see us nuke them in seconds they run over the hill faster than the Roadrunner when he sees the coyote...
---
In my CAMP spot, which I've had for 40+ levels now and refuse to move, I'd say it can't be placed about 1 out of every 5 times I login so on those days I take it as a hint from the RNG gods that I should change things up.  I stay in world without a CAMP and on those play sessions I will accept invites, take workshops, etc.  I also stash stuff constantly assuming someone may PvP me.  But if my CAMP is in world I don't accept anything nor do I take a workshop just in case.
---
Once they make CAMPs invulnerable like players are I won't be so worried.  Someone PvPing me and killing me is fine but rebuilding my camp is a PITA.
---
Thank you! This is exactly what I was looking for.
---
If your on pc I can help you sometime this week with it
---
If it's like Fasnatch that was at 3 pm est, it's 10:00 am est. so maybe 5 hours
---
Bruh thinks its impossible to scroll through a feed and do a bit of research duh im not lazy like you or the exploiting that workshop item doofus
---
Right, which is also bad, there has to be a better way
---
The only time i found him i killed it immediatly, didn't know it was a "special" encounter :(
---
No, if I had said there were more bugs added than bugs squashed, then you would be making a valid point. I only stated that every time they fix bugs, there are different bugs found. Not more than before. I cant believe that 7 months into the game, they introduce a fix that causes people to not be able to mod their weapons lol. It really feels like they have no playtesters anymore
---
Two shot is more effective. Let's calculate.
---
The damage formula is `Damage * MIN(0.99, 0.5 * (Damage / DR)^0.366))`
---
Let's attack a DR 120 enemy with a Handmade of base damage 100:
---
`100 * MIN(0.99, 0.5 * (100/120)^0.366)` = **46.77** damage
---
Now add anti-armor (halves DR):
---
`100 * MIN(0.99, 0.5 * (100/60)^0.366)` = **60.28** damage (+28.8%)
---
Now use Two-shot (+25% damage)
---
`125 * MIN(0.99, 0.5 * (125/120)^0.366)` = **63.44** damage (+35.6%)
---
Now use a versus effect (+30% damage vs an enemy type)
---
`130 * MIN(0.99, 0.5 * (130/120)^0.366)` = **66.93** damage (+43.1%)
---
Anti-armor + Perforating Magazine + Tank Killer:
---
`100 * MIN(0.99, 0.5 * (100/23)^0.366)` = **85.56** damage (+82.9%)
---
Two shot + Perforating Magazine + Tank Killer:
---
`100 * MIN(0.99, 0.5 * (100/46)^0.366)` = **90.05** damage (+92.0%)
---
Due to the diminishing returns of the DR, increasing the damage by 10% is more effective than decreasing the DR by 10%.
---
What a creep
---
I question the sanity of those people hahaha
---
You just watched us melt the scorched beast that was murdering you in 5 seconds flat, now you turned your attention to US????
---
&gt;  So we will solve the first problem: the lack of motivation to play in all regions of the game world. 
---
There is no "lack" in playing all regions. I am level 140+ and I always go back to lower level zones, because doesn't matter if I play in high level or low level, container contain same level aid items. So instead of being idiot and fighting with high level monsters, you go low levels and get same resources.
---
So now if you scaled monster to on par with high level zone monsters, this thing dies out and what happens is just opposite- there is no point going to low level zones, because that is like high level zone now. So instead of doing different thing in different zones, you do everything in one zone, because it doesn't matter, enemy is always same strong.
---
Even now, you have daily quests, that reward you rare outfits. Means there is always incentive to go back into low level zones. 
---
&gt; Add powerful mini-bosses to the game world, make their spawn places absolutely random, not even associated to marked locations. 
---
This only promotes even more of fast traveling. The problem is in the core concept of the F76, what is that everything is RNG based. In traditional online game it is Challenge vs Players, but here it is RnG vs Player. In traditional online game you don't wait aimlessly or fast travel around like you do in F76, because there you have given clear challenge to beat, what is always up and ready for you to take. In traditional online game your failure comes from not being able to beat the challenge. In F76 there is no challenge. Only way to fail something is to change server right before event goes up or log out. So in F76 there is no such thing as: "Ohh, i need to go do this!" and get rewarded. You waste your time doing nothing progressive, hopping that RnG smiles and some event you need comes up. And then you hope that event rewards you what you need.
---
Anecdotal as well. The point is we don't really have hard numbers and Bethesda isn't open about it.
---
Me too.  :)
---
People can love the game without keeping up with every small change that‚Äôs made. Lots of people have lives outside of games and don‚Äôt bother reading into a bunch of stuff when they can simply ask people who already know for a faster and more direct answer.
---
I really would like to know why this got unsticky to? Nobody owes me anything but it's kind of interesting that this got done sticky the same day the updates coming out.
---
Don't you think you guys should keep this up top until we know what's going on? You just going to get a lot more of the same posts If This Disaster goes through.
---
It's easily done..one minute you're kneeling over a fellow human in need trying to be the good samaritan and bang! You're  chewing on their rib cage...no biggie really
---
I'm down.
---
160 levels and this is something i haven't learned yet... wow.
---
I would love it.
---
Played the first 30 lvl a lot with throwing knives and I loved it :)
---
Rambo (Crossbow), arrows detonate after 4 seconds of being fired.
---
Brain freeze (drill), does cryo damage that increases with more hits.

---
We really need the ESO level scale system in this game so bad
---
Yes. And put on the Contractor perk for that and building. I know that card saved me a lot of copper when I was putting in conduit. I assume it works to repair, but idk because I rarely need to repair anything where I camp now.
---
It probably starts on same time as parade event started. Was it 2 or 4 hours from now.
---
It doesn't though. There are a ton of surrounding locations and roaming mobs that spawn 2-3 star. The only bad thing about this is now people won't stay in watoga and will start finding the actual good places I farm legendaries and plans.
---
We aren't planning on any downtime. The Burrows will be enabled a bit later today!
---
Yes because you get more exp and chances to get special legendaries. 
---
You won‚Äôt stand much of a pvp threat to higher levels but you may still be able to catch them off guard if you feel like it. If you keep to yourself you should be ok. Just be friendly but keep your ear to the ground too.
---
Pretty sure all of your problems will be solved by Legendary Players
---
Just rolling with the Not my real Dad comment. Lol Also shows your age kiddo that's why I'm being nice.
---
I‚Äôve been looking for neon letters since the beta and still haven‚Äôt found them. I also recently started looking for the Winter Jacket and Jeans
---
awesome.  
---
We should have a "adopt a newbie" program. 
---
80% of my endgame time is looking for helpless people lost in all those quest marks you have at the beginning lol
---
Oh were you the dude from hemlock holes who brought 6 people?
---
Hey, one time pretty close to game release bigot 50 out of one. The most I've gotten since is 3.
---
Sorry, those are PC traders. 
---
The legendary drops being bad is only getting worse as Bethesda keeps turning off or lowering legendary spawns.
---
I worry that Bethesda is hoping to make tokens that can be purchased in the atom shop and traded to the legendary vendor for a chance at a decent legendary.
---
Absolutely yes
---
Same as every patch, i dont know man, here in europe it is 4pm for britain 3pm. It is complicated, don't attack on me haha
---
Both need more than a skin to look cool.
---
I mean, I found a nice piece of 3\* Cavalier Trapper chest armor yesterday, and instead of being like "Wow, Cavalier armor," I was, "Holy crap, I look terrible."  This is one of those cases where I will sacrifice functionality for looks.
---
But it's got nothing on Heavy Robot Torso.  The stupid looking spikes in the back.  Why couldn't it look a bit more svelte, like an Assaultron chest or even a Protectron?  I guess its origins as Rust Devil armor explain the Raider additions, but they really have no taste.
---
That just meant The Burrows is intended to be balanced for 2 or more level 50+ players and will be tough to take on alone. It's not instanced, and you can bring as many or as few players with you as you'd like.
---
It‚Äôs crazy not to. Survival provides a 20% exp boost which is super useful. 
---
Damage is scaled. A level 5 with a pipe rifle can take down a level 200 in power armor so long as you see them first. 
---
Are there level 300 pros with bloodied explosive guns and chameleon armor who will wreck you? Yes. Typically at Whitesprings. But they‚Äôre the exception, not the rule. 
---
One of the better pvp builds right now is stealth vats crit build with silenced rifles. That‚Äôs the build I run and I win most of my fights without any insane weapons. I use an instigating lever action or my basic silenced handmade rifle. The key is to get a vats crit to the head.
---
This happened the first couple times with the prize bot. Now I wait for my prize first then blast him.
---
SBQ is just there to eat the piles of dwellers that the flying blenders left behind.
---
Don't do like ESO, it's stupid. There is basically one enemy in that game and it's copied across the map. Just multiply all damage in the game by 3. This alone will solve most of the problems.
---
I recall official announcements about faction war, I wonder what happened at Bethesda that changed that plan
---
wtf does that mean? and its ***dawg***
---
Screws or gears, when hunting I find boxes of them and I get all excited. Only to realize later I was only get 1 in a god damned box. 
---
A BOX SHOULD BE 10 DAMMIT!!
---
anti-armor does not directly increase the damage, that's just based on how the armor mechanics work in this game. two-shot will show up as stronger because it gains an actual damage buff while anti-armor just makes the enemy take more damage
---
There should be a big loud audible beep warning or something on the pip boy.

Racist?

Youre still off topic dog the workshop gimmick is lame and you wlare def the type to exploit it get wrecked fam

I wasn't aware of that; I don't generally check the patch notes after patch day.

Do you have a link to the addendum and the apology?

Except its not as simple as that - the 2nd shot is based on base weapon damage, so you don't get the full 25%, just 25% of base weapon damage.  On a modded weapon with mods that increase weapon damage, two shot is worse than anti-armor.  Plus the increased wear and spread of two-shots...  makes TS pretty much trash.  AA or Furious is a better choice - the latter more for boss killing, AA for general purpose.
---
That sub is filled with nothing but whiney children who hate nothing more than having their ideas challenged.
---
ugh im sorry that happened to you, it sounds like they probably were doing that to everyone they came across, and you were right to jump servers, probably the only way to deal with them
---
Depends on the other 2 legendary effects
---
There could be cheaper Excavator power armor skins because they charged like 10 dollars for one skin while you could pay 15 for a pack of like 4 power armor skins
---
Okay.  Thanks..  been looking in those two spots like crazy but will keep at it.
---
&gt;I think it would be broken if power armor was always better in every scenario.
---
But hasn't that been the point of PA in all other FO series? PA has always been uber. My complaint is that someone can sneaky one shot crit vat kill you with a TSE shotgun in PA. I should at least take a few hits cause it's freaking power armor. the immersion of being in a walking tank that is treated like tinfoil against someone in a trench coat is game breaking in my opinion.
---
It‚Äôs not a new patch. It was added with the last patch and they‚Äôre just gonna enable it now.
---
The weekly reset...
---
My thought as well
---
Okay... thanks   been looking at those two spots like crazy, but will keep at it.
---
Cryptids should drop something really, really cool. Like something you could display in your camp when they start allowing that... or something unique, hard to get, like the eye of Ra but different. As it is, I dont bother killing cryptids -- they're like the SBQ or Sheepscrotch, the loot is not worth it. I mean I still kill those things because the adds are where it's really at for legendaries AND I want that damn imposter head... I have 15 Wolf fedoras if anyone wants one
---
I'm just messing with ya haha. I've read maybe 20 of these posts it's not like it changes every update lol it's always after reset
---
does it have a lake nearby by any chance. search on that.
---
Why dont you roll with me in saying that this exploit sucks instead?
---
&gt; fanatic Bethesda lovers.
---
Implying nerfing legendary spawns is somehow some heinous thing that makes bethesda purely evil and terrible.
---
ah , not that im happy it happened to you at all, but im relieved to know its an actual bug and im not just going crazy, my x-01 helmet just up and disappeared 2 nights ago after my server disconnected in the middle of the SBQ fight
---
so it seems there is yet another bug bethedsa created F
---
Yea they said so about two inside the vaults ago, so itll be sometime soon, they mention bobbleheads and weapons on display
---
I'm always killing him and get the certificate, that I've been insulted...
---
The game is laughably easy. I'm sure we'll be able to complete it solo.
---
There are just spot on the map the your under seige my dad has the same issue
---
Yes pls
---
Yeah ok, did you do a single thing I said before you lipped off? If not your statement means nothing to me.
---
cool!
---
Indeed. The amount of people who haven't noticed the game is on a two week update cycle is staggering.
---
No notifications yet, just checked twitter
---
How do u know what's next?
---
Everything they do is tied to $$ not necessarily players‚Äô happiness. They can‚Äôt be up front about it because it‚Äôs not convenient. It‚Äôs like admitting they cut off people‚Äôs water supply so they can sell bottled water for $50 each. This nerf likely has something to do with their legendary vendor thing.
---
Probably will be like Fasnatch, no down time to make it go live.
---
I liked fallout for lol
---
same I'm wondering if they forgot that today is the day they're supposed to release it because they were busy trying to fix their other game that crashed yesterday
---
I have rad shower but for what kinda power armor I need it?
---
I'm looking for some people too, all my old friends quit the game. Add DemWafflez if you want. I'm lvl 230+
---
There goes my hero!
---
We can spam without animation but we need to stop dmging to use stimpacks in PA so more or less it's the same without PA and animation. And I diluted my stims. Why not with super-duper and chemicalist u get tons of stims. U like the normal stims. I'm not they heal to much and  the dmg from unyielding goes away so I have more stimpacks from perk cards and I do more dmg to enemy's means I need less stinpacks is a win win I would say.  But I just started not more sure maybe 2 weeks ago and I'm just lvl 71 and fighter the sqb just once :(
---
If u one shot kill every creature without giving them a chance to shoot back is less challenging. I agree that its not that more challenging but i use a TSE shot and gatling and enemies dont seem bullet sponges to me
---
If you tip enough, maybe.
---
50% limb damage, +1perception
---
And I thought my house was nice
---
If they're doing that do you know where the manhole covers are? 
---
my first time in Harpers ferry ( November ) there was a manhole cover but since going back I can't find them. 
---
 At least they told everyone before about the fachnacht event
---
You just find somebody you trust to temporarily hold on to your gear. So you make a new character, leave the vault, and make a camp with a stash box. Then, you give your stuff t your friend, swap to your new character, and them he gives your stuff back to you.
---
I really hate that the community on this sub thinks legendary farming is 
---
* The only thing to do in the game
---
* Should not have been nerfed
---
How the fuck do you guys have fun server hopping every 5 seconds to check the same location for the same enemies endlessly? 
---
**Do something else**. They *should* change legendary spawns. Make them rarer. Make it so people can't just server hop all day. Make people actually explore the map.
---
I have the exact same setup.  I launch a nuke or start  the sheepsquash event and then mid battle, it freezes.  I wish they will fix this problem already.
---
Be careful, mate. I hear he likes to eat people.
---
Hell YA! Get to the chopper!
---
Thanks for your work that other guy enunimes or whatever his name is gave me a bunch of crap on another thread about this subject, glad you documented the crap outta it.
---
And I not like to grind stims(what I never did) enemy's drop them like piniatas
---
It's actually a feature that has been in Bethesda games since oblivion and fallout 3.
---
I would pay like maybe 10k for it.
---
They didn't tell anyone, until about 1 pm, est, which was 2 hours before, it went live. so if they do this at 3 pm est again it's going to be 5 hours.
---
I don't know if it makes anyone dumb but like I said it caught everyone off gaurd! Most people probably ignore the onscreen text and keep shooting! Lol
---
Doesn't this mean as soon as the dungeon comes out the entire server is just going to be running through it at the same time?
---
Kinda ruins the experience
---
It‚Äôs very easy to base it on that when a week ago you could hop on some servers and you would find an upward of 5 legendaries in watoga at times.
---
I literally found a  bloodied spear just yesterday. Lol
---
I usually stay on one server most of the time.  The server hopping was for this test.  
---
Maybe if the loot reflected at the very least the proper number of stars of the enemy, then I can understand your point.  I love the game and I certainly don't only legendary farm, but I'm a solo player and my character needs good gear, especially for the upcoming content.
---
Beth rep just said it's not instanced -- don't know how to feel about that. On one hand, it'll make it easier for people to group up together, but on the other hand, doesn't that mean it'll be like any other location, and if someone has recently done it, you'll have to server hop etc. to try to find one that's not cleared out yet?
---
Seriously though, can we PLEASE have 3 star legendaries drop 3 star items. That by itself would motivate me to explore more. I consistently get one star or no items off 3 star legendaries. I thought they fixed that? NOPE. What's the point if I can't even hope for a decent drop in a whole gaming session? Or two or three sessions?
---
Awesome
---
Those are purchasable from the WS furniture vendor only, "Antique Lights Plan"
---
Hope I helped!
---
That‚Äôs how it should work, Vampire weapons were bugged before and were able to heal you even if you hit the empty space in front of you, dmg or not. Now you have to land a hit/deal dmg for it to heal you.
---
 I seen them comment on a post here on Reddit the day before telling people that the event was going to be starting at 3 p.m.
---
Maybe no one asked yet
---
If you look around, I think there is an unmarked fissure close to that area.
---
THIS sounds GREAT. Like a mini-SBQ event. You see a rad storm in the distance and you drop your junk off and run over and gleefully start killing higher level mobs
---
Nah it's plenty enough as is. Remember it is heavy and hand cranked, it isn't gonna fire too fast
---
Now and then we hear a story of a person who lost half his stuff because they tried to do this alone inatead of securely trading the items.
---
Yea, I‚Äôm interested to see how it works without it being instanced.
---
Thanks for the heads up and for wading the official forums so I don't have to :)
---
So do I just need a launch card and these codes? Solo player never tried before. I have the card just dont know if i still have to hunt down the code pieces first.
---
Well, I find that "main appeal" appealing.  If I wanted what you suggest, I'd just use the Minigun.  The Gatling Gun is supposed to be a chunky anachronistic thing, sort of like the various Black Powder weapons.  That's its niche.
---
So they are not fixing the bugs from last patch
---
Agreed. I liked it for a week. Then the constant pictures of nothing became too much. Then the bad mouthing of anyone who wasn't them became too much. After a while I just couldn't take the "DAE play Fallout 76 like this **filthy casual** does?" or "look at my 4x4 house that is uninteresting in every way, perfect for **this** filthy casual" posts. I rather bushwhack through the 100 "bethesda please" posts than look at more mediocre pics of literally nothing interesting.
---
I'm not sure - I am on the verge of moving my camp but I'll look if I'm back in the area. It was such a neat idea for a camp too! Most of it in a cave with a building around the entrance.
---
Charleston Fire Dept is also great for lead.
---
You got it!
---
Make the fast hands melee perk affect the crank speed again, I mean come on if I have fast hands for melee I should be able to crank a crank faster.
---
all i care about is the update that will make our CAMP invulnerable in adventure mode
---
So we have to wait yet again for a fix to mod our gear, it's been a week BUGTHESDA!
---
Yeah they said at 3 pm, 1 hour after they first said in about a hour. thought so at 2 pm they said 3. it was supposed to be 2. but they are saying for this burrows, it will be later today, they will probably tell us a exact time a hour before
---
I‚Äôd take the 3star. Furious on a fist weapon is only good on major boss fights.
---
Our guess is with player vending we will get the option to start decorating more.
---
Also limited items in aromic shop end in 1hour. That is time when it open maybe.
---
I wouldn't rag on people who love getting legendaries. Everyone plays their own way. They wouldn't put legendaries in the game if they didn't want people to get excited over them and flip out over the perfect one. I agree, they put themselves in that position but it's Bethesda's job to make the legendary aquisition more exciting for those people.
---
I ken that but I think  it could still keeps its main appeal and be more satisfying if it got a 10-15% fire rate buff.
---
I guess not.  Mods are still broken :(
---
I hoping that this is what the "Nuclear Winter" game mode will be. All areas will be scaled to Max level.
---
Nope. You just need the launch card and then pick your silo, do your run and punch in that silos code. Don't need to get all the pieces. Good luck! Make sure to use the weapon benches every chance you get cause they will break down there. Take backups and lots of bullets.
---
Let's hope if they're doing it that way that'll give us a little bit more time.
---
Also do you know where the manholes are because I haven't being able to find them in a while
---
Likewise, I don't believe a single person on that dev team lays in bed and doesn't touch their phone even occasionally.   If my character is resting I still wanna check the map for events and stuff.
---
Some Vampire weapons are awesome and super helpful it longer/tougher fights.
---
Sounds like it was stealth fixed. I had a vampire's ripper a few months back and it didn't do any healing at all. Meanwhile vampire's knives could be used to slash at the empty air for infinite recovery
---
I still have a vampire's plasma thrower though, that always worked well
---
I'm the conductor of the poop train!
---
Nope. It needs to stay slow. All of the other heavy guns have a fast fire rate. It's like saying a bolt hunting rifle needs to fire fast because the combat sniper can. No thanks, it's made that way to be appealing.
---
Endless grinding/farming is part of any game like this. If you can't be bothered grinding for ages, you spend in-game currency to buy it from someone who can be bothered to farm it.
---
Have you never played games like WoW? because the drop rates for rare shit in that game are far below legendary spawns in this.
---
I don't think you know what that word means.
---
I literally gave you half a dozen of sources, observations, and trends. How is that **not** research.
---
Since you have zero evidence to support your claim, I'm going to take that as a "you're right fakeinternetpointss, you have more evidence than I could ever come up"
---
Enjoy the rest of your life.
---
Use the 10mm SMG as your primary and tell me ammo is super common for it.
---
I can't stop laughing!!! "Look at this fucking guy eating people" LMAO
---
you can eat people who are downed??
---
Yeah... I found that out the hard way.  I lost all my BETA photos :c
---
Nice, thanks!
---
There's a fissure site there.  They spawn scorchbeasts (which are psychic, and know where you are without line of sight) every 15 minutes or so if the previous one spawned is dead.  Either deal with the scorchbeasts regularly or move are your only options
---
&gt; but its not fair to have people exploit an item in the system like that.
---
You mean like how you were exploiting the system to get inside?
---
This exact thing happened to me. I'm sorry fam. 
---
I'm on PS4 as well. Are you me?
---
That has to be the dumbest thing I've heard in a while.
---
I feel like I‚Äôm about to charge onto the beaches of Normandy. Let‚Äôs go!
---
I do believe the map is accessible while sitting or resting, just not the pip-boy.
---
It'll just be a new location like west tek or any other area with high level enemies. 
---
The problem is that it's a NEW location. So of course, the second it unlocks, literally everyone on the server's gonna be outside waiting to go in.
---
Enemies are gonna be done in 3 seconds.
---
Patrolling the Mojave Almost Makes You Wish For a Nuclear Winter

---

---
Damn boys, they finally found me.
---
Lol Grafton monster isn't even in Grafton
---
Although I'm aware of that bug from a while back, that's not really what I mean.  The claim I've heard was that the Vampire effect only occurred on V. Fast weapons when you first hit something, not on all the subsequent hits it does.
---
Cool - I'm fairly bummed about it, but I guess it's no big deal. I'll be moving. Even if they were easy for me to take down (which, I can solo them but it's not THAT easy to do for me), I can't maintain constantly fighting them every 15 minutes lol
---
I agree 100% though 10mm is just as easy to chew up just as any other imo
---
I find that you should really take advantage of specific sets and making use of a side arm ie a pistol of some type and at least some perks into melee
---
P atrolling t he M ojave A lmost M akes Y ou W ish F or a N uclear W inter
---
Well ok I guess my option is in the minority, Id still like to see if with a new receiver or the fast hand perk but I can deal. The weapons still great its just not as satisfying to use as Id like it to be, at least not satisfying to me.
---
Interesting that‚Äôs a first for me
---
I think it's more to do with the crying wolf with no actual facts. How dare people not make knee jerk reactions when some  saysI ran something 3 times and it just doesn't feel right. 
---
A larger amount of data is needed. More along the lines of what OP posted.
---
Yay! Another week of not being able to mod my Power Armor!
---
I‚Äôm with you in this and have thought that a changing landscape and structure would be beneficial to a game they hope to keep alive ‚Äúforever‚Äù. There are challenges concerning new players coming into that world, but I think the empty, desolate wasteland void of ALL human life disappearing is ok. Late-comers to the game will miss that era and that‚Äôs ok. Guess what? That would emulate the changes in real life more. You‚Äôre born after an era, there are things from that era you will never experience. The original storyline would still be present, and a small spattering of human NPCs could have dialogue that reflected that storyline. Interesting to talk about and imagine! I‚Äôm about it.
---
No. Source: https://bethesda.net/community/topic/336048/tomorrow-16-05-2019-patch-with-the-new-dungeon/53?language%5B%5D=en&amp;lang=en-US&amp;page=3
---
In a way this might be kind of fun. I enjoyed having most of the server in the same place during Fasnacht, but I can see how it would make the dungeon a bit of a mess.
---
I've read that it will work and can help.  Here are other things I've had good experience with personally:
---
* Tesla rifle - clear those bomb bots easily by shooting the ground near them
---
* Fireproof perk - don't die to the bomb bots!
---
* Cryolator - works well to freeze the SheepSquatch, expect to use 200-500 cryo cells
---
But there are NPCs.
---
yup.  I really like my cultist dagger :)
---
I know the spot well.  If you place your camp halfway up the cliff face, you can grab both the lead and acid.  You will be attacked about every 15 to 20 minutes.  The fissure is just Northeast of the cave.
---
Actually there is a scorchbeast in the forest its just peaceful. And there are destroyed fissure sites in the forest also.
---
It literally was that until the latest update...
---
Why would you have to server hop because the vendors are low on caps?  Server hopping doesn't affect how many caps the vendors have.
---
I'm thinking more of fully voiced human NPC's like in previous Bethesda titles.
---
Aha yes I‚Äôve been searching for the lanterns forever. Thank you!
---
I agree wholeheartedly and would add that I actually LIKE that I have to spend Caps to fight a difficult enemy - 2k for a match-up with a Max Level 3* Cryptid that rewards the Player with Top Tier loot - sign me up!
---
The encryptid event works with so many players because it's 
---
* Pretty difficult
---
* Has a fuck ton of enemies
---
* Has an actual mechanic 
---
So unless this dungeon has mechanics and VERY hard enemies, people today are gonna steamroll through it.
---
*brothers and sisters in arms
---
Looks like trying out things to implement without maintenance. Nice.
---
CAMP building is my endgame
---
just last night my CAMP was destroyed by griefers, im gutted
---
Don‚Äôt feed the troll.
---
Not for dropping, but I believe it does that for scrapping (from what I've read).  I haven't tested it, I just unknowingly dropped my sniper and only noticed when I went to check how much ammo it had (fortunately, in my base and mere seconds later).
---
I agree with the armor situation too.  I don't think you can favorite armor (??), but I'd say, anything favorited, worn, or renamed should always give you a warning when dropped, sold, or scrapped.
---
I've read that holding the fire button causes the weapon to fire at a slightly slower rate than repeated manual firing would.  You could probably get your speed increase that way.
---
Do you happen to know where the manhole covers are for the entrance?
---
My experience is that the shared vendor cap pool resets 20 hours after you first sell them something, reliably.
---
Yeah, I understand that, but it might be fun to steamroll through it with a ton of people once or twice. Could be an interesting experience. 
---
Not the first time though, I agree.
---
I pictured Braveheart, They can take our stimpacks but not our JUNK!
---
No, althought, I have been looking everywhere, aside armory, btw what platform do you play on.
---
Nope! We're not planning on any downtime or a patch, The Burrows will unlock within the next couple of hours.
---
I am claiming that my views are anecdotal. 
---
And your research involves reddit subscription numbers going up. It becomes anecdotal when you claim that is slow and proves a reducing player base.
---
Both of us are using anecdotes to express a feeling of growth or reduction. No need to freak out dude
---
The cap pool has nothing to do with the servers, it‚Äôs tied to your character and how long it‚Äôs been since you started selling to them last. 20 hours after you sell, the cap pool refreshes.
---
Sorry I do not.
---
It is like this because it means that you can go to one vendor and get max caps for the day without having to run to different vendors. Honestly it is an improvement to the old system
---
It's not worth it playing. Period.
---
They have confirmed no update or down time for the borrows
---

 &gt; Nope! We're not planning on any downtime or a patch, The Burrows will unlock within the next couple of hours.
---
Sadness - no bug fixes.
---
Thank you. Just wondering if the entrances are already on the map? Just want to scout out the locations to make it easier to start later
---
It's 1.4k caps every roughly every 24 hours. It might be 20 hours, but in either case you cannot exceed that amount. If it doesn't look refreshed, try selling something and it will show the refreshed amount. 
---
The change actually made it easier, if you are selling things, you no longer need to hop anywhere.
---
Yeah it's just a waiting game at this point I think it's already in the game but they haven't pushed it like the mask event from a few weeks back
---
Scroll down a couple post
---
Fraud-tec engineers - its just works :)
---
While yes I agree the look terrible I would love to trade with peeps with out having to worry that I sold my actual armor or weapons.
---
Cap pools reset 20 hours after you folirst sell to the vendor. If it says only 10 or zero caps and it has been 20+ plus hours, try selling something. It will normally update the vendor cap value. This has been a known bug since the begining.
---
I‚Äôm not near the game to check which ones, but I‚Äôm fairly certain I needed some for my jet pack mod and some mutation serums. I keep several of each flux just in case a need comes up like when someone attacked my base and broke my rad shower.
---
Oh okay I appreciate it!! :)
---
Lol no I don't.
---
Will do that thankyou! :)
---
Hopefully they understated how hard the dungeon actually is. And hopefully the enemies scale.
---
So bringing 10 people would still actually be a fun challenge.
---
So there will be no fixes for the different issues after the last patch today, like not being able to apply mods, etc.. etc.. ./
---
I was not aware of that.
---
anti-armor grognak does well.  
---
Slow, but ignores 50% armor.  Think mine is listed @ 184/hit.
---
15 Str but only a single 2 hand weapon perk - majority of my perks are one hand melee.
---
I play on PS4 currently I do have it on Xbox one but I just got more into it on the PlayStation. 
---
And me too on the searching I have gone around all the streets where you would think they would be all the little side patches of grass near it I haven't gone through the inside of the armory to see if it's in there but that's the next place I'm looking now
---
There's no planned patch or downtime, The Burrows will unlock within the next couple of hours!
---
It's torture that I found some good mods like Reactive plates and can't use it.....
---
That would be nice actually.
---
I tried to camp there one time, if you place your camp half way up the cliff you can place a lead extractor and a acid extractor.  The scorch beasts come from the fissure not to far away, your best bet is to put your workbenches in the cave and forgo the elaborate camp. I moved after a few days because I got tired of rebuilding.
---
IDK i checked again last night and only one ore per collect :(
---
I think they‚Äôre waiting for the Sheer Terror bundle to end in a little over an hour before updating, so people get the full window to purchase before Burrows releases
---
The Burrows will come online within the next couple of hours, and we have no planned downtime or patch. We'll let you know as soon as it's available!

We have had some major issues with this discord leading up to it being disbanded. I am looking for someone with knowledge of discord to possibly set us up one so that everything would run smoothly.
---
&gt; Due to the diminishing returns of the DR, increasing the damage by 10% is more effective than decreasing the DR by 10%.
---
Then how come that my Two shot hunting rifle with perforating mag is less effective than my anti-armor hunting rifle with perforating mag while fighting heavily armored targets such as rad scorpions, SB/Q, deathclaws and so on?
---
People keep saying that Two shots deals more damage and it is true vs ghouls and stuff like that, but when i have to kill something heavily armored i always find it that's more efficient to use my anti-armor hunting rifle.
---
Is it just me imagining things?
---
Huh, cheers. Ill be sure to try that out, it might be exactly what I'm looking for.
---
Have to admit its pretty dumb that they arent gonna have some down time to try fixing some issues. Gonna be annoyed if I'm running that dungeon and game decides to main menu me or crash to desktop lol.
---
(Added April 9) Crafting: Several craftable hats and outfits have had their crafting costs increased and Cap values decreased.
---
Dev Note: Previously, it was very easy to gain lots of caps by crafting and selling these items. We've made balance adjustments accordingly to prevent them from being exploited, without making them too difficult to craft. This was missed during our initial patch notes creation process.
---
This is under the ‚Äúadditional design and balance updates‚Äù section.
---
Im not gonna sugar coat nit for you youre not making me look bad here this isnt about me sucking at the game and not being able to get in 
---
gtfo here and stop trying to attack the op scrub
---
Besides it has happened to me before and is a totally common occurance if you get disconnected.. a lot which hd happened so either bethesda needs to totally revamp pvp again or you can mind your damn business and stop defending some one that spawn kills
---
Dang on xbox. but I don't think the manholes are here yet, I doubt they will try to hide them they'll be easy to find probably
---
Haha are you on xbox and around lvl 30? Someone ate me yesterday
---
Really?! Where? When? Gimmie a link I wanna see!
---
Get wrecked scrub
---
Why not both? Id prefer to stay interested in a game while the bugs are ironed out.
---
It's not easy to track down the source of bugs sometimes, shit takes time. 
---
Sure it's been 5-6 months, but they've undoubtedly and significantly improved the game since launch. Cut them some slack, it's free content.

and how many points do you put into each one?

Do you think this‚Äôll be like a nuked Whitesprings where everyone one-shots everything and it‚Äôs a huge cluster of everyone on the server trying to run through at the same time?
---
It‚Äôs not going to be instanced, so not sure if that‚Äôs good or bad.
---
It could definitely happen if you got very unlucky with a server crash. Aside from that, just make sure nobody is around when you stash items and give your friend a heads up so they dont leave the server to maximize your chances. Any exceptionally valuable items I'd trade to a friend though.
---
Besides you got a name like hitokiri_xero lol
---
I played Vanilla WoW for more days then I care to admit over a 2 year span played, so I'm familiar with grinding.  In WoW, you knew what mobs were going to drop what items.  In FO76, they all share one giant loot pool.  I don't want items handed to me, but the odds of anything worthwhile are god awful in this game.  I've put in a lot more hours recently but this isn't really that hardcore of an MMO so I don't think it's a fair comparison.
---
All good thanks
---
So, some NPCs I'm alright with.  Seeing the Overseer in-person, that's totally fine.  Having the odd NPC who is actually alive at the end of a quest?  Also fine.
---
What I'm more conflicted about is the introduction of things like factions, decisions, etc.  One of the things I respect most about Skyrim's design is how the game never forces you to choose between the Empire and the Stormcloaks in order to finish the main quest.  That's a bit of an anathema for Fallout, which puts its faction wars front-and-center in order to create moral dilemmas and promote replayability.  But if I were given a choice in 76, I wouldn't engage with them because I value flexibility and independence, and I would hope that is a valid option in future DLC like Wastelanders.
---
Thanks! Yeah I don't think I understood that this was how this was going to be released either.
---
I feel. Just got a legendary lever action and been waiting to install a mod that improves it. Now the mod is just sitting in my stash waiting to be used.
---
It's not like they have daily announcements. And when they do, it's not like they take more than a few minutes to read. They have weekly Inside the Vaults. Which you can get a notification when they happen.
---
You can follow the official accounts here, and easily see what they have said.
---
Anyone that has time to play video games, also has time to spend a few minutes keeping themselves up to date.
---
Sorry, but you just made excuses for people being lazy. 
---
It's not really about them having lives and such. it's about expecting everything handed to them, and special attention.
---
Part of me wants them to stick to their guns on not having human NPCs, since I see what they were going for and it really does have a huge impact on the atmosphere of the game. But ultimately I want them to do what's best for the game, and if that means bringing it closer in line to a single-player Fallout narrative I won't complain. 
---
I just hope however they include NPCs or new storylines, the writing still works for a multiplayer game. I'm not a fan of those MMOs or shared-world games where the main storyline treats you like the chosen one, and acts like every other player isn't doing the exact same thing. 76 strikes a nice balance there.
---
And if human NPCs are just going to be like the robots or Grahm where there isn't a proper dialog system, I don't really see the point.
---
The 25% fire rate legendary effect puts it at a perfect point IMO. I‚Äôve got an Instigating 25% one, my ideal is a bloody 25% one. 
---
If anyone has a B25 Gatling gun, and/or a BE 50cal, hit me up. I‚Äôve got a lot of caps and other things.
---
I have two people from work who bought the game and have tried to grind level 25 to use to Power Armor i made them just for the dungeon haha, probably still going to suck for us but oh well, should be fun
---
yes
---
Me fucking too. I cannot wait for the legendary vendor. I mean, I AM excited for The Burrows, but I‚Äôm more excited to respec my legendaries.
---
lol you going to create the GOT arm wall?
---
Thanks, I can see it now. Appreciated.
---
Scroll down a couple posts
---
Yeah I know, but how do you use it as a mule? Not asking because I want to start doing this, just curious how the logistics work.
---
I definitely got my money‚Äôs worth at $60, so yea $25 is well worth it with the new content added and more to come
---
Cate to elaborate a bit more why you like this game and so?
---
Honestly no. I don't mind people giving Bethesda feedback. Bethesda is free to decide who to listen to. But if they see a lot of people want something it at least lets them know.
---
I heard that the new content will be free, is that true?
---
Edit: nevermind, another reply explained it but I hadn't read it yet.
---
I feel the same way. If a system like this was introduced, I'd want it to be all about choice. I wouldn't want to be locked into one faction per character or anything like that. 
---
Id personally want to keep the NPC's mostly confined to whatever faction camp or hub town theyre part of to still keep the integrity if the initial idea for the game, if that makes sense.
---
Ah ok. That seems like way too much work :-p
---
You get by chance at completing the new event.
---
I get why they changed it, but at the same time, that was one of those weirdly intuitive crossover perks that should be embraced as out-of-the-box thinking rather than nerfed.  *Of course* faster hands would allow you to turn cranks faster.  Why wouldn't they?
---
I'd say $25 is definitely a good deal for the game in its current state. 
---
And yeah, you can play solo and still enjoy it. I've been playing solo for 99% of the game and it works out fine.
---
I think the CM‚Äôs apologized here when that blew up right after the patch, and then that note got added.
---
Increasing the stash has (supposedly) an effect on the server when the character is online.  If you take 100 pounds (or even 200 or 500) and move it to another character, you're decreasing the server load for that character.
---
If the other character is a mule, it certainly increases the server load there, but that character supposedly isn't on much, and with weight limitations put on now (?), that should prevent the mule from getting too terribly heavy.
---
If you want to limit hoarding, make it a transfer-only, limited to 1 item or a small stack of other things (1000 ammo, 100 aid, etc., something like that).  1 transfer at a time.
---
They don‚Äôt have to have full on mountain folk accent, but a colloquialism, a y‚Äôall thrown in here or there. For a game that wants you to immerse yourself and become part of the landscape they did a pretty poor job of representing the people that lived there before.
---
Yeah, I'm thinking along the same lines. This is a bit of a tough one for me and I wanted to see what everyone else here was thinking.
---
Oh, that's actually a very good idea, hadn't though of that. Could do the same with the guns, just strip off as much as I can...
---
Hop to a new server. It means the event was already done there too recently.
---
Glass walls could really empower all of the sole ‚Äúperv‚Äù survivor builders out there.
---
No, I don't but I do absolutely agree on being able to use my pip-boy when I do in game.
---
No. No human NPCs. It flies in the face of the whole concept. I like it as it is, I feel that, as it stands and with the future plans from Bethesda, this can evolve into a really cool user-driven setting.
---
Human NPCs take the narrative away and result in weird world issues... can we kill them (of course we do, if we can),d o they respawn? What do they offer that a Bot can't?
---
Nah, leave it as it is. Let the players create the human narrative.
---
But isn't this the church of Fallout? Don't we come here to beg for things? /sarcasm
---
Good looking out üòéüëçüèº
---
3 hour "cool down" timer on the event, someone has done it before you inside a 3 hour time window, server hop or wait :)
---
I've heard it resets on each server 2-3 hours after the last time it was done.  Server hopping or waiting are probably the way to go.
---
Invite sent
---
Guns blazing? But I‚Äôm melee üò≠
---
Whaaaat!? But the porta-pottie was already outside. Not inside a nuclear silo.
---
Yes all their dlc is free, is just cosmetics at the moment that cost ‚Äúmoney‚Äù but you can earn what they call atoms ingame as well to buy these cosmetics
---
Ya, I have one character and run solo as well. 
---
I would love to restart to have better planned my specials but I enjoy the gear and don‚Äôt want to take the loss.
---
The game is fun, but very imperfect, if you want fun, buy it. If you want clean gameplay, no bugs, no issues, and it would be a deal breaker without it, then pass on fo76.
---
TL;DR: Very fun, pretty buggy. If you want fun mostly, its defo worth it
---
Does it make you wanted? otherwise, next time I am hungry I am going to the Cryptid buffet.
---
I wouldn't put my trust in a community driven thing like a wiki, it's not the end-all be-all of information. When someone datamines that it's not either a) a plan, or b) a mod item, I wouldn't be so sure. Doesn't someone have a list compiled from the leaks of the dev room or something? I can't simply accept it's not a thing lol..
---
Yes. You did mention that a month and a half ago and it still is bugged.
---
Oh yeah the postmodern camper !
---
I've been freezing, and removing that many people would clear my friends list 4-5 times.
---
I'm fine with it the way it is (more or less).  I regularly dump extra pins on a vendor (~200 or so) just to get rid of a few and make some caps.
---
I farm regularly where there are 1-2 pin stashes, not all that many, but they still add up quick enough.
---
They said it was delayed until patch 9, May 7th I believe.
---
Yes. We're in the middle of the first batch of new content, in fact.
---
It actually didn't. I didn't even have the option to give a stimpak. Lol.
---
Stealthboys disengage when you shoot or activate.
---
You‚Äôre experiencing a variant of the chameleon glitch.
---
They only patched one variant, and 2 remain.
---
I'd say so, it has its issues, but it's still a really fun time. I grinded up to level 100 something before I started to get bored and took a break, but i just got back into it again like a week ago and I'm having a blast.
---
then Bethesda needs to stop doing ninja nerfs. problem solved
---
 &gt; It doesn‚Äôt cost anything to write code other than paying the folks who do it.
---
Weird, I heard it was going to be instanced
---
Better if you have a 1x or Ps4 pro.
---
Nah. They opened a new box, dumped them in their hand and dropped the box. Inevitably, 1 or 2 get dropped with it.
---
Plus, everyone knows that bobby pins just... show up. In bed, in the carpet, on the bathroom floor, behind the coffee pot...
---
Yep, it's where  the elevator dumps you after you exit it, you can't use it to get inside, only out. It's a "secret" elevator
---
as many gripes i have with this game, yes at THAT price point 25 bucks is what this game is worth. I'm hoping with the continued dlc and another year or two of content it can be worth the pre order money i paid for it.
---
Same. I used to sell them to get the last few caps.
---
Hahahahaha. That‚Äôs hilarious.
---
I did wonder but adding speculation to a thread about the evils of speculation seemed counterproductive so I was trying to do 'my homework' and find out under which circumstances that note was added.
---
I expect that they are pushing it out until they make sure they've minimized the risk of player's using it to dupe more items.  It seems like the fermenter was a trial run to see if people could dupe with it (they did) and if they could patch that (hopefully they were successful).  
---
Hopefully the new dungeon content today will give us something fun to do while we all wait for vending!
---
Yes, it is well worth it.
---
Harpers Ferry
---
From what I have seen of the game mechanics (stuff that's your is IN a container even if that's a glass case ... see Lying Lowe and The Military Uniforms/pistols up at the Cemetary), and the way the fermentor is working with Items to Display, my guess is that it'll be in the display cases that you can build now but not put anything in. Shelves? Probably not although I am hoping we can "decorate".
---
Here‚Äôs what u/valseek said:
---
He is for that one event but yeah, I usually find him in the southern portion of the map
---
I'm disturbed that you felt you needed to add "in a game" to that as a qualifier.
---
But even after server hopping is there a way to tell if the cool down is almost complete on that server I just hopped to??
---
What if I told you i was on a team and needed to switch characters
---
We know it's an Harpers ferry there's supposed to be one by the armory in one by highway 65 I was just wondering if anybody knew where the actual manhole covers are
---
Im sorry, but ive been trying to be supportive of the games changes, but applying mods? Like honestly? How tf can this not be fixed. Why is an integral part of the game literally broken.
---
Also, why cant apply my lever action skin to the Sole Survivor? Cmon Bethesda.
---
From a logistical standpoint, they're going to have to create code from the ground up to implement a shared stash or transfer system.  That's likely why they haven't released or even mentioned it yet.  Given that the player base demands a way to conveniently transfer items on an hourly basis, I'm sure they're well aware that it's something that players desperately want.
---
I feel confident they have people working on it, but it'll take some time to create, test and implement.  It has to be flawless, because players will absolutely lose their minds if their god-roll items vanish into the ether.
---
I really wish they had a test server that opened up periodically for at least a couple hours so that the player community as a whole could jump in and give them real world feedback.
---
Yeah probably. Worst thing is I'm lvl 45 and they were 109 and 48. Even in my power armor and with my fat man I barely made a dent in the 109 after hitting him dead on at least 4 times
---
There have been a few examples of expected top-notch games that fell pretty flat on release, but managed to become highly respectable over time.  I suspect that's what we're looking at here.  So far, the parts are adding up nicely compared to the initial release, and if they can keep adding interesting content while squashing bugs and keeping things running well, I think in the end FO76 will be looked on favorably by most people.
---
Except YouTubers, who can go #$(#* themselves for shilling their crappy opinions about how the sky is falling.
---
They're going to implement the instancing stuff they're working on for Vault raids.
---
This (and likely &gt;!Arkos Pharma!&lt;) are going to be uninstanced.
---
The douse your hands in napalm and light them ablaze! Your fists are no match for their firepower!
---
i woulld like to know this too :D
---
Haha psychic.....they‚Äôre bats.. sonar. Bats use sonar.
---
I mean I paid $80 for mine and gotten more than my fair share of fun. For $25, it's a steal. On top of that you get it after some of the annoying bugs and QoL improvements have been taken out and added, respectively.
---
As far as fun goes, there is a little something for everyone IMO. Is it all perfect? No. Are they working on it and improving it? Yes. 
---
Crafting, legendary hunting, loot hunting, building, RPing, helping others, griefing others, PvP, PvE, cosmetics, exploring, questing, and coming soon....raids, player vending, legendary character system, new quests, backpacks....you get the point. And that just takes us through May with two more FREE DLCs already announced by the end of the year.  Ohh and it's playable solo or in a group, your choice.
---
On top of all of this, the players who have stuck with this game have made up into the best online gaming community I have ever been a part of. Seriously, all jokes aside, go meet a stranger in the wasteland. It will probably make your day and take you on an adventure that will bring you right back here to tell us a story about.
---
Hi! Thanks for your reports, all. If you're encountering this, it would be a huge help if we could take at your account so that we can investigate the issue more thoroughly. Can those of you experiencing permanent freezing please share the following with me in a private message?:
---
* What is your primary platform?
---
* What is you Bethesda.net account name (or GamerTag)?
---
* What is the email address associated with your account?
---
* Does this happen with all your characters?
---
I get it, but really, who is showing up to the encryptid event with an inventory full of junk. Forgiving the occasional first-timer at this point, you *know* you're going to die.
---
Who is excited for re skinned enemies and the same old loot!!??
---
so no fixes for being unable to mod Power Armor and repairing items? Great
---
Absolutely.  I bought it for $35, and I consider that cheap for all the fun I've gotten out of it.
---
It basically plays like a more exploration-focused Fallout 4, without conversations, but with the unpredictability of other players.  Because the story is more of a background element, you are encouraged to bring your own creativity.  Who do you want your character to be?  What rules do they live by?  What do you want to do today?
---
Consider also that all the future roadmap DLC is *free*.  That includes a new questline every month or so.  A brand new main quest at the end of the year.  New game modes.  New dungeons and Vault raids.  You just get all of that for your $25.
---
OHHRAH!!! 
---
Toldly read this out loud and my roommates wanna buy Fallout now lmao
---
I bought mine for $20, and spent $25 in the Atomic Shop.
---
I've got 100 fun filled hours into it already. Compared to nearly every other form of paid entertainment? $0.50 an hour for enjoyment is seriously good return on the dollar spent.
---
I enjoy it more than FO4, to be honest (though FO4 was a bit of a dumpster fire).
---
It's not a replacement for a future single player (maybe Co-op if anyone at Beth is listening) story driven Fallout sequel... but it's not meant to be. This is the most fun I've had in a survival game, for sure.
---
Thanks for all of the input guys.  That was a lot easier than I thought.    Fusion generator hooked up and humming.
---

---
My experience says that it's exclusively CAMP only plans, Not weapons or Armour.
---
But which CAMP plans? I've only seen the small ones, no "Building Sets"
---
For 25$ you can explore the map and have a good time. Also the last patches where pretty good, so maybe were on a good way. I think the price is good.
---
I won't argue that point, either.  
---
I was thinking more on an international audience POV, from localizers that may not translate them well to player difficulty understanding stereotypical US redneck colloquialisms, etc.
---
They said they're balanced for two level 50 plus players so I imagine no
---
Got this same issue with power armour moding. Game doesnt aloow me to mod my helmets and legs for some reason. I have raised the ticket but response was so dull i could not believe.
---
Are you on PS4? I can add whatever mods you want.
---
It's just mats bro.  Chill tf out
---
I‚Äôm gonna hit it solo, because I truly believe it would be harder with friends, as companions give me away in any Bethesda game ever.
---
First I'd say Thank you Bethesda for this game, I really enjoy it. The game had ups  and downs since launch and they did some good work to turn some of it around. Let's be honest, to those who said it's not a finished product, would you rather wait for another half year to play the game, or start playing half year earlier and get involved in making changes to the game as they way you want it? Of course this game and Bethesda have a lot of room to improve, but I really appreciate the effort they put into it. 
---
As for improvement, I think one thing the Dev team can do easily is getting better at communicating fixes and changes released into patches, includes some 'minor' changes they tend to forget to mention in the path notes. Sometimes those changes are positive (i.e. Bringing back the inspect function when vendoring), but when those unexpected changes are making someone's gaming experience worse, you'll see a flood of blames and complains circling around. If they can be clear about the changes upfront, we can at least have some ideas what's going on.
---
Are you on xbox?  If so, my team and I will help you fix it.
---
Easily
---
Ohhh, that makes more sense! I hope they were also successful and that the new dungeon will be a great challenge with some great rewards!
---
But that would imply that they can‚Äôt find you in caves or buildings.  Which they do.  I know the game says they use sonar, but the reality is that also doesn‚Äôt fully explain their player sending behavior
---
I bring junk to the event sometimes. ESP if I'm far away when the event opens and I don't have time to visit a stash. BUT having said that I have enough scrap to not miss what I drop in the event. Not everyone knows they are going to die over and over at the event. I just think it's douchey behavior to farm other's junk at events. I know it's allowed, and I know it's part of the game and it's still shitty
---
Nah I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
That's probably true. I think uncle Charles was probably ostracized for other reasons. I asked my Dad, and he said that there were other longstanding problems.
---
Ah well I‚Äôm sure someone would provide modding services for you
---
This may be unpopular, but what about level capping players? 
---
I‚Äôve basically done that myself - I hit a certain level and then restart with a new LVL 1 and then run the lower level areas with a different build or strategy.
---
Eventually whatever character I have ‚Äúretires‚Äù and a new one is ‚Äúborn‚Äù.
---
I‚Äôd also be fine with enemies leveling dynamically according to player level. I do agree that running through the Forest at level 100 pretty much a bring waste (for me).
---
too bad you can't change your name to hannibal lector easily
---
Can you guys explain some of the rationale of keeping it non instanced? 
---
I have serious concerns about spawn camping happening here because of it.
---
I have been building PA waiting for the new skins to come out. Reactive plates for my T51, Kinetic dynamos for my excavator, and calibrated shocks for T60.....damn shame
---
Aww.
---
I was sceptical due to the shakey launch, but I game share with a friend on PS4, so a few weeks ago I got the opportunity to download it for free.
---
I've had a great time, but you sort of have to treat it a little different than traditional fallouts. There's themes of cooperation, fun outfits  and custom bases to show off, and interesting story elements told through subtle environmental aspects, and plenty of holotapes.
---
I was weary of the lack of NPC's, but after giving the new system a chance, I actually really like being able to listen to the story though holotapes, while also continuing looting or killing baddies. In addition, a lot of the holotapes sincerely captivated me. One I found yesterday, for example, was an audio clip of an old man who was retelling a story of when he first went out into the wastes after the bombs. He talked about how he planned on pursuing the, "every man for themselves," attitude, but he quickly wandered into a group of less-than-sanitary people who were eating a raw rat carcass. He told them that they should probably cook it first. They replied by saying that they tried, but still got sick. This led the man to a change of heart, and he mentions how from that day forward, he devoted his time to cooking and teaching people to cook in the wasteland.
---
The voice actor was great, and I genuinely enjoyed the story, even though the only thing I saw of this man was his skeleton.
---
Tldr: Yes
---
Eh, I can wait.
---
But when is it going to be active? I know where to go, just when it's ready.
---
Imagine if we could just agro Grahm instead. Shoot him and he turns all rage mode on you. I've seen that mutie fight, he can handle himself pretty dang well in a firefight. Have him respawn in 2 hours or something idk
---
First thing first:  Remove your \~\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76\\Fallout76Custom.ini - you'll need to read up on how to fix that to resolve the missing textures.  It may also help with other gameplay issues.
---
Why hasn‚Äôt it started yet?
---
As long as no one is torn between choices I think it could work. 
---
I personally would like events around defending a Faction‚Äôs HQ that rewards you based on the equipment you use, so for example defending the Responder HQ would award a handful of ammo for any guns in your inventory plus some food and drink, defending a BOS HQ could award Stimpacks, Ammo and a chance for the Battlecoat to drop? Being able to visit said HQs for Daily Quests revolving around the faction, vendors and as like a reward for reaching a certain ranking in each faction, a personal quarters. 
---
But number one priority I think is to make sure they work with the game and their respective factions (if aligned) before any desired functionality
---
I've gotten the brick set from a workshop I believe
---
The time has come, comrades! (Unless I was off by an hour, bite me). Pour through the enemy gates, show them what a dweller of 76 is capable of! Onwards! To victory! To fortune! TO THE TUNNELS!
---
Fire proof and bullet shield do, i use fireproof all the time, and a chum of mine swears up and down with bullet shield
---
I like it the way it is as you can take in the surrounding area, ambience in where you are sat. Then the camera rotates it‚Äôs cool.. leave as is
---
Torchlight II has a ‚Äúshared stash‚Äù that works similarly.
---
What bugs? I haven‚Äôt logged on in over a week.
---
It damn well better not.
---
At least we can hit the burrows people. I feel you all on the little problems but at least we have something new to do, something different.
---
Also thank you for the heads up hombre.
---
If they do put NPC's in I would like to see it as a rare random spawn. Like someone fighting a deathclaw or super mutant and such, but you dont see it very often.
---
Thankfully they were upfront about the delay, rather it be pushed back with minimal bugs then released and break the game.
---
And let's make sure we keep those vendor lists jumbled as can be!
---
Yep make them short and sweet and starts with a zero or something, because the default names are usually long, so your prized items will always stay on top. 
---
Alternatively you can also rename them all start with letter Z so that it takes extra effort to scroll all the way down to find them at the bottom, less chance to fatfinger them.
---
A few but the most important is not being able to apply mods to armor or weapons
---
Possibly harder to find simply because more people are farming them?
---
In suit spawns have been 25% for a couple of patches now.  
---
Those I find loose or in generators are anywhere from 50 to 99%.
---
Shit, that's 2316 caps right there.
---
&gt; defending some one that spawn kills
---
According to you. But then again, you're not smart enough to read rule 9.
---
I think I was actually off by an hour.
---
My left testicle we got hot fix tomorrow
---
A few folks have documented plan locations and origins. Created spreadsheets and stuff. Do a search and you‚Äôll find posts already dedicated to it. Focus on plan locations.
---
And if anyone has an AA+FFR one let me know..I'd love one
---
What if I told you: You're way too salty over a fucking video game?
---
I guess so, next patch not till May?  I'm going by a previous Bethesda reply... Patch 9.
---
One suggestion that I read and loved was splitting up the Aid tab.  Food and Chems would be awesome.  If we got a key-ring or way to hide all the cards we get, then putting them under Misc would be nice as well.
---
Or they had some really hungry party crashers.
---
It's only power armor I thought? I just modded 4 weapons and 5 armor pieces just fine.
---
Was hoping for a hotfix as well. A few weapons I can‚Äôt mod and the amount of server disconnects have been terrible since the patch.
---
If you don't want to fight the same enemies then you need not join us in battle, you may stay home and play Nuka Tapper, do not expect a share of the glory however!
---
Spoiled veggies has been my luck, except one time after Uranium Fever a level 50 bloodied gatling plasma dropped by someone
---
Cameras will be out in 1hour as atomic shop update?
---
What about the camera though? That was supposed to hit today?
---
Not til next update apparently
---
I thought they were pushing back the cameras?
---
&gt; The sad thing is the sheepsquatch event tells you everything you need to know on screen and everyone was still confused! Lol
---
so much this lmao. i avoided spoilers all week, decided to play through the quest last night. everything was pretty straightforward if you paid attention and actually soaked in the details. when you finally get to the event area, not only does the terminal explicitly explain what to do, but [Wolf even explains out loud what to do when you join the event.](/spoiler)
---
one of the biggest issues this game has had is the people that button mash their way through it. they don't actively listen to holotapes, npcs, or recordings. They don't read terminals, notes, or even the quest objectives. those people then turn around and go "THIS GAME SUCKS. ITS EMPTY. I DONT KNOW WHATS GOING ON. THERE IS NO STORY." etc. too many people go into the game expecting hand-holding or detailed cutscenes or something that paints the picture and throws it in your face without you having to think, then turn around and blame the game for them not playing correctly. i did a great majority of the actual quests and side quests solo because the people i would play with show up, click through all the prompts in the terminals as fast as possible to progress to the next step, or pick up holotapes and B line it for the next marker on the map without even listening to it, or complain about how they aren't killing something every moment.
---
I can't mod my robot armor right now unfortunately
---
They already said they pushed back the camera until later this month.  So stupid
---
How do you only scale players down, and then scale all enemies up? So a lvl 100 player is only as effective as a lvl10 in The Forest?
---
I wouldn't mind if it was exclusively for transferring weapons and armor. That way people couldn't just casually dump a bunch of valuable crafting materials, aid, and plans onto a fresh character to trivialize the early game.
---
They won't be atomic shop items, we'll have to a quest to craft one
---
I truly hate it that the game changes default action keys depending on what Perks you have enabled.  For instance, I have the Robot hacking Perk enabled to help with the Cryptid event, but normally don't.  So now when I'm running around selling stuff to robot vendors when I go up to sell I'm hacking it instead, and the sell becomes an entirely different button.  The hack feature should be the new button, the default sale button should remain.
---
Sounds pretty epic!
---
Just tried today yep it crashes game for me
---
Don't forget the busted spin up weapons.
---
The warehouse plan was literally the first plan I obtained from my first workshop in the forest.
---
And waste 20 minutes of the half hour allotted to tracking her down? I dunno about that one dawg
---
I just got to level 30 last night got a long way to go since I‚Äôve only been playing for 2 weeks now. Mainly playing survival for that constant 25-30% exp boost
---
That was driving me crazy! Thanks!  
---
I just found t[his page](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/7196356-perk-loadout-manager/page-64#entry68829081) on the Perk Loadout Manager Mod and it explains how to reduce maintenance costs on mods.
---
They must've planned dailies in advance and just plum forgot that noone can do them
---
I dont need permission to speak the truth dog get wrecked i got clips too
---
you‚Äôre awesome
---
It's just gonna be opened up, no need for an update/patch

I think it's just the pine box mods. Mods you craft can still be applied.
---
Mine is next to a cliff and can confirm:
---
* You don't ^^always get notifications if a monster is attacking your base.
---
* A single low level monster placed just right can slowly wipe out your whole base, one .38 bullet at a time. Level 14-16 scorched spawn on top of the cliff and peek over and shoot for hours at a time and my turrets often can't do anything about it.
---
Are you sure you have the full suit, all excavator pieces, equipped?  I'm 100% positive this works, I even bring out my excavator when just walking around if I see a couple ore nodes since its 4x the stuff.
---
I can make you a full set if you are missing anything and you are on XBox.
---
Is the dungeon still opening today?
---
Fucking bureaucratic neck beard over here
---
I've had nothing but bad experiences with Bethesda support. They seem to run it farmed out to a remote country with unskilled reps who regurgitate garbage knowledge base entries.
---
More instancing would to this well. Plenty of large buildings that could be instanced. Spawns scale to the first one that enters. WesTek does this, except it is a single instance everyone enters. 
---
Scatter these all across the lands. It is up to you to walk to them of pop in. I walk around a lot just because. It would be nice to be challenged, but it is also cool to be a walking god of death.
---
MERICA
---
This was mentioned in our [PAX East Panel](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/403037417?t=00h49m52s) a few weeks ago, but we're working on bringing instancing tech to the game for future content.
---
Developers stated on the Bethesda Forums there will be no update or server downtime. The Burrows will unlock in the same manner as Fasnacht.
---
Claptrap's Secret Stash, minion.
---
It will open up as new atomic shop content arrive in 50minutes
---
Like the mailbox idea, and they already had something similar in previous FO game (NV if I remember right), where you can send stuff home though a mailbox.
---
Or they could utilize the messenger bot or cargo bot, making you renting one from WS or crafting one-time use bots from workbench.
---
Gotcha! Glad I got my X01 decked literally before the maintenance the other day.
---
Wondering the same thing, they usually mention something on the load screen.
---
You play a dangerous game, my friend! When you come of age find me in the jungles northern edge and I'll gladly treat you to warm arms, cold water, and lemonade
---
Sort by New.
---
Here some sliver I love this speech
---
I really think is the other way around, they actually can take our junk but not our STIMPACKS!
---
Apparently no patch today, which in all honesty they need to have a patch, with all the bugs and crashing last weeks patch brought.
---
You humble me
---
Thanks for the answers. I'm thinking that maybe it has to do with the razer synapse app messing with controls. I've unplugged the razer and tried using my usual controller but holding down B just gives a delayed crouch. I've restarted the xbox but the problem is still there. Didn't know if it was just another 76 bugg.
---
Which Is why I only go in Survival with my Alt, after I've lowered my Caps right down, and Filled my Aid tab with some of the most worthless shite I can find.
---
And only if the Legendry is interesting, which has happened once so far.
---
I think we‚Äôve all accidentally shot a white springs robot, that damn moth man!
---
That's not what I was suggesting. Maybe I didn't use the best phrasing, I was trying to say that a change could be implemented that would leave sentinel and assassins legendary effects in the game but not BOTH on a single piece of gear.
---
That way players can still take advantage of gear bonuses but not be able to stack them in a way that completely mitigates all damage from other players.
---
The mobs are fixed the players are the variable.  
---
Done right the entire map is endgame without any strange spikes in difficulty (Like the Event from last week in a lvl 25-30 zone) 
---
If you want to see it in action (and done well) look to Guildwars2
---
Ign cel9brit
---
email I am not comfortable to post here
---
I only play with one character
---
i saw a increase only after survival mode went live, so I posted my experiences. What are you trying to discuss? Do you think the issue is unrelated to survival at all?
---
For reference I assume that time because that's when the Shear Terror event ends
---
"Glory" haha
---
Like "glory" from fighting the SBQ.
---
Click the link.
---
It would not be too hard to expand the forest to the west, and make it a 1-30 zone, and then scale the rest 30-50 with some "group" areas that are 70+ monsters. 
---
That way someone can solo if they want just fine, or group and get a bigger challenge by leaving your level zone as a team.
---
u/ladydevann why do we have camera challenges without the camera?
---
Maybe sort of maybe haha. You can‚Äôt take anything from anyone so there is no point, you gain nothing. You can try to make someone mad so they do dumb things but really all you can do is bother ppl and hope they lose caps. If survival was like Rust there would be raiders :)
---
Doubt my group will be on when I get home from work so most likely yea, solo it'll be lol
---
What's odd is that I've been running into legendaries in the most uncommon places lately. Yesterday I ran into 3 legendary mutants at Pleasant Valley Ski Resort. 2 of which were 3 star.
---
No update, so no mods working, wonky repair, and poor server performance. Par for the course from Bethesda.
---
I've had this at west-tec, one time on the way in, killed the 3 mutants by the back door and while I'm looting them 8-10 mutants spawn around me, born survivor earned its slot that time!  
---
Another was walking *back* through the initial barricades checking for any meat piles I'd missed and the entire camp respawns! Tried to run (over encumbered without my excavator), got to the entrance and got one shotted by some git camped waiting for me!
---
Nope, scheduled release was today for the camera.
---
That's before. Nowadays it's when a poor and desperate columbian swallows a large number of small packages.
---
I see my words have spread out to California, I thank you for gifting me my first medal, brother, and I hope to see you in the depths!
---
Fireproof is pretty essential in PA as you can't use a dense torso and those scorchbeasts do love their splodes.
---
Item for item trading should be in game. We shouldn't have to come up with workarounds for this. That's essentially what relying on subreddit blacklist systems, cap collateral, and middle man trading is trying to do.
---
Also, I haven‚Äôt played for three days, and when I logged on today, almost all containers were empty, including ammo boxes and safes.  That respawn time is just ridiculous!
---
Better than the sense of pride and accomplishment EA offers
---
I don't remember them saying they were pushing the camera back, roadmap said it is out today.
---
What if i told you you argument is invalid and you trying to grasp at straws to defend an exploit jn a game maybe you don‚Äôt value the devs time and that is why these issues occur because the titles are fast tracked through production or you beta testers or even general players at large ate too lzy to type anything up with your fat thumbs unless someone gives you an incentive for it but thats none of my business
---
Oh and btw youre still here on my theead so stay in line with the fucking op post you shit troll and be more constructive with your feedback 
---
People like you do not help the community what so ever
---
Or buffout. Whichever chem you prefer.
---
Ammosmith in agility super duper in luck
---
There are quite a few traders who specialise in ammo, especially 5.56. I have a few suppliers who sell me 2500 5.56 for 250 caps.
---
From a Critter attack maybe?
---
I was lucky today and i got an instigating war drum that hits 40% faster!
---
My camp is near alpha and my garage is almost on top of one of the clues for that side quest, so I moved it and added some barriers with rocket launcher support as there were 2 lvl 76 yao guai followed by a 3rd soon after.  I guess I'll eventually move, just such a nice little pond and the bears are almost convenient farms.
---
Theres already New Daily/Weekly Challenges in the Game which include the new Camera so it will probably come soon.
---
I wonder if the developers have crampy fingers a lot from crossing them so much every time they do an update.
---
It's still on the way! Player Vending needed a bit more testing time and we opted to delay it to Patch 9, which is currently slated for May 7. We'll have more Player Vending details to share with you in an Inside the Vault early next month.
---
I am doing it solo. Unless their are 2 sheepsquatch assaultrons in there it cannot be any worse than any other mob event
---
As well as being able to access the social menu, ext.
---
I play mainly solo. I‚Äôm definitely going to give it a try.
---
Harpers Ferry too.
---
I have ammo Smith what about luck?
---
For the time you took to make this pretty negative comment for no reason considering what Bethesda has said today.  you could have easily scrolled through the reddit and found the answer for yourself
---
Imma try to solo it too. Tanked out my set, and have good aid and a VE Gatling Plasma. If I could tank sheepsquatch, I can do this too.
---
No I don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not PSN messing up your game. It‚Äôs the social menu in game. You have to reduce the amount of people there.
---
I used to be a Doctor until I accidentally cannibalised someone as well, accidents happen.
---
Only if they weren't bugged.
---
Vendors or players?
---
Does it just \*open\* or do they have to do some sort of server maintenance first?
---
One of the new weekly challenges (worth another 30 atom) is also not completeable without the camera. Seriously makes you guys look like you have absolutely no idea what you're doing, Bethesda.
---
I didn't think you could get lung diseases from critters.

Irony at it's best.
---
I know I get no notice of the yao guai attacks, they generally only get a turret and some barricades before I get them.
---
Scorchbeasts also seem to love whatever flavor vault tec made our camp materials from
---
You‚Äôre both right in a way, I always wait a bit when I see a goodie bag, I mean if the event is over and your junk is important  to you you get it immediately. If no one shows up, it‚Äôs mine!
---
Might have to try this out. I've always used molotovs as my go to for health regen when fighting hordes with vampire weapons equipped
---
Nvm I see I've never noticed that one
---
Super duper gives a chance that anything you craft will double it. Also when you craft you can use perks in charisma so alcohol will increase your luck so super duper happens more often. Use x-cell, daytripper, luck bobbleheads, and armor armor that increases stats
---
I am.
---
I think the challenge will be getting the opportunity to try it solo. It's not instanced, so it'll be like any other location in the game world with the main difference that everyone and their dog will be there.
---
It would really suck if that person had the herbivore mutation and received no nutritional value  from it.
---
They've confirmed no downtime! All we must do is prepare for the assault and give them no mercy once the time comes!
---
I know this is going a bit overboard but.. if they did that, they could also sell a contraption the looks like a pip-boy and holds your phone.
---
I don't think the dungeon will be instanced, so I doubt I'll be able to play truly solo when I get in there. But I'm not planning on finding buddies to go in with.
---
How can I have brotherhood next to my name?
---
It's always possible it was monsters.  Maybe someone who didn't know better got mobbed by some mutants or scorched they couldn't handle and drew them to your camp.  Given enough time, even lvl 5 enemies can wreck your place pretty well.
---
Yesterday I left my camp for about 30 minutes to dig up some treasure map spots, came back and 75% of my camp was wrecked by a scorchbeast.  [I'm across the tracks from the Whitespring Station](https://imgur.com/hdi2WG1).  It's entirely possible some jackass lured it there to fuck up my house, but I think it's more likely the enemy just happened to spawn randomly.
---
I‚Äôve had 2 ideas for this.
---
1) A blue US postal mailbox just outside Vault 76. Lore - people wanted to send letters to vault 76 dwellers for when the vault opened, loved ones, etc that couldn‚Äôt get in. Function - Kind of like a shared Stash. Say, 200lb storage limit, even 100 would work. Shared stash means account stash, any character on a single account/gamer tag/PSN can deposit and withdraw and all characters see the same items. 
---
2) A blue US postal mail box that can be crafted at any level in a camp, no plans required, unlocked by default. Works the same way as above, but placeable in camps instead.
---
The camera is coming out today though, so we just got the challenges a little bit before the camera.  Not a huge deal.
---
No, cuz this is the reason we have no whiny little shitlings playing the game game. 80% of people I meet are adults. The rest are brag queens.
---
Lol you mad cause its true
---
Mentioned a few times already.
---
How tf do you guys get faction symbols next to your names, I want the brotherhood one
---
I had thought boxes were supposed to only have one or two, as I've never found one with more than that.
---
Either Nuclear Winter, or a new mode should try to solve the level scaling problem where half of the zones in the game are far too easy at end-game.  Perhaps a mode that only accepts high-levels so that places like the Forest, Toxic Valley, and Ash Heap can start scaling enemy levels to the degree that the Savage Divide, Mire, and Cranberry Bog too.  
---
And make high-level versions of low-level events as well, so more people actually do them.
---
More importantly, if we're going to start rewarding exploration, make legendary items have a chance to drop in certain reward tables, like as a rare thing in locked safes for example.
---
Yep, planning on soloing it later. Assuming I can find a server where people aren't already swarming the place.
---
Based on the assumption instances won't be here until the Vault Raids come out.
---
Definitely plan on a solo attempt!! Also gonna do it with my teammates later when they all get online, I'm sure
---
And is anyone surprised?  Honestly my faith in anything they do is fading fast.
---
darnit, I'm at work
---
Player vending.....Coming to the Atom Shop soon.
---
Responder it was a gift from President Kimball himself wear it with pride soldier
---
I'm going to be pretty upset if the camera doesn't come out today or if they don't adjust the dailies accordingly. I had 2 or 3 dailies for today alone that involved the camera that isn't out yet...
---
Does that mean it will be limited time event??
---
Haha its true weak up
---
You're gonna have to use your peepers and find 'em...
---
*Jeepers, creepers, where'd ya get them, peepers...*
---
Maybe you should consider some downtime. Two daily challenges and one weekly challenge (worth 50 atom total) can not be attempted without the camera, which isn't coming today unless something has changed.
---
Hello angain. Ran into you killing a Glowie. Nice Guy.Happy trails.
---
Will have to be solo, that‚Äôs the only way I play so I‚Äôm hoping 2x level 50+ is equal or equivalent to 1x person over level 100+ lol
---
You have been lucky then because they have always been around. Also yes its highly unrelated survival.
---
They are.
---
Nope, you must just test it :/
---
I'm perfectly aware. I was asking a question. They baked the Burrows into the game with the last update. I was wondering the same for the camera. Considering someone had a backpack quest pop up. Just a simple question.
---
My idea above was a 200 or even 100 lb shared stash. Not enough to hoard that much more, but enough to transfer needed items between characters.
---
Pretty much most of my caps go into 5.56. I just try to keep my eyes open for the good bulk deals. I have ammosmith and super duper too but that just wasn‚Äôt enough bullets for me.
---
Do you mean like Bloodied builds for damage? What other builds give similar damage really? I prefer power armour for general purpose: rad resist, carry weight, targeting computer, extra strength all in one
---
The player base would get pretty upset about people killing an already difficult to find vendor hahaha
---
God bless the Enclave
---
No. It‚Äôs just launched without downtime similar to how Fasnacht was launched.
---
If this was what just happened at Aaronholt Homestead, I showed up to kill whoever was wanted, it looked like someone was being griefed. My intentions were the best. Afternoon things seemed to settle down I left.
---
That's...not griefing your camp. That's just some random person who wanted to see inside your camp, you said no, dude picked the lock, he died to your turrets, came back to get his junk, and then tried to kill you to get it back. Then, when he couldn't kill you, brought his teammate along to help him out. That's not griefing, nor is it harassment
---
No why does everyone think itll be limited it would state if it was
---
Yeah.  I tried applying the mod a bunch of different ways the other day and no luck.  It‚Äôs definitely broken.
---
That's a good idea.
---
&gt;  I don't think you can favorite armor 
---
You can. And you can rename it as well.
---
So he broke a door and that was the extent of the damage, or what?
---
You got the exact same legendary effects?
---
You definitely can get sludge lung from critters, I've gotten it from wendigos a few times.
---
Though this does raise the question of SHOULD you be able to contract diseases through contact with diseased enemies even when you're in power armor.
---
I thought Super Duper was just a flat 10/20/30% increase, no luck involved.  That is what the card says at least.
---
But, but,but everyone was salivating for PvP in Fallout right?  I guess they still don‚Äôt understand their player base.
---
Wonder how many times people will ask what time it starts? Hey OP btw what time does it start haha.
---
When my luck is up it definitely increased yield
---
There's another 20 atom weekly for taking photos of creatures with the camera. So an unobtainable 50 in weeklies and 20 so far in dailies and if this is anything like when brewing was added there goes ~50% of our potential atoms for this week.
---
Anyone running a full troubleshooter armor set instead of PA? Is it the best option for this event ?
---
I use a couple troubleshooter weapons with good success but didn‚Äôt want to screw up the event by not using my PA. Also, using the jet pack to get out of the way of the sheepsquach has worked really well when it charges.
---
Upvoting all the posts that OP downvoted...
---
Learn to read, dude.
---
As well as Charred Scorchbeast Liver. +3 LCK on that.
---
Solo here.
---
You aren't outrunning that thing lemme tell ya
---
I'm on PS4
---
&gt;Considering someone had a backpack quest pop up
---
And? What does yet another bug have to do with the camera? That backpack quest has been around a long time, before it was "back pack quest" it was "sheepsquatches attacking your base" neither of which were actually the case. There was no sheepsquatch attack on any bases, and the backpack quest doesn't exist in game.
---
Answer my question with another question? Go make a post about it ya rugrat
---
purple headlamp here.
---
Pretty sure they said it was instanced.
---
Sounded like a random who wanted to see inside OP's camp, but OP didn't want to let them inside, so they decided to say fuck it and picked the lock. I've done the same before when I wanted to check out someone's camp, not that big of a deal, in my opinion
---
Thank you
---
&gt;Men, women, survivors. In 1 hour and 35 minutes as of this sentence

**Fuck I can't keep waiting like this**
---
No, The Burrows will be a permanent addition to the game. You may complete the related quest once (Started by finding Scribes corpse in the sewer) but may repeat the dungeon multiple times.
---
Yep, it's one of my go-to weapons. I'm just hoping to get a +Swing Speed one on the market at some point now.
---
Why are you being instigating? Stop acting like a child.
---
I know that, but how the hell do we get them? Think maybe just finding one out there in the world
---
I live for battles like these in this game. One reason why I like to take regular walks from Watoga to Harpers Ferry. Awesome rush.
---
Ugh I knew I was forgetting something and my gatling plasma is such utter crap now cause of that.
---
Yes, start randomly shooting high level players standing around after the Sheepsquatch event. Let's see how long your Wanted status lasts.
---
Noone really lose anything in this game so... it sounded like a funny an very rare player interaction. :x
---
Thanks much
---
Didn't even do that, all he did was pick the lock on said door, which immediately made him wanted, so he died to OP's turrets
---
What level tier is the dungeon?
---
No Camera for the challenges either:  
---
[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/DuVsChK.png)
---
This 100%. All the dude wanted was to see your camp.
---
Ooo that‚Äôs not good. Instance like a Wes Tek aka
---
Open to the entire server.  I was hoping instance like an old wow dungeon just to you or your party.  It‚Äôs gonna be a brutal few weeks in there lol.
---
I noticed I also couldn't attach a mod I owned earlier, is that a bug right now?
---
Also weekly challenges. I guess they just forgot to change them?
---
oversight
---
happened to me a few days ago also on PS4, some nerdneck tried to trade me and I just ignored them, they destroyed my water purifier and I just killed them and left the server. I just feel like they're too afraid to go to survival or something so they try to bully people in adventure mode. Just kill them a few times and server hop.
---
That's anecdotal. You're just having good luck, the RNG loot table is the same regardless.
---
Switch weapon types also. I swap in 2* scrounger and 1* pharma farmer in LCK while I'm farming in PvE. You'd be surprised how fast you can accumulate.
---
Is it out now?
---
Happy to help!
---
Yeah, that's always kinda irked me, but I figure it would be more OP than it already is if PA protected you from all diseases. Still, sludge lung is one of those things they tell you to wear a gas mask to prevent, so it comes as a real surprise to me that critters can give it to you. I think I had recently fought a wendigo, too, now that I think about it.
---
Typical, LOL.
---
I guess my interpretation of of people using alts or 2nd characters was just a way to bypass the stash limits, which in a way it is, but I didn't realize that increasing the stash size has an impact on the server quality, but it makes sense, in the same as not leaving bases in the world and stuff like that. I have a 2nd character too, but like a lot of people I play by myself so I don't have a trustworthy way to transfer stuff so I usually just scrap it, or dump it or sell it. I was hoping they'd increase the stash limits again at some point but if it's causing too many issues I don't see that happening, so I might have to utilize my alt as well, which then I'd be all for a quicker easier way to transfer stuff between the two.
---
What does that relate to this?
---
We will look death in the eye, and we will punch him in it! We will fight through the nails in our own coffins, and we will push back with such ferocity the doors of the TNT domes will be thrust open and their bounty shared to all!
---
Lol you still look dumb for trying to gaslight me... kiddo
---
What effects? Like 2 or 3 star legendaries?
---
It's good for stealth and so you don't expect t to take too much damage, like you said. Also weighs very little so it can be carried with you all the time
---
Alright Lorax.
---
Probably at 11 when the Shear Terror event ends
---
Useful tip: if you get Masstagger, you can see the raging asshats before you engage them.
---
YOU ALL GONNA DIE
---
and it's going to be awesome
---
It's not instanced, the community managers confirmed that.
---
OK thanks for the advice I'll give it a try.
---
Where is the entrance?
---
I'm not, I'm just answering your question. If you don't like the answer to the questions you ask, then don't ask the question...
---
Thanks I'll look again. Are they in the street or not ? Lol just wondering if I have to look else where. They are only in the street around where I live
---
And that's *if* my assumption's correct, there could be five minutes between Shear Terror ending and the Burrows opening, just keep your pants on for a while longer
---
I was mad at the feed the people event change. Correction I am still mad about that change.
---
OP said he either picked or destroyed it, didn't actually go into detail. Which makes me think OP is the "He touched my in-game things! He's harassing me!"
---
Same to me. But I cannot use stealth boy (incl. SB mk3 &amp; Phantom SB) that were created/picked before latest patch.
---
That's not griefing it's part of the game and the player is probably not on this sub.
---
Not doubting you but can you guide where to find that, would just like to read it
---
yeah, for once i have to agree :/
---
This is major game breaking..
---
I wounder, if the released a update and our characters was missing both arms, would they fix it the day after or like now, just wait a few weeks ?
---
This bug is almost that bad :(
---
Sweet ü§òüèæ
---
It's not instanced as per the community managers. Stop down voting this guy!

I have gone to the Reddit of the casuals to get them awoken for this battle, all of this community, all of the fandom itself will rise on this day and claw through the depths! Only 34 minutes! (Probably)
---
No update, new things in 30 minutes
---
Calm down there Night King.
---
Yup - since last week's patch.  Its actually a pretty terrible patch that broke some very basic things.  One step forward, three steps back.
---
This isn‚Äôt harassment. This is the game. It‚Äôs the apocalypse, he wanted shelter, you said no (which is your right), and they broke in. Then, he sought revenge for his death.
---
Harassment is when these prepubescent kids msg you with death threats and talk about raping your mother because you took their workshop.
---
With all the block features in the game and on PSN, reporting someone to bethesda for ‚Äúharassment‚Äù at all seems crazy to me. 
---
Block them and when you see them take a workshop end them. That is how the world works after the apocalypse and is much more sportsman like.
---
Bad communication from Bethesda, surely not.....
---
Dude, this subreddit is about the video game Fallout 76. Save your confessions for r/longpig
---
OH, I misread then. I mean if OP's door was still there when he got back to his camp, then the random picked the lock. Also, yes, very much that guy haha
---
Oh wait. Misread. I'm going off how long before Shear Terror's event ends
---
*Mashes all of them*
---
"It looks like a Christmas Tree"
---
Commenting so I remember this post. I admin a exactly what you are looking for. Will message you later.
---
Holy hate üòÇüòÇ y‚Äôall are wack üôè good to see the community is helpful...
---
You're aussie or kiwi aren't you lol
---
I wrote a paragraph about why it isn't my game, why do you have to repeat that to me (It's alright)? You got to understand that many people are passionate about this series and were excited when they found out they might not have to wait years for the next game only to be disappointed when they found out it was a multiplayer spinoff.
---
50+, it's in the Mire so there may be a few 91 Deathclaws.
---
Answering someones question is being a raging asshole? ROFL
---
There is an updated roadmap, they‚Äôve already done one, here‚Äôs a screenshot: https://imgur.com/gallery/HV9SheL hope that helps
---
Bingo. It's gonna be a clusterfuck for a few days. I'll run it sometime this weekend.
---
Killed her Twice last night pretty fast. I‚Äôm pretty sure she didn‚Äôt regenerate health each time either.
---
Bloodied unyielding radrage etc. The unyielding armor pieces stacked 5 deep give 15 strength. That's 75% bonus melee damage. If you're a melee build then your strength is higher than the PA strength assist, so the +2 strength from motion assist servos is all you get, and that's a very important mod slot for most builds, so motion assist may not be your best use of that mod slot. 
---
In addition, PA gives a large nerf to your speed, drains AP faster, and AP doesn't Regen as fast. As a melee character being slowed down is a big nope for PVP.
---
Using PA reduces your damage by minimum 65% for bloodied unyielding radrage builds, speed across the board, your sprinting ability, etc.
---
In PVP, it doesn't even compare to unyielding pieces, AP refresh pieces, sentinel/cavalier pieces, etc. No contest. 
---
Then there's the fact that using vats, sprinting, etc, all consume fusion cores rapidly. Farming them isn't difficult, but it does take you out of play to go collect more.
---
\*peers at daily challenges\*  
---
That's an awful lot of camera stuff.
---
Yep, I've mentioned this a few times but never got any response. The game needs a new game + mode or something desperately.
---
50+ you can solo but they say you better be prepared
---
Is that why my laser gat fires just one shot when reloaded?  It's been screwing me up bad.
---
Vampire shotguns are OP. They heal per pellet and theres 7. You get like 20% hp per shot.
---
You are the real MVP. LOL. Thank you!
---
If it's not instanced I can imagine 15 high level players like in SBQ fight but in tiny cramped tunnel :)
---
A new location that is not instanced? Good luck trying to solo it for at least a couple days.
---
you spelled "didn't care" wrong.
---
&gt; he wanted to see inside my CAMP, to which I said No.
---
I don't condone PvP without consent, but I really don't understand why people lock their door and say no, it's not like anything can be stolen.
---
Rifle perks affect it.
---
Going it alone unless something forces my hand, for sure.
---
Hunting rifles tend to miss a lot, and if they don't miss, they hit the enemy in a slope so damage is reduced. I get this with Watoga robots a lot: a perpendicular chest hit does full damage and an angled or side-hit does half damage; all point blank range.
---
Just input bravo code twice. Both failed.
---
Perfect, thank you! All I wanted to know :)
---
Good luck, Bethesda said it's not instanced. So there will be a shit ton of people down there.
---
Lol okay white psycho.
---
She regenerates health because its a legendary enemy i guess
---
God damnit! Maybe we gotta break into a museum of old cameras and use them!
---
Have they confirmed this anywhere? I‚Äôve seen it rumored around the sub, but I think the Fasnact event wasn‚Äôt live until around 3pm EST it so?
---
We we get it, they forgot to take out the camera challenges. It's an oversight, oh well.
---
Likely it was more than one griefer with explosive weapons as per usual so even if the game alerted you with big red letters and a siren, you would have just been killed when you went over there after trying to stop them and they would have just destroyed it in front of you.
---
It's cool that you're helping out new players so don't let one or two guys ruin that for you. You've more than likely helped tonnes of new players with that camp so don't let one negative experience outweigh all the positive.
---
People post thanks threads all the time. I appreciate that things are getting better, but they're *doing their jobs*. If they had just left the game a fucky mess, it would have destroyed whatever goodwill still exists with all but the most obsessive fans. They need to make the game better, if not to make up sales at some point, to build up their reputation going forward. I think they're going in the right direction (although the repair kit/workbench bug issue is more than a bit worrying), and I hope it continues.
---
But they always run away scared or just simply don't see the damn paper bag you're shooting at ...
---
So does Path of exile, diablo 3, and pretty much every other online "looter" game does. The fact they thought they wouldn't need it for this game is just ridiculous.
---
With my level 29 who has almost no ammo because of the Encryptid event, I am nowhere near being prepared.
---
Now THIS is just the random throwing a hissy fit cause you wouldn't trade with them. Destroying someone's camp or something in their camp cause they wouldn't trade with you is just childish
---
Camera isn't fully implemented yet so both dailies and challenges can't be completed at all until it's implemented in a later patch.
---
Lost my T-51 arms.  Fortunately, I was able to replace them in about an hour of server hopping.
---
Depends on which barrel type you put on it. It has semi-auto, auto, and shotgun options, so only the related perk would affect each, not all 3.
---
So, it's been a while, and I grabbed a set of wood armor. You're right. It is great for stealth.
---
It doesn't come in 2 or 3-star variants, but it's still amazing at keeping me hidden. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
Yes! I have. Only a level 73 and it's the only sbq event I've seen so far. I joined and there must have been another 16 players there. I'm glass cannon bloddied/unyielding/bolstering build with melee.
---
You know...melee is one of the most effective things against her when she's grounded. Her explosive and ballistic resistance is insane. I've noticed mini nukes do nothing. I've noticed melee on ground has entirely been the most helpful. Especially when everyone is using melee. Each time she landed we melted half a bar of health. 
---
But you still need the shooters to focus her in the air, while you take out the side enemies with melee.
---
There was also a person who build a temp camp with like 8 missile turrets and that was nice. 
---
I think numbers are what matter here. That's all.
---
You need a gross amount of high level players. And maybe a few lower level to be cannon fodder
---
That's a really cool story :) I've enjoyed helping people too.  I quite like welcoming people to my CAMP behind the Flatwoods church, so they can use all the crafting machines close to the vendor in the church.  It's a neat little community service and I always enjoy seeing people make use of it.
---
&gt; I have purchased every Bethesda game including wet(look it up, it... wasn't great), rage and other games I had no interest in just to support my favorite developer. 
---
You don't have to buy games you aren't into to support a developer =/ Especially one of the big players like Bethesda.  It sort of troubles me a bit that you do, heh.  Just buy the games you want man, the companies will keep producing the good stuff.
---
Yeah that's cool. I am talking about the people who grab it immediately, while I'm like kneeling in FFYL because I'm a conduit-- or those who show up just to farm people's loot. Sometimes I die as the Ss is killed and I get sent to respawn, come back and see my loot still there and it's only got like half of what was in it when I dropped it. I mean, people are treating the event like a Sm√∂rg√•sbord
---
COME BROTHER, LINK YOUR ARMS WITH ME IN SHOW OF STRENGTH LET US BOTH CHARGE DOWN INTO THE DEPTHS OF HELL AND SLAY WHATEVER MAY AWAIT US BELOW
---
AD VICTORIUM
---
FOR THE BROTHERHOOD
---
Such are Bethesda patches, atleast they seem to be getting better at the ratio of new content/fixes to new bugs developing
---
How is that any different from now?
---
Borderlands did this very well.
---
I found that I have better chances at a new server if I wait 20 or so seconds at the title screen
---
Cool, but just so you know, these were posted on NukaCrypt as each one was solved, between 5 PM and roughly 6:30 PM Pacific last night. If you're looking for the launch codes on the night of the reset, NukaCrypt is always the best source.
---
If you've got the rifle barrel, then the Rfileman perks. If its got the auto barrel, then the commando perks. If its got the shotgun barrel, shotgunner perks!
---
don't forget friend list and camp clipping walls/floors XD
---
Yet we can't figure out how to hold a flipping tambourine in a mech suit that we also built.
---
Wow I got a Bethesda reply
---
Chill bro, just spoke to Todd and he‚Äôs like totes on it.
---
From what I can gather the turn over in the atom shop is in 25 minutes so maybe that's when it will drop
---
Gawd dammit. Welp there goes a good 70 atoms...
---
Eh look for a lvl 100+ melee build user I'm sure they can cheese it for yas
---
Lmao üòÇ
---
They work on American time do they not?
---
Im going to try solo.. packing plenty of stims and chems
---
Ah, got it.
---
So, at lvl 99, if I head back to the lumber yard for wood scraps, I do damage like a lvl 3 player with maxed rifleman perks, with a TSE combat rifle that outputs level 1 pipe pistol damage, on the level 1 ticks?
---
What time do burrows open?!
---
A mode where everything is level 50 minimum and all drops are level 50 would be incredible.
---
Offended much? It's the truth. Either I meet people, or I'm meeting people who brag about who's got the best build.
---
The sheep thing has a channeled melee attack that rips you a new one. I noticed if your tanking the sheepthing and jump up and down with marsupial you can dodge any one shot mechanics and reduce the fire DoT damage occuring around the sheepthing.
---
Most of us assumed when we heard instanced we thought old school wow dungeons.  Although a Wes tek setup is still technically instanced as its off the world map.  I‚Äôm definitely bummed out by this.
---
With; it helps tame the iron taste.
---
I just say make stash 2K and shared by account
---
One of them's by the Harpers Ferry armory and I forgot where the second is
---
Definitely solo. I'm a sneak sniper, every single end game event doesn't work in my favour as mobs are always agro from people around so my perks can't do my best dmg output and I'm not built for defence like other people. I've extremely been looking forward to some end game content I can do solo as my character is built to play.
---
Good thing is the lag sometimes causes double legendary drops. Ill take that over not repairing my grog axe to 200%.
---
I'm confused. You finished the game, and you are complaining that you finished the game? This is when you move on and start playing a different game. I've put &gt;300 hours into Appalachia, and that's more than enough. Now, I play other games and when new content is added to FO76 (like the Sheepsquatch missions, and the Burrows to come), I hop on and play them. I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with the game, I think people just fucking freebase it and then have trouble letting go.
---
I told you then and I'll tell you again - your test is not for the anti-armor legendary, you tested two variations of a TS per your notes there, one with and one without an AP mod.  Stop spreading bad information and invalid tests.
---
I spent all of yesterday hoarding ammunition and repairing gear
---
Things need to be addressed and waiting weeks for a patch, let alone a hotfix is not making me a happy customer
---
I've found him multiple times. He just trods over to me in the cranberry bog, shouting "Wait! Hold it!" and then when he gets to me he just stands there doing nothing. I usually just shoot him in the face after that.
---
WE WILL CHARGE THROUGH THE GATES OF HELL  
---
AS WE MAKE OUR WAY TO HEAVEN  
---
***THROUGH THE NAZI LINE***
---
Perfect for survival!!
---
How do you delay a feature and forget to delay the accompanied challenges?  This studio is wonky, to put it nicely.
---
I understand where you're coming from. The whole world is so beautiful, but it feels so empty at the same time. I can walk for an hour and not encounter - anything. That tells me something is missing..
---
I use a Tesla Rifle with auto barrel.  Damage scales with Commando perks.  Does anyone know if Ground Pounder and Long Shot work with it as well?  I don't feel I have a faster reload with Ground Pounder and when I use the Long Shot perk, it doesn't actually affect my range even though my gun is sighted.
---
Proof?
---
&gt;Did you not see the rude response you gave me to start? With the snappy retorts? Sorry, but someone who initiates a conversation with "ROFL you sweet summer child" sounds condescending right out of the gate. The dismissive tone with your responses is just fuming with arrogance.
---
Yeah that isn't being rude or arrogant, that is a turn of phrase that just means, "oh geeze did you not know about this?"
---
&gt;Regardless, what you provided wasn't an answer. It held nothing pertaining to my question.
---
Yes it did answer your question... Look at bethesda's past actions with this game, and the fact there is no patch today. Do you honestly think they are going to somehow add the camera to the game without a patch or any downtime? They have already said numerous times they can't hotfix the servers, so any changes they make REQUIRE down time. 
---
So the fact that this thread clearly states that Beth has said there will be no downtime answers your question.
---
&gt;I don't care what they've done. I'm curious if there was anything said about what IS happening NOW.
---
Nothing is happening now because as I pointed out above, they can't make changes without taking the servers offline. So that answers all those question. Absolutely nothing is changing right now, and won't change until at the earliest next tuesday.
---
Wait sheer terror was limited time only ?
---
.... uuhh wrong army... see yas.
---
Yeah the keys are irrelevant though. I mostly want easy access to my chems not easy access to the magazines and bobbleheads. Lol That's a good idea but also complicates the menu even more. Maybe with the organize button they can add chems bobbles magazines and food instead of weight and value!
---
  I had a regular low level wardrum some time ago.  The sound on hit amused me.... but even with increased swing perks, it became too slow when I started regularly farming WS and roaming the east side of the divide, so I gave it away.
---
  I'm a 1 hand melee build, martial arts 3 and incisor 3, and have other weapons that, at least for the moment, are working better for me than the higher damage, but slower, 2 hand weapons.
---
Picked up a high level legendary war drum during one of my runs..seems like at least 3 weeks ago...but have never used it - stashed is soon as I got back inside the resort.   
---
That said, yes, I beleive it has the same spec.
---
Wait the update releases in 30 minutes? Well I can‚Äôt wait! I run a BOS clan and we must search this place for our members died there! (Lol I‚Äôm bored so I decided to use the last sent)
---
My vampires tesla procs every time it arcs to a new enemy
---
Haven't had any issues downing the SBQ after or before patch 8.
---
Cant argue with that. I quit Anthem to come back to 76. At least 76 is fun.
---
This forum is literally filled with people asking the same questions over and over because they are to lazy to do a search. Or to lazy to keep themselves updated.
---
More so, when you answer someone's question about when or what, someone else will come along and call you a liar, and then when you provide an actual link, make up some excuse.
---
Literally someone a few days ago asked someone to provide a link to a map showing where all the treasure map locations are.
---
If they had typed that same question into google, they would have gotten the answer.
---
Lazy is asking what time it is, when there's a clock right in front of you. And that's what so many of these questions are. Lazy because the answer is there. They just don't want to have to click a button to go to google or search the forums. 
---
SO YES. IT's LAZY.
---
Killed her well over 30 times in the past two weeks, but everything depends on how frequent she lands and how long she‚Äôs on the ground, I‚Äôm a tank with a nice 3* 50 cal so I just jump right In front and let her hit me while everyone melee‚Äôs the sh*t out of her. But if she‚Äôs airborne your gonna need a team of guys who got TSE 50 cals or miniguns, Gatling and so on.
---
You sound like an old Milhouse. Not a single person in game since beta has bragged to me about their build. Idk maybe your goofy username bring in the trash.
---
Paddle Ball
---
With literally any of the effects it was supposed to have.
---
No, the stuff in the Atomic Shop is
---
so no patch to fix the stuff you broke last patch?
---
Yeah I‚Äôve noticed something g like that too, it almost feels like a shotgun
---
Yes. Servers have been atrocious since the last patch.
---
Used it last night as well without any issues.
---
Idk but i mainly use it to eat some people during the Sheepsquatch Event.
---
They released it a while back
---
I guess I'd be fine with something like transient NPCs, passing through or perhaps a BOS or enclave operative in the area to accomplish some goal, but I'm not sure I want towns full of NPCs either
---
It says in a private message, my mans.
---
Damnit.  Finally got the jet pack, targeting HUD, and calibrated shocks for my Nuka Quantum X-01 and I still can‚Äôt use them!
---
Yes, it was discouraging to read.
---
Not yet. A mod commented on the Bethesda forums that there wouldn't be any downtime and that it will be going live "a little later today" that was about an hour ago.
---
Good luck.
---
It's not instanced, so odds are you won't be able to solo it for a while.
---
I keep hearing B&amp;C drops great loot, but I've yet to get anything decent.
---
Most likely I will do it solo. I've got a group to do it with but I like to take my time and read / listen to everything and don't want to be rushed by others flying through the content.
---
Yes. Always happens. 
---
Every time I load, I run down the steps to see how far I can get before the server rubberbands me back to the entrance. I never make it past the vendor doc.
---
Exactly my reason... Foundation is there... Build on it.
---
Well someone has to keep the surface safe for us! Your duty will not be forgotten
---

I really love it that when people can‚Äôt argue with OP‚Äôs point they try to derail it.
---
Just noticed that and took action thanks!
---
Solo because everything dies so fast no one would have fun watching me one shot everything in a tunnel with a sledge.
---
Thank you so much!!! This is why I posted in here for the knowledge of my superior vault dwellers. üòä happy hunting when they do go live! ü§ôüèº
---
I look at my weapons and armor as trophies so why should I have them nerfed, don't make my bullets softer make the game harder.
---
Does seem a bit shady though. This is the thing that involves real world money. They will be adding new things to the shop and handicap the ability to get points. Chances are every day this week will be similar with the challenges, like it was with the alcohol related challenges. It's also worth mentioning the many glitches still in the day 1 challenges that are unattainable.
---
I think the Fachnacht parade event started around 2:30-3pm eastern time. I have a feeling this will be the same.
---
And as predicted this gets unpinned without fanfare, and without response from Bethesda, in the hopes that it will quietly fade away. I presume you guys are still locking and removing stand-alone posts on the subject? If Bethesda isn't cutting you a check for all this work, you're getting ripped off.
---
The open world dungeon, horrible mistake in my opinion.
---
I have to assume that BGS will look at my account, the hours played, look at the junk I've accumulated, the ratios of things I've farmed, my time spent in areas etc., and be able to deduce that I'm just a hardcore player that likes to find the best ways to do things and plays efficiently.
---
If not? If I'm banned over legit crafting? Then at least I'll know that they have no idea what they are doing, and I'll be asking for a refund, and never buy another BGS game ever again. Already almost to that point over their shady monetization in Blades.
---
The dungeon is not instances? That's dumb
---

With an instigating lever rifle, you can pretty much 1 shot everything in the torso if you sneak. Except scorch beasts.
---
Yeah all games on this engines uses doors (objects) as teleport. So if there are no doors, you cant teleport inside :D
---
What is it?
---
You're clearly not understanding.
---
They said there is no update or downtime today. No servers going out. It's literally in the post. They baked the content into the game update last patch. They're just unlocking it which is exactly what they said to everyone. It is most definitely possible to make server changes to adjust content on the fly. It is done with plenty of games. Especially access to content when unlocked and ready.
---
So if The Burrows is there already.. And they're not taking down the servers, and literally said unlocking it without any downtime.. Then tell me, how is it so impossible they included it with the last update?
---
Sorry, but you have a loose understanding of how operating a game works. You can hotfix without a patch or taking things down. You can also streamline content adjustments without downtime. If it doesn't require a client side update, then there is no patch and no downtime necessarily to ensure client and server continuity. Now, that's not saying some hot fixes won't require an outage. But in this case they've specifically said it doesn't.
---
As much as Anthem is bad, they do this constantly. They've changed Dynamic Events, Weather, Availability of Mob spawns, Loot all without downtime. All without impacting anyone's session.
---
So yes, my thoughts are perfectly valid. I've seen it plenty in the 20 years I've been playing MMOs or MMO Lites.
---
You're here... complaining that endgame is dull. That you're too owverpwoered, and that the game difficulty should be ramped up to meet the demands of the players who make every game into a number-crunching metagame.
---
Pointless and silly, indeed.
---
It's a roleplaying survival game. try playing a role, other than "aspiring demigod", and the game remains challenging. Call it silly and pointless if you wish.
---
Take it easy, Sally.
---
Higher level enemies, invent new enemies, new hazards and so on.
---
Yes!
---
It's a bummer for sure
---
Xbox :). I can play on PC too but most of my friends are Xbox and that's what I prefer. My poor little pc just doesn't have enough OMMFF to it. Xd
---
That‚Äôs like... why I posted this post man.
---
Come on man do you really think she has anything to do with what challenges there are, or when they decide to add new features?
---
Lol!
---
I use it to save inventory space. No need to cook, no need to carry food.
---
What time exactly is ‚Äúa little later today‚Äù?
---
Is the camera quest going to be added alongside the burrows?
---
Nice try, ISIS
---
Oh, the horror.
---
And two of the Week long challenges aswell...
---
A conduit?

---
Scroll down a bit.. a bit more.. and.. BOOM! You will see Fat *"The Guarantee"* Man came out for this week.
---
It will be nice to do hard content without a bunch of people standing around and leeching loot.
---
Oh...sounded like you were saying it was too difficult and you don't have a lot of time to complete it.
---
No worries lol. I'll hit it this weekend, once all the clamor has died down. Give em hell down there!
---
I don‚Äôt think it really matters to me, but I don‚Äôt see how it would hurt?
---
Yeah I will try it out. Just dont think it will be anything more than reskinned ghouls that are bullet sponges with littme reward. The weapon variety in this game is prettt boring.
---
Already got my monies worth though so I will take any free content.
---
I made a new one, and dinged 50 last night just before bed. All the legendaries are now mine!
---
Seriously. I made this toon designed around full sets of legendaries I had gathered from my main. Undead Radsniper. Bloodied weapon and full set of bolstered Marine armor. Rad Sponge, Ghoulish, all the sniper perks. Surprisingly hard to kill even when health is down to a sliver. Good damage overall, deadly when the crowd gets personal.
---
I agree with you. I've just been looking at this pattern where I get off work early on 'New Content / Update Tuesdays'; I Look at the Bethesda Twitter, I'm looking forward to some new content and am always none the wiser, with no clear indication of what / when to expect.
---
Don't get me wrong I'm not expecting a '100% gets released at that time' type of post, if 'games as a live service' have taught me anything it is to manage my expectations.
---
Their must be a lot of red-tape with regards to posts at Bethesda, because I have seen many individual people releasing a product that are much better at communicating on that important day.
---
To me it just feels weird every time it happens, literally I just think it's strange, spooky...
---
yeah its happening to me too on ps4 unfortunately
---
That's not true. A new player at level 50 doesn't have the perks or the legendary armor and weapons that a level 400 has, no chance in survival. A high level player starting a new character is different but until level 60 or 70 doesn't have the build finished.
---
I've made it to artisans corner before lol
---
And what about Harpers Ferry?
---
But Mothman...
---
Shame, I'm on PS4. I was gonna ask about helping you get the codes.
---
Thank you so much for taking the time to do this though. I will pit the codes to good use.
---
&gt; it's the sort of thing a child would do when they don't get their way. 
---
OH THE IRONING
---
at work rn,
---
the challenges have to do with the new camera? like they cant be done with photomode?
---
Do want, prefer the suit look over the armored tank
---
Hey awesome, thank you.
---
"I solved bravos last week for nukacrypt." Um, I personally know the person who solved Bravo last week for NukaCrypt, and it wasn't you LOL.
---
I can easily walk out with 500 scrap wearing excavator armor.

Patch 9 was never scheduled for today everyone.  Everyone's getting confused with the Burrows and Patch 9.  The Burrows dungeon that's coming out isn't part of Patch 9.  They are 2 separate things.
---
Unfortunately, this has happened to almost everyone at one time or another, myself included.  I know that you feel devastated emotionally from this.  Now that you have vented about it , I would council you to step back, take a breath and start anew.  It is conceivable that in game creatures did this, but highly unlikely.  The people who do this type of griefing, I like to call them "little Billy Bastards" only really win if they grief you completely out of the game.  They don't or can't care and probably only did it to rack up a bounty to bait someone to farm caps.  It was just your bad luck they came across yours and not someone else's.  You know this.  Be a Phoenix sir!  Rise from the ashes and reclaim your home!  Others are willing to help if you need it.  That's the true strength of this games community.  I strongly doubt that you are as whipped down as you feel right now.  Give it some time then jump back in.  Fo76 needs survivors.  That's what is all about.
---
I agree with being nice.
---
However i am not thanking them for Fallout 3.5
---
No matter how many brain cells i lose, the entire concept of Fo76 was handled poorly and should be a shining example of what not to do if you plan on keeping your reputation.
---
Why do you bring junk there knowing full well that is what happens? First thing I do scrap the junk and toss it in the stash.
---
That just meant The Burrows is intended to be bal...

Whatever the reason dog, its not a good site to try to life at. It could be a mating zone indigenous to that area. Whatever the reason, I don't think Beth is gonna change it with the new content and patches coming out
---
Just ran up and down the street by the armory over and over. Unless it's under a car it's not on my map
---
That's great, unfortunately I met some ultra braggers. People bragging all day and night. Starting a conversation like 
---
"have you lunched a nuke Psycho?"
---
"no"
---
"oh I have lunched more than 100, I am launching one right now"
---
"ok"
---
"yeah yeah, even if you launch, you'll never do it as fast as me"
---
"I know"
---
"yeah yeah I found a trick and I launch a nuke in 3 minutes, that's right"
---
Then there are the ones who talk about their bloodied weapons all the time. "It does X amounts of dmg, oh yeah and if I'm below 30% hp, it does X amounts". There is no way you haven't met people who keep talking about this. Not saying it's bad, I just find that younger people play the game this way, and adults(26+) play differently, more chill.
---
Also what's wrong with my name? Why are you offended by it, or why does it annoy you? Your first reply was a variation of my username, and on your second reply you also mention my "goofy" username.
---
I'm using vats, i rarely miss. 
---
I'm familiar with penetration angles from world of tanks but i've never seen such a behaviour in fallout... But anyway, let's say it's a real thing and fallout has advanced penetration mechanics and the impact angle matters.
---
In this case anti-armor effect will be **by far** superior to anything else since it's practically a debuff on the armor of your target. It would outclass any effect in-game if that was the real deal. I do think AA is good but it's not even close to how good it would be if Fallout would implement effective armor thickness.
---
Same here.  Bugs and everything, I got my moneys worth from the $80 bundle.  I love this game even with all the issues.
---
Yes, 20 hours of content, before you repeat the same hour endlessly. But good thing we have all those carefully placed Mr Fuzzy dolls!
---
Seems like if cameras don't appear in the game this week Bethesda should just give us all 50 atoms as a good faith gesture.
---
They prolly won't be reskinned and there might be at least one legendary or rare BoS item to get from this
---
Can you confirm or deny the rumors that it will not be instanced to player groups? Huge bummer if it's not..
---
&gt; They said there is no update or downtime today. No servers going out. It's literally in the post. They baked the content into the game update last patch. They're just unlocking it which is exactly what they said to everyone. It is most definitely possible to make server changes to adjust content on the fly. It is done with plenty of games. Especially access to content when unlocked and ready.
---
For most games yes hotfixes can be done, but the beth devs who come in here has even said that fo76 can't receive hotfixes, which is why we couldn't launch nukes at all for a week a couple months ago. If FO76 could get hotfixes to change gameplay on the fly like most online games that would have been fixed the same day it went live. Not taken a week to be fixed in the next tuesdays patch.
---
&gt; They're just unlocking it which is exactly what they said to everyone. It is most definitely possible to make server changes to adjust content on the fly
---
No they aren't, it is locked behind manhole covers that aren't in the game yet. So until those manhole covers get added in, the dungeon is inaccessible.
---
&gt;So if The Burrows is there already.. And they're not taking down the servers, and literally said unlocking it without any downtime.. Then tell me, how is it so impossible they included it with the last update?
---
It isn't being unlocked, that is why everyone is flipping out in the subreddit today. Because this is just another promise beth has made and then broken.
---
&gt;Sorry, but you have a loose understanding of how operating a game works. You can hotfix without a patch or taking things down
---
Yes, most well coded online games you can do that. Unfortunately as from ladydevann, "FO76 can't be hotfixed due to how the servers operate on amazons cloud system".
---
That's a very good point. But it's a bit strange they wouldn't make provisions for the rest of the world in that respect.
---
not a bad thing. Gonna be crowded in there at opening time. Probably all day and night. I took tomorrow off hoping it will be slow during work hours the day after.
---
And a great warning that it's not a safe place for unknown people
---
I stated elsewhere that I have plenty of scrap in my stash and don't NEED the junk I drop at the event. I sometimes am far away from a stash, and totally involved in what I am doing but I want to get to the event to get that stupid damn imposter head so I travel there as fast as I can to make sure I get in a few licks. I don't need the junk people steal. I'm just saying I hate that they do it.
---
Lol yes xD
---
Just saw that daily challenge. Craft camera film and change the skin on my camera. Oh well. More missed Atoms.
---
9000 IQ Bethesda
---
oh. crap. That blows my brilliant plan out of the water.  took tomorrow off hoping it will be slow during work hours the day after.
---
Are they really THAT departmentalized that they‚Äôre incapable of coordinating the fact that the camera isn‚Äôt in this update but fail to make the change to the daily schedule? It makes them look lazy...
---
Tell me, how much does the DR change with an AA+mod weapon vs. a TS+mod weapon?  You're comparing apples to oranges.
---
What will I ever do without my 30 atoms :,(
---
There's one thin the Brotherhood does well and that's die.
---
maybe i have, but hey that's what a discussion is for
---
Nah they're not in the game yet.
---
No it's not, this isn't reality and the sky is the limit you child.
---
Is there lead in the Mire?
---
And please no spoilers.  Ad Victoriam, fellows!
---
Server latency. It happens to me in the bunker also. Just wait a few seconds and it will sync up.
---
I LOL at your name.
---
It‚Äôs fun Jeffery dahmering people why else equip the perk? There is nothing better in survival mode finishing a person with them ending up in your belly.
---
IRL, the magazine for a Gatling gun is gravity fed, and not spring loaded. There was a very steep learning curve for gunners back then, because if you cranked it too fast, you‚Äôd jam the weapon. The fire rate with the speedy receiver is really about as fast as it should fire.
---
It is not instanced.
---
Woukd be cool to have a new loot pool for it. I hope it isnt like the events where it is just cosmetics and a non legendary plan. Also, I hope the boss is not a reskin and some new mechanic.
---
Camera?
---
Yeah all of us died somehow in west Virgina lol. But we‚Äôre back and unofficial!
---
And while playing the banjo
---
Someone said daily was to craft film and mod on a lens.
---
this... this is a great post... thank you i needed to hear that
---
Fallout 76 is like chicago slums.  You can still live there and pretend it‚Äôs getting better.
---
But it‚Äôs really not and just filled with people who can‚Äôt afford to go anywhere else so they just deal with it.
---
The armory has some pencils in it, but you'll get pumped full of the stuff by turrets in there
---
Classic ü§£
---
nice!!!!! thanks so much, im copy'pasting this right now
---
it is appreciated!!!!!
---
Been delayed
---
Fear not my paper filing ally, I will personally keep my lips sealed on the secrets that lie below
---
217 Bloodied Sneak char here, PSN is AldorinDK. If nobody feels like joining forces though, I reckon I will try to solo it.
---
First off... don't shoot her while she's flying around. Waste of ammo. She has massive damage resistance in the air. If you look around you'll see that the vetrans are waiting for her to land.
---
Second... you need a gimmick. Limb damage, cryolator, syringer. Something to keep her on the ground when she lands. 
---
Third... find more damage perks and sacrifice other stuff for them during the queen fight. I give up white knight for the max adrenaline perk and switch back after the event.
---
How much more now?
---
It isn't shady at all, it is just a stupid oversight.
---
Cool. I get the reference, but got a little excited thinking there might be a lead source I missed. ;)
---
Given that the bans happen in waves, I imagine they're not going to go through every account methodically like that.
---
Burrows still coming today tho
---
Im a bit dead confused. I thought that we get a Update and Downtime as usual. Now I've read that there is no downtime and they will unlock it later without downtime...
---
Its close to 6 pm. I got the feeling EU got screwed once again just like the Beta. Probally can play the new stuff tomorrow and have maybe 30 mins. time to do the dailys.
---
I think it's safe to say the company's a bit disorganized at all times.
---
Wonder if they will give everyone to 20 cents of atoms for their mistakeü§î
---
Where did you read this?
---
Bethesda has never really commented on it, however the Data miners have found nothing to suggest it isn't just pure RNG. Players that have tracked their legendaries have made some claims, but honestly it's all just anecdotal.
---
Do you think it'll be an instance dungeon or just another area to explore?
---
Yup, these kinds of battles are awesome, especially when they are also fighting each other. I had one recently happen with Super Mutants,  Ferals, Scorched and a few Mr Gutsys - all about my level, but the gunfire was super chaotic and fun.
---
I'm not sure. I've heard luck does play a factor, but I've never seen any data supporting it.
---
Do you think it‚Äôs worth it investing only one point in it?
---
Not disagreeing, but curious how you know that for sure?
---
why is Xbox my favorite platform. It just is. The controller in my hands feels right. I like the look of it. I like the games that are developed on it IDk. I can't explain why just like someone on PC can't explain why they have to have a 1000 dollar graphics card or dual monitors it's just what they like. Why is the XBOX the most rainbow flag flying system out there and the only thing I cant stand about it is the reporting system it has. XBOX has about 50 percent MLG players and the other half kids, scumbags, crybabies etc. Now you add in the fact that the game you play on a system that already has a reporting system has now there own reporting system, too much reporting. Reporting shouldn't be allowed unless you actually where threatened with bodily harm and even then who cares. This game is not for kids. It's for Adults. It's a world that has been blown up by a nuclear warheads. There's monsters everywhere, mutated freak people, scumbag vendors, flying bats, toxic crusaders running around. Just let them destroy your camp. Disconnect from server. Don't report. Reporting is for peaches.
---
SEVEN MINUTES (I think). In SEVEN MINUTES the manholes will open and we will descend, we will descend, and we will crush all who stand in our way. Anyone on Xbox, feel free to join my game when the time comes for a live reading of this before battle, and when that battle comes I will prolly blast Primo Victoria in my mic. But hey it's something to do.
---
A Bethesda dude on this sub said it in one of the posts on the front page of this sub
---
Fair enough
---
Get ready to disconnect at end of burrows.  Or the beginning.  50/50
---
Gamertag's Fallout Nerd101
---
good advice, and yeah i have so many memories of great interactions with low levels, my favorite was (long story short) a younger kid i was helping out when he came to my house, after i gave him tons of starting loot and supplies, as i walked away, i could hear him say in his mic, "geez, what a guy!"
---
that made my month :)
---
You bet, solo all the way!
---
The solid colors are a cool idea too though bcuz it'll give teams and guilds an identity (.ie The Crimson Raiders in Red/Black, Savior Angels in White/Gold)

Ive been wondering about this, is there not actual Sheepsquatches in the gamr at this point?
---
Are you on PSN? I wanna buy this
---
Oh, okay! Thank you. I went to one and there was so much chaos, I couldn‚Äôt tell what was going on (besides a lot of people dying and respawning).
---
I appreciate the explanation.
---
Luck only determines the condition of gear that you find.
---
As for role playing survival game, not really is it.. The only thing hard, even in the early stages are the enemies, food is everywhere, as is water... Materials are in abundance for those who look. Its easy, all concepts of the game are easy, now fallout 4 survival, that's a challenge. You put fallout 4 mechanics into 76 and you've got a survival role play.
---
Bravo is   94112469  My team solved all three silos last night.  That is 100% confirmed.
---
on ps4, but that is very cool of you to offer, thank you
---
I thought that location is a mine with underground tunnels? Part of fireman quest I think.
---
Bethesda: *Hold my Nukashine*
---
I use dodgy and fire proof in my PA bloody build so they 100% work.  I know for a fact serendipity does NOT work in PA.  I‚Äôve never used bullet shield so I don‚Äôt know
---
Well let me get something out here first.
---
It's clear you cannot read - or understand what people are angry about. Because they have clearly said in the post above - that they will be unlocking Burrows today.
---
VERBATIM IN THE POST
---
&gt;Hi! There's no patch or downtime planned. The Burrows will unlock a little later today and you can head in!
---
From their Community Manager.
---
It's a good thing that what they're doing isn't considered a hotfix either. I was trying to get you to understand there is a difference between doing a hotfix, or making content adjustments or changes to server related functions on the fly. Which is absolutely possible. As per my examples.
---
Your reading comprehension is terrible. Sorry, but you're not worth replying too.
---
SB fights are only decent when you manage to cripple them. Not the only boring and bugged lackluster bullet-sponge enemy ingame so whatever. TBH more people would enjoy the eastern regions of the game without all of them
---
You mean it would take some sort of critical thinking and might actively reduce the amount of people that shoot on site?
---
I'm not sure what this monetization everyone speaks of is. All I see is cosmetic items no different them any other cash shop and I've seen allot worse cash shops. At least we don't have loot creates here shutters you get exactly what you pay for here. Not to mention you can earn adoms with out paying a dime. Not to mention theirs sales all the time if you take time to check the shop every day.
---
What I see when I see people taking about pay to win and monetization is people watching and reading too much hateful click bait videos and articles and looking at things with blinders on and joining the hate rather them stopping and thinking for themself.
---
Sadly dude that's how it is people just want to hate it's why they make the hateful sheep videos over useful ones. I'd like to see them moderate a bit more because this is getting out of hand. I would hate to be devs these days  because releasing any new game has been toxic.
---
Nah just asking based off a few phrases you used lol nothing suss
---
Whats the weekly?
---
All they can really offer up are cosmetics and non-legendary plans. If we get any new weapons it'll be with Nuclear Winter
---
Easiest Way to complete sheepsquatch event. 
---
1) Start event. 
---
2) drop nuke on the edge of event. 3) ??? 
---
4) profit
---
What're we looking at Manley?
---
99% of the playerbase wishes all SBs to be Fissure sites only without wandering off as is. Please no
---
oh fuck
---
Thank you for the link!
---
I just think you attract annoying players of the game because you are infact one of those players. I wouldnt say I'm "offended". it's like being offended by an episode of South park. We've all heard childish edgy humor. Is your user name a Family Guy reference?
---
I‚Äôve modded mine since the patch. Where are you finding your hold up?
---
You can have a flaming pitchfork
---
It's a weird event. I found the best way for me to help is to become a conduit on all 3 pylons, then stay alive as long as possible even if it means hiding behind the building or whatever. I spam the Ss with grenades, preferably orbital strikes. Or if on my alt, I use the cryolater, that really really helps. If you don't want to be a conduit, and don't know (like me) the right armor/perks whatever to keep from dying constantly, I suggest killing the ads as much as possible, that helps a LOT, and getting a few licks on the Ss to make sure you get the loot when it dies (if it dies lol) . You're going to die a LOT, it's part of it. I just die and run back up
---
Wheeeeeen
---
I've had friends throwing all sorts of hypothesis. I used to do it too in the early days, but now I'm pretty sure it is all just RNG.
---
Much easier to implement, easy to change / update, and less chances of having bugs as a result of 'multi-conditional layers which depend on too many factors'; if that makes sense.
---
"Fuck everyone with nicer things than me"
---
The quest rewards in this game are complete garbage. The game offers no incentive to actually do quest. You always get some 1 star piece of crap or a non legendary armor. 
---
Never understood this design.
---
that sucks
---
My apologies for poor choice in words. The code for bravo I helped solve was for the week before. April 1st to April 8th. I will edit my previous comment for you. Honestly felt like it was just last week.
---
Awesome job for your friend solving the previous code.
---
Oof. What a fuck up. It may not seem like a big deal to some, but as someone who has been grinding atoms to get whatever I want from the shop, I find this fucked up. I'm really hoping they fix it. The scummy thing to do rn would be to just leave it, especially if they add new items to the shop today.
---
I agree.  My character is built the same way.  As soon as someone in PA and a melee weapon comes clanking in, my character will be screwed.  I've gotten used to it at this point.  I might give the burrow a try in the very early of the morning to see I can avoid the crowds.
---
Oh, and since you'll argue some more. 
---
https://np.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bdnhuw/whos_excited_for_the_dungeon_tomorrow/el0qnbk/
---
There is a comment from an hour ago regarding The Burrows today from the Community Manager here on Reddit.
---
Good lord are we still going on about something that we don't even know how it will be implemented entirely?
---
I was hoping instanced but I just read that it isn't
---
Are you fucking serious? I don‚Äôt give a fuck what gear they have, I was hoping this wouldn‚Äôt be nuked whitespring all over again.
---
Maybe you can wake up their after a nukashine bender
---
Well ..im going to turn on pacifist and start lobbing orbital strikes...
---
&gt;It's a good thing that what they're doing isn't considered a hotfix either. I was trying to get you to understand there is a difference between doing a hotfix, or making content adjustments or changes to server related functions on the fly. Which is absolutely possible. As per my examples.
---
Not on these servers, every change they have ever made on the servers since BETA has required downtime. They haven't made a single "change on the fly" without bringing the servers down.
---
&gt;Your reading comprehension is terrible. Sorry, but you're not worth replying too.
---
Seems the only person with terrible reading comprehension here is you. You seem to think you know better than the bethesda devs about how the server software works. They have said multiple times, ANY CHANGES required on the server requires the server to go offline. So the fact there is no downtime going on today there will be no changes.
---
Do you have any proof at all of them making any changes without bringing the servers down? Because a quick search on this subreddit will quickly show you that every single change they have made had to be done with the servers being taken offline.
---
I've posted about this multiple times in the past. They absolutely need to revamp how you are alerted to your base coming under attack. Make it flash in the center of your screen. Make it consistent. Something! -- There have been many times where I was not notified at all that my base was under attack.
---
YES
---
no need to nerf anything, but (my opinion) you or I should not be able to get TOO powerfull.
---
new enemies...... hmmm  tricky to do, NOT PVP, but alot more savvey enemies that will activly engage rather than hide behind a tree. improved AI. easer said than done.
---
I should maybe keep my mouth shut here,what if they removed the quest markers and gave you more clues instead. as another comment... more challenge.
---
Just a jerk that loves to bully. You did right in reporting him. Next time put a hidden traps with fires &amp; radiation.
---
Jsyk T-51b or Ultracite PA provides better resistance than X-01. X-01 has best radiation resistance though
---
The enclave will live foreeever
---
Did you use mods you found it in the wild or crafted ones?
---
From what I've been reading on the forums The mods found in the wild are broken and can't be attached to anything
---
Agreed, and I'll add that I've never played in a team, and I still like the game a lot! $25 is a steal.
---
k
---
Dodgy? Because you can watch your AP go down as you‚Äôre being hit.  Couple that with just running a couple tests with and without it on and notice mitigation differences.  
---
Fireproof is a no brainer test, I run explosive weapons so I can test it by shooting my feet and looking at damages numbers off and on.  It‚Äôs very noticeable difference.
---
As for serendipity, with PA on you will never see the little notification of the vault boy dodging attacks.  Second you take off PA so can watch it start to activate.
---
Not mentioned is blocker perk, hands down best mitigation skill in the game.  Every build I have blocker on.  Even if it‚Äôs just a 1 str sniper build, still 1 point blocker.
---
I think about this all the time. My main guy is a crafter and modder. He has it all, when I want to mod something for one of my other characters I have to wait for a friend to log in to be my mail man.
---
If you choose to go and get all overpowered and unkillable.  That‚Äôs your choice. The game is a healthy state. If you find the game too easy or boring. Then maybe the problem is you and not the game. Sure play your way. But the way you play comes with some caveats.
---
Yeah, you might want to bring some ammo and a stimpak to West Tek when you get there.
---
maybe there should have been since you guys clearly screwed up again XD The challenges are BUGGED :@ Asking me to craft camera stuff which ain't in the game.
---
Hope you are already planning some emergency maintenace for tommorow.
---
No it's from a music album. I've got is since I was an edgy annoying little kid.
---
Considering you can do only one weekly survival challenge and then that character had that weapon. Yes there should be a way to pass that weapon to another char on your account.
---
What does the burrows have to do with cameras? We are talking about cameras here and them being added in.
---
Started to re-install.
---
Proceed to stop install.
---
Profit.
---
RIP SERVERS lol
---
the game has plenty of content to keep me interested, but the stealth nerfs and bugs are just crap. the sheepsquatch is a total doozy, the SBQ is also still nearly impossible even with a group of fully kitted players. only the good legendaries drop from the broken bosses, the legendary vendor gets pushed back but we get 2 dlc in the meantime. oh but the atom shop content keeps rolling out no problem... if bethesda really cared about us and their game it would have been fixed by now. half the bugs are from skyrim and the other half are clearly from FO4. but hey at least they fixed the lever action reload animation...
---
well. Did not know that. I tihnk there are a couple of legendary pitchforks on my mule. Time to give them a look over.
---
I have gotten the exact same weapon in Watoga from legendaries in the same area, so I'm not so sure it's completely random. Zealot's powerfist, it's my plastic farming weapon.
---
also 5 intelligence for gunsmith. i'm just to lazy to repair stuff. 
---
with luck tormentor is switch able for an automatic rifle for SBQ fights to break her wings.
---
Well damn, I was really hoping for Instanced D:
---
It's not instanced. This is mentioned briefly in our recent [PAX East Panel](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/403037417?t=00h49m52s), but we're still working to bring that tech to the game for future content.
---
This is pretty much what I'm forced to do, too. At 34 I only just now got my first ammosmith card, and that's helped but I still can't keep up without having a session here and there specifically devoted to getting lead and steel. 
---
I'm hoping once I get high enough level, double ammosmith, super duper, some luck boosts, and a lead deposit will be all I need. Because damn, I go through bullets fast. Like 500-600 in a 30 minute exploring/questing session.
---
Some people are saying it might go live when the shear terror event in the atomic ship ends, but once again its speculation beth should really commit uh nicate to us ahead of time if when we should expect things like this
---
Fuck bad game design.
---
It was stated on another thread by a CM it will be open to the server.
---
I‚Äôm going to start doing this more.
---
What I told you...it is already confirmed it aint instanced, means it already s#ck and aint even close to what "dungeons" means to be.
---
Apparently it's supposed to be now
---
That‚Äôs kinda what I did - hit the mr. gutsys (gutsies?) as much as possible - die, respawn, repeat. One respawn said the sheepsquatch was vulnerable and last thing I saw was it running straight at me then death. I don‚Äôt know if I helped or hurt the event. You give me hope that I sorta was doing the right thing.
---
Same. Always carry a back up rifle. For me laser rifle.
---
Not that I've heard of. New content today doesn't require downtime, so I can only assume it won't be today. Maybe we'll get an update from u/ladydevann ?
---
found them they just popped up on my screen
---
Why are you arguing, when the Community Manager has said multiple times that there will be no downtime? 
---
You're just starting to look pathetic.
---
Give a child the internet, they think they understand everything. 
---
I'm literally giving you proof they're unlocking the content without taking it down. It's in the post here - and in my reply above. 
---
#Hi! There's no patch or downtime planned. The Burrows will unlock a little later today and you can head in!
---
Can I make it any bigger for you? Or will your reading comprehension fail you some more? 
---
If every change they've made has had to have the server taken offline.. tell me.. how do they update the Atomic Shop without taking it offline? Please - explain that to me.
---
Flaming deathclaw gauntlet pls
---
This event is new and isn‚Äôt instanced. Just a new unexplored part of the map. People are starved for new content. So everyone on the server will be in there with you. For the next while, no one will be alone.
---
I usually just leave them with wanted tag even if they griefed my camp. I love seeing griefers lonely without radar as punishment ;)
---
And cry when the end reward is a 1 star wood arm lol
---
I was thinking storage lockers in a train station. Watoga, maybe. Rent them for a number of caps, can be opened by anyone that has the code. Holds a limited number of items for X amount of time. Say 1 hour?
---
People would use these to transfer, it is a fresh cap drain for the economy. And makes people happy.
---
THE TIME HAS COME, COMRADES! THE SEWERS HAVE OPENED! GO FORTH WITH YOUR RIFLES, YOUR BLADES, AND YOUR FISTS! LEAVE NONE IN YOUR PATH AS OUR WRATH CLEANSES THE TUNNELS BELOW!

anyone know where the mnohole cover is?  
---
Near the armory and by highway 65 are what ive read, but im not finding one in either of those spots
---
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeell crap

If you are kililng ads then you are absolutely doing the heroic thing. Most people ignore the pylons and the ads and just want to kill the Ss not realizing that they could be helping those who are better suited to kill it. For instance, I hit it with the cryolater and slowed it down and made it possible to kill it more easily. But no one was keeping the ads off me, and people were stealing my loot while I was doing it lol. No respect
---
I'm leaning more towards they ignore the problem because that means less atoms for people to get for free this week. We'll likely see items that are in the shop for only a week's starting today to compliment it too. I really hope they aren't going to be that scummy, but I don't see them fixing it. Even if we get vocal on here, some idiot is going to start the "I'm tired of complaints" train and completely undermine the issue and upset players.
---
I'll take a closer look at my build and see if I can add any additional damage cards for the fight.  I think I have 20 lvls at the moment so I should be able add something.  Looks like I'm going to be doing a silo run tonight.  My  Grognak Ax has limb damage and 40% more power attack damage and I can't remember the 3rd one.  Maybe more damage if the target is at 100%.
---
haha, I already saw it coming weeks ago, yet people were like:"nO ItS iNsTaNcEd", f#cking idiots
---
I don't mean to doubt you, it's just that you didn't solve Bravo 2 weeks ago either. Sorry. I personally know all the people who are solving at NukaCrypt. So I'm not sure if you're solving, or just taking the codes from other websites and posting them here. It's always nice to see people solving. Feel free to send me a direct message with your NukaCrypt username so that we can connect!
---
I'm a little older guys, what does this mean?
---
Lol 260, just say I g so I don't come off like a noob...
---
There is nothing to fix, get better guns or more ammo.  I think this was one of the more fun quests that I really enjoyed.  Annoying part was I am a melee build and did not have a gun/ammo for the target practice so I had to find one.
---
I have been seeing something similar. With level 3 locks, when I pick it, it makes the sound as if i completed it and then kicks me out of the screen. When i go to pick the lock again, the door opens.
---
If they implement it by level as suggested this wouldn't occur, you'd instead see a lvl 25 or 30 one.  But yeah it can happen now if you are in an area that was just walked thru by a level 100+ character maybe not glowing mythic but a 91 deathclaw can and has occurred.
---
Ok, but where is this manhole you speak of? Running around Harper's ferry like an idiot over here...
---
Excellent, thank you
---
What if we are getting the camera today
---
It's open guys
---
It means your version of the Burrows isn‚Äôt unique to you and your squad, so very likely you‚Äôll load into an area that‚Äôs been completely cleaned out before you by others on the server.
---
Can't, blocked at work.  But thanks for helpful suggestion.
---
I've heard it sometimes even turns it into a trident
---
I have two 3\* gauntlet's in my stash at the moment.  I have been looking for the 3rd claw mod for them but haven't found them yet.  I'm usually in PA so haven't been searching all that hard for it.  My regular armor isn't that great so I end up in PA all the time these days.
---
You certainly had fun in survival.
---
lots of ghouls. i died though being dumb
---
I‚Äôm guessing the area will change slightly when it goes live. Similar to fasnacht, but I actually haven‚Äôt went to check it out.
---
God Bless America!
---
Its a rock sir
---
A LOT more ammo and stimpaks.
---
as for the targets..........1 target.......1 round........actually..the practice here woun't be wasted.
---
Yeeeeeeeeeeeee...
---
I'm still waiting for the bar decor and Nukashine PA skin.
---
&gt; Why are you arguing, when the Community Manager has said multiple times that there will be no downtime? 
---
What? I'm not, nowhere did I say there would be downtime today. I actually have been saying the exact opposite this entire time. I've been trying to explain to you that the cameras aren't coming today because they aren't taking the servers offline to put a patch or hotfix in to add them. Jesus are you incapable of reading?!? 
---
&gt;Give a child the internet, they think they understand everything. 
---
Says the kid that thinks "sweet summer child" is somehow condescending. The fact you hadn't heard that turn of phrase shows you are far younger than I am, so if anyone here is a child it would be you.
---
 &gt;I'm literally giving you proof they're unlocking the content without taking it down. It's in the post here - and in my reply above. 
---
No they aren't, you said it yourself it was added in the last patch, so they had to bring it down to add it in that patch. You really are this bad at reading aren't you?!?
---
&gt;If every change they've made has had to have the server taken offline.. tell me.. how do they update the Atomic Shop without taking it offline? Please - explain that to me.
---
ROFL, you don't realize the atom shop isn't part of the server? The atom shop is based around HTML coding, it is basically a glorified front end to their online webstore.
---
do a hard refresh(hold ctrl and hit f5). It should change the code provided its not already 94112469.
---
I recall the mention that raids were going to be instanced, but nothing about how dungeons would be non-instanced.
---
As someone who was very much looking forward to a co-op pve experience I can say that while I am greatful for more content I am not excited about non instanced content like this because of a myriad of issues that come with open access.
---
Instead of a container
---
What about a incamp mailbox?
---
Just mail items to and from mules to mains.
---
As long as your account isn‚Äôt banned just email stuff between your toons via the mailbox
---
You could build one with mats and it follows you wherever your toons camp goes.
---
You could put stash constraints in that whatever your shipping to has to have available space.
---
Like you couldn‚Äôt leave stuff in your mailbox indefinitely. You‚Äôd have a 2-3 day window of items being sent and received to your stash storage.
---
If not it gets returned to sender.
---
Hell, assign it a cost like 20 caps or ship weight based so it compels folks to clear their mailbox
---
Do the measurements yourself or just give a good excuse why you won't.
---
wtf? just when I thought bethesda was turning things around
---
The reps that post here have been active the last couple hours answering a few questions, I find it hard to believe they haven't seen these challenge posts.
---
naaaissss
---
Dun Dun! What if?
---
I hope so but I've seen people say it got postponed, so I'm not betting on it, but hey it could be a possibility!
---
I saw him in the bog for the first time the other day.  He ran up to me and said something along the lines of, "I'd like to kick your ass, but it looks like life has already done that. BOOM ROASTED!"  Then he presented me with a piece of paper and disappeared.  **sniff** that hurt a little.
---
The Burrows are now available :)
---
Don‚Äôt forget about also not being able to add mods to weapons. I bought a few new ones just after the patch and can‚Äôt use them.
---
Why is that even called "Dungeon", does people in Beth haven't played online games that have actually real dungeons? C'mon, that is not dungeon, that just... location.
---
Oh? Quite curious! Yeah, edited my original comment. Began to realize that people are talking about mod boxes, not learned plans. I‚Äôve been able to mod my armor via Plans I‚Äôve already known.
---
As someone else stated in another comment.  Blocker is single handed the best mitigation perk.  Even if you run a 1 str sniper build. That point should be blocker
---
They're usually really active
---
Right up until there is a major issue that causes community backlash
---
This has been happening to me as well. Some times its double the crap I don't want but I'm not against it cuz some of it was good for the team. Are you on xb1?
---
I didn't think it had been nerfed because I have never seen a legendary in watoga streets. Ghouls inside some of the buildings, yes. But never a bot on the street.
---
Hi thanks for your report on this. These Challenges aren't currently intended to be live. We're currently planning to release the Camera next week.
---
Ah, well at least I'm used to it after tons of WS farming and the Nuke Quantum paint. Thanks for the answer!

 &gt; Hi thanks for your report on this. These Challenges aren't currently intended to be live. We're currently planning to release the Camera next week.
---
Can you tell me where the manhole cover is?!
---
I got a tse mg42, 5000 bullets, x01 power armor and a whole aftwrnoon, im going solo
---
Charging barrel = rifle perks 
---
Charging shotgun barrel = rifle perks 
---
Auto barrel = commando
---
Also expected this and made a post requesting clarification last week. They said during the Boston panel that vault raid were their 1st work on instance tech, so unless the Burrows was developed afterwards, it couldn‚Äôt have been instanced
---
They claimed they do.
---
It means that all players in the world are "sharing" the area and we'll be competing with each other for loot the same as Whitespring.  What that means is the high levels with great gear will be blasting through everything and lowbies are gonna have to wait until they somehow get great gear to compete, or run into a friendly player willing to let them get a tiny piece of the action.
---
omg. Why do they keep putting such crap in the atom shop? Maybe if they put some sexy skins for all the guns that people are actually asking for in there then they wouldn't need to consider selling repair kits.
---
Was there a rollback or something in the last hour? I lost a while bunch of mainquest progression?
---
Ha! I was so overwhelmed I forgot to look for my loot. Oh well. I got revived once by a player but every other time I had to respawn, which was fine - considering the carnage.
---
All I know is I died repeatedly, so maybe I could equip full mysterious savior. As far as armor goes, it chewed through my pretty decent body armor AND my PA (once I realized it was *that* kind of fight, I threw it on) like it was chopped liver. Next time, I‚Äôll prepare a little better and tweek from there.
---
I use the mg42 goes through 308 like toilet paper, i just trade for it, 1 cap 1 bullet, usually buy 1000s at a time
---
Awesome man! Yah I grouped up with some guys that dropped a nuke in Whitesprings and I just started a few days ago so I was only level 18. By the time we were done I was level 25. I could not believe how many ghouls spawned lol. Game is legit shit
---
i probably should have just picked my camp up and followed them and spammed nukes on there's, would have been more entertaining üôÑ not sure what fun people get from destroying people's stuff they usually just lose a few caps and that's it
---
Is this the same floral door that was a limited time exclusive previously?
---
*unless you are in survival mode
---
there were two of them, they probably would have just killed the one wanted
---
It's delayed
---
Is it open now?
---
You dont... they delayed and Beth made another oopsie in a long lost of posies for this game
---
No one will do a solo run. They may plan to, and bring no one- but they will find 30 other players already in there with them.
---
.... really?
---
Jump server. Should fix
---
So?  I'm typically carrying 100+ at a time until I just get tired of seeing so many and sell off a bunch.  It's not like you should be burning through them that quick, they're plentiful and virtually no weight (thank god) so just grab them all.
---
Go to a new server and poof, magic
---
Such dicks looking to pvp
---
That's how I view them, revenue with no weight.
---
Silly question, where‚Äôs the armory ?
---
Have you improved your turrets?
---
Home defense upgrades your defenses
---
I‚Äôm thinking for mine, missiles or lasers 
---
I‚Äôd like to see a .50 cal BMG turrets
---
Need super sledge skins, gun skins, and more PA skins...
---
Yeah that‚Äôs not cool, i lost all my hardened mass once because I got spawn killed from a scorched beast at whitesprings while loading in. Since it was a spawn point I saw a guy immediately rushing to my bag and all my hardened mass was gone... I often picked stuff up after someone died at en event to give it back to them, once there was a guy with around 30 ballistic fiber on him... that would have been gone for good if someone else would have seen this.
---
You may be on a ghost team. Go to your social menu and click on yourself and see if there‚Äôs an option to leave team. Happens frequently with my playgroup. Sometimes it happens even after leaving the game for me
---
Don‚Äôt know why but having the same issue on PS4
---
Harpers Ferry, once you go there you will get a marker on your compas
---
Just an fyi, ESO isn't a Bethesda game
---
Ohhh okay, well at least you've noticed this. Guess thanks for clearing up the confusion! XD
---
great, missing the ability to make learned plans like the hardened receiver for my lever action is wonderful, not to mention the missing, already learned, ability to mod armor. oh and weapons breaking much faster than normal, just in time for repair kits. i am nearing my breaking point with BGS. i'd rather they take the game offline for 2 months before releasing another atom shop item
---
It means the game won't create a "private room" for you and your team when you enter Burrows, non instanced means everyone will be in the very same tunnel at the same time.
---
Why are people pushing this idea? This adds nothing to the game.
---
Right and for the most part I agree, skins and cosmetics are fine, however before the community uproar, skins and cosmetics were an insane price... for 1 piece of armor, or equipment or PA it was something like 10$.
---
And for most games, this is ok - but most games with an in-game cash shop are free-to-play. We shelled out 60$ for this game and got something half-baked *with an expectation that we we're going to pay for additional goodies.*
---
*Now,* with the impending "repair kit" we're seeing pay-to-win features we were promised weren't going to be implemented.
---
I would farm Watoga at least once per day/session, but I think in general less farming locations is a good thing if they increase random legendaries throughout the world and increased their frequency in events. Watoga was really easy to farm and it just became a daily chore and not me actually playing the game.
---
I'm hopeful that this is more of an attempt to push people into the Burrows and things like it, as well as setting up the Legendary Vendor, rather than just farming and server hopping the same location over and over.
---
You sure?
---
How do you get the stuff next to your name.
---
Let the floodgates open!
---
Is junk REALLY worth getting stressed over..?
---
If you fast travel to harpers ferry its directly west of it.
---
Just walk in that general direction and you'll notice 2 new compass markers that look like a water drop inside of a circle
---
People suck. I wonder if they do that in real life too. A handfull of staples from the office supply room...
---
Im doing it RN
---
ITS LIVE!  The sewers are marked on the map
---
Ffs i was happy because those weekly and daily challenges were first easy ones since nukashine update
---
Save the ammo on the target shooting, just disarm and punch each target.
---
Waiting Fallout 3 powerfist skin
---
Because I  have had previous experience with a player destroying my CAMP when it was unlocked, now I just don't let them in full stop. It's a choice, my choice. I particularly dislike people who don't like to be told no, if I'm asked something which requires a choice, yes or no, and I say no, there's no reason to get all up in my face when it's not the answer they wanted.
---
So I do it in PA. It doesn't seem to harm my PA at all, or not noticeably. So much rather die every 5 seconds than repair my body armor constantly.
---
You haven‚Äôt though... I‚Äôm at 1174 an am still finding new random spawn locations that interact differently than other locations. Sure you found all the locations and your map looks filled but your missing so many details that clutter the locations.
---
It doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúnew‚Äù so probably
---
These Challenges currently aren't intended to be available, and we're still currently planning to release the Camera next week.
---
They've already said they are working on instances and that it should be part of the Vault Raids when those are released.
---
Its not out yet, next week it'll be out. I know this cause bethesda replied to my post about it! XD
---
Ik you'll have to wait till patch 9 for the cameras until than enjoy the burrows update it just went live
---
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

---
 &gt; Thanks for you report! These Challenges currently aren't intended to be available, and we're still currently planning to release the Camera next week.
---
All owned by zenimax yes. Shouldn‚Äôt be a barrier to pass on good ideas and things to avoid
---
WOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
How about locking an item (I.e 3 star armor piece) so that we don‚Äôt unintentionally drop or sell it?
---
And? Lots of people have had their camps destroyed, locked or unlocked, it doesn't matter. All that guy did was pick a lock, so all he wanted was to check out your camp. He wasn't griefing or harassing you
---
im all about this info, im gonna start a new character in may and i will be speccing it as you suggested!
---
Yeah, I have double shotgun turrets behind the door, but I might add some radiation emitters too.
---
There's nothing to fix here it's just a challenge. I thought it was funny cause you're expecting something less threatening and Bam!
---
I'm not stressed over it. I'm just stating that it's shitty behavior to steal people's shit and espcially to 'farm' people's shit at the event. I honestly don't care about my own dropped loot. It's others that don't realize they are going to die every 5 seconds, I am sad for them getting their shit stolen by lazy twats
---
Yes you did, and you are most certainly welcome and appreciated, I might add.  I just wanted to remind you of why you built such a camp in the first place. Most build a walled fortress to keep everyone else out. You knew it could be destroyed and targeted by asshats, yet you still built it. I have played since launch and am level 200 and I still love to come across and marvel at camps, like yours, that are open and inviting to all players, in my wanderings.
---
Is today Day One?
---
Are you serious been waiting for an update or something but cool glad to know let's see how far I can get solo with a bloodied build with some beast ass weapons *dies right away... Probably
---
These are great tips.  Turns out I'm playing on the wrong server, and my guns suck, my perks are terrible, and my strategy is wrong.
---
Bethesda needs to make plans for a craftable Short Bus so I can drive my idiot self to the Scorched Earth events.
---
Oops, missed one! 
---
New Super Mutant Paint (Super Sledge) - 500
---
I've been haveing the same thing. And so has my friends. Bethesda explain lol
---
Thanks
---
Then they just take us all.
---
Wtf that makes no sense, half of challanges are based on camera
---
Just fast travelled to Harpers Ferry and got met with a black screen and a crash. Ahhh good ol Bethesda XD
---
How do you get INSIDE The Burrows? Aren't they underground?
---
You are one thick headed child, aren't you?
---
Let me break this down for you in a more simple way. 
---
If they are not taking the servers down or causing downtime for The Burrows.. that means the content was added to the game last update? Right? Okay.. so you literally said to me..
---
&gt;No they aren't, it is locked behind manhole covers that aren't in the game yet. So until those manhole covers get added in, the dungeon is inaccessible.
---
You stated that they will NOT be adding The Burrows because it requires an OUTAGE and an UPDATE. However... you keep dodging the facts. They said in 2 different posts now - that they will be unlocking The Burrows today. Without any downtime. Without a patch.
---
So that means what? It was included in the game update we had recently. They are simply unlocking it for people. Without what? An outage.
---
So now that we understand that basic concept. Is it really so hard to assume that the Camera may not potentially be unlocked the same way? People weren't aware The Burrows was already in our client data. So why couldn't the Camera? 
---
Also - how are you to know they didn't update their methodology for their server capabilities? It is more than possible. Not likely - but regardless. I don't care who said what about hotfixes - this isn't a hotfix. I've also seen comments from Devs say things about their games that are completely wrong - as well. Because PR does not have a full understanding, and only explains what they're told or loosely understand. This is factual.
---
You keep dodging my point with the Burrows to now bring up the camera again, when this devolved into you arguing that The Burrows won't be added to the game today - because we need a patch. Then you keep dodging my points where the COMMUNITY MANAGER has said MULTIPLE TIMES that they will be UNLOCKING The Burrows today.
---
----
---
I am perfectly aware of how the Atomic Shop functions. But there you go again, with a condescending "ROFL". You are truly one of the most pathetic people I've ever met on Reddit. Your type is the cancer of the community. Can't have a logical discussion without acting out. 
---
How about this then, Mr.Knowledge. Maybe take this into consideration? They could have even went as far as having the content sitting and running on a timer to unlock in the game - just as MANY GAMES have done for years. Requiring no downtime. Nothing at all.
---
There are plenty of functions within servers that allow for slight adjustments or tuning on the fly. Especially Dynamic/Event systems. They run on separate logic generally - and that allows the rate to be modified. The same logic can be applied to multiple things. Especially if you just want specific content to be on a lock/timer. This has been done for over a decade in games in my memory.
---
You keep contradicting yourself - yet build up your ego with arrogance? Excellent. 
---
You know what? Believe what you want. I'm blocking your replies, because you are making a fool of yourself.
---
I'm in but there's no quest?
---
Yes. Approx 24hrs left.
---
Oh no, you can‚Äôt do a daily for 20 atoms. The horror.
---
**I powder my cockatiel for the rib cage slaughter!!!*
---
Again it was planned for today but they still need to do some changes to it.  Honestly I prefer working content over rushed content still it is aggravating to see two daily challenges taken by content you cant access
---
How long left on those 24 hours?
---
You won't be able to, the entire server will likely be in the same area, so there will be no 'solo' runs.  I'm kind of concerned actually how this will affect completion.  Will people show up and if someone is already almost finished with the area event or whatever will it suddenly cause it to complete for the new person?  Hopefully we won't miss out on the experience.
---
I've had that bug happen too, but only once. The boxes were all empty until like the very end of the event. I think it's something to do with server latency.
---
So are the team actually planning to do anything about the challenges? 
---
Or are we just stuck with impossible to complete challenges?
---
Yes isn't that cool too? Got him killed without wasting a single bullet &amp; he died cowardly from friendly too :D
---
Try completely closing out your browser you opened nukacrypt with so it can refresh. The code worked for me last night/this morning. 
---
If you can do you happen to remember what the code was that failed?
---
Love all the people admitting they duped or bought duped parts.
---
An un-nuked Whitespring is still pretty hard to farm because everyone and their younger brother is there, and that's been "the spot" since launch.  I'm guessing Burrows is gonna be even more crowded if all the enemies are lvl 50+, because xFingrBlastr69x has no time for lvl 35-40 gear.
---
They need to let the armor pen perks work for them. Perk swapping is cumbersome enough already.
---
Ah. Well it should be on later. I would screenshot the page for you and pm it but it literally says it will open later
---
If you are on PC you can get it for as low as 8e from cdkey stores online. Bought 3 copies so far.
---
Approx 24. Thats why I said 24. Sorry if I wasn't clear enough. My bad yo!
---
Well it seems this game is sliding back down the shit stream
---
Fat man isn't it?
---
I have Max chrisma and Max luck. I get shit loot
---
Good idea. Thinking about it know - it was a knee-jerk reaction for me to put on PA, but I totally forgot to equip the perk cards for it. I usually don‚Äôt use it, have other perks going for reg armor.
---
Live and learn.  
---
Am I right I‚Äôm guessing this is an SBQ level event?
---
Yes if you fast travel to harpers ferry and walk west on the road you'll see the two new map icons indicating where they are.  Follow them and look for the manholes
---
Found it! Thanks!
---
Got it, thanks! :)
---
No worries! Just wanted to be sure I didn't miss out :) thanks for letting us know :)
---
Nah, X-01 has the second highest ballistic resistance and highest energy. Rad resist is second highest.[https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Power+Armor]
---
I'd be tempted to use the Ultracite PA but getting the mods for it is far too much trouble. I have almost all the mods I want for the X-01.
---
Alcohol challenges were already impossible for me, they fucked up the level up challange so no atoms for me again today/this week
---
Does it take 2 to revive someone?? Never done it yet haha
---
Respawn sucks
---
Yeah you got a little bit of time haha
---
Yesss!
---
I'll likely do my first run solo, just so I can read and hack/unlock everything.
---
Are you sure you don't get stressed over it? You sure have a lot of moral judgement to pass out over something you don't care about.
---
Think of it, a phone that never runs out of power...
---
How does it work haven't gone in yet waiting on my friend t ok get his ass on
---
Yeah it's a solid weapon for sure
---
Your choices have made the game too easy. Don't blame the game.
---
Just becasuse it's there, doesn't mean you have to use it. 
---
"I've stacked perks and mutations and legendary weapons andmde myself the most powerful player ever!"
---
"this game3 is too easy".
---
"Child"? Pfft. Whatever you say, son. How does "hey, make a fun build, instead of an overly powerful one, and the game remains a challenge" have anything to do with "reality"? You're not even making sense at this point.
---
If a game like ARK can have infinite storage then so should fallout. The arbitrary 800 pounds is ridiculous.
---
And how or where do we pick up the quest?
---
Hey Lorax, just because you don't like stuff doesn't mean others don't.
---
Nah you gotta take your console or pc with you. Or train a monkey how to do it. That comes from the community forums. Lmao totally just being a dick :P
---
Although I can be on everyday, there definitely needs to be 3 days to cover people!
---
Yeah, I got mine for 40 and do stuff regret it
---
Brain fog in wv
---
Rabbit plushy is available on the Atomic Shop for 200 atoms now!  
---
[https://imgur.com/8jweX2X](https://imgur.com/8jweX2X)
---
It's not a problem. :) I hope you have fun launching nukes.
---
Cause crack
---
Couldn't this lead to players repeatedly killing someone just by reviving them?
---
Higher luck gives you items with better condition, that's about how basically the consensus goes. The loot drop system is driven by RNG and there is a loot-chance table turning that random number into a legendary item with effects. Bethesda didn't confirm any of this, nor is likely they will do as it will facilitate a lot of people trying to game the system.
---
Also yes, we don't have any decisive proof or measurement about the relation between a specific character, the current server and the loot drop chances. 
---
Based on many of our loot tracking efforts, what's also almost certain is that all possible loot is pooled (\~200 items) and legendary effect chances are not uniform (i.e., like getting Two-shot or Quad is not equally likely). There are indications, however, that you can tip the chances into your favor, but it may still take a lot of drops.
---
Agree totally, I‚Äôm honestly so confused about why they seem to have asked their sister studio for zero advice.
---
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO iM IN
---
I‚Äôm running it solo.......... but not by choice :/
---
If ever, if it becomes a good spot to farm legendaries.  It's nearly impossible to look on the map and see Whitespring is empty.  There's almost always at least two dots at the golf club and one at the hotel, and that place has been "the spot" since launch day one.
---
Is it talking about the camera specifically or is it saying to take x amount of pictures.
---
Did I miss something? Roadmap states camera update comes out today.....Was it delayed? (I only recall seeing the delay for player vending)
---
Yeah just leave the server and come back.
---
I had something similar happen the other night. Was in a nuke zone and a Behemoth shows up in the gate area across from the train station. All hell breaks loose. 
---
I'm s sniper and my the behemoth is just absorbing my bullets and it's lifebar is barely dropping so I switched to my other option...orbital strike beacons. Two of them and the behemoth goes down along with a few robots.
---
As I ran in to loot, an Assaultron shows up and vaporizes me with its headshot of death beam. 
---
I had to respawn at the mine and walk back, then snipe the Assaultron in the midsection just to get my loot bag back.
---
Yeah totally. Love giving people stuff. I drop as much as I can at the overseer's camp &amp; Flatwoods &amp; such. Often drop bags there too full of mats for noobs to fix their stuff. Sometimes I craft full leather armor level 5 and put it at the overseer's
---
It literally says, mod a camera lens.
---
Theres a dead boss scribe with a holotape on them grab and listen to it and then you'll get the quest "waste management"
---
I do prefer the use of semi  myself western and snub nose as well as a combat or hand made for me plz
---
It improves them, but if they just can't shoot the enemies it doesn't matter how strong they are. The last patch supposedly increased the range of turrets to match enemies, but sometimes the enemies get in a spot where the turrets are just too dumb to shoot at them. The giant cliff next to my home is one of them.
---
I am tired of interacting with you. Have a nice day.
---
I'm not arguing about whether this was an intended nerf, stealth nerf or bug. There are people who're saying this might not be a nerf because it might not be intended. I'm just pointing out that those people are wrong. A nerf is a nerf, be it intended, bug or hidden.
---
ROFL, kid things I'm a dude. Run along child, it is obvious you have no clue what you are talking about. You claimed multiple times that they could hotfix the servers without bringing them down even after I linked you the bethesdas offical reddit account stating they can't.
---
Then you try to act like "oh you never datamined anything or know how the servers work" which is utter BS, as I've datamined the game on multiple patch days, and have been working on a server emulation software to run private servers of this game since right after beta. 
---
So, now lets see, here. You were wrong about hot fixes, wrong about how the atom shop works (if you knew how it worked you wouldn't have brought it up unless you weren't aware it has nothing to do with the servers running on amazons cloud servers). 
---
You make the assumption I'm a young male, even though I'm probably old enough to be your mother, and definitely have far more knowledge in how the servers work for this game.
---
Now if you want to continue to show your ignorance, by all means keep looking like a dumb ass. My friends and I are having a good laugh at you on our teamspeak server as you type this. So thank you from the 7 of us for the laughs, your ignorance was hilarious.
---
Can you show us the pictures of it ? thanks !
---
Just take the holotape off the brotherhood member should start the quest
---
SBQ level? Nah. I'd say like half that intense
---
Roadmap says release of April 16th for the camera, unless I missed an ITV that says it was getting delayed
---
Oh. Yeah I wouldnt be surprised if they either added the challenges early on purpose or on accident.
---
Well enjoy your wings pose and soft toy bunny.
---
I also can't apply most mods
---
Sounds like that military training and target practice was wasted on you. 1 shot 1 kill, no need to spray lead on that range.
---
Submit it to mods as a Bethesda please topic. I would but I‚Äôm on my phone on lunch break lol
---
They said the camera isn't quite read and it's coming next month. :o
---
Any one know what the challenge is to complete?
---
First off, there‚Äôs no need to get your panties in a wad. Secondly, some people prefer to get answers from people instead of the internet because people can give a straightforward answer to a question without lines and lines of exposition and other stuff. Asking an actual person, even if it‚Äôs over the internet, is much better than going through google for answers. It‚Äôs not lazy to want to talk to people rather than surf the internet.
---
So why have those perks, weapons and armor in the game.... Why give us that choice..
---
Hey, make a fun build?  Lol.
---
One of the devs posted saying g it's not instanced. I can't find the post but it was called "anyone else excited for the borrows" or something very similar to that
---
Kinda like they claimed the atom shop would be cosmetics only
---
I never heard that shear terror was a timed event , so no more imposter sheep squatch to farm?
---
Try this. 
---
Keep your inventory to reasonable limits. Sure, the strength of your character makes it possible to carry  hundreds of bottles of water... but where would you carry them? Keep your inventory to what would reasonably fit in a 30-40 litre pack.
---
Limit yourself to one melee weapon, one rifle and a sidearm. 
---
Use armour that one could reasonably wear all day.
---
Limit crafting to when you find stations in the world. 
---
If you choose to make one of a few super powered meta builds, which are 100% DESIGNED TO MAKE THE GAME EASY... don't bitch when they make the game easy. It's 100% in your control.
---
Thank you! Would've totally missed that. Upvoted
---
Yeah, it's just garbled yellow dots. When you have over it in build mode it looks fine, but no friend of mine would feel welcomed!
---
It's all bs that luck or charisma helps. I've got better loot on my character with 1 charisma and 5 luck than my other character with 15 in each
---
ESO has a lot of pluses that would work well in 76! I‚Äôm wondering if they‚Äôll have a Fallout 76 Plus like ESO plus?
---
It was probably an accident, just wanted to bring it up so they can fix it.
---
no fixes? really. what is the logic of introducing new content if your game is falling apart. u/Valseek let me put a hardened receiver on my lever action, ffs. why all of a sudden has this ability been taken away from us&gt;?
---
Thanks, that's all I needed.
---
No but she can get in touch with the folks in charge of us and let us know what action will be taken.
---
They might as well made another world boss. I knew they were going to f this up.
---
Really
---
To be fairrrrr
---
They aren‚Äôt meant to be god rolls. Too easy to get. They‚Äôre meant to be achieveable solid legendaries for all the ‚ÄúI‚Äôve played 130 hours and all I‚Äôve found is a stalker‚Äôs lead pipe‚Äù folks.
---
Fair enough. Both wrong though, I'm from Manchester, England.
---
Am I not allowed to say no?
---
He asked, I refused, then he breaks in, and gets killed for the action, but then proceeds to attack me on respawning, just because he didn't get the answer he wanted? That's hardly appropriate.
---
really ?
---
Is the holotape inside the manhole?
---
"They released easter things for easter, fuck bethesda"
---
Ahhh, must have missed that line in the ITV.  My mistake
---
Any good loot?
---
Ya same what was that even
---
There is an ammo workshop to the north east. It makes ammo
---
 I witnessed this holy crap
---
I‚Äôve been able to leave the grounds, enter sneak until my status is ‚Äúhidden‚Äù and then turn around and go back.
---
üòÇ
---
Really? Maybe I‚Äôm just more used to those. Familiarity makes it less chaotic. This Encryptid event was so chaotic, but I guess I‚Äôll figure them out the more I join in. 
---
Again, thank you for the explanations. :)
---
I have said it before and maybe someone else has also but add a new location to the map that is an old storage unit place and maybe have it so robots have maintained it, and everybody can find the location and go there and we each get a "unit" and that is our transfer item storage.
---
Control yourself, boy. You chose to use them all and make yourself super powerful. Didn't have to. Most cars will do 180 km/h... do you drive everywhere at 180 km/h?  There's 750ml in a bottle of whiskey... do you drink it all at once, because it's there?
---
I've got my Gauss suppressor yesterday, scraped maybe 30+ rifles to get it.
---
Thank you =]
---
That was easily most disappointing event yet.
---
Good lord the stupidity of this post. It was delayed due to technical issues, grow up and get over it.
---
Better with no bugs than to have bugs. Besides we have a new dungeon coming out today.
---
He attacked you because you took the stuff he dropped upon his death. Duh
---
Oh ok thanks, I thought the burrows was coming April 16th
---
The vault has the best of the best, patiently waiting 25 years for reclamation day!
---
How did you get in?
---
I feel sorry for anything that dwelves in the Burrows. There is gonna be 10-20 people at any given time there farming and competing over spawns.
---
Yep same
---
Now that is an opinion I genuinely appreciate. You took the time to understand my point. Thank you.
---
Gotta let us know? Any good loot? Like an always max 3* at the end boss?
---
I will thank them when they manage to get canvas bags out to people
---
Better delayed and actually working rather than have it have issues
---
No man grow up
---
I‚Äôm OOTL, why can‚Äôt mods be added?
---
Yes we were, two weeks ago when they told us. We've moved on and gotten over it because if they need to fix technical issues then they need to fix technical issues, oh well...
---
Here i am stuck on work until friday with no way to log in game :(
---
Yikes.
---
Patience Anakin
---
Can I get on
---
Apparently It will come out today and will be "unlocked" so to say withouth update or server downtime. They just said "later" I think in some Hours but thats gonna be so late that I wont have time to play that late when my shift starts tomorrow early.
---
TL"DR 
---
European Players will play it at the 17th because it will be unlocked at a "later time".
---
Would be great If they told us a time for the new content like the last ones instead of letting us hang midair like this.
---
I live in South Eastern Kentucky, down by Pikeville which is just on the KY/WV border, and though we have a lot of Old Regular Baptists, Pentecostals, Southern Baptists and the likes (Who by religion are very "anti-lgbt") what I've noticed is that when someone in their family comes out it really doesn't change anything. They still love the person, they just don't approve of their "lifestyle" but we tend to overlook it for the most part. I can name nearly every gay person in the surrounding 20 miles (Most of them are pretty flamboyant and obvious) and they may get made fun of for that, being flamboyant that is, but not because they're gay, or lesbian, or bi, or trans (ok maybe trans if we're being honest the whole cross dressing thing doesn't go well for men down here)
---
I'd say absolutely you are more familiar with the sbq fight and know what to expect. Just join the SS event every chance and it becomes easier
---
20 miles is 32.19 km
---
OP must be a kid on a temper tantrum trip....
---
Really? Becasue the gamma gun is the absolute answer to bloodied unyielding builds
---
Just annoys me though, when I click on Tyrone, it shows a fat white guy
---
Sure...
---
Where did I say there would be an outage? I didn't. Keep trying though.
---
chances are there werent any technical issues
---
I thought it was supposed to be a ‚Äúraid that two level 50‚Äôs will have trouble doing.‚Äù
---
I absolutely hated the ESO leveling system. To me, it makes no sense. If everything is always your level and is always scaled to you, what does leveling up even do? When you gear up in ESO, you actually become *less* powerful. Nothing ever feels like a challenge that you had to improve to overcome. 
---
I'm all for enemies spawning anywhere that are your level, but that wasn't really what ESO's system was.
---
If Bethesda copies the ESO system, I'll leave FO76 just like I did ESO.
---
"Great moments are born from great opportunity. And that's what you have here today, boys. That's what you've earned here today. One dungeon. If we loot 'em ten times, we might get a 1* wood chest in nine. But not this dungeon. Not today. Today, we shoot with them. Tonight, we sneak with them. And we shut them down because we can! Today, WE are the greatest Vault dwellers in the world. You were born to be Vault Dwellers. Every one of you. And you were meant to be here today. This is your time. Their time is done. It's over. I'm sick and tired of hearing about what a hard dungeon we got. Screw 'em. This is your time. Now go out there and take it."
---
come on guys. I love all Falloit games but you know full well it will still be broken
---
Does no one double check these things? Latest build needs to be triple if not quadruple checked.
---
probably pretty far since you're going to have a bunch of other people down there with you
---
No. Use search next time.
---
there were no technical issues
---
Says the grown ass man that has spent 100s of hours in a video game and is now whining that his favourite form of playtime is too easy for him.
---
Please. Spare me.
---
This has been asked about previously. Like literally a few posts down from this...
---
Lol people already beat it solo no problem like 10 minutes after it released. Wouldn't doubt if you are done by now. What a let down.
---
Even scorchbeasts run off after taking a few shots. Level them up, level everything up mutha fuck.
---
Do you work for Bethesda?
---
Doesn‚Äôt do anything on ripper or buzz blade
---
&gt;https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1QMBfEfLfsdy3ho9eYMoQ0/inside-the-vault-the-burrows-and-camera-preview
---
&gt;we shared a brief overview of the upcoming new dungeon, The Burrows
---
I have been saying things like this from the beginning. Bethesda has already struck gold with TESO, so why can't they take ideas from it and bring them over to FO76? Haven't they ever heard the saying, "Stick with what works?" Ideas like dungeons; unlimited currencey; ability to set up shops; ability to paint any armor/clothing any color; pets; mounts; just anything that works withbone game, why not incorporate those ideas into another game from the get go, knowing they work with their other games? Even FO4 has so much more to offer than FO76 with the ability to have companions, move and decorate with junk items, ammo; stimpacks; fusion cores that all weigh nothing, and even the ability to have a lover. Did they think people wouldn't want that same thing with their newest game? What it feels like to me is that they rushed to put the game on the market to hurry up and start making money off it before fixing it up so that they can charge us for the DLC, which thankfully they haven't done yet, but we all know it's just a matter of time. Once they get the game to where people are comfortable with it and not complaining as much, they'll start launcing DLC after DLC like they do with TESO. Just hopefully by then it'll be worth it.
---
How short is itüòê
---
Is it instanced or do you share with all players on the server?
---
If you approach some groups of scorched, you'll notice they're just standing/laying in some random position. Check out Camden Park, and sneak your way toward the front gates from the parking lot: You'll encounter a group of scorched posed (standing, laying down, crouched,, etc.) amongst several petrified ones.
---
So...they added 1 more location?
---
Holy shit in starting to think it‚Äôs just a joke now hah.
---
All these replies so soon. Anyone would think I've just yelled, "call, call for Mr Patel!".
---
That's a bit unnecessary
---
Would help if we could actually display our character name ...
---
i know a guy who knows a guy who works for bethesda. dont be stupid.
---
they've told us it wasn't instanced some time ago.
---
Yeah, I think my uncle (according to my dad when I called him last night) had some other longstanding issues with the family. 
---
Though I am trans, so...
---
Was there a reward for beating it, or do you have to hope there is a legendary at the end?
---
You sound like an entitled baby. Grow up and realize the delay is so we get a properly working and completed functions. 
---
Too much shit is dropped when it‚Äôs clearly not ready and not fully tested. Delays suck, but at the end of the day they are reinforcing better behaviors of delivery and communication.
---
Same here, i'm about to choke someone at work and just start yelling "The burrows quest is too short"
---
Thanks for the source. Wait...
---
He is on Grafton Day.
---
He also reliably spawns up by the golf course.
---
Ask a partner or friend maybe?
---
I had a couple of 3* lvl 62 charred ghouls. One dropped a 3* gun and the other a 2* leather arm..
---
The crouched speed is amazing, huh
---
You can see my misunderstanding with the way they hyped this up.
---
Got a source for that?
---
Isn't shear terror permanent? It doesn't end. It's now just a questline and an event within the game
---
Well shut up then, whining on Reddit won't help
---
Nope sadly
---
wow wtf man why did you type a paragraph im not reading that
---
Player Vending....coming to the Atom Shop soon!
---
Painfully in my opinion
---
Yeah, that's not what tire swings are for.
---
NoT fOr mE
---
Oh, I see. That doesn't matter as much to me. I can always repair. I'm so sick of not having good weapons or armor. You'd think by level 60 something I'd have found something.
---
Aww really that was what i was looking forward to. Didn't really care about the burrows
---
I still want to know what happens when you are maxed caps and someone buys things from the vending machine.
---
Am I incorrect? Does the engine charge Bethesda per line of code they write? Does it cost them money to implement the changes in each fix? If anything they save money by having the servers down. They do it at times that the least amount of people play, and you‚Äôd be surprised what little money they make from the Atom shop aside from peak activity hours. Do the employees have to give Todd money out of their pocket for changing his already perfect, all newly rendered, fallout game that has sixteen times the detail, just out of respect for feeling they needed to fix something that clearly ‚Äújust worked‚Äù?
---
Anytime. Us Vault Dwellers gotta stick together! Haha
---
Well that sucks. 
---
If you‚Äôd like me to mod it, shoot me a PM. I‚Äôm on Xbox as well.
---
Oh yeah, based on the wave of posts expressing disappointment it seems to be a general theme that people were expecting more. 
---
I am at work for several more hours so I can't get my own impressions yet.
---
I haven't actually you cunt. Thus the reason I'm only level 135 since the game was released... M m m mong.
---
P.S my favorite playtime is watching your hooker mum pull pubes out of her teeth.
---
Nice spoiler tag mate.
---
Wait it opens today?
---
yep add me on discord schmeat #4669 and I'll send it to you
---
I haven't played it yet, but it's pretty much what I expected based on what I'm seeing here. Bethesda are the kings of hype.  
---
Honestly, I thought the sheepsquatch event was underwhelming too.
---
Cough *BS* cough
---
Yet you bothered to reply to it?  Are you stupid or just dumb?
---
Share it, a group ran in a killed the boss while I was reading a terminal but besides that there wasn‚Äôt much loot or any legendaries
---
why would you not instance it....
---
I got a named assaultron blade. The enemy at the end had a crown so it can spawn legendary.
---
Yea I dont think that's the end...
---
Um yeah, yeah it would. It would add the ability to, you know. Look at your pip boy while sitting down.
---
Just because you wouldn't use it doesn't mean other people wouldn't.
---
You‚Äôll be feeling the pain like the rest of us soon friend.
---
Yeahhhh I get that. If you're roleplaying, it's kind of a bummer
---
3000 atoms
---
You break in, you pay the price, you attack me as soon as you respawn, you die. Don't like being told no? Don't expect me to say yes because it's what you want me to say. But to return with an ally and proceed to attack me, again? That's harassment.
---
So if I can solo the queen and sheep I'm going just be able to fart and kill everything? I'm sad now
---
It means suck it trebeck
---
You have to kill 50 of each different enemy types in survival mode
---
Post it here
---
3rd post about this already.
---
Salty kid is really having a temper tantrum today
---
I'm not a big fan of suggestion #1 because it makes you feel like you aren't personally progressing or getting stronger. A level 10 with their strongest weapon hits an enemy 5 times and kills it, then a level 100 with their strongest weapon hits an enemy 5 times and kills it. Why do we even have levels and higher damage weapons? The only progression is that every time you level up you actually get weaker because now enemies are leveled to that new number and you have to get stronger weapons just to get to the what you used to do. 
---
I'd prefer a leveled section in each region, like mini blast zones. Maybe a legendary roving super glowing enemy(similar to how the hordes work) is causing their local area to mutate, raising the local enemy level and spawning special enemies. Taking them out will be a challenge but it'll reward you with a 3\* Legendary from the Mini-Boss and you'll get Event Rewards as well. Once one dies another appears in another random region within 10-15 minutes(allowing people to prepare, repair and restock).
---
Not instanced ? That sucks. Won't be fun , I had planned on throwing nuka grenades like Mardi Gras beads . Nowhere I can ever do that because it's not fair to other players trying to get hits. All they get to do is kill bs enemies that no one is around to complain about not getting loot. I just want to blow up every thing I see moving.
---
I did it solo too man. And I don't have a good build. Lol
---
Troll or no troll. This should have been implemented back in beta. Destroys immersion and compromises security.
---
my bad dude. i didnt even think about it. i deleted the post.
---
&gt; TL:DR - Making something just weaker (not weak) isnt a nerf
---
No, that's definitely nerfing it.
---
No. Post it here or gtfo.
---
Aww. THAT's the way to prove your superior maturity.
---
You keep doing you, son. You charming motherfucker, you.
---
I was armed to the teeth for no reason
---
Burrows is a complete let down. Its not even a dungeon. What happened to it being instanced? üò≠üò≠
---
Took 15mins to complete. üò≠üò≠
---
Any evidence to back this?
---
Damn, so much hype for nothing. Very upsetting
---
Any effects on the blade?
---
Trans women going male isn't really an issue, but the good ol' boys find it weird when a guy who clearly can't afford the transition is walking around in a dress looking like a guy, you see a woman with short hair and mens clothing and its just an ahhh whatever, but there's a shock factor when you see another man walking around in a sphagetti strap top and cutoff jean shorts.
---
good questrion....
---
Player vending....coming to the Atom Shop soon!
---
wow are you stalking me stop harassing me wtf
---
What happens if you go back in?
---
nope
---
that's it.
---
Yeah, just got confirmation elsewhere in this post as well. Too bad!
---
I hope we're all just missing something ..it has to be :P
---
add me on discord schmeat #4669 and ill send u proof
---
stop harassing me
---
The important part is doing what I can to make sure that it doesn't happen to other people with this same guy.
---
I know it happens, but I'll do my best to at least spread the names of those who do it to at least alleviate it, if only a bit.
---
Like 5-10 minutes max.
---
How many unique items are in Ark compared to this?
---
Stop spreading all of theses bs posts on here
---
stop harassing me on my posts
---
If you can solo non-nuked whitesprings you can solo this thing...
---
The Mire is always where I go when I get bored and need some fresh action.  Great story!
---
Thanks for waiting guys your 15 minutes of killing some normal monsters in a sewer is here, and as a surprise we are proud to announce our entire game is in the sewers now!
---
If only they worked in dungeonsüíî
---
It got removed by mods because he's a troll.
---
It took me and 2 others 25 minutes to do it and that was looking just about everywhere. Going to do a deeper look through when I get back home. Was fun and cool the rewards where alright. Definitely will be doing more
---
I get'cha. Different timezones though means players can miss this easily, whatever the item on the 7th day turns out to be.
---
Yeh and? It's a bit of fun kid. I'll keep glazing your mums ass like a fuckin donut.
---
Yeh my replies are more than immature but there's a reason for that. You lack understanding of my post completely, and just go in because you've got a 100k game score and think your thee gamer. Rather than to look at it and go yeh I understand but at the same time... Because you son, are a fucking bum nugget.
---
P. S Your dad is your uncle Pete.
---
*wipes eyes* thanks man
---
Yup. His friend wasn't a shitty person though. But won't lie, after the worst morning. It kind of broke me a bit. All rise was my favorite weapon. As dull as it may be.
---
Good, thanks for the heads up
---
Well shit...
---
Hmmm
---
If the Burrows is any indication, you're going to need AT LEAST wood armor and a pipe wrench. Maybe even a radaway.
---
Either, both are great
---
I still think that they left only 3 people to develop what is left of fallout 76
---
Have you tried replaying it, maybe the difficulty increases after the initial quest?
---
This might've been me, did you eat them near a bridge
---
stop being a spamming piss baby
---
Throne room, can‚Äôt remember where that is tho.
---
bethesda-style) 
---
i got worried they'll start to make good and challanging content after not so bad sheepsquatch questline and event, but seems here is old good bethesda with pointless bit of boring content))
---
In the throne room
---
I‚Äôve been waiting for an opportunity to raid something. This will do.
---
Sigh and here I gathered 15k rounds of 556 and 45 expecting something hard.
---
 "The Burrows is balanced to be a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault Dwellers, but truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone. "  The whitesprings resort is more of a challenge. flat out.  
---
They promised more end game content then pushed it back. Then delivered this.  Its disappointing because its a cool area; thats as empty as the rest the map.
---
Yeh I'm not wasting my time with it , not at all what I was hoping for. How can it be a challenge with so much player traffic. I guess the only way to get a challenge is to see how long one can stay on a server without a ctd or dc.
---
They hyped it by saying it was a dungeon that was tuned for 2+ lvl 50+ players where you can get great loot and experience. It is none of that, it's not even 10 minutes of content solo.
---
Better is. E working, than it eating all your stuff you out into in.
---
You can only do quest once. The dungeon just stays ghouled out. Idek if the ‚Äúboss‚Äù comes back.
---
This needs to be hotfixed. 50 atom points are unavailable then. 20 atom points I now miss due to the increased RNG of the daily challenges but this is just irritating.
---
I‚Äôll hit you up later
---
That's not harassment bruv
---
Yeah, like a 100 pound (shit even like 50 pound would be fine) "account stash" specifically for transferring items across characters.
---
It's actually both. You get a flat 25% damage boost but it's split across two projectiles. This seems to work in the same way as shotguns: First the game checks how many projectiles hit, then adds up the damage, then applies the damage formula. Hence the damage results for a two-projectile hit look the same as a single 125% damage projectile.
---
So two-shot is better than AA if you hit with both projectiles, and much worse if you hit with one. Two-shot has an aim cone radius multiplier of 250%, so you should never hipfire with it, and long-range or head shots may be tricky to land.
---
Note that shotguns only add one pellet (so typically 8-&gt;9) but with the same +25% overall damage bonus, so the damage per pellet is actually higher. However, it's far more difficult to get the pellets on target.
---
Just soloed it in 10 minutes with a crappy quad lvl 35 lever gun. It's a joke... As hard as whitesprings, the regular one not nuked ws
---
You can have a flaming samurai sword, which isn't quite as awesome, but still not bad.
---
I'm not disparaging them, I like the uniques. All I was saying is that collecting them all is almost impossible with limited stash space.
---
I wouldn't worry too much. Everyone will find a new thing to be mad about before then.
---
Oneshoting everyone at the event is not PvP.
---
i've informed a moderator
---
I'm in college atm
---
I‚Äôd go as far to say bring a pipe pistol if you want to be triple OP.
---
I think you give them too much credit.
---
I totally agree with you though, but that's why I posted, so as many people can get it as possible.
---
Try two of six weeklies for 50 atom points. If you play the game and save up atoms this way, you would also be disapproving.
---
Which direction from the door is that
---
Did it in ~10 minutes after i serverhopped to get the quest.
---
Used a shitty level 35 quad lever action rifle...
---
It opened 45 minutes ago
---
Left
---
So I claimed the egg...But I cant find it in the build menu anywhere, am I blind? Or am I missing a step somewhere?
---
wow wtf stop harassing me you comment on all my posts im informing a moderator of your actions
---
üè≥
---
Lol sounds like a legendary run on watoga might have a better payoff
---
it is all of that, though.
---
it's not Bethesdas fault that you blazed through it at more than double the level required
---
Well when people post 'no patch or downtime today' without bothering to mention that the dungeon still goes live, people are going to ask if the dungeon goes live or not.  So quit your bitching.
---
How do I start it
---
yeah I think perhaps the end-of-dungeon steamer trunk is what will make people come back, I got a t-45 blue lamp mod, something tells me other much cooler can drop from it. Fingers crossed! :)
---
Division even had that right? I want to say stash was cross character in that. Destiny's vault is just account wide by default. Heck, you're more hard pressed to find games that don't offer that than you are to find games that do.
---
His loss my gain, don't be an a-hole if you can't handle the penalty.
---
Legit tempted to do a bare fist run.
---
It‚Äôs really that easy? I‚Äôm so disappointed, I got into endgame gear just for the burrows and future vault raids.
---
The only place I check for 'uploaded' codes to Nukacrypt is my own discord, so merely a coincidence, as you said.
---
Also, linking the page on how to decipher the code when no letters are on the board is rather useless. Without any letters there can be 1000+ solutions, so trying to manually find and attempt 1k+ isnt feasible. 
---
It just seems kinda odd that you used my code solver to decipher the codes and then link a manual way to do it, which would be impossible to do until tomorrow when the letters show up.
---
Enjoy your ban!
---
I'm level 147 still nothing on a good weapon or armor.  Running with mostly 1star things but yeah that's RNG for  you.
---
Are you really expecting them to deploy something without issues at this point?
---
This. Bethesda, are you listening? ü§©
---
Wouldn't that basicslly be making the game P2W? I mean, I'm all for it to a degree, but from what I hear they said they would never make FO76 like that. I can see msybe doing things lime giving Plus members more stash space, weightless ammo (like with their other games), and maybe even certain beneficial perks, but nothing that would allow them to gain a massive advantage over other players like weapons and armor you can only get by buying them.
---
So then... change the timer. Come on, buddy.
---
shame really
---
hehe, I uh ..I'm walking through here again now, and after reading others' comments as well I uh ..fear you might be right :P But I've dedicated my evening to prove myself wrong, wish me luck! :P
---
That reminds me, their what's new atomic store menu is all well and good but their timers should be correct. When it says 1 day remaining it isn't 24 hours, but 1 day and 24 hours if I recall. Which is confusing.
---
Probably but which would be worse.  That they didn't care or that they ACTUALLY forgot to change something.   I think the latter is potentially worse
---
whomp fucking whomp.   
---
Dont waste your time. Less density of ghouls than the whitesprings.  Maybe a few more, but theyre way spread out.
---
But why? It‚Äôs not even a QoL addition. It literally adds nothing to the game except you may like the concept of over people seeing you use a pip-boy. 
---
So, uh, they could use that time to uh program actual patches to uh ya know fix the game?
---
Show me on the doll where they hurt you
---
Me and two others happened to check it out at the same time and now we're just standing around wondering what the hell that even was supposed to be and if we missed something. It's a cool area but seems completely wasted
---
It's like wearing a blindfold and throwing a dart at a dartboard while in a room full of people.
---
they didn't really hype it though.
---
people here hyped it to hell and back, though.
---
I ran into him again when farming a random encounter spot and he died before he could say anything. Rip.
---
It's not a boulder, it's a rock!
---
Finished as well. 1 boss assaultron and a new sword. That can't be it. Non nuked whitesprings is harder.
---
I‚Äôm guessing a lvl 100 killed this lower level guy?
---
Yeah let‚Äôs hope. There better be some more loot for this are people are going to be disappointed. I didn‚Äôt get anything from it that was good so lets hope round 2 will be better.
---
All this hype this pep talk this drama... and I already finished the dungeon in 5 min solo...
---
Fucking millennials. Why cant you just be in the moment
---
TLDR:
---
If you‚Äôre better than me you‚Äôre a no life. If I‚Äôm better than you you‚Äôre a noob
---
Drop a nuke on it? Maybe it's meant to be the ideal farming spot. It's all max level stuff, yes?
---
FUCKING WEST TEK IS HARDER AND ITS NOT EVEN A DUNGEON
---
It sucked
---
Power armor frames are also bugged.

---
No , its bad stop defending it, i could have done it at level 50 easily.
---
They need to add the fallout 4 survival mechanics, hands down.
---
Fair point. Nobody actually has any complete picture of how it's all handled both from the server and local sides of things. That was just my initial speculation when I noticed the difference at Watoga.
---
At least!
---
I cant lie haven't read the lore into but you know you did something wrong with the quest when I still dont ow what the mysterious signal is
---
My thoughts exactly. The area is awesome, really well done but the quest is a joke. A couple of others were in there at the same time who killed the "boss" just as I entered that room and the quest finished and I'm like wtf? That it? Wow.
---
rifleman.
---
Judging by the numerous new posts flowing in.  The dungeon is an absolute flop and disappointment. I won‚Äôt play it till this evening.  But initial reviews by players is very disheartening.
---
Yea, the burrows is horrible, it adds a single mission that takes 5 minutes to do and the reward is a shitty assault assualtron blade
---
Can also agree. While gathering junk one can already explore different routes without fast traveling. In regards to legendary farming I would say the main issue is Whitesprings. As far as I know Bethesda already lowered the drop rates because of Whitesprings instead of lowering the amount of legendary minions in Whitespring.
---
Yes, I realize I didn‚Äôt even put that in there. Wow.
---
Update: it's super easy. Recommended that you do it solo.

Ya but if you dont have caps to contest than how can i go in and kill him if he had a bounty that will help me claim a workshop?
---
Why can't we just tame scorchbeasts give them industrial laxatives and have them place their arse into the sewers and go full bore?
---
Sweet. Thanks!
---
I need to get those extractor plans. I assume you get them from a workshop event. Going to have to look it up. I have been relying on junk runs, but that is not keeping up anymore.
---
I got 3* quad and beserker crossbow
---
You're right, they clearly delayed it because "fuck the players"
---
do it then.
---
Solo and 1 stimpack. Seriously? I have to be missing something....
---
I got pretty excited going into the pipe hatch and dropping down into water. Finally, the real entrance! Glad I put on aquaboy! Except it was the exit and I was done.
---
I could
---
This is wrong, adrenal was a nerf, they changed the damage table it uses and in the process broke the mutation.  Their fix was to revert the change, it was absolutely intended to be a nerf.  You should go back and recheck your information rather than spreading disinformation.
---
Holy shit really? What's even said is last week during the event when they announced it and we're talking about it, they said how much work they put into it and how awesome it looked........ they are a joke
---
I don't know, I never played the division. I am not a fan of console games. But yeah, it blows me away that bethesda thoughts "oh we don't need this" even though it is something badly needed and would help their server instability.
---
The server issues is people having too much crap on them and in their stash, if they were to offer a "account stash" that was saved outside of the server and could have to go into an instanced area to access it. That would remove a large amount of the instability due to people having too much items on them for the servers to handle.
---
I'm not very good at this but to see my post the first one on this sub about clearing it solo was kind of depressing tbh lol
---
back in my days it was XxSephirothxX
---
Dont worry, as soon as they see this is total super useless place, they will leave it and never return.
---
the game is also still bugged and doesn't allow you to attach mods so even if we did have the camera we would not be able to attach a lens
---
Thank God i had the Chance to do it once on my own now.
---
No. When I sit down I lose all cognitive abilities to do anything but sit.
---
It's about playing solo and having legendary drops hidden behind multiplayer events.
---
What are you whining about?
---
Not even worth doing it
---
go on then
---
You get this to work on non Sony Android phones though
---
Saw folks on Twitch finish it in 15 minutes...course they played in a group.
---
Survival mode - spam BOUGHT repair kits while PVP to repair armor and weapons when in multiple fights.
---
Who hurt you?
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I can give you all the resources to rebuild.
---
interesting, perhaps this is the answer :) It's all lvl 62 in here though yeah, thankfully. Except for the last boss/mob which surprised me a bit, I'm well up in the levels as well so I don't think anyone was in there to bring it's level down. But hey it's all very early on so I dare not draw any conclusions yet. I'm pretty sure someone will nuke the place very soon ..for science, of course! Hehe :)
---
Oh yeah, I saw plenty of those in vanilla WoW, alongside xxxleglolas420xxx and the like.
---
Not really, I won an ESO deal for a year and you get access to all the DLC's, storage is unlimited for crafting materials to an extent however you are very limited on items you can hold which includes armor, weapons and all that.   
---
It does give you a little more XP and gold earnings but like 10% I think.  
---
They would need to come up with 2 different stash boxes if they went that route since junk even bulked adds up to the 800. So not sure how that would work.   
---
I don't think ESO Plus is a real advantage to play the game other than storage space to be honest and there's no advantage over other players really since you can't damage anyone at all unless they accept a challenge to duel from you at the same time you also don't get any ++ from ESO in that regards even with NPC enemies.
---
fingers crossed! :)
---
Would love to find a vamps buzz blade. Furious and bloody versions are bonkers.
---
well that's disappointing.
---
Oh who am I kidding? We're all going to diiiie!
---
If that is it.....what a huge letdown....
---
I didn‚Äôt know it was live yet.

It was my Fallout76Custom.ini at fault. Thanks again for the reminder.

Are you guys going to fix the challenges so that they are challenges that are actually attainable in game, or do you guys plan on just leaving them like it is?
---
go ahead. I'm sure more people have reported you for being a spammer than your one report of me responding to your spam.
---
Would you be willing to sell them, if so how much
---
take away the + on the 50 and it would be more accurate.
---
Ye, we are disaponted again. We need walls of text so bethesda see, that they can't give us trash content.
---
So.... the burrows somehow a bigger disappointment than anything else in this game? Like seriously, wtf?
---
He wasn't being an asshole but go off I guess
---
ah good ol vanilla wow, i'll never forget those two night elves in the station and that curious dwarf lol. I played from phase 2 beta to cataclysm
---
yeahhh heh I'm feeling the same way. I am hoping that the devs are sitting in their office looking at many monitors, checking if anyone finds the hidden ultra-secret at the end :P Atleast that's what I like to think ..oh god I hope this is the case :P
---
So a bloodied handmade and smg is over kill? Well I guess a fork will do then
---
yep one shotted the final boss.
---
Dissapointed
---
You mean... the thing they made as the big bonus for fo4?
---
Dwarf alpha (10/2003) until shortly into BFA here. What a ride.
---
The atom shop event
---
Assuming from the posts it is.
---
Ah ok, I have the game on PS4 and Xbox but mainly stick to Playstation. I'm ok not getting the best gear or guns in the game every time I play the queen, or sheepsquash or down a 3 star out in the world enemy. But the queen is still broken, last 5 times I pmayed against her at one point she litrally stopped taking damage at all. Couple times she just flew out of the map area. Last time she wouldnt land once and the drops are atrocious. Going through 5k prime 50 cal or other prime weapons to get a wooden leg armour l, or over 15 times now beating the sheepsquash for 14 fedoras and 1 costume head and 1 star do nothing weapons? That is beyond needing to be adressed. ....I'll come off my soapbox now
---
Yeah, but its really easy , only takes like 15 minutes
---
I mean with many of us in the 100+ range it'll be a breeze with more legendaries and maxed perks. The nuke silos are supposed to be hard too but .... Ya know
---
Where is the sword?
---
Better be. Where is that diving suit we saw on the sneak peak? 
---
Maybe there is water we need to swim through??
---
Yeah, I finished the quest literally after just walking to it,  killing maybe four or five Mr Gutsy and an Assaultron Dominator, which I assume was intended to be the boss. Got a headlamp mod and a unique weapon, along with much confusion and dissapointment?
---
No it is not. Balancing a weapon is not the same as nerfing it.
---
Levels don't mean shit, all depends on what legendary effects your gear is rocking.
---
You don't need plans. Just plop your CAMP down and whatever resources are available within your radius area available to build. Lead extractor requires 10 power.
---
Side note: if you're a junk junkie *and* want lead. there's [a spot just for you](https://fo76map.com?locationIds=2008,2190) in the Toxic Valley. The one spot on the map where you can put a lead extractor **and** junk extractor in the same camp.
---
oof thats a lot
---
Whitesprings 2.0
---
Those aren't patch notes
---
Reward for quest completion.
---
It is mainly due to the fact there aren't many "live servers" as there used to be, they have closed a lot of their servers due to how few players there are for the game.
---
the tarren mill vs southshore days were the best when the honor system came out.
---
Jokes aside this is probably why we can't
---
Based on the description of charisma, it only affects your loot drops when you're on a team. So team up with somebody next time you nuke the whitespring and see if you get better loot.
---
I will say this after leaving the content and going back in the enemies do respawns so there is replayability I just thought there would be a bigger challenge than a 5 min tour under Harper ferry
---
 My quest finished one minute into the dungeonBy somebody who must have been ahead of me.
---
I was completely lost and clueless as to where to go or what to do. 
---
 Another half assed thing thrown at us by these lazy a** developers
---
Well yes its should stay the same way, but if you toggle the pip boy then its should pull up fullscreen. I get what you're saying but adding the pip boy shouldn't remove the OG stuff
---
It wouldn't be reliable. The game's undocumented, bugged to hell, and a lot of the legendary combinations are too expensive to acquire for testing.
---
Well its free so its not going to be the greatest. The moment people should be mad is when we have to pay for a dlc and its crap. Free content is just that, free. All i really care about is the long awaited player vending anyway
---
And the more reports there are the more attention it will get from Bethesda.
---
Or grinding 24 hour AVs...
---
There are two entrances the other is where the other player is in the map
---
now i regret looking at this post i cant focus for the rest of my day lol
---
I'm honestly thinking this is just the difference between the "average" player and a good player.
---
Like you take two random players at level 50 who have no idea how to play a fallout game, and sure it's probably a bit of a challenge for them.
---
You take anyone who's spent a little time with the mechanics and has a generally good build, and they basically walk through it like it's nothing.
---
Fear of duping? Not realizing how quickly people will reach cap limit and have no where to go?
---
haha it was amazing to do like 5 hours in a av, come back the next day and the SAME GAME is still going
---
trash  , i get a assaultron blade
---
Lmao somone died
---
Harper's Ferry in a sewer
---
Reading all other posts, not going to waste resources on this crap.
---
Legendary? Or just a normal blade? O.o
---
90% reduced weight Stalkers rolling pin
---
Took me 4 minutes solo lol. Didn't even lose a fraction of my health.
---
Alright that makes sense I suppose. Thanks.
---
Yeah, that's the issue. Like you have to remember that each instance of a gun would need to be its own unique item in this due to variable durability and legendary affixes and mods. 
---
Like even if Ark has durability (haven't played it) it's probably the only variable so you could store items kind of as a database of arrays. For example say you have 3 of a type of gun. If durability is only variable on "gun" then you could just store it as like "item1" = [gunIDNumber], item1Durability = {0.85, 0.4, 0.3}.
---
For Fallout you have to track an item id, max durability, and current durability (to save data tracking lets hope that each mod combination is a unique ID, so like stock "gun" would be like ID = "weapon000" where stock gun with glow sight is "weapon010" and maybe stock gun with suppressor is "weapon001" while like stock knife is "weapon100").
---
All that aside, it would be nice if like "staple" items wouldn't count against storage weight. I mean staple as in basic materials like raw wood and such.
---
Camera isn't coming out for atleast a week, next tuesday at the earliest.
---
Imma be honest chief, spoiler or not, the new ‚Äùdungeon‚Äù is bad and they need to see our thoughts on it.
---
Same.
---
Don't even bother it took me 20mins. But if you really want too go to harpers ferry and go towards the armoury there will be too new markers
---
That sounds like a pretty fun farming weapon.
---
Oh wow I'm stupid I didn't even notice it when I got it xD
---
Yes I will and good riddance.
---
Hopefully you didn't get your hopes up too much.....what a dud.
---
I hope they get rid of PvP and multiplayer altogether and just go ahead and call the game Fallout 5 like they should have done from the get go.
---
I'm 152 and rarely engage in pvp. I've been griefed and picked on as a lower level.  Welcome to MMOs thoght cuz you seem new to them. Don't shoot back and it becomes super hard to kill you.  Orbits strikes won't do it so. ...
---
Nope, cameras aren't coming out til next tuesday at the earliest unless they get pushed back again.
---
Nerfing can be balancing, as was in the case of the TSE. Like you said, it's still one of the strongest weapon combo's available, but it was absolutely nerfed.
---
Yeah, I can't even get all the 1 star items I want. I've been looking for an unyielding left leg trapper (ideally) or leather armor for ages, still running around with one dumb looking wood armor leg...
---
in my case. legendary with a bad effect
---
I have a furious crossbow 1* for like 200c
---
Yet here you are talking about this game , the only thing more disappointing than this dungeon seems to be the use of your free time
---
* 0.5
---
It's not free though it's being funded by the purchases people make in the atom shop.
---
I understand having s limit on items you can carry. TESO does that as well, yes. But yeah, as you mentioned, TESO has a whole new item that allows you to store your crafting items separate from your carried items. That would be awesome to have in FO76, a separate stash nox as you mentioned. Good idea.
---
Thanks for your reports, we're looking into this. These challenges aren't intended to be available at the moment, and we still plan to release the Camera [next week](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1QMBfEfLfsdy3ho9eYMoQ0/inside-the-vault-the-burrows-and-camera-preview).
---
The latest ITV did say they were delaying the camera so I don't think it was released today.
---
It took me longer to read your post than it did to finish the quest
---
Yup attaching mods are broken across things - I have an X01 Targeting HUD for my 2nd character that I can‚Äôt attach right now.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm missing them. I‚Äôve been searching for a review. I know I was playing the game 10 minutes ago and it didn‚Äôt appear to be love. Also a moderator responded that it would be up in a couple of hours an hour ago.
---
Below 0/10
---
 Thought maybe this was going to be something I'll be able to spend a little time on exploring and killing stuff.
---
Wrong.
---
 Glad I got excited for that 5 minutes of content we just got handed. Jokes on us yet again.
---
 I swear Bethesda is trying to play vault tec and do an experiment on its playerbase.
---
Atomic shop update. Great, that‚Äôs what we really want Bethesda.
---
What a joke the burrows, not worth going there
---

---
 &gt; Thanks for your reports, we're looking into this. These challenges aren't intended to be available at the moment, and we still plan to release the Cam...
---
I was excited at first but that lead to disappointment
---
Source?
---
Pretty sure I check ever secret passageway. They all lead to places I've already been. There is one underwater passageway that's accessed through the boss room. You open up a sewer pipe to the right of the terminal.
---
It's not "free". I purchased this game because I was explicitly told there would be future content added.
---
Seems like a pretty glaring oversight. All one needs to do is log into the game and check the challenges, which is now just a couple button presses. No major playtesting is really involved. 
---
If they aren't even logging into their game from time to time, how confident can we really be in their capacity to find and squash bugs prior to distribution?
---
Already done.
---
grandpa spambot, is that you? is it really you?
---
I don't even care about the rewards I just wish it was a lot longer and a lot harder... I soloed this in about 5 or 10 minutes while trying to take my time :l
---
Are the rewards any good?
---
I honestly hope there is more, otherwise I have very low expectations for Arktos Pharma.
---
The character name means nothing because ot is never displayed
---
We will ride Yao Guai into the sewers and leave none in our wake
---
I agree! I was killing Mirelurks with 2 other high level players in the ‚ÄúSwarm of Suiters Event‚Äù, (no teams). When the event ended, myself and one of the others gave the heart emoji to eachother. I was just about to run away when the third player downed him right beside me! I ran over and tried to revive him with no luck. I had to hide behind a rock(so i wouldnt be sniped) and watch him bleed out. I guarded his junk for a while, but he never came back. 
---
First off, i know its survival and pvp, and always be on guard, but doing an event together and then turning on your fellow wastelander as soon it ends seems kinda rude. Kind of like standing at the train station stash box depositing your stuff, just to have someone stab you in the back while youre defenceless! Yes this happened to me in watoga. Luckily i dodged his attacks and backed out from the stash box in time to kill the cowardly backstabber. Is there no decency in Survival mode????
---
Am i the only one who feels that if you come across another player with their head in their stash box, or in the middle of selling to a vendor, that you should let them at least finish before engaging them? We arent all roleplaying as Raiders after all.
---
I see they worked hard on this new content.
---
Interesting. 
---
So if we go along the same logic, would you agree that a single projectile versus effect is better than a single projectile anti-armor effect, like the math indicates?
---
Ok... how much was said content? ü§îü§îü§î
---
A 10-minute server wide area does not sound exciting honestly.  The second I read this wasn't instanced I lost nearly all interest.  This isn't some special dungeon - it is just a new area to explore, nothing super special in my opinion.
---
I thought that after I received my 5th instigating rolling pin and my 3rd executioner‚Äôs radium rifle that the system wasn‚Äôt random. But, as it turns out, repetitions with a randomized series is to be expected. Our brains just aren‚Äôt often well-suited to accepting truly random outcomes.
---
Vampires Fat Man!
---
What are their names?
---
Aaaand it was a disappointment.
---
I tried opening one of the doors again or going back by the water, though I couldn't.
---
Not that I lose much ofc cause in the end the "dungeon" was easy to do alone and without much preparation :/
---
You clearly don't sit in game very often if you can't see how it is exactly a QoL addition. 
---
You can't eat or drink while sitting. You can't check to see if you have that thing your buddy asked for while your sitting down. You can't play pip boy games while sitting down. You can't turn on the radio while sitting down. Fairly sure you can't send or accept team invites while sitting down. I was legitimately astounded the other day that you can at least trade while sitting, can't check your inventory, but yeah sure trading, why not...
---
Also I'm not sure if breaking almost as many things as you "fix" is something I look forward to anymore. I'm getting very tired of very obvious things getting broken and not fixed for WEEKS after literally every patch...
---
Can Solo is my real name. (Booo, I know)  I always try everything alone first, and am really excited to try this new content by myself
---
I don't think you were paying attention. I didn't really "farm" the area, but every time I went to visit Phoenix I would check the 5-6 bots in the alley areas behind his shop, and I would almost always find at least 1 legendary. It was usually a crap 1 star, but I found enough decent stuff that it became part of my routine when I was there, and the spawns were consistent enough that I was surprised when I *didn't* see a legendary in the area.
---
Legendary Vendor isn't out until May.
---
It is West Tek challeging level.
---
a challenge, but not a nightmare like the sheepsquatch
---
Before path 7,  I was sitting close to 200bobby pins 
---
Afterward the were frail AF. Breathe on them wrong and they‚Äôd break.
---
I‚Äôm now at or around ~90
---
It was unintentionally broken... And it definitely wasn't a nerf by any stretch of the word. I actually wish they'd put it back so I could hit for 900 with my lever action again.
---
Out of interest, what‚Äôs your opinion now?
---
What level is it?
---
The Grafton monster doesn't even feel like a cryptid like the others, it feels more like the Snallygaster. It's just another enemy in the game that has set spawns, like you always see it down in that big ditch when you go to Charleston.
---
You can name them yourself...
---
Agreed. I love the terrain of the burrows but the challenge just isn't there. If they added some mechanics to the final fight, increased enemy levels and increased the amount of enemies I would have been satisfied. It also would have been cool if we got some kind of unique boss monster.
---
50 I think
---
what I told...it was absolute garbage.
---
This "Doungeon" killed all my hopes for this game XD
---
My first good legendary was a lvl 35 instigating dragon, since then I've gotten far more black powder items than anything else and for a while used mainly a dragon+BPR combo. On the other hand, I've got less than 5 bloodied weapons in total, none more than 1 star.
---
Hitting the enter key twice
---
will put in line breaks
---
so we can read easier.
---
I could not agree more, went in with some random level 250. It was absolute child's play, lack luster, and not even remotely a "dungeon". This is beyond pathetic.
---
The camera has been delayed to next Tuesday April 23 which in a vacuum would be fine, whatever. But considering half the daily and weekly challenges are camera related it's beyond stupid.
---
I appreciate the good positive attitude, Graylord. We need more people like you! Also, I wish I could see pictures of your original CAMP, Frito. It sounds epic and awesome!
---
Good luck doing it solo today.. it is not instanced. Better luck in survival maybe.
---
Thanks for your report, we're looking into this. These Challenges aren't currently intended to be available and we're still planning to release the Camera [next week](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1QMBfEfLfsdy3ho9eYMoQ0/inside-the-vault-the-burrows-and-camera-preview).
---
ugh
---
But the dailys require it.
---
Sheep is easy... Comments like this is why Burrows was easy as well.
---
Man, and you're over double my level... 
---
And I thought Destiny's RNG was bad.
---
Yeah,There was no fun at all doing it...we should have more challenges like the Queen...that was a shame and it just killed my hype as well.
---
Didn't think of that, too bad this post won't get seen though. Been posting a lot about this on the subreddit to get Bethesda's attention :(
---
Bet I‚Äôll give you 200 for it, I‚Äôll be on tonight at like 7:30 eastern time
---
He's on now, been playing over spring break, not sure what he's leveled up to. GT MidnightLunacy
---
I did manage to get him a BOS recon rifle, that was fun sneaking all the way down there from the forest. Lol
---
Thanks all!
---
I waited three hours to play something that took three minutes to complete how bizarre.
---
No , just a shitty melee weapon
---
I play solo (friends have abandoned me and the game) so I won't mind a "group up" location
---
Correct.
---
I have a set of max level unyielding mixed armor minus a right arm... is that any good to you??
---
This gave me a stroke to read.
---
Wait what? The update for burrow have patched?
---
15min I did it in 5.
---
I'm pretty sure that's by design.  One more way to get people to keep logging in y'know
---
I want to say thanks to the random level 140ish guy on PC who was running around Whitesprings car park with me the other day. When we finally came across a legendary ghoul he was kind enough to step aside after shooting once so I could get a shot in too. A Gentleman.
---
It‚Äôs really just ghoul farm. The quest storyline is weak and the rewards even weaker
---
If you have the appropriate build for pve like me you can literally get it done in 5 min solo.  IF you got the gear and skills to compliment it
---
Add me i will give you all rise psn sirrrmichal
---
Tomorrow in the shop
---
Not jumping on the dungeon today for that same reason. Then they'll probably start bitching that its super easy.
---
We can ‚Äúgo back in‚Äù in the sense that when you leave any building you can go back in. So not that wild wasteland really.
---
It is I was pretty shocked after completing it in like 10 mins highest level thing is a level 62 ghoul and there are only a handful of enemies down there in general
---
i like the first texto
---
Yeah I see what you‚Äôre saying. In the BETA before I understood how stash containers worked, I thought the My Stash box was private stash, and other containers were public containers. I thought the 300lb storage limit would force us to put less desirable items into locked public storages allowing thievery. With that idea I was going to have an unlocked container, probably a dumpster, where I‚Äôd put water, food, ammo I didn‚Äôt need, etc for people to take as they needed. Boy was I wrong.
---
Instead now I keep all my water purifiers unlocked with a sign saying ‚Äútake what you need‚Äù with an arrow pointing to them. I keep a public farm/garden too. I put 4 beds and 2 of every crafting station in a welcoming, open porch area. Basically I see no need for a fortress or locks in PVE. It‚Äôd be nice if people would send me some stuff every now and then as a thanks. 
---
Mailing items to players would also be nice, like in ESO and WoW. Mailing to alts and mailing to people who helped you if they didn‚Äôt notice you‚Äôre trade request as well. People could then build a mailbox in their camp. When you have something pending the little red flag would flap up. When empty, it‚Äôs down. This could also help with trading if there is a COD mail option, and the ability to mail to players regardless of online/offline or server you‚Äôre both on. 
---
Speaking of all this, did player vending get pushed back or implemented yet? I haven‚Äôt seen it in-game and I thought it released on April 9th. It isn‚Äôt in the patch notes.l for the 9th either, unless I‚Äôm blind.
---
Now I'm super confused. It's a bit of fun... but having fun makes one a "fuckin' nerd", and the brotherhood is a nerd thing, but raiders are a "bit of fun"... and 100K gamer score? Wut? 
---
I understand your post. 100%. You just want someone to agree with you. You do you, son. You do you.
---
Is it only the Waste Management quest?
---
If featured is added, Im going to have put a toilet in ny camp
---
There's one already in the shop, I already got it. I'm asking where it is in build mode, like the title says...
---
I am so disappointed to hear this. I was looking forward to a challenging, instanced dungeon with some sort of mechanic to complete it. I'm now not as excited to play when I get off work.
---
Is there at least a boss type or legendary creature at the end?
---
yeah, it was the blue one on the end table by the bed in the throne-room. Right? :) It opens up the first door your arrive at, I suspect you were unlucky and someone may have opened it up before you came.
---
Don't reload it again. I found out that after that first spurt, it'll start firing like normal.
---
i did it solo and it was really short and underwhelming, i liked the holotapes but the only room with actual enemies was the last one and even they along with the rewards were really underwhelming considering it‚Äôs meant for a *group* of level 50+ players
---
Well, that is just about how the entire game plays, so... yea.
---
Give them a break, it's the first dungeon. I do agree that dungeons should be instanced and that the enemies within should be leveled to player/team level (with sufficient loot) so that there's a challenge, but at least there's a dungeon now like everyone has been wanting. I've not played it yet, but from what y'all are already saying it's not gonna be worth it.
---
They can take my freedom but they'll never take my ballistic fiber and screws.
---
Honestly the sheepsquatch quests and event weren't all that bad. Just the fact you have to pay so much to do it and 3 hour cooldown is huge bs
---
The burrows was just plain dogshit though :(
---
No need for me to reinvent the wheel when the proper math has already been done and posted by the OP RisingDusk here...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asouq3/psa_anti_armor_is_actually_always_better_than_two/
---
You got legendaries? I didn‚Äôt.
---
Should have put it up for like 2k and have him put it up for 2k. That was entirely your fault. Never swap for free.
---
Took all of 5 minutes. Quest over.
---
All I got from it was the guest reward. No legendaries at all.
---
It‚Äôs on their page someone linked it a few posts down I believe.
---
Up vote, what I came to post.
---
Did they fix the separate mod to item yet?
---
Pathetic is the term. I'm kind of furious/disgusted
---
Kill 50 of 5different type of creatures (50insects, 50scorched,....)
---
I did it solo at level 39 ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Okay let me reword it for you. Sheep was easy for the majority of people over level 100. People under geared and low level should have a hard time! We don't need more content for new players, there's plenty.
---
You should've seen the speech I made to get people hyped
---
Nope, I encountered a legendary ghoul and that was it. No special boss, no special loot (that I could find) or any special mechanics. This isn't a dungeon and to call it that is a insult to all the other ACTUAL dungeons.
---
You don't thank someone for lifting their foot off of yours after they've stepped on it, do you?
---
Ok level 60 not much of a difference unless your nitpicking. Someone 500 levels over you shouldn‚Äôt do the same amount of damage.
---
Lovely story. I get team invites all the time but only accepted them occasionally. Many times when I was sneaking around crowded areas an invite pops up. How do those players even know I was there? Sometimes I paused and looked for them on the map, they were literally half map away. How does this work? I thought when players crouch they won‚Äôt show up on the map? Were they trying to fast travel to the area I was at? I‚Äôm on PS4 as well.
---
No theres a level 46  assaultron  than you can shred like cheddar cheese...
---
North entrance is west of the Harper's Ferry fast travel spawn point, next to the armory. It will look like a Circle with a drop of blood in the center, on your compass. The South entrance is about 100 clicks south of that, towards the SW corner of Harpers Ferry.  Both entrances are manholes on the ground. See you all at 3pm.   o7
---
It takes 10 minutes to beat man.
---
It's honestly an insult. Best part was the atmosphere mostly due to the music.
---
I'm disappointed as I was looking for a lengthy dungeon or something similar to that.
---
The first area with Ghouls was promising with it's maze like design. But the second area was just few rooms with couple of bots. And let's not discuss the super difficult end boss for the quest line.
---
Anyone over level 50 can solo this easily. 
---
I teamed up with another soloist from here in Reddit and we blasted through. It was interesting to see new places, but overall the whole "dungeon" is a big let down.
---
We were both dreading the public dungeon style and unfortunately that was how BGS gave this to us.
---
There is no end boss after the quest (which is doable only once), but yes there are plenty of mobs and they can spawn as legendaries also. Saw multiple there allready.
---
In the end the public dungeon style does not work in this situation. It's going to be a another WS golf club for legendary farming and that means who comes first with biggest stick wins.
---
I would have been happy with single legendary at end. A boss that would give you challenge (not Sheepsquatch style) as the room is perfect for boss fights.
---
Throw couple of Sentry bots (or legendary sentry bot) with dozen Colonel Gutsies and you have a challenge.
---
No I‚Äôm talking OP like clocking over 300 each bullet, which is only the top 5%. I agree that it‚Äôs easy but I also have TSE and grinded armor out the ass.
---
I got a named legendary called The Gutter show up in my inventory?
---
I had one legendary 42lvl ghoul there, when i was leaving.
---
Woah really? I cleaned the place out, but found multiple 3* ghoulies and the end boss. Maybe I just had good RNG? 
---
For me, it seemed worth redoing, but only repetition will tell.
---
only saw 1 legendary, got a 2 star grognak axe, thats it
---
All I got was a one star suppressors combat knife and a whole lot of disappointment
---
This "endgame"? Sad, pathetic... No word.
---
But why? Why would you need any features sitting down?
---
It‚Äôs literally doing nothing.
---
You might as well sleep. That gives an xp bonus at least
---
perhaps they are not "here"
---
Encryptid is anoying too, just different way.
---
15 minutes? you took your sweet time. If anything's left me entirely disillusioned with this game, it's this. A moderately sized underground area that feels barren and empty. A single "poke this" quest with a trash reward.  
---
feels like ALOT of wasted space and barely any input from anyone but the graphical designers. There's no content, no replayability of any sorts because, suprise suprise, there's nothing at all.  
---
What a waste of 5 minutes, what a disgrace we were even excited about it.
---
I was originally thinking it should be outside 76 but Whitespring seems more fitting now that all the faction vendors are there.
---
I‚Äôm not home yet but this sounds disappointing. Maybe it‚Äôs a bug and was intended to have more enemies? Or maybe Bethesda is just super out of touch
---
I don't think there's a correlation. I absolutely believe that the Burrows was everything that they wanted it to be üò•
---
Very disappointing... SO basically it's just a new blip on the map to explore.
---
What happens in the tunnel if we nuke harpers ferry I wonder?
---
Exactly why I said there's no boss, the ghouls were higher than the assaultron. It was an insult.
---
Hey I have an all rise that sits in my stash you can have it, if you want.
---
At least there are some new shrooms in there, tried to cook them but no new recipe appeared on menu and didn't found one in the area either.
---
While we're here, what's a good way to just swap items from one character to my new character? Is the only option to trade with another player, nothing I can do solo in-game?
---
This mix of fallout + mmorpg while lacking major elements from both is... Interesting.
---
Nah dude, they showed ghouls as the enemies in the screenshots... The burrows was going to be easy anyway...
---
Good to know, thank you!
---
Why should we give a company that has been designing dungeons for decades a break? It was crap, plain and simple.
---
Yeah i've ran into more dangerous groups out in the middle of nowhere, let alone quests.
---
My theory : Bethesda have been hitting the jet way too much
---
I mean I‚Äôd expect Encryptid to be the thing that was nerfed if that were the case.
---
Didn‚Äôt see any legendary minions and I got a  1 star chest and the gutter at the end. The gutter doesn‚Äôt seem too horrible though.
---
https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/40o6r9tR5VkoMudGUgl9qg/fb745bd7f94a83991f95c53cf6bb8b8a/Fallout76_RoadMap_1920x1080_WildAppalachia-10-EN.jpg
---
Here is the roadmaps of the update dates
---
You're literally awesome. Adding in five minutes. Finishing new quest.
---
Level 100 is not no life material bud.
---
No life material is 400+, or banned already.
---
Really enjoy the Encryptid event.  Forces people to work together and is sufficiently difficult.  I ran it with a group of players for a few hours last night and had a blast.
---
Yeah.
---
&gt;When the various vendor bots around Appalachia found out we wanted to implement player vending, they weren‚Äôt too thrilled with the idea of new competitors encroaching on their turf. We had intended to bring this feature online with Patch 8, but we will need a little more time to do some. . . convincing. As a result, we‚Äôre moving player vending to Patch 9, which is currently slated for release in May. We‚Äôll keep you updated and share more details about player vending as we get closer to Patch 9.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eQmVlhbjlkX0GzGb7DB3j/inside-the-vault-looking-beyond-patch-8-april-4-2019
---
I keep my garden fenced in myself so I always have grain and such if I need to brew.
---
But yeah, the other day I was gathering snaptail to make sugar (for rum) and some was about to expire. Came across a player camp and used their stove to cook up sugar. They were home at the time so I dropped a bunch of plans I already knew for them (they were like level 19). They used the heart and thumbs up emotes a few times and I was on my way.
---
I don't think it's something you can build, I think you collect all 7 and then you get a decoration.
---
"It just works bro" - Todd (probably)
---
Sitting makes it longer to afk time out. It has features.
---
Like I said in another thread, it sounds like it's basically just another blip on the map to explore.
---
is it a 2\* zealots explosive?  or 3?
---
I don't have a proof for the constant factor in the formula, but the (damage/DR)\^0.365 part is at least roughly correct. If two-shot only added a +25% damage bonus then it would be strictly superior to AA.
---
It seems strange I can open my map in bed or sitting down, but not my arm mounted pip-boy.
---
Yeah, half of my challenge are camera-related and, well, I needs me some Atoms.   
---
Sadface.
---
I M M E R S I O N
---
yeah I'm curious to see what we'll be able to craft with them down the line :) I didn't get anything new to cook yet either, not from the science bench either so that makes me even more curious what will come (Y)
---
Very disappointing. As a high level player I was expecting more of a challenge, yet I ran through solo in less than 10 minutes with a super sledge. Ended up with 1* vampire assaultron blade and a few meds.
---
I think I spent more time finding my way out than I did on the mission itself.
---
It's under statues in floor decor
---
Very underwhelming
---
Are you trying to defend this poor excuse for a dungeon or are you trying to say that because it‚Äôs ‚Äúfree‚Äù it‚Äôs okay for it to be garbage? Either way it‚Äôs fucking garbage
---
So will we be getting extra atom for the dailies and weekly and will will not be able to complete?
---
Also, when in danger please nullify the sit command
---
Gonna keep an eye out for this bastard
---
Ok. I've contacted your local police department and geek squad as you seem to be having some sort of seizure or keyboard malfunction. Don't worry, they will be there soon. Rest now.
---
Yeah, I was expecting a lot more battles and fights! I was hoping for something challenging, because if the BoS tragically died here because a couple bots and ghouls, well you a lot on how well they were equipped...
---
Actually were there any other BoS members inside except for the ones at the start??
---
Glad I'm not up there, then, lol. I don't get attacked much because where I'm at the spawn point for mobs is too far away for them to do much damage.
---
u/valseek
---
BGS needs to cater to the endgame a little more. They hyped the shit out of this and it‚Äôs only full of lvl 68 ghouls. Not even a legendary.  They‚Äôre worse than Jagex in like, every way. Broken crafting, stealth nerfs up the ass, nerfing shit that doesn‚Äôt need nerfing, like taking plans and recipes out of the game and crafting menus. Ffs.
---
yeah.
---
i didnt see any other corpses than a few settlers here and there, i didnt think about that but now that you mentioned it it does stand out
---
The good: 
---
caps from almost every mob
---
New area to explore
---
Quest reward is unique
---
Interesting story
---
The bad: 
---
short quest
---
Slow respawn
---
Didn‚Äôt see any plan spawns
---
No reason to return?
---
Yes I'd say it's like west tek, but even west tek has a chance to spawn three legendary enemies and better xp rewards. This just feels like to the face.  I will say unlike west tek it does appear to respawns when you go back in but I cant tell if it another people coming to test the dungeon out.
---
5 mins of solid FUN. Yeah...
---
- waves and locks the door behind him/her-
---
Also eat and drink while sitting.
---
SO UR FUCKING TELLIN ME, I DONE THAT SHIT AND DIDNT EVEN GET WHAT EVER THE FUCK THE GUTER IS?
---
Courtesy tho
---
*nods*
---
Shhh. Rest now, help is on the way.
---
seeya
---
Do you want them to release something that doesn't work properly?
---
Long as the storage size was relatively small. 100 space maybe, so as to not stress the servers more?
---
Swarm of Suitors and Heart of the Swamp events produce tons of mirelurks.  Canines can be found at the isolated hut near Vault 76.
---
Ah, I haven‚Äôt really looked at the challenges this week
---
I think you're mixing up the words naturally and unnaturally
---
either way thx for the suggestion. Didn't think about that being a prerequisite.
---
yasee
---
Actually im at work so i wouldnt know weather its good or bad. Due to all the crying on here im guessing its bad but theres a whole lot of crying that gets done on reddit. 
---
No im actually speaking from logic... and facts also. Like you said you bought the game because there was going to be more content. Im assuming you bought a game a normal game price correct? What did you pay for the extra content? In dollars exactly. Thats all asked. Not for a hissy fit
---
Joining :D
---
Holy crap! Sounds like RNJesus blessed you. You are the first that I've heard that has had any luck down there.
---
Visually nice, lame overall
---
God tell me about it, I first entered and I felt fear just by the surroundings and its music, but then it all just fell down on itself when there was like nothing. Not even much lore or stuff to read! Not much to listen to!
---
/thumbsup
---
I made a post (which didn't get any traction) recently asking if Bethesda had ever commented on this subject. I'm still under the impression that they never have. I'm a solo player and would love to see some way, any way, for me to be able to transfer items between my account's characters without the need of a third party.
---
Shit.
---
Lol. Sort by "new" and scroll. You'll see what people think.
---
5 minutes is a stretch.
---
Potentially, Though as another commenter pointed out earlier, there would be no benefit other than griefing. And the option to give up while downed could provide a way out, depending on how fast the griefer is with a stimpack. I think a more likely exploit would be reviving someone that was downed by PvE only to kill them immediately after. This would cause a transfer of caps that would not have occured otherwise.
---
you what now? Legendary?! :O
---
.....there‚Äôs literally like 20 posts on this already. And they‚Äôre all upset
---
It's neither balanced for 2 or more 50+ players nor tough to take on alone.  It's less difficult than West Tek.  I was hoping for a multilevel dungeon with separate parts that you enter through doors or sewer grates or some parts only accessible underwater.  The way this was hyped in the Inside the Vaults, please tell us that there is more Burrows content that has yet to be unlocked?
---
What was the end boss because we've done it twice and there is like nothing there a few ghouls and a couple assaultrons?
---
If u rly want to know
---
Its dog shit piss poor boring
---
Ninjaed :)
---
I figured it was just a fluke, thanks for keeping us informed! Keep up the hard work :)
---
I‚Äôd rather the game as a whole be delayed with all the bugs. They just HAD to open that atom shop as quick as possible.
---
Yeah it looks dece but not a ton to do, found a few 3* legendary ghouls tho
---
I stopped playing when I saw that the sheep missions were so stupid, wait 1 week, and I find this
---
How are they gonna open up this joke that is the burrows and then try and sell shit lol. Bad timing guys, if you want to sell stuff don't hype everyone up with these lies then disappoint them.
---
Troll is a troll. You‚Äôve been all over comments today being a negative piece of shit
---
This is just hilariuos. We were promissed HARD dungeon for SEASONED PLAYERS and what we got was a easy 10minutes run for even new players.
---
O think they respawns when you reenter the burrows but I cant tell if its implemented that way or if its other people coming to see the new "content"
---
I wouldn‚Äôt even be dissapointed. Not even like fixer where it‚Äôs good or craftable.
---
 'Dungeon' size: 4/10 The first area was promising maze, but needed about 20 similar areas for to be a dungeon
---
'Dungeon' layout: 5/10 
---
Story: 1/10 What story? Find the missing BoS guy and get the quest? He's next to the ladders when you go down.
---
Difficulty: 1/10 Soloable by anyone over 50, no challenge an no boss fight
---
Reward: 1/10 Normal junk all over
---
Fun: 1/10 Same fun as WS running
---
All you ever do is shitpost and spam when a mediocre update comes out, and complain.
---
Then, you go ü•∫ ‚ÄùI‚Äôm not being shitty‚Äù and act all surprised when people call you out for being a garbage human being.
---
Go away. Don't riddle good people with your filth.
---
Luckily the actually achievable ones are fairly easy
---
I would also like the ability to turn off the option to sit in furniture by accident while looting stuff!
---
This should be the nail in the coffin for Turoks Jack Shack.
---
Yes, the map is available, but not the pip-boy. Not even the secondary view of the pip-boy is available, which I think is pretty weird.
---
Fair enough, it would be good as an option too.
---
I expected a linear underground level filled with mobs, every sector gets harder and harder. 
---
Nope, chaotic underground sewer-village filled with weak ghouls.
---
Quest completed in 10 minutes with my sniper char, searched another 30min for hidden areas etc. Nothing.
---
The door you couldn't get through a a valve down another hallway, turn it then use terminal to unlock door
---
The encryptid event and this dungeon are from the same patch, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve had time to nerf it.
---
You ought to know people are rather passionate about games, especially in this day and age where game companies willingly ignore player feedback. So it falls on deaf ears. Feedback doesn't fall on deaf ears between like-minded people. Your point is arguable about the priority of this mistake/inconvenience, but you lose credibility with the statement "a game "no one is playing"" This is false, and you state it just to reinforce your opinion. Your snide recommendation is irrelevant for the topic. If you do not play this game, nor acknowledge the activity within said game, then you add nothing to the topic at hand. Your participation has concluded. Good day to you.
---
ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
If thinking that makes you feel better, that's fine.
---
It won't change the facts.
---
All of the data for how spawning works is also on the client side. Bethesda does this to try tok minimize the amount of time the game takes to load areas.
---
Can we not use our pip-boys in bed? How many times do we use our phones in bed? 
---
Also, anywhere we can use the map should he a place we can use the pip-boy.
---
Such a disappointment. i was hoping for something hard. Something where my LVL 150 char wuld die repeatedly and I would need 1hour+ to complete, but what I got was like a fight with lvl1 scorched and it took me 10 minutes to complete...
---
That just means you‚Äôre doing more nothing. Just sleep?
---
Was expecting it to be an istance, but it wasn't. It was really easy and i don't even have a meta build. Dunno, i'm... Sad.
---
I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT THE FUCK IT IS
---
I lost a right arm piece I thought I was just going crazy lol
---
Commando builds are fun for like 2 weeks.. everybody will eventually play shotgun or melee build /prophet mode off üòé
---
What are the stats on it?
---
It‚Äôs an instigating fat man
---
Literally LOL'd
---
What
---
When the only thing that's good about a dungeon is it's 'visuals' then there is a BIG issue at hand here. I can safely say you won't waste anytime doing this dungeon as it only took me 15 minutes to do.
---
It's the golden garbage bag. Looks cool, but there's still garbage inside.
---
Do we have any idea when we can expect player vending? I've been holding onto plans, recipes and mods with plans to sell them at a discount, but my stash limit is maxed out with them and idk if maybe I should just drop them in a suitcase somewhere at this point...
---
What kind of low life would scam people in a video game.
---
Missed opportunity to call it a libearal conspiracy.
---
Is there an end to the Dungeon? Because me and my friend are a the Pumping Station.. got a key. But there is nothing in sight? There have been nothing more than a few enemies?
---
Sheepsquatch.
---
OH MY FUCKING GOD I JUST FOUND THE HOLO TAPE TO START THAT SHIT AFTER I COMPLETED IT
---
&gt;I think people want to trade items more so to transfer good items to alts.
---
This is exactly why I want a shared stash of some sort. I'm leveling an alt that's based around pipe weapons and the fact that some of them can benefit from rifle and pistol perks simultaneously. She's almost level 40 and I've yet to find a single legendary pipe weapon, meanwhile, my level 160 something melee main sound a level 30 Instigating Explosive pipe bolt action. I ended up carrying it around for over a week waiting for a friend I trusted to be online and help facilitate the swap.
---
Yeah, I bought the First Excavator Paint that released and was tempted to buy the Raider version and now the Silver one. However it‚Äôs pointless buying more than one otherwise the others go to waste since I only have one set of Excavator Armor. 
---
If they made it so that these paints can be applied to even 1 other set of armor then I‚Äôd buy them.
---
NVM...it's the quest reward. It's a Lvl 45 vampire's assaultron blade. I think 88 dmg.
---
Could just be me, but if your gonna make a "Dungeon" and not have it instanced for you or your team, then I'm having a hard time believing the vault "raids" will be instanced either.
---
I was just starving for lore, history so I went through the damn thing so many times! I did find settler corpses but they just had their normal randomised loot of dogfood, pre war money and packs of cigarettes. And I think i only got like a good 3-4 holotapes and maybe a note out of that. I got a key but don't know if I used it or not
---
IO still cant believe this is for real. Are they really that... i dont know what, or are they making fun of us? This "dungeon" is so lame.
---
Can‚Äôt be a bug as they made us all aware of the projected camera delay. This is a dumb oversight. I love this game, but Jesus Christ, I wish they would try just a little to not make simple mistakes like this
---
Honestly... a lot of people enjoy the game on multiple different levels. If someone pays for more storage for junk and gets a few extra perks that doesn't effect game play why not?   
---
I'm literally making and giving away armor and weapons all the time dropping it to new players and helping them out, space would be nice but I have to say ESO cost is kinda high each month, I won't be extending it after the year is up.
---
It‚Äôs a new free items on the atom shop. If you collect one each day on day 7 you‚Äôll get a special reward.
---
They assume everyone goes around with a sh*t build after this long.
---
There is no challenge for people in this game with bloodied builds running around and one shotting everything.
---
I'm just glad MSG Gutsy doesn't check the Porta-Johns for trash before clearing us off the range.
---
Seems like a good camp item
---
Take the feedback directly to the company then, on their Twitter page, the forums, etc. Reddit is an oddball of a forum.
---
Since you guys are Xbox: Would you like to be absorbed into the reformed Appalachia Brotherhood of Steel (Discord)? Long as your mature/follow orders you'll do fine. My Xbox gamertag: Paladin Bailey. Discord: Paladin Bailey#5712
---
A new one? Not one of the previous 4?
---
I kept telling people not to expect anything great. Nobody listens.
---
Maybe i have missed something but I finished it with my bud in like 30 min just 1 quest, look here, take this, open that and the quest is over
---
Player vending was moved to Patch 9 early next month.
---
From what I've read. The problem is it's just an area the entire server can explore and not really a dungeon?
---
Brotherhood Scribe body as soon as you enter the sewer gives it
---
Is that the breakthrough feature you guys need?
---
Just tried with level 5 makeshift warrior and it didn‚Äôt work
---
Yeah, I feel a bit lost for words at the moment. I hopped on for the 10 mins I had to spare expecting I'd maybe get a taste of the beginning of the dungeon or something. Instead, without paying much attention and using like 2 stimpacks, I finished it!? Very odd, I was hoping for something that would require multiple attempts in a group rather than a solo breeze.
---
The junk is good though... May become my new ammo factory haha.
---
I'm going to save my negativity until I actually try the "dungeon." But from what I'm hearing, it sounds like a disappointment. Even if it is though, I still enjoy the game. I'm not going to just give up on it.
---
insert picard facelpalm here
---
Bring forth the pink eyed 3-star ghoul!!
---
And bethesda makes more disappointing content, shocking
---
Starts with a note downstairs in Ingram
---
It feels like I‚Äôm missing something. Was there a final boss? Is there a second half? I honest to god have no idea what just happened in there. It took maybe three minutes to complete and there was like 8 people and two holotapes. Why was this not instanced? What‚Äôs supposed to be the reward, where‚Äôs the challenge? There wasn‚Äôt a single Legendary in there.
---

That's pretty laughable that you won't give them a chance to even fix their game when about every AAA company goes through this process nowadays. It's just how video games work now.
---
Oooh, excellent! I‚Äôm happy to hear there‚Äôs more to do. Now somebody oughta start checking to see if Sheepsquatch has started appearing..
---
Perfect. Ill keep an eye out for those.
---
It's badüòê
---
100%. I want to sit and check the map, browse my inventory, and read/listen to holotapes.
---
There you go if you quit due to them, they will win. You never let griefers win in any game.
---
how did you activate the quest?
---
I noticed this too, there used to be a legendary bot outside the shop almost all the time, I've been there 20+ times today and found nothing.
---
Huh,  for a one handed weapon the gutter aint too bad
---
It is hoax, you know.
---
I'm curious about the Diver Suit armor they teased too.
---
Ugh, alright thanks for the heads up. Couldn't find it anywhere.
---
More "I don't do it so it's pointless" talk...
---
Why do people RP, run non meta builds, collect costumes, PvP, troll, roll new characters, play games at all...
---
BECAUSE THEY WANT TO DUDE!
---
How is it that hard to grasp? 
---
And why act like someone elses entertainment is less valuable than yours? Why do you care if we want to be able to do things while we sit? What are we taking away from you exactly? Do you really think adding functionality to sitting is going to take away a dungeon or raid away from you?
---
Imagine being able to throw anything.
---
Don't worry, I won't waste my time on Reddit. Bethesda doesn't care about my opinion rather it's good or bad. :Shrugs:
---
No life material is when you just pick on Lower levels because your bad at the Game and can't actually pvp with someone Good. Get outta Here I can guarantee your toxic as well
---
Thet bad. it just have no sense and no point to exist. A couple of not instanced tunnels with casual ghouls and robots with no boss and no reward is not a dungeon at all. Its even not a location. Its... hmmm... honestly i even cant say what is it)
---
You guys are such petulant children. All you guys do on this sub is whine and beg for new content personally tailored to your likings and you start getting it and it‚Äôs ‚Äúthis is crap!‚Äù. 
---
This sub has turned into children whining and begging for free shit. You got your $60 worth in the base game, don‚Äôt expect Bethesda to give you amazing content without a ROI - they‚Äôre not in business to give you free shit so just deal with it and grow up, babies.
---
You can downvote me all you want, but truth hurts, I know.
---
Mods are still broken
---
There is throwing spears!!
---
*everyone else at the birthday party*
---
I just sat down and pulled out my phone, so needless to say, yes I do
---
Yeah the quest was actually really anti climatic for me even the dungeon hoards
---
Yeah.  If I didn't need it for weight reduction, it would conceivably free up Martial Artist for something else since it doesn't really benefit from it.
---
YUP.
---
So it will be a walk in the park, havent done the burrows yet
---
I am si disapointed with this, only 20 minutes and that's it
---
Is that really it - Once the quest chain is complete there is really nothing else?
---
Sweet thanks for the info
---
A breakthrough feature would be you realizing your fallout experience will not change at all if this was implemented.
---
This was fucking terrible.
---
That's awesome! XD
---
I told you. Not even reskinned, just ghouls and an assaultron.
---
I have a pair of lead veins on a cliff that I am going to set up a vertical camp on. Wish I knew this before. Tonight, we dine on lead!
---
Sure Todd. Whatever you say.
---
Inb4 putting all 7 eggs in a circle summons a Level 99 Deathclaw
---
If you drink out of it, and then spam collect while the drinking animation okays, you can get about 15 at a time (plus bonus dysentery)
---
I went in, almost everything was dead already, a few ghouls occasionally spawned and then finished the quest in 2 hits. Nothing about it is a 'dungeon' like other games, its just another little area.
---
No prep needed, you just run, kill some trash, read a note, get a key, open a door, turn some valves, go to the main room kill some robots, get a named junk weapon, some legendarys that you will probably vendor. All done in less than 10 minutes.
---
Think Bethesda is balancing pve with casual players on mind. Hardcore players with all those duped gears and min-maxed builds? Yeah have fun 1 shotting everything
---
How do you get into it?
---
Screw the examples, Bethesda has a decade of experience DESIGNING dungeons. They fully deserve all the hate they get for the burrows when Oblivion has more challenging dungeons.
---
Bethesda should make repairing an item a daily challenge for Atoms until they fix it, because it is a challenge daily! ;) 
---
I agree, this needs to be hot fixed.
---
What‚Äôs your psn my guy
---
I agree with you and don't. You're absolutely right that it's a dick move to turn on the people you've been working with to complete an event immediately after it's over. But that doesn't mean it shouldn't be allowed. There are plenty of movies and games involving one character turning on another as soon as the goal is reached. Sometimes you see it coming, sometimes you don't. One location in FO4 that stands out in my memory is the harware store. The raider outside pretends to be a settler (hell, the game even identifies her as a settler) who begs you to come help her friend. If you follow close behind her, you can easily run into the room after her to find yourself surrounded by raiders. It was a trap. They aren't supermutants, who's fake offers of aid are easily transparent. They are people, easily capable of subterfuge.
---
Same thing with the stash box. Dick move. Perfectly allowable. I find I'm less frustrated with the player who killed me in those situations than I am with the amount of time it takes for me to react.
---
Good look üôèüèæ
---
Anyone who can clear whitesprings golf club house (non-nuked) can solo Burrows in 5-10mins.
---
I had 2x 3* lvl 62 ghouls spawn in my solo (only) run
---
That‚Äôd be cool if it was a pet deathclaw!
---
"It's just how games work now." Is the exact mentality which is destroying AAA games nowadays. It's been 5 months and there has been no improvement on this game. I wanted this game to be good, but there comes a time where you need to accept the reality of what's going on here.
---
See I seem to remember in FO4 that it would go slow for like the first 100 then go like 10 at a time after that. I also might be thinking of a different game.
---
It's not that people are made it isn't great, it's just the fact that it was one quest and a new location that takes five minutes to run through. This isn't a dungeon, like I'm still running around trying to find something else because they could not have spent all this time working on just this
---
Did you play this quest?
---
Weird. I‚Äôm not a bloody build and I still find that there needs to be more challenges.
---
As a level 60ish player with no friends, I'm kinda relieved to hear this.
---
You can watch videos of the vaults already on youtube xD If Burrows is like this the vaults are going to be like this too.
---
yeah, im realizing that due to cool and nice people here, thank you
---
i was very upset when it happened, im cooling off now...
---
follow a drop icon on compass in harpers ferry
---
Is this a late April Fools joke?
---
never mind, found it! there are two quests  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bdwn6f/two\_new\_quests\_with\_the\_burrows\_update\_mounted/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bdwn6f/two_new_quests_with_the_burrows_update_mounted/)
---
Really? I've been in here a few times with my friend - in awe thinking there is more. Just to come here and see that there isn't.. didn't see any Legendaries. Guh.
---
I honestly can't even put into words how disappointed I am
---
It's not instanced, went and the entire place was DEAD and already had 5+ players running through it
---
I REALLY hope vaults aren't like this...
---
No, my phone fits in my pocket.
---
Careful when you go in. You can get the quest and someone ahead can complete it immediately.
---
6 min to drop
---
Todd, there's not much difference between a level 50 character and a level 100 character  because by the time you reach level 50 you have unlocked all the perks.
---
There‚Äôs suppose to be a new game mode in nuclear winter called (believe it or not /s) ‚Äúnuclear winter‚Äù. So fingers crossed it‚Äôs to make the game hard at later levels?
---
That counterpoint is so terrible it essentially agrees with me that it‚Äôs a waste of resources.
---
I paid 60$ plus tax for the extra content personally. Not sure what is so confusing about that. Content being added after the games release was explicitly stated from the Bethesda so it is part of the purchase price. They didn't say they would think about adding content down the road or some certain condition had to be met, it was a given. I 100% would not have bought the game if there wasn't going to be additional content and I'm sure most people feel the same way.
---
Agreed! Where them dataminers at, somebody find out
---
What facts? That you don‚Äôt play the game and come here to troll? Or the opinion that your disappointed. Please tell me which is a fact
---
I got a named assaultron blade with legendary effects as a quest reward.
---
Yep I've just done it! Was more interesting than the burrows, and apparently there's another one down by Southern belle motel!
---
Ran through the burrows one shotting everything with a level-action rifle, no bloody build. If you put any thought into your build, everyone should be doing the same by level 50. There's no challenge in this game at all.
---
I enjoyed it took me 25 min but it had lots of enemies and steel! Lead! Plastic! Is the mission repeatable?
---
üßÇ
---
I was asked about it so I answered them and linked to [SaukPuhpet](https://www.reddit.com/user/SaukPuhpet)'s tutorial. I also said "(most people don't wait that long and use online encrypters though)." 
---
I just want people to have fun with nukes in game. I'm sorry for the misunderstandings and once again I'm very grateful that sites like nukacrypt ect exist for everyone to use. I have not and do not have any intentions of trying to claim credit for someone else's hard work.
---
That's not good.
---
I was able to solo it it the moment it went live.  I'll just say this.
---
That first experience you had of just walking through with little to no challenge?  Even if the mobs weren't dead there wouldn't be any difference.
---
Lucky
---
Just did.  Was pretty small. Took 20 minutes. Difficulty was ok. Some legendary mobs at the end. Seems good for legendary farming after first time but not much else. For a unique melee weapon for doing quest.
---
Correction: Toxic Larry's is northwest*
---
Especially on toilets. Can we sit on toilets in the game? I've never tried. Should be in next patch.
---
Haven't done it yet, but if it's another place to farm some ghouls I'll be happy with it. Whitesprings is always clusterfucked, so hopefully it'll spread things out a bit more. Curious to see if nuking it does anything interesting.
---
SPOILERY RANT
---
The only thing remotely interesting was the lore. Aside from that nothing. Ultra short, no "missing brotherhood of steel members" gruesomely killed by a mysterious menace (nor "mysterious menace" for that case) as I was expecting because of the information BGS dropped earlier, only 1 legendary I found (wasn't even the boss). Sad.
---
too bad it sucks
---
I‚Äôm not clocking 300 or close.
---
Hard pass on this line of thought, the burrows was so pathetically easy I was genuinely confused when it was over
---
Its one word ... Nightkin
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Nightkin
---
Definitely, and it would be an easy fix too. The quantity of enemies was alright, it's just that ghouls (outside of nuke zones) are dead easy to kill. Replacing them with super mutants would have made it much more challenging. If they had made it instanced (sad that it's not), they could have made it so the enemy type and level scales with your own.
---
It's a relief tbh, thought my actual mod was bugged
---
Isn‚Äôt it technically instanced? As it‚Äôs off the world server? Just not instanced the way we thought or wanted (party only)?  I‚Äôm not defending Big Bs design but I don‚Äôt think they have the ability to turn this single player game engine  to multiplayer then again turn it into divider multiplayer style. I‚Äôd like them too, but I feel that‚Äôs just wishful thinking on my part and might be over stretching their capabilities
---
Some may perish. The server may (will) crash. But you'll all be remembered.
---
Maybe they meant that The Burrows is balanced to be a challenge *specifically for 2 level 50 players*. Like, if you're higher than that, it's not balanced for you and will be too easy. Could that have been their intent????
---
yep, and i'm too. just threw it away immediately seen its stats. Dont get me wrong - formally its a reward, but it have no value for any player who just completed 50lvl quests like "Mayor for a day" etc. 
---
All this situation with burrows looks like joke from Bethesda. Sadly - 1st of April has passed
---
I like this idea. I think the first would be the better idea. And to keep in the spirit of the money hungry government, (and to keep it reasonable) charge a fee. 5 caps=10 pounds. Add a higher coast to higher levels (as we will have more caps later, then we won't care) just to encourage people to transfer what's important, not frivolous items.
---
Yes, if you just want to be able to eat while killing. It depends on what you want to cannibalize. If you want to eat players then you need more points. And there are other enemies that are not in the first level.
---
Sell em to the purveyor
---
I blame unscrupulous people for making unscrupulous choices when other choices are available to them.
---
Heh yeah, thats one good thing about it I guess XD
---
Yeah it does that. I really wish you could just enter manually on the number though. Scrolling makes me feel like a peasant.
---
you havent even played it...? and you are here defending it? you sir, are blocked, i will not be subjected to your fuckery
---
Interested in your level and loadout... min/maxed or "average"
---
I was disappointed too. It was a pretty cool area design, but it wasn't really any more interesting than any other interior cell area, it felt like it should have been a random dungeon in the base game, not hyped up brand new content. I'll wait until it becomes less popular to see how populated with enemies it actually is supposed to be, but yeah, I hope this isn't any indication as to how the vaults are going to be when they're released.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of dickheads out there. RuneScape used to have a *huge* scam problem with people ripping each other off in trades. No idea what it‚Äôs like now but this isn‚Äôt surprising
---
E. Mwkwkw
---
This is really along the lines of what I was expecting. An actual MMORPG style dungeon.
---
Is the burrows live now? I kept checking all morning but no update was printed
---
now bro, its been up for like 30 mim
---
So they pushed back cameras, and yet we have dailies for cameras? What and why.
---
Exactly my experience - spent the last 20 minutes running around convinced i must have missed something - but no - that's really it!
---
Haven't looked at notes and terminal honestly it feels like it should've been a hub area instead the place looks nice lots of benches to work on.  It's just... mediocre enemies... I didn't expect new enemies but I thought there would at least like some kind of over the top deathclaw or mirelurk queen... but no it was just a lvl 46 assaultron tha yt yo can easily kill the moment its born...
---
wont take you more than 5 minutes, good luck
---
This dungeon wasn't in the roadmap, so I look at it as an easy mode test of what comes next.
---
Shame it's not instanced tho.
---
Agree
---
Btw they didn‚Äôt even fixed problem with mod attached
---
I was afraid of this.  :(  I might stay away from it for a week or so until I see no one in the area, then go so the experience isn't ruined by 35 people already being in there and everything dead or dead as soon as I arrive.
---
So it's like the Whitespring golf club where you pay 30 caps to travel there and the place is empty?
---
For fucks sake Bethesda please shit can this multiplayer bullshit and give us Fallout 5.
---
It‚Äôs like a public dungeon in eso
---
Oh, my bad üòÑ
---
I noticed. Really bums me out
---
Dropping it now!!
---
Yeah - it didn't need an update. It was baked into the content update last patch.
---
There are no plans for x01 armor? I'm not sure you understand.
---
It was pushed back to a latter patch.
---
Is there another part besides the after pump room-what you refer to as the old burrows?
---
Not the same dungeon. 
---
Those are images of Arktos Pharma
---
idk how instanced is it, but i've met another player in this "instanced" dungeon. and yes, i'm playing without team.
---
I think the camera was delayed. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong though. Maybe they forgot to delay the challenges too?
---
That‚Äôs fine but who ever said it was gonna be a hour long thing? People got themselves overhyped and are now mad cause of it
---
Because Bethesda, such a question.
---
I had the same experience on xbox with a guy named A Ghrizzly with a explosive combat shotgun pre nerf.
---
Well shoot, I waited all morning and could have been playing, so it‚Äôs not good?
---
It's more of a question of *when.*
---
Grafton highschool gym is a prime location for farming rubber. 2 bins full of basketballs and kickballs.
---
My assumption here is that by dungeon they meant what *they* refer to as a dungeon, ie; caves and mines, not in the WoW sense of it being an instanced location with harder difficulties and rare loot, which I again assume is going to be their raids.  
---
Which is disappointing considering it's supposed to be a challenge, but I guess it's no more difficult than a solo run through Lucky Hole cave from the way people make it sound.
---
FUCKING THIS BETHESDA.
---
I don‚Äôt think the mission is but you can respawn the enemies but leaving and coming back I believe
---
There is a key I do not think that is the real dungeon the key is called burrows old tunnel key me and my friends are trying to find what it goes to
---
Actually my initial post was to tell everyone to shut up and stop ruining it for others. Clearly reading isnt a course in your fuckery.
---
Pics?
---
Correct you could meet all 24 people in there. I think big B sold it too us as instanced in that it‚Äôs removed from the world map.  It‚Äôs not instanced as only you or your party can be there.
---
That cave is next to a fissure site.y
---
I always inspect my gear. I may have passed one up in the early days I never picked up armor. But I would love the rush of finally getting one
---
I actually followed their advice and went there with a team mate.   We breezed through it pathetically easily. in  minutes. I wish I had done it solo.. Maybe then at least it would have been something resembling a challenge.
---
u/ladydevann
---
I would bet one kidney that we don't get any compensation.
---
I do want more challenging content but people who expected they‚Äôre perfect build that takes 70 percent less damage to die are being ridiculous
---
Yup, and Morgantown and watoga high schools are great for plastic
---
I've already got 5,000 lbs of crappy 3* legendaries to sell to him. I don't have room to store the 1* stuff.... LOL
---
Like the responder vendor bot?
---
Yeah? Well, my point is mute now. Still I expected so much more. Thanks for the info
---
The thing is the dungeon looks pretty nice, but how they advertised it 
---
"2 level 50+ recommended"
---
" If you manage to emerge victorious, you‚Äôll receive plenty of loot and experience for your troubles."
---
Then the level is set to a random house in whitespring, completed in 5 minutes. They could have made it somewhat of a challenge by just changing the enemies that spawn or giving a boss. It was a total mistake on their part and i hope they'll tune it to be rewarding like they said, even if they dont make it super challenging.
---
I was in Toxic last night with a low level alt and stumbled on a Level 45 mirelurk Queen bathing in one of the lakes. Now \*that\* makes your blood rush.
---
That‚Äôs understandable from a story perspective but in terms of gameplay they both seem fine
---
We encountered 4-5 2-3* legendaries
---
Ahh... Well that's a bummer. Thanks for the info.
---
Was the Burrows mean to be completed in 5 minutes or are we all missing something?
---
I stopped reading at "must of."
---
Wouldn't worry about it - also a solo player - got through it in 15 minutes. There are also other people in there so just tag along with some if you are worried about the difficulty.  Its really not that great - you will fly through it and have nothing to show for your effort at the end :)
---
I wouldn't go that far. Lazy ass, yet still provides constant content.
---
Nice! Did you get the wall mount?
---
Yes? I didn‚Äôt expect to plan my whole day around this quest now I can farm the area as I please. What should I be upset about
---
It's literally less than 5 minutes. 
---
You get the quest in the tunnel (you're not prompted by the game the location exists - it's near Harpers Ferry). You literally walk through 2 things - and complete it in a total of 5 minutes or less. 
---
Then you get a 1* Vampire's Assaultron Blade that is named "The Gutter" that is worthless.
---
You may have just missed one, but there was like nothing of lore in there sadly...
---
When I ended it I keep myself like... What the hell did I just do with my time?
---
So now I don't play the game because an Internet stranger says so. Okay, that's fine, keep living in your delusion. *shrug*
---
Check the sub for a while, I'm sure that even someone with your IQ will understand what's going on.
---
Pfft it's more like finding a radroach and stepping on it at lvl 4.  Itll keep writhing around when its head is off but only for a few minutes with little to no effort
---
The theme of Fallout 76, completely embodied by your title!
---
Its an online game dumbass lol! What online game doesnt have additional content? I remember my first online game
---
Shhhhh!
---
I pictured the speech from Independence Day lol.
---
I only found one terminal and that assualtron but nothing worth doing all that, the sheepsquatch event is better and more rewarding this was just a waste of time :/ what happened to that massive cave system they showed in the trailer for the burrows a couple weeks ago with massive green glowing plants on the ceiling and walls with high level enemies, I'm very disappointed in Bethesda's attempt at "end game" content
---
Don't cut yourself on that edge there, champ
---
Gotten plenty of decent explosive guns.  But never  a level 50 one. Even got a aa explosive lever action from uranium fever
---
Yup. I mean, the story it's kinda... Nice? I'm hoping that the last holotape is a "preview" of later things. (I'm tryng to don't do any spoiler). But yeah, it's... Dunno. Sad.
---
Def wanted to spend more time than I spent prepping I‚Äôll tell you that.
---
"The Burrows is balanced to be a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault Dwellers, but truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone." - Inside the vault burrows and camera preview. This is the primary reason people are so dissapointed, it genuinely takes more effort to clear the whitespring than it did to clear this dungeon
---
From what the quest objectives imply, that key is supposed to be used to open up the jail cell door before the part where you turn the valve and open a door via the terminal. It wasn't actually locked for me, but the objective said to find the "old tunnel key" to "unlock it"
---
No no no, see, they meant it to be a challenge for 2 specific level 50 players, namely JimBob and xXx_nupSlayzor420_xXx. They find it challenging.
---
The rest of us just faceroll through.
---
The problem is this shouldn't be a system where it's randomized. 
---
A dungeon is catered content.. this is just another location in the game with a quest.
---
Wait til they nerf it.... the witch costume now requires rubber, and is worth half as much.
---
Def wanted to spend more time questing than I did prepping.
---
Yeah I agree. Terrible quest. Yikes.
---
That's good, but not long, and not instanced, as said in the post.    
---
I had a good time in, but I enventually found 2 other players, and it became very easy.
---
I'd be fully with you on that if it didn't seem like the place was as easy as it is. I'll play through it before work and see for myself. I'm not super OP. I die all the time farming Whitespring and West Tek. Could be a challenge for me, but not someone who had enough time or caps to get a TSE shottie and spend the entire dungeon jumping.
---
Balanced for 2 fresh level 50 characters with no legendary items and half their armor broken.
---
Mhm! I went for the lore and not loot (Okay maybe the diver suit) but all I walked out with was a a unique weapon which isn't very special, "The Gutter", and a random legendary drop from a ghoul that spawned legendary. I'm just disappointed at this...
---
I am confused too, we didn't get the actual Sheepsquatch and several quests from the Shear Terror expansion. And i also suppose that underground locations from trailer are 3 different dungeons, one of which is Burrows, other is Vault 51 and there's probably will be one more, or maybe both of then were Vault 51.
---
Sorry im not a vessel to explain how to use context clues.
---
Well that‚Äôs disappointing, the dungeon was the thing I was looking forward to most for the first season of dlc, other than player vending
---
I also wonder if, this being Bugthesda, something isn't working right. I came in solo and it wasn't instanced, kept finding dropped paper bags and very few enemies. Only time I had an issue was the one time that there were mobs in volume, almost got mauled by a bunch of ghouls.
---
I didn't even get a reward for completing the mission
---
We had a bunch of issues with that last night. But when we server hopped it fixed them
---
I was hoping they made it a party instanced dungeon requiring a cap sink style item to repeat it.  Assuring good loot inside.  Would force caps off the server and make it so repeating it costs 500 caps. Win win! But I guess it‚Äôs just another Wes Tek. Either way free content!
---
I gobble em and they make me stronger.
---
More mediocrity from bethesda.
---
They need to stop using this old ass engine to make games. The game feels as if it was made in 2005. 
---
They deserve the criticism honestly. They keep releasing crap and there are still a TON of bugs in the game.
---
It is that quest, but, no, I would not say it contains the truth about Sheepsquatch. Just another side quest in the same vein as the ones we got last week with the Unsolved ones.
---
So no Leeroy Jenkins homage ‚òπÔ∏è
---
I imagine player vending is mostly going to be useful for consumables and ammo. I have some gear I wouldn‚Äôt sell for 25k
---
They were implemented at the same time.  One wasn't a reaction to the other.
---
I wonder if this will cause a build to be pushed. They've already gotten the metrics on embedded content on a timer/ on a switch     (the Burrows turned on at 10 am EDT?), so they can implement that or make changes to the process in the future as needed.
---
Amazing. Apparently feral ghouls have more human decency than certain individuals.
---
Not just raids dungeons have this too. Both eso and WoW that got little mini bosses in between before you gave the actual boss.
---
Why wouldn't it still retain that feature?
---
Only if there is a BethesdaCare plan in case I drops da PipBoy it into da poop..
---
I used to keep my doors open but as I was out one day, someone came and wrote a bunch of inappropriate saying on the walls and the crafting equipment. So now I lock up, which is to bad for every one else as I had a lead and junk pile in my camp and a tinker table for ammo and bulk crafting right there. Like they say, one reject ruins it all.
---
Anyone who can clear non-nuked Whitesprings Golf Club can solo it in 5-10mins
---
Also THIS WAS suppose to be end game content
---
Civil war dress uses gold now....
---
Like they want this whole game to penetrate us without lube, kisses or even spitting on it...
---
I ran it in about 5 minutes on a support char with no really combat abilities. It's no harder than going to Whitespring golf club.
---
Who hasn't don't this ü§£
---
Well actually *I* told *you* they wouldn't be reskinned
---
I mean I'm in the same train as you. I wasn't really expecting anything great or good from this, but I wasn't expecting nearly nothing at all. That's why I think there's gotta be more
---
Except you could still be scammed that way. He could have you pay 2k for the weapon he's trading and then not buy the weapon you are offering. It's a lot less likely and more convoluted to pull off for just caps, but it's still a possibility.
---
No, it does not lessen replayability.
---
The reason MMOs exist (even if this isn't an MMO) today is mostly due to that sort of content loop. Dungeon variety, replayability. You don't need the Dungeon boss to drop guaranteed loot. But it may have a specified loot pool.
---
That's also why Raids in MMOs generally have timers too. 
---
If they crafted the Dungeon to be catered - as ALL DUNGEONS are in games that refer to their content as DUNGEONS.. then it is a global community expectation that it has some sort of catered content loop.
---
How they design or limit it beyond that - is on them.
---
Call it what you will.. Dungeon, Strike - whatever. The point is that it's an area designed with mechanics, and strategy involved in order to complete it.
---
At this time, it's easier than West Tek. It's not better than West Tek. It can't even be called a Dungeon either. 
---
The Sheepsquatch has mechanics people were hoping would be on BOSSES in the Dungeon. But there aren't any. 
---
All I'm saying is if they're going to compare something to a widely known system in the industry.. they need to even come close to it.
---
What is this nonsense? If something is OP you balance it by nerfing it. Yes: balancing and nerfing are not mutually exclusive things.
---
Bethesda is notorious for this though.  An example is them announcing several upcoming fixes before releasing a patch, but then you later find out that some of the fixes are in the new patch and some are coming at a later date. 
---
It causes a lot of confusion.
---
It was said tha the burrows were going to be instanced but I mean they can‚Äôt even get a camera to work instanced dungeons are waaaaaay over their heads.
---
Agree that difficulty is so so. Legendaries were at the end. There were two 3 star. Time difference is probably finding the key.
---
I killed the Boss and I was like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs it?‚Äù
---
Ha! Thanks for the update! 
---
I'm buying that plushy, and I'm going to hold it, and squeeze it, and name it George!
---
I may be a frumpy middle aged guy, but a plushy is just what the doctor ordered.
---
Btw, how many stars does it have and is one of the Sentinel?
---
The Toxic Larry quest isn't coming up for me. Is it supposed to show up when you enter the area?
---
Bro you‚Äôre way too emotionally invested into a stranger on the internet. It‚Äôs okay to disagree but it‚Äôs not okay to spaz out.
---
Absolutely this. If I didn‚Äôt have uny/cav and my OP weapons it‚Äôd be hard to solo
---
Exact same question here - i was so excited to have a dungeon to farm - but this is easier than a lot of other content in the game - its not worth even going as the rewards are worthless.
---
Lol +1
---
They update the FO76 roadmap as they make changes.
---
Same. I'm still sporting Level 20 armor at level 45.
---
unfortunatelly - its not bug, its a proper questline ending. after you read terminal in the pylon ambush site the quest is disappearing and all you can do - activate encryptid event and defeat an imposter.
---
Nice work!
---
They treat anyone level 50 or higher as identical. A 50 is the same as a 500, in their book. Theoretically they are right, but in application they are completely wrong.
---
Agreed. Maybe instead just classify it as a new location
---
Once you complete the quest itself - given to you from the Brotherhood Scribe body at the north entrance - you get the Sword.
---
I listened to the holotapes and read the terminals - but besides that, the entire quest itself took less than 5 minutes. Even with my VATS Crit stealth build, unfortunately.
---
Yeah, that's it. Did you enjoy it?
---
MODUS Caused all this lol. The enclave in this game is run by a psychoticly damaged AI. They killed off the original enclave because they refused to use the Scorched plague to raise the DEFCON level high enough to drop nukes. The real enemy is MODUS. I would bet money it is also the central sentient intelligence for the scorched hive mind.
---
how did you start this quest?
---
destruction 100
---
It all depends on how you have it modded.  Single shot then rifleman, automatic then commando and shotgun shot then shotgunner.
---
Go there on the second floor for a holo
---
Samee need help
---
Semen?
---
Comment like that in general...
---
It sucks and you know it is going to happen everytime. So why come here in patch / new content days and read them?
---
Wait until you find out the burrows is a 15 minute non instanced dungeon that can cleared naked using a sledgehammer.
---
I'd like to have the choice to play in a hardmode universe where everything is 50++.
---
Sounds like you are landing on servers that are in the event cooldown. Try a couple more hops and see if that fixes it. I had a similar situation with the part where you locate the patrol car and it took a couple hops to come back. Same situation though, no marker and the quest wasn‚Äôt there, but it did come back.
---
Explored the whole thing, nothing interesting except bits and pieces of lore scattered around.
---
The only bright side I can take away from this is that when i get home from work, I'll probably be able to remain solo while completing the related quest and not have 23 other players mobbed in the same spot causing server crashes and respawning all the mobs while I'm reading some terminal entry in the middle of a room.
---
Maybe the best part is not having DannyDaGreat420 "clearing" the place for the rest of us with no regard to the rest of the server wanting a piece of that three star enemy.
---
instances would be great, however the only thing 
---
im against is lockouts, we have enough "endgame" timegates already, and i have a gut feeling the vaults will be timegated as well when they drop. all the timegates do is make me afk for 3 hours or server hop until i find a non locked out silo or a not on cooldown sheep
---
Mods aren't fixed?
---
This. Maybe avoid Reddit until you have a chance the play?
---
I guess I'm hearing the same gunfire like sound sometimes. It almost sounds like weird mix between a drum and gun.
---
They should've paid me to play it.
---
having gunsmith on is almost useless if you dont use guns, only put it on when modding and you‚Äôll save a few points. serendipity is really good for low health builds but not sure about high health builds. life giver wont really be necessary and to me it seems like a waste of points if you‚Äôre gonna avoid damage anyway
---
Yes... I was hopping for a quest as challenging as the nuclear silo (and as long). The worst part is that the location looks great.    
---
Thanks for the weapon.
---
The barbed mod is the trident, so barbed flaming is a flaming trident.
---
Go so Southern belle hotel, on one of the tables near god ol' broken Boomer there's a note, it should activate upon reading it.
---
I'm not sure, honestly. I think I broke the quest chain for that last week but was only able to complete it today. Please try reading the note you can find on the first floor of Ingram Mansion, and letting me know if that sets the quest off you.
---
[Ma] [ri] [11][17]
---
Like I said, self centered.
---
You aren't effecting my mood at all in the way you think you are, lol.
---
Looks like we're in the same boat buddy XD
---
Except both Ultracite and X01 PA make T60 PA obsolete. There's no reason to have T60 armor aside from novelty.
---
thanks!
---
Nice!
---
Ah the good ol' days of Fallout spamming you with loads of enemies at the same time ! let me share my story as well. Was heading towards the fissure site next to the pumpkin patch in the savage divide north east of the Vault 76.  Headed out there to get my commendations to become an Enclave General (hell yeah ! time for some nukin). Myself and my friend were busy doing our business when it all began !  some lvl 50+ scorched, followed by this Legendary Assaultron out of nowhere, After we dealt with her then the real shit hit the fan, ScorchedBeast lvl 60 + in the air and a diseased grafton monster on the ground to Kill. And of course we had a our share Mutant Warlords and Overlords. The whole saga ended, with myself and my overencumbered arse even while in Excavator PA Melee build using my Grognaks Axe for ground folks and a Gailtling Laser for the scorchedbeast. Caught all of the above in 2 mins clips on XB1.
---
Mod boxes are broken.  Crafted mods aren't. 
---
Multiple posts about this topic in the last week.
---
I don‚Äôt know what was wrong.  But none of the bots even attacked me.. it‚Äôs just another scrap lootable location. It‚Äôs big though and an interesting place.
---
looks awesome might need to print it out as a vinyl sticker for my sketchpad
---
I've been watching streamers run this and there are usually multiple legendary enemies.
---
THANKS
---
You cannot fast travel into a different game mode. If you are over encumbered (or the game thinks you are) it will only let you spawn at vault 76. No other icons show up.
---
Ad Victoriam
---
Well, to be fair, if you got lucky and got the plans, and invested in the Hard Bargain perk, you could farm all 1400 caps on the serious cheap. @ 43 caps for 2 plastic 5 cloth, you'd need like 32 costumes and change. You can get two days worth of plastic for that hobby from a single run through MHS.
---
Ran it with a friend, didn't need a friend to do it. Was very short and not very challenging. I appreciate the new content but I feel as if Bethesda seriously underestimated the skills of their player base. Will add it to my daily run for a bit but its a little weak for what i was hoping.
---
Post this on the trading community‚Äôs on ps4
---
People need some damn perspective. Yeah, they overhyped how hard it was gonna be. But this is still a solid dungeon on par with West-Tek or the Golf Club for farming XP/legendaries. It's one of the better dungeons in the game - people just let their expectations run wild.
---
K
---
ive been there for months in the same location, all i get are level 1 chinese robots and low level scorched, and my 2 2nd level heavy machine gun turrets have always taken care of any enemies...
---
but last night my ENTIRE place was leveled, nothing left....
---
Oh yeah - it was more just a suggestion, or more a comparison to current ways to mitigate people from farming something. We know they love to prevent people from having fun.. so something like that is ideally a fair trade for both parties.
---
But yeah - timegates generally work better in games where content is thriving at least.
---
The Sheepsquatch was fine, just stupid that you couldn't actually get a good server at first to do the thing.  
---
Burrows? This was bullcrap. I've been defending Bethesda since day 1, but they really pooped the bed on this one. Me and my friend went in wearing full power armor, and ended up taking it off to conserve fusion cores because we didn't need it. The only part that was remotely difficult was the last fight against the Mr Gutsys, which was still so easy that we did it without PA. Then it ended, and we got some meds and a mediocre sword. No legendary enemies at all.   
---
The problem is that this was supposed to be a dungeon. Harder than the nuke silos, easier than the full blown SBQ raid. The Mistress of Mysteries quest line was harder. And the map is pathetically small for what was promised. They hyped it up as being a dungeon, and it's no more difficult than clearing blackwater mine.  
---
So no, in terms of gameplay, this was an astronomical let down.
---
But you sure bothered to click into the post anyways, waste your precious time coming up with..whatever that was.  One person can‚Äôt type properly and the other is an idiot.
---
You have to wear your Excavator Power Armor and do ore runs. You can easily pull 400(ish) iron ore and 100(ish) lead ore down by Hornwright. Lucky Hole Mine nets you 400(ish) lead ore. You can also run through the inside/outside of WestTek and kill all the super mutants and pick up everything they drop. Scrapping guns with the Scrapper perk nets a ton of plastic and steel. The only real hitch is all the acid you need to smelt. My CAMP is on an acid node and I regularly take over one or all of the acid Workshops on the map.
---
One other tidbit... a crappy unyielding set of "crafting" armor will net you a lot more super dupers. I have a 1\* set that includes a bunch of wood that I put on just to craft. Just get irradiated and away you go.
---
YOU ARE A LIFE SAVER SIR!!
---
I honestly went in expecting to be disappointed.
---
Really? Then why show it in the trailer for the burrows and brewing stations, this new roadmap was the only reason I started playing again, without decent end game content the games just too boring for my liking, I agree it better be of decent length or this nuclear winter we're getting with the 2 vaults better be worth it or I'm going to be more annoyed then I already am
---
Ok so the people of this particular area are all dead because of the scorch beasts. There are tons of other people alive in the world but thid area has scortch beasts.
---
not today, as id hoped
---
Thanks. My problem is when I‚Äôm in the thick of a ghoul storm in WS, or some swarm of super mutants somewhere, as soon as they get a few swipes at me it can be ugly. So i try to avoid damage but sometimes it doesn‚Äôt work. :)
---
I was thinkin saint crispin's day
---
It seems like they really wanted to make it truly a challenge but decided to dumb it down to not cut out returning/new low level players trying to play the new dlcs
---
I agree with everything you just said. Im actually not complaining. Hard to show the tone of our comments. Im happy the way it is for the most part, i dont feel that ive been ‚Äúgrieved or exploited‚Äù against too often in survival. Most have been relatively fair fights. And a lot of the time im laughing when i get killed. 
---
Thats what it is right? In adventure we all try and help eachother, but in survival....we survive. Sometimes you have to shoot first and ask questions later.
---
It can't possibly be any more unnecessarily difficult than the damned sheepsquatch was. Hopefully it atleast gives better rewards.
---
Honestly, no. Not much to the lore of the place and I felt like they completely forgot the entire BoS segment. Had more fun falling into a Fissure pit
---
one can hope...
---
Serendipity is really good to have so is adamantium skeleton if you want a PvP build. If you are looking for a more PvP build you should also get fire proof in endurance so you take less explosive damage.
---
lvl 183...... all i can say is ....um........am i missing something?
---
(please mark your post with SPOILERS)
---
Hahaha no
---
OH THE WEARING OF WRINKLE-FREE DRESS SHIRTS!
---
East of Morgantown. 
---
There's a crazy cat lady house that has 20+ cat food bowls.
---
I would like to sit in a rocking chair and just snipe option.
---
yes!! this. i was expecting a proper raid level experience. instead i got another gutless mission
---
Attention all Responders, the food processing machines at *Mama Dolce's* have finally cooled down enough for them to work again. I've set them up to make cans of stew using ingredients spread around the factory. Mm, the machines make a hell of a racket so ^you'll ^probably ^get ^some ^unwanted ^guests
---
As soon as I heard it wasn't instanced I knew this was going to be the experience. This happens in every mmo that has non instanced dungeons
---
Move your camp to a lead deposit, never forget in cans. Not just cans a lot of the stuff on shelves can contain lead, even toys. The hanging cans are not the only ones. Bring packrat 3 for a bunker run, gym at the start is nice. Also keep swapping it up with the types of ammo you use. Also yeah super duper etc for crafting. You don't always need 5.56 to kill low enemies with. Oh yeah of course the prison (the forest) gym lead is lootable nowadays.
---
Huge let down. All hype, no substance
---
Spot lights in the turrets tab seem to help with targeting immensely.
---
Thank you! I really appreciate that
---
Now that's something I would like to see is actual developers or staff addressing issues that pop up to avoid rumors. Instead all we have to go by are posts. Even a "We are aware of the issue and plan a fix on this date..." kind of deal.
---
This was advertised as end game content for multiple high level players. A level 25 could run through it solo in 30 minutes. It's not what it was hyped to be.
---
I guess they wanted to make the first DLC mostly accessible to low levels/returning players, because if a guy who stopped playing after launch came back to play the new content and found that he was locked out for 20 more levels, he'd likely never come back to it.
---
Anyway, they did say that the Vaults will be instanced raids, so let's see if they keep their promise.
---
Just tried that and it worked! Thanks lol. But still it shouldn't have to be that way.
---
Sheepsquatch is actually the only place I'm getting Legendary robots regularly, though. An entire week, hundreds killed in Watoga, and nothing.  Sheepsquatch  I regularly get 2-3.
---
Thats seriously it? I solo'd this, pretty dissatisfied.
---
It's too tiny to be called shit. It's like a little stinky poo.
---
Give it a couple days, refine the idea and post again after the rush of the burrows dies down a little. That's what I do periodically about the bank idea so we can transfer items to our own characters. No idea takes off when first mentioned
---
That's because *it is* more fun to fall into a fissure.
---
Shhhhh. I have a hard enough time keeping that spot as it is lol
---
we hit it well before anyone else. was still an absolute cake walk. friend and i split up early to explore and just steam rolled everything.  Before we knew what had even happened the tunnel was empty and the quest completed.
---
Thank you. FYI - this is strictly PvE Adventure mode.
---
I'm at work and haven't played the new area yet. Given what I'm reading, it sounds like Bethesda is adding content that was intended for release, but had to cut due to tight timelines. As iconic as the Brotherhood was/is, their story should have been flushed out more - in my opinion. I hope the new vaults aren't similar to the Burrows.
---
\~Ad Victoriam
---
Where does it say dungeons are harder than silos?  Please tell me
---
It's not instanced so it's irrelevant when you have six or seven dudes all in there at once.
---
Oh that'd be awesome! Please share if you do. I have a collection of FO props I collect and made this to do sort of the same (print it out and glue it to something, ha)
---
How much you wanna bet I'll pm you my PayPal you pm yours and I'll stream a nuke later tonight.
---
Something like that. But then they would need to add some low level additions not including leaving them with events and the main story.

I live by the bathrooms with mine spawns at white springs and scorch beasts love fetting lunch my place
---
thanks :(
---
Don‚Äôt sound so deluded.  The dungeon is at least playable which at this point is all your even allowed to be thankful for in the realm of fo76.
---
Good luck Brother, you're gonna need some serious firepower on site to keep that base in operational shape!
---
If you sort by New, you'll see that everyone else is too ‚òπ
---
Oh haha, my bad!
---
Stop with that lie. Destiny strikes aka dungeons can be beaten in less than 30 mins. Most of the strikes you can solo by yourself with ease. Only reason it can take awhile to beat, is cause the bosses have different phases to them. Even so, you can beat a boss on their first phase if you do enough damage to them. I beat several bosses as soon as they entered the match. And no, I don't even have META weapons or gear. I just know to hit them hard until they die
---
We are getting instanced raids and dungeons. Too many people (myself included) thought the burrows would be one, but it was not. No sense in getting worked up over it, I'm just happy to have some new content, even if it's just a little bit.
---
Wait, people don't stand up to use their phone?
---
I hope so
---
Because that's what a dungeon is? Have you not played MMOs before? Dungeons are 5 minutes long with pathetically weak enemies.
---
The brewing dlc was short, but it was sweet and satisfying plus the first real content we ever had.
---
It's just when it comes to a dungeon, I expect it to last longer than a short quest that introduced to us a new crafting bench.
---
The length of "wasted on nukashine" was justifiable for its length since it gave us a new crafting bench, but a dungeon shouldn't make me feel like I wasted my time or that for some reason I skipped half of it without realizing it.
---
I hope this isnt what bethesda thinks endgame content is otherwise there will be issues and it will be even harder for us who are dedicated to this game to defend it.
---
Damn it all.
---
I find it's either really bad or runs for hours with nary a problem.  Nothing in between.  Often, when I get disconnected, it's just me and I can rejoin via friends (seriously, why do we still lack the option to rejoin the previous world?).
---
this. totally this.
---
Wow, such a disappointment...
---
Im InSuLtEd !1!!
---
These posts are boring instantly. Sheep is too hard!!! Dungeon too easy!!!
---
If you need more challenges in your life, go outside and do something real.
---
No problem, I didn‚Äôt mention that. I appreciate your input.
---
This is just a play to get us to buy Atoms for those items that expire rather than earn them.
---
Thankfully my minigun has deterred most threats. Just need to keep the ammo hungry beast fueled.
---
The OP concluded that additional factors, such as receiver type, should be factored in, thus YMMV.
---
If the Two-shot doesn't account for Hardened bonus damage, then yes, anti-armor is 1.36% better in terms of effective damage. If the versus doesn't account for the Hardened bonus damage, anti-armor is still 4.2% worse.
---
Try reading.
---
yeah i get that too, its a fine line to tread for bethesda for sure
---
i do hope people return to the game as well, if anything hopefully this dungeon will do that at least
---
So nerf yourself to that levl
---
I saw 3 and none greater than 1*
---
Jesus they still have the dailies related to the camera, even though they confirmed the delay a week ago? For God's sake Bethesda, you are literally crushing me today with your incompetence and tone deaf decisions.
---
One thing I will share, since the nodes are instanced, is Lucky Hole Mine. Depending on how many spawn for you, you can get 70-120 lead ore if wearing Excavator armor, and with Super Duper can turn that into about 700+ lead.
---
Another good lead source, just north of the above mentioned mine, is the monorail elevator. If you go to the third level there are approximately 20+/- weights.
---
Probabaly the 20 plus spawns of enemies? Like I get we all like jokes but this place is definently farmable
---
He's a griefer
---
They have responded to a different thread about the issue.
---
Men, women and Survivors.
---
If you're level 30 with a Meta build or a fresh level 50.. Gather maybe 1 Stimpak - and your dullest weapons.
---
Feast your eyes on the glory that is 5 minutes, and enjoy the pillow fight that is before you. 
---
Fear not - once you complete this heavy task.. we will bestow a 1* Vampire's Assaultron Blade titled "The Gutter".
---
Me and this other guy got in quickly before it got flooded by players (still on the same sever, but they're all gone now) and we also found the key, but could not find a single place to use it. We did so many loops and nothing... God I hope Bethesda comes out saying "Woooooot you doin? Look its just over deeer de new boss n raid yeeee" but I doubt they will, I think that was it for the burrows...
---
I've done the middle man thing for strangers on Xbox, they are always so surprised in the end on how honest I was, even switching caps from one character to another.  
---
My only advice is the one thing I always tell them to do:  Record the entire exchange and keep any text messages we've sent to each other for a small peace of mind. 
---
Sure it won't get your items back, but you'll have evidence of how slimy they are and can warn others or get them blacklisted in the trading forums.
---
I saw 2
---
Oh please. The fanatical Bethesda yes men will gladly gobble up anything remotely pro-Bethesda with little evidence, if any at all, supporting it. Anything that seems to remotely paint Bethesda in a less than rosey light though? Better have a mountain of evidence to have even the slightest chance they won't react like monkeys eager to throw their own feces at you.
---
Only trade sorry, looking for combat rifle with vats prefixes.
---
Oh wait - the challenges are for the PLAYERS?  Bethesda thought those were for the DEVELOPERS
---
(It's okay, I can say that joke - I have a friend who is a developer.)
---
Get ready for Skyrim on waterpainting!
---
Where is the dungeon located?
---
Not really too rare.
---
All you need is the sacraficial machette mod.
---
Never. Enjoy your new life.
---
Yeah I would agree with that difficulty, that‚Äôs probably ideal. I probably wasn‚Äôt clear enough with what I meant by ‚Äúsuper challenging‚Äù in the original comment. I meant like going well past the encryptid event.
---
I have 2 different 4* machete one vampire and the other troubleshooters
---
He said not to worry because it just works
---
for real....
---
Shhh. It's hard enough to find a virgin server to farm plastic. Stop putting all the good spots out there for everyone to read. And for goodness sake, don't mention Ft Defiance or Watoga HS, either.
---
I'd like the old Mojave Express drop boxes to be brought back in some way. I
---
f they could implement it so that you could also use the drop box to sent stuff to other characters you own, or people you are friends with. That would be even better.
---
I ran through it twice. 20 is a massive exaggeration. Maybe 10 enemies before you get to the last room.
---
? I've done the entire thing scourged for all the notes (like none in there, maybe one) only got a few holotapes and read the couple terminals and did the quest? What else should I read?
---
I didn't even get a legendary spawn. Whitesprings is better for ghouls than this.
---
You sound far more like a BoS Knight than a Responder. Come, join the movement of purity as we cleanse the wasteland of aberrations and Raiders.
---
I overcome it by fleeing every time I see another player, haha.
---
It's for a locked gate just before you have to turn the valve to open the security door.  If it's already opened s ok mekne already beat you to it.
---
Sadly it turns out they were not on the map and I spent a lot of time running around for nothing lol oh well you live and you learn
---
The mod always adds one star to any type of machete so it isn't that rare, you just have to have a 3\* machete
---
This is the most thought out advice I've ever heard. Thanks my life has changed
---
Damn I just sold a few of those!
---
or add "with any build"
---
This post didn't age well. And it has only been 3 hours.
---
The burrow?
---
Same, glad I‚Äôm not the only one. I was going mad.
---
i got a level 45 shishkabob! One star.......................
---
I know a really good junk mode on nice flat ground. I don't use it anymore, but when I did I never once had to server hop. Whst platform are you on?
---
That's so fucking disappointing.
---
It's not instanced...
---
We may be the only humans in Appalachia, but we're not the only humans in the world. Plenty of non-vault dwelling humans survived the apocalypse, and went on to form communities all over the US. The thing that makes Appalachia unique is The Scorched, an organized and incredibly powerful threat that specifically seeks out humans to destroy. The Scorched were strong enough to wipe out the virginia chapter of the BoS, and so what hope would other humans have of surviving? 
---
Sure, down the line more vaults could open or or well off organizations of people could travel by land or air to Appalachia, but why would they fare any better? The west coast BoS were in contact with the Virginia BoS and know how dangerous the region is, so they wouldn't waste resources stopping by. The Enclave is busy gathering their strength out west and up north, and with the incurable rampancy induced in MODUS they have no reason to come by either. If a vault opens up, odds are they'd be quickly killed by the scorched or other threats since they're not usually hardened fights. So, point is, lore wise it wouldn't make much sense for other NPCs. The lack of humans is a huge plot point in the game.
---
I went through the whole thing thinking it was the sewer to get to the entrance of the dungeon. It was basically like clearing out whitesprings after a nuke minus the rads. Neat looking place but i was dumbfounded for 2 minutes till i realized they dumped me back outside.
---
Are you able to place it down in your camp? , or is it just a buy in the atom shop to show you've logged in today?
---
That's what I was afraid of - if it's not an instanced dungeon, it will just have people coming in and out all day, respawning things and completing things. Just like the encryptid event is impossible without 40 minutes of server hopping to find the one server in your country where it isn't on cooldown
---
ma ri 1st option last option..could have the last wrong
---
Yeah i thought of that aswell, i dont use pistols but dual wielding would make it more interesting
---
Does sitting provide any purpose or in-game bonuses?
---
Perhaps there should a ‚Äúslightly rested‚Äù bonus similar to well rested, but it‚Äôs +2.5% xp bonus for 30 minutes. There are plenty of places to sit, not many ‚Äúclean‚Äù beds to sleep on in the wasteland.
---
About the same
---
Yeah, I agree. Its always going to be this way though.
---
 There‚Äôll always be casual players who prefer a easier and smoother experience and then there‚Äôll be ‚Äúsurvival difficulty‚Äù group of players who prefer a hard and challenging experience.
---
I‚Äôve yet to try out the new dungeon, but it sounds quite easy, so it‚Äôll probably be right up my alley. If it gives me one more thing to do in this game, I‚Äôll be happy.
---
IF the BoS couldn't do this, no surprise they were all killed...
---
Hard question to answer.  Social anxiety usually doesnt happen on the internet as most escape it by going on the internet.
---
My only advice to you is do not care about what other people think.  Yeah, kind of rough advice i know, but if your afraid of other people who you will never even see your probably just afraid of what they will think of you.
---
I am a manipulator, i change how i speak and act depending on the goal of the conversation.  Some people are just dicks or need to hurt others to feel better, some enjoy helping others for nothing in return.  Means to an end maybe?  I have many friends but few real friends, but being the guy people trust without a second guess and can cash in favors is never a bad thing.
---
Fair but you can still force respawns
---
Its not a dungeon its a guest.
---
300 hours into the game and 8ve only ever met one rude person , the community is great everyone is super nice. What I've gotten into recently in the game is rp become a ghoul talk in a harsh gravely tone . Hides yourself from others if that's what you're afraid of .
---
There's this new year's anniversary suit bundle available in atomic shop for 800 atoms I think? Kinda matches your description. You might want to check it out
---
It was a Atom Store deal, but possibly the Tuxedo set?
---
Nahh public dungeons in eso throw generally a ton of enemies at you and several bosses. This was maybe a delve.
---
There are two short quest that I know of. Southern Bell hotel and Toxic Larry's  are the place to go
---
not a clue, had to extend a bridge to get there. On another run i found the door open. nothing interesting inside...
---
Play eso then. The mmo ran by zenimax. Bethesda‚Äôs parent company
---
At the Fallout 76 panel a few weeks ago Todd talked about implementing instancing for vault raids, so that tech is coming down the pipeline - just not yet.
---
It's hilarious how all the fanatical yes men just refuse to believe that the spawns *haven't* been merged despite all the people claiming to have farmed an insane number of Sativa spawns without a single legendary robot. They must think this is some elaborate conspiracy to besmirch Bethesda's good name. The mental gymnastics are astounding.
---
So I‚Äôm not in your exact situation, but I do want to mention this was my first ever online game. And I was also worried, but 1) you really don‚Äôt have to talk to/work with others if you don‚Äôt want to. It makes it slightly harder, but I managed. 2) any people I *have* run into are great, they‚Äôre helpful, and I‚Äôve gotten plenty of gifts to help me out along the way. 
---
One example is that I was in a Nuke, ran out of ammo, and went on my mic to ask if anyone had any. Someone dropped over 1000 of that ammo for me! 
---
As for the pace, it‚Äôs fine to just explore at whatever pace you want to. You can turn on pacifist mode and avoid PVP all together! Go from location to location, collect junk and weapons, and just enjoy the beautiful map.
---
We got a few legendary enemies but honestly it wasn't worth the effort.
---
Yeah, many mechanics in this game are fairly obscure. I remember dataminers and testers trying to figure it out, but as far as I'm aware there is still a lot relatively unknown. Combine that with the influx of new people over the past few months, and there's little general understanding of the game. Might be helpful if somebody made a specific guide for it all.
---
Alright I'll look at it. Thank you!
---
Were you not saying they would be "new" enemies?
---
I think people were under the impression that it was "instanced" as in "You have a private instance of this area to play through with your group" 
---
This is not the case. The area is a simple "room" that you are teleported to via the door in the overworld.
---
Someone hasn‚Äôt played Minecraft. /s
---
Sure, but not any time soon.
---
I will say I did use my tse handmade so it is partially me using strong weapons.  But I can use the same gun in a nuke silo and still feel like it's a challenge this dungeon... feels like it should've been in the forest instead of the mire
---
I have taken more difficult shits then this dungeon, seriously plays like just another place on the map which a high level player walks through barely having to take one hand from the mid walk wank in order to clear.
---
Add nipple lasers to the boss and up it's level by triple and we are talking.  
---
Oh and make it oddly sexually excited if the player is carrying a toaster.
---
Ah, I see.
---
I could be wrong, but seem to remember next to the church in flatwoods you will see evidence that the pre-scorched people were capable of cultivating it without scientific equipment like in say the agricultural center where they were growing the ridiculously useful firecap mushroom.
---
Ah, bummer.
---
Just did it solo, level 130. The final enemy was a non-legendary level 46 bot, are you serious, I got a ripper as a quest reward too.
---
Gotta say, naught too pleased.
---
I smell Troll shit.
---
Aren't the burrows located in the forest? Why would anyone expect that level of difficulty in the forest?
---
I enjoyed the hell out of it - up until the point it ended, and there i was thinking i was just starting to scratch the surface and looking forward to fighting tooth and nail through much more content.
---
Spend another 20 minutes wondering around convinced i had to find something to continue - but nope.
---
Then i went from enjoying it to pure sour
---
I went solo as level 100 with an op wepaon , but it was easier than a silo run
---
Gotta say that while I do enjoy this game, I am certainly also disappointed with these ‚Äúcontent‚Äù drops. Less than an hour worth of new stuff just feels...underwhelming. Hopefully they‚Äôll drop something beefy soon.
---
I bought the Garrahan paint and the raider one. Kept the limbs garrahan and the torso and helmet raider.
---
Instance mean, there is like separated server for dungeon. Like when you enter dungeon, you character is being teleported to new temporary server with dungeon content, that is accessible either only to you or to you and your party/group members. When you leave the instanced dungeon or finish it, you are being teleported back to main world.
---
Why not take it a step further and have online vending, trading and etc.? 
---
But hey a pip boy would be ballin'
---
&gt;e greater than 1\*
---
I saw three - 1 was a 3 star at the start for me - rest were 1 star. Rewards were all 1 star crap so not worth it.
---
Apparently the last two options were 11 and 17! I got the MARI bit on my own but never the numbers XD
---
It can also be easily cheesed just being a shotgun based build too. Especially if you specialize in crippling legs like MaTN's build.
---
Does anyone know how long it takes for enemies to respawn after completing?
---
Can you get the mission again or is it a spawn farm point now?
---
Dude.....
---
where did you think the cores would go
---
I use rifles... they die before my power armor gets hit... I can do it naked and it's just as easy.
---
No stims used so far, only one-shot kills. Gutsies were a bit tougher, but 2 shots in the thruster is all it takes. Lvl **36** assaultron is a joke.
---
Lawl
---
So glad I never bothered...lol
---
It‚Äôs Mari 1117 if you read the paper
---
Wow, look at how much hate I got just for saying give them a break, LoL. Even though I still fully agreed with what everyone was saying, that one little sentence got so many people all butthurt üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
*Walks around and hands out ass cream to all the butthurt folks*
---
It'll be alright guys. Just apply a thin coat of the ass cream once a day for about a week, and all will be fine üëç
---
Devs should really be ashamed. Half a year and only 1 night contents, even the sheepsquatch which was far better than this. And that doesn't mean it was really good. I'm sad and disappointed like always with this game
---
I was just looking for at least half of what was featured in the trailer. Maybe some people hyped it up, but my expectation was what was teased in the trailer for Wild Appalachia. All the released content hasn‚Äôt been far off what‚Äôs been in the trailer. This has
---
I wanted to see at least what happened to the rest of there squad, oof
---
So you're response to Bethesda massively messing this up is "then play another game"? So if someone hits your car do they get to just say "drive another car"?
---
Stop acting like this is anywhere near what Bethesda promised.
---
Thats what the problem is. Bethesda didn't even attempt to deliver on their promise. It's not anywhere near what they promised it to be, which is a dungeon that 2 50+ players MIGHT finish
---
&gt; whether it's just a bug is the debate.
---
It's not even worth debating‚Äîwhether it was intentional or not doesn't matter; should still be fixed regardless.
---
now how do we get the rest of the headmounts
---
I plan to sit in stealth using my Bluetooth microphone while taking a shit each morning... add to the atmosphere.
---
Alright im heading there now ive scaled this entire "dungeon" twice lol
---
Yep I'm aware, I got the Mari bit just never the numbers!
---
This had me laughing...sad but true
---
I didn't see any
---
I killed one with a crown that was 3\*. But that's the only legendary I found during 1 attempt. I'm guessing it may be a bit random.
---
That flower door was totally from BETA.  I wonder what else will be brought back from that time period?  (come on fez hat and Blackbird Power Armor skin).
---
ü§ûüèª
---
One was saved because he ate the guy instead of reviving him. The other was saved because he ate the guy and refilled his own health.
---
I just use an instigating PF and one shot everything. I think I got down to 80% HP at the lowest... thought it would be much harder
---
Yeah you'd sit in your camp and post memes of  radscorpions and mole rat chunks all day. Ppsts about supermutants thinking theyre all that
---
Is delayed
---
I got 3 sold one for 2500caps. Weak damage, fun to use. Get 3star machete and server hop at herpes fery vendor for mod that cost 120caps
---
God damn do I feel stupid now :/ haha
---
This was a real busy. It amazes me they built such a cool looking area and then stocked it with trash monsters and no teal challenge so to speak. 10 min silo here because I don't read the directions lol
---
Maybe or maybe not, depends on how you want to interpret it.
---
lol people here were expecting it to be a raid but it was blatantly obvious it was basically just a new area being added.
---
There is currently no content in the game that really requires a healer type character.
---
Level 1 Born survivor or autostim armor and some stimpacks take care of everything
---
Used no power armor and I got hit once for like 10pts of damage.
---
This might stem from mods that read "core assembly" or something of that nature while not specifying which type of PA it's for.
---
I think I'm just going to hide in the burrows in survival and kill everyone at see. Is there another content than that? Full of anger now
---
Yes, it is a floor decoration located in the same line as the Deathclaw statue. I put mine on a table but haha!
---
How do you function in the real world then??
---
It‚Äôs because you close your eyes and instantly know every single town in wv before you even discover them, and know all of wv even though you were born in vault 76
---
When it comes out, there's an article out there that states you have to "find the dead tourist who‚Äôs holding the camera, which leads to a quest that will have you completing a list of specific snapshots." I have no idea where they will be though.
---
At 57, I thought I might be the oldest.  Not even close, met someone who was 70+.  Keep your valuable junk stored and take a chance.  I'm really enjoying the multiplayer.  Use a mic, I've had some great conversations with random players (but still run into a few trash talking teens).
---
Same here. Ran it 5 times and I'll probably never go back. Absolutely no fun had at all, so much so that i turned off my ps4 and im gonna do some yardwork. That's right, I'd rather go work outside than play
---
Yes, they just said a bit ago that it was not instanced. My reaction was similar.
---
I keep feeling like they're going to make amends with all the crap that's been going wrong but on top of this less-than release, they messed up more stuff with the last patch and the server stability has gone down again.
---
Sike, look at the daily and weekly quests
---
For how long?
---
They never said it was going to be instanced and nothing indicated it would be.
---
Check the weekly and daily
---
Level 100+, only wearing combat armour &amp; using a suppressed lever-action. Had no issue pushing through the ghouls and had very little resistance. 10/76 would rather have gone unarmed.
---
Well said.
---
Maybe the mods will finally do something
---
[Spoilers: they won‚Äôt]
---
we arent asking for realism in this game
---
this sub just has a hard on for extremism
---
My money is on something bigger in the future. There was no download or patch or anything telling me this is like a beta maybe and in the future they‚Äôll add to it. In the meantime I did get this nifty toothpick. üò∂
---
Seriously how big of a nerd do you have to be to complain about a game engine?  Like how many youtube videos do you watch to think that's a viable argument?  Out of all the issues with the game you pick that?
---
...uh
---
Dungeon size was no more than a 5 at best I would rate Glassed mine an 8 and it wasn‚Äôt that large either
---
Lol. I did that same thing last weekend. At least with yardwork youll actually feel a real sense of accomplishment.
---
Its not too bad. Unless you have to kill 50 chickens
---
Haha took me a couple minutes to think where the bitch hiding haha
---
You must've dreamt it because they literally never said it was instanced.
---
can't cripple the queen.
---
Well yeah, which is pretty unfortunate. Doing things like that would mean a lot to the community, but really would not cost them all that much, it's not as if 20c can but you much on their shop. It's strange how the 76 community can be so supportive in some ways and so defensive in others.
---
PC, but I'm on a lead deposit right next to a random encounter location, two excellent super mutant hunting locations, 5 cap fast travel from White Spring Station and (if you stop off for goodies along the way) 6 caps from Watoga. Rarely any nasties besides the occasional mole rat, and my pet sloth makes short work of them; I haven't had to repair my CAMP besides a couple of razorgrain in a couple of weeks.
---
It's a really prime location. When I posted about it previously, I had two different people on r/fo76filthycasuals complain I was giving away their spot too.
---
Clear you know nothing about any of the lore lmao. A lot of people survived the Bombs dropping, the game isn‚Äôt an MMO, and the scorched plague is why there are no humans. Did you actually pay attention when playing the game?
---
...? Isn't that what I said?
---
I mean I wear the bomber jacket . . . You have a point
---
You are not alone, friend.
---
I believe you can start the quest at Toxic Larry‚Äôs Meat and Go as well
---
Are you sure you had stimpaks available? Revives won't take diluted or supers for a pick up.
---
What they should do is make respectable content
---
Okay - Well unfortunate for everyone who has already gone through it, I'm gonna change my expectations and treat it as a side quest in the game already. I've not even made it to the town that this area is located in yet.
---
Still have so much to do.
---
Eh not really wanting to bet, I'm just saying Charleston is a solid nuke spot
---
Inside the capital building is infested with enemies 
---
Also good amount of flux outside too
---
Who is dying in there? What level are you?
---
Nonsense, anyone who can clear high lv non-nuked Whitesprings Gold Club can solo Burrows in 5-10min with no difficulty at all. Power armor or not.
---
Man, they are really dropping the ball on new content development. When I heard that there would be content updates (i.e., new questlines) and all DLC would be free, I wasn't expecting to get a Far Harbor or Nuka World sized DLC but I was at least expecting to get content that would take me more than 1 day (or part of a day) to complete. I think Lying Lowe and all the related quests took me about 5 hours or less? This sounds like its even shorter, and not much replay value. And these are like the two major content additions until the fall? Underwhelming to say the least.
---
Instanced dungeons are not new either.
---
The first time I saw some of them was  in 2001 in a mmorpg called Anarchy Online, but maybe the also existed earlier.
---
Sounds interesting. Maybe we can be allies? We can possibly help each other out.
---
My mom used to say that when i had chores to do...
---
And it's true
---
To be completely fair, the players represented on this sub are not exactly the average 50+ player. An average random would not have optimized SPECIAL or Perks and be running whatever armor they have patched together by that point.
---
This was not the raids, those come later. I would think of this as more of an alternative farming ground for when Watoga or Whitesprings get too crowded.
---
More half-assed Bethesda "content"
---
its not an odd place when they have several community managers specifically looking for feedback.
---
You are completely wrong.  This is a valid game mechanic and player interaction.  Reporting is for genuine harassment (racial, sexual, religious etc).
---
I would still think about getting a dense torso mod. Fireproof might be overkill for PvE yeah.
---
Wasn‚Äôt it always two legendaries? One from the quest one from her body? I remember only 200 caps so that‚Äôs a plus.  Always got stims too. And got atleast one prime plan and one ultracite plan.  It‚Äôs pretty consistent?
---
The whole key to my heart gave it away lol. But yeah, random guessing till it worked
---
Just finished the quest, and had already done a run w/o picking up the quest - FYI the dead brotherhood corpse as soon as you zone in has the note to start it.
---
A bit disappointing, I was expecting something hard.  But I'm lvl 181.
---
It's mostly ghouls and then some gutsies at the end.  There did seem to be more legendaries than you'd find in other locations like WesTek or Watoga.  And I got an AA Tesla.
---
But the bum rush of 20 ghouls at whitesprings is harder.  I kind of hope they do implement something stupid hard they don't think anyone can do, just to give us a challenge.
---
It's like they're too afraid to pack an area with extremely high level enemies and I don't know why.
---
They seem to make every bit of new content doable by basically everyone above level 40, solo. 
---
They need to stop being pussies and make an actual challenge that isn't doable as a solo player.
---
Imagine the smell from decades of users with no fucking toilets, the kinda patina that cannot be simulated.
---
Then you seal yourself inside it to engage in that dynamic atmosphere.  Or add your own after that sixteen glowing steak :D
---
I've just popped my one down by that Fasnacht bonfire thing, I hope to get all 7 and just surround the burning mask with colourful   e g g s
---
Half assed would imply that they even started with the first half
---
Am i missing something or are there just exactly 2 BoS People down there at the entrances? Must have been a crazy mission.
---
No, they're not
---
No wonder the Brotherhood lost. They couldn't even clear out 15 ghouls.
---
actually i have more energy and ballistic defense out of my PA  so i guess i should put on some low lvl raider PA make it a challenge
---
Super Sike! Read u/BethesdaReplied comments.
---
Jesus, you are whining like a 10 year old over a game, YOU WON‚ÄôT EVEN USE THE FEATURE IF THEY ADD IT, WHY DO YOU WANT PEOPLE WHO SIT OFTEN NOT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. it‚Äôs so simple, if you don‚Äôt like something don‚Äôt say it at all. That‚Äôs something my 4TH GRADE TACHER SAID grow up.
---
But do we at least get a 55" 4k tv for 200$ when were done? Or just alot of shame and emotional scarring?
---
I'm not sure the tech even supports Instanced locations.  
---
Anyone name a single place in game that is Instanced?  Even Vault 76 is shared space.
---
That works for me. Just get on when you can. I‚Äôll be on then
---
This is cool thank you! üòä
---
Unfortunately Lady what's-her-name confirmed these were an oversight and Cameras are still postponed to the 26th
---
Todd Howard himself did. On a Bethesda panel. Cant remember which Con
---
He also reliably spawns across from the Poseidon workshop. He's there at least one time everytime I'm in game.
---
Nope, they're planned for next week, they just got slipped in accidentally today. Sorry OP!
---
Wait, so our dailies are filled with things we CANNOT do? What the hell...
---
That is the only perfectly acceptable radio glitch that should be allowed.
---
the Esquilax
---
&gt; I was looking forward to a challenging, instanced dungeon with some sort of mechanic to complete 
---
Challenging and mechanics, yes.
---
But instanced? They never indicated **anywhere** that it would be instanced.
---
No they didn't. The vault raids are
---
Of course PvP is the culprit behind most nerfs/ QQing well sounds like what they need to do is disable them for survival moad or put a decent CD on them in survival mode. Because the repair kits themself aren't the issue survival mode is.
---
it‚Äôs like Bethesda doesn‚Äôt want us to enjoy this game
---
Adamantium Skeleton is probably the only good one.  The sun perks are cute, thats about it.  Total removal of limb damage for melee build is a must if you did not opt for an agility melee build.
---
The indication is based on the assumption for a standard that has been a model in the MMO/MMO Lite industry for the last 15+ years. 
---
If someone compares their content to a Dungeon - which they did, then there is a precedence set. Dungeon, Strike - whatever the case may be. They all follow very specific guidelines for how they operate. Instanced - and catered/crafted content.
---
During The stream at PAX they were also talking about something at Arktos Pharma, I wonder what it is
---
Wrong sub, try r/marketplace76
---
?
---
The problem with sheepsquatch was the terrible uncontrollable life sucking mechanics. It‚Äôs like they designed it for you to die. Not immersive
---
No. No name = Excavator armor.
---
Read what I said again.
---
Haha nice. Ill prolly put a few up n thats about it. Had to put my bonfire away for that budget lol
---
Dont know yet just says to a further date
---
man i wish i was todd
---
Soloish, there were a couple of other people down there as it had just gone live. The new area is really quite nice but the quest is laughable. The trouble is it's been designed for level 50's, not level 100+ so it is going to get stomped through.
---
I was thinking the same thing, but if you have to go thru a loading screen to get in then it won't have an effect.
---
Running sentinals armour, took no dmg. Using gunfu and grim reapers sprint, just headshoting every ghoul and refilling my ap for infinite VATs.
---
Yep. I was so bummed out when I lost all my pics. Live and learn.
---
First id like to say i entered and explored the entire place by myself so i had access to all the mobs.  All i saw where non legendary ghouls... thinking it was just spaced out  like whitesprings with even less payout. Simple filler till you get to the good stuff maybe but that ended up being the meat of the dungeon. Never really overwhelming maybe one or 2 rooms i had 5-6 on me at once. When you get to the robot section theres a legendary that spawns closest to the door entrance. He spawned twice once for me when i  solo'd it then that room for some reason respawned when my buddy entered the door. Only the first time did it drop a crappy black powder one star pistol. Second kill he was empty.  The quest weapon would be the trophy if it did any good damage. Instead ill stick to the all american or 50% armor pen wardrum.  I received nothing else other then basic whitesprings junk i typically collect. Overall it was more underwhelming than my normal farm spots. Maybe a change of pace at best but odds are itll be overun for awhile. 
---
I really hope this isn't the raiding were going to expect from the vaults. I was hoping for some sewer mutant variety or at least a new boss event type.  This was more like exploring a typical building in any of the fallout series.  The only challenge was a damage benchmark via swarms which is just insulting.
---
This guy fucks
---
I actually think it was a mistake, but yeah. Kinda ridiculous.
---
&gt;Last week: Sheepsquatch is to hard, one shots aren‚Äôt fun, I can‚Äôt do it solo, trash rewards, not worth using the stimpacks
---
I liked how hard Sheepsquatch was. I thought it was a trial run for The Burrows. I am disappoint.
---
I did a crawl through on my first play of burrows. Found some lore regarding community politics and links in with another settlement in the game (no spoilers), but that was about it?
---
Interesting. I've never heard or seen this anywhere.
---
Noticed this too when logging in. So we are just gonna have to eat the loss on Atoms on this one given the camera isn‚Äôt released?
---
Aye. Bethesda confirmed a little while ago that the camera challenges are not supposed to be in the game yet.
---
Is it really really short, or was there really only one Mission down there? I only have the one Mission Waste Management which took me less than 10 minutes, and almost all of the enemies down there had been killed by a different player.
---
Not to seem ungrateful for the New Missions at all, I love the area. But I've been looking forward to this for a while and all I've gotten is 10 minutes content?
---
&gt;They need to stop being pussies and make an actual challenge that isn't doable as a solo player.
---
In doing that they will alienate over half of the fall out playerbase. Wouldn't be wise.
---
Take your timeüòÇ
---
Yea, that was a bummer for me too. Live and learn.
---
"The Burrows is balanced to be a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault Dwellers, but truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone. If you manage to emerge victorious, you‚Äôll receive plenty of loot and experience for your troubles. The quest can only be completed once, but after it‚Äôs finished you can repeat the dungeon as many times as you‚Äôd like for even more loot and XP."
---
That really makes it sound that way tho. From the Fallout 76 website.
---
I want to believe that this is BGS underestimating the skills of their playerbase, but in reality it's probably just them being lazy af.
---
They keep hoping it'll get better but it never does. At the point where people thank Bethesda for re-adding basic features lol
---
Yeah. Its beyond comical at this point.
---
Great arguments. Too bad it all falls apart in the first sentence... you see, this isn't a MMO. Don't get me wrong, I agree with you. Totally. But Bethesda won't, because they are not trying to make this into a MMO. They have ESO, which has tons better group content, dungeons and raids, and they are not even trying to copy what they did right in that game, so obviously they are not trying to head into MMO territory. 
---
For them, this is simply... Fallout with Friends.
---
Hey don't worry. I am 58. What I found was that getting a set of headphones with a microphone make the communication very simple. I have met may different players: 12 year-old's  with brothers yelling at them to to 56 year-olds. Talk about the game or talk about the weather. Enjoy yourself
---
Yes. That's exactly what it is. 
---
geezuz H, the melodrama on this forum is tween girl level.
---
The game has always had crashing issues since Fallout 3 (uses same engine).
---
It‚Äôs a vague error, it could be related to the fact Windows 7 technically stopped support in 2015, and is only running on extended support until January of 2020 (next year).  Fallout 76 uses DirectX 11 which was only backported to Windows 7, so its one of those ‚Äòold system issue and no one is going to fix it‚Äô or you just have the same luck as anyone who has launched a nuke and the game/server just dies.
---
ESO plays absolutely nothing like this game. This is the dumbest possible response.
---
Yeah, sitting at 430dmr out of power armor, ghouls only deal rad dmg... Ghouls can't get close when you blow off their legs...
---
As far as we know vaults are planned to be first instanced things. Maybe only instanced things.
---
I‚Äôll call bullshit.
---
Not on purpose but a clear case of the left hand not knowing what the right hands doing. Whoever the day to day operator of this game is is failing fantastically. Poor communication another missed deadline. I think its time for a performance review.
---
Terrible design of a non-instanced dungeon from Bethesda. Honestly wouldn‚Äôt try running that dungeon until the newness wears off or Bethesda implements an instance system for it.
---
I'm sure their fusion cores played a small role in their defeat; you can only do so much if all your cores are only at 25%. Ha-ha!
---
Because no matter what they have people defending them, claiming anyone who tries to call out their BS is just "on the fo76 hate train". They will continue to pull dumb shit like this because it continues to be profitable for them.
---
So as long as you got the people in this subreddit that will come yell at anyone who says this game has serious issues stemming from the way beth has been doing things with this game. At this point it almost looks like they are TRYING to make this game bomb on purpose, I honestly can't believe they didn't do any research on how to properly implement online play in an online multiplayer game like this.
---
This game isn't an MMO. It has MMO features.
---
This game already HAD dungeons before this. They aren't the same as a WoW dungeon. 
---
Fallout 4 had "dungeons". Quincy was a dungeon. Libertalia was a dungeon. Corvega plant was a dungeon.
---
Therefore, I knew when they say "dungeon" here, they mean an interior area with lots of enemies that respawn. They're just making Fallout 4s definition of dungeons. 
---
Ok, but that's down to knowing Fallout 4 and making assumptions. What about some actual facts?
---
Well, Bethesda literally said they're MAKING instancing for the upcoming vault raids. They **never** said this was instanced. Never implied it.
---
I just fought him at level 29 with a friend. We died a couple times but eventually got the best of him.
---
Lol I'm saying it's against the main design of the game. Bethesda said the whole point of not including human npcs is to show the only humans are real players. Which is definitely an  interesting gimmick but compared to other online games there isn't enough content.
---
From a game design perspective they want to keep the fact all humans you come across are real players and not generic npcs. Obviously almost everyone that has played 76 has played other games so it wouldn't be critical thinking.
---
That's been happening all week, this is just a little more blatant.
---
Fallout 76 is the real world for a lot of us, lol
---
They should instance it and scale the difficulty to the player/group doing it. There's nothing worse than being hyped to do a cool dungeon and once inside realise that there are 10 other players inside that already killed everything.
---
Suppose that makes it more challenging lol
---
No problem.
---
Same.  Sigh.
---
I called chief and he said this ain‚Äôt it.
---
&gt;This is a   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;very  
---
&gt; basic area in any fallout game that can be thrown together over a weekend by a single person. A week with QA work (PS, there's a void visible in the water tunnel on the cafeteria side).
---
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
---
OK, then do it then. If it's so easy.
---
A place like that oughtta be damp as the dew, with danger aplenty.
---
You mean the challenges that they added for camera...that got postponed
---
Same.  Just the quest reward sword.
---
Sometimes I forget how to stand up and I‚Äôm stuck in the chair until I pass out from malnutrition
---
I like this one too. But why not make it like greyhound used to. Rent the locker for day or untill you open it again. Easy way for the game to get caps back and control how much you transfer. If you don't collect it right away, you lose it. Keeps from overloading any one server I would think.
---
Yep if you look in the terminal at birthday gifts you can see Mari's birthday for the numbers. This was actually a nice little puzzle. And a good, creepy ending. Overall enjoyed this side quest the most from all of them so far!
---
&gt; It's like they're too afraid to pack an area with extremely high level enemies and I don't know why.
---
Because the work they were doing to support the instancing apparently isn't finished yet and instead of punting it to another release they just opened it up as a regular load area to have content out there.
---
After the rush calms down it will be better. But they need to get some of this stuff in game.
---
Instanced dungeons are important.
---
I‚Äôm level 90 and I‚Äôm rocking a level 30 fixer around most of the map, prefer it to my sole survivor, can‚Äôt wait until I finally get the plans..
---
I like this idea too! We could even have an old post office you have to go to drop off the mail. Implement a Postal Worker Protection that hangs out near the post office boxes/building and says funny comments about the costs, patriotism, etc. Typical fallout jokes.
---
Very very dissatisfied with this addition. It was way to small and way to easy didn't need a team for it like they suggested it was a cake walk.
---
I actually agree with this. I havent done it yet - But honestly I havent really started farming Whitesprings yet, and I'm level 64. I hear Whitesprings is always populated so if it serves no other purpose then spreading people out. I'm good. Even if it doesn't do that...I'm still good lol
---
The level challenges are frequently easier than you think. Timing your level up around certain conditions can get you the challenge completion with a single level up.
---
The people on this sub that whine about needing other players are the minority. It's their attempt at a Fallout MMO-lite. It should fucking have at least SOME content that ISN'T SOLOABLE and is VERY HARD.
---
Otherwise theres no fucking point. I'm very glad they said raids will be instanced and require a group. Because if raids were easy and doable solo then I'd fucking quit.
---
I'd genuinely bet money on it that if they made very hard group required content like a good raid, MORE people would come to the game. You guys on this sub would bitch and cry, saying they betrayed player 1 or whatever, but I guarantee you a lot of people that hate the game would at least consider getting it if it worked like an actual mmo.
---
Hey man, Apex is a good game.
---
How?
---
Literally nothing there makes it sound like it's instanced. 
---
Imma need you to elaborate.
---
Garbage! Biggest let down yet! Got some lame ass assaultron blade and a random 1* legendary from the only multi stared legendary in the whole thing!!! Boo to this!
---
Its not out....
---
They put the damage on a curve table so low end of hps got a slight boost but higher hp ranges had considerably lower damage.  May have been good for min/maxers but for 99% of the population it was a nerf.
---
.
---
Kid you got on Reddit today and started making multiple posts crying and demanding shit like a child who doesn‚Äôt understand how the world works. Then you tried to backtrack and hide it by deleting your posts. Gtfo here lol no one values what you have to say because of your shit attitude. üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº
---
People would plant their stuff there and leave it for days, weeks, or whatever. Soon all the lockers are full and no one can use them. Or worse, someone puts 1 spoiled vegetable in each and every locker then walks away laughing.
---
A timer keeps them open for all to use.
---
Yep. I Was able to solo it at level 63, running level 35 armor because I have nothing else with deep pockets, and did just fine. Took about 10 minutes give or take.
---
How do you start the quest
---
Lol. Take a chill pill.
---
The dungeon itself I thought was great, they always excel with world building and environment. I wish the quest and difficulty were even close to the same level as the aesthetic
---
I am utterly fucking stuck on the passphrase only one letter is spawning for me after multiple server hops and it holds less than a single sheet of fucking toilet paper with liquid shits.
---
I'm not cool enough for minecraft
---
2 options. 
---
1. Wait for the content to be instanced as they finish up the instancing tech.
---
2. Enjoy the content and wait for the instancing tech to get done for future things.
---
Once I learned it wasn't instanced I popped over and found the manhole and peaked inside. I will be back when there is less of a grand central station feel down there. I solo explore for lore and story and don't like to be rushed.
---
I love the look and the vibe of the dungeon.
---
Any word on if the Sheepsquatch is finally active? Would love some new Cryptids to hunt.
---
Where is that one at? I‚Äôm having a bit of trouble today with brain thinking... had an oral surgery and pain meds are effing me up hard
---
That assumes a griefer is killing you to get caps. For some reason or another the popular Reddit belief is that griefing in a mixed PvPvE environment is any and all unwelcome PvP, so anyone who engages in PvP within the mechanics established by the game to accomplish the goals provided by developers for PvP is a griefer unless they ask you if you want to fight first.
---
When someone is griefing, and I mean *truly* griefing not just engaging in PvP, they're not doing it to get any kind of loot; they're trying to attack you in the most annoying way possible to piss you off. This is the guy who, despite the fact that you've now killed him 5 times, keeps re-spawning nearby and rushing in to fight you again. This is the guy who stands in a doorway in a game that doesn't let you walk through other players until you flag yourself for PvP so that he can kill you with his OP gear. This is the guy who hits you with a gut shot in a survival game and then stands over you and dances for 2 minutes to force you to wait for the bleed out, only to hunt you down and do it again. This is the guy who knows everyone spawns in the same general area, so he spawn kills you over and over again until you say "Fuck it" and change servers because it's just not fun anymore.
---
Repeatedly resurrecting and downing someone is absolutely something a legitimate griefer would do.
---
I think you may have hit the nail on the head there.
---
I'm used to forums, I've been a mod on a few, but actual interaction with people, mainly younger than me fills me dread, the annoying thing is I want to take part.
---
I think it's intimidating because I've avoided social games like C.O.D and it's ilk because all the stories I hear about trolls etc, the whole online chat thing is intimidating to me but from the replies, there's worse platforms to pop your Cherry on üòÜ
---
Some people are complaining  that they didn't get 3 star legendary loot, but I really didn't even that.  Some plans would have been just fine.   The BOS were in this location, so maybe plans for randomly generated BOS gear. BOS flag plans for the camp,  Maybe BOS combat armor plans.   Who knows?   Didn't have to be an OP weapon but good God.  A dungeon that you sleep walk through an a mediocre sword? Um... okay.
---
Wow. Armchair psychologist I see.
---
This issue needs its own subreddit at this point, lmao.
---
I put that to the test, and wish I had done it before the turret range improvement. I have noticed that the ground based enemies around my base stand no chance these days, but I think the cliff toppers are above the sight line of the spotlights.
---
Learn to take someone‚Äôs opinion, I‚Äôm not going to let anybody whine about why something shouldn‚Äôt be in a game because THEY aren‚Äôt going to use it.
---
I sincerely hope bethesda doesn't listen to you people then. Because if the game continues being an easy cakewalk where literally everything is soloable then it's due for an early death.
---
However, they have literally said the vault raids will be instanced and require a group. So cry all you want, but if they do turn out to be like that then the game is saved.
---
Right! Glad I only let myself get a half boner about a "dungeon" coming...
---
Kimball isn't alive for another 160+ years buddy.
---
i dont think im alone in this, but i was thinking something of raid level proportions. i feel this was a very loose use of the word ‚Äúdungeon‚Äù which in an MMO is very not O.K. Dungeon is a big word to use.
---
I was walking thru Whitesprings earlier today and a whole bunch of Protectrons and Mr Handy's keeled over dead.
---
Maybe there is a robotic flu going around.
---
He didn‚Äôt get passed the first 6-7 words rip
---
What's the melee
---
I'm fully aware it isn't an MMO. 
---
Fallout 4 had what you are personally dubbing a Dungeon. 
---
In a game with this style of gameplay, and connectivity with players.. precedents are set. Period. 
---
They literally verbatim said "Dungeon-esque". 
---
Like it or not - this is an MMO Lite. Just the same as Destiny, The Division. They are not full scale MMOs. But it most definitely falls into that category. There is a player driven economy, there is trading/gathering/social interactions. It absolutely falls into that realm.
---
In a game where they have continuously set the precedent for this.. such as the upcoming "RAID".. yeah, precedents are set.
---
--
---
I don't care if it's instanced. The point here is that it is a poorly crafted piece of content that is less difficult than most other areas such as West Tek. This should have not been compared to a Dungeon by the developers in their Inside the Vault entry. It's a quest, in a new "Hidden Location". 
---
The places you are referring to in Fallout 4. Hidden Locations. Those have never been called Dungeons by developers. This location has been. That's the difference. 
---
Sorry, but precedents will be set when a developer tries to make comparisons in an industry filled with games that have Dungeons, in games similar to this - that follow the the same standard that Dungeons have had for the last 15+ years.
---
Forgive me, Vault Hunter! ;D
---
I didn't get a single legendary enemy the whole time. Not that there was much of a chance for it with the 13 total enemies that spawned.
---
This reassuring, thank you! üòÅ
---
Especially something that literally tracks your life sign vitals! Good idea!
---
Sheep is easy if you are the one to man up and be the conduit for all 3 pylons, seems like know one understands they need to activate the pylons. I always end up being the conduit for all 3 get the whole thing done in few minutes.
---
The Mire is great for that. I know the spot, we got jumped similarly last night, and the only difference is where we made our stand. We made it to the hotel, leaped up to the second floor, and used cover to stay alive while we wasted lead and defended our approaches.
---
I can appreciate what youre saying.
---
However, was there even a time where something about the game WASNT a disappointment?
---
Theres nothing wrong with level locking content. That would alienate such a small percentage as opposed to having more than half of your user base consider giving up and losing even more faith in your company.
---
Quite possible, I haven't ran into issues with cliff top snipers before.
---
I'm assuming you are talking about the computer passcode? It's Ma Ri 11 17 I believe.
---
To be fair it does say well geared can tackle it alone and everyone complaining about it being easy are most likely well geared..... Which is probably true because with crap gear gutsy and ghouls can tear you a new one
---
Everybody's be "that guy" who needed a joke explained to them. It was your turn, apparently.
---
&gt;You got your $60 worth in the base game
---
Lmao
---
That is a good point. I didn't think of that maybe time limit and only access to only one or you would be charged a heavy fee? Or banned from using it?
---
I just did this quest on a new character and had a total of three enemies total in the live fire exercise, one for each wave. I was disappointed because that was one of my favorite bits from leveling up the first time.
---
Especially when you are at your camp, I would love to check my quests when resting!
---
That sucks, but if it is any consolation at all you really didn‚Äôt miss much...at all.
---
I'll just have to Keep Calm and Collect Screws. Oh... damn, and springs too. Those gauss rifles really tore through my supply :)
---
&gt;Fallout 4 had what you are personally dubbing a Dungeon. But they are called Hidden Locations. 
---
Hidden locations are nothing to do with it? Hidden locations are locations on the map that aren't marked.
---
The locations I listed were literally referred to as dungeons by the devs.
---
Yet they will be for the rest of the week, I‚Äôm sure. Maybe even next week! üôÑ
---
&gt; Walking into The Burrows is like entering a Walmart after Black Friday.
---
And less violent as well
---
Amazing advice thank you.
---
The end boss for me was a 3* assaultron dominator, it had a quest marker for me. 
---
Maybe people in servers who've killed it recently get scammed out of killing it?
---
I'm level 90ish and it was sort of a pain because of the invisibility (no vats) but I  quickly found out it's only invisible while you're detected.
---
I'll put it down to a long day haha! Have a good evening :)
---
I don't know if they said instanced or not. I am just stating what I would've liked.
---
Same response from me here, I shut off the game and went to stand in the shower for a while to try and wash away the disappointment.
---
I got in with all enemies spawned once and there were 50-100 ghouls and about 20 gutsys
---
I think your first suggestion is one of the most important changes that needs to be made to this game. Having specific high-level areas pretty much ruins this game, I‚Äôve never seen a nuke dropped anywhere other than Whitesprings.
---
How the hell you got that i have no idea, the entire hut only has a note about the sheepsquatch for me, but thanks! may thy sharts be few and toilets many!
---
I went in solo and didn't even bother finishing it. Ganked all the ghouls, got a 3* lead pipe off 1 legendary, and since all the 68's were just lowball dropping ammo, junk, and chems, I considered myself lucky and bailed. Wasn't even worth the effort.
---
Same here. I found 3 tunnels I can‚Äôt access because the valve is on the other side. Had to leave because of the legendarys I need to sell.
---
Did you restock the shelves after you ate the groceries?
---
Keep licking.
---
did anyone else collect the "mysterious quills"? they are junk that beaks down to bone but it wont autoscrap them so im gonna save them
---
This^ lost count on how many times I laid down in white Springs golf course on them nasty sleeping bags!
---
2* unfortunately, but I'm definitely still fine with that considering the reports i'm getting.
---
I knew there wasn't much to begin with, that's why I took my time to explore it. Now I was robbed of that little bit as well
---
but why were you "looking forward" to something that objectively was never even suggested by the devs to be coming?
---
No, they meant 2 specific level 50 players. Fred and Frank, the two new QA people.
---
I was the conduit for all 3 pylons for the entire event yesterday. I was running around as the x3 conduit, trying to just stay alive, yelling on my mic for everyone else to kill the assaultron.
---
Well guess what, everyone else was worthless as fuck. Not only did I have to be the conduit, I had to do about 70% of the damage to the assaultron as well. God damn those players were worthless pieces of shit. They weren't even attacking the damn thing most of the time, despite the fact that I was doing all the conduit work.
---
I spent about 40 stimpacks during that battle. Oh well.
---
Hmm... I guess I actually did finish it then, I thought I somehow missed a huge portion of it... what a joke
---
Who cares about the engine?  People don't play Fallout games for the graphics.
---
I have a decent level 50 chest piece. That is it...
---
Honestly man. I have a lot of hours in this game. The amount of Jerks that I have come across pails in comparison to the folks that are cool.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong the jerks can really suck, but most people just want to play with or without you. I missed the beta, but since release. I have had my camp attacked once because I didn‚Äôt want to trade with some loser. And I teamed up briefly with a guy who was a jerk to the entire server. Maybe I‚Äôm just lucky, but that‚Äôs pretty good statistics in my opinion.
---
I was expecting to be able to build the egg in my camp.. Where is it? :|
---
All quests in this game are like side quests. The whole game is like a side quest for Fallout 4. Made by drunk raiders too.
---
Problem is it was not advertised as a normal location. It was waaaay beyond that
---
Do you at least get good loot?
---
Either way doesn't make one correct.
---
I feel like the joke flies over my head, but i really don't understand it
---
Where did you find those? The leaked picture of Sheepsquatch has quills on it.
---
Yeah if it was just a small location with a little side quest and lore it would be cool, but the fact that it‚Äôs supposed to be a high level dungeon is just crazy. I just solo‚Äôd it at level 44 and had 0 trouble and was left feeling so disappointed, I‚Äôd been hyped for this dungeon for ages now
---
Not even, west tek is a better challenge imo
---
"MIGHT finish"? Where did they say that? 
---
They promised " a new dungeon experience", "balanced to be a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault Dwellers, but truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone", "challenging foes" , and "plenty of loot and experience for your troubles".  Congrats on being truly brave and well geared. If you got low rewards for an easy run, sounds like you got what was advertised.
---
I try to tell them that prohibition ended in the 30s, but they won't listen!
---
Wast that first Elder Scrolls game by them?  I've played all of those, and Fallout IV.
---
Did not try Fallout I - III (because I didn't like the idea of V.A.T.S. when I read about it).
---
Y'know bug fixing would be nice too, moreso than this uselessness.
---
You can one shot a gutsy with a regular lever* action rifle? I doubt it.
---
Under floor decorations in the same line with the deathclaw statue.
---
In game there are: Dirty Tan Suit, Patched Suit, Patched 3-Piece Suit
---
They've already lost a ton of players with lack of challenge in this game. There were hundreds of posts 4-5 months ago about lack of endgame and content being too easy. My first run of the new mission i didn't even get hit once. My build is a hot mess at the moment, i have no "god tier" weapons and only 1 3star piece of armor. They need to do something to make the game more challenging for the other half before they leave too
---
Not everyone was born in vault 76 though, its only been like 25 years
---
This is the "ham sandwich" hypothesis, which states that a player who knows the game (any game usually), knows the pacing, knows how enemies react / spawn / etc. can likely finish what is deemed hard content using a ham sandwich instead of a proper build. With a decent enough build and gear, it will be trivial - but a player who doesn't have that game experience / meta-knowledge may struggle.
---
I don't think I know this build (I run shotty), got a link on-hand for where I could check it out? Or a website name so I could look it up?
---
Probably the sheepsquatch plushie that was datamined.
---
I was hoping to have to delve into the burrows for a good 30 minutes to an hour, not 5 minutes. I was hoping for a large dungeon, with rewards worth getting, after all, it's supposed to be difficult.
---
Youtube will melt over the faux outrage videos...
---
The tunnels and evironment looked nice and had a great vibe. I will do it solo after the new car smell wears off.
---
It worries me, I love to play this game by myself and worry that the outrage will force them into party locking or over scaling new content.
---
Relatively empty :P but my mom says it's a pretty good representation.
---
I solo'd the 'dungeon' on my level 35 alt. Leveled up twice but still disappointing.
---

---
Nope thats it thanks for your money bye.
---
Ah, so when you see boomer, go to the white round table furthest away from him to the left, the note is pretty hidden (literally camouflages) but it should be on that table. You pick it up and read it, and it'll direct you to a little shack south up on the hills/mountain-ish landscape.
---
This is basically the problem with every open world game, but especially every Bethesda game. It's the same in Skyrim, was only mildly better in Oblivion due to the gates being all over the place.  I don't understand the complaint. "I've explored everything on the map over the past 100 hours and now I'm finished." Well..... yeah. If you wanted an infinite exploration game, play Minecraft.
---
Sheepsquatch wasn't a good difficult it was a poorly designed kind of difficult and now this is just face roll dumb.
---
True I agree with that. Too small to be a true dungeon. The way they described it made me and seemingly most the community believe it would be much larger
---
I really hope you still do - this one doesn't have windows or indoor plumbing üòØ!
---
I liked Fallout 76 a lot, but the fact is that I am playing TD2 now. For me the new content took too long and were quite disappointing.
---
The game deserved more and Beth was not ready for "the online world".
---
It was a fun game, but I can't see myself returning from TD2 to it. Shame.
---
I have not followed Beth actions for a long time, so I don't know the latest news in FO76 world.
---
Huge disappointment. It took about 10 minutes and a couple hours of disbelief that Bethesda spent a good amount of time building the map and only one quest. Not even a quest line. No dailies. No plans. No gear aside from an assaultron blade that you can‚Äôt scrap or craft. I defend Bethesda on a lot but the last three additions were hardly worth the update. The last thing that I was interested in was biv.
---
"The Burrows is balanced to be a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault Dwellers"
---
Balanced how? There's 10+ players on every server atm. 
---
"But truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone"
---
You're never alone. Never
---
"If you manage to emerge victorious, you‚Äôll receive plenty of loot and experience for your troubles"
---
No you wont. Everyone else is killing everything 
---
"The quest can only be completed once, but after it‚Äôs finished you can repeat the dungeon as many times as you‚Äôd like for even more loot and XP."
---
Yeah. You and the other 20 players on the server
---
The only way anything they said would make sense is if it had been instanced.
---
Because when they announced the difficulty and loot amount it sounded like that would be the logical thing to do from a development standpoint.
---
Right? Like who eats a steak, steak standing up? Let alone a deathclaw steak.
---
Radical!
---
I think people assumed cus in the Bethesda Game Days video Todd Howard himself said "These dungeons will be instanced"
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zIQaXj8h6o
---
And didn't they call The Burrows a dungeon...?
---
You painted a very bleak image for me and was exactly what I was fearing. I love new content and areas to explore, but it will be a big letdown to enter an area completely void of anything to do/loot. Maybe I should give it till the weekend (or longer) before venturing into the Burrows. :/
---
&gt;Perfectly crafted
---
There are void holes, a number of z fighting locations, the ending is abrupt as fuck. It's not perfectly crafted. 
---
This argument is also fairly silly, there are hundreds of additional (and usually much larger) dungeons on the nexus for Bethsoft games. 
---
also LOL U DIDNT DO DIS SO U DUN KNOW WUT U TALKIN BOUT argument? seriously?
---
So you have 200+ hours into the game and you're complaining about a lack of content?
---
I kept looking at the birthdays but probably dumb me kept getting the numbers wrong on that. I tried other cats as well since some also can be spelt out with the letters given.
---
Casuals already have entire game for them. It was the time for people that want a challenge to get something. What a let down.
---
RadShield suppresses mutations as of the most recent patch, sadly. :(
---
And to think they said horses are extinct in Fallout. Esquilax here to prove them wrong.
---
It's his favorite cat, I believe, plus her birthday. He talks on the terminal about getting her a key as her birthday present.
---
i posted the exact same thing and was downvoted into oblivion, this board is fucked
---
there's some terminals with holotapes in
---
I would argue that a very  hard high level area wouldnt alienate the lower level plays for a few reasons. First off is that the vast majority of the map is made for low level so theres much more challenging and rewording areas for low level plays. Secondly the lower level people haven't played the game as much so they still have all the orginal content to get through. Lastly adding in very high level area gives lower level people something to work towards. At the current state getting to the end game is something you almost want to avoid because there's simply nothing to do. Level up would be much more satisfying if i knew there was a lot left to do onces i get there
---
You get atleast one more holotape from the last chamber (lets call it chamber since its a DUNGEON) from terminal
---
I know, 20 percent damage on my character is enough to make shot1+shot2 stronger on the BE than shot1+shot2 with the IE. 
---
BUT: I'm not interested in the second shot, I want a hard first shot, but it's only hard if the explosion is derivated from the insti damage, so I really would like to test it myself. Its pretty simple to test:
---
We need 2 guns of the same type. One is IE, one is some useless stuff+E (Mutant slayer or something).
---
Then we hit a ghoul with IE, and take a look at the damage his neighbor got from the explosion. Same for the other explo gun which doesnt any additional damage (like Mutant Slayer). Then we can compare the damage of the ghouls standing next to the ghoul we hit directly.
---
I am inclined to agree with that.
---
I'd guess the only people who even read their weekly posts are the people like myself who know the game and play a ton of it / care a lot about it.
---
So when they say "hey this is tough content guys" we expect it to be tough for "us" and not just tough for the masses who play like they've never seen an FPS before.
---
Head to the Southern Belle Motel, there is a note on a table outside :)
---
idon't know how to do spolier but they were in a body when you go to the campsite for the larry quest
---
Fs in the chat for all the people dying of malnutrition while sitting
---
The only problem with encrypted is starting the event, and the rewards
---
What platform?
---
not me, I play the piano, the banjo, the guitar, the tuba, the drums...
---
Oh yeah forgot 
---
PS4
---
Serendipity is really good, the first perk I pick most of the time. But if you are set on vanguard it will not be worth in pve. "Ironclad" is one of my least favorite card for dr. The other ones you mention are not a must for pve stuff (trapper piece or rad res effect will help against rads). "Evasive" (only need 10 agi to max iirc) and "Barbarian" (20 str for max effect) are probably better options for defense. Especially since you mentioned melee, high agi and str are nice for it. "Life-giver" is nice but not really noticeable with vanguard. Escape artist might be one of the better defense options as well even without sneak. Can't hit what you cannot see.
---
Endurance perks that you might like, "Rejuvenated" is always a nice one if you don't know what to pick. A combination of "solar powered" and "nocturnal fortitude" if you are really set on having more hp, plus a nice str boost. "Life-giver" is nice but expensive and only really low hp builds benefit from it in my opinion. You can always go for one of the radiation resit type cards but getting 1 or 2 trapper pieces with a legendary rad resist on top of it will do wonders. I have that and run at 20% hp next to the queen, rads aren't really an issue.If you are looking for armor with the legendary rad resist effect, be sure to check the status screen. If it does not display an additional rad number it is bugged/not working.
---
This is the same guy that wanted people to give him caps when he lost all his caps playing survival mode.
---
It was advertised as a high level dungeon that would require atleast 2 level 50+ players to beat. But what we got is a 10 minute quest that a level 40 can solo
---
I'm waiting for my minimum of 3 days, so 9, Mr. Fuzzy Tokens from the brewing patch that temporarily disabled the all other daily quests. I'm starting to think it's not going to happen!
---
Most welcome :)
---
They said the **vault raids** were going to be instanced. They also said they were building the instancing technology for them.
---
They never said this was going to be instanced.
---
Nah
---
Nope. All the mobs where dead when I got there
---
I want to ask all the players that are complaining of this being too easy...
---
What level, what build, what weapon?
---
Do you not get hungry or thirsty while playing an instrument?
---
I think it's disappointing too judging from how easy it sounds. They did say it was going to be challenging and it appears that isn't the case.
---
But they **never** said it was instanced. Ever.
---
I haven‚Äôt played it yet but I want to check it out!
---
We're not talking about them. We've established they didn't perfectly craft it. You said that a single person can throw this together in a weekend.  So prove it.
---
too good for throughly used mouth harp playing in the humid, spore filled Mire?
---
What was advertised was a challenge - there was none
---
What was advertised was loot and xp - there was very little of both (zero legendaries of any star)
---
The problem is that a challenge shouldn't be done in 10 minutes. This isn't what they advertised. I literally waltzed through the dungeon wearing the bad Billy costume using a guitar sword. That's not a challenge. 
---
I've been defending Bethesda since the game launched, but they messed up on this one. "Collect your gear and call your squad together"...why? So we can all walk through and look at the 4 ghouls together?
---
I've been through it 7 times so far, I can confirm there isn't anything hidden. what you see is what you get :'(
---
With the nerf of the spawn rate of legendaries in the open world it seems kinda like a pay for a shot at a legendary mechanism.
---
You're so fat that you are more likely to die of heart failure than most
---
My spec is pretty tweaked, but I forgot to put Bloody Mess back on and ran it with that perk that gives you a chance to double-craft.
---
My weapon was Sole Survivor, the challenge reward from Survival last week, which just required completing 20 events, which you could do by AFKing and being present if you were super-afraid of PvP.  Most of the time, I was the only player at each one, when I did it, and that is, to day, my only playtime in Survival.  I consider that weapon to be pretty darn achievable.
---
My armor's legendary, but also patchwork garbage.  I have one Chameleon piece that I care about.  The rest is there because legendary bonuses are technically better than none, but those Charisma and Rad Resist bonuses aren't helping my build, at all.  I'm trying to get a Weightless set going, and two pieces are single-diamond Weightless, but one is Shrouded Wood, which is practically weightless anyway, so meh.
---
The Burrows are easier than locations like West Tek or Whitesprings-without-a-nuke.  I don't think I ever ran into anything more than 5-6 feral ghouls at a time, except the final fight, which was only tougher because it was bots, but still easier than any given wave at AWOL Armaments, if you solo it (to keep spawns to a minimum).
---
No, nerfing is changing something from useful to useless. Making something weaker is not nerfing it
---
Ok, so you **inferred** that it would be instanced. 
---
They never said it was. Nor did they **imply** it was.
---
You still down to run it today?
---
You wanna run it?
---
Do we get some atoms In exchange since daily will be missing up to 50 put them in two weeks and it‚Äôs a free skin kinda messed up if there‚Äôs no sort of compensation at least for daily hunters
---
I think walking around above harpers ferry is more of a dungeon. üòÇüòÇ
---
Na we need some good team content ya maybe you dont like play with others but its part of the game and there should be content for it
---
Someone most likly killed them.
---
Don't need TSE. Used Executing handmade and no jumping. Didn't even need PA or good DR.
---
gaem bad guys! Me smart :) I just owned everyone
---
surely they will follow up on this question
---
Go back to main page sort by Hot topics theres a thread about it, I dont remember offhand (havent had time to do them)
---
God forbid they just leave Fallout the way it was and let us hunt legendaries without stupid events.
---
Happy real LV52 in few days! üéÇ
---
It's the gateway drug for me. My first gatling was exactly that. I've since made it a prime but rarely use it now. It will one-hit a ton of things during SBQ fights. Now I've got several other gatling guns. Gotta catch em all!
---
No next week. I assume they set the servers and couldnt change them in time since these delays happen so last minute.
---
Try the Morgantown trainyard or the farms nw and sw of Vault 76.
---
I thought it would be nice
---
Your build is probably well suited to your play style. I'm about to find out if I can hack it with mine.
---
yeah, this is some pretty hollow content, i finished it and thought that was the first section of many, I thought we'd face a hard boss and we'd need to go away and work on a strategy to defeat it but nope, not even a challenge. And to add to it that other players can be in there killing the spawns before you even get near them, that's just rubbish. " you‚Äôll receive plenty of loot and experience" is what they say on their website, I got plenty of junk, that's kind of handy, and the reward item which I doubt i'll ever use, as for XP, meh, only Bethesda seem to care so much about us levelling up and i'm not sure why. Big rip on this content, the location is cool but that's all it is. 15 minute content.
---
I got in, but I never picked up a quest, thus I was never able to finish and find the exit?
---
"herpes fery" this had to be a auto correct accident but i am goddamn crying over here lololol.
---
Lol man its not even instanced i went in there thinking i was gonna atleast waste 1000 rounds.
---
I'll farm it for a few days, and see if I get anything worth it.
---
You only need 200 rounds and a stimpack, no biggie
---
You were probably on the same server all 8 hops
---
[Here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bdwn6f/two_new_quests_with_the_burrows_update_mounted/)
---
like with popular movies, I give these new quests a pass until the novelty dies down for this exact reason.
---
Some prematurely busted a phat i hate bethesda load
---
Engine =/= Graphics
---
It can, but it's much bigger than that. It comes down to stability, ability to add content without issues, framerate, latency, and a lot more.
---
The engine is ass, but I definitely agree that there's plenty of things they could do with this engine to help QoL.
---
As far as I've seen it is NOT instanced. Not even a "boss".
---
ü§£ https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacker/comments/aem3yl/my_new_wip_thoughts_criticisms/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app lol u got banned
---
Just go in with zero expectations. Or imagine a misc quest like "investigate the sewers". It's about as exciting as that. Except you may not find enemies in there at all.
---
Good man.
---
x2
---
It's part of the Modern Cloth Chairs set.
---
I returned there and didn't find anything. If the note was the "C.H. Monthly, January" I've already grabbed that and completed both of the remaining sheepsquatch quests that became available today. All it unlocked was the mounted wendigo
---
Sure, but I at least expected a boss. It was just a regular assaultron... I one shot it before it came out of the thing and the quest was over before i even saw the objective. There is also 0 reason to ever go back in there after the 5 minutes i spent looking around.
---
Sacreficial blade mod adds a star. Same thing for scorched receiver mod.
---
But for it to be nerfed, it would have to be weak or ineffective. TSE is neither weak not ineffective. People think Nerf mean making something weaker, but it's not. Nerfing mean made useless. 
---
Example of nerfing: replacing someone's Desert Eagle with the Nerf Maverick. 
---
Example of not nerfing: replacing someone's Desert Eagle with a Glock
---
So you're saying there's a chance?
---
I want to like the game. I do.  And since beta, I've played consistently and managed to find fun here and there, especially when playing with others. I really do want to see the game continue to thrive long into the future. 
---
But lately the game feels to me like a dying MMO.  I look around the map, and there's fewer and fewer people below level 50, an indication that the game isn't getting many new players.  Many of the people I used to play with haven't been logging on.
---
Me and a friend ran the Waste Management quest today and I was stunned to see that we seemed to be the only two players in the sewer. Don't get me wrong,  there's still plenty of people playing, but I'm sensing that interest is beginning to wane.  Hope I'm  wrong.
---
I couldn't believe it when I finished exploring the entire thing and completed the quest in a few minutes. After this hype about "bringing friends", and I was one shotting every single thing in there, with no end boss. 
---
Bethesda, seriously? Please design content for ALL skill levels in PVE.
---
Dude... this one is not on the list, there is a SEVENTH!
---
Gotta find Unsolved 6, a friend in need!
---
Base damage with 1 strange and no perk cards: 73
---
U mean the cooldown? Ok I understand, but I can‚Äôt see that someone Doin that quest! Even that good quest nobody do that
---
At least there's Vaults to look forward to
---
Many of the BoS camps/bases have max level power than can be any of the T-series, but it usually has to be in the cranberry bog
---
Not even I barely spent 200 rounds wiping out the place before anyone else got a chance to get in
---
I would rate it a solid 7 out of 10 for the first run.  The issues I had with it mostly revolve around it not being instanced.  
---
I get the feeling there is a lot more lore in there that I didn't get because other players got it first.  It felt like it would be a kind of scary, ghouls popping out everywhere, danger around every corner but because there could be up to 24 people in there that element of danger was just gone.  
---
I think that once they instance it the Burrows would be a solid 8 or 9 out of 10.  It needs to be longer and a touch more dangerous to be a 10 out of 10.
---
True I forgot about that
---
You can also add the scorch killer mod to guns to make em 4 star
---
I should t have read this stuff on my lunch break. Now im disappointed and i havent even tried it yet. Lol. 
---
What level are the enemies inside? Are they levelled to our level? I was expecting high level enemies, like the very rare level 97 death claw you run into in the wild. But that does not sound like the case here.
---
*suckle suckle*
---
There is a diver suit?
---
Because how much it cost, how big chance to fail is and cooldown.
---
They all got re-routed to the burrows. The dead ones are all that's left
---
The first official Trailer looked like a Sinpleplayer Experience as they always did with Fallout,  but then they dropped the Live Action Trailer and immediatly knew what this game is gonna be.
---
Ok then, let‚Äôs keep our max caps for some reason
---
They show one in The Burrows promo image in news
---
Mire
---
&gt;But you're talking shit anyway as if you know
---
Bruh.
---
Yeah Wild Appalachia's been a lot more about PvP what with survival. But we can hope Nuclear Winter will be PvE
---
The jet will make you jittery...
---
That's shitty. I love when I see someones work. I don't think I could ever destroy it.
---
To bad I didn't get anything like this. The only group experience I seam to get are LVL 75+ packs of 5 or more that shoot first without warning when I'm at least 50 lvls lower. I have no chance to defend or for revenge. 5 or 10 to one? As if. And they call me coward for running.
---
You mean BOS sentinel? As in T60 power armor?
---
RPG MMOs are hard and expensive. 
---
Not only do you need art, but you need a good story and well thought out world.
---
I do not like subscriptions. That puts the company in control of my expenditures.
---
I prefer the MTX so that if I am enjoying the game I can kick back some $ to ensure it continues when I choose to.
---
I know RPGs are expensive to make that's why I thought the 76 buy in and occasional MTX would work to finance content.
---
Subscriptions tho bring a regularity to the cash flow as seen from a developer. It is easier to budget etc. when $ are known ahead of time.
---
Ok then how about a pistol and a melee hmm I could definitely slice you then shoot you
---
Jesus Christ man, chill. It's a dungeon, an admittedly easy dungeon, but there's no reason to go full sicko mode over it. Just move on
---
They literally call them dungeons. They actually added the end-dungeon chests from Skyrim to Fallout 4 for this very reason. What the fuck is an industry standard dungeon? WoW‚Äôs dungeons are instanced so it‚Äôs only fair that fallout 76 (completely unrelated I mean honestly) has to have instanced dungeons... what ?
---
I would really love to complete this dungeon but I feel the floor loot and how everything is displayed is part of it.... So far I haven't found an instance that wasn't picked clean by some other looter. 
---
It's really frustrating when your a rp player. I've loaded into 10 different games now and in each one there's already some one inside. 
---
I guess I'm still waiting for those private servers they promised us..
---
so your advice to make FO76's endgame relevant is to underpower yourself?
---
bethesda put all the perks and armor and wepaons into the game, and you are saying people smart enough to use the resources given us are doing it wrong?
---
yeah, this is silly and pointless
---
Wouldn't it be called a "virus"? /s
---
You'd think they would've waited until they got instancing working before they nerfed the legendary spawn rates.
---
I only mentioned caps because it was relevant to consider when deciding if allowing players to revive each other in Survival could be abused to grief other players. If caps were rewarded when a player was downed then it would absolutely be ripe for abuse. Since caps are only rewarded when the player actually dies this is not the case.
---
After considering that, I was satisfied with the "give up" option we already have when downed as a means to get away from the griefer should they choose to cycle through repeatedly downing/reviving you. Your example of "forcing" a person to wait to bleed out is moot because we are given the option to not wait and skip straight to respawning.
---
And on top of all of that, revives will cost a stimpak (unless they're running Quack Surgeon and using liquor to revive), but either way the hypothetical griefer would also require aid items to continue the cycle.
---
If you can think of any other issues that could come up, by all means, but honestly I'm struggling to think of any real negative consequences to allowing Survival players to revive each other. Other than getting immediately shot in the face by the guy you just revived of course lol
---
That's lame.
---
Wow okay well ty for letting me know!  We did it 3 times and just 1 3 star gutsy.
---
I have non modified ultracite quest reward power armor and a level 35 All Rise and I finished it in 3 minutes.
---
Its maybe on par with whitesprings golf club?
---
I'm specced in heavy weapons and use a legendary gatling gun. halfway through the dungeon, I switched to a tesla rifle because it meant i didn't have to actually aim, and I got through just fine all the same.
---
Assaultron blade with I think vampire
---
thats an irl habit youre forcing on an in-game populace that does not have the concept of cellphones. if thats a feature you desire, over many other things (like welcome mats for camps), so be it, but thats two totally different points youre trying to corrolate. you can argue the pip-boy is *like* a cellphone, but it's also not. i mean, there *are* payphones like, everywhere in their world. and the pip-boy is not something every citizen had. the way the game goes, it seems that only Vault-Tec related personnel got them. but it is admittantly weird we cant use it while sitting, especially seeing how they went through the effort of you being able to move your arm around while you use it. ...maybe they didnt want to animate/add legs from the 1st person view?
---
god it was so awful, all that hype................
---
Time zone your in?
---
Aren't we all?
---
Yes you're right. It's a crazy contrast too the sheep quest
---
Killed myself with explosive rounds
---
I just completed it solo with a broken rifle pretty much lol. Got some assualtron blade for it
---
Not entirely true. The MMOs of 20 years ago had non-instanced dungeons. 
---
Also I agree with your sentiments.
---
Give that person the tools, files and textures available from Bethesda Studios and alot of people could probably do it.
---
He's saying with the resources available to the renowned fallout team, any decent developer would be capable of creating a new hallway based area.. You're trying to say any kid with Minecraft Installed can do it and I don't think that's what was implied
---
Ive started to notice the entire community that supported Fo76 turned into Todd meme generators. 
---
Is this what happens when someone has held onto false hope and lies for so long?
---
I‚Äôm level 45 and it took me less than 15 minutes to locate, enter, begin and complete the Waste Management quest. 
---
Anyone know if there is more content offered? Maybe a crowd of mobs to kill? A legendary creature? Or is this post a good reflection of the current state of The Burrows?
---
Uhhhh, didn't I already claim I don't know much, if any, of the lore cause I've only recently started playing the series? So sur me. And doesn't MMO stand for Massive Multiplayer Online, which is what FO76 is? Ok, so I forgot a W. It should be MMOW (Massive Mutiplayer Online World).
---
Thanks for the feedback! Quick response about the company being in control of your expenditures - doesn‚Äôt this also hold them accountable to provide quality enough content to keep you subscribed?
---
Oh my god that's hilarious and likely true lol!
---
That's how I feel, it's a lonely world out there. Not on PS4 by chance are you?
---
or some mounted head thing
---
Oh when will they give us RP players some love? It's hard to explore the wasteland when it's over populated like this.
---
Well put.  And more like 10 minute content.
---
Most kind sir, thank you.
---
Because they are not instanced and someone beat you to it.
---
GMT +10
---
did u find them?
---
Lol no it didn't and GTAVO was in worse shape than 76 to boot... It barely functioned with little to do other than grind low payout missions to save up for ridiculously overpriced items all so they could sell shark cards. Which is hilarious that this sub is full of Bethesda is greedy posts over stupid repair kits when shit like call of duty, gtav online and rdr online exist. But I guess that is a different argument all together lol.
---
&gt; a guy being fucked to death by a sheep Assaultron
---
Nothing says fallout quite like that
---
They have some tech debt to solve before they can get too big on the DLCs.
---
Anybody notice there's challenges for the camera, but no camera?  Unless I just don't know where to find the camera...
---
Real shit I would really like a statement from Bethesda on this.
---
I was actually referring to another game when I talked about the bleeding out thing. I'm pretty sure it was DayZ, but there was some survival game I played a while back in which it took a *ridiculous* amount of time to die. Griefers would shoot you in the leg and then talk shit to you while you crawl around and wait for a long-ass time to bleed out.
---
Could definitely be easily mitigated by a simple dialogue that says "Press F to accept Revive" or something like they do in other games.
---
That's literally exactly what was implied.
---
This idea is amazing to me cause i have no friends help me transfer my bloodpacks to to havr them on my other characters
---
Fair enough, but couldn't they at least make it hard enough to where bringing friends for extra firepower is required just to stay alive?  That's kind of how it was sold.
---
Wait seventh?? I've already lost track with all of them, I know about the 4 that first came, then this one and the misc one, but another one? Where does one fined "A friend in need quest"?
---
So do you think I as a lvl 60 could do it solo? I hear everyone saying it‚Äôs easier than they originally thought.
---
I did. Definitely Sheepsquatch related.
---
Yes definitely! I always want to leave a gift for a player after using their camp
---
That was my feeling to when i realised i completed the mission. 
---
So i added my own mission, how much scrap could i collect. Must say as nobody els bothered with collecting it i found about 200 lead and 350 steel.
---
&gt;Oops, didn't mean that. Oh well no point in fixing it. By the way, new items in the shop.
---
I thought tank killer worked on the laser rifle?
---
Fallout has been my favorite game series for years.  I also happen to live in WV.
---
I was one of the people awaiting the reveal of SOMETHING online.  It was rumored to be a remaster of Fallout 3, but we didn't really know.  When the trailer finally started, it looked like Fallout 3 and had that classic Ink Spots intro so I thought, *"Yep, there it is.  Remaster of Fallout 3."*
---
It suddenly switched to *"Country Roads"* and I screamed so loud I woke up my girlfriend.  NO FUCKING WAY!?!  IT'S IN WV???!!!!??????
---
Nothing is ever set in WV.  To have a major video game set here of any kind would be a surprise, but Fallout?  Pinch me, I was dreaming.  I was SO excited.  It was one of the highlights of my year, honestly.
---
Then I got on Reddit and argued with people who said, *"Just because they used that song, that doesn't mean it's going to be set in WV."*  Idiots.
---
Then when we found out it would be online-only with no single player version, I was bummed.  I do not play online games.  I do not play with other people.  Hated it.  Debated whether or not to buy it, but ultimately decided if it's Fallout and it's WV there was really no way I wasn't going to play it.
---
I'm glad I did.  I have gotten way more than my money's worth out of the game.
---
or we misinterpret, or bethesda is getting used to making the ridiculous
---
Unless they're cannibals, in which case they could very well take your junk....
---
I think the next dungeon is gonna be big. Just based off the trailer for Wild Appalachia. The Arktos one. But this one is disappointing.
---
Probably.
---
This wasn't advertised as an "end game" dungeon, the Vaults are meant to be the difficult raid-type content.
---
If it has to do with potential bugs because of dropping stuff while sitting...just make us unable to drop stuff while sitting.
---
20 is not an exaggeration, I just played part of it (got to the pipe valve) and can absolutely say I fought through 20+ ghouls to get to that one point. 
---
People keep saying others were in before them so that could have been your experience, someone just killed most of them and some re-spawned for you.
---
I do the same. haven‚Äôt done sheepsquatch yet.
---
*Hands you a shitty nylon bag*
---
Same thing happened to guy behind me by a couple minutes. In the final room he msg'd me asking where all the enimies were, i replied with i killed them all. What a great first experience for that guy, and you, hops into new content only to find everything dead
---
Thanks I needed that.
---
Love it, and good luck finding a medics, the one I use is a hunting rifle decked with vats perks
---
Of course you hate it, this wouldn't be r/fo76 if people actually liked something about the game.
---
I haven't played it yet, I don't mind about the difficulty level of it, but making it not instanced, of course it'd be lousy with people on the first hours of it release so there'd be no challenge to it at all.
---
Lol I think the  dungeon in the preview was vault 96 lol I like the metro 76 town though. Could be cool for role players or trading meets! I thinkbima head into survival and get some burrows PvP action going lol
---
Yeah, looks like the rest of us are going to have to either spend an hour server hopping to be able to play it, or are just going to have to wait a few weeks until the hype is over. I've already wasted a half hour trying different servers and I always walk in to the sounds of some other player shooting things and actually getting to play the game
---
Why do people keep calling it pre-nuke zone? 
---
Every nuke zone I come to is the same level 62 ghouls, similar to the burrows.
---
Thanks :D
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs for arktos
---
Headshots with full automatic. You can even use pipe guns.
---
&gt; Much like everyone else, I was hyped, but I was expecting something like the Glassed Caverns. 
---
Yes, I expected it to be Glassed caverns on steroids.  Instead, we got a re-skin  of the underground bunker at Mamma Dolce's.
---
If they had advertised this is a bunch of new rooms to take a stroll through, instead of a challenging group dungeon, I might have enjoyed it.
---
I have a feeling nobody at Bethesda have ever played an MMO before, though they claim to have veterans on the team. Just to be sure, I'll go look up "dungeon" in the dictionary, I guess.
---
perhaps. I have noticed a few plan spawns that seem to be &gt; 24 hour replenish for me.  Either that or I'm just EXTREMELY unlucky and dozens of servers have had that location plundered.  I've started tracking in a memo pad exactly the date and time I pick up a plan from a particular location, so that I can see if over time my theory pans out. Anyway rambling aside, if you're on xb1 I for sure have duplicates of these plans for sale (cheap)
---
They seem to be really spotty on spawning, and I don't *think* they're instanced so if somebody else hit the plan on that server it won't be there.
---
I still randomly check the train car West of Watoga and I did finally find the helmet/mask. I know I found a torso plan at Harper's. But I'd say like 90% of the time I check there are no plans to be found at all.
---
You realize you could just take 5 seconds before you go to bed to log in, collect the free item, and then log out? You don't even have to join a server.   
---
Would you like them to spoon feed it to you too?
---
Good question and I have not seen anything about it.  I've only gotten as high as the knight captain paint.
---
I love love love your ideas......bethesda please respond
---
Technically it is a different studio. But yeah, I expect better than this from Bethesda. At the absolute minimum they should been honest about what this was. This totally was not a dungeon and calling it that just shows how out of touch with online rpgs the devs are.
---
Good thing we aren't paying for any of it...
---

---
Hey look it's the same issue with the burrows event. Still waiting on those private servers....
---
It would fit more with the burrows
---
Yeah I don't mind burrows being easier after watching countless powerarmors
---
ragdolling after they died to Sheepsqatch and his army of murderbots.
---
It's cool that we get endgame content added because we need more, but not everything has to be endgame and the legendary rewards I got were not bad. I'm not gonna replay it as much as Sheepsqatch and SBQ though that's for sure.
---
The 2 level 50+ players sounds stupid to me but to be fair the random player I teamed up with almost died several times and I don't really remember my build and weapons when I first reached level 50.
---
When was there a fez hat? Ahhh I missed it!
---
I completely agree which is why I thought twice but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs an oversight by a team over oversighters.
---
Lol i had 30 stims and 30 pounds of chems! I did however waste all that plus 1000 rounds on a failed sheepsquatch event after the burrows lol
---
I don't think it's easy......hell my 3* Fatman can't even kill a cricket.
---
I think we need more legendary drops because they nerfed the shit out of every weapon in the game except for Deathclaw gauntlet and Handmade, for the sake of 'balance' 
---
I think the probability of finding a 3* should be the same as it was in Fallout 4 (even more so thanks to all of the Nerfs) and not hidden behind crappy events that either don't spawn enemies or charge you 2,000 caps
---
nope...just got The Gutter as a quest reward
---
Man, they are very.. off point with dailies.
---
I feel like this game is really hard on the processer, I use to get low frame rate with an amd 9590 but recently upgraded to a high end i7 and never have problems.
---
I'm glad the encryptid event is decently difficult. The fact that it has a mechanic to the boss fight makes it more fun anyway.
---
It drops good outfits too. Which makes it worth more to farm for me.
---
Hopefully they see people talking about how easy their new dungeon is and make it harder in a patch.
---
It seems like the veterans they have are entirely on the technical side, with very little experience on the developer end. Would explain a lot
---
Cause post nuke is glowing bloated ones. as opposed to charred ghouls.
---
Isn‚Äôt there an app for the Apple Watch or the Samsung watch thing ?
---
Well after the 5 minutes it will take you to solo this, you'll probably come back to Reddit to rage
---
yea thats why i kept it
---
watoga vertibird (ground) is more often a t45 selection of pieces.  I've also found many t45 in the rail yard north of whitesprings and up (east) the tracks from lewisburg train. (near the cars on your right).  These are the only ones in my mind that stand out as being t45 more often than others.
---
Try going in to the data tab in the pip boy and look under quests. Highlight the quest you are wanting and there should be an option to ‚Äúshow on map‚Äù
---
you understand there is a inbetween here right? farm the area for a few days? people cleared it in 5 minutes how is this remotely considered a dungeon?
---
Heh, yeah I can see that. It would turn heads in a lot of places up here in Michigan as well. ^.^
---
Ah ok, I saw another thread where they mentioned the forest. Haven't had the time to play it yet.
---
A large percentage of the current playerbase are solo players.  You can disagree with that until your face turns blue, I will not believe otherwise.  Rarely do I log in and see more than one dot at 1 place at 1 time on the map. If they want people who normally solo to actually team up then they're going to have to develop a lfg or match up type system in game. Either that or some kind of chat tab because I also see the majority of people don't use mics ingame. 
---
 I don't use out of game services like looking for group or trade. If it's not in game I will not use it.
---
I have done it a few times on ps4. You will get an announcement of the event when it happens.
---
You just described my experience to a "T".  I don't get it, how can that be "hyped"?  Maybe we're just missing something that no one has found yet.  As a solo player,  I was expecting this to be difficult.
---
Are you sure that minigun benefits from the explosive perk?
---
Which*
---
Not at all stable. Usual suspects cause the most issue (mainly Whitesprings &amp; Grafton). 
---
Did see a post mentioning they way went above &amp; beyond as far as the high and ultra settings go. It was recommended to default everything to Medium, reduce the shadow draw distance and leave everything else alone. It did seem to give me a 10-20 FPS boost on average just running around.  
---
Still getting the stutters as things load in however. 
---
6700k 32GB RAM 2x ASUS Strix OC 1070 SSD install btw
---
I'm not complaining about it, but I'll still answer. I found it pretty easy: Lvl 74, sneak/sniper, non-legendary lvl 45 lever action rifle.
---
I've not played it yet but so I am reserving my feelings.  However for the hype about the difficulty I would hope that the dungeon would have scaled.
---
As a female, I take offense. Burrows is a joke.
---
Defensive walls are as close as we can get and they are really touchy to build with
---
This is Fallout. It has always been single player. There are a lot of single players playing FO76 right now. It would be really shitty of Bethesda to do content that is only accessible if you're in a group.
---
So many on this sub can't handle any criticism of the game. Like it's a direct attack on them if someone wants to express their opinion
---
let me know if you figure out how to reliably spawn queen of the hunt each day. I server hop and it just doesn't show back up for some reason. Even when I load in the mire.
---
I think hes talking about the real one
---
When it comes to *Fallout 76* I‚Äôm pretty sure the sit feature is mostly there for photo mode. That being said, that even further justifies giving people the ability to use their pipboy and even other objects while sitting.
---
The demolition perk? Yeah it‚Äôs damage goes up when i equip the lvl 1 demolition perk. I believe he Explosive stat on the gun changes the bullet from
---
Ballistic to explosive so it no longer can ‚Äúpenetrate‚Äù since it explodes....
---
Ohh, I can't wait!
---
&gt; Those have never been called Dungeons by developers.
---
If you've watched any documentaries on Bethesda, you'd know that as far back as Oblivion (possibly further) they refer to interior locations that contain enemies, loot and lore, as "dungeons".
---
Is that it? I thought they were complaining about the levels?
---
Agreed, but we take what we can get.  It's hard living in the dry old savage divide
---
So hyped for underwater ghouls now
---
What I'm even more disapointed about is that there was practically no lore, or it was all just spread about 3-4 holotapes, and the hell cause BoS members to "Disappear"?? There was no real threat, and unless they were picking up energy readings of a pump, there was nothing "weird" about the place, just seemed like a settlement that got overthrown, fell, and just ghoulified.  
---
(Plus also kinda upset that I couldn't find any means or ways to get the Diver suit shown in last weeks Inside the vault)
---
Can't do that with a low-health/high rad melee build. Died several times but I've had fun. Enjoy!
---
well FO4 was a lot more succesful than FO76 so they might add it sooner to boost player count
---
Nah, the "OMG, BETHESDA IS THE BEST DON'T SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT IT" bullshit's to high over here, let alone in that curated cesspit of neurotic fanboys.
---
There are going to be more underground areas one of them is themed around Archos Pharma
---
Well vaults are instance, that is at least positive...But if vaults are going to be same lackluster on boss fighting mechanics, then it being instance, wont save it.
---
I have advice about the armor, not so much for the actual build... 
---
I ran Vanguard for awhile, but made the change to Bolstering and haven't looked back. I don't even run a bloodied build, just having the extra back-end DR tends to go a bit further when you are distracted. 
---
It is also far easier to manage your DR and health as the battle goes on, where as with Vanguard you have to constantly use stims to get the most out of it, and once your HP drops low enough it won't take much to kill you. Throw in some rads for good measure and then all of a sudden you are looking for cover to pop a radaway and stim your way back to full DR. 
---
With Bolstering you can tank longer at the tail end of the battle before needing a stimpack, and most of the time the fight is over and healing factor kicks in so you don't need one at all. Radiation is also your friend in this case as well as it keeps your DR high if you do need a stim by not over healing you. 
---
I've found that with Vanguard you spend a lot of time managing your situation before and during battle. With Bolstering I do most of my healing when the fight is over.
---
Damn! Any chance on finding vault tec builds? There is VTU after all.
---
pretty sure that at least 5 times it wasnt the case, since I saw different players.
---
So after finishing it solo, first guy to run it on my server, everyone was busy doing the encrypted event to notice the burrows.
---
Finished it, died once using a lvl 90 char with leather armour and ‚ÄòThe Sole Survivor‚Äô. 
---
So no intentions of going to Harper‚Äôs ferry, no extra lore, quest prompts just go to the manholes cause you read it online.
---
Entered the sewer, found dead BOS dude and same with other entrance... not really a squad and they died at the entrance, BOS? Aren‚Äôt they military trained?
---
Fought many charred ghouls and got bits a pieces of lore which did not fill in anything except there was a take over and people moved to moss town.
---
About 3 legendary ghouls spawned for me. 1x 3* and 2x 1*. Get to the robotics room to find quite a empty room with nothing of interest (a few terminals about how automation took over, again) and a few gutsy and our ‚Äòboss‚Äô. Completed quest and was expecting more...
---
Final review: Just felt like another location just with a slight more spawn rate... would of hated to do this with other players as it would feel more empty than it does now, I think too much time was spent on the visual of the sewer section than anything else, everything felt like a after thought.
---
AMEN PRAISE ATOM. Maybe its because this is my first mmorpg, but the hategasms seem incredibly premature. For those of us that have a couple hours to play every other day or so, this is gonna be a fun new thing. Maybe its good to let all the game addicts fizzle out before i get a chance to try it. I wont have a chance till this weekend, and user - "ive only run it 5 times so far (on release day)" is a very different type of gamer.
---
Personally I would prefer the subscription model. You at least had cancel as the ultimate feedback option
---
Very disappointed in this "dungeon". Took me about \~5 minutes to clear it. It's just a bunch of Charred Ghouls (nothing else). Whitesprings is still better to farm.
---
Yeah it's like westek or white springs just with a cool new dungeon! A new place to farm legendarys!
---
Oh no, i wanted to experience the dissapointment firsthand!
---
I got 2 Legendaries in 20 ish min solo, ill take it.
---
oh...
---
I was soloing Silos a week after release with nothing special.  .50 with it raining lead made clearing out silos much easier.
---
Exactly the type of shit that made me quit eso
---
The people complaining are probably the guys who only play this game for the sweet dopamine they get when finding a stupid virtual legendary weapon. They don't play it for the story like we do.
---
I thought the new camera got delayed for a later patch.
---
Bethesda, you owe this guy an answer. He spent absolutely no money on this content and he‚Äôs entitled to whatever he wants.
---
While I found it just as easy as any other place with charred ghouls, I understand that Bethesda wants to cater to the new/casual players, but there NEEDS to be some place with challenging and difficult enemies/mechanics with decent rewards and it NEEDS to be instanced otherwise whatever difficulty they have planned for it won't work if you can just zerg it down.
---
New/casual players already have the entire map filled with easy content/enemies, so I really hope that the Vault Raids or the Nuclear Winter mode have some difficult content/enemies.
---
I feel for you brother, I usually become all 3 then get on the building roof and mini nuke the bitch into the ground along with the adds so I feel ya, try cola nut rank 2 I can get it done with about 4-6 quantums.
---
is anything in this game instanced? I honestly dont understand the design behind not doing instances. To me it sounds borderline retarded.
---
Only from the atom store
---
Me and 90% of the playerbase. Dungeons = instanced zones in all other games out there.
---
Thanks for that information. Very helpful.
---
No thank you, got anything else?
---
I did a test, where I get around 57 fps on everything ultra, and still got the same fps with every on low...
---
No wonder this wasn't advertised in the original road map. Was excited to see something that wasn't listed. Would not have been disappointed by the content if it were here for release but to hype it is bad
---
Do you need a hug?
---
Perhaps they were doing a test run on how to add things?
---
I got 7 legendaries when i was lvl 14 by running around like a moron tagging glowing ones in a nuke zone. Doesnt mean its good content.
---
Because Todd gave us that glow in the dark map in the Atomic shop, I was willing to cut Bethesda a great deal of slack. for a very long time.  But even I can't look past this. Yeah. This was underwhelming.
---
I want to know too, when I played I had to switch to my blade of bastet for the 2 hit kill. Using my level 51 character it was like playing thought a nuked white springs without the glowing bloated the only way I was going to survive was use my PA to heal, if not for that I would have died after the 3 horde of ghouls showed up.
---
When was the last time you checked? My understanding is that they removed the effect from the perk and it now just adds a flat +25%
---
I have explosive effect weapons that do not increase with the demolition expert perk at level 5
---
I mean, with that armor and stance you probably intimidated it to death.
---
Also, being able to swivel the camera around would be *great*.
---
GOT EM
---
Whitesprings isn't as good for leveling as it was.
---
It's a good pitstop, but not where you should camp out.
---
I mean , there is more than 2 holotapes but I guess feel free to leave a negative comment when you clearly no nothing about it ;)
---
Will dropping a nuke on the location have any affect on the mobs?
---
It's free, it entices to you log into the game.
---
Happened to me at least twice for the sheepsquatch event, had to going through my inventory to check on rewards (outfit, plan).
---
They must have missed uploading something because a lot seems to be missing. It‚Äôs bad enough that there‚Äôs gaps in the prequel storyline that voids out other fallouts from even happening. You don‚Äôt go from no one is alive because of a nuke. Leave a vault to find robots. Set off more random nukes. The brotherhood seems to have disappeared off the face of the world but everyone still exists in the future. Unless they are going to do like they did in fallout 3 and make it all a dream in a vault, things won‚Äôt add up. 
---
But back on topic. Yea, grab a few holotapes and one set of keys. That‚Äôs about it. Only one holotape matters. It‚Äôs a good size. Just not challenging to say the least. As of right now, there‚Äôs no hope for additional content for this. Both the sheepsquach and burrows should have some type of daily. It looks like there should be more content on both but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be added. Like all of the camp head trophies. No one can get them but it‚Äôs in the game.
---
I sat down on the toilet at work, and discovered this thread... üòâ
---
I even read the terminal and don't know what it was about lol I think just keeping the water pump going? Everyone's dead what's the point! Lol sounds like it was the boys scouts gone rouge maybe it was supposed to drop with the backpack quest?
---
They've added another couple of misc quests that relate to it. I think they're building up to the real thing showing up.
---
You know you can criticize without sounding like an outright prick, ya? This is the problem I have with this subreddit. Not that y'all criticize Bethesda, but that you sound like whiny 14 year olds who think everything "sucks" when you do.
---
God, I don't know why I come back here...
---
Loopget's pretty spot on, the implication was that an employee of Bethsoft would be able to put this dungeon out within three days (barring the art asset and the audio work).
---
Troubleshooters my dude, the robots just tickle after you get a full set
---
Well Discord has some Fallout RPs . . .
---
The first ghoul I ran into was a 3 star.
---
It seems to me that the location was already built out but somehow got cut from the game. It‚Äôs just another location like any other with a short misc quest to go with it. 
---
Bethesda waaaaaaaay overhyped this thing, so ridiculous. 
---
Btw it‚Äôs not a bad place, it‚Äôs just that they made it out to be some vast dungeon that would really challenge players and reap great rewards. It‚Äôs just another lootable location for scrap.
---
It honestly wouldn't. I think the active choices taken about how to make and implement this, not to mention their PR on it, has more to do with the fact that we are all massively disappointed now than anything development wise. If they had presented it as what it is, a new area with a bit of added story to brush up on, there would have been way less hype, and even less disappointment.
---
Whatever the core of the issues are, this being introduced as a "dungeon" just makes me have near no hope for the Vault Dungeons, Raids, or whatever they wanna call them. At the very least I hope they figure out how instancing works.
---
Has anyone tried the hunters lodge  in toxic valley yet? Haven't been around to get on yet, but I think there are a ton of mounted heads there so maybe. Also the cat house with the cat heads?
---
What money? Oh the initial game buy-in 5 months ago
---
Doesn't the number of enemies that spawn scale to how many people are doian event?
---
I dont get how its spectacular, I've come to expect some kind of incompetence when it comes to Bethesda. For example.. not instancing anything in the game. Only a true moron would think that's a great idea.
---
Blackbird was a limited sell about a month and a half back?  It's all bleeding together now but I could see them rolling it out again.
---
10mins of play time is more content? This game has literally 0 end game content. And folks wonder why people are griefed and bases smashed.
---
Its cause we have nothing to do...
---
Here is an image:

It is illuminated btw, it is very shitty and barely gives off light, wish I could give a night time pic, but I have to leave my house.
---
Only thing I can think is FPS cap? That or maybe the settings aren't sticking? Any custom.ini changes?
---
My wife (she is from Huntington) and I freaked when we saw the teaser in the same manner. Like we just instantly knew and I am so glad it was true.
---
What other quests?

I want to sit down on my real couch in my living room,hop into fallout 76 and sit down on my couch in my camps house living room and  play pip boy games lmao ‚Äúfallout pip boy inception‚Äù =]
---
Portapotties also make great stands for turrets. üëçüëç
---
There‚Äôs a bunch of side quests you can get related to the Sheepsquatch questline by reading the little notes on the board in Calvin‚Äôs office
---
I had to run after i finished what was the gutter, i got it too
---
It's what we do. Even when we should be pretty ornery 9n the state in how this game is half the time we still always find ways to make new people feel welcome. Especially solo players like me. We want them t ok see the good in 76 not the bad.  No matter how easy it is to see the negatives over the positives.
---
Official comments today said it's not instanced. I think everyone was getting this new content mixed up with the instanced vault raids that are coming later this year.
---
Want to give us the names of the people who said both things?
---
Oh? They're all different people with differing opinions? 
---
Oh no...you wouldn't be generalizing the population's words in an attempt to make your opinion seem more important!
---
... oof.  It's okay for people to not praise the game at all times. Lord knows there are imperfections to this game of ours. So many. The pal you like hanging out with but keep finding yourself watching sometimes and just thinking to yourself "... why"
---
Glowing bloated ones are lvl 68, Charred are 62. So, bloated ones are a bigger threat compared to charred when they come in the same number. But because pre-nuke whitesprings can spawn level 42s in with the 62s, it's nowhere near as threatening as if the entire country club was just filled with the lvl68s.
---
i'm down
---
Sheepsquatch wasn't even that difficult, was kind of glad to see an event that asked for a different approach. Some just rushed it without taking a look at the pylons. Also, it actually made builds/cards other than max DPS or run of the mill farming useful. People were just not used to swapping those out. Probably a lot just blindly shooting the imposter in the face because unaware of weak spots and pylons.
---
It was the same with queen fights for months.
---
Just beating something to a pulp is rarely the answer.
---
All solo boss fights were to easy lol pause game vats head! BAM head explodes you beat the game!
---
You know not every player has the chance to play everyday, hence they play it on-and-off as it were? It takes a matter of seconds to open the Atomic store. 
---
Would *I* like them to spoon feed us these items? No. Just be considerate for players who may not be able to login for a given day of a weekly period.
---
Oooof
---
Big chance to fail? Maybe fail 1 in 10. But I haven't failed the last 30
---
&gt; I think we need more legendary drops because they nerfed the shit out of every weapon in the game except for Deathclaw gauntlet and Handmade, for the sake of 'balance'
---
Why are you making stuff up?
---
&gt; I think the probability of finding a 3* should be the same as it was in Fallout 4 (even more so thanks to all of the Nerfs) and not hidden behind crappy events that either don't spawn enemies or charge you 2,000 caps
---
Fallout 4 never had multi-star legendaries. Only single star.
---
What this game needs is the ability to choose when we enter locations like this from the following options:
---
\- Public/Solo  
---
\- Group  
---
\- Epic
---
Each option progressively harder and make the Group/Epic choices instanced.  A few places like that would give people good high level stuff to do.
---
I am sure people who reach Harper's Ferry for the first time in the future and find this place at lvl 35+ish will consider this place both hard and badass, but for us... nah.
---
I have to work overseas this weekend, so I have no hope to get the goodies.
---
Someone did this to me on PC then as he was eating he got got.
---
Karma can be a bitch.
---
Even scrapped a few for unlocking mods, and it's still not very strong. Haven't tried it with pistol perks since they straightened out energy weapons though.
---
Don't forget to tag community managers u/Valseek
---
Yeah, that's what i think as well, but when me and my friend were doing uranium just to play yesterday, and another dude joined, and we all said that there are not enough enemies and we were just waiting, I understood that there had to be something wrong :D
---
Ok, me and my friends are about to start running, we have 3 cards each.
---
Can I join u?
---
Maybe the name was changed?
---
I‚Äôm going to check right now, I remember my pistols and rifles damage increasing on a seperate character with a level 1 demolition perk, my understanding was when they nerfed explosive, they made it so demolition can only increase the damage by 20% max, but like I said I‚Äôm checking right now so bare with me while I log in (server is currently not responding as I‚Äôm logging in? Lol..)
---
Yes, but I also noticed, as a habitual solo player, that One Night and Uranium Fever both have much fewer numbers in each wave, and the waves seem to be more spread out.
---
My understanding is that none of the armor pen perks apply to energy weapons. This can be confirmed by using the perk that shows enemy armor resistances (forget the name), swapping in/out the applicable armor pen perk card and checking the energy resistance on the enemy.
---
I was expecting an online fallout with base building where groups of people had reason to get together and raid other people's settlements leading to big fire fights and nukes going off all over. I was expecting dropping nukes to be really difficult and make areas of the map substantially different and difficult/rewarding to explore. I was expecting setting up shop in a popular area to sell goods to all the players wandering by.
---
Suffice it to say we didn't really get any of that and with the player and camp limitations we never really will. Really don't even know why people are excited for player vending finally coming when there are only 24 people max per server, good luck actually selling anything. 
---
I had a decent amount of fun with the game and keep hoping the next update is going to be the one that gets me to actually log in and have some fun but just keep getting continually getting disappointed, especially today with the straight out lies about the burrows.
---
The second image is with pistol perks and it's only raised by 3.
---
I had a similar experience during the last quest for the BoS. When I went into the cave to activate the last becon the cave was full of level 1 eyebots instead of scorched.
---
In the throne room on the night stand
---
Haven't done it yet, but pre-release images showed a tie-in with Arktos Pharma which is located in the forest so that my have been the source of confusion.
---
We okay today fam?
---
One sends you to investigate a campsite. I'm trying to get the other one I've seen mentioned to come up. They pop up as misc quests but don't seem to have a specific trigger.
---
What's the gutter?
---
Why?
---
You on Xbox? If so what is your gammertage?
---
I'm going back to to investigate lol
---
Never thought a 6 level change would matter. Thanks for explaining it for me.
---
We got no camera thats the point :(
---
Yeah soloed it no problem was hoping for more but nice to have something else to do and got a pretty nice unique weapon from it (the gutter) but the hp regen doesn't seem to work and it's not anywhere near as good as the bloodied ski sword with both of the power attack perks I already have but like I said it's free new content
---
Last weeks inside the vault article , it's on here , search it and read it
---
I have an older i7 3770k and a GTX1080 (not ti), and my framerate varies between 60-120 fps depending on where I am and what I'm looking at (indoor/outdoor, dense vs barren area). I don't usually expect stable frame rates in any game unless the minimum is close to the limit of my monitor. Should I?
---
Do you just gain them over time?
---
No, not giving any "advice"... reading comprehension is low today on this forum.
---
I am saying, if you spend all your time working on making the strongest build possible, then don't be surprised when you overpower everything. That's it. Never said it was wrong... but if your MAIN priority is "I want challenge", then maybe stop trying to make the strongest  build out there. If your main priority is reaching in-game godhood, then stop bitching when you reach it.
---
Silly and pointless is being super proud that you can one shot every other player in the game, but super mad that you can one shot Mobs in the game.  S
---
Lol again more bullshit. Gtavo was not in "worse shape" than 76, thats just your opinion. And regardess of IF it was worse in shape... It still had more things to do and grind for on release... 76 has nothing to grind for.
---
 i have 4* legendary and all my sets of armour , i have just about all the outfits, i have tamed just about every pet , i have a sexy bad ass Camp after mastering camp building .. I don't bother with SBQ as i have everything from her, Sheepsquatch i was done after 5 or 6 times fighting it. 
---
Gtavo i had long term thing to grind for .. 76 doesn't.
---
Ohh and the New Dungeon is a fucking joke of a Dungeon.
---
Late April. The 23rd, if we're to believe their most recent update map.
---
I think it‚Äôs a tease for future alien content.
---
I can confirm its mostly soloable till last room, need some good ol tse cheese to deal with that assaultron and swarm of gutsy
---
holy crap you are only 44, you ARE NOT OLD YET!
---
There wasn't even an update. Thos "content" was added last patch.  It was just under some kind of time lock before it became open to the publoc
---
Im a lvl 160 with a 1star handmade, 1 3star and 4 1star armor pieces and the whole game is too easy. I didnt even get hit on my first try of the new content
---
Last weeks inside the vault article, it's on this Reddit , use search and read it
---
How many runs through did it take to get that?
---
Literally does not solve the over populated problem lol. 
---
Like just now. I managed to find an instance where I was solo. Didn't make it 10 minuted before some jackass shows up with a gattling plasma and starts blowing up the entire instance. 
---
All the while I'm just chilling there sneaking around.  Moving through the mission slowly to enjoy the experience. All that ends when they start blowing everything up in sight.
---
Why would you take offense "Burrows is a joke" is hardly melodrama.
---
The post to which I replied? *Absolutely* is.
---
FPS cap is 72, so shouldn't be that. And I've tried with custom.ini and without :( 
---
Guess it could be CPU? Maybe not so good with AMD
---
So it‚Äôs confirmed to increase damage dealt by the weapon, I just checked for you, mini gun wen from 79 damage to 82, if you play ps4 I can do screen shots and send them as viable proof, I‚Äôll even grab a newspaper so you can see the date lol.
---
totally agree , and what about the armor and Aktros Pharma Outfit shown in promoting pictures?
---
&gt; Glassed caverns
---
THIS. That quest is by far the best God damn thing in this game, and if they could deliver more content like that I would be fucking thrilled. I was so hoping for something that felt like that quest again, but sadly from what I'm hearing it's a 5 min slaughterfest.
---
Would it kill you to scroll the feed and look at the dozen other posts talking about the camera; or hey, even the one where a Community Mod replied?
---
Those quotes are from that article. Thx.
---
The tween girl level...
---
I think the problem is how it was advertised. Ambiance and setting was good, and the story and holotapes I liked too. But it's incredibly short (I think one will be able to complete it in 10 or less minutes without hunting for holotapes and lore), and the climax is underwhelming to say the least. I was expecting some new and mysterious enemy, an ending to leave me thinking about implications, story ramifications or some shit. But it was just a shitty (non legendary) assaultron. Wtf.
---
New quest added the ghoul head, so I'm guessing they're gonna be slowly added, but god the difficulty of that "Dungeon" was just piss easy, sneak, pew, \*ded ghoul\*, repeat. Like yeah Sneak multipliers was are a bit OP, but hell I was expecting to get mobbed and over run. Only challenge was the damned OP Major Gutsys and their Armour penetrating .45 rounds, but that was quickly dealt with.
---
I did love the ambience, music in the background and just the aesthetic look , did give me chills at the start and made me a bit scared. 
---
Only one holotape at the end, and one mid way did give a bit of insight, but nothing on why theyre all ghouls and why BoS died.
---
I have hope for Arktos Pharma only because it showed a Mirelurk Queen, and they can be a bit of a challenge, but hell why couldn't the Burrows been swarming with mirelurks or gulpers or anglers, its a sewer for petes sake! Their best living environments are right there!
---
And yeah the Burrows definitely needs a daily if it wants people to grind it, 'cus I've been in their twice, once when there was a bunch of people, and another when no one was inside, and if they want people to be grinding this, it so does need something to make you want to come back.
---
The sheepsquatch I'm fine with if the encryptid event went off more often, just maybe lower the damned cost of the recall circuit board, its a terrible way to "sink caps" as some say its for.
---
Preach.
---
White spring resort is where you go to get plastic when all other places have been exhausted
---
Im going to add my 2c here rather than make my own post. 'The burrows was supposed to be a challenging dungeon for 2 level 50+ friends. Or for the really well geared you can try but doubtful success' to paraphrase their hype.
---
I repaired my armor and weapons, crafted extra ammo, made sure I was overloaded with stims and rad-away, pulled out my exploding 10mm pistol to deal with an expected rat swarm when entering the sewer so I wouldnt waste my precious durability on my heavy guns... and I finished the whole thing with just the 10mm pistol, no perks for it.
---
Where was the challenge supposed to be at? The few ghouls that we kill all the time at whitesprings? The few robots that were too spread out to pose a threat?
---
&gt;   Anyone else think glass cavern was more of a dungeon than this? 
---
I expected glass cavern on steroids and was thinking it would be more than twice the size. This was more like a re-skin or Mamma Dolce's secret underground bunker :(
---
Yes, there is that valid perspective of "People bitching about free stuff."
---
The is also another valid perspective that we **are** paying for it.  Some with actual money for Atoms, and others with our time, attention, and word of mouth marketing. 
---
I think they are heading in the right direction but has some serious issues with expectation setting.
---
A big no from me
---
Even if it was the best quest ever and a dungeon that had met everyone's wildest dreams everyone would STILL be pissed because the rewards could never meet anyone's expectations.
---
At best right now Bethesda can reward players with gear in one of two ways, with direct quest rewards of unique gear or with random legendary drops.  Bethesda will NEVER be stupid enough to hand out unique quest rewards on par with peoples farmed three star bloodied/explosive or sentinel/whatever gear and legendary drops will always be just as random as ever.
---
I would join too, if you are on PS4 my PSN: Chlebostrom
---
I feel like this was likely something either supposed to lead up to an update, or be part of one. What it feels like is this new interior that's not too relevant and pretty much like any other locations out there in the wasteland. If they had just presented it as "we've added a new area to explore under Harper's Ferry, with a bit of lore. Enjoy this bit of content until the next actual update", things would have been fine. Clearly I wasn't the only one hyped for the prospect of challenging dungeons in this game, nor the only one disappointed with what that seems to mean to them.
---
Yeah kind of confusing to me, the magic that is computers :p 
---
With the 6700k I see something like a max of 80% utilization in heavy areas, for what its worth. I haven't actually OC'd the bugger either.
---
Wow ....
---
They could have done a lot of things.. like not advertise it as a dungeon.
---
They should have said it was a new quest that takes us into the burrows.
---
Happened to me too.  New bug I think.  2 players targeted high value things in my base and I only found out when a friend fast traveled there to get access to my decontamination shower,  which was now gone.  Guess it's back to storing high value targets for the time being.
---
I would suggest not killing the assaultron after you've completed the quest, out of courtesy for those who haven't done it yet.
---
You missed the point -- you don't have to \*play\*. You just have to log in and collect the free item. It literally takes a grand total of 1 minute total of your time. If you can't spare 1 minute a day, then guess what -- maybe you're not meant to complete this challenge! That's OK!  Not everything in every game needs to be catered to the lowest common denominator. There's nothing wrong with missing optional, free, cosmetic-only content, nobody's robbing you.  But if you can't even spend 1 minute of your time for the easiest possible thing to do in this game, why should you be entitled to the rewards?
---
Not instanced..? Buzz kill, so it's gonna be a new whitespring where everyone fights over respawns
---
I went through the country club about an hour ago, had one glowing wendigo, 7 gangrenous ghouls and 9 or so charred? Numbers could be off as I didn't count at the time, but post nuke those would all be level 68 ghouls in a tight area.
---
There's an underground bunker at mama dolces?
---
Try going through the new burrow dungeon with it to make it a challenge...;)
---
That's a bummer. Do you have a laptop, or could you remote desktop in? You wouldn't even need a playable frame rate. Just enough to redeem the freebie.
---
What ? Multiplayer fallout YES   
---
\*Think about getting offline raid and getting killed in 1 shot with snipers   
---
\- I HATE THIS  
---
\-PVP optional  
---
YES  
---
It can be BR  
---
NOOOO  
---
It is not BR  
---
YESSSS  
---
\-Wait what happend When I saw 100 people with me at the same time  
---
NOOO  
---
There will be dozens player in map not hundred not thousand  -GOD HOWARD
---
Pre ordered it
---
It got delayed, they meant to delay those challenges but didn‚Äôt
---
This.
---
Chances are we'll see them both later. I can imagine the Pharma Outfit being part of the next dungeon as a reward (since that does make sense) or... Part of the dreaded Atomic Shop.  
---
As for the new Armor (rumored to be the Diving Outfit from Fallout 4) there's people suggesting it'll be a cosmetic purchase for the Robot armor, but I'd say that it's, again, going to be part of more upcoming content. This whole "Drip Feeding" thing is annoying with this update considering that the level of content being given is so... well bad this first load.
---
its indoors. cant nuke it.
---
I want to sit down next to my radio in the safety of my camp and want to drink a Nuka cola, check my quest objectives or  inventory but the sitting paralysis sets in and all I can do is stare at the poster on the wall.......is there no end to this purgatory, why must I eat and drink standing.
---
I feel a timegate isn‚Äôt the best.  I‚Äôm a big fan of a cap sink style.  Caps are becoming worthless.
---
The Whitespring doesn't respawn anymore and Watoga doesn't spawn any legendaries at all anymore...... I'm not making shit up!!!!
---
Legendaries weren't gimped to death in Fallout 4 either...which meant you didn't need to throw away a 2 shot Fatman because it would kill the fucking SBQ in one shot it was so fucking awesome.
---
This game sucks without 3* legendaries spawning.
---
Thanks so much!
---
English?
---
Realistically I expected as much, but was hoping hard for a Bethesda score, ( I figured they were due), and even managed to hype myself into jumping on first tonight instead of working on my plumbing when I get home.  I am glad I've read all these reviews now so I won't be disappointed and get online and rant about it later.  Thanks for the honest assessment.  Sooo..., plumbing first tonight.
---
I agree, it would be nice if we had more difficult events, or an area of the map where monsters are extra badass.. and also with the fact that people are maximizing their builds by level 50-60.. there should be more incentive to level your character 100-300+ whatever the cap
---
Yeah, inside mamma dolce's  there's  a key card on a desk somewhere.  Outside the place there is a large pipe with a hatch you can open that leads  you to a hidden door where you swipe the key card. That gets you in the bunker.
---
I've found all the marine plans (arms, legs, torso, wetsuit, tactical helmet) dozens of times in Watoga, but it seems that since the last patch the wetsuit and helmet are a lot harder to find.  I'm sitting on multiple copies of everything but the helmet right now if anyone is interested.  I'm on PS4 - rip67
---
let me look when I get home.  Is there anything that you are looking for?
---
Super odd. Also isn't rank one demolition expert +20%?
---
I was wondering what happened to that too. Either this questline is unfinished or they are just baiting us with false images for these DLCs.
---
That's why I'm wondering why the challenges to gain atom points, at least two daily are camera required, and at least three of the weekly!  So, what?  I don't get to have those challenges this week?  Wtf is that?!
---
Do you work at Bethsoft? By what metric do you measure your time estimates as reasonable? Given that task estimation in software development is typically informed by experience....
---
Ha!
---
Do you not understand the difference between unintended bugs and features?  Here's a hint on one key distinction, one of them goes in patch notes and the other doesn't.
---
Adrenal wasn't fucking nerfed, it literally broke and wasn't applying the bonus unless your reapplied it and even then wouldn't always display properly.
---
The problem is we are only hearing the vocal minority: the people that hate either of them. Encryptid is hard and, like the SBQ, there's a chance a failure. Some want a sure thing with a loot pinata at the end. I'm sure there's probably 25% of the player base that would use cheats codes if that was an option. Everyone is different and everyone defines fun differently. Doing Encryptid is fun for me, even when we fail because that's part of it. Know what else is fun? Fertile Soil, the easiest event in the game. Any event that triggers often enough and is fair can be fun. The ones that aren't fun? Messenger, Swarm of Suitors, Patrol Duty, Distinguished Guests, etc. They are either broken, frustrating, or they don't trigger often enough to be able to do them when you have a few minutes to spare. I'm glad the burrows can be done solo as I'm a lone wanderer. I'm looking forward to when I can do a fresh run of it without other people's debris and corpses littering the place. I'm guessing that's the real reason it sucks right now as they are probably loading in after half of the enemies have already been killed and aren't lootable.
---
Exactly!  
---
I was expecting something on par with the silos in terms of length and complexity considering all the damn hype they threw at us. But instead we got a glorified dungeon which is so simple I would say (with ease) half these PvPers with their duped or OP legendaries can do it with a level 30ish toon without breaking a sweat.
---
I found one of the quests in the mire, where‚Äôs the other one located?
---
THE AREA. THE AREA. A Nuke would most definately affect underground areas. Is it not worth a try?
---
PUBG has flown by me in a matter of months, I feel ancient! üòÖüòã
---
Since wow launched back in the early 2000s taught us never to bang in same day as content drops.  Always unforseen BS.  The following day after release normally yields better results.
---
Doesn't matter.  It's a role playing character.  I play in groups all the time and do all end game events.  It's a way to make things fun as compared to doing the same thing everyone else does.  That gets boring to me.
---
Oh damn, really?.  Hear that everyone?  Discussions over then, we can all go home.  Nothing to see here.
---
You said that they need to change 3-star probability to the same as Fallout 4, when Fallout 4 had no 3 stars. 
---
You also said that they "nerfed the shit out of every weapon in the game", which is also false. Feel free to prove me wrong, and show me these "nerfs".
---
I just checked this last night on an explosive laser rifle and it does not affect it for sure.
---
Dude these are the same people that threatened to quit the game over a 400 lb max stash and used carry weight glitches "just to make the game playable". You're talking to the wrong crowd of idiots that have fought to make the game as easy as possible while still crying loudly about it being too easy.
---
how good is the healing when it procs.
---
Found 4 legendary weapons on 4 enemy, but the enemy was not all marked legendary. Got a hunters gatling from what looked like a normal ghoul.(no stars or the word legendary)
---
I‚Äôve heard of you guys losing things from the Atom Store if you change it.
---
Not changed at all, still buggy and shit
---
I punched every Ghoul I found in one hit, the Gutsys in two or three hits. 
---
The Assaultron would be an actual fight- If I've never faced a level 46 one before.
---
I came home with a dozen one star legendaries, all 45-50, but nothing of interest. That made me some caps.
---
I‚Äôd rather have caps for my effort. Besides you can wait for him to put it up first. It‚Äôs easier to make 2k back than it is to get an All Rise. If he doesn‚Äôt put it up then he‚Äôs a scammer.
---
Vampiric Increased Damage Assaultron Blade
---
Yes, it saves
---
Whitespring is over rated, unless you like getting tons of shitty 1 star legendaries. And competing to kill respawns because it's over crowded.
---
Save is server side, I did it and lost nothing
---
Calm down mate
---
I get it, but really at that point streamlined builds don't really matter at all.
---
You're obviously still young enough to think you weren't overly dramatic as a tween girl. All good.
---
I prefer westek. Closest thing to an instanced dungeon
---
You can't. It releases next week. Bethesda fucked up the challenges.
---
Don't think you know what that word means. But hey if you are cool with being blatantly lied too more power too you.
---
Listen to this person right here, exactly!
---
Yes. I've probably dropped well over 5,000 cells over the last month or two
---
yeah, it's definitely a build up. I also believe that those events that people were thinking were bugged ("defend your workshop against the sheepsquatch attack!") aren't actually bugged, just additional teasers.
---
toxic larry's meat and go, scour the area for clues, you will find it
---
Yep. That's why I'm waiting for a couple weeks to give it a run. Or at least until some very late night/early morning. I'm guessing that's why it sucks for some right now. They are getting there after almost everything's dead. If you never got a lengendary/glowing one/wendigo at Whitespring the first couple times you ran it, you'd say it sucked too. But in reality, someone just beat you to it.
---
Yes the game has changed since beta in many ways and you should give the game a shot
---
Sure. PSN Doctor-Horible
---
You do have cards?
---
Nice one I‚Äôll check it out
---
Not in particular, I just want something pretty damn amazing
---
I used to but then this type of stuff seemed to slow down. And I like to give access to my camp to anyone wandering by.  Unfortunately cant do that after a few days ago with some folks targeting my high price tag items.   Oh well, gotta wait until the promised no damage to bases if in pacifist.
---
There's ~5-6 power armor frames amongst the many roofs and locked doors of Watoga. Sometimes they're gone or stripped but they'll have an assortment of T-45, 51 and 60 armor bits. Rinse repeat a few times and you should have a full set in no time.
---
Just one and I wondered all over the place.
---
Well if you nuke whitespring or any other area the indoors arent affected so...
---
It‚Äôs certainly worth trying.  If you nuke site prime and go into the glassed cavern though, it‚Äôs no different.  I expect this is the same.
---
Oh god no, please keep all molerats the hell away from Watoga. Move them to somewhere annoying like whitesprings
---
HEY!!! I AM ON A DIET! So you can't eat cake! It's become pretty obvious since i started this diet that nobody likes cake! Ignore all the upvotes and posts about wanting cake! This affects me so much!!! /s üòò
---
&gt; OR add a separate mode in which ALL mobs in the whole world will be level 50-90, but not lower. And the loot should also be level 45-50.
---
I really hope this is what the nuclear winter mode is.
---
Would you even be shocked that it‚Äôs not even in the game, yet there‚Äôs a challenge for it...
---
You're right, i was being generous. This is an absolute shocker. Repeatable Dungeon? I'm not sure that's the kind of dungeon I was expecting, it's just a new location. And no boss? I honestly would've been happier with another Sheepsquatch, something to kick my ass and make me want to play the game and beat it.   
---
I still think higher level players could've been appeased by providing a maxed out version of Uranium Fever. Buff up the mole miners' level to 50, increase the size of each spawn wave and give us 3 x 3\* bosses and i'm pretty sure we'd get to work playing for max level 3\* items. As it is, if you want max level 3\* gear you're pretty limited in where you can go on the map.

I accepted a rando friend request on survival the other day. He fast traveled to me, I waved, he kicked me from his squad and then began to kill me.
---
And now you have both things, along with encrypted and the queen. This was 2 3star enemies for me at least, thats 2 more chances for a god roll item. if its always 3stars or a high chance (as long as its not cleared) its a good addition to legendary hunting that everyone can do without relying on someone to launch a nuke let alone doing it yourself.

Sure if you will help out with cards as well
---
I don‚Äôt have cards but I can buy one card or maybe two
---
That's what you get for ditching work. *Chuckles*

lol i don't need a mini pet deathclaw i have the full size pet deathclaw
---
Well, the point of this post is creating a specific build.  As I stated, I don't care if does the most damage etc.  I enjoy playing these games for the different ways to play it.  So my original post about thoughts on how to improve it etc. aren't really being addressed by you now is it?  I don't care if there are things in game that negate the need for a healer build.  I don't care about min/maxing as I've already done that with bloodied melee builds and TSE weapons.  Let's try to have fun in different ways in the game so we don't become complacent and be like a vast majority of people in these forums who only have negative things to say.
---
Yeah, usually, but I fail to see how waiting a day is really going to help in this case.
---
No I mean NE of Watoga in the swampy area where fuck all happens.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs because he laser rifle is a legacy it didn‚Äôt work? And yes lvl 1 demo is 20%
---
Yes! I would like to have a sit and a beer and play some Nuka Tapper. Comfortably lol
---
His great great grand daddy then
---
I completely agree. I can only dream of the day I log in and I'm actually LOGGED in and the world is ACTUALLY rendered..I too love this game and am a pre day one player at level 90
---
I'm on console, so no hope for me.
---
And my counter point would be why should the game company move forward to set this precedent that one day only limited time, login-each-day-to-receive-a-reward-or-miss-out are acceptable practices?
---
Consider that players may not be able to play on a given day (worse case being maintenance) due to time itself. These limited-time sales and offers for when they go live and expire are suited moreso to North America than anywhere else, if I am not mistaken. Is it the fault of the player? Or of the company for not communicating when these offers go live and expire? It can possibly be the own player's fault, which leads to frustration to blame the devs for this practice in the first place.  I can spend a minute easily to claim such offers with playing the game on a consistent basis. Just consider the facts of the matter for other players.
---
If you want to get into the game, then do it. Its a Bethesda game so it‚Äôs going to be buggy but if you want to play it then don‚Äôt let that stop you. I love it.
---
Nice wall of text..I needed to take a nap..appreciate it :)
---
PSA:  I just failed the event today - mainly because I was anxious to see if my 2000 cap card would work on the server I hopped to and stupidly did it as soon as everyone was underground in the burrows.  We only had 4 guys trying to kill the squatch - and we were unorganized to say the least.  Advice - don't do this event at a time when you know others won't be helping!
---
Sigh.
---
Talk to you in 5 minutes
---
No Problem!
---
Keep in mind, this is for doing PVE type stuff.
---
Vanguard can actually be useful in PVP.  I'm not sure what the current meta is, but before survival mode was introduced I would contest workshops for PVP, and would get one-shot a lot. I managed to get my hands on a few pieces of Vanguard and all of sudden I'm able to tank more damage from that first hit.
---
What I figure is that whatever your DR is when you get damaged is how the actual damage is calculated, meaning it doesn't matter if you have a greater DR with lower health because it's instant. 
---
So in PVP in order to tank that first shot from another player I want max health in order to have a greater HP pool, and wear Vanguard to ensure I have the highest DR. I survive and counter attack with my one shot weapon and hope his bloodied build sucks.
---
In arc guns and armor do have durability. They also have quality lvls. Within quality lvls, Some pieces are better then others and have more armor/damage.  Presumably stored as a float as they are reprented as xx.x .   additionally skins can be attached to each one.
---
Modding is not as robust as f76 but Some of the weapons do have the ability to add things like scopes. 
---
Its been awhile so i dont know if they've added anthing else. 
---
So while i think youre right, arcs items are simplier to store, they aren't THAT simple. 
---
But yeah.. If they just made the stash able to hold unlimited junk and other simple items, it'd make things so much better. X.x
---
Didn't some datamine and post the picture of the sheepsquatch here on reddit? Or was that a hoax?
---
If you didn‚Äôt like it initially, it‚Äôs still the same game. Lots of balance changes, server stability, some additional quests and items, etc. Fundamentally though, it‚Äôs still the same game. I love it and would definitely say try it, I‚Äôve been hooked since day 2 and have over 680hrs currently. But I understand it‚Äôs not for everyone. Play it and form your own opinion.
---
Leaving this here for later
---
And I take holidays next week to farm this dungeon.... I'm just stupid yeah
---
IRL, yes it would. However this is a game where the changes outside dont affect inside areas. 
---
Nuking whitesprings, the inside of whitesprings is the same as before the nuke. 
---
Nuking fisure prime, inside of glassed caverns is the same as before the nuke.
---
So the mobs on top of the world will be scorched and changed yes, so the area would be changed. However the underground dungeon would not change.
---
Bwahahaha so much this
---
Well most likely in this case you might have saved your sick day to add around a three day weekend? You‚Äôre right in that waking up tomorrow will not make this dungeon more challenging or longer.
---
If I'm the only person to ever take a well timed sick day go ahead and stone me to death in front of the rest of the church.  No regrets.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt be that hard. It‚Äôs just a bullet sponge. I‚Äôve never failed it.
---
Sub system would be great for longevity *if* you get enough of an audience. There is a reason we kept getting MMO's that were sub and then became F2P, because unlike WoW, which has a lot of nostalgia and fandom advantages, some new game (say, Wildstar) has to find and keep their audience from scratch. Between that and the fact that people are now growing used to F2P systems, I suspect the days of subscription MMO launches are over.
---
Tween girl wasnt even a term when I was a child.
---
Tremendous post solider, keep those bombs coming!
---
Are you mathematically challenged?
---
You said it your self.....there are 3x more combinations therefore the spawn rate of legendaries 1-3 should occur  at 300% the rate of a * in Fallout 4.
---
No I said they nerfed the shit out of 90% of the weapons in the game. So now with another 90% reduction in decent weapons to get we need the spawn rate to increase another 90%.
---
Or they could've just left Fallout the way it was and just made a new crappy MMOPVP game
---
Oh man, good luck. You might die...
---
Of boredom.
---
I noticed the same thing even on low level events. I remember being absolutely swarmed at Mama Dolce's but now, I get just a few enemies each wave. And I'm much higher level which makes no sense. I do like that they have increased the spawn cooldown across the map. I can go through Harper's Ferry without all the super mutants respawning every 2 minutes. Maybe that's affecting events too.
---
oh im chill, just looking forward to a game when a cargo drop of fussy gamers flooded the sub this morning.
---
&gt; Also lessens replayability
---
Because getting only 1* drops from 3* mobs makes me want to keep going. These 3 junkie rolling pins are TOTALLY helping replayability.
---
ALMOST AS IF THE ENTIRE SUBREDDIT ISN'T ONE PERSON, WOW
---
Yeah, only killed it 2 times, not messing with the "dungeon" anymore. The only worthwile bit are the ghouls anyway.
---
That made me spill my cuppa tea üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I'm baffled when I see these threads..on ps4..literally the whole server shows up..sometimes she's down in 5 minutes
---
I got one too...tried to cook it and it said please check back next year for updates
---
The other 80 posts that are the same as yours do. Myself, I am let down, but certainly not surprised.
---
I thought about it but decided against it. Now I‚Äôm glad I worked today
---
And with that challenge, give us guaranteed 3 star legendaries and plans. GOOD LOOT.
---
we did so little damage
---
[MA] [RI] [11] [17]

might be an intentional leak... if you know what i mean

Xbox or pc
---
All our CAMPs are underground. Guess you missed the memo.
---
Seems to me we always beat her when there's at least thee guys with heavy weapons, most notably .50 cal.  Heavy gun with one gun army perk maxed has crippling effect, which keeps her stapled to the ground.    And keeping her on the ground is key to beating her.  Cryolator to freeze her helps too.  I'm a heavy weapons build and those are all tools that I use when fighting her successfully, but I'm never the only heavy weapons guy there.
---
I wonder if nuking that location has any effect on it.
---
Enemies in indoor cells of nuked areas change to their nuked version but do not drop flux materials.
---
It's honestly a waste to not show up.
---
dang
---
If you want solo content play a solo game
---
27 of may dude
---
Bloodied , Anti Armor and instigating seem to be what I‚Äôm atm
---
Is this burrows related or from just exploring the place? I know when you do the Tracking Unknowns quest you get a keycard to get into them.
---
No PVP for me, so it sounds like your suggestion is on point for me. I just spent a crapload to get my Vanguard pieces so I‚Äôm not excited about having to turn around and buy armor again (bolstering). I was hoping to pick good perks to help me out. I can sneak past anything, it seems like, so if I can supplement that with a few perks I think I would be happy. However, I can also be on the lookout for bolstering pieces.
---
Because you can still buy Tier II items for caps on the secondary market.  I have bought imperfect items‚Äîsay, unyielding/sentinel but not at max level‚Äîfor caps.
---
I wasn't too unhappy about the bugs really, for me I was disappointed in the camp building options, the limited space in the stash and I couldn't find a lot of options for roleplay. Do you have some advice on those points?
---
And then you did it and it was like storming the beaches of Coney Island lmao
---
judging by how they sell emotes, theyd probably charge for holding your pip boy up, a la the "pip-boy flashlight" emote.
---
Seeing as how it was in common usage in the mid 40s... I find that hard to believe.
---
How much do you think my tse and -90% weight pump shorty will sell for?
---
 xCvntD3str0y3r42069x  here, git gud noob. If you can't keep up, GTFO.
---
I'm mostly kidding. Mostly.
---
I beat it solo on my lunch break with time to spare. Says it all.
---
It totally does change most enemies. There aren't enemies inside whitesprings and scorched don't have a nuked version so you won't see changes in the locations you listed but try going in a nuked Fort Defiance or Vault-Tec University. I think a lot of people overlook this...
---
Right, sorry I should of looked more carefully into the other threads, I'll check those out now
---
Keep seeing little post about it maybe random spawn for a player every 24 hours not sure though crazy if true.
---
That shit was creepy
---
Recon scopes can be put on weapons and you get a marker on your targets. 
---
No zoom tho afaik
---
The Gutsies wrecked me too. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with my armor but I‚Äôm wearing T-60 Lvl 50 and I still died twice.
---
20% of 79 should be way higher than the results you are seeing.
---
Even if it is a legacy item the effect should apply the damage bonus from the perk.
---
Lmao!
---
You‚Äôre technically correct on the first point. They never nuke nerfed everything else, those 2 weapons (and the powerfist) were always just meta, or much more powerful.
---
And I think he means that legendaries enemies spawn at the rate they did in 4, because they were much more plentiful (and farmable) in 4. But, you‚Äôre technically correct again.
---
Don't have duped items. Don't have min-max build. Don't have meta weapons or armors.
---
Lvl 154 and used stealth auto style. You need Perception 3 and Agility 1, then take any full auto weapon and put silencer on it.
---
Build done and you can now own the mobs there.
---
I'm pretty sure that not all the dailys spawn every single day. They seem to rotate for me. When I get near Monongah I will sometimes get the Someone to Talk to quest. Then it will be a day or 2 before I will get it again.
---
Unfriend him and don't play with him.  Problem solved.
---
Don't worry. If you've played it ou'll see that your fears of 10-20 people down there at any given time are quite unfounded. My bet is: most will do this once, complete the "quest" (can it even be called a quest? Felt more like a miscellanous than a side quest), and then never go down there again lol.
---
It isn‚Äôt hard to find out. Mari is the ‚Äúkey to his heart‚Äù mari‚Äôs birthday is 03/11
---
Very possible.
---
The point of the peepers is tracking but they weigh only 1 pound. A great item that is the recon scope minus you having to put on a scope on an already heavy item. Zoom feature is a game changer since you can track enemies that dont load away like environments do.
---
That‚Äôs pretty cringe, bro.
---
See if your friends can block him too.  Reporting also seems appropriate.
---
I bet this being introduced alongside Whitesprings as a vendor hub and player trading wasn't a coincidence. I wouldn't be surprised if Whitesprings gets revamped in the NTDF to be completely passive, taking on the role of a neutral vendor hub. Which would inevitably lead towards the formation of actual factions in-game, as we begin to colonize the wasteland. I have a vision of how far this game could go, and it is slowly but surely working it's way there.
---
This really sounds interesting
---
I like this idea
---
Dude, just comment on one of the other posts complaining about hardness. This isn't worth its own post.
---
You are asking how to improve so something and saying you don't care about min maxing at the same time.
---
Do what you want yo.
---
Tell your other teammates about his behavior and that you don't feel comfortable playing with him. If they'd still rather play with him after that then maybe it's time for new teammates.
---
only when playing the skin flute
---
So what if you nuke it?
---
Looky there, someone thought of something nice to say. ;)
---
Sheep has been pretty great.
---
Maybe even get the gun out like that raider from the Fallout 3: Nuka World teaser trailer.
---
Either way..still offense to make a generalize statement  that degrades women or young girls.
---
With Recon Scope you also zoom in?
---
Give riflegaming a few hours
---
Mine is zoomed in on my stash, where it belongs.
---
I remember reading in one of the updates that we would be able to have a permanent effect on Appalachia. Maybe that's part of it. As we frequent areas of the map, they change them to reflect our behavior. I would love to see them implement things like desire paths across the map where people most frequently travel. Things like that.
---
Never thought I'd miss the days of crafting 50 alcohol in my camp but at least that was logistically possible...
---
You zoom in only one set distance. The Pearly Peepers have 3 levels of zoom. Imagine short scope, mdium scope, and long scope. I feel the medium is a bit further than medium and the short is like barely away from your nose lol
---
I love people like you,i know it is not written well,but you could have noticed that english aint my birth language,but you get the meaning of it,but i hate sometimes when some random smart dude comments like that so i just have one word for you in my language "jebi se" go google translate that,thank you have a nice day
---
Maybe they meant a challenge for 50 lvl 2 players?
---
I think that people are using the mmo definition of dungeon, as opposed to the single player rpg (most Bethesda games) version of dungeon.
---
Mmo dungeons are hard endgame areas, meant for groups of people to tackle with persicion and have fun via challenge.
---
Single player rpg dungeons are any cave, tower, or sewer that is in a separate map than the overworld.
---
Not that there's anything wrong with hoping for the mmo definition, but I think that people are forgetting that this is a single player rpg with multi-player, not a multi player game with single player rpg elements.
---
Record, screenshot, block, and report.
---
im sorry this is happening to you
---
the problem is, even if you unfriend him, and block him in game, if he joins your other friends, then he will still be there
---
so i guess unfortunately you will have to make a choice, is playing with the other 2 people worth also having the annoying guy around?
---
if you need to play with a female to alleviate the stress,y teammate Moonpie007 was just talking a bout how she has no other women she plays with
---
my psn is FritoZ, we are chill and smoke alot so we have a good time whatever we do, even if its just sitting at one of our CAMPS and watching the sunset, you and your husband are welcome to send friend requests if you are on ps4, we are both adults, play causally
---
good luck!
---
I‚Äôm in
---
What really didn't help either is them acting like they didn't need to release a patch or hot fix or something today. Hopefully Thursday.
---
Your fine with a 5 minute quest that has no mechanics or challenge at all? Your opinion is partly why this game sucks
---
Bottom line is it is a joke! Anyone who says different is lying. They talked about it like it was going to be epic and it was the biggest let down yet probably! Sheepsquatch is great! Anyone who complains it‚Äôs too hard is flat out junk tho! It was nice to have a challenge for the first time in 60 levels! I‚Äôll do the event every time it pops up regardless of the rewards! I thought the burrows would be up to par with that. Hopefully they improve it.
---
If you just block him, he will not show up as a dot on your map and you wont show up as a dot on his. I would also imagine that it would block mic chat. This is a very odd situation because of the group of friends as a whole. Nevertheless, I am sure the rest of the group would understand and also remove him as a friend. The only way to 100% solve this would be for everyone in the group just to unfriend him. What a turd.
---
That's a great idea!  I love the thought of a higher-level Uranium Fever.
---
Yea i did play it and you are right
---
Who would win? a mk 2 turret or a level 5 dog.
---
Tine to get a new team honestly
---
We shall see üò™
---
I love the 1 shot mechanic of sheepsquach. I literally pulled agro and  ran around gatling gun and dodging him for 8 minutes with some friends to win. The fear wad real. Only died once.
---
I've found that often, my time is better spent looking for acid rather than lead. My base is built next to a bear cave so every time I log in i get about thirty acid and a bunch of springs from killing them. I capture Hemlock Holes golf course and plant the three acid extractors. I follow the train bridge by harpers ferry and grab another thirty or so acid there, along with some lead scrap from the batteries and such. Then, I don Excavator Power Armor for the bonus it provides to mining, stop by the Lucky Hole mine to grab the 300+ lead ore, then drag it home to smelt it down. Whole process takes about thirty minutes and lands me something like 800 lead with super duper.
---
&gt;Given that task estimation in software development is typically informed by experience....
---
&gt;The point isn't a "Do it or you don't understand" argument.
---
Wowee
---
Yeah I just figured out you have to do the quest to get the key. It was just from exploring though
---
If you go to the campsite just south of it you'll get the quest marker to investigate the campsite
---
not everything has to be super meta to be fun, tbh the game needs more healers, they give a reason to players to group up and bond
---
Yeah, I probably should I have been holding off because my first inclination is always to try and make peace, but if he can't come to his senses then I have to do something.
---
They wrote on the walls? As in, used crafted letter camp items? If so, just letting you know that's only possible for someone on your team to do, not just any random who shows up. Plus if someone is on your team they can open any of your locked doors.
---
They'll probably upgrade to glowing ones, no effect on the robots. You're better off nuking Whitesprings still
---
Or, you could unwad your underwear and see it for what it was. But hey, be offended if it makes your day better.
---
As far as I can tell, the assaultron was the boss, which is... questionable, and that's putting it nicely.  In a nuke silo run you are bombarded with around ten assaultrons throughout the whole course of the mission.
---
sadly i didnt go for a heavy gun build
---
So your suggestion?
---
WITH animations
---
Or u could not be a sexist and treat women with respect. üëç
---
 Nothing can ever compare to og Blackrock Depths or og Karazhan, to be fair.
---
But I too was expecting a bit more.
---
Thank you! I might take you up on that. We also smoke a lot. LOL.
---
I ended up on a server that had been nuked at that spot. Even though the dungeon isn't instanced, it's a separate instance than Harper's Ferry.
---
If what happened is as you say and you have video I will give you every piece of legendary gear I have from all characters. It is impossible I'm afraid. Camps persist across game modes regardless of whether they can be placed on a particular server. You would have had to switch server for this to happen.
---
Sorry but we all make mistakes and swear blind we didn't. Put it down to experience.
---
Who sits on the toilet in clothes though...
---
Gutsies have always penetrated armor. If you have low hitpoints they will do this to you in any gutsy spawn.
---
But doesnt the the damage negation also count towards radiation damage?
---
I know, right?
---
It's fallout... there's no internet.
---
it also seemed like he has already been there because he just zoomed by with the obvious knowledge of the dungeon
---
Kind folks are the best! I tend to just stuff away for free. Weapons, armor, aid, plans, serums, junk.  Always at max caps, have everything I want except a certain armor and sometimes I desperately need the stash space since I have a hoarding problem :(
---
Well, if we draw parallels from another well received online rpg (WoW), the burrows is more of a dungeon, and the Vaults coming later would be more akin to a raid. The server size and stability limits exactly how challenging these can be, however they did say the goal is to steadily increase the size of the servers so that we could have double or more players in the same world.
---
We also sorely need an LFG interface, so we can find people to run certain things with, or farm with, and things like the burrows should be instanced, be able to be reset, and feature multiple difficulties. Hopefully the go back and make it that way, or atleast make it that way when they introduce the Vaults. 
---
It probably wouldn't hurt if they reached out and picked up some of the employees that left Blizzard in droves after Activision bought them out. That would go a long way towards helping them advance this game into the same league as WoW. It definitely has that potential, and is still a great game overall, but there is obviously something happening internally that is holding it back. I can almost feel the lack of coordination on the back end in the content.
---
I hate to go there , but I know what we are missing in this game . We got wolves, we got rats , sounds like an rpg. Where the hell are our giant spiders. Not enough cc effects from enemies in this game , the closest we get is ghouls that run so fast they almost teleport between my face and the barrel of my gun . Rad widows would make that " dungeon " better . And twice the size of wimpy spiders we fight in skyrim. I want them to be bigger than deathclaws , and the little ones the size of radstags .
---
I found the key also and don‚Äôt know what it goes to..?
---
About 15 percent of health.
---
I honestly believe this is the best option if it's to the point that it's not just a bother to your husband but also you then that is harassment and you shouldn't have to just put up with it because your other "friends" like him. Please don't think I mean anything ill towards your husband I just know from personal experience sometimes we get jealous fast. Lol 
---
There are plenty of decent players out in the wasteland that will gladly team up and not be creeps and I hope you the best in finding some good people to play with
---
Yes, lots of it! I was the same way about launch. Didn‚Äôt mind the bugs. I loved building elaborate settlements on 4 and was initially turned off by the whole C.A.M.P. stuff. But the more I mess around with what is possible, the more I love it. And in ways that just weren‚Äôt even possible in fallout 4 due to it being multiplayer.
---
For example, I kept improving on various ideas until I found a camp style I liked. I had made simple cabins, giant (mostly empty) mansions, learned to build round buildings, and later tried out making a store. I don‚Äôt use a mic and I play solo 99% of the time, but I found I had too many duplicate plans with nothin to do. Started giving them away but that was hit or miss. Then I decided to center that store design around selling just plans. Now, a month later, my plans store is still open for business and I‚Äôve got a lot of repeat customers. I source them, they buy them. This way I get to keep doing what I like and I‚Äôm helping others. Without ever thinking I wanted to, I have been roleplaying this shop owner for a while now. 
---
Never thought in a million years I would get joy out of something so dumb, but I can‚Äôt put it down. The stash space was definitely a huge issue too at first, but you learn what you use and don‚Äôt use over time. Don‚Äôt keep high level non-legendary weapons that you can‚Äôt use early on, scrap most items to unlock mods to equip later. Always break down junk items and bulk them to save weight as well. There‚Äôs a bug that‚Äôs been introduced that will scrap bulked items in your inventory when you scrap all, always put bulked items in your stash or sell them right away! 
---
There‚Äôs a million more tips I could give, but I‚Äôd say just get in there and explore. Most people in game are more than willing to help newer folks out
---
Is toxic larry's in the burrows?
---
&gt; And my counter point would be why should the players willfully allow the game company to move forward to set this precedent that one-day only, limited time, login-each-day-to-receive-a-reward-or-miss-out items as acceptable practices?
---
Why are you acting like this was literally invented by Bethesda today? Tons of games have daily login rewards, from big ones like ESO and Lotro all the way down to goddamn Candy Crush and Love Nikki.
---
They re-spawn when you enter the Burrows, though.
---
Depends on platform, but if it's max level then it might be a decent sale.
---
Holy fuck, here we go. 
---
You do you.
---
This makes sense to me. This is more of a single player game with with mmo elements, not the other way around
---
Nuclear fallout takes DECADES to fade away. Only the water stays permanently radioactive

Someone let me know - it was for the room where you go to turn the valve - before you can unlock the Pumping Station with the Terminal. If someone else unlocked the door - you will never know or see it. Meh :/
---
I agree, there needs to be some more Events that don't feel like busy work or waiting around. I'd love some that  were even just "Infestation: Clear out (Location) of Enemy Type)". Where some kind of enemy has infested a location and you have to kill them along with a mini boss legendary version. Quick and easy. Some more generic ones sprinkled around Appalachia to join in on.
---
No, it's northwest of Berkeley Springs, which is northwest of Harper's Ferry.
---
&gt;  that military training and target practice was wasted on you. 1 shot 1 kill, no need to spray lead on that range.

&gt; Did you at least police your brass before you l
---
Sure there is ... The Mr. Gutsys should not suddenly drop dead for no reason. Nor should they be friendly until you get near then suddenly attack you. For that matter, they shouldn't attack you at all. 
---
I might not be a great shot, which is fine, I can own that. But considering how short caps / wpns / ammo is as a low level (and new player), they shouldn't make it such a drain. BTW I've been around to 30% maybe of of the Forest area and don't think I've had this situation anywhere else.
---
Nuka grenades tend to alleviate me having to compete. The blast radius is insane. I'll throw on upstairs and one downstairs at the clubhouse and then let everyone else swarm in and kill them and I still get all my XP and loot.
---
And I'm not saying you NEED ONE to beat. And I'm not saying that there aren't other ways.  I'm just giving you one guys experience.

The queen can glitch in different ways, and I have failed thanks to that. There was one time where she simply flew away and disappeared from the event area.   Sometimes she won't land for some reason.
---
My b it‚Äôs 3 star lvl 45 on Xbox
---
Ahh thank you. Only 34. Havent been to the big yet.
---
I was completely blown away by sheepsquatch. Best enemy I've had to fight so far in my opinion. 
---
So with burrows and the way they talked about it I expected sheepsquatch x 10. 
---
What I  got was slightly harder than a molerat horde lol
---
I don't get why the boss wasn't three stars and whatever the max level is for assaultrons.
---
Even if you can only use it in the holo mode while sitting, it'd still be nice.
---
Make friends with a gay guy and have him treat that guy the way he is treating you.
---
I hope it gets fixed soon since you kind of have to eat and drink in the game all the time
---
Well it doesn't have to be instanced. ESO has plenty that aren't and they're extremely challenging and fun. My issue is how easy this "dungeon" is from what I hear.
---
i was surprised we didn't kill her
---
Ok I believe you, I just noticed it happens to me a bunch.
---
Someone who was not on my team built a power armor station in my base because he/she was a nice person in exchange for a large amount of scrap steal. I don't accept team invites very often because they don't tend to work out well. I am not sure if there is a way around the building in bases or not but when they crafted the letters I was not on any team.
---
Nope not at all. Only rad resistance is applyied towards blocking rad damage. 
---
No matter what anyone tells ya the most meta gun for PvP currently is an instantiating gamma gun with fire rate and vats cost reduction. 
---
With deep dish it does 150 rads a shot with instigating triggered thats 300 a shot and long as your health bar is touching the rad bar your at max health.
---
Your died and full of rads in seconds.
---
I don't consider 1* or 2* the same as a legendary in Fallout 4. When I say 3* I mean the best possible enemies that you can kill in the game to get the best possible weapons.
---
I'm not acting like this is a new idea in games overall. This is however a new idea beginning today for an Easter themed Atomic store free offer. If you're fine with daily login rewards for Fo76 now, you need only say so, yourself. I am mostly fine with it but it is an unfortunate matter for players that do not even launch the game everyday, or if they forget and wanted to. It's their loss and if everyone is okay with this precedent for this game. Then alright then. I put my two cents and that's all.
---
Gotta follow the formatting guidelines for titles my man.
---
[System] H: (item/service) W: (caps/etc)
---
Yep, seriously disappointing "dlc" content. Took all of 15mins to do it. Totally worth the 2 week hype up.
---
This is a good example of how wildly different experience players have. I didn't even get hit once during my first run through. Zero challenge. Im a high level but my gear is crap, except for 1 piece, and i used a 1star handmade
---
Arktos was actually supposed to be the first one, not sure when that got pushed back and the Burrows was out up instead. I know Arktos is going to be a lot more in depth, and I believe, based on what is already present there, will give you things to use in the rest of the world after you complete it.
---
Obviously they rolled out the challenges because the camera was supposed to be in this patch. But if it takes them a little longer to do right, I'd rather have them release it next week or so, like they are talking about. As for the challenges, simply skip those?
---
The irony is lost on you.
---
I was stocking ammo and chems to prepare for thisüòÇ
---
I think that as you level in the game, you should become a larger target for mobs.  My base should become a target for raids by higher and higher level mobs, including legendary enemies.  Behemoth and giant glowing Deathclaws armies should be a regular occureance.
---
That would be fun.  Why do I have to go get the legendaries, why can't they come to me?
---
Check his username.
---
So... next Saturday?
---
I commend your dootiful service
---
I don't expect them to get everything right... but jesus this is bad.  You're absolutely correct about it being negligence... and it happens just WAY too often.  I don't agree with the 1 step forward 2 steps back... I think they are making progress... they are just tripping on their own feet every step.  There's only so many times you can do that in front of someone before they lose hope in you.
---
Yeah neither do I.   And I'd settle for some plans dropping.  It's a location formerly occupied by the BOS, so plans for BOS flag for camp, maybe BOS apparel might be cool.  It doesn't HAVE TO Be three star legendary gear. But oh boy the current drops are underwhelming to say the least.
---
Is the sheepsquatch event done now?
---
Same. Gutsies just do stupid damage in general.
---
PC,  https://discord.gg/cQRPaf3
---
You have to go turn the valve again.
---
27th of May!!!!
---
My game crashed when I got to the pump station, I‚Äôm pretty pissed so I quit for now. However, the place seems decent for meds. The only weapon I got was a two shot Gatling gun.
---
Vertibot
---
Ok. My bad.
---
Instigating Fatman With +50% Limb damage
---
Oh shit right its April.
---
How did they hype it up ?
---
Internal game data has 8 terminals with stuff in them in case you want to make sure you found them all.
---
Can you elaborate?
---
Here we see the CoD tryhards outside of their natural habitat. See the discomfort as the struggle to understand the concept of a "quest".
---
Oh, as in CAMP objects? No idea - this was just a random thing I came across in my travels. Not sure if those balloons are something we as players have access to.
---
Vertibot cheese at Ammo factory. Get a ton of steel and aluminum.
---
Sadly, turning it doesn't spawn the terminal
---
and reload speed
---
Do a naked, fists only run! Challenge yourself
---
Do they, though?  I mean, they are supposed to, but hearing on Discord from the people doing this quest, this hasn't been happening when multiple people are already inside.  If no one else is with you, and you enter, hopefully they will.
---
I agree: great atmosphere, layout, story was meh, and had some enormous potential to be something great. And we got a crappy version of whitespring. Only good thing to come from my run was an unyielding sentinel leg.
---
Dodgey in agility and serendipity in luck
---
Some people in this game are the worst. I had to change my gamertag that I had for years inspired by fallout 4. Was nuka girl five. Every time I logged on I‚Äôd get so many messages and party invites from randoms I guess bc girl was in my gamer tag. Since I changed it the messages and invites have decreased like 90%. I play with my husband side by side on two TVs and it was annoying him to see guys trying to harass me. One guy spammed invite to party so many times it was insane. I agree with the other posters. Tell the other two team mates and if they are so attached to him find a new team. I‚Äôd invite you to join us. We have one open slot. Our third is another married woman so it‚Äôs nice we‚Äôre all on the same page. But we‚Äôre on Xbox. Too bad no crossplay :/
---
I've taken shits mid flight with a lovely assistant outside which was more challenging than this dungeon.
---
I get this with the service entrance to the bunker too. Not as frequently as the main resort, mind.
---
I'm talking about an official site/app accessed from any platform.
---
Gonna be hard to find a server where this hasn't been done yet; today, anyways.
---
Yes I am xb1. I am getting on in about 2 hours if you are able. How much do you want for these?
---
This sounds amazing!
---
Would you say the vertibot method is faster than wes tek ?
---
There‚Äôs three challenges! There‚Äôs one to mod a lens and I‚Äôve to take pictures with it
---
Be prepared to spend a ton of Caps. Aluminum and steel are expensive until this is removed
---
This. It‚Äôs such a simple feature it‚Äôs almost common sense. Why wouldn‚Äôt we want to do that? That‚Äôs why I always just go into photo mode
---
Oh thanks for letting me know. Yeah, it was already opened for me so that makes sense. Very meh lol. I swam around underwater looking for a cache or passage.
---
By sheer accident I set up my camp next to the cabin for the event over a black titanium ore patch thus I frequently catch the event right before it ends.
---
Not a review but [this](https://youtu.be/BwelJNlyaiA) is hilarious
---
Leadership bobble head, Cranberry juice. Well rested (if with a friend) Inspirational perk. as far as i know they stack
---
It did. But this hasn't stopped them from giving us a camera challenge. There goes those free Atoms.
---
Those other daily challenges like taking a picture of other players, I wonder if they can be completed with just photo mode?
---
Just repairing and killing it over and over?
---
Does it sell well?
---
would be happy if the just instanced the more... populated indoor areas, like the Burrows, West-Tek, Rob-Co, etc, and gave us the option to choose a difficulty to run it on. It shouldn't be that hard to instance things, and as a matter of fact every other online RPG I've played instanced content because it was a better player experience AND improved performance. So it's really a win-win. Why we haven't seen that in FO76 yet is beyond me.
---
Almost did the same. Was ready to power level for some new perks, farm some ammo/fusion cores. Glad I didn't waste my time
---
Except I put that in quotes, which should indicate some sort of sarcasm you missed. I‚Äôve been playing since beta, nice try though. You can‚Äôt do a few dailies, so what? Your life has moved on and the world hasn‚Äôt stopped. You‚Äôve responded so I take it you‚Äôre still alive. See, everything isn‚Äôt exploding because Bethesda hurt your feelings.
---
To clarify, level 100 = no life, but you having a level "256 legit" within the first few months of the game = ...?
---
Also, protip: arbitrarily capitalizing letters *does not* add credibility to a rambling, incoherent internet rant.
---
Ooohhh, I thought you placed those.
---
I felt underwhelmed at the overall Sheepsquatch quest because when I completed it I didn't know I had completed it because someone had already recalled the assaultron
---
Fixed it
---
It's the armor-piercing, which I didn't know they had till now
---
just killed someone that was in excavator down there in survival dropped tons of shit
---
Yea.
---
LMAO Holy s\*\*t . Who did you piss off to have that happen?
---
Atom rewards, in general, are laughable and inconsistent. Explore Appalachia for 7600 hours for like 20 atoms...weee doggy. Playing the game for 8 hours a day for over 2 1/2 years should grant some a tad bit better
---
How much experience do you get for each repair?
---
Same thing I did
---
You won't catch me online until around 8:30-9pm eastern.  I'm probably good for 1k for both of them. Unless you got a bunch of 5mm/10mm that you can trade me. I'd take that too instead of caps.
---
Probably 2 different groups of people. Those who didn't like the difficulty of Sheepsquatch probably aren't making posts/ comments about the lack of difficulty in the Burrows
---
cranberry relish gives 10% xp for an hour also you can stack that with well rested 5% xp
---
Sleeping bonus, inspirational perk, cranberry relish. 400 xp a bird. Be careful who you do it with. You want to utilize those resources. 50 birds will be 6 aluminum 8 steel per bird. Gotta tag it to get xp. Sometimes there's too many people and you average 1/3 or 1/4 a bird.
---
If there was ever a time to validate that they literally don't play their own game, this was it.
---
So that was Bethesda's logic of "Challenging Dungeon". Throw a bunch of the only enemies with armor piercing into 1 room. SMH
---
Yes. It‚Äôs more costly, but I got from level 1-24 in 10 mins (with another buddy), then grinded out the rest. I made a survival mode post a while back, but I used this method to boost level so I could pvp earlier.
---
I was level 50 in about a day, and over the past week/s I‚Äôve climbed to 80. Started this character with the release of survival, and now he‚Äôs my main character.
---
Real men don‚Äôt sit...ever.
---
It was pretty ridiculous. I can facehug the SBQ and have to use stimpacks as expected, but the imposter sheepsquatch hit so hard you didn't even have a chance to use stimpacks. Then add in the eyebombs and 20 Gutsies and you're just taking more damage and losing more durability than the rewards were worth. I did it 3 times and stopped. Wasn't worth the investment to me. Plus the vultures that started showing up just to swoop in and grab your junk bag.
---
I found it on the table right next to the armor workbench.
---
Someone likes Megadeth...LOL.
---
Lol tight
---
I want to say close to 600, but that‚Äôs dependent on inspirational and other buffs.
---
Just hit lvl 99 sneak sniper leaver action as well and I am just using vats to two shot the gouls in there, headshotting when I have time and so far the greatest foe was a Disconnect
---
It should definitely be that way, and I imagine it will be. This game has so much potential.
---
They really should have some kind of Atom Store app if they are going to do this kind of stuff.
---
All that troubleshooter armor that everyone dumps at the vendor actually comes in handy. Put that on and miraculously the Gutsy are just average opponents. Also makes silo runs easy.
---
Yeah I wonder how the stat is calculated now, I wonder if the explosive damage is now seperate and the 20% damage increase applies to the explosive damage seperately
---
WTH? How do you have an army of rabbits and why?
---
That's your take on this? "Who cares if the only way to make Atoms besides buying them is literally not possible? Skip them."
---
Bruh. Of course I'm going to skip them, they... are... not... possible. ü§ó
---
And of course I'd rather they do things when they have them actually ready, but don't give us challenges and quests that aren't even possible? 
---
I really don't think that's asking too much from a company.
---
Yes! Like some of the radiant quests from FO4. As much as I hated that BoS guy at the police station, I did do his quests quite frequently. Made for a good time kill and gave me a purpose. Sure, I can go on my own and clear out a town or building, but that's not as rewarding as doing it for someone. Maybe I'm weird like that. Then give me some bonus xp or loot for doing it. Making Appalachia safer for everyone. That's the same reason I will take down any scorchbeast I see.
---
That'd still be giving your character items from off the internet. Which doesn't make sense in a post-apocalyptic game. Who's gonna supply it? Who's gonna know where to deliver it and do so? Think about a little bit of logic
---
Also stay out of party that way you can yell at other people area chat. Example hey your not doing this with us unless you put in your fair share. Do it with one or two people. Go a little bit slower. No point in power leveling high levels. Just power leveling mules or a pvp character.
---
They've been dailies since launch but triggering the quests is buggy as fuck. They all work the first time but it's a craps shoot after. Did my first Mire daily in months earlier. Got really excited that they'd been fixed and jumped on a different char to do again. Nothing, still broke.
---
It opened up with the weekly reset, no updated necessary
---
But I like your thinking. Maybe in another game?
---
That takes me about 7 seconds on average to perform each kill. It‚Äôs much faster but much more costly than West tell
---
I just think of it as a public dungeon
---
For real, when I saw that challenge the first time I literally laughed.
---
It's a mistake. They make plenty of those. But I can perfectly understand why. I don't care about having a challenge in there I can't do yet. I'll do one of the other thousand ones.
---
I swear I wasn't memeing Todd
---
What? I just did it with a bloodied heavy build (high rad / low health) Everything is litterally one shot and nothing came close to causing me grief as a single player.
---
'Tis a fine pasture, but sure it is no CAMP.
---
You not caring about something doesn't mean no one else is allowed to care.
---
I noticed it as well... two of us waltzed Uranium Fever, with singles spawning all in the same spot. We camped it to win.  So, that being said... the complaints about the Burrows being super easy with low spawns.. could this be related? I remember UF being much tougher, but that was a couple months ago.
---
Tomorrow. Supposedly.
---
I waited a week on Sheepsquatch and I‚Äôm glad I did. I was able to take my time and explore without a bunch of people zooming around and getting in the way and breaking immmersion. Don‚Äôt forget the 4 side quests too!
---
What? that's insane! why did they say so? How do I  access it what did they add?
---
Must *have*
---
Everyone on your team block the entire map for session. Periodically keep reblocking. The more that come over there the more time wasted and annoying it gets. Do this at 130am until 5am. You'll be good. But do it now. They are gonna remove that bird soon.
---
How much do you want for that weightless combat armor leg?
---
Literally all of my challenges today were camera-related, I was puzzled, I thought they must've dropped the camera early.
---
Damn, I need to learn how to do that
---
I don't know if it's the 3 hour cool off or the 2,000 cap paywall but I hardly ever catch the event on PC without server hopping.
---
It seems server hopping is the only way to farm legendaries.
---
Exactly the same my friend. TD2 has gripped me completely, except for the odd casual game of Apex cos it‚Äôs so easy to pick up. See you out there Agent!
---
The place is cool, honestly, you can get lost in it at first and it's a first ;)  
---
It's more like the glasses cavern in term of duration and probably difficulty. (meaning: not difficult)
---
If you come here as a fresh lvl50 without a good gear you might find that a bit difficult... I don't know...
---
But if you have anything that can one shot/2 shot mobs, it's just a picnic.
---
However it's not the dungeon  we saw in the trailer. there is something else not far away for sure (arktos?)
---
We should have the option to cancel the sitting animation
---
When I did the burrows, some other dude was doing the dropped connection enclave event in Harper‚Äôs. I got the quest reward as well, even though I was in a separate cell.
---
I want an enemy that throughs turds , shoots nipple lasers, and gets a MASSIVE rocket launcher hardon for anyone carrying a toaster.
---
Finally someone gets it!!  Thank you.
---
Right now the only benefit is that you get extra time before you're kicked off for inactivity.  Same goes for beds, adds 50% to your AFK timer IIRC.
---
"Challenging as a Cheeto" is my new favorite phrase
---
Did it take you out? Did it present you with a challenge?
---
If not, good for you. 
---
They did the same thing with Encryptid. The Imposter takes out many if not most players easily AND there's the added challenge of a bunch of Eyebombs and Gutsy Strikebreakers. They threw a bunch of enemies that do big damage in one place. 
---
If you're unhappy, I am sorry for that. As someone said below, people have different experiences with this one.
---
Haha, that's exactly why I'm doing them. Spent ten minutes in the new "dungeon" and then find this thread for more to do.
---
The last bit made me jump lol. Not what you want in such a confined space on a squishy character.
---
If you read back you'll see I only gave my own opinion and never forced anyone to feel the same.
---
I‚Äôm just saying that because most characters look like they are in their 30‚Äôs being born in the vault.
---
How did you get this quest? Don't remember see it on the board. Looked it up and can't find an answer
---
Was this a drop from the Imposter Sheepsquatch kill or another event?
---
The sit command is actually really useful. What, am I going to *stand* on my porch with my shotgun and bourbon?
---
Ah, yes... the Douchebag General role. 
---
Everyone loves the mic-spamming DB General.
---
See also: Sheepsquach battle.
---
When you don't know name of something and you have no time to google, improvise. Haha
---
They could also easily analyze our farming areas and gradually nerf those as we over-farm them while buffing other less-frequented locations. Really shift the meta around constantly. Force us into other areas of the map. I loved how the sheepsquatch quests forced me to finally explore the Ash Heap, which I had never done beyond getting the 2 holotapes.
---
Average Baters on YouTube he's an absolute legend.
---
Tell your other teammates that he is being a creep and you have asked him to stop and he won't. Then block him and move on he's not going to stop.
---
Here's my issue. I WOULD pay for it, IF they delivered amazing content. I have zero problem paying $15 per month for a premium online Fallout experience. But instead, we get half assed  (hell, not even half, more like 1/8th assed) "content", and then try to make money from us by offering pay to win garbage in the atom shop.
---
BGS was asked over and over "how will you sustain this game? servers cost money, new content costs money, are you going to pay for all of that with just cosmetics from the atom shop?". And BGS said "yes". Well, now we're seeing what we get with that pricing model.
---
Good job. It took me several deaths to get through.
---
I guess defined well geared. I have a Bloodied Gatling Gun and standard PA and it was zero challenge. Anyone can get something similar with little to no effort after hitting level 50.
---
Is that you Dave (Mustaine)?
---
I'm level 7 and an finding it very hard to get more than 50 rounds of anything. Does it get easier?
---
Also looking for a rad suit that's way too get at my noob level
---
Haven't done it myself, just picked up stuff from the sub here. 
---
Think you just go to Harper's it should pop up a quest marker etc. 
---
I think they dropped Fasnacht in the same way.
---
Oh you mean like the atom shop?
---
Is it something i can just jump into with a friend or two or do i need a bunch of people from the server as well?
---
My Gatling gun gets stuck in ADS. While stuck I can‚Äôt use VATS or any D-pad function. The only way out is reloading.
---
‚ÄúMore recently, the Brotherhood of Steel detected strange electronic signatures emanating from the drain system. They sent some of their forces into The Burrows to investigate the source, but none returned...‚Äù
---
‚ÄúThe Burrows is balanced to be a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault Dwellers, but truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone. If you manage to emerge victorious, you‚Äôll receive plenty of loot and experience for your troubles.‚Äù
---
I‚Äôd say that is hyping it up
---
Still no progressive content after 5 Months since release. Wow. Just wow. Even scarlet blade with dem big titties had better content than this game. Why should i kill sheepsquatch more than one time? Farming whitespring was and still is the better farming spot. But why should i farm stuff? I got my 3* Weapons and good gear, all needed perks, reached lv. 120+, got all PA with tons of paint jobs, calibrated shocks etc. Why should i even start the game? I have no clue at all.
---
Harpers Ferry sewers (you see the on map icons when you get there) and whole lot of disappointments is what they added.
---
If only that would fit in a porta potty....
---
It's common practice. Someone criticizes your choices? Just remove the ability to criticize.
---
Got a 3\* to drop an Assassin's Explosive Gatling Gun with +15% fire rate, I can't complain at all
---
ive barely seen many people use a fatman due to the weapon's weight. i use one but i kind of would prefer to have an instigating crippling weightless one, instead of one with reload speed
---
I was hoping for giant rad widows that spray webs at your feet while teammates have to try to decipher a puzzle that stops the walls from crushing your pee pee , and laser nipples , because lasers and nipples are both good
---
Mechanics! Yes please Bethesda
---
Have you missed the maybe 1 or 2 posts on the subject? It went live 5pm GMT and was finished by around 5.05 GMT.
---
You gotta do free states missions to get the key.
---
It is definately a dungeon as Bethesda would define it. Think Skyrim. The problem is no one else expected this. They shiukd have set expectations better.
---
Well that could mean that nuking works after all
---
Not sure if it works on rugs still, but I have my purifiers on-top of fires
---
I don't want to say yes just yet because I am not sure but we had a similar experience it seems.
---
Encrypted was fun the first time. Like actually enjoyed the challenge. Then it got annoying. Now I just go to hold a pylon and watch melee builds die in one hit.
---
I changed mine and still had my atom store stuff
---
Right? Bunch of babies if you ask me
---
No, sorry.  Just you.  :-)
---
Majestic af
---
I agree the group needs more healers, and tanks honestly. IMO we really need some repeatable endgame content to help drive that home too
---
Mole Rats are just the worst.  Why?  Because you can't ignore them.  They'll follow you halfway across the map, all but forcing you to stop whatever you're doing and wait for them to unburrow, give you a disease, and die in one hit.
---
No üòÇü§£üòÜ wish they could! We‚Äôd overthrow the bots at Whitesprings
---
A dungeon requires thought. This ‚Äúquest‚Äù even gave arrows to point in the direction you are suppose to go.
---
A dungeon should require playing with others. This can be done solo...
---
I‚Äôm apexigod. Duh üòÇü§£üòÜ
---
Like the campfires under lights?
---
It's hard to look away from the fire
---
What plans?
---
Awww to bad. Hilarious though. üòÅüòÅüòÅ
---
Which plans? Were they quest rewards or spawns?
---
That's how it's done. Like hey blakthumb you cheap skate you want to use our steel and aluminum give me 1000 caps or material or get the hell out of here
---
I did not see it while I was busy with the "dungeon"
---
players still show up on the map, even if they are crouched, unless they have you blocked
---
Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but AA on Tesla is worthless currently because AA doesn't reduce energy resistance (as in, regardless of the weapon damage type, AA reduces enemy ballistic resistances). The issue is present across all armor reducing effects, including perk cards, weapon mods, and legendary effects.
---
And downvoted by the people who can't handle criticism of this game. The game is far too easy and they continue to make it no challenge at all
---
There we go, yet another "but p2w" regarding a feature yet to be implemented which we also don't know the exact facts behind how it will be implemented other than a paragraph in a news article.
---
Some days I feel like I'm on the short bus as well.  Tried Survival mode and I think I'm 0 - 15.  I just don't have the weapons to do any kind of range attack and the others take me down in a few shots.  Been trying to farm better gear but seem to junkies, zealots, mutant slayer, exterminators, hunters, etc.   Can't seem to find any of the other armor / weapons that are good for pvp.
---
How did that go?
---
I used 3 stimpaks, level 65. 
---
Not impressed
---
Armor plans, in the chest beside the terminal where you kill the Assaultron dominator. Red chest.
---
Got armor plans. 3 were in there.
---
Yeah I'm pretty pissed that they do crap like this!  Also didn't fix plans you know from known plans at vendors.  "Hey, it's not pay to win in the atomic shop, you can get them from challenges" "gives impossible to complete challenges, literally".  I would like some free atom points for shit like this!
---
Oh yea... lets male them bigger and tougher. Na but seriously my ones wont burrow underground, it probably aint a good idea but I think it would be cool.
---
No, we can't... Not being able to do so completely nullifies my desire to waste my caps on the toilet and port- a- potty.
---
Anything new?
---
Sometimes when sitting in a chair on a second floor I will stand up, turn slightly, and phase through the wall only to fall to the ground outside.
---
Behind the machine shop in Huntersville on PC tends to be T-45 more often than not. IIRC, the spawn behind the Red Rocket south of Harper's Ferry was as well this morning.
---
Would be a real fun death match level
---
Hum... thank you guys for asking and replying. Take your time Beth. Theres still a lot to do to win that survival challenge, anyway. Buuut, free atoms? Yes please?
---
It's the matrix
---
Second the Again
---
Lol no
---
Yeah, but the pups go away as soon as you switch to an actual weapon. So if you‚Äôre just going to track things so you can stay away, I guess they‚Äôre good. But not for combat.
---
yeah if teams spawned at opposite ends or something that would be cool
---
"innocent"
---
Have you looked at Elder Scrolls Blades? It's one of the most egregious P2W pieces of garbage ever created. I've stood behind this game for a LONG time and waited for them to get their shit together, but none of the new content has been anything even close to resembling an end game. 
---
This is an online RPG that wants you to keep playing but has fuck all to do once you finish the story.
---
I genuinely think they don't play their own game.  And if they do, they don't seem to possess a deep understanding of it.
---
I don't know how else you can explain things like the scrapping bulk snafu, weighted Bobby pins, instant-exploding Legendary robots, inability to apply mods, goofy new repair workflow, etc.  Someone changed all these things and didn't have the wisdom to notice "Oh, hey, that's not working like it did before."
---
So they're not fixing the bug that stops me from applying mods to gear?
---
Hey, I am having the same problem and I don't have any mods. Is there any other reasons why it would be doing this?
---
It was!
---
thanks for the heads up, sorry that happened to ya
---
Yeah!
---
Obsidian...There's a pleasant flashback.....
---
Have a local friend who has been playing since beta - I wanted to chat with him when I started playing, so had to learn the mic.
---
I run solo most of the time, but have grown accustomed to having an open mic (area chat).  (Easier than pushing all the buttons to turn it on/off.)
---
A lot of it just depends on how I feel.  You know those anti-social days....
---
Sometimes, I just walk along with another player without creating a team, and BS about whatever, or simply call out - workbench over here - ghoul mob, whatever.  Just opened the safe, need any (item)?
---
Sometimes, I get somone who sounds like they are pre-teen, others, I get people closer to (our) age.   
---
Much like IRL, the younger ones don't seem to want to fight and dont care enough about the story or follow a questline, older players are content to cruise along and explore.
---
The issue with subscription based MMO's now is we're seeing mmo popularity on consoles more and more. Both X-box and PSN require you to have a subscription to even play a game online now so that increases the cost on the consumer end.  So if you're making an MMO with the intent for it to be multi-platform you want to stay away from putting pay-to-connect in front of pay-to-connect.
---
It also allows players to stop playing and continue playing whenever they want. The reason I stopped playing WoW was because I'd go a month or two without playing and **if** I wanted to hop back in, I had to commit to a minimum amount of time that I might not even use. The MTX model allows players to come and go as they please, someone might only play on weekends but spend 10 bucks each weekend on things, whereas that same person might not see the value of spending 15 bucks a month if they will only play on weekends.
---
I think the MTX model has its merits, it creates a wider player base but I think it also promotes more players with less investment and a more casual mindset. Where as the subscription model leads to more invested players who take the game more seriously and have a tighter community. I saw the difference on Star Trek: Online when the transition from Subscription to F2P happened.
---
I don't think a subscription model would benefit Fallout 76. One of the main things you see with subscription models is expansions that cost extra money. The expansions are usually bigger than a typical DLC you'd see in F2P (honestly I don't think anything Bethesda released so far should be called DLC). I can't think of more than a couple scenarios that the community as a whole would shell out 15 bucks a month and 60 bucks a year on ex-pacs to play FO76.
---
Well its been 4mins from the post. I am sure they r completed by now.
---
It definitely has tons of useful materials to get but most of us endgame veterans don't need any more, but good for newer players.  
---
It was an ok place with good atmosphere, i expected more mystery or lore and definitely more challenge getting through.  
---
But the most disappointing thing for me, was the last encounter, a generic robot, really that was not cool ;(
---
Hence why I suggested the pips could stay somehow. They last for like one second which is unfortunate
---
 The reflex sight on my Western Revolver pretty well zooms x2 when used. I use it to search for stuff in the area quite a bit.
---
It's always fun.
---
How did they lie to you ?
---
It's a named assaultron blade. Improved damage + vampire effect
---
I figured smth like it would happen eventually, I just wanna make sure nobody else wastes their time on them!
---
Lol wish you could respawn inside dungeons that the entrances
---
It‚Äôs from the new Cryptid hunter mission. Start from the southern belle motel. Look at the tables near boomer.
---
Awesome! I also captured mine on a few xbox clips.
---
Talk to ghouls/human players with x 01 power armor they love radiation not to mention rad x/rad away also.
---
I mean, this has 3 stages of zoom you can control. Reflex I believe only zooms in one one standard amount, does it not?
---
Dude.. you can justify being that douche that thinks he gets to tell other players how to play, all you want... nobody likes that asshat that screams into his mic while telling other people how to enjoy their game.
---
Balls, that was empty when I got down there..
---
Wow! Nice job.
---
New side-quest added today, starts with a note at the Southern Belle Motel.
---
Never anticipated everyone having God tier weapons. I wonder how much correlation there is between dupers and end game content being too easy.
---
That's because the goal of wild appalachia wasn't "an end game"
---
Yeah. It's always crazy there.
---
Now you just gave me an idea to create a "Rust In Peace" themed dungeon that ties the alien studies conducted at TNT Dome 2 with a new location called "Hangar 18"...
---
I wish I had more to say than others have already said.
---
Perhaps what I can add to all the other posts about it, is that I also felt a general confusion overall. I didn't really feel any sense of association as to why I should be there, or what the quest was for that matter, and then once understood, why it was a relevant quest. The ending can be confusing as well because it simply is not what you expect for an ending.
---
1 shotting the ghouls would be fine, if there were swarms of them, but there's like ~50 in the whole "dungeon".
---
I think the list of ‚Äúthat wasn‚Äôt intended‚Äù stuff is about 10 times the size of the actually correct stuff in the game by nowüòÇ
---
Oh...those innocent players with 99999999999 ammo are still banned? I can't believe this

We are on our way to the front desk to overthrow the bots....
---
Think of all the circuits, glass, and plastic you could get though
---
Well, if I'm on, hit me up. I'm always up for a queen fight. GT Pa3ndr4g0n. 
---
You've got the axe for it, but how hard are you hitting with it? How high is your strength during a queen fight? How are you boosting it?
---
Unless I missed something in there I solo'd it at lvl 80 and other than the first BoS member at the entrances I didnt seen any more. Was kinda disappointed there wasnt more lore. I found one holo tape from someone called Markus to Marge that makes it seem like there was more but I didnt find anything
---
Those will work wonders on my scout character. Great find.
---
Sorry I main a Tesla rifle and I still don't agree. 
---
Energy weapons already get bonuses based of the rifleman/commando perks which ever applies. If they would just fix the damned AA not working for ER they may be in an ok spot. If they add more buffs to energy weapons before fixing AA, then we may well see an energy weapons nerf after AA is fixed.
---
This game would benefit from some instanced events / dungeons you could run fresh with your own team.
---
Well i would say thats info about the Dungeon. Hyping it up would mean them making few articles and maybe a trailer about it.
---
 Oh for sure. I'm just pointing out that its useful, I'm sure the Peepers are even better, although the pistol is always there for me.
---
I hope my camp is hit my griefers so I can bounty rack in on them if not well... There's that one perk that helps workshop that makes it cheap plus I got resources to burn.
---
It's justified. Nothing is free in a nuclear wasteland.
---
It's full of level 48-58-62 generic ghouls, but don't get dissapointed, it's a cool place to explore and has tons of scrap materials around if u need.
---
True, I'm heavy weps anyway.  But they'll fix it anyway due to the visibility of the problem across the board.
---
Thst sounds epic.
---
I thought you were back playing and had uploaded a video of something?
---
Yes we are missing a dungeon.
---
 I just use other weapons, to funnel the chain of fools onto my knives. ;)
---
Other than the entrances were there any brotherhood corpses, terminals, holotapes or notes in there I found the doctors terminal and 1 holotape in the last room and that's it
---
everything should be solo able imo with the option to group. just like any single player game the content should be open to all to enjoy. That being said i am a little biased because i play alone. Not by choice mind you i just don't do well with people. i don't speak unless spoken too. I don't trade with others. i just play the game.
---
I agree.  You don't need to have it every hour on the hour, but Helvetia is so depressing and empty without it.
---
Ty

I don't think you quite understand the meaning of the word literally... or all...
---
Lately on PS4 she‚Äôs been about a ten minute kill give or take.
---
The Burrows Night Club, coming soon..two for one nukashine and lady toons get in for free!
---
There are a lot of frustrating things with the button mapping. Rest, sit, and "drink the shitty toxic water" should all be "press and hold" actions to avoid this bullshit.
---
Also, whoever thought it was a good idea to have "invite to team" and "climb out of your power armor" mapped to the same button is a fucking moron.
---
I love that the invite to team is same as exit power armor.   Cant tell you how many times I have jumped outta my PA in a nuke zone trying to team up.
---
Haven't really checked out any posts about it yet. Kinda sucks it didn't have any good continuity to any of the previous stories or characters though even if it was a slight mention, should've had some terminal entries in defiance or something That's what I'm getting from what you've said although I could be way off. I was going to try to get through it in a bit. ü§û
---
Hello bud. I got my gear and caps together, so when you are available send me a message.
---
I need 2 pieces upgraded to BOS, and 4 pieces deep pocketed, so shall we call it 700 caps.
---
No rush and no pressure.
---
Thanks for your input!
---
Not gonna argue about that deep pockets is pretty useful at least it adds more lbs instead of mitigating the weight. Weightless enchantments though make pocketed worth something (I did some number crunching).
---
It‚Äôs all gone disco.
---
Those were raids thou? Least Kaz was. I think OG shattered halls.  God damn BC release dungeons required perfect crowd control.
---
I wanted to change my ID.....but after further reading, it affects other games as well. For instance the game " The last of Us" which is one of my favs. So until this gets fixed, I will keep my PSN ID for now
---
I tried to leave my opinion spoiler free, while still including the main points, disassociation and confusion
---
bombfetti has a few ones, but he isn‚Äôt making anymore 76 stuff.
---
Considering only junk is supposed to drop in adventure, we sure have a lot of worries...
---
I've had a mini heart attack at a vendor when I briefly thought I had lost my lever action. Turns out I just forgot that the skin I applied prevents the sale.
---
Acquiring a new legendary, that's another scary thing. I try to remain active on the game for a minimum of half an hour after acquiring a good legendary. In the early days I lost more than one legendary to crashes/server issues.
---
I check my inventory every single time on login to reassure myself that I haven't lost any legendaries. Sure would be nice to be able to lock items from dropping, scrapping and trading.
---
It comes in handy in clutch situations..I'm always overencumbered
---
imho, fast traveling is a single player mechanic that doesn't belong in the multiplayer version of the game
---
Hot Fix Please! ASAP another week to wait is killin me
---
that's fair, all the games i play were on the no known bugs list or were confirmed by others to be working for them &amp; i haven't had any problems thus far, but i was very hesitant to lose progress in some of my older games so i don't blame you.
---
Just have it be a "bugged event" that randomly kicks on at a very low percentage.
---
It was like, ‚ÄúPSYCH, GOTCHA! Real invasion is in a month, gotta wait until then!‚Äù. That was a big let down lmao.
---
That's a good price for. Persudo-unlimited (due to the need to hop profiles) weight .
---
Yes! It needs to be a thing! Having a nice nuke cola getting refreshed maybe eat a bag of potatoe crisps or fancy lads snack cakes while looking out from a high survey area needs to be allowed!
---
Yeah, this game sucks cuz of the engine.  How much of an ignorant person do YOU have to be to think a game engine from nearly fifteen years ago would be viable?  If they used a better engine, EVERYTHING in this game would function better.  You OBVIOUSLY have no fucking idea what you're talking about bro.
---
If you are having trouble launching the game I would suggest you uninstall the game and the Bethesda.net launcher and after restarting your PC reinstall them both. It will take some time but it is worth a try. Don't use the repair tool as there is a higher chance for it to work if you reinstall completely from scratch. Probably some files went corrupt after the launcher patched your game. Good luck!
---
Meh.
---
Hit L2 on it in build mode
---
There‚Äôs no plan. Just hover over doors or purifiers and a button on the bottom will say lock. Mine is L2 on PS4
---
Nah it's a very passive learning thing of course if done repeatedly your gonna get better at it.
---
Yeah, you have to use as part of main quest. You‚Äôll eventually be directed towards it.
---
What system do you play on? For Xbox1 it‚Äôs the left trigger. No plans needed.
---
I wonder if nuking the Burrows would make it harder/add mobs.
---
I've loved it every time I've got the chance to do it. I guess I've been a bit vague. I'm an unarmed melee. Last time I got the chance to do Encryptid was just after I bought my new favorite weapon: a bloodied 3* mole miner gauntlet with one of the perks being reflecting damage back when blocking. THAT made a HUGE difference when fighting the Imposter. I guess this was just a fun side story lol
---
FYI there is a lv50 version of the alien blaster.
---
Same here.
---
Clearly never played to late game
---
What lore? 3 holos?
---
You're*
---
I love camp building. Probably my favorite thing to do
---
where is it located at my mate
---
He is.  Just posted a couple days ago about a level 32 taking him out while he had 5x Sentinel and 5X assassin armor while he was a level 265.
---
I'll for sure try both of those. I'll have to drop bloody mess but I think having the bloodied weapon will help counter that.
---
Summer is almost here anyway. Gives me a good reason to go outside and enjoy. Shelving my console til winter I think.
---
Okay so is this a limited time thing?
---
It's direct correlation. The amount of TSE/assassin-sent shit would be reduced by 1000% without the duping fiasco
---
And when you did see someone with it on? It would either be he had payed out the dick or had RNGesus on his side
---
Wanna know what grinds my gears? Seeing a wall not able to build despite being attached clearly it's excuse is "object is floating"
---
It's asshole behaviour... we don't live in a wasteland, We spend our days dealing with people telling us what to do, all day, in our real lives... video games are an escape from that.
---
At least put a wall light below it ;-)
---
I'm not calling you a liar or saying some sort of exploit or loophole doesn't exist, but what you're describing is not how the game works. Other players can't build in your CAMP or workshop unless you're on a team together.
---
Uhh, what burrows did you go through? I found about 15 legendaries in my hour down there, including two 3* ghouls (3* bloodied handmade and 2* hunter's baseball bat) and a 2* assaultron dominator at the end (although she didn't drop a legendary item lmao). The rest were legendaries without stars, but still legendary nonetheless
---
After everyone else logs off just say......later creepy dude.  Don't feel bad about it, he is the one being creepy.
---
&gt;[The Burrows is balanced to be a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault Dwellers, but truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone.](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1QMBfEfLfsdy3ho9eYMoQ0/inside-the-vault-the-burrows-and-camera-preview)
---
Maybe ITS challenging for level 50-51 players, but not most of us that have good gear and builds xD
---
I'll wait until much later I'm waiting tell the legendary vender  comes out.
---
You don't know what you're talking about. It was **documented** that they lowered the damage tables. They **responded** to the accusations, stating that they were correcting it to the previous amounts.
---
You should really try to stay informed, before talking out of your ass.
---
There is no 4* legendary so hoping that was a typo and what exactly did GTAVO have at release? It sure wasn't heists or substantial missions. If you were lucky enough to log on there was a handful of crappy missions and races and deathmatch maps. One reason GTAVO has stuff to grind for now is because the payouts are crap and everything is overpriced so they can sell shark cards. You could have picked a lot of examples of complete online games at release but GTAVO is 100% not one of them. All  GTAVO had at release was a ton of grind for overpriced shit with very little content. Heists was the first substantial content it got over a year later.
---
Well maybe if they turn it back on. We might actually get a chance to get the old man winter mask. üòÇüòÇ
---
Inon Zur's tracks are fucking awesome, but he really outdid himself with this one. My biggest issue has always been the seemingly lack of different 'in combat' tracks, but as far as tracks for zones go the burrows one is atmospheric as fuck and i love it
---
It frees up my stash room so me too. I built two fusion reactors so if one went down (due to player involvement most likely) the turrets will still be active to rain hell on that person.
---
yea but they patched that only works if you had it before the patch
---
I‚Äôm only at 300 hours, so there‚Äôs still plenty of stuff left to keep me playing
---
I thought the same thing
---
And content.
---
Agreed 100%. I soloed it in about 10 minutes. And don't even have that good of a build.
---
Or one of those floor mounted spot light pointing up to it, on a timer switch.... BOO!
---
Ok ? Is there a difference in meaning?
---
&gt;  the more I question that this is the same company that‚Äôs capable of putting out DLC like Shivering Isles it Far Harbor.
---
That's because it's not the same company.
---
Bethesda Austin is the studio handling FO76. This is a totally different studio from the actual Bethesda which is busy creating Starfield and the next Elder Scrolls game.
---
Where's is that?
---
Cosmetics are different from the essential food and ammo. Pay attention!
---
Big oof. I was really looking forward to growing some in door crops. Thanks anyway!
---
...tell your other two friends you need to choose between the letcher who can't take no for an answer or you.   
---
If they side with him, you need a less shit team.
---
"Ya know my brother once told me nothing someone says before the word but really counts"

To be fffaaaiiirrrrrr
---
I don't find no Deathclaw Easter Egg in my floor decoration and I don't have the Deathclaw statue or Power Armor statue line is it because of that I can't find my Egg ?
---
Im sure I‚Äôll enjoy it. I mean, ive probably spent 100hours just clearing West Tek over and over. Another spot to add to the farming rotation is alright by me.
---
Quality &gt; quantity
---
I have never been griefed once, but i have had people visit
---
Assaultron? Whaa? All I got was an empty chest and two, 3* mons that both dissapeared before I could loot them.
---
Yeah..."innocent" players...
---
Wow. Talk about a come back story!
---
Gets banned and then comes back and grinds the RNG for another complete set of Assassin's Sentinel armor....what are the odds of that?  He's like the Tiger Woods of Fallout 76.
---
I was like a lot of people, disappointed. I wasn't expecting the fight of a life time going down there, but maybe there were some cool lore. Even in that department, I got severely let down.
---
There was nothing new down there, and them re-using nuka-cola world machines for a GIANT pump station was just blatantly obvious. 
---
I found 1 legendary enemy, and I searched every corner of the new location. For my troubles, I got the underwhelminging "gutter" and another ghoul slayers leather item, low level (The legendary vendor can not get here soon enough).
---
The layout of the location was highly confusing, and more annoying to traverse, than a challenge. The enemies were just normal ghouls, and there were definitely more level 42 ghouls than level 60+ (I am level 218).
---
I found a place where I could turn a lever, and open an underground gate to a footlocker, which had randomized loot inside it, so now I know thats not worth it another time. 
---
The most valuable item I got for going down there, was the 5 caps a low level ghoul spawned with after dying. If I can get better rewards going around Whitesprings and killing stuff, it's just not worth it. And no, I'm not saying we should get god rolled legendaries from doing "the burrows", I'm just saying they could have done so much more with it. 
---
I am also not saying that they should nerf Whitesprings, I'm saying they should raise The Burrows to the same level, at least.
---
 Even at Whitesprings, you can find several different kind of enemies (ghouls, radstags, wendigo, giant sloth, deathclaws, Mutated bee monster, etc), but at The Burrows", all you get is a few robots, and some ghouls.
---
Smoke grenades sure, but flash bangs that blind a character is probably a bad idea because it takes away player agency.
---
knock back summa dat sweet nuka shine, then you wont have to worry about sittin'...
---
That's what I thought as well but as we all know there still are some bugs to be worked out. I sent a message to Bethesda about it a few months ago, and they did say they would look into it. How ever I imagine it would take some time to actually get to it. Unless it is a common problem which I doubt.
---
Just wanted to pop in and let you know that you are, in fact, being a douche. If you‚Äôre not aware, it‚Äôs actually possible to answer peoples questions without being a douche. You should try it out some time.
---
Exploring the Burrows was kinda cool because it was a new location but to call it a dungeon is laughable.  All there was was a bunch of Ghouls and a few Robots.  The boss at the end, if you want to call it that, was not even a Legendary.
---
I see no replay value there.  I came across one Legendary in the entire thing.  The only rewarding bit was all the junk you could collect, especially Lead and Steel.  The unique weapon seems like it could be pretty good if you have the right build.
---
I also could not get invested in the story.  I really have no idea how the Brotherhood of Steel was involved.  All I know is that is was a nice community until some guy decided he wanted to be the leader and stop sharing his shit.  Or something like that.
---
I appreciate that Bethesda is slowly giving us new content but this was incredibly lame, especially in comparison to the Sheepsquatch story.  If Bethesda just threw a Gun Runner‚Äôs Arsenal type of DLC our way I think it would be better received.  New weapons to cater to all builds would be great.  A Shoulder Mounted Machine Gun for Heavy Gunners, a Bumper Sword for Melee users, etc.  Not to mention their would be Legendary variants to farm for.
---
I did it without even a legendary weapon
---
I first went in and was asked to join a couple players on a team. I thought I better because of the 'hype', I had heard it was too much for a solo player, even though I usually decline team requests. So after about a 'hundred of yards' of travel I realized I could handle it and following these two guys at their pace was going to be too fast to soak it all in I switched servers.
---
I got into one where I think I was the first to enter and it stayed that way for a long time. Also I decided to try out my lvl 50 'The Fixer' to see if it really had a sneak bonus (it does) and to see if it was the just right gun for this place (it is).
---
I had a blast, almost died a bunch of times. A few times I had to run or jump to a place I could heal quickly.
---
I think two things will make this location a players favorite:
---
1) for PVP in Survival and if they could do a different mode of PVP where you have two teams/factions trying to drive each other out....both start at different ends (or one faction tries to hold the whole thing from an outside invading group). There is so much cover, alternate paths and 'murder hole' ambush architecture to work with it could become like a favorite map from a first person shooter game once the players memorize some of the layout.
---
2) Nuke it!! It would rival White Springs for glowing ones farming
---
And whatever other goodies they have stashed in the dev room that we don't have access to.
---
"Aliens"
---
Kind of disappointed my combat knife took off half her health first stab but the dungeon design was really nice imo I did see a bag when got there, maybe high level cause it was full of good junk. So it must have been challenging to somebody!
---
Nothing is free in this world. I'm telling the guy exactly how the vertibot works. I didn't ask for your opinion nor do I care about it. I'm me your you. You butt into a conversation that has nothing to do with you because your a loser. I'm giving the guy the answer to his question. You chime in with your two cents about my opinion of my gear in game that I worked for. And yes hoarding junk is work. Alot of work. It's not fun and very boring. I'm picturing it right now of you server hopping trying to use everyone's bulk steel and aluminum. Your a bum. You take from others and don't give anything back. Only for yourself. In the union we call people like that rats and scabs.
---
 that's exactly what it is a side quest
---
I got the mounted wendigo
---
Get a power armor and go to nuked whitespring and farm glowing ghouls they give a  lot of exp.  
---
You can also go there to farm regular ghouls but you need to care cause they may spawn higher level than you and you wont be able to kill them without help.  
---
Grab a few workshops (4 or more) and do the defending event for ton of exp from event rewards + kills.
---
I got waaaaay better rewards getting to the sewer than I did in it.  Ran into a 3* and 1* Supermutant going in and the same coming out.
---
Every single daily challenge was camera-related, what don't you understand?
---
But... its not an MMO
---
the grafton steel workshop has a copper node ;-)
---
Alwayyys encumbered that's my gift yet my curse. The only way to solve it is drop everything to see what weighing you down then focus on that thing with all my power to reduce that "tree" weight
---
Yep. Loot everything. I think I found 3.  All 1*
---
To be fair, marketing worked perfectly, hyping it up to the max making us think it would be a cool hard raid....not a 10 minutes dungeon not even worth the time. They succeded in bringing in new players and old players too probably
---
I gladly give you thumbs up here and I'll explain why. I wasn't going to relate my best battle story since it was OP's's tale and about him.  I won't tell it now either because mine happened almost exactly to a tee like yours, just add a lvl. 91 Glowing Deathclaw to the mix and imagine if you accidentally axed one of the Firefighter Protectrons during all this too and you'll get the picture.
---
Seems to be!
---
My wife and I struggled through the first silo together with no PA around level 30-35. Probably took a good 3 hours of chems, lead, and tears before we finally launched. I went the route of PA and heavy weapons, and my wife took the troubleshooter/anti-armor road. Our next run was with her in a full trouble set and anti-armor miner gauntlet, and even though I was in PA, she didn't bat an eye at anything other than the last two assaultrons.
---
I'm availible, tp to me when ready (tell me you ign)
---
Or CL EO(or OE I'm not sure lol) 13 17 works too.
---
That would be cool, we need more nukable place to farm, instead of always whitespring, but being inside i doubt it will have any impact.
---
For real, what is he talking about? The game plays and runs as if it was made alongside Oblivion. Even with max settings on pc the game looks awful. Same old bethesda, releasing a game that has to be fixed by modders.
---
Don't forget about the gut shrooms which I can't figure out what to use for!
---
There's also a holotape in toxic Larry's that upon listening to it will give the miscellaneous objective to investigate the campsite
---
Let me tell you what the average Reddit user is in game:
---
Has Excavator power Armor on at all times. Convinced that it‚Äôs the best thing in the game or a necessary item to play.
---
Wanders the middle of Mire, solo or with one friend half the game.
---
Has a suppressed (non legendary) or TSE Pump Action. Asks for bullets all the time.
---
Always locked at walking speed, they somehow have 400+ pounds of random stuff, most being legendary Weapons they won‚Äôt ever use.
---
Shows up to boss fights and never actually touches the boss. Maybe kills a few adds here and there.
---
Convinced that the loot system is broken, does not calculate anything, or record findings.
---
Usually long winded. Speeches for yes or no questions. 
---
‚ÄúNerf A, buff B! Rework C, BETHESDA PLEASE!‚Äù Typically requests QOL changes, or clearly balance breaking changes.
---
‚ÄúThis! (Tragic story here)‚Äù
---
Level 43-130
---
Carries a ridiculous amount of junk and aid. Literally only using weight reduction cards.
---
‚ÄúReported, enjoy your ban‚Äù *no offense actually took place*
---
Will offer to buy all of your good items with caps. Thinks 2k+ for your Anti Armor weapon is ridiculous.
---
Always talking about ‚Äúfellow vault brothers‚Äù and how ‚Äúgriefers‚Äù are ruining the game. Obsessed with roleplay OR a hatred for aggressive players (oft referred to as raiders or griefers)
---
Owns more than 3 of the workshops on the server, continually surprised when people attempt to claim it and kill them.
---
‚ÄúMy build is really good‚Äù *uses almost entirely weights reduction cards with no damage buffing perks* ‚ÄúBut I think melee is a bit too powerful‚Äù *STR is 13-15*
---
Believes that dupers crashed the in game market, despite never having seriously participated in it. Also hates PVP players with a passion. All players they die to are exploiters or Sent/ass armor users. Can not fathom being killed by anything else.
---
Messages players that kill them with laughing emojis, calls everyone a child, cringe worthy in voice chat. Same response to junk being taken when they die to mobs.
---
Attempts to tell players how to play the game, usually spreads misinformation. 
---
I think I‚Äôve encountered 40 of these people in the last week.
---
Yes, of course it does. That's why there are 2 different words. "You're", is "you are" conjigated. "Your" is possesive. This is *your* grammar lesson for the day. *You're* welcome.
---
The last time someone did that to me they made the mistake of fast traveling to my camp to do it. Respawned at my camp, killed him, then picked up our loot bags and moved camp lol
---
Can't be too careful. Imo plus I had a little bit of budget left.
---
Did it actually reflect damage that was visible? Like a chunk from the health bar? If it did, that would change a lot in my eyes.
---
My camp is right next to this so every time I spawn in I hear the this.
---
Great! My IGN is knave_expiates (which I really regret).
---
That is definitely well geared in this game for pve sadly lol.... Bloodied Gatling gun with serendipity and nerd rage in power armor will trivialize damn near any pve content other than sbq or sheep. This dungeon was a huge disappointment just because the wording made it sound way cooler than it ended up being. It is a nice new area but calling it a dungeon was a bad idea. I honestly hate marketing because it makes everything sound way better than it is without technically lying. If they would have just said "new sewer area with high level enemies and a new quest" I think the outrage would be minimal even though they didn't technically lie with the way they advertised it.
---
No the marketing then failed, it should have been bundled with another dlc or jsut have promoted as a short tease of what's to come
---
I barely ever went there before the parade so I really learned the layout during the event. 
---
I went there on another new character recently and it was just sad. Though I could hear the music playing faintly in my head as soon as I saw the town.
---
I've been running around in the imposter outfit and mask nonstop. No spawns yet. I believe we're still missing something else needed to trigger it.
---
Stupid question probably, but can you remember where that key go to? I searched every corner of The Burrows, but didn't find any place the key could be used.
---
Nothing has been patched today, there was no actual update
---
They are suppose to have 40% AA but some people reported that it could be as high at 90% AA per shot and with two shots per burst yikes.
---
In my experience, yes. Not just for the Imposter but several other enemies.
---
I buy it in bulk when I need it.
---
You tend to find it in electrical items, like Fuses, and those can be found in industrial locations.
---
I did, from all the lead up, believe that this would be the case but now, I can't remember if that was something I got from the Reddit community or the devs somewhere along the way....
---
Anyone know of any others?
---
Thanks for the advice will definitely try it!
---
It was done hyping it up to the max to bring in new players and players who left. They misled us pretty good tbh, their marketing succeded
---
Where can I find this?
---
recommended for 2 players lvl 50+, yeah as if. not even difficult.
---
You use fancy words, me brain hurt.
---
Following for info. How did you hear about the suit ? have you seen it ?
---
Hope maybe a scope in the future with zoom would be nice. I just think peepers are nice cause they weigh less than binoculars and do more than nearly every other scope in the game.
---
How do you get the plans for the other mounted creatures? I've only got the wolf and radstag.
---
it's weird the best drop so far for me western tse 3 star and I did get a godly 3 star arm sen ass arm drop for me.  Two of the most utilitarian weapons that dropped for me are as follows a 1 star hardened 308 that's instigating added a suppressor and its basically a one shot 100 percent in vats, second instigating faster swing speed board modded out with nails another one shot weapon that cost wood and glue to repair use these items way more than my tse handmade or tse lever.  If you find a decent one star it can end up being your most used weapon.  Rng can be a grind I await player vendoring where you will be able to pick up some of these items for cheap. Oh dont forget to check vendors people sell good to you stuff all the time I have picked up a few amour pieces that way.
---
Well, of course they were using level 1 pipe pistols.  They don't have tools available to grant themselves items, remember?
---
Yeah I was away for a couple of days after the Sheepsquatch thing dropped, and finally I was like "oh cool, I will actually die for once and not from my own Double Shot MIRV Fat Man".
---
Got back, joined the event, barely changed my perk cards, event complete. Huh.
---
i spent 2 hrs fast traveling exploring to try and find the camera before googling it to find out its been delayed.
---
Events, are great.
---
Why would players ‚Äúallow‚Äù it? Loooool. You still don‚Äôt understand that it isn‚Äôt our choice to allow or not. I don‚Äôt get to decide for McDonalds when they schedule the McRib or Shamrock Shake based on my personal vacation schedule and I don‚Äôt get to demand they give me compensation if I choose to be unavailable that day. For fuck sake man, how entitled are you?
---
Yeah. I have 3 structures at mine atm
---
Me and 2 friends went through it in ten minutes ....  idk maybe its broken or someone had just cleared it...either way its another poorly implemented piece of content.
---
Awesome, something new to slot into my jukebox playlist.
---
If you only believe in short-term gain, sure.  Long-term, I think we're all a little more skeptical.
---
Well I haven‚Äôt heard anything about it being in-game but in the burrows news tab it shows the rescue diver suit.
---
I thought it was gonna be the reward for the burrows
---
&gt; Also stay out of party that way you can yell at other people area chat. 
---
Hah. Whatever you say, troll.
---
You're a douche, that takes this shit way too seriously. Once your testicles drop, and you get a job, you'll realize why acting like this makes you a dickbag. Nobody needs some falsetto voiced kid yelling at them, telling them how to enjoy what small amount of free time they have.
---
Yeah, reading comprehension is hard, I know you‚Äôre struggling but do try to keep up.
---
‚ÄúPlay another game‚Äù is EXACTLY what I‚Äôm told every time I complain about getting my shit wrecked by asshole griefers, right after I‚Äôm told there‚Äôs no such thing as griefing in this game.  
---
I‚Äôll allow it.
---
Thanks I appreciate it !
---
Well +1 to that for sure.
---
THIS! YES! This changes the how we should look at the reflecting perk. I was told it was pointless, but if the Impostor does enough damage to ohko people and reflecting 50% is visible damage, then it's not a useless perk.
---
Well...you see...that doesn't bring in new players...nor makes old players come back. Hyping it up the way they did probably made them more money this time around
---
Copper ore on the ridge across from Harper Ferry. Cross river at train tracks follow stairs all the way up.
---
Pick up lamps, cooking pots, lightbulbs, fuses
---
It might
---
Can anyone confirm that the assultron was the be all end all the burrows? If so that was severely underwhelming...
---
Not really, Bethesda made a deal to point out that the "Dungeon" would take a team of people to take it on. &lt;50 are soloing it. People are pissed because they promised a dungeon and gave a new location.
---
I had a concrete camp,  and griefers destroyed it. I rebuilt with steel.
---
at least someone knows how to have fun here.
---
Barely a delve...
---
Now you say that I could see flash bangs just being cheap and pissing people off haha
---
It sounds like you should be doing the Burrows on the Survival server
---
added you
---
Mama Murphy approves.
---
What‚Äôs your PS4 gamer tag
---
As others have said, you'll never be able to do maximum damage. I once considered making a character with 8 in all stats, but I found that I just wasn't going to be able to do anything good. I would be able to survive and quality of life would be great, but I would pack no punch. But if you do try it I would suggest doing unarmed since it only requires one perk card and can still do some decent damage.
---
There is a que to join your world, so I will wait in the que and come and find you when I get in.
---
I was able to run around the damn thing smacking it then blocking for a noticeable amount of time before it got me. Lol. 
---
I've yet to test if it works for ballistic damage. If it does, it might be decent for PvP too.
---
People read what they want to see, not what is written.  It was never a raid, it was not touted as end-game content.
---
It is a blip, not even mentioned on the roadmap.  It's something tucked away in a corner, a little lore/quest location.  It was never going to be anything else.
---
People complained about the Sheepsquatch event being too hard (and it's already been soloed).  Now they're complaining about this being too easy.  I don't believe you can make this sub happy, no matter what you give them.
---
I haven't been in there yet (stupid employment commitments), but my *assumption* was that it would be a diversion, something that I might be able to do myself or with a rando or two.  Run it once or twice, then move on.  
---
I doubt I'll be terribly disappointed, but I keep my expectations in check, and loosely based on reality.  That's a lost art.
---
I completely agree with you ! but you know how this industry has been going on for months now. Low cost games, strong micro transactions schemes. Investors want to see short term revenue sadly
---
I won't. The "play another game" bullshit is what got us here. And yes there are griefers, but if you're constantly running into them on adventure mode, figure out what it is you're doing wrong, because I don't have that issue, nor does anyone I play with.
---
You're and your have to be about the most simple words to grasp the difference between. You can't take 2 minutes of your time to increase your knowledge and better yourself?
---
Yes but the game came out last year in november. So i would guess nearly everyone who still plays the game after 5-6 Months should be around lv 100-300. If you keep that in mind every content update, this game offered you, like the brewing stuff, or the sheepsquatsh quests or whatever is a joke to at least 90% of all active players. Why should i spend 2k for doing the sheepsquatsh, to get an animal Head for my Hood. This is ridiculous. And what do they suggest us to do now? Wait until the next 10 minute Quest releases in a few weeks? And then? Wait another 3 months for real content? A backpack is no content that is one gear part. A legendary vendor is useless, when you've reached that point, where Caps are useless for you. And even if not i dont see a point in coming online just to farm Whitespring again just to get some caps i dont know how to spend anymore. I don't know man but bethesda makes everything worse and worse. I really begin to think that there are only really really stupid people working there. They don't know anything about how to make a progressive game at least.
---
no, open new one, I'll join you (need to reset world anyway)
---
&gt;The Burrows is balanced to be a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault Dwellers, but truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone.
---
Doesn't look like being bad at communicating to me.  Just flat out wrong.  Maybe naivety?  Maybe purposefully misleading?
---
&gt; The egg bleeds when punched tho,so who knows
---
Not to be shitty but half the non-blood filled things in this game bleed when you punch them. So the "who knows" is it's Bethesda's shitty engine working like it always has been.
---
Unless the "bleeding" is something different then what I've seen before, you can find wooden walls that bleed when you punch them.
---
You can kill charred ghouls with 3 shots of a pipe rifle. 
---
Basically anything that isn‚Äôt a super mob or a boss is easy to kill.
---
I got in as I sent the last message. Sorry about the hassle
---
Survival has nothing harder except bloodied builds one shotting everyone
---
Someone else is getting them. I have a large route I run trying to get a few more armor plans (marine armor/mods spawns at the same locations as marine UA)  I don't have, and they're consistently farmed across servers.
---
You have to hop between servers, and hope for the slim chance you get there between the last respawn, and the next hunter getting them.
---
I was going to make a mention of there proabably being other humans out there, presumably in cities that didn't get nuked, and that I was talking mostly about the Appalachia area, but my post was already long enough, and I figured somebody else would say something. But yeah, I kindda figured there's others out there, just not around Appalachia. I honestly didn't even take into account that the Scorch Beasts were flying around toasting everyone in their path, which considering all the charred remains still standing should have been my first clue, but I never claimed to be Mr. Obvious, LoL.
---
Nonetheless, that kindda further illustrates what I was saying about there being no humans and why only bots remain. Cause the Scorch Beasts killed damn near everyone (I'm sure a Deathclaw, as well as some other beasts along with the scorched, got a few kills in there too) as not all the dead bodies are charred remains.
---
Anyway, thanks for that bit of lore you added in. I always like learning more of the lore from the actual people who play the games. On that note, do you, or anybody, know of a site I can maybe check out to kindda read up on some of the Fallout lore and stories?
---
&gt; People read what they want to see, not what is written.
---
People read what Bethesda wrote.
---
Same here, it's very annoying because I recently got the X-01 jet pack.
---
Body is robot armor. head i don't know, you are probably right !
---
Thank you for sharing this
---
Having the spectre of players hunting you down or waiting for you in the Burrows' shadows would at least offer some level of difficulty/challenge/pain than what's currently in the vanilla Burrows experience.
---
I always have a black diamond on my character which adds +1 strength ..that adds 5+ carry weight..I also farm deathclaws..so deathclaw steaks add +10..they sometimes drop pocketed armor..as do yao guais
---
Felt exactly the same, got to the end and spent ages wondering around thinking I'd missed a secret door or something. Didn't even add anything unique...
---
How did you start the quest to get it?
---
The help screens shown during loading misleadingly say you need a "Locksmith Perk" to build locks for your CAMP items.  Not sure why they haven't removed this incorrect information from the lineup of loading screen pop ups.
---
There's so much going on here. Estimating level 104 to reach all the perk levels. And there are always at least 3 options to pick from each level. What are you trying to do?
---
Well, it does say on the holotape in Helvetia that the robots choose when to hold it so it could be redone any time. I also thought after the event had finished the bots could have been made a random encounter. Would be funny to find the master of ceremonies wandering the wasteland playing that music.
---
pc :)
---
The first thing I said on entering it with my friends was "Wow this music's really good!"  
---
Sadly, it couldn't save the poor design. The Silos are more challenging than this...
---
Where did they hire these idiot programmers, did they get a discount or something?
---
And probably did not use any perk cards to increase damage.
---
This isn't either, so what are you talking about???
---
a few other commenters stated this, but it i'm pretty sure it was some hostile critters that slowly ate your base, not a player. in either case, a few turrets would have avoided that situation, as hostile players attacking turrets will always give you a notification and turrets shred critters
---
Please suggest more obviously needed shit for this fucking retarded game that Bethesda refuses to implement. You could list 20-50 things that would make the game infinitely better but this fuckcompany probably wont implement it or at least not for the next millennia.
---
I feel like when you make a video of yourself in your car secretly recording a girl and then proceed to fat shame her you are not a "great guy". Then he claims copyright infringement and strikes every video that mentions him negatively down, but doesn't he sell unlicensed Fallout merchandise? Idk, seems hypocritical.  
---
No he does not deserve hate specifically for liking 76, but... not who I would call great... just my opinion.
---
I wanted those ghouls to come swarming out of the pipes in a huge horde. Totally bummed.....
---
Have you ever played skyrim?
---
looks like you dont hear me - do you have black titannium? I'm out of it :(
---
I like to drop a bag with only the clown in it. Or if I have bounty, the only junk I'll carry is 1 clown. Ha, I hope it's just a little bit of a jab when they check it hoping for good loot.
---
And probably like 4K caps
---
You're completely missing the point. 76 is already getting long in the tooth, content wise, and people are rapidly pushing up against the wall of what would be considered fun at the endgame. If you can even call killing the same SBQ over and over again with a myriad of randoms who just faceroll the thing in a few minutes an endgame. 
---
So they have an opportunity to resolve this glaring issue with the game and what do they do? They hype up a "dungeon" which implies a series of challenges in a confined space with a serious challenge at the end for good loot.. to a cake walk, 15 minute (solo) red carpet through ghouls so squishy I was one shotting them  with the first power fist that dropped. Two level 30 players could probably do this ridiculous charade they are calling a "dungeon".
---
End of the day, call a spade a spade. F76 has some excellent content and I have really enjoyed the journey up to this point (level 130). But I am rapidly seeing how they neglected the endgame and forgot to scale this thing. Burrows is a colossal fuck up on their part, and they had better get some end game challenges that even skilled players enjoy, or risk losing customers. End of story.
---
Sorry, sound is off while I'm settling my little wastelander (baby) I will grab some mats
---
They add toilet paper to the game but we can't use toilets...
---
People don't even need to log in and test them to figure it out. I find it hard to believe that not ONE PERSON working in proximity to the dev team knows what the challenges are ahead of time. 
---
"Well, it looks like we have to postpone the camera." 
---
"Hey aren't the challenges about the camera this week? People won't be able to do them." 
---
"Oops, that's right. Let's make sure they get changed before the weekly reset." 
---
It's like.... HOW? WHY? Did they make the decision to postpone the camera at the literal last fucking second? I can't tell what's worse: this fuck up or the fact that I'm still surprised by it.
---
You're welcome.
---
This is it! There‚Äôs only one answer! The Sheepsquatch! The real Sheepsquatch
---
I was really hoping for a challenge, now I'm gonna have to start a fight with my wife. Thank you bethesda
---
You didn't charge me enough.
---
I am super grateful for your help, I would like to pay more, or are there any mats you need?
---
I‚Äôm drinking and I just laughed out loud at the bar.  Everyone is looking at me weird, but I‚Äôm gonna check my pip-boy and turn on Appalachia Radio!
---
Been looking for that one myself but I think I‚Äôm gonna stick with the optimized servos for the chest, that is whenever I can actually apply it üôÑ
---
An upgraded smoke grenade that uses green smoke and adds radiation to the area would be a good addition to this
---
I hate this "But it's free" bullshit excuse. Warframe is completely free to play, nothing paid at all, and has a solid 4 times more content then 76. So why can I expect more from a 60 dollar game?
---
Yes you can nuke it and yes, they apparently turn to glowing ones. However the spawn rate is not much better than Whitesprings so it's kind of pointless...
---
apparently if someone else has already unlocked the door it will not show as locked for you, so you just never see where you are supposed to use the key.
---
Quest is not repeatable, area spawns are.
---
I think you only do the event once, but you can go into the area multiple times and kill the stuff again.
---
You just go into the sewers and loot the BOS soldier down there
---
You on Xbox?
---
Fulfilling the obligation of "free DLC" until they make actual stuff and decide to charge you for it.
---
I think it's just a chance to spawn a lv50 version in the same location as the lv20 version.
---
Pc
---
Better than nothing..
---
I found daisy chaining events is a really good way.
---
Very interesting. I have never seen this encounter before... The quills are part of the new cryptid quests that got released (two of them).
---
Yeah same, thats called advertising the new content, not hyping it up, hyping it up is what this sub has been doing to it
---
Thanks for the answer!
---
sorry for that black titannium - I thoight I got more of it :) Thats why I charged you less, hope you're ok?
---
Wait are you just saying that or did it hint at something coming in a month? I might have missed it
---
Is the quest not repeatable at all, or a daily?
---
Man.. If it was a one off.. I'm even more sad.
---
Sooo, you write storyline for Destiny DLC's or what?  Very nice!
---
I mean its not like you paid for it, sooo.
---
At all. At least in it's current state.
---
Can I offer you more mats? I don't want to short change you because I really appreciate your help (I've wanted to get this gear together for months!).
---
Your base is amazing by the way, it's got a really good layout, but the signs help too!
---
What was DOCUMENTED was Bethesda's direct response that it was a fucking BUG and all of the effects were unintended.  Maybe get your head out of your own ass.  
---
&gt; There are three issues currently affecting Adrenal Reaction that we're looking to address:
---
* Adrenal Reaction's positive effects are not applied to the player if they had the mutation prior to Patch 6 release.
---
* Adrenal Reaction's damage bonus is dealing less damage than intended following Patch 6 release.
---
* Reapplying Adrenal Reaction after Patch 6 release can cause some of its effects to fail to display in the Pip-Boy if the player logs out/back in.
---
&gt;We're currently working toward fixes for the first two and hope to have them addressed with Patch 7. The third requires some additional investigation, but we're looking into that as well.
---
Min/maxing has always been about max damage numbers.  Not what I'm asking is it?  I'm asking for review on how I have it set up and see if it's a viable build.
---
Don't let your body blacken and turn into coal, I'm staying up here
---
Long time ago, yes.
---
Awesome.  Thank you for your insight.  It's very helpful.  I'm debating between a laser weapon using fusion cells or something like hunting rifle.
---
no, we're ok, enjoy:)
---
Thats a shame, tossed my gutter drop already, oh well I didn't need it weighing me down anyways.
---
I did. I Grinded Whitesprings Everyday with my Pals until we all Quit because of the tse Nerf ,like many other people did . Except the thing is I Never went around Griefing Like more then Half of this community does now . The Game back then was different,  now it's Just Garbage just like its player base
---
&gt; Have you not played MMOs before?
---
I haven't
---
Is it super easy?
---
What‚Äôd be cool is if you could automatically have all your games highlighted or grouped when sitting down.
---
I believe you can swivel the camera slightly when sitting. I have sat at a bench in Lewisville and grabbed a plastic plate to put in my stash.
---
Last time a challenge was bugged and couldn't be completed (pick flowers) not only did they leave it up all week and not fix it, they also made it a challenge the next week, too, still bugged.
---
I don‚Äôt watch walking dead. So I have no idea on who or what he is. But could it be the same actor doing the voice work?
---
Yes, that's what I figured, and why I asked if he/she could remember where the door was :) thanks though!
---
Ditto. Im wondering if its a rare drop form the event or area now. If not maybe added later?
---
Yeah I dont think they ever said this one would be instanced, people just... as usual, assumed and hyped themselves up for something that was never promised
---
I have personally made many requests for a weekly state of the game live stream like the division does.....this is one reason we need that.
---
What you don't seem to understand is that we all get the same daily challenges.  You also don't seem to understand that you don't need a camera to craft 10 healing items, kill 10 robots in Watoga or "Level up!"
---
Nothing extra, just checked.
---
I saw this the other day near a circle marked on the map for possible sheepsquatch location. Sadly someone pointed out that this happened from time to time and is just a bug
---
im surprised you can even make articulate sentences with all that Todd Howard dick in your mouth
---
It gave me some real Prey (2016 one) vibes
---
You're not missing anything
---
Wen-dig-o... I used to say Wendingo too... It's ok.
---
Exactly. You're a bit on the moon at this point.
---
What about the fact that wood armor, literally made of wood, does not scrap into wood?
---
I tend to play pretty late so we could team up, I also have a team of people that would welcome you with open arms. Ps4?
---
I had to buy a new account and start from scratch. I play a lot so it wasn't overly hard to catch up.
---
Yep. I kinda regret ever complaining about them.
---
What I mean is that all the levels 50s when I was playing Are now 100 + and They're all toxic because Everyine has Duped weapons and Gear so they think they're Hot Stuff when they're really Not it's just Sad .
---
Honestly not that I notices... Just ghould and robots. Then at the end two Assaultrons, a dominator and defender. If I gained anything from it I'd say it was the the very nicely detailed underground sanctuary, until they all turned or whatever into ghouls. I'm in now just farming materials. Quite a bit of shit to grab lol. I honestly think there is more to it, than just a little raid.. There was almost a throne room if you can call it that. Sorry about the spoiler.
---
HA! found you! :D
---
Easy livin' this ain't.
---
Fellow female wastelander here. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this. I‚Äôve been in similar situations and honestly, at this point, even if he came to his senses, I personally wouldn‚Äôt continue playing with him. You‚Äôve been totally straightforward with him and that‚Äôs all it should have taken for him to stop. 
---
You‚Äôre not responsible for his feelings - he clearly has shown no regard for yours. You deserve better teammates and a fun gaming experience. If your other teammates don‚Äôt understand, I‚Äôd ghost the whole bunch and never look back!
---
That was the first thing I thought of when I heard his tape. It's the same actor, talking in a regular tone instead of slurring his words with a slight robot filter over it
---
Try the cork board, top floor of the taxidermy
---
Is more going to be added in later? Wasn‚Äôt there supposed to be a Mirelurk Queen in the sewer? That‚Äôs what the video made me believe at least
---
Over-hyped and under-delivered. A great many of us were let down this day, friend.
---
Nope. 10-15 minutes and you're done. Now you can grind mobs there. 10/10 absolutly worth the hype
---
That is life dude, there are many things I'd like to have or do but can't because real life things take priority. Sure it sucks not getting it but I wouldn't expect the devs and playerbase to cater around my life so I can get it. What is your suggestion? To not have special/holiday events that reward unique and rare items? Or to make the items available all the time, for free? Thus making them not special? Its a cosmetic that doesn't alter the game mechanics in any *intended* way. Maybe im missing your point somewhere but this is pretty typical in a lot of games I've played with special events. I guess this is a good example of Loss Aversion.    
---
Anyways, what would be your suggestion to Bethesda for this predicament?
---
If you are talking about the deathclaw egg it‚Äôs in the shop. I also don‚Äôt know where the burrows are
---
10/10 won't do again
---
Spelled it wrong in the title, but right in the actual post. I'm halfway there.
---
Yes, it looks like telling us the wrong thing
---
I mean, even if it were just advertising, that is still pointing us in the direction that it would be at least a bit challenging. So whether it was not delivering on the hype or the advertising, I think it has fallen flat either way. I‚Äôm not saying that it needs to be insurmountable, but at least so that it warrants you thinking about your gear a bit
---
It makes driving super awkward, but also manly.
---
And Blades is a free mobile game with MTXs like 90% of free mobile games.
---
Egg is in the atom store, for the burrows go to Harper's ferry and find one of the two new manholes. One out front of the armory, the other outside the Northwest entrance. You'll see them pop up on your compass as a water drop in a circle.
---
If you have a decent gun and armor is a bit of a cake walk if I'm honest, although it was different and reminded me of the dungeon runs in skyrim, obviously in fallout style. Nice change though, I miss the metros from fallout 3.
---
Where in the Camp menu is it found?
---
It's a one time thing since it seems to lock some players out of the boss room once they complete it
---
Hi Five minion, you‚Äôve earned it! üëã
---
&gt; Now im disappointed and i havent even tried it yet
---
Surely, since you play FO76, you know to ignore what others are saying until you try it for yourself
---
I don‚Äôt know probably in misc or floor decorations
---
Well, I heard from the last patch‚Äôs datamine that it‚Äôs just disabled and won‚Äôt spawn, much like these two new quests. So I‚Äôd say what we really need is a dataminer to confirm if it‚Äôs active yet or still disabled. If it‚Äôs the latter, there probably will be a quest that culminates in its discovery.
---
At the moment my hunch is it‚Äôs going to have something to do with the new Arktos Pharma dungeon.
---
Other than glowing meat steaks not much in the way of boosting it.  I think my strength is normally at 17 and if it's day time I get +3 from solar powered.  I don't hit that hard.  I think when I look in the stats the dmg is around 250.  I have 1 rank of each slugger, I think rank 3 of martial artist and incisor, also run rank 1 of tenderizer and bloody mess.
---
How do you start the new quest?  I know how to start the Burrows but people have been mentioning a new Sheepsquatch quest.
---
I didn't have it for the longest time because I thought I didn't need it since I didn't care about the being able to run. But boy do I notice the difference. Being able to move as quickly as I want is nice and lets me going through areas quicker before I become in \[Danger\] and if things go sour I can sprint away a ways and then crouch and go back into \[Caution\] for my sneak attacks within 20 seconds. Since then I always include it.
---
If you don't see the death claw statue then somethings wrong. You see everything even if you don't own it :(
---
There's a cool down period for the last part, as it takes place as a public event. Also, at level 17, you're gonna have a hard time surviving it. Hopefully it doesn't crash on you during respawns as it has to many other players. Good luck :)
---
Ok thx
---
I cant find the holo taoe at southern belle? Can you help me with where I'm missing it?
---
I feel like this is an obviously good idea. Lets keep suggesting really good obviously great ideas that Bethesda will probably ignore......like perk card load outs, reconnecting to server you were just on or at least refunded resources spent at workshop you captured since you cant keep one for more than an hour or so without Bugthesda kicking you.
---
If it can‚Äôt be sold, dropped, or traded, why would you need to recreate it from a blueprint?
---
They sound pretty insufferable. They should all quit the game and play something else, stop bothering the elite dedicated TRUE Fallout fans on this sub, amirite?
---
Okay so its just that one mission where you go to the pump station and kill the robots and then that's it?
---
Healers and tanks min/max like crazy too.
---
Im blocking you and refusing to participate in any further interaction. You ain't a villain, just a self-righteous douche.
---
If you're still looking for the egg, it's under floor decor. Specifically, it's under the section with the power armor and deathclaw statues.
---
I would highly recommend just flipping around the Fallout Wikia. It‚Äôs a bit clinical, but jumping from article to article nets you a ton of really interesting information.  If you want to learn about the extend to which non-vault dwellers have succeeded in starting society once more, I‚Äôd start with the New California Republic, which is the largest and most successful governing body to come out of the ruins of civilization. It‚Äôs got running water, electricity, organized farms, and even a shitload of bureaucracy. Then just follow the hyperlinks to whatever catches your eye. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/New_California_Republic
---
Cant you just craft it?
---
I'm to lazy to get lead
---
Are you still excited?
---
I bet you dude doesn't even know wtf a good engine is.  He probably doesn't even play this game, sounds like a douche troll fer real.  "What's the engine matter" ask your car jackass!  There a difference!
---
I‚Äôve just done this.
---
Well I dont disagree that this needs to be fixed..but hopefully they work on some of the real game breaking bugs first.
---
But knowing Bethesda this will prolly be prioritized.
---
I'm done with you already.  Seriously.  Simple request was to get insight on a medic build (to which your response was there's no need for a build).  Enough with the back and forth crap.  If you have zero insight on the build, just move on.  I'm only interested in people that care about role playing.  When I move on to making a crowd control tank, I'll make sure not to have any input from you.
---
If you find it, let me know.
---
Most likely.
---
I'm heavily dominating in PvP. You are not. You sure you are the right person to talk balance with me? I'm afraid you are suggesting that freefrags should be nerfed hence I already know the answer.
---
Todd Howard: ‚ÄúIt just works.‚Äù
---
There's no holotape there. It's a piece of paper. If you look at where the police protectron is and then turn to the left, you'll see some patio tables, and the paper is on one of them.
---
Yeah, I just re-read the into the vault article on it and have to admit that all of the hype (and following disappointment) came purely from this subreddit. We got exactly what was promised, and it's not even that bad. I got a good haul of legendaries, including a 3* bloodied handmade. Nothing to complain about except that the 2* legendary assaultron at the end didn't drop a legendary
---
Skeleton crew, probably.
---
&gt;I took a sick day for this.
---
The indoors are affected by Nukes. Just tried on the Burrows. And you don t even get radiations there
---
They guarantee spawn at costume store.
---
Dude! You need to eat something.... LOL
---
Thank you so much
---
10/10 I really hope u a joking.
---
This needs to happen.
---
Just tried and if effects the Burrows
---
I absolutely do. 97% of what i read on Reddit is complaining, 2.99% people looking for/giving advice, and .01% or less people praising the game. Im still enjoying the game, and theres so much more coming.
---
They spawn multiple places each session, just sell them to a vendor
---
I know, I more meant this for lower levels because it's kind of a pain in the ass to get out there when you're below level 20?
---
Bethesda should hire you
---
There has to be more to it then just going thru and getting the gutter, right?
---
I'll check it out next time I'm on, thanks.
---
I was going to but they don't sell for very much at all so I figure if someone who just started playing wants one, they can have it
---
No it wasn't, it sucked like the rest of it!!           Not really, I was just trying to make this post be like all the other ones with "Burrows" in the title.  Glad you found something positive.  Thumb up!
---
Is there a stuffed beaver?  I need to make that Naked Gun reference!
---
Just went through solo, killed 12-15 legendaries and got about 9\* and 2-7 2\*
---
Alright, can you answer the question then?
---
yeah i had 2 lvl2 heavy machine gun turrets, and for the entire time ive been there the turrets took care of all problems, i only ever had a few crops destroyed before, so that is why i figured it was players as my entire camp was demolished,not just a few crops
---
Dude, it‚Äôs free content. You‚Äôre not owed anything.
---
Berry mentats do work to simply reveal (roughly) where an enemy is. Only issue is, if someone maintains a stash of stealthboys, you must either maintain a supply as well of either stealthboys or BMs. 
---
A perk that allowed you to vats camo‚Äôd enemies would go a long way
---
I  spent 10 minutes doing the mission then another 30 trying to figure out if their is more content. 10 minutes.... I guess
---
I don't have a comment on the rest, but as to the rad sponge, you won't be able to team up with the bloodied characters if it's on. So, maybe have another option for those three points or specifically stay away from teams with bloodied characters.
---
I'm pretty sure most people bought the game, so yes WE paid for it, did you pirate the game somehow?  There is no such thing as FREE DLC, companies don't give things away, thats just a marketing term.
---
I also repaired it all for nothing when it was completely unnecessary.
---
try it, because i have been placing down things and putting them on rugs with no problems, like the brahmin pen, just did that yesterday. i love having everything inside!
---
The downvote faires are out in force here, everyone's points dropped.
---
Thats why I think the game would benifit from item to item trading as well as caps trading. The armor I have, 25k in caps would be one piece lol
---
Totally agree. Attacking while invisible is just bogus. They should be stealth tools, maybe escape tools, but definitely not offensive tools
---
I think realistically this is more to do with using the word Dungeon. I think Bethesda uses it more to refer to any kind of interior location you explore. Other games use Dungeon to mean a huge sprawling underground environment with multiple enemies and bosses. I think Vault Raids are going to be what everyone was expecting this to be.
---
I will say it's still disappointing for a new place to be given it's own special release, only to end up being a basic interior cell.
---
heh. i'm sure it'll be broken forever, but I figured in theory this one should be as simple as changing the file from the wrong picture to the right one and clicking enter.
---
K, you've completely missed the point of what I said, way to go dumbass
---
Wasnt a pc player using robot armor and a lever action was it? I dod just that after waiting 5 minutes for the guy to catch up before i got called away to go downstairs so i assumed the guy wearing enclave uniform walked off so finished the run without him
---
This ‚Äúdungeon‚Äù has actually made me mad. Been looking forward to it since the announcement. And now I just feel ill.
---
Just say it was a hyperbole and move on, my dude.
---
Everyone stopped talking about the fact that 4 of the masks were never obtained by anyone.
---
Good point.  There's actually 2 in the group that run bloodied.  I can swap that our for Tenderizer or Suppressor.  Thanks for the input.
---
How is repairing items p2w?
---
They can walk through locked doors too lol. The worst (and funniest) thing like this that ever happened to me was when a deathclaw managed to glitch it‚Äôs way through my camp wall and I had to fight it in my bedroom.  üòÇ
---
No not the same actor, but probably a reference/nod.
---
Would you like to file a butthurt report?
---
Why are you comparing this to a mobile game?
---
I get the feeling they pushed back more content than they said!
---
Please stop lying, we all know that just isn't true
---
Go on and smash your hype.
---
Gonna name him Michael Jackson now? Started off black then ended up white?
---
Where is burrows
---
There are two. The one I mentioned in this post is started by finding a holotape by the bed at Toxic Larry's. The second by picking up a note on a table out front of the Southern Belle Motel. :)
---
When I just responded to one? Makes no sense.
---
Definitely based of negean in my opinion. As soon as I heard that holo that‚Äôs the first thought of.
---
Lol no, I‚Äôm lucky to have any back up whatsoever. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty proficient in PvP and I‚Äôve been around so I have no doubts that a good build using stealthboys could just wreck that many people. 
---
I‚Äôm not one to hugely harp on the balance of this game, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too too bad (definite tweaks needed) but stealthboys are just so aggravating. It takes literally nothing for an opponent to make it significantly more difficult for you other than just possessing it, there is no true counter to stealthboys either. 
---
Berry Mentats May make you glow, but it‚Äôs not really a counter is it? It barely resets the scales. I‚Äôm of the opinion that they should be brought in line with the rest of the RPG game and have a proper counter
---
Toxic Larry's Meat N Go
---
Mounted Mothman got a little shriek outta me. Didn't expect them to literally just stick his entire full-size model on a wall plate
---
Open now
---
Alternatively; must*‚Äôve*
---
No; they should disengage when you attack. That would make the items much more balanced. Not a glitch report post but I appreciate you being here!
---
K I guess what I mean is 'they don't make any money off this addition so what did you expect.'
---
I like to think that they have one person working on drip feed content to keep the community‚Äôs ravenous appetite sated while the majority of the crew works on large content drops for future release.
---
Damn, you make this sound amazing.
---
You need to fix your Fallout76Custom.ini so that it loads the new asset files for the most recent update.  
---
Find the line "sResourceArchive2List=" in Fallout76.ini and copy everything following to the same line in Fallout76Custom.ini, replacing everything except for whatever mods you are running at the end.
---
Seriously this is bad
---
Yes you can reset your special stats after level 50 each time you level up.
---
As for new content the only thing worth mentioning is the new sheepsquatch quests, bit short but I found it enjoyable.
---
The first "dungeon" also dropped today but it took about 5 minutes to complete. It might be more challenging if your still pretty low level.
---
This would be really cool! Or at least some sort of debuff when they activate. 
---
The way the game stands right now is; you use them, otherwise you‚Äôre at a severe disadvantage
---
What are you trying to do? There are multiple perks that don't work well together such as multiple weapon dmg boosting perks. It's hard to know what you want to specialize in.
---
Did you miss the 500 posts today?
---
Its hilarious to see people whom probably havent worked on a program, let alone a game in their life discuss engines.  
---
New is not necessarily better, an engine is a very open ended framework when all is said and done (unless you're stuck with frostbite apparently)  
---
The one thing you should be complaining about is their lack of proper unit testing and QA... I honestly think they have no test team and/or procedures for testing and validating changes in place at all, given the issues they let slip into patches.  
---
That is coming from a software tester, if a dev in my company adds a new button to a screen, or a new column to a report, he sends the work item to me for validation AFTER the unit tests pass on his build, then I manually verify that its working as intended, and I test all features related to the screen or to a report before I validate it as done.  
---
If I run into a problem, I call the dev over and let him see what isnt working as intended, and he has to stop whatever he's doing and fix his shit first for another round of testing.  
---
That last bit isnt possible everywhere due to strict planning schedules and storypoint quota's and whatnot, but you get the gist: The things they break in patches just show they do not test them at all, or the person they hired to test it is doing jack shit and isnt being noticed as slacking off.
---
If only every commenter was like you!
---
I screwed up and asked for some source on Fallout lore over on the main sub and was downvoted into oblivion, being downvoted for asking a simple question is the way of reddit.
---
did you check your workshop stored items? is it possible that your base was stored in pieces there? i experienced that more than a few times in the past, though it was supposedly fixed
---
I'm simply worried that they've pushed back so much already. Vendors, cameras, and zero mention of being able to place objects in our camps. I'm loving these side quests so far, but the whole situation just doesn't sit right for me.
---
I thought so but I haven't seen anything in game or out that says so. The 'boss' was so bad, just looked at it and it disintegrated. Could have at least added a custom version if not a new enemy. I've always wanted to see the old school sentry bots bought into 3d, the 4 wheeled tank varients.
---
"Someone \*gave\* me 9812312837127312 ultracite missiles!"
---
Its not meta, thats the point. It was meta only against noob enemies in slap damage world. I already answered that. You are full of anger towards the armor that you feel is unjust, but this armor is very hard to apply successfully against an enemy that knows what they are doing. I already said that. You ask me to repeat the answers I already gave because they are so incompatible with your worldview that you dismiss them instantly. But its the truth. Sentinel armor doesn't need any nerf because against non-idiot players its only applicable across extreme distances, distances so big that you need your team to be your eyes.
---
I'm with her. RIP the bandaid off and protect your valuable time. Inform the other two that there's a problem, but in this case you can't solve it in a nice tidy package that spares everyone's feelings. Not your fault, but sadly you might feel like you're being the bad guy. Its 2019 though not 2009 so I think the rest of your squad will figure it out. Best of luck+stay safe and happy.
---
Do you give spoilers much asshat? Oh look at me I already done new content time for spoilers.  I didn‚Äôt read it all but ffs
---
That‚Äôs not reddit lol that‚Äôs the players who aren‚Äôt on reddit.
---
Most people on here are not casual.
---
That‚Äôs why unyielding sentinel etc goes for more caps than you can actually have on your character.
---
put it this way, I'm glad that it's a free update.  totally underwhelming and not what we, the player base, deserves.
---
on a side note, anyone know yet what we do with the gutshrooms?
---
Yes they said there was no patch today
---
Definitely
---
I would like to think that as well...
---
First off a dungeon needs to be a dungeon. Not a quest in the sewers.
---
Yes, definitely difficult, will see how I go about it.
---
Bruh, its ok, just stop playing the game. That fuckin thing is designed to suck out all of the precious remaining time we have left.
---
Really really bits and pieces.
---
I must be fucking stupid, but I cant even figure out the password for Scoots terminal...
---
My first run, I encountered three legendaries, two 1\* and one 3\*. Of course they all dropped 1\* leather armor. At least its consistent.
---
That‚Äôs damn good my boy 
---
I want to complete that
---
I am pretty sure this was content that was cut from initial release due to it not being fully developed. Some marketing guy and project manager sold it to the higher ups as "hey, we can release this as "free" content later on"....
---
be level 50 withok wepason and it should be fine, if you can kill the ghouls at whitesprings no problem its about that hard
---
Ma Ri 11 17 :)
---
I don‚Äôt know what ya‚Äôll are talking about, I modded all of my armor and all of Weapons today. No problem. I very rarely suffer from these problem you lot rave about. Maybe I‚Äôm lucky? Maybe you‚Äôre all whiny bitches? Who knows the truth!?
---
Pedo Tyrone
---
I tried this first with my 197 melee character went through it all with my pickaxe and had no difficulty. I tried it again with my level 109 using my handmade and again no difficulty. I saw a level 19 go through with a pipe pistol and didn't appear to have any trouble with killing the stuff in there. THis dungeon if you want to call it that doesn't require 50+ let a lone 2 50+ players. It's a joke.
---
It's quite small so many people did it already.
---
No. Almost never.
---
That‚Äôs a surprise
---
Eventually u will get to a point where u just have tons of lvl ups pending.
---
Then why are you butthurt when other people think you are a creepy little goblin?
---
they should have added some behemoths or atleast increased the number of ghouls. and gave them a better chance of being 3\* Legendaries
---
I also highly recommend doing That Sinking Feeling at night for ambiance
---
Keep repeating Encryptid event. I got another one last night.
---
Go design your own game then. Oh, that‚Äôs right, you can‚Äôt.
---
Thanks, I knew it was Mari but where the hell do you get the numbers from?
---
I believe that's Arkos (sp?) Labs, which is a separate dungeon from this one. If I had to guess that one is a bigger tougher one, but I am only speculating about that.
---
Obviously they're registered personnel.
---
Pay it forward when you can.  Whenever I see someone near a stash box I ask them what kind of ammo they use and dump all of it on them, 9/10 times the person will return the favor, it's the best way to get ammo IMHO.  Stockpiling known plans and recipes is nice as well.
---
Howcome?
---
Yep the only thing you could have added to the body of the post was ‚Äòcheck‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-fuckinmate‚Äô
---
This is true, I think everyone expected a bit more out of it with the way Bethesda advertised it to us.
---
I could have still found enjoyment out if it, were it not for the two things I mentioned.
---
Exploring it is painful without a map, and having to rush through to keep up with whoever comes in after you just shortens the experience
---
Will if I find out, fellow Enclave member.
---
How soon u will kill him?
---
I get vending... They don't want to add new dupe glitches but I'm kinda wondering why push back cameras lol
---
Had some follow me up to the fourth floor of fort defiance once. I was like "dayum j-49 you got ALL them forms filled out? I bet you Googled where to get a piece of mail. "
---
I'll throw in my vote for stealth commando. I made a new character just to redo my perks and it's made a HUGE improvement. I don't fear anything as a level 50. Even after level 22 when I had rank 3 sneak and a fully decked out combat rifle I was doing hard damage before I could use handmade rifles.
---
I could kill it fast af no prob I‚Äôll join
---
I was really hoping they'd just keep digging deeper, seems like they actually believed that each person got a unique set of challenges and they could just bullshit their way through insisting that theirs were all camera based.
---
The camera isn‚Äôt in the game yet , there is a daily challenge but it isn‚Äôt supposed to be there.
---
No point in fixing it?! I'd like to not have the amount of atoms we can play for get even less per day and week. I'd say there is a point to fixing it!
---
Just look at the arrows all over the place. They literally point in the direction to go. üôà
---
At least be able to drink beer and shoot from my rocking chair on my porch. It IS West Virginia after all
---
It's not been released yet
---
They also don't give any glowing mass/hardened mass.
---
Mari's birthday according to the terminal :)
---
You responded to a joke, being butthurt about a joke makes a lot of sense if you are one of those ‚Äútrue elite and dedicated fans‚Äù
---
This is reddit, you expect logic over emotion?
---
You didn't get robbed you were just stupid to give him the stuff without setting a price I would asking do that if you don't set a price for stuff 
---
Next time put a price on the thing
---
X-01 rad resistance is highest.
---
What‚Äôs the point in this post
---
How many of the environmental assets are completely new? I haven‚Äôt played yet
---
Cranberrys. They're good at more than treating UTIs.
---
Well, to be fair, it's not more doable than the radstorm challenge. But the radstorm challenge is only a hair more doable than it.
---
By deluxe edition you mean tricentennial right? If that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôd say to just buy the regular version, unless you‚Äôre interested in the skins and posters you get
---
I absolutely love the random encounter idea.
---
We need challanges but we need a worth while payout for them as well. I have done the sheepsquash event over 15 times and have 14 fedoras and a mascot head, and a 1 star pipe and 1 star wooden armor...
---
Last 5 times I have tried the queen she has flown out of the map before the time was up, 3 times she stopped taking damage all together and the last time she didnt land, not once
---
up, SB4ND0L4F no mic
---
There are normal location way NICER than those sewers. Talking about lore content.
---
I‚Äôm not going to do this with you. 
---
Go outside and get some sunshine. Peace.
---
Playing the wrong game, obviously.  :)
---
I know that feel bro
---
Same here my boy same here
---
Yep lmao
---
I like the way you think man! If you're on xbox you should give me your gt so we can grind some together sometime
---
cool. No one cares
---
Do your parents know you're on Reddit, young man?
---
My wife has a Cameo 3 which cuts vinyl that you can heat press to make shirts if I get around to cutting one up I‚Äôll let you know to send you an extra cut
---
Add me, rickpenna 
---
I‚Äôm doing the quest
---
Bethesda needs to start doing hotfixes. We can't wait literal weeks at a time to have a basic function of the game get fixed. This isn't something negligible like bobby pin weight that be relatively easy to ignore. This is a rather important part of the game that isn't functional.
---
Given that they weren't fixed today, we're looking at 2 weeks minimum of them not functioning at all because of the Tuesday only schedule that seems to be the norm.
---
You will find a note on a table at the front of ''Southern Bell Motel'' which will start a short quest called 'That sinking feeling' where you will get the plans as reward for completion.
---
Some sort of anger at not having to wait for a patch download or server maintenance to complete. I think?
---
Are you sure? According to this none are released yet...
---

Wasn't aware of this link at the time of posting.
---
Dont forget the weekly too. üòÇüòÇ
---
Heck, the one for 4 doesn't even work for me for some reason anymore.
---
You gonna see how great your brothers are.
---
There's 2 entrances next to "Harper's Ferry".
---
I was going to wait and do sheepsquash much later when everyone had lost interest until I notice the end battle was not really a solo thing
---
 The Heavy Combat Armor with the BoS mods is the best armor in the game. The blurb about Marine Combat armor that appears on your screen, well used to, is a lie. ;)
---
I just want to add that I too would pay a subscription for premium fallout content. This feels like a wasted opportunity in such a big way.
---
If you paid by caps it should be in the thousands per point
---
Okay so maybe you didn't read my post, I had no trouble getting the quest done. There are arrows pointing you how to get to the central chamber, I know that.
---
It's exploring the rest of the place that is painful. I wanted to 100% clear every room, loot and enemies, but without having a clear way to learn the layout of all the rooms and pathways, o just kept going in circles.
---
So for 2 fresh level 50's, it might be a challenging event.  For a well-geared veteran with pimped out gear, it will be soloable.  How does that compare to what is actually there?
---
They r red.
---
All the stuff I saw people thought, thought it was going to be in the forest.
---
Because it was boring AF to get there.
---
That sounds totally plausible here
---
I'm not talking about what level a player is, but what type of gamer they are. The players here on this sub are not run-of-the-mill players, and they represent a very small fraction of the people playing the game. After all, these are people that think about this game enough to be on these boards discussing tactics for the various events and helping each other tune their builds. Out in the wild I'm lucky to find a random that realizes you need to put the soy chunks in the hopper.
---
The players here are generally better than the average player, or at least have directed their grind to a more unified build than just randomly picking what looks coolest from the perk cards. You are going to be beyond the content they are introducing because this content is targeted at the larger demographic. And it will continue to be targeted at them since they are the ones that will keep the bills paid. The better players are inventing their own challenges, just like they do in every other online game - battle the length of Appalachia naked and drunk on moonshine, create carnival attractions out of their camps, kills the queen with nothing but a rolling pin, etc. Yes, we are bored. And yes, we need more end-game content. But even the upcoming raids will be solo material for the type of gamer on this sub or they would be too difficult for the majority of the players.
---
What would you say a good level threshold to go through
---
Exactly. 
---
You can favourite armour but then it shows up on your wheel.
---
I would also say that if it was repeatable that u could look for them next time. But really no point since there is 0 reason to go back.
---
Interesting situation if that's the case, I'll check that out when I decide to head over (after the crowds die down most likely).
---
Look at the [community patch notes](https://despotak.github.io/fallout_76_patch_notes/v1.0.6.0.html#spell).
---
Here's the [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/asps77/fallout_76_v_1060_changelog_based_on_game_data/) about it.
---
BGS borked Adrenal Reaction, **when they made the stealth nerf**.
---
It's really easy, only ghouls and some robots nothing special that you need to worry about.  
---
50+ enemies though so i guess you better be at that point 50+.
---
lol what a ridiculous nit to pick about this game.
---
 Two shot, basically shoots two bullets each time you pull the trigger (just consumes 1 ammunition though). The second bullet supossedly does 25% base weapon damage, which I understand implies no damage increasing perks are taken into account for this second bullet. 
---
 I think that mutant's damage increase is basically like a perk's damage increase. For assassin, I don't know, because it could be applied before or after the other player's damage reduction.
---
 Reflect damage while blocking I don't think reduces damage more than a block with an identical weapon but that doesn't have that modifier. I think it blocks the same damage but reflects 50% of the enemy's damage before your DR. 
---
 Furious I think stacks up to x1.5 adding x1.05 for each hit. Explosive weapons I believe create an explosion on impact, which does area of effect damage for 20% of the weapon's base damage. I think the damage increase of demolitionist perk works with this explosion's damage. 
---
 Hope I clarified something (and that I am not missinformating you)!
---
No. I got it, and I never use it. The only thing that might be cool is the weapon paint. Unless you're a collector, it's just cosmetic stuff you probably will never wear.
---
Nuked the area a few mins ago. In one run I got 4 ledgendary glowing ones. 2 of them were 3 star. Similar results in following runs with people on my discord. Seems like okay farming but I'm not sure if I would say better than whitesprings.
---
 I keep waiting for him to call one if the Burrows Boys Justin
---
ok
---
See, the trouble is that radstorm one gives you that glimmer of hope that just maybe you'll find one. But you don't. At least these don't torment you.
---
What do you mean but hurt? I ‚Äúam‚Äù a creepy lil goblin.
---
It would have been fun to have tons of ghouls come running in. Multiple waves.
---
A quest that was kind of lulling us into a false sense of security.....then boom ghouls everywhere.
---
Ten minutes in lucky hole mines in excavator armor will get you enough lead for a week at least
---
On Xbox an hour ago I was the only one
---
You are definitely not missing out but you should be able to get inside again
---
Just a way out of the room
---
They sold the game stating that future content would be included with the base game price.
---
So its not free, it was 60$
---
I think its really stupid to defend a company for putting out less then mediocre stuff just because it's "free"
---
You try and put a box mod that you pick up in world or buy on anything in game lately if you don't already know how to craft said mod too? Thought not. So why post on something you didn't bother actually reading any posts about?
---
Sounds sick but...what if you fail?
---
I care about role playing, I really do. Roleplaying has zero interaction with coming up with a perk build.
---
You are asking if it works, have you tried it? Most people are not playing medics because they are not necessary for anything in this game and are going to have little feedback. It sucks dude but its true.
---
No need to be hostile friend.
---
Thanks I will check this out
---
Ok, lol says I got 17 hours to caft camera film and to mod a len
---
The terminal to open the door into the pump station is missing the option to release the mag lock.
---
No probs. Good to hear.
---
You need to walk to the valve again and turn it then you can open the door again
---
Just look them up. Someone posts them every week here
---
Oh man look at all the shills coming out of the woodwork
---
Nah, love the game but that tricentennial edition is a waste of funds.
---
*wipes brow*. Thought I was SOL. Thank you.
---
I‚Äôll try that.
---
no need so long you're about level 50 it's easy peasy
---
IS this worth 5k though? Doesn't look so good to me.
---
I am on Xbox
---
It should work if it doesn‚Äôt let me know.
---
oh was looking for a challenge, lvl 71
---
Yeah, volume would have helped. Like a mines of moria scenario. But they needed to preface it, have story's peppered throughout mentioning missing people, strange noises ect that gradually builds the threat. Use environmental design to show broken barricades and last stands, or gore pits where gouls had dragged victims to eat.
---
Again, I dislike gouls as thier choice of enemy. Supermutants would have worked better imo
---
I killed the "boss" and was like "..is this it...really?...?"
---
Lots people on the east coast are just getting home (work, school, whatever).  I'd expect it to be fairly quite up until now, but by the time I get going here in another hour or so, I'd assume things will be ramping up quite a bit.
---
So it‚Äôs just a mod for the combat armor?
---
Alright
---
You‚Äôre welcome
---
ü§£
---
That'd be a shitty situation
---
Edit the title
---
like all the people that go on reddit and post how easy it was.
---
And really it is. So long your build isn't totally garbage and you take good care of the anti armor gutsys
---
The silos are pretty hard though, the endless turrets and Assaultrons do my absolute head in
---
Neither constructive nor funny here player.
---
My aim was comedy, and I‚Äôm speaking from personal experience. Yours might be different. Also, unyielding sentinel goes for about 20k on LFG.
---
‚Äú Now Available: The Burrows 
---
Will you survive this new subterranean challenge?
---
Grab your gear, a trusty teammate, and decent into The Burrows by accessing sewer manhole covers in Harpers Ferry ‚Äù
---
Right...
---
I went today and happened upon it relatively untouched, and it was... better. Nothing horrifying to deal with as a solo player, but close enough that I had to stim and take cover a couple times.
---
As a person who relies on dailies for their Atoms, this is very disappointing. Out of the 5 we get today, that means I am unable to do 2 possibly 3 of them. Very disappointing.
---
I dunno, advertising always has to make things sounds better than they are, not gonna find an advert saying "try our milkshakes, they're not great and a little overpriced, but they're here" its gonna say "our milkshakes are the best in town!" Even when they blatantly arent, or maybe they are, to a few people, like we know that the devs dont play fo76 as much as a lot of us crazy redditors do, so to them "the casual gamer" maybe it is a hard dungeon requiring 2 level 50's?  
---
End of the day they will see this feedback and the actual properly advertised end game dungeons should hopefully be death haven hell holes that we can all cry over for being too difficult to complete and the solo players can moan because its they're impossible solo.  
---
I think in terms of dungeons they should add in different difficulty ones, so this would be beginner, then up the difficulty each and every dungeon they do
---
We all whoosh from time to time.
---
Don't even bother arguing they're probably all Bethesda employees rubbin each other and down voting reddit posts that point out game issues.
---
Thank you. This fixed it
---
Normal harpers ferry is way harder
---
Not if you exclusively drive stand-up jet ski's.
---
so what‚Äôs the last quest called or what do you do because i‚Äôm not 100 percent sure i‚Äôm done and at the event part
---
I wish Bethesda would put a griefer count on those who wreck/damage a camp in the adventure mode, if the count reaches 3 in a week a cloud would descend and a pair of large menacing hands would rip the offender in to tiny shreds, the offender would be blocked out of the adventure side for 1 month first offense, and be auto transported to the PVP world, Survival.
---
If they keep at afterwards then permanent ban.
---
Just my 2 cents...
---
 sleep to get well rested 5% bonus also check your recipes cranberry cobbler gives extra 5% for a half hour cranberry relish gives 10% bonus for 1 hour.
---
The Burrows was not made with sneak snipers in mind ... I got hit once, because I was picking a door lock and not paying attention. 
---
Lvl 109, Shrouded Wood armor, TS Lever Action
---
Now if this place could be Nuked, people would forget White Spring ever farmed because the Ghoul Spawn rate is very high. I encountered two 3*, one 2* and I think one or two 1*s. No one else was in the Burrows with me or if they were they weren't close.
---
I thought that I needed the perks for that. Thanks
---
No, you can find plans for them in the world. All RNG, and no longer at vendors.
---
There are several locations they have a higher chance of spawning, but they're all heavily farmed.
---
Why is "Free" in quotation marks?
---
As much as I generally don't like the mechanic, sit should be a hold button action.
---
Now
---
I love this game, but this bug is the biggest pile of steaming terd.
---
Sounds awesome, more like a raid though. I'd be psyched if the raids turn out like this.
---
I dont need the individual pieces?
---
Lolol I think calling it a 2-4 player dungeon instead  a new location to explore caused some misunderstanding! But your right lol I ran it twice and I like the location now we need to nuke it! Could be the new white springs!
---

i have an explosive and its the most broken weapon i have atm. it does the damage of an explosive pump but you can rapid fire it.

Nope

Starting NOW!

Please tell me the special surprise is my own pet baby Deathclaw!
---
Went in, mopped up some ghouls, wandered around for a bit, got fucking bored and alt-F4'd.

Fail.
---
depends, do you want your rads gone in 2 mins, or 5 mins
---
&gt;!exact times may vary, depending on use.!&lt;
---
Lay prone should be an action with recoil/accuracy buff
---
This comment is a glaring example of bad this sub has gotten. I don't have problems so anyone that does must be a whiney bitch. There are hundreds of videos on youtube showing the many issues people have complained about, get over yourself
---
Actually a pretty good idea for all the whiners out there. Of course it‚Äôs easy, you have 400 hours worth of gear!
---
I'm hoping something comes out one of them too üòÇ
---
No, as long as you have a keycard you can just run the silo and look up the codes when it‚Äôs time to punch them in. Luckily I learned this after only 2 silos.
---
&gt;Last week: Sheepsquatch is to hard, one shots aren‚Äôt fun, I can‚Äôt do it solo, trash rewards, not worth using the stimpacks 
---
&gt;
---
&gt;This week: this burrow was supposed to be a 1-2 hour experiance that my level 425 should die 15 times MINIMUM inside. And definelty walk out with multiple 3 Star weapons that should be guaranted god rolls 
---
&gt;Like seriously can we calm down and farm the area for a few days before blowing the collective we all hate Bethesda load
---
I think that‚Äôs fair. I mean it‚Äôs not a bad first run, just wasn‚Äôt quite what I had been expecting. I‚Äôm a pretty casual level 60 and it wasn‚Äôt terrible for me. Final boss took me a little bit which was nice, but beyond that it wasn‚Äôt too bad. I would definitely like the increasing dungeons. If this is like a first go, I think that is fine. I was still able to get like 4 legendaries on a run, so not terrible loot wise for the difficulty.
---
I find it difficult to find players under lv100 anymore. I dunno who the fuck they thought they were making this for.
---
 U h o h
---
IRL I instinctively take my phone out and hide it before I find a chair to sit down in so nobody bothers me with their bullshit while I'm trying to relax... but since nobody's figured out how to bother me via my Pip-boy yet I'd enjoy the ability to use that while sitting.
---
I think people forget that we used to pay for a season pass and wed get 3-4 hours od DLC content once every 3 months or so. So to me the length of these drops isnt the issue. 
---
I personally think its dumb how they are doing it, because people do want more to sink their teeth into, and all of the parade, sheepsquatch, burrows, backpacks, scouts things could have made one great DLC drop together.... however my biggest issue is how much they break with each patch and that they dont make immediate or prompt hotfixes to integral breaks in the game itself.
---
Wow my friend and I have wasted a lot of time. Thank you for the help
---
Honestly, I don't play much other mp games so I don't know how normal it is, but I do play GTA V online and Rockstar does stuff like this a lot, so this is definitely not a first for a company doing this. Except GTA players don't complain about it, they try to get as much free money/swag they can when R\* does this.
---
Same exact situation and did the whole thing without armor and a regular ass super sledge
---
When i have to limit myself to outputting 30% dmg of what i normally do and wearing no armor in order for the game to be challenging the problem is not me.

I enjoy cleaning all the dirty plasticware off the table after a meal but choosing one exact plate halfway down the table to sit down and admire for a bit.
---
Yea me and my friend now know we've wasted a lot of time lol. Thank you for the help
---
This is bait right?
---
It has been six months and we are all waiting for repeatable end game content. They have had six months of chance.
---
&gt; Some with actual money for Atoms, and others with our time, attention, and word of mouth marketing.
---
If you see playing the game as "paying for it" I dont think you are playing it for the right reasons.  
---
Maybe its just me, but I have the attitude of "I already have about 500 hours in this game, I already have more than my moneys worth, and each and every bit of content they add, big or small, that I dont pay for, is a bonus"  
---
Like when you go to buy a phone, your gonna buy it anyway but when your paying for it the guy sais you actually get a free smart watch with this phone too "cool, bonus" oh and heres some free earphones too "cool, another bonus" (this actually happened to me and is a good example)
---
Sheepsquatch is only hard if you're an idiot.
---
Burrows is just a snore.
---
Damn, I‚Äôve never been to LFG but I was searching for days for a full set of BoS combat unyielding sentinel offering max caps and didn‚Äôt get any offers. 
---
Finally found one set yesterday
---
I wouldn't call dying to people spawn camping in the sewer entrance "difficult"
---
I would call it not fun
---
Anyone in the dungeon is insta killed. Lose all junk and half caps.
---
Gotta watch out for those *bullymongs* they‚Äôll rip your eyes out!
---
*Bullymong rips out his eye*
---
There is!
---
Well we already got a piece of repeatable end game content as well as a new game mode
---
Yeah you don't release new content until you fix your old content.  At least the 100% everyone effected broken stuff maybe not the obscure your have to do 20 steps to encounter it bugs but come on now
---
Because if your weapon broke and you would otherwise have to leave the dungeon, therefore, losing the current attempt to get through, it can be resolved for the small price of "give us some real life money and you wont lose this dungeon"  
---
People who dont pay have to leave and come back for another attempt  
---
People who do pay just repair and keep on going
---
Based on PSNProfiles, about 7.5% of tracked profiles have gotten the award for reaching level 100.
---
How long will you be on? I might be on in 30 minutes or so. If so, I'll look for you. I'm whatgives22
---
I forget the name (only played it a couple times) but you bring a "recall keycard circuit board" to a terminal somewhere near Lewisburg. 
---
What part are you at exactly.  Whats the last thing you did?
---
I really hope there is more to this that we havent found yet
---
Lol saying 2-4 players does sound like a boss fight or sum!
---
It's not so bad if you switch to chronological order but the "hot" tab is always a wall of duplicate posts.
---
this is a dumb post from a tard that doesn't get that Bethesda Austin has done little to no ACTUAL work on this game between the bugs and lack luster "DLC" even the gameplay already in the game is lack luster many people are upset and for good reason so STFU and stop the fanboing out and defending shitty game design and lack of actually caring about its community.
---
There's 43 of them, most of the [different animals, a few cryptids, and Scorchbeast/Queen!](/spoiler) Also some antlers/skulls.
---
I believe there's a mod that let's you do this.  Mods can fix a lot of stuff. Like I use a mod that fixed the new repair option to be just T again. I use a mod that lets me get in and out of my power armor super fast. I use a mod that changes my map to show every resource node. Mods are great.
---
You know, I was gonna downvote you for implying they were gonna start charging for DLC even though they said that "all DLC is going to e free"  
---
But then I remembered they want to start putting non cosmetics in their cosmetic only atom shop
---
Right like its insane that people are still making excuses like this, it really worries me that so many people are so eager to praise and defend such shoddy work
---
2 counting SBQ and Sheepsquach
---
Hmm, normally I'm a pro-Bethesda voice, saying c'mon give 'em a chance. But challenges that can't even be done because of delayed release?
---
Sigh
---
*walks off*
---
Where do you get the side quests?
---
Instanced?
---
Look at the typical bad comment and then go through the user's profile. If the average person in this sub was over 10 years old or didn't work for Bethesda I would be quite suprised. This is the only game reddit where comments on the broken game get downvoted. Odd.
---
I'll say.
---
1. Protection from inadvertent loss.
---
2. Storage management. 
---
We have plenty space now, but looking to the future we're going to be getting more content which usually means more gear. Not to mention, we're most likely going to be moving to a phase where a 'one size fits all' approach to gear isn't going to cut it and specialized equipment will be need for certain enemies. This, along with player vending is going to make space a premium. Being able to destroy and recreate a 20 lbs weapon or 12 lbs armor piece gives the player more freedom to enjoy the wasteland and spend less time with inventory management.
---
20 lbs is 9.08 kg
---
 Hey so I am upset too but they didn't advertise it as instanced, we all just assumed they were going to do that to avoid the clusterfrack that is uninstanced dungeons. That thing that pretty much every other game studio does because it is a terrible damn idea to let your entire server into a place meant for a small party to trounce content.
---
If you're on in about 4 hours, I can give you some free Marine Armor plans :)
---
My point is more specific to this new content really, literally a couple hours after release people will just completely criticise the new content because they have blazed through it 3-4 times already, but they can‚Äôt have any sort of idea whether this is it or whether there‚Äôs so much more. 
---
Bethesda haven‚Äôt had the best reputation recently fair enough, but they are fixing what was broke, breaking a little bit more unintentionally, balancing what may or may not need to be balanced, and adding new content all at the same time. I just think the players should just be patient before posting ‚ÄòI‚Äôm so finished with this game‚Äô when the new content is not what they want currently.
---
As a dev this isn't that hard  to do its a quite simple mechanic
---
I found 4 legendarys, 2 1*, 1 2*, 1 3*
---
You punched an egg? Duuuude relax.
---
Yeah see this wasnt ever really 1 they were heavily advertising either, so its not like they made it out to be the super dungeon everyone was hoping for, that would be the vaults and to a lesser extent, the Arktos Pharma dungeon we should be seeing soon
---
 I am quite vexed at the Burrows because of how it was presented as a big deal instead of the random small content update it is, but let's not get all weekend programmer here.  
---
Having actually explored the map instead of just heading for the objective, I would expect it to take about 3 weeks of 95-workdays at modest productivity to build it, for a small team, and accounting for all of the triggers in it. There are new decorative assets, several event triggers with some chains of effect, and the map is fairly large and full of decorative clutter. It's just a depressingly pointless map because the quest is straight forward and uninteresting, with no real payoff for the effort invested.
---
You have to be aiming all the time for this to be good. But with that being said, add 50 for damage resistance and 20 percent extra damage against other players. Good for pvp, okay for adventure. Its not too bad. 5k seems to be fair.
---
Mounted wendigo plan?!   Well shit I know what I‚Äôm doing after work.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bdwn6f/two_new_quests_with_the_burrows_update_mounted/
---
Yeah im aware there were a couple legendary ghouls and gutsies but overall just a complete undershot of what i expected.
---
If it's been since launch, they've added some content: The brewing station, which involves a little quest chain, the sheepsquach thing, which added a bit more, and the Burrows, which adds very little.
---
There can also be zero legendary enemies or there can be multiple
---
Can we hook up a generator to the electric chair and have it actually work? I'd prefer that over using my pip-boy in a chair
---
For a half hour? Yeesh, nice.
---
Backpack hasn't been added yet
---
Really as a level 24 I‚Äôm not even ready to go in there sheepsquach seemed like I‚Äôll never do it so I‚Äôm not to mad could be longer from what I‚Äôve seen and maybe better loot
---
Big ol‚Äô let down! I was pumped for this! The way they talked about it you would of thought it was going to be some what of a challenge! I got all geared up for some long haul and we were done in 10 minutes lol.
---
At this rate Bethesda could hire anyone and they could make better story and dungeons
---
I'm trying to keep a balanced perspective on this game, because I do enjoy it so much and worry I'm not being objective.  I don't want to complain about every little thing, but also don't want to overly praise things that appear to fall short. 
---
By the way, that example with the phone has never happened to me, and sounds awesome.
---
It's fairly large, but there is no reason to go through about half of it, and it's not instanced so there usually is a lot less action than expected. And it sure the hell didn't promise any sort of challenge.
---
Is it just me, or is the mounted wendigo really low-res and missing it's teeth even on max texture settings???
---

---
Speak for yourself. I‚Äôve never bought a seasons pass. 
---
Pre-orders, seasons passes, and deluxe editions... we have met the enemy and they are us. Developers didn‚Äôt destroy gaming. Customers did. 
---
I‚Äôve played plenty of great games and bought plenty of expansions, but either for money I was glad to part with after a great base-game or after learning what I was getting for my dollar.
---
Why are they making new content for the players that don't need new content as they have the whole base game already ? At this point new content should be for the endgame players as they are the ones who don't have anything to do.
---
Low level players have the whole freaking game
---
The event is only once, but you can server hope and go in there again. My second time through, the assaultron at the end was not a legendary, but I did have a few legendary ghouls.
---
A HUGE new quest line is coming later, this is just a small sample.  Anyone expecting it to be 'hard' clearly didn't bother to read the statement that it was for 2 level 50 players.  Throw in 20+ players at level 100+ and of course it's a cake walk.
---
This is what we need. 
---
Not the man we deserve, but the man we need.
---
I feel you brother. Big ol' let down!
---
That you can never lose, not even in survival mode...
---
Guys, I'm putting all of my caps into bobby pins.
---
Have 20+ people go in the glassed caverns at once and it's probably a breeze too.
---
Yeah you don't release new content until you fix your old content.  At least the 100% everyone effected broken stuff, maybe not the obscure your have to do 20 steps to encounter it bugs. But you fix the everyone effected ones
---
Doesn't help they had to bump back half the content so far, so every "new content" day looks shallower than originally planned.
---
Because we paid 60 dollars for this mess
---
No, comes out next week.
---
Yeah thats fair, and yeah it was awesome, although after a few months the metal clip pinged off the watch strap and i still havent gotten around to fixing it yet
---
BeTeHSdA ShOUlD hIrE YoU

I think there are good points being made on both sides here.
---
Oh I thought we were getting it today
---
No, got delayed though the daily's are bugged and all involve the camera unfortunately.
---
I personally have gone through twice, but the last boss was not a legendary the second time.
---
Dang
---
Southern Belle motel, by boomer on a table
---
He actually showed up at my camp yesterday and tried to destroy it. I just logged out before he could do any real damage but he seems like a real d!CK.
---
It's kind if how the game was intended to be played so I wouldn't call it wasted.
---
Info's removed, anyone know what he does?
---
I thought maybe you could fix a broken camera. Looted one but no luck.
---
Normally me too. They don't make it easy.
---
I can‚Äôt upvote you fast enough UGH. 
---
The Atom store stuff wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if they didn‚Äôt charge Fortnite-range prices for Skins. 
---
(Also if we had actual neat stuff but that‚Äôs a whole other argument)
---
The balance in this game is pretty fucked right now. As a high level, many people have been grinding long enough to get good weapons and figure out their own good play style. Many high levels want the spongey enemies (similar to something like a 4 man SBQ) and I don't think Bethesda anticipated that people would simply grind the game this hard for loot. My main point is that the game really needs new "zones" per se where the enemies begin at something like level 200 and the final boss of that zone could be something like 350 (not with an 8+ player focus maybe scaled to 4 man squads to get group focus). It would work similar to any other MMO expansion. That or Bethesda could simply begin scaling weapons with new modes similar to Borderlands where the game restarts completely but enemies, weapons, quests, etc. would be scaled to new levels say 200+.
---
I crawled through every inch of it in about 50 minutes.
---
Some fun bullet points:
---
* Nothing stronger than any other normal location in the game.
---
* Mobs respawn in clustered groups at random times, like right in front of my face.
---
* Only no star Legendaries (like Whitesprings), only drop 1 star items and lvls are random. (Yay low level bloodied combat rifle /s)
---
* No new mobs, not even any different looks or effects
---
* I un-intentionally walked through all the "puzzles" to the end, then walked back to the beginning, then the quest started.
---
* No idea what I missed or didn't miss, items and lore wise, because 3 other teams of players were racing around the area at the same time.
---
My disappointment is palpable, but not unexpected.
---
I live by HF so def about to add this to my daily grind.  I think its cool there is a good chance for a legendary spwan.
---
I just got to level 52 and I haven‚Äôt actually finished the main quest line yet, I‚Äôm just chilling in the mire. Sheepsquatch is pretty tough but with help I‚Äôve succeeded a few times. I pretty much only solo unless I bump into some random people, so I‚Äôm excited that I will probably find this pretty tough on my own and it should feel rewarding. 
---
I feel I have pretty mediocre gear so I‚Äôm definitely not OP like a lot of people complaining about it, but I haven‚Äôt played yet. At work!
---
&gt;at burrows did you go through? I found about 15 legendaries in my hour down there, including two 3\* ghouls (3\* bloodied handmad
---
I had one single legendary ghoul that dropped 1\* wooden armor.
---
A single legendary.

You can get his spikes at toxic larry's

Personally I find people are mad because AGAIN the content was too easy. 
---
It‚Äôs going to be easy if you went and cookie cut the current one hit wonder build. 
---
Those that didn‚Äôt or don‚Äôt have the means to do so. This is akin to the WS GC. Just more open and large scale. 
---
Gives more opportunities to those that want farm but are too late to get in on it or simply can‚Äôt
---
The one who wanted to use the nukes was Secretary (and later President) Eckhart, due to his father abandoning his company as a child to become a communist, leaving him bitter. He released the Liberators, Super Mutants, and eventually the Scorchbeasts on Appalachia to lower DEFCON because he was so rabidly anti-Communist. MODUS gassed the bunker because Major Ragansdottier freed General Santiago and attempted to blow up MODUS, but only damaged his memory banks. 
---
He also seems disturbed when he first sees Scorchbeasts upon reconnecting to the Kovac-Muldoon, saying something along the lines of ‚ÄúWhat are those...*things*?!?‚Äù
---
I totally disagree here as a normally patient player. This game needs end game content that can't be solo'd badly. The sheepsquatch imposter was a tiny step in the right direction and this "dungeon" was a triple backflip with a twist in the totally wrong direction.
---
I would be right there with you if there wasn't 40+ years worth of RPG examples of how to succeed and fail at dungeon design to inform the devs. This dungeon tells every experienced gamer everywhere that this dev crew doesn't know the first thing about online gaming.
---
Over and over and over...
---
Lol guess we got our new boss last week
---
Play in adventure mode more
---
Unreliable data; does not specify accounts no longer active. Doesn't account for people who quit the game early/midway through.
---
Ohhh well now that looks interesting...
---
To be faiiihhhrrrrrr
---
Geez first people are bitching because the fake sheepsquatch fight was too hard and now that the Barrows are to easy? Bethesda could have quit on 76 after the failed launch but they've tried to implement new features but I guess nobody is ever happy.
---
I think bethesda took it like people actually wanted a dungeon, like you said not a mmo dungeon but an actual dungeon from fucking elder scrolls.
---
This is primetime comedy
---
Lotta ideas. Switch servers. Leave survival. Passive mode.
---
Oh that would be sweet, thank you for the offer!
---
Enjoy what makes YOU happy.
---
Cool, thank you.
---
What HUGE new quest line are you talking about?
---
Don't claim work shops
---
So? I was in your server and nothing started. Now i'm queued in another where you should be. Great.
---
Did you guys break the bed in the process?
---
People solo‚Äôd it when the server launched no problem. 
---
A level 45 Assaultron? *Really?*
---
This defeated the BoS?
---
Taking a workshop puts you in open pvp. If you don't want to deal with that, don't claim workshops.
---
There's 4 quests there. 2 of them will give you heads. There's another one that starts on a patio table next to busted boomer at the southern belle hotel.
---
You have a TSE weapon it‚Äôs going to feel easy.
---
Maybe you are too good! Lol!
---
perfectly said.
---
And not see anything but myself sitting down.
---
The other day I saw several of these dead brahmin events in a row as I was walking along that riverfront road along the western edge of the map.  First it was just three, then four, then four surrounded by mannequins.  I started to think, "is this a reference to cattle mutilation," and who pops up?  The Flatwoods Monster.
---
Is there a connection?  Fuck if I know.
---
I concur, we must wipe him out. 
---
Ad Victoriam.
---
My friend and I did some test with melee ladt night. We both stripped down to only mutations and used roughly a 100 damage weapon.  We both had 50 DR. And used blocker. I took 29 damage which suggests reducing damage before DR and damage is compared. If it was post it should've been close to 37
---
100 damage versus 50Dr should be 66ish damage. 45% reduction of that should be 37ish
---
55 damage versus 50 DR should be 29ish
---
We tried testing with power attacks it should've raised the damage by 50% which we then added armor to get to 75 DR would be 150 versus 75DR which should've been like returned 96ish damage.  But it returned far more like closer to 130. 
---
We both got in full sets of power armor, our regular melee did roughly 10% of our hp, but power attacks took out roughly 60%. 
---
So we don't know why, but power attacks seem to have some inate armor pen maybe? No test we worked out gave us good numbers.
---
Yeah it is troublesome to say the least.
---
Server hop to avoid the assholes. It‚Äôs the least you can do until you climb the food chain and become a worthy enough adversary to either make them fuck off or think twice about contesting ü§†
---
They said the game was meant to play in survival mode you ever notice you can hear what's going on outside? I have a feeling that and footstep volume were for PvP!
---
By the time I got to the Burrows.. it was empty. Me and 3 or 4 other people running around looking for something to kill but everything was dead already. =(
---
What do you expect from an already shit developer
---
National observatory offices south of sugar Grove have tons of telephones, fuses, light bulbs
---
They aren't exactly the same thing, but it would be very naive to believe that the same game developer wouldn't be applying some of the same psychological triggers in both the products. This isn't a mobile game, but it is a "game as a service," where they want you to stay hooked and to keep you playing the game (so that you in turn buy atoms). They also want to minimize costs. 
---
People need to get off the emotional roller-coaster of idealizing bethesda the minute they see some positive behaviour, only to get upset the next moment their feelings are dashed with the next seemingly inevitable disappointing thing happens. 
---
Bethesda, the company, isn't your friend. The developers may be awesome people doing hard work. But they're not the ones calling the shots by making the business decisions, allocating budgets and schedules, etc. Just like each previous debacle with this game since beta, the only way the company will learn from their mistakes is if people act with their wallets and also vocalize their concerns.
---
If the way they're supporting the game is disappointing to you, act on it.
---
That would be amazing! I‚Äôm central time, its 520 now. I‚Äôll probably be on around 1030 my time when I get home from work. Add me up.
---
GT: flipidyflop
---
They delayed it today. Sorry.
---
I would love a notebook option like this
---
Wow fuck yes.
---
Not in survival and have passive mode on already
---
Log out.  Log back in.
---
I‚Äôm in adventure mode, that‚Äôs the thing
---
Oh look at mister multifunction over here who can sit and breathe at the same time
---
I didn't get anything but "The Gutter" because I zoned in and like three other people were ahead of me so all I heard while running around was gunshots further in and finding piles of meat that had no loot for me...
---
If you're gonna call it a dungeon, if you're gonna imply I need a buddy, don't just drop me into someone elses instance that they're already running through the place killing everything...its a waste of my time.
---
You should post "Spoilers" in your title so that people who are at work and checking Reddit don't have the dungeon ruined by your emotion filled post. 
---
Jackass.
---
That makes sense. There are a lot of high farming areas I‚Äôm noticing. Luckily my screw run for farming is still usually untouched üòÇ
---
Third option takes all, don‚Äôt claim shops others own
---
Even un-nuked, Whitesprings can be an easy way to level, as it's generally not so packed that you can't survive (just avoid the golf club location if you're alone).
---
Alternatively, with Watoga no longer being a world of farming high levels, if you go there and do the quest chain to become Mayor for the Day, you get an easy source of nonhostile robots to farm.
---
Finally, don't forget your XP buffs. Cranberry foods and sleeping in a bed both buff XP gains, and as small as it sounds, it is noticable when leveling pre-50.
---
I think my buddy had to do this all in one go and it still made him repeat parts to complete.
---
&gt; Making something weaker is not nerfing it
---
That's literally the definition of nerfing. You can pretend words mean something entirely different from what they mean‚Äîbut that doesn't stop everyone else from using them with their proper meaning in mind.
---
I never had trouble getting them. Its decrypting the damn code that I can't do. 
---
Nukacrypt has the silo codes, usually withing a couple hours of the reset. I run around and gather the code pieces only so it doesn't feel like I'm cheating. Then go on nukacrypt and get the code.
---
I‚Äôm an extremely patient player and I still stick by the fact that they need to work out the balance.
---
I can‚Äôt see them taking the time to make a dungeon trailer with multiple levels and then just deciding to make something completely different.
---
You can‚Äôt just program a flawless dungeon with multiple levels which is tailored to everyone. There will be mistakes with it which people clearly think is the difficultly which is completely fair but again, the finished article can not be judged off the first 5-6 hours of release.
---
Believe me I wish there was some communication from the devs saying ‚Äúhey guys we promise this isn‚Äôt it, just stick with us‚Äù but they aren‚Äôt robots, they are real people with lives just as busy as ours, they need time to make their game what we want it to be.
---
Where do you get steel
---
So I go in thinking this is going to be awesome. I pop a bobblehead, a magazine, make sure my weapons are fixed, I have plenty of ammo, stimpacks, ect. I run thro find nothing worthy of the 10 minutes I spent down there. There are piles and piles of meat, where the people that were ahead of me killed everything. I can say I have plenty of junk to replace the ammo I waisted and even junk to sell to the vendors. The couple legendaries I find are definately going to go to a vendor.
---
Or how about Modus sending you to stop another player's nuclear launch in progress. That would be fun.
---
Truth be told, a tse shotgun is still very strong. What gear, perks, and mutations are you running?
---
I'm the same time zone too! I get on at 830pm and study online for about 4 hours.
---
I sometimes sit down in chairs I'm passing by, generally when I'm looking for things in a nearby drawer. It's paralyzing.
---
I think this will get really popular soon.
---
what game exactly have you been playing
---
Yup otherwise everyone is stealth all the time lol
---
Works perfectly then! Yeah I‚Äôm usually in for about 2-3hrs starting at about 1030 -11 depending on if I have my kid that night or not. Well I do really appreciate it too
---
I use 2, i just swap it in occasionally
---
Armor is a scatter of effects, most of it Combat armor, perks are just shotguns and dog food, and the only mutation is Speed Demon.
---
Passive doesn't work when you claim a workshop - automatic PvP.
---
Any way to get in touch with these data miners and ask about "Smarty's Big Critter Bait" (as featured in one of the unsolved mysteries quests.) I've a hunch that may be the key we need, either now or whenever they enable it.
---
Dude... It's coming. All of you need to chill.
---
It mean it was okay. It wasn‚Äôt anything extraordinary, but it wasn‚Äôt as bad as it could have been. I mean it seemed like something you‚Äôd do early game, with the final boss being an enemy that was easy for most players.
---
This update gives me hope the Mosaic floor will come back at some point because the flower pattern door was in the game previously and removed from the atom shop.  I missed the Mosaic floor and I really want it for my camp.
---
We will never have a GREAT online Fallout game if we let shitty game design like this update and constant push backs of heavily demanded features like player vendors slide, if we don't put our foot down as a community this game will never become the online Fallout we all want and deserve we paid Bethesda for a game that is riddles with bugs and has halfheartedly been scrapped together if you care about this game you all should hold Bethesda Austin more accountable for their terrible decisions.
---
Or change worlds is the best option
---
Did u nuked it already? Or that is theory?
---
I think the over encumbered things goes further back than the last patch. Pretty sure you just have to manage the weight better
---
Different studio, and it's more like a season pass, not DLC. Drip content. Stop being dramatic and throwing a fit. Also, it's free. Jesus christ. Now i remember why i left this sub.
---
Already nuked
---
Fuck damn mate 
---
I want to join next nuke
---
I love the sheepsquath even my medic build is great for it. I can easily tank 2 pylons and struggle but manage all 3. But since whenever I spam stims it heals teammates, I felt like I could contribute beyond damage. I only ended up burning 30 stimpacks if tanking two and closer to 50 if tanking all three.
---
Its coming ? Can you link the source for that one.
---
Because i saw it in the teaser photos for the burrows and well when they tease you content you usually get access to said content when its released.
---
So i would really like to know where they confirmed that we get the suit at a later date and why.
---
What stage did you leave it at?
---
I'm getting on today to gather the ingredients, hoping that isn't gone when I get there.
---
Yeah, so after ready the Bethesda suggested level requirements I did know what to expect. Very much underwhelming and sad.
---
No, that's not what it means. Lets look at the origination of the term nerf. Back in the day, in a multiplayer game the devs reduced the effectiveness of a weapon type. They didn't make it useless, it was just weaker. People were complaining that it felt like they replaced that weapon with nerf bats, thus nerf. So no, it never has and never will mean **just** making something totally useless. It's literally **any time** the effectiveness is reduced.
---
Cool.
---
Pl is right
---
yeah ,that doesn't affect server stability/s
---
Not to start anything, but if you hate the game so much, then don't play it. There is no need to rain on everyone else's parade just because you haven't had the most superb of experiences with it.  :)
---
Wow, was expecting at least a little more.
---
Theres a mountain in the savage divide that has about 12-16 steel nodes, and I usually hit up a few super mutant spots, low level. Then scrap all their guns with the scraper card equipped and get about 12 steel each from those. 
---
Also a few towns on the map are loaded with cans and buckets, so I just run thru and grab everything. In about an hour I can get at least 1k steel.
---
Pretty sure they just need to fix the damn game and stop reintroducing bugs.
---
I'm going to sleep but you can join me next time i'm online. Ign landromat
---
The design of the map, like rest of the game is great. I think they need to add some difficulty to the end boss or even buff the ghouls. I dunno though, when they buffed the queen, the whining on here was ridiculous and she was perfectly beatable. So it probably depends on player's iq xD I did like the southern belle mission, where they put in a something to read in order to unlock the terminal. It was super easy but I'm sure a few got raged.
---
I did see a bag on the ground when got to the assaultron, it was a bad day for someone.
---
When will I ever learn. Almost useless area.
---
So the burrow ghouls glow also?
---
Are sales allowed on this sub, or only on the market/bazaar?
---
go play warframe then. cya
---
Just keep it off the far end of the bridge, that my camp!!
---
Free vendor fodder :D
---
it doesnt
---
So apparently 2 new quests were added this morning.  Check out the below post a few hours later.  I rest my case.
---

Is it something I can go through by myself
---
Don't forget about stags
---
Honestly I've never been in a nukes Harper's ferry but ive always imagined it would be fun as hell, especially now.
---
It was
---
Trueeee
---
Totally worth it now
---
It‚Äôs not a bug. It‚Äôs intentional.
---
You'll have to go through [my army](https://i.imgur.com/cMNjiUJ.jpg) first!
---
It was definitely a disappointment but hopefully Bethesda adds onto these past add ons. I‚Äôd like to see more evolution in the sheepsquach as well. I like the event. It‚Äôs challenging. But I‚Äôd like to see more storylines and dailies from them. Alcohol was the last thing I liked.
---
No. The prize bot gets blasted as soon as it comes within visual range.
---
&gt;when they buffed the queen, the whining on here was ridiculous
---
&gt;I did see a bag on the ground when got to the assaultron, it was a bad day for someone.
---
Most Fallout players wouldn't know 'hard' if their uncle came into their room at night.
---
Oh ure pc, I‚Äôm on ps4
---
Not the easiest words they still "feel" the same
---
Do I have 7 minutes?
---
Lmao lovely
---
Sure
---
Listening to the Negan expy: Lucille/10
---
I wish food didn't cost so much budget though
---
Appreciate
---
I tried but it was on Cooldown. I‚Äôm thinking about creating a group to farm the event. Jumping server to server.
---
I knew he wanted to use the nukes, but I thought MODUS was the one that released the Scorched. He almost admits to as much while going through the questline.
---
To be fair, there isn't much difference between a lvl 50 and a lvl 100 beyond perfecting their build. Also I did it on my own, it really wasn't that hard. But I always appreciate new content, especially when it is free.
---
Tried to see if you could fix a broken camera on tinkerers, nothing. Why is it in the daily atoms though?
---
If a dungeon takes me 10 minutes to complete with a single stimpak and 200 ammo then i really dont see how "waiting a bit" changes anything.
---
Im all in for testing but if its 10 minutes every two weeks until after a year we might actually see content that would be suitable for the players now then no thanks.
---
I really didn't buy just to be a playtester
---
Oops. You are correct.
---
This is why people get ticked off.  It‚Äôs a major glitch yet they don‚Äôt seem to GAF.
---
You can leave and repair. You'll be in loading screens longer than it actually takes.
---
What? You saying you've gotten out of your PA while in a nuke zone and trying to group up with someone? An area where both is really beneficial.
---
Or not being able to jump at a busy event. Much funs. Obviously we have a limited number of buttons, but one of those could have been mapped better. It's not like turning your light on accidentally is very detrimental. That would have made far too much sense.
---
Plus whisky/ psychobuff
---
You're overreacting. 
---
This is just The Burrows "Beta".
---
There is one quest, nothing more. The dungeon ends where the quest ends, what more could there be?
---
Yep yep..but can get addicted lol
---
Maybe a Snarly Yow? Another Appalachian cryptic we haven‚Äôt really seen. Like a big wolf basically.
---
Nice theory but my legit drop melee stuff is way stronger than my who-knows-provenance TSE handmade that I bought for caps. Stealth and melee are the OP that TSE hasn‚Äôt been since the nerf. 
---
With the right build you don‚Äôt need duped gear to one-hit your way through everything-smaller-than-SBs.
---
I disagree, I think the quests in this game are a lot better than the bland and shit quests from previous fallout games. Such as ‚Äúgo find x family member.‚Äù Everything looks shitty when you have a shit attitude like you do
---
You're better off with a rolling pin
---
Whatever.
---
After several hundred hours, I had to take a break. I dare not ask: how's the loot?
---
Junk yes, but half caps would be harsh. I'd rather people are sent back to the beginning of whatever section they were on and have to try again. That way you can make things much more difficult without it feeling cheap or punishing, like "Oh great we wiped five times and now I'm out of caps."
---
What the fuck? Now you're not making sense worth a bag of shit. Just shut up, use your head, and we can stop this conversation.
---
No, sorry, and I just completed the new dungeon solo, but there were other people who were in there too probably why it was so easy
---
/s ?
---
Is that really an excuse though? They may have no experience making them, but they MUST have played them at some point. Honestly it feels like more of a lack of imagination than skill.
---
Thanks for the mini-quest updates! They were definitely more challenging and interesting than the Borrows.
---
That actually sounds like a pretty good idea, I'm on board. Plus, Bethesda supposedly adding in the fridge to camps to keep food from spoiling so quickly would help lol.
---
but do they respawn when you exit the burrows and come back ?
---
Not really sure yet but if I remember BIV talks about this being a daily quest so it's probably a reward you can get from it
---
Sorry man, it was my first time and I didn‚Äôt knew the mechanic. But I‚Äôll be jumping from server to server to kill it. Wanna join me?
---
They are letting you join the Pioneer Scouts. And Bethesda considers it a main questline. So I'm expect 10 main quest with 4 or 5 side quest, although I might be asking for to much.
---
You did
---
u/NutSupreme
---
I feel like I'm about to post a Bigfoot sighting, but I was over by the Overseers camp I swear to god I heard a roar, I went from hidden to caution almost to danger, heard some strange noises I've never heard before and before I could see or vats it the sound was gone and I was back up to full hidden. I then proceeded to hide in my base.
---
LMAO, it was crazy, The Overseer's camp is pretty close to that one field spawn point, so who knows.
---
Looks like they're not
---
I put in my recommendation to accept MyLittleShadow's offer. Good and fun peeps -- he and the rest, of which there are many. (I am a woman btw.)
---
Sometime in BETA, around the same time as the flower door.  There was a fruit bowl hat too!
---
I mean you'd be naive to think that ANY mobile game wouldn't be a MTX shitfest. Every large developer has a mobile MTX shitfest out for the most part...so we should judge their console games based on the mobile games?
---
This is nut worthy
---
Mcdeath
---
Tell her she's better off with almost any other legendary affix for melee weapons because they get 75% armor pen from a perk. That means that her mole miner gauntlet is only causing an additional 12.5% penetration, and with the way DR works that's most likely entirely negligible unless you're attacking the SBQ. Seriously, 10% damage inc from a mutants mole miner gauntlet would probably yield higher damage 95% of the time.
---
Lol, i got the impression that when you normally exit the burrows and come back they respawn.. so they made it that if you try to farm it with a nuke then you are shit outta luck : D
---
That‚Äôs not a bug. You‚Äôre carrying too much. Please work on inventory management.
---
The story is good, they just really need to pull some talent from a successful online rig company. Like Blizzard. Which lost a lot of their best when Activision bought them out. No brainer really.
---
I wish it was easier to place down
---
Dammit. Must have been the days that I was too sick to play, I got the fruit hat but never saw the fez or flower door.
---
End game meaning things to do after you complete the main story
---
Lmao, the .50 cal bullet holes really gave it that ‚Äúlived in‚Äù look.
---
You got at least two others if you sort by new lol
---
Took me about 10 mins on my own and there really wasn't much enemies.
---
They didn't. But we will. It was teased, it will happen. I want to know why you think it was confirmed a burrows drop? Same thing, it wasn't.
---
It didn't do this on patch 7, or 6,5,4,3.
---
Not seeing any patch notes saying this was being introduced in Adventure mode. Can't even respawn at my camp. Survival mode.. sure, train stations or the vault..
---
I just finished the quest. Honestly, I was disappointed more on the lore aspect of it. You really didn't get much BOS despite the setup, and the final part was a bit disappointing as a payoff be that the weak boss fight or ending to the story. The actual area is a decent labyrinth with a solid amount of enemies, but its a bit too easy to end up missing out on the legendaries with so many other players likely to be joining you inside. As for difficulty, it was a bit on the easy side, but that was somewhat expected with how used to the game I and others likely are by now. I died only once and that was due to bad luck &amp; being an idiot and not hooking up my controller up before it ran out of power. When I died I could only respawn in a far off place. Someone stole my shit before I even got back to the Burrows. That one kind of pissed me off, and I hope they make some changes about respawning in places like the Burrows.
---
Even with my disappointments I enjoyed the area. I think Arkos and the vaults will likely be a bit more scaled up in difficulty so I'm not super worried about them.
---
3 of my 5 runs had zero legendaries, the other 2 had multiple. Random spawns like every other place
---
Well, they were mostly using energy weapons, mostly lasers from what I've seen on the BOS bodies.  
---
It's perfectly reasonable they got wiped out.
---
Please stop
---
I can't cringe anymore
---
It hurts
---
The Wastelanders quest line coming later this year.  It'll be huge.
---
fun fact, i was actually looking for bugs to kill for meat just so i could fast travel when i came across the encounter, bugged speed demon is starting to get a little annoying...
---
Imagine thinking you ideas could be worth something.
---
This would run at 10 FPS and be a bug ridden mess by the time Bethesda are done with it, but still sounds better than the Burrows.
---
I‚Äôm just glad Bethesda keeps adding more content and quests to the game.
---
Join me!!
---
Yes it felt like fallout 3 metro.. if you took away any challenge, lore and made that you could explore the entirety of the metro in 10 minutes.
---
Jesus Christ you're here AND on the Bethesda forums?? Is there anywhere you have not asserted your dominance? Even the bunnies cry out in worship!

We have go server hop
---
All of you complaining about this "DLC" are fucking stupid. It's not DLC! It is drip feed content, like a season pass. Something small and new to do every other week, that's all. And it's FREE.
---
PvP is the nature of the game, but if this guy is continually harrasing you its a pretty douche move.  I know every body else has already said this but just don't claim workshops. Either that or get revenge üòà
---
See ive found the decrypted before online. My biggest issue was I thought I needed code pieces to even do it
---
I thought that wasn't a good boss for the end of the dungeon either. I guess the BoS are just cannon fodder now.
---
Sorry
---
There is the literal definition posted earlier proving everything you just said is wrong. Your example is exactly what I just said, they made something so weak that they felt like they replaced the weapons with Nerf bats. You have to make something very weak and useless to make that comparison. 
---
You think you know better but everything you said is either wrong or proves me right. Just because a bunch of people use a word wrong doesn't change it's definition
---
What's addiction if you never get addicted ever if you do pop in a addol. Good bye addiction. My luck (game and real life to this game) is high enough there's no real chance of addiction probably about 10 or less chance of getting it.
---
New entrances? Hidden doors?
---
I really can‚Äôt say what they could do the devs are clearly aware of the OP builds that are being made and the damage output that these have.
---
My gut feeling is that all of this is just to transition into the end game content conservatively, rather than throwing everything as us and making us suffer with the lag/glitches/crashes.
---
If they do this in stages, it gives them more time to make it stable, and it gives us more time to enjoy the new content that is coming out soon, rather than that being lost in the shadow of a multi level dungeon.
---
I have that hat. It‚Äôs a good hat
---
"More importantly" you should be able to switch between third and first person while sitting
---
Watched a stream earlier and they ran it twice.  First run had a couple legendary enemies.  Second run they ran into a few and one of them dropped a 3\* Vanguard Leather chest piece.  I've seen a lot of people posting no legendary drop and others being blessed with it so I'm pretty sure it's all RNG.  I have yet to do it though.
---
If you can't tell, what does *that* say about it...
---
I did get the impression from the stuff that was released, in advance of the Burrows going live, that it would be a tough fight for someone to take on alone and really designed for a party of 2 or more. They did also seem to suggest that the rewards would be good... especially for the first run though, when you completed the Waste Management quest.
---
I love Fallout 76 and have played it more than most other games during the last few months. My main character is level 154, so I figured that the Burrows would be OK for me to try alone. 
---
The truth is, there were just a handful of Level 68 enemies, the same that you find elsewhere in the world... and they were fairly easily dispatched. I am not complaining and I think that Bethesda are doing a great job of introducing new content, along with fixing things as they go. But, I didn‚Äôt find the Burrows any more challenging than a run through Sugar Grove.. and the rewards were uninspiring. Funnily enough, I found a paper bag in the end room that someone else had left, with their unwanted legendary armour reward in it. 
---
This isn‚Äôt a moan, more an observation that there is probably a demand out there for more high level content. I don‚Äôt want to just breeze through stuff all of the time.
---
Join on me
---
To be fair to them, they are much smaller than the main team who made 4, if anything I blame Bethesda as a whle for giving an online game to an inexperienced wing of the company to run and maintain
---
Gatling Plasma doesnt want to keep shooting when I hold down my fire button...it'll shoot off one shot then hang...until I reload it...again...this takes forever when you're being swarmed.
---
If you remember, there was a glitch where you build just about anything so long as you had at least one of the item in the family.  I tried out the door but it just doesn‚Äôt fit in the Ash Heap (that‚Äôs where I camped during the BETA).
---
I think they need some filler material for the 20 - 40 group, but yeah I can see your point.
---
I keep hearing this all over the subreddit. This **is not** an mmo.
---
That also.
---
If you camp there and didn't build a dog house for the dog at the top of the cliff you are a bad person.
---
Ah ok. That's a nice weapon then
---
I wish I had bought it.  NOBODY wears it.
---
That hat is one of my favorite items in the game. I wear it with the military officer's dress uniform.
---
That‚Äôs awesome
---
A special assualtron blade is the main reward, tbh the best loot is a chem container that has like 6 chems in it
---
Oh no, my basic point, besides this lengthy discussion.. is just not make the items one day only for an occasion where you need to login each day to claim a reward at the end. That's what it boils down to. Personally not 100% on board with Fallout 76 following suit for one-day only stuff for login rewards for a special occasion. That's it. If the deathclaw eggs were available for a week it would be better for the player. But it isn't going to be, and it won't. So everything I said here, watch it play out. Pretty easy prediction.
---
I think calling it a dungeon set us all up for failure lol maybe a quest line with a new location to explore?
---
You should make a dedicated ps4 community
---
It's so strange because ESO is pumping out compelling content consistently.
---
If they come out with a pith helmet, I‚Äôll never wear anything else.
---
The burrows is definitely in, I've spent the last several hours playing in the sewers, so you might want to apologize now...
---
I've heard of that but haven't seen it. I don't use plasma though
---
I think the only issue I had was first trying it on survival, it's a hotbed for activity and people are camping the entrances.
---
I wear it and when I go into people's camps I ask them 'Don't you want a want a fanta" and nobody to date has gotten the joke.
---
My character that I ran the parade with got corrupted, so I realize that those decorations are basically gone forever for me now. I wish it was like atomic shop stuff, based on account and not character.
---
Bloody mess should be overkill and serendipity (3) is vital for low health builds.
---
I'm the one who posted it, the literal definition *IN THE DEFINITION HAS THE SHIT I JUST SAID*. It's all informal speech, look up informal words. I can't be bothered with someone this fucking stupid anymore.
---
Which is why I willing to give them some slack. But they have to improve to. That is important.
---
Tell him you're blue screening (or tell him directly that you're not going to play alone with him because he won't stop hitting on you when you've asked him to and leave when the other two leave). Block him for the session. Then find MyLittleShadow (or other friends) and join their world and team.
---
The creep might still be able to see you online and in fallout through the mobile app. But who cares. You have stated your boundaries and asked him to stop. At this point, do what you need to so that you can keep enjoying the game.
---
does anybody know the password to the terminal
---
I actually have a BIT of a suggestion. Certain enemies drop certain types of gear. Legendaries in that creature pool drop legendary weapons and/or armor from the types in their pool. Want a legendary Mole Miners Gauntlet? Better start farming Mole Miners. Super Mutants for assault rifles and whatever else.
---
The effects and specific weapons would still be varied, but you'd at least have a better chance of finding what you are after.
---
Love their album "power the uplink nodes"
---
Server is full(
---
Nah, there should be a dj. Someones gotta be controlling the radio.
---
Even if it's a Mr handy. I miss there being a dj.
---
Yeah there were no hidden doors, and if this is the transition to the end game content they are fucking it up pretty badly.
---
I have no idea how making enemies harder has anything to do with server stability you keep talking about.
---
and what new content that is coming soon? You mean during the summer?
---
Geeze man calm down. Your escalation of anger thro multiple posts is silly. People are allowed to have opinions on a public forum even when they differ from yours. Take a deep breath
---
Keep me updated
---
Yes. Because the majority of people who got banned were banned for harmless actions like picking up a dupers left overs. 
---
Those few people are the exception. Not the rule.
---
I think that they shouldn't have overhyped it. They should've presented at the basic idea of how their dungeons would work.
---
Silos were supposed to be groups of 4 level 50+... and its been soloable since release.
---
While I'm a smidge disappointed to hear the burrows are easy, I'm nonetheless really excited to do it, group or not.
---
You're missing: occasionally your character will do the firing animation however no bullets will fire. This tends to resolve itself after a few-10 rounds or so.
---
We NEED an emote to tell people we are dropping stuff for them. I don't play with a mic at night, so half the time I try and give people things and they run away.
---
Better than level 95 SBQ that disappears underground or flies away
---
I'm just gunna let the upvote/downvote button speak.
---
No no, my bad lmao. That‚Äôs just when a lot of content is coming out, like the Scouts quest line and stuff.
---
Whoa whoa.  20+?  I could've done it easy solo.  Most of it is just ghouls and we all can kill ghouls easy.  Silos are way harder than this.
---
Semi fixes 
---
Stuck in zoom/walking
---
Easy way to reset. Switch to a Melee weapon. And then back.  This will usually reset the issue. If not use your Melee to land one hit then switch back.
---
Have had issue with the shots going way off to the side. ONLY in a silo, in a room with a electric fence/doorway.
---
Fix for me is to switch to fps for that room. And then back to 3rd when done with that area.
---
These are my work arounds and in no way should they cause glitches themselves. And no guarantee that they will work for you.
---
But good luck and party hard fellow hvy gunner
---
Well if i show you a picture with a caption "hey here is a picture of the new stuff coming next week" and they i just scrap 99% of that picture would you be pissed?
---
If you know it will happen, i would really want to see a bgs employee quote on that one. We are talking about bgs here, things don't just "happen"
---
I've been wishing they would do something like this since Beta.
---
When my party is all doing workshop and everything else, we usually sit to show that we're done with our stuff and ready to go whenever everyone else is. Then sitting there I realize I'm thirsty, or I can drop some spoiled food, or I want to change my outfit really quick. Or even just listen to holotapes. I know it only takes another few seconds to stand up and do it but it'd be a lot cooler if it didnt.
---
Server hooping again
---
It‚Äôs the best melee weapon in her arsenal right now since it‚Äôs a 3 star, (anti-armor, +40% swing speed, and +1 strength). I think she has one perk towards armor penetration, Incisor I think, but the rest are towards one handed and swing speed. Might not be the most efficient setup, but she can chop through anything within melee ranger faster than my two-shot Gatling with 9 points in heavy weapons can.
---
In my opinion they should rip out all the science perks make one single science perk, and treat it like makeshift warrior or gun nut. Where it unlocks higher level mods and lowers durability consumed. Of course you need to strip away so that the current perks don't effect energy weapons at all. Thus giving a seperate function to the perk while keeping in line with other similar ones, science perks are just so weird and cumbersome.
---
Freakin scumbag lol. /s
---
No, we hadn‚Äôt found it earlier and we still haven‚Äôt found it yet. Sorry dude.
---
I know right! Either play or don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs that simple
---
They really don't though.
---
Copper ore can be found in a couple more places unlisted so far:
---
1) From Overseer's Camp, go to the river and start following it northward. There will be three nodes on your right in one of the rock overhands edging the river.
---
2) From Whitesprings rail station, the nearby cliff has at least a couple nodes.
---
Don't forget to bring your excavator PA if you have it for bonus ore.
---
Oof,... that's a bummer
---
Yes this please! Oh my lord, I've been wanting this since Fallout 3 haha. It makes more since in an online game yo! I'd pay ATOMS for it too even!
---
Err, yeah, I did actually. I found a mod I didn‚Äôt already have in a mod box pickup, put it on at a Workbench. Why would I research posts on something that literally doesn‚Äôt affect me. Hence my comment. You‚Äôre not helping the whiny observation here buddy.
---
I went super serious, then messed around
---
Called my TS Lever Action "The Problem Solver"
---
Called my Vampire Sledgehammer w/ SS "Quick Wacky- Wack"
---
Awe so sweet that you care about meaningless votes. 
---
Bottom line is many people feel like the content drip is not enough and are expressing their opinion about it. Getting mad and swearing at people is childish
---
It‚Äôs full again Jesus
---
Just used Google to listen to song and it says:
---
 Butcher Pete by Roy Brown
---
1 get off Reddit
---
2 play the game
---
3 cranberry's
---
Power armor is pretty basic (Excavator, Nuka Power Armor and Nuka Quantum Power Armor for my T51 and X01)
---
My normal armor and apparel is called My whatever, so I don't sell or drop it

My two super sledges are called All Right Stop and Its Hammer Time

My TSE Tesla shotgun is called The Backup
---
My Quad Broadsider is called The Captain
---
My TSE Harpoon is called The First Mate
---
And my TSE Assaultron Head is called Shooty McShootyFace
---
Gonna have to say I disagree with this post quite thoroughly. 
---
- Reacting to Sheepsquatch was mostly positive. It's true endgame content. Yes it's hard but that's the point and I've seen few people slamming it. 
---
- FO76 is a game that's hurting for meaningful content, and thusly the game's most loyal players are rightfully excited for a new update to keep them invested. The update offers absolutely nothing of value. People are disappointed. This is valid and it's better to give Bethesda CORRECT FEEDBACK instead of just blindly loving the game.
---
They're busy ranting about the Burrows now. No time for old things to harp on, we've got new things now ;).
---
Why would you steal though that's just rude?
---
Sheepsquatch isnt difficult and nothing would have been better than what they were offering vs what was received.
---
You're also assuming I'm one of the people upset. Shocker but I dont care, just pointing out a dungeon isnt one quest and a cave.
---
In the area under the Taxidermy shop, theres thr robot workbench. I believe you use one of the entries there to get the recall code.
---
You should ask Beth , probably 7 of may but only the mighty Godd knows
---
Hey it's okay you can't understand a simple concept. You should still bother with yourself and improve yourself
---
I named my 4* Bloodied sacrifical machete ‚ÄúHappy days‚Äù, named my TS gauss Rifle ‚ÄúThe future is now old man‚Äù, my AAE Handmade ‚ÄúPenetrate and Extrapolate‚Äù, my QE33%+Vats Combat shotgun ‚ÄúThe ol‚Äô boom stick‚Äù, and my AE90%- 50. Cal ‚ÄúButtfucker the Third‚Äù
---
Those are all my basic highlights XD
---
It's a percent chance and ment to make you think carefully about how much you really need
---
Yep. That is the Nuclear Winter phase. But the did decide to put one end game boss to appease the players though.
---
No no no...Todd said it would be awesome, you'd need friends, even high level characters would have a challenge, and the list continues
---
I dont care about the "drip feed" updates I care that we are constantly being lied to and nothing changes
---
Rats versus Bunny‚Äôs.....I‚Äôd pay-per-view that üòÇü§£üòÜ
---
Yes. I get stuck zooming in.
---
I think switching to 1st person and back fixed it for me, but yeah. I've had it happen many times.
---
I got a drill earlier. Worth 2k I guess.
---
Nah fallout 3, Nv, and 4 are on a different level compared to this game. Hey look lets read another note or listen to anothe holotape. So much fun right? Hell no.
---
Server hopping AGAIN
---
bah ha ha, have my upvote, mate.
---
I‚Äôm like oxygen lol freaking EVERYWHERE and all it takes is a spark and I‚Äôm on FIRE üòÇü§£üòÜ
---
You're fucking blind
---
 does anybody know the password to the terminal
---
wtf is that drill made out of 24k gold or something
---
Right? What an oversight. It's love-hate with this game and when stuff like this happens, it just draws more contempt overall.
---
Solomons Pond rocks behind the little house there. I collected about 70-80ish ore with my excavator armor on. There are veins and a node there if no one is camped there.
---
Off the top of my head, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs to prevent people from going on massive junk/weapon runs, then jumping off a cliff and fast traveling to camp... thus avoiding the entire point of being over encumbered to begin with. Which people absolutely would do, regardless of what mode they are in.
---
I like fallout that's why i play it. I expect more from it also, not half assed stuff like they've done with this entry.
---
I get that but 100% of my stims???
---
What an RNG roll
---
Why you need that many? That‚Äôs like 142 pounds committed just to stimpacks *35 if you have the maxed out perk
---
Wild appalachia has clearly been content geared for lower level characters.
---
But of course the level 250 no life's want everything to be about them
---
Yes 100% is possible. It's purely random
---
Joining you
---
I mean. Who the hell carries 142 stims in survival? Lol
---
Thanks. I think I've tried some of these but ill try again.
---
Really like the heavy weapons, especially after the buff. I was so sick of shotgun and melee and rifles weren't doing it.
---
Dont mind him he's probably the typenof person that thinks Overwatch is still a good game too lawl
---
So I'm going to assume that every day this week will have at least 1-2 camera related challenges that we won't be able to do since Bethesda doesn't do hotfixes.
---
After you claim a workshop, follow the **Three C's of workshop survival*.
---
Step 1: Crouch
---
Step 2: Crouch
---
Step 3: Crouch
---
Follow my advice, and you'll never be bushwacked again!
---
I dont like
---
Thanks good one.
---
Ahh gotcha! Yeah there's some good stuff coming up: Scouts quests, player vending, legendary vendor, etc.
---
It's part of the game. It isn't just first come, first serve. It's fight for resources.
---
They stated in their most recent inside the vault that those items are being moved to late April, backpacks in May, they want to release a functioning item late rather than a broken item now (needed more time to make it work)
---
It‚Äôs not about making the enemies harder, it‚Äôs about making the location itself stable as it‚Äôs a completely new environment that they are adding to the world and it needs to work seamlessly for every player.
---
And all the major and minor dlc they have announced, it all needs time and care to be developed.
---
In reality this post wasn‚Äôt made to be popular, it was always going to be battling with the downvotes, it was just to try and express that people want this end game content now, but when they get this end game content and fine tune their builds to be the best it can be, there will be more and more complaints about the difficult enemies being too easy and it‚Äôll become a vicious cycle.
---
Id gladly buy dlc for this game. They dlc they have released for this game shouldn't of even happened. They need to stop wasting their time and manpower on useless content thats good for 30 minutes.
---
Ok, 2k for the drill and I'll throw in a very rare white wolf hat.
---
Seriously though, people are supposed to pay 2k to redo the event and that's the sort of shit you get for it. Stunning.
---
What about a safari suit to go with it
---
Because I wanted some ammo.
---
...Wait. The assaultron is the *end* of the Burrows content? So I *finished* it in a half hour after work?
---
What happened to the challenging dungeon that would be difficult solo?
---
I‚Äôve never finished a silo, not because they are too hard but rather because all three times I‚Äôve tried the game has crashed, wasting resources.
---
Yeah like every so oftern drop a new "Unsolved" mission or something yeah
---
You know what I want? That nuka cola hidden door. Its legot
---
All during radstorms.
---
Sooooo gtfo off the thread then? Self Inflicted in YOU choose to read and comment :)
---
It has meaning. It shows community opinion. Ans currently, it's leaning towards what i said. Deal with that.
---
It's important to establish a welcoming feel for new players. Makes the game better for everyone. I like how it's a repeating cycle. I gifted a baseball bat that was gifted to me at level 5, which carried me through the early game, to a new player, and told him to continue the tradition. I think this makes us more tight-knit as a community and thats great.
---
Thats why I keep my power armor on for about 90% of the game play
---
Never played, not my kind of thing. Try harder.
---
I kinda disagree, I did find the sheepsquatch quest line and side quests enjoyable. Yes it may be a but tedious as such reading notes all the time and terminals, but if it tells a story I‚Äôm happy.
---
I‚Äôm also majorly bummed at the new dungeon, I was hoping for a challange, and it may be for some people, but in my case not so much. I did wish for a sort of better end of dungeon boss and not a normal assaultron, but it‚Äôs drip feed DLC.
---
The DLC will not always be things like Far Harbour or Nuka world, adding in a totally new area, but it‚Äôs good to see that Bethesda is expanding in the world that is quite lacking in some parts. I do hope over time they add stuff to the burrows. But for what it is I‚Äôm not going to overly complain, there are bigger things to look forward to.
---
It looks great.
---
I made a whole speech to get everyone pumped to go inside and the second it dropped all the comments turned to hatred. Can't wait for what happens when I get everyone pumped for the vaults!
---
Ma Ri 11 17
---
This is genuinely hilarious.
---
I'm sorry but I thought everyone had already learned not to carry so much stimpaks with them in PVP.
---
It's a constant addition, new small things that are permanent. Stuffing the game world. Nothing wrong with that.
---
I know you're joking, but you're also probably right. 
---
There is probably at least 1 challenge in the game to take a photo with your camera during a radstorm.
---
I don't find them that bad but it's also I think cuz a vampires handmade and 3* troubleshooters combat rifle
---
Yeah on the way there I teamed up with a rando and while we were just getting started in it a team of 4 steam rolled ahead of us and we finished before we even reached the final room lol.
---
It's a tie between my TS .50 cal named Ol' Painless and my Zealots weightless minigun named Taggerdy's Revenge.  My quad explosive combat shotgun named Red Mess is a close third.
---
Who enters with 142 stimpacks in survival? 10 it's enought, and no more tan 1000 caps. You can get caps and aids from another players :3
---
Burrows is live? Where?
---
Thanks for letting everyone know you're an asshole. Hopefully your life gets better.
---
Is your 50cal Anti-armor or assassin's?
---
That's on you dude. It's called a stash box for a reason. Smh
---
Haha this!
---
Actually it is constructive. I've seen that plan in action and it worked splendidly. Nothing will teach a creepy straight guy about unwanted advances quite like a 280 lb. gay bear hitting on them. Dude never stepped foot in that bar again.
---
I don't want one shots and I want difficulty.  Maybe a middle ground
---
What a come up
---
Nope thats all
---
Deffinatly not going to argue with someone who obviously has enough free time to sit on reddit and fap it to the comment wars he thinks hes winning...everyone has an opinion, so tell momma to keep the hot pockets coming and try not to pop a blood vessel thinking of a come back
---
I think this is proof they set dailies weeks in advance.   I think they postponed the camera a few days back.   Still not exactly professional to leave it as is.  Especially with their argument of "just get atoms through the game".  I guarantee you that there will be camera related challenges throughout the rest of the week.
---
I have them and I'll be online about 12 et
---
A ameture modder could shit out something better in a day
---
I'll laugh at that while i sit here with my wife and kids. Thanks for the chuckle
---
No, it's still part of BGS, not completely random new studio. And they obviously worked with Maryland studio. I'm sure they'll deliver something better than this later.
---
Guys there's still May's content coming out, which, while it is just a backpack and some other things, is a good stepping off point for Nuclear Winter. Besides you're forgetting the good times Fasnacht brought for all of us
---
I don't know if that was ever really confirmed.  Yes, they are rare, but so are TSEs.  The latter were just duped into oblivion and gave evryone the wrong impression of what "rare" actually means in 76.
---
Yeah? A asshole? Wow? He claimed a ammo factory,  a pvp zone such wow
---
Gee, I hope I never piss you off!  So much fervor!  I love it!  Problem is Recheita, the "griefers" who destroyed Op's camp were only doing what they were allowed to do within the game's mechanics.  This game is complicated that way.  You have to accept that camp smashing is encouraged and has a Perk card for it.  My reply was intended to keep a good intentioned, fun to play with,  person from quitting the game because he was targeted and got disheartened. This is a survival game, even in Adventure mode.  So, for best punishment for "jacking a players dream", I give you a thumbs up!
---
Well yea. I agree that the burrows was half assed and they should of put more time into it (and not talked it up as much) but even so (and I'm sure you've already read this from someone else) it's drip content. But who knows, maybe after all of this backlash, Bethesda will try harder.
---
The camera I feel was just set back so they'd have something to release next week
---
So . . . you never played Skyrim?
---
The same happened to me , in that case the best solution is to change world to avoid saltiness
---
No there were polls. Nobody received one or could confirm proof of one.
---
He
---
Sorry dude i don‚Äôt think I can be on that late
---
Ironic considering this is:

#LEAVE ~~BRITNEY~~ BETHESDA ALONE
---
Post #23456
---
of the last couple days üôÑ
---
I've started an alt after the dupes were closed up, so got them geared purely on drops. With nothing more than a 1 star furious gatling gun, a 1 star furious minigun, and Excavator PA, I blew through the Burrow content at the cost of about 1k rounds and three diluted stims.
---
On the one hand, I did build my perk set well. On the other, I'm not exactly a fresh 50. I would argue that the Burrow content is too easy \*because\* it has to accommodate ungeared, fresh 50's. I am waiting until the Vault content launches before I consider completely giving up on the idea of end game challenges.
---
Sometimes. When you build, you may have the option of building over certain objects like cars or fields. Many times, with large trees that don‚Äôt disappear when you try to build over them, it means that it won‚Äôt work. Might be able to build over it if the tree isn‚Äôt too tall.
---
Short
---
You‚Äôre cute when you‚Äôre mad too ;)
---
It‚Äôs weird because the sheepsquatch event was like the most difficult one ever and this one just takes 5 minutes cause everyone‚Äôs already done it
---
Can I just put the mod on thing I want to mod?!?!!?!
---
Maybe you can catapult them at people? Like that guy did with the cows.
---
Why
---
Oof. Thanks for the reply.
---
Rofl ya that too
---
Bug or feature, you decide!
---
So either next week or the last day of the month
---
I mean, yeah. But the Burrows is one HELL of a good scavenging run
---
I got the mounted wendingo plan
---
Actually yes. You put it perfectly.
---
I took away 4 legendaries from the burrows, the sword, an AA pickaxe, a shitty wood chest piece and a decent unyielding chest piece, as well as 2 level ups. Not great but not bad. Took me longer to find my way out than it did to run it
---
Sounds awesome, and good to see fellow megadeth fans. :)
---
Okay. But why do you feel the need to post this here? I doubt he will read it.
---
I have a feeling that the Burrows is just the first part in a multi-part quest.  I have to wonder what happened at Mosstown now.  They have me curious and have left a hook for another quest/dungeon to come out in a few months possibly.
---
What you are writing is a raid and it's great. It's a little to involved to be just a dungeon. Lots of high stakes going on here.
---
But yet we can find a broken version on dead bodies! Clearly that didn‚Äôt take everything related to it out, I got so excited when I found it. I thought I might be able to repair it or it was needed to craft the working version. But nope it‚Äôs just scrap metal.
---
Also, I'm sorry to have jumped your shit so early. I've been scrolling through the other posts on the sub Reddit, and now I see that your post is not the worst of the hate on the new content lol.
---
Harper's ferry. The symbol is a circle with a water drop. It's a manhole into the sewers :)
---
And laying in bed as well.
---
Is burrows farmable? Like server hopping?
---
They already said 5/7 and backpacks are included with the Pioneer Scouts update on the same day.
---
Why not? Everyone else does similar things. It‚Äôs just because I participated in an aspect of the game isn‚Äôt it?
---
Yeah I can‚Äôt get revenge on this dude he‚Äôs 239. He is harassing me tho. I think he‚Äôs farming me for caps
---
Im just happy to get new content. Endgame is welcomed but they have to cater to new players, and this is a must if we want more people to join this community.
---
Yeah I just did this. I can‚Äôt loose any more caps
---
There's a bug (feature) with workshop PvP where it'll flag you for PvP against the "invader" when they try to take your workshop.  Pops up like a normal defend mission, but says invaders instead of a normal mob type.  The "bug" is that you're flagged for that person all over the map, not just at the workshop so they can initiate invasion, leave the workshop so you "win" the defense, find where you're are on the map and chase you down to kill and scalp caps off of you.  Had someone try that to me last night but they couldn't find me after I crouched and fast traveled away from where I was.
---
I‚Äôm on the same train of thought as you and have scoured Mosstown looking for any kind of lead. Hopefully we aren‚Äôt just being optimistic.
---
Haha okay pal.  So in "your language" they don't use capitals, periods, not text lingo, etc?  Get out of here with that weak ass excuse.
---
Well sure!  Throw in a rifle with a huge crosshair sight while you‚Äôre at it, will ya?  ;)
---
Oof what a bully. Have you tried server hopping to stay away from him? If so does he just keep following you?
---
Why is the new area great?
---
The remaining two sheepsquatch quests came out today; "The Perfect Getaway" and "That Sinking Feeling"
---
Other than that no. The "dungeon" itself is incredibly short
---
fair enough lol
---
But why are you laughing at me? I'm just saying that there should be more ways to spend caps for those that think "caps are useless"
---
If you think of it less as a "dungeon" and more like being lost in an actual sewer, you might enjoy it more. Rely on your compass, keeping a mental map, and reading/remembering signs and landmarks.
---
I thought it was pretty cool.
---
wrxHWKi07
---
I'm on now
---
That sucks... Sorry man.. What a discouragement
---
I appreciate you giving them the benefit of the doubt, but snapping together the pieces of the dungeon, populating with objects and containers, and writing in scripts and triggers for Burrows could not have possibly taken BGS 3 weeks to work on. Modders in the community build dungeons twice the size in under half the time.
---
Darling sisters lab spawns dogs
---
Yeah there isn't much. A lot of people are getting really upset over it because it wasn't what it was talked up to be. But it was just drip content, and there are hopefully bigger and better things coming in the future.
---
Good idea
---
Yea maybe drop some caps. Though you could make it worth it by one of the rewards lots of caps.
---
Because I dont play survival hardly ever and my friends wanted to check it out so I joined them
---
I server hopped. He followed me but he can‚Äôt kill me now cuz I don‚Äôt have a workshop. He‚Äôs actually standing right in front of me spamming the PvP emote. Lmao
---
There was no update today.
---
There's a farm to the far northwest of the map that respawns Wild Mongrels and sometimes even Power Armor in a shack. It's got a dead dude in a bathtub. Can't remember the name of it though.
---
The irony...
---
if you don't already have the first part of the ingredient list, try talking to BIV first, he should give you the spiel about losing the second half in the locked storage room. good luck!
---
cheers
---
Jesus
---
The guy that never plays it
---
Would you fuck me?  I‚Äôd fuck me.
---
Yeah and since there‚Äôs no distinction between caps on your person and your ‚Äúbank account‚Äù, half of all of your caps would discourage a caps economy, which is already too weak.
---
Ouch. Next time pack light :(
---
I haven't found anything. \[Spoilers:\]There's an underwater gate you can open that has a footlocker and med box in it, but didn't find anything worth mentioning in them. There's a bridge that you can extend that didn't seem to lead to anything special, maybe just a good route between N and S areas. There's some raider PA tucked away in a dark watery area. I like whoever does the environment work with the pathways and doors and valves and so on, it's neat exploring the place, but I'm just not finding much.
---
Theres also a cabin on the path from vault 76 towards the overseers camp that spawns 5 or 6 dogs. 
---
Mirelurks you can usually catch in the waters near Grafton Dam.
---
Never played survival and I didn't die in pvp, game glitched and I died
---
I'm not sure if you've seen on Reddit, but it's easily soloable. Makes me sad :(
---
Stash box is almost constantly full, no place to put my gear
---
Lmao at least he can't get you anymore.
---
Yeah now I know, i always thought that i would lose 1 or 2 at a time
---
I really enjoy the Forest but I don't enjoy fighting endless mobs of level 1 dudes that pose no threat.
---
Your/you're have the same sound.
---
Ban op.
---
It's not the same company.  
---
This one's drudging up shit games on an ancient engine because all the programmers are still struggling to learn scratch and can't figure out how to boot up their own wind ws pcs. 
---
Don't expect much ever from fo76.  You won't be disappointed.
---
Ah.  That would explain it.  In that case, bring as little aid inventory that you can and no junk.  Usually, I only bring what I don't care if I lose and only use that amount.  If I end up having too much aid inventory, I dumped it in the stash and keep playing.  I've never had issues coming up negative that way.
---
There are reasonable definitions of p2w that would exclude paid repair kits.
---
What they are definitely *not* is cosmetic only. They do confer a gameplay advantage. Obviously it's not a big one (it saves a bit of tedium of scavenging some resources and finding a workbench to repair at, and you can spend that time doing things like farming legendaries), but it is *an* advantage.
---
Defining Pay to Win is difficult, as reasonable people can disagree at what point a gameplay advantage becomes gamebreaking. But it's very clear what cosmetic only means, so many people take that to be the benchmark for what is an acceptable form of microtransaction in a full price game. People who gave Bethesda money when Bethesda said the microtransactions would be cosmetic only.
---
Ok I‚Äôll get on
---
Well if it takes time and care to be developed why release this kind of half assed content in the first place and not dedicate those resources to the real content
---
For bugs There‚Äôs an event called tea time which usually starts when you fast travel to the giant teapot.
---
Adding insulting to injury, eh?
---
I pm‚Äôd you so we can talk in those
---
Any content is good enough for me. The only issue I have is the over hyping.
---
Seems like you too are an asshole.  It wasn't the fact that they took over a workshop, that is all part of the game. It is the fact that they thought they had to post it here in this sub.
---
Sounds like you know what you're talking about here and I won't debate.  I still stand by my reply.  I really don't see her post as asking for a way to  "teach' anyone anything,  just a good female player trying to diffuse a situation gone out of her control. Down vote again.
---
It's amazing how people still can't figure out "search" in 2019.
---
I hear ya.  So far everything they have put into the game has had a reason.  The room at Tanagra town, the TNT domes, and so on.  
---
The whole game seems to be a huge detective mystery as to what happened before the vault opened.  Even completing the main story there are still questions that we don't have the answers to yet.
---
Dungeons in all games are typically instanced. I have trouble thinking of a single one that is not.
---
That is why it is assumed. Not doing so is just bizarre
---
Aaronholt spelling might be off, but yeah that place us one of my PA parts supply runs.
---
Oh I see ty
---
I need to move my camp... I let a nuke hit it once. At least got enough violet to trick out my excavator armor though ....
---
The quest to uninstall this dumpster fire.
---
You‚Äôre also cute when angry? He take the workshop from you?
---
This is a given... It's bizarre that they didn't make this possible from the get go.
---
I ended up playing it. I ran into 7 charred ghouls and 19 other players. It was like whitesprings on super easy. Really terrible dungeon.
---
Guess you shouldnt have been carrying 142 stimpacks....
---
I would suggest rethinking things then.
---
This entire post seemed completely normal and fun until the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre cute when you‚Äôre angry ;)‚Äù part, which just made it seem more like r/iamverybadass ^^imo
---
Oh shit, that would be crazy
---
No, I don't do pvp. Who said I was angry? You're the one jumping all over me trying to defend your gal pal.
---
I am pretty sure that bgs just pushed something out so they could say that released a dungeon april 16th as advertised.
---
No shit sherlock, didn't think all of them would get dropped
---
Did the were enough?
---
That was it! Thanks Mothman.
---
You‚Äôre funny guy, you‚Äôre upset ids oki move along it‚Äôs a game
---
LOL
---
I didn't whine. I pointed out you didn't know what you're talking about. I'm still not convinced you do since your comprehension is off.
---
But that's 100% on you..
---
The game literally tells you the rules of survival every time you decide to play
---
&gt;It'll be huge
---
Yep, an' Mexico is gonna pay for it.
---
Oh you really think your something dont you. Takes 1/10 of a second to press a button you have 3 on your comment. Well 2 cause they give you a free one. Good job man, you're really crushing it
---
I use lvl 1. I just run through rivers during the day and all I hear is the rad crackle. Heavy rads might build more, but as long as I don't hang out in the rads too long, the lvl 1 clears it really well. I don't have lvl 2, so don't know how much better it would be. I'm also not inclined to level it up because I need the other points.
---
Yeah, recommended at most 10 stimpaks
---
My TSE pump shotty is the Frontier Justice. Gotta stay an Engie main somehow out here.
---
How do you start them?
---
I did two runs and got three three-stars. Two ghouls and one Mr. Gutsy. No others...
---
I‚Äôve been purposefully walking around recently wherever I haven‚Äôt gone. I finally encountered my first Flatwoods monster at the south part of the divide. I was pretty pumped to finally find one! Two shots to the face with my dragon and that‚Äôs all she wrote :)
---
Oh oki. Whatever floats yer boat
---
Maybe they're celebrating 4/20 early?
---
And it in no way shows community opinion. All its shows is somebody pressed a button. Absoulty meaningless and a false sense of accomplishment
---
Descriptive and useful answer gets upvote
---
That‚Äôs a very good point and a view I hadn‚Äôt considered to that extent. It is true that Games these days seem to have a lot of hidden puzzles, or rather the players are hungry for this type of content. In the former case we can take Division 2 as an example of puzzles in games, and we can take Destinys vault of glass Raid as an example in players wanting puzzles in their games (searching for a room that didn‚Äôt exist). 
---
It does seem to be the case that a majority of the quests in Fallout 76 follow the theme of a detective story - and because of that I will continue to search for a lead (regardless of protests offered by my pessimistic mind). Good hunting! I will post here if I find anything.
---
Yo, mod team for this sub. Can we just get a megathread for this type of stuff already?
---
legendary marine armor is sick, got all my pieces with 20% weapon weight reduction ;)
---
The logging camp just to the east of sons of Dane spawns both dogs and bugs. Mirelurks are 100% found around grafton lake near the dam, steel or the river between the camp and the dam.
---
Oh, ok.  I'm PS4 so no-go, but good luck selling it.
---
The only issue is that they over hyped it.  They made it sound like we were really going to need to gear up for this. I honestly would have preferred they just add it into the game without even telling us.
---
Still going but a player has to pay 2k caps every time you want to activate it, after the first time which is free when you're doing the quest originally.
---
2k is quite a bit unless players get organized and split the cost.
---
Technically 100% is still a percent.
---
lol got bored ive just learnt it now
---
Okay. Just... okay.
---
Fully agree about the fast travel but I don't mind the leaderboard so much now you can only get on it by killing other players, I like to look at it like a wanted/bounty system. Also you can get off the leaderboard easily and risk free if you store all your junk and suicide. I use a mod called get lost which removes most map icons meaning your fast travel by is restricted to your camp and events.
---
I just can't get the image of a pa guy punching some poor playboy bunny chick in the ovaries.  
---
Christ.  Hurts my brain.
---
As bad as you enter the burrows ( at least i entered from the South side ) theres a Brotherhood scribe corpse lying on the ground next to the wall. Just retrieve the holotape and u should be fine
---
Get off your PIP BOYS!!!
---
For real. I was taking the munitions factory from somebody the other day. Chameleon armor, hiding on that one steam line or whatever on the roof. You know the one. The guy that owns the faculty is looking for me. 
---
#CONGRATULATIONS
---
Needless to say, the mission was not successful.
---
I got three three-stars in two runs. Though I've read most people are lucky to get one.
---
I hope you get something good.  I'm at level 271 and will probably be over 300 by the time it comes out.
---
I've done 3 queens since the recent patch, 8 level 200+ characters, only managed to get her under 1/2 on the second HP bar once before the time ran out.
---
something crazy has been done with her HP scaling in regards to player levels. 
---
she could be crippled (albeit on a timer) and frozen, unsure if this is the problem, i only recall her being "crippled" once and it was very short vs prior to the patch.
---
My eyes...my eyes!!
---
Tanking multiple pylons, you madman!
---
So as an adult you get your kicks from calling people names on a nameless forum over video games? You sir are crushing life and are my new hero
---
You can start the one at Larry's right at the campsite, the same note can be found in back of a car with the male skeleton
---
Bethesda called it a dungeon.
---
People rightfully interpreted this to mean a large piece of content, since that is what "dungeon" means in every other online game.
---
But what Bethesda really meant is simply a normal underground area.
---
Honestly the long tunnel you go in at the end of the brotherhood quest line is more of a dungeon
---
Right, I agree with that, they aren't cosmetic. They are not P2W tho.
---
yes i run a "random encounter" route through mire and the bog and just found this myself same thing heard kinda sounded likea wierd moose howl and saw the same thing in the pic you showed
---
It was less than 20 minutes that‚Äôs for sure.  And I broke off from my team, stumbled into the final lair, and killed the ‚Äúboss‚Äù on my own without even realizing it was the final part of the dungeon.  When it said ‚Äúquest complete‚Äù, I was like whut...
---
The problem with subscriptions is either all of your friends play, or none of them do. If none of my friends played FO76, I wouldn‚Äôt either. I don‚Äôt know anyone who would have played this for a subscription. I‚Äôm not saying they don‚Äôt exist but none of the six players I run with would be in.
---
way overkill, it was still my fasnacht spam leftovers that i was hoping to burn a solid chunk out of
---
No, your is like y≈çr
---
You're is like yoor 
---
Phonetically...
---
Yeah that is my issue with the past few events. You can get fucked over by something completely out of your control. I spent 40 minutes yesterday server hopping trying to find a server where the encryptid pylons were not on cooldown. Same thing here, I spent like 25 minutes looking for a burrows that wasn't completely wiped out...best I found was when only a level 33 was inside. By the time I finished the quest there were four sets of power armor stomping around there though
---
I hate that I have to run makeshift weapons warrior to use my Grognak axes...
---
I have an Apple Watch. Can confirm that it is physically possible to use the watch while sitting. *Even in those chairs with arms*.
---
Side note, I was super excited to get the watch for my birthday. I wanted to go and open Vault 111 after being in cryo
---
Gotta have some use for my 200 stims! I alternated between spamming multiple stimpacks and supressing the sheep squatch. Which surprisingly let some people survive the hits. My friend has a reflect weapon and runs blocker. I use both the perk and a weapon.
---
Probably, what Im trying to say is that the dungeon flooped, now they could try to hide a quest start or even some clues to junto down a real sheepsquatch, since we know that theres a real one on the game files
---
No. Running smooth all day on PS4.
---
well i wouldn't mind if it was what it is now if  it was just a bit more packed with enemies .
---
How do I start those
---
You‚Äôre asking people to supply a card for you? Wtf
---
Yeah that happened to be the first time. After I hopped and got a fresh one it was a lot more fun. I feel like it if it was instanced it would actually make for a fun farming place with all those 62 ghouls.
---
It‚Äôs interesting that you somehow believe marketing for eso, doom, rage 2, whatever, are somehow halting progress on this game in any way. None of those are worked on by Bethesda game studios.
---
Ok, fair point.  I withdraw the comment and apologize.
---
Same thing. He accosted me in a particularly tense 1v2 sniper battle when I was defending munitions.
---
wahhhhh
---
I mean, if they were super mutants we would get something a bit more difficult, maybe ill nuke the burrows today, just to see how it turns out
---
Looks at SBQ - "How weak do you think we are!?"
---
Looks at SheepS -"1 shot!? How strong  do you think we are !?"
---
Looks at First dungeon for two lvl 50+ 1 shot it solo " How weak do you think we are!?"
---
What level are you guys? My melee guy can 1 hit everything short of SBQ and fake SS. I teamed up with someone to do the burrows and couldn't use any of my melee weapons. Even the garbage 3 star furious pitch fork I've been waiting to get rid of at the legendary vendor.
---
Okay that makes sense then. Do you know if there are more I should look out for?
---
Could have, would have, should have.
---
I am not sure if I am in the same place as most but I am level 192 and I have nothing to do in this game anymore. 
---
Today I was going to be grinding dungeons. The key to dungeons is that they r repeatable. This guest didnt even make sense. I dont feel they put a lot of thought i to it at all.
---
At this point, I really dont think they give a crap to try.
---
well nuking it does make them glowing ones but still not packed with them
---
I call out stupidity when i see it. No reason to let cancer grow.
---
Trust me. It's better not to be mad at that.
---
I don‚Äôt send out that many team invites. If I see a low level having a workshop, and I‚Äôm about to quit for the night, I‚Äôll try to invite to team before I quit so they can inherit my workshops (that are already decked out with a bunch of turrets, so they just have to show up for rewards). I‚Äôm leveling an alt rn, so I try to hold like 5-6 so I can get the defend events to get stimpacks and plans. 
---
I‚Äôve also tried inviting peeps to team up if they are in a crazy far away place and I haven‚Äôt discovered it yet and need to be there. So like the last time someone nuked Watoga, I tried. 
---
So far, no one has accepted :( But I‚Äôll keep trying.
---
Keep on getting downvoted, you know, the sign that the community disagrees with you? Like it or not.
---
Do we know if Bethesda is aware of this bug yet?
---
Hahaha, thinking dev teams are allowed to lay in beds, or sleep... or generally enjoy life. Thats not how creative fields work.
---
üëç
---
worked for me 
---
just need to find a mod to add my playlist
---
I think so. New small content added often, still a fun map amd locations.
---
Have you tried equipping the perk required to craft the mod to equip it?
---
The mod menu no longer lists the perk required, and mods have required a perk to equip them for 5 patches now.
---
These guys keep watching for what we like to do and then nerf it until it's ruined.
---
They've kept shit inv weights, and passed on fixing major bugs, but when bug fixes come they just add a dozen more. 
---
They also fuck with us by teasing new Dlc and item shit that they know will be total crap.
---
They've also lied about the atom atom shop.
---
At this point it should be obvious that, for whatever reason, they actually want to drive this fame into the groundand they're succeeding.
---
1st person view while playing instruments would also be great
---
What platform? If you are on PC, I can give you some cosmetics from the parade event a month ago.
---
Yep, I had put up a house and tore it down a few times until I figured out what I wanted the layout to be. Also had to factor in the space around the house, the entrance and how much room I'd have to walk up to the front door and put things down like crops.
---
The decoration happened more gradually, as I get more and more plans I'm changing things up constantly. I wanna get the new mounted wendigo one day this week.
---
I'm on Xbox sadly
---
Wait until the vault raids! Im a lv 87 but Im keeping all my faith on those vault raids, otherwise we wont have much to do! Until there, lets hope they had some lore and hurry with the sheepsquatch Quest!
---
Thing is it doesn‚Äôt tell you which perks you need since the last patch as well, and I tried at least one combination but it either wasn‚Äôt right or the bug is active there as well.
---
I have a single character and it won't "complete" for me either
---
I'm also wondering what the Burrows Old Tunnel Key is used for.
---
Can still help others that don't know it and could even profit if need be.
---
But why not let you respawn at the location where you died? Presumably a person would like to finish what they were doing before they died, maybe find a workbench.
---
It is if you have the attention span to pay attention to it
---
What about a recon scope? I don't PvP so I don't know if it keeps on a stealthd target
---
And yet you are unwilling to see how stupid you are being as well. Must be great living in ignorance. 
---
And it is DLC by BGS own advertising
---
And are you really ok with a 5 minute mission? Like i understand not liking the way people are posting about it but you can't seriously think this 1 mission is enough compared to how they advertised it
---
So.... same answer I gave this guy...,

Went in at Level 48 with only 3 pieces of Lv.40 gear(including weapon) and 3 pieces of level 20 gear.  Soloed everything easily.  Had everything respawn around me when someone else entered, and kille everything that got in my way again.  A Team showed up and got semi destroyed by the Assaultron, and I wound up helping them a bit.  It was good xp thanks to the Lv.62 Ghouls, but it was boring.
---
Has anyone tested to see if nuking the Harpers Ferry has any affect on the enemies in the Burrow.  Not that it would be much more interesting if it did, but it would give another, better, option to WS.
---
The refresh rate is three hours. People are server hopping like hell to find open one and everyone gets items if we beat him, what's your problem with this strategy?
---
&gt;If you manage to emerge victorious, you‚Äôll receive plenty of loot and experience for your troubles.
---
Except for the named weapon at the end (which is apparently an unmarked legendary) there's really no loot that's in there you can't get anywhere else. It's not a bad area, but to say you get "plenty of loot for your troubles" seems to imply there's something special about it when there's not.
---
Ik! But it has not THAT MUCH but has more ghouls than whitesprings so why not to give it a try!
---
I highly recommend playing this game in waves. I sunk about 100 hours into it soon after launch. I'll come back to it about one year anniversary and have a whole ton of content ready.
---
Sometimes true and sometimes not, I guess
---
Here is Brian Fargo talking about it (~1h:25m)
---
https://youtu.be/XhXTwGUEkjE?t=5161
---
When the old tunnel door hasn't already been opened, it's for that door. If you go in through the south entrance and only make left turns when you have to, you should reach a door that has 'keep out' written near it. It's for that door. (If you're at the terminal that requires a valve to be turned, you've gone through it.)
---
I am trying but today really hurt my heart.
---
I guess he meant that you can have , for example, in the forest low/mid/high level enemies in the same biome. Super Mutants are all mid level across the entire map, scorched are all high level, animal are all low level.
---
In my experience, no, or only slightly. I've gotten small letters from the northern forest junkyard twice. The other rewards do seem to be better from higher level ones, especially experience.
---
We'll bring this up to the devs!
---
Preach
---
&gt; The Burrows is balanced to be a challenge for 2+ level 50+ Vault Dwellers, but truly brave (and well geared) souls may be able to tackle it alone.
---
I went in alone with a non-legendary combat shotgun and no perks. It was difficult but manageable. I'll admit my auto stim armor saved me a few times. Definitely went through a lot of canned dog food and radaway too. 
---
Then again I'm on PC, so it's infinitely easier to kill things. On console with a controller you probably wouldn't be able to do it with just the gear I had
---
If u look at the map..look south of the golfclub there is a snake..hello mirelurks
---
If you get a shotgun with the enforcer perk, you can cripple its wings and make it land
---
If you go into 3rd person before sitting you have free control of the camera, and can zoom in and out if I remember. It bugs out sometimes if the thing you're sitting on is up to a wall.
---
Keep it safe, you cant have a random weapon, dedicate yourself on keeping the strongest weapons with you and while fighting the scorchbeast try not to get on open areas of the map. When they land, give it all you got! But i think your main problem really are the weapons, farm the materials and all but only craft the ammo for your strongest weapons and probably you will do it
---
Well. That sucks.
---
Daily quests in general or cryptid ones? Either way, at the risk of sounding offish, best thing to do is just google Fallout 76 daily quests as it would take writing a whole article. Only Queen of the hunt is cryptid related, off the top of my head.
---
plh is right. I had a mod for the excavator optimize bracer. Like the rest of us I could not equip it. I went and bought the plans and was Able to make one. He‚Äôs already stated the facts.
---
Find a nice big area where they can land and they are more likely to do so. They seem to like to land when you are about a four second sprint away from them. Use a shotgun and vats to cripple their wings, seems to help. Sometimes they never land, though.
---
I got five or six one star legendaries.
---
I would like to be abke to wave or throw the peace sign for the camera in a chair.  Photo ops look boring sitting down.  We all look like we're staring off into space in group settings.
---
You aren't going to FIND it.  You will be BUYING it.
---
also, *were* testing
---
Lakeside cabins defense events seem to be 4 waves of dogs about half of the time.
---
You can try to relocate to a lower level part of the map like the forest or toxic valley. Stay away from fissure sites and stuff.

A big elephant gun as a new weapon class would be great. Make the fire rate and damage fall between the hunting rifle and black powder rifle, and visually make it look like an over-under version of the double-barrel shotgun (same break-open mechanism) and
---
To bad it fucking sucks as was 12 minutes long
---
I would but thats me. I dont need npcs to enjoy this game, the environment tells enough story. for example: a certain place where 5 skeletons are bowing in front of a door and inside the door is a skeleton on a bed with rat poison next to him. (Sorry if spoiler, not really one though) Picture says a thousand words! I let my imagination tell the story. I love the mix of fo4 and new vegas too. Haters gonna hate so i say, more Appalachia for me!
---
How do you open that gate? I couldn't find the right tunnel. Did you hack any of the lvl 3 terminals?
---
That's what it did before this patch, now 76 or sometimes nowhere at all.
---
For your gun do you have any perks associated with it? I mean most guns without the perks or legendary effects will not do effective damage.  What about your armor do you mod it at all to have a little more resistance? What platform do you play on?
---
You‚Äôre expecting someone to bring you a 2k cap worth item for free lol
---
I obviously googled it but only found queen of the hunt. I just didn‚Äôt know if I was missing anything, if there were more quests to do, or if it was a bug. Someone else already helped me with where to look, I just figured I could find specific helpful people on the reddit community. I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs hit or miss with people willing to help or not.
---
I MUST SEE THIS
---
I agree with him and think you are annoying and dumb. :)
---
10 to 20 people is not the community. This sub is not the whole community. And i don't care and it won't change my mind on bit if i had a thousand downvotes. The Burrow is a weak addition to this game and is overly easy
---
Congratulations [Reddit Username Here]! And congratulations on being the [4 digit number] person to make this exact same complaint!
---
Not raining on the parade, but synths and the institute are about 180 years after FO 76 happen.
---
I doubt we'll see them.
---
Why is that pretty weird? Can you do it in any if the other fallout games?
---
Your English comprehension is scary
---
Yes, they told me that they are investigating this issue
---
It's not like u would have gotten anything good from the legendary anyway
---
They play pretty fast and loose with the lore anyways. That armor always look good imo.
---
Ok.
---
It's not DLC dipshit.
---
I think some of this sub is so used to defending the game from criticism they refuse to admit that some criticism is warranted. This underwhelming dungeon is one of those examples
---
And im not suprised at all by the downvotes. The majority of people left in this sub can't handle any criticism of the game
---
U didn't like rose's quest? I was impressed
---
I could have been a conduit like 3 times with that drop.
---
You're right in that what everyone was expecting, but it's not an mmo. I don't believe it was ever designed to be anything more than fo4 with multi-player and a new map. Heck, go watch the e3 reveal again, and its pretty clear that's what they intended the game to be.
---
I dont think everyone is wrong for wanting that, but I do think it's odd that everyone EXPECTED a mmo dungeon. It's fallout. Dungeons are short little forays off the major map. Same with skyrim and things like the dwermer ruins.
---
I think what you are more looking for (and I hope they are making) is the vault raids later on. They didn't use the term dungeon this time. They used raids, which isn't a term used in single player rpgs really. Just my two cents
---
I think it pairs well with suppressor for a support build, as for perks, it was supposed to pair with energy but I think that may still be broken or they changed it.
---
Or just a regular 1* instigating lever action worked for me
---
Fireproof and dense chest armor negate most of the damage from SB's
---
assuming they even playtested it? Bold.
---
Good for you, thanks for sharing
---
Underrated idea, but balancing it would be hard, as high level players tend to have a lot of incentive to let the nuke drop and harvest flux. You could give it huge rewards but I suspect people would start a nuke launch, let their friends kill them, and split the rewards.

If they're treated like Bioware employees that sounds a lot more accurate.
---
Add lsd, pcp, mushrooms no sleep and nonstop nyan cat while playing 76 only pausing for food, power shuts and opening door for takeout. 
---
That is the dream.
---
The level of cringe in this post is mind boggling. Aren't we past this immature stuff yet? 
---
It's free content. Disappointing, possibly. But in the long run people will move on quickly.
---
How much years is fallout 76 after the war ?
---
Why is being able to solo something bad?
---
Init , I literally don‚Äôt know what his point is as the only thing he seems angry about is that the burrows was in the games files ?
---
U sound like a pro..go in Survival
---
There's a valve near it above the water, It's yellow, get out of the water and go up and behind the locked underwater gate like you're trying to get at it from the other side. The valve should be around there. It's hard to describe. (Alternately, if you go in through the south entrance and head towards the pier area by keeping right the whole time that valve should be right up in your face at one point.)
---
I don't have one, just ran with The Fixer. Level 80. Solo'd it ~10 minutes reading the logs. Only challenge was my mismanaged AP usage by jumping. 
---
It's free content...but boy howdy.
---
They are spending all those resources on marketing those games, and this game is broken. That's literally my exact point. If it's not halting progress why isn't anything fixed? Where are all of Bethesda's AAA resources going then?
---
Discord
---
Except the main ones..
---
They advertise it with DLC right in the title
---
25.
---
No. And also no.
---
Good to know, thanks for the info.
---
That's Bethesda programming for u
---
Oh well..
---
Yer I'm doing the two new sheepsquatch side quest and there worth way more more hype than the burrows
---
That was direct xD. Thank you also
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it was nice to have a bit of new area for sure. I will probably be there over elsewhere for a little while. On one hand it is nice that it is soloable, I was just kinda hoping for more interaction with people in a fasnacht like way
---
I really think that this is an easily farmable area, that‚Äôs a bit better than West Tek or WS. 
---
I think they designed this to get rid of the turret camps and whatnot.
---
PLEASE DON'T NUKE THE GOOD BOI!!!
---
Just about the only thing making it a dungeon is that it is cold, wet, and underground haha
---
Pressure switch, so it comes on when someone gets close.
---
I'll bite, what is said build?  Spamming vampire cryolator with suppression perk in T51 I was getting killed almost instantly in melee range.
---
1. Report his bitch ass, he's harassing you, no going around that.
---
2. Tell your other teammates. If they decide to keep playing with this douche nozzle, then you know where they stand, and I would recommend you find new teammates if they do this.
---
3. BLOCK HIM, HONEY. If he can't respect you saying no and to stop, then he has got to go.
---
Are you on Xbox? If so, I'd love to invite you to join me and my group. I'm the only girl, but the rest of them are great guys who were more than willing to talk to a guy who was making me uncomfortable recently (I ended up doing it instead). We would all be down to have you and your husband join us, if he plays too!!
---
Thanks! I'll give it a go!
---
New content.** But I agree, it didn't provide as much as I thought it would. They're slowly rolling these things out which will only make the game better but I wish they would give us something a little more rewarding.
---
I want to believe this but tbh from what we've gotten so far, I'd be setting myself up for disappointment thinking it'll be more than a few short quests with a backpack as the end reward.
---
Ayy that‚Äôs my post
---
You mean glowing boi
---
Is it irredeemable? If they made the area *actually* instanced and say doubled the enemies and octupled the Legendaries, would it be fun? I haven't tried it yet and am genuinely curious.
---
Thats disappointing... I mean 80 atoms is quite a bunch. Sad that it‚Äôs somehow bugged.
---
Got it reversed. People took it the wrong way really.
---
Cmon Bethesda we need more grindy content!
---
Should HAVE.
---
I havent been in game much lately so sorry I cant be more specific!
---
Are you a 10 year old? Did you only read the title of the posts and not the content? Do you always believe everything you read?  Don't be that person.  Get some info and be educated before you post. STOP!  INVESTIGATE!  Misinformation is toxic and only leads to mob mentality and clutter chat of non issues.  PATCH NOTES ARE AVAILABLE!
---
Interesting ritual headpiece is different than the mask
---
How was it btw on a scale of Whitesprings?
---
Not everybody likes mics and I wish they'd take this into account and give us more relevant/useful emotes.
---
It's not incredibly difficult, but you can get rushed by as many as 10 ghouls at once. If you snipe them off or are able to one-shot them, it own't cause too much of an issue
---
I use a zealots Gatling plasma it shreds them
---
Legendary farming is dead and there is no content. After 700 hours of gameplay this last update has me ready to hang it up.
---
Happy birthday dude, and congrats on becoming a dad! You're gonna be on later tonight?
---
Yes but mine were gouls, was just minding my own business crafting in my base took a break to eat then I notice growling and banging outside and well it was 6 gouls attacking it. Note I live on a mountain and I never get attacked usually.
---
People freak out about this game like little babies.  You cant expect every single little free addition to this game to be some brain breaking awesome addition. 
---
Its slowly improving and it seems the only people complaining are go-hards who play the game for hundreds and hundreds of hours
---
WHAT THE SHIT, this explains why i kept having them trickle towards me in my camp
---
I mean, that would be a total chaos but yeah, it could make it feel like the end game experience Bethesda promissed us
---
The institue was still using the first gen synths until the 2170s, but we dont know when they first made them to the best of my knowledge. In all honesty I think it would make some sense for the early institute to send a group of first gen with a scientist to get some research from the area, assuming they didn't already have access to the knowledge. As for the armor we also dont know what time they made the variants so it is possible. I do think the distance might be a problem, because their teleporter only goes as far as their radio signal (if I am remembering correctly)  and the gen 1 synths were not super advanced, so I dont know if they would make the journey or of the institue would find it worth while to travel to west Virginia. In the end it is possible for Beth to bring it, and they did find a plausible way to get the BOS.
---
Thanks man! Its been a crazy year :). I'll be on in about an hour until I fall asleep playing :)
---
Yeah man, it‚Äôs devastating. Can‚Äôt tell if I overhyped it or not...
---
*cries in gieger counter*
---
It reminded me of the fallout 2 Modoc ambient music. Or the music for one of the newer FOnline areas
---
I mean, that would be a total chaos but yeah, it could make it feel like the end game experience Bethesda promissed us.
---
I'm of the impression more cryptid stuff is going to be introduced with each update as 2 new quests seem to have become available today, just not dailies though.
---
 I generally try to be helpful, it's just not always obvious.
---
WAAAAHHHH MY FREE CONTENT ISN'T A FULL LENGTH DLC WAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH &lt;snivels in gamer&gt;
---
Yeah it‚Äôs bad, you will see for yourself.
---
Cool! I'll try and stop by :D
---
Iirc, it's for the camera that was supposed to drop today.
