The Pioneer Scout camp.

---
---
After I got the tadpoles backpack, I noticed there‚Äôs a Possum backpack plan in the scout vending machine, as well as a large capacity mod. Do I need to buy the Possum backpack in order to use the large cap mod?
---
Better off using the ant meat for Rad Ant Lager and getting +50 carry weight instead.
---
Same for PS4?
---
Idk, I don't play PS4 but I assume they would have a way to share screenshots also.
---
Now with 16 times the detail
---
How would ine buy these,  my wife would love these for a x mas gift!
---
I usually send the screenshot to one of my friends in a message and use the PlayStation Messages app to download the photo to my phone
---
If you really want to do it yourself, there's a simple explanation of the process in this post from a while back:

---
But I suspect most people, myself included, can't be arsed and just let Nukacrypt to the work for us. Wonderful site.
---
Damn i have 77
---
I would assume either Dev room or a drop rate so low people don't even know it exists. How much was it sold for and was the person selling it low leveled?
---
3 of them for 40 caps each. The person was under lvl 100, can't remember what level exactly.
---
In that case it's probably a casual who wasn't paying much attention. Might've gotten it from someone who did get it from a Dev room.
---
Yeah, I said on another post they oughta have a Column style and a mothman twig-looking one. I mean they can do it for all the factions, but seeing as how they can do it with the thanksgiving cabinet, we should get stuff like this. And a scrap box and fast travel tent for everybody!!
---
you guys are messed up. it‚Äôs already cramped enough for the npc in there
---
Hmm been a while since I used my quad, I'll test it when I log in later.

They literally show you exactly where to find it before they even allow you to confirm the purchase:

The possum backpack is a skin and not required for the kids afaik

Not gonna lie if you had ended your story with...‚Äùand then the server crashed before I could loot anything‚Äù I would not have been shocked. Lol
---
Try reading the post.  Yeah, it's hating. But it wasn't hating on microtransactions.  Glad to see you take time to consider things before your act, however.
---
I believe that was me that suggested a separate server system for the next phase in rebuilding america post scorched plague.  I can only assume that Wastelanders will be a segway to the scorch free world after seeing the new information.  We'll probably have to find them first in the undergrounds and do some kind of innoculation mission before they come to the surface.  I am guessing that killing the queen would have to come before a new player can access the underground.  My thoughts are that Wastelanders will start out with some kind of evidence of the overseer surviving and hiding in the underground....
---
Agreed.
---
Trade your good weapons for armor
---
No no, I've been away for eight months!  Thanks so much for the help!
---
Do a novice run killing crickets, then repeat. Ignore objectives because they keep respawning for quite a while

Dont forget"StOp TeLlInG PeOpLe HoW tO SpEnD ThEiR MoNeY." Like supporting greedy shit doesnt hurt all consumers by making it a standard practice
---
Wow, that is some amazing art as journals. Reminds me of the Wasteland Survival Guide's style, very nice.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
Unlock all the rad rifle plans! Make a new character to try a different build! I dunno, I love this game, if I get bored for a minute I just FT somewhere I havent been in awhile and fuck around. Go shopping on various servers! Go make some good armor and weapons and bullets and give to some n00bs. Theres plenty of things to do, no idea what you enjoy though.
---
It may be useless to you, but to those who craft most of their ammo, it's hugely important.
---
If you need it for gunpowder, I can hook you up with acid or gunpowder itself. PSN is dtb7591
---
hoe do you het formula p?
---
I straight up uninstalled the game upon figuring this out. And I was one of the die hard fans hoping for the game to really turn around, and telling everyone it would turn around! 
---
Now I just tell them to avoid it. :c
---
haha thanks!
---
from completing the event or legendary enemies while completing?
---
I keep hoping they didn't just mean we have the freedom to purchase it for $49.99
---
Im sure in time well get them :)
---
Racketeering is what they used to call something really similar to this...

You can use the Xbox Dashboard to take a "Screenshot" of your screenshot. You can upload it to OneDrive, or use the xbox app to email yourself the pic
---
Honestly the build is all over the place. You have high endurance while running nerd rage, you are using power patcher/power armour with stealth perks, incisor while also using rifleman perks
---
Completing the event. Took a while to get a full set and its not matching, but has a nice mix of chameleon/sneak/powered/sentinel/cavalier effects plus bonuses like poison resist and underwater breathing.
---
Stings and Things, and Operation Tidy.
---
And everyone on the bus clapped lol
---
Seriously tho, good work üëç
---
Email? Lol its as easy as upload download
---
Yeah
---
It's a p2w item. It shouldn't belong in a subscription or the atom shop.
---
Do you get to learn the color if you scrap it and get to make yellow bats?
---
Well if its p2w and belonged anywhere. It would be a subscription. Lol.
---
Go into the ash heap without a mask. Make sure you let it run its course and don‚Äôt use disease cure.
---
It stays in and you can withdraw, just not deposit
---
Platform?
---
Caps are useless to me, I can donate on xbox
---
So it don‚Äôt goes after it in my normal box space ?
---
Ugh it kills me how much I love 76's environment, it's expanse and diversity, and these awesome effects.  The money grubbing, Atom Shop driven direction of the devs killed the joy of the game for me, but I would love it if Wastelanders changed my mind. Here's hoping!

So it stays infinty space what I collected

If not in nuke or rad heavy areas run armor plated. Obviously Lead lined if rads are more frequent. If im just out exploring i start with armor plated, then as my carry weight gets higher from loot switch to standard then high cap if you want to haul more vendor fodder or even just as a means to be able to fast travel. Just remember to take the high cap backpack off before sqb or sheepsquatch because i tend to forget sometimes and the dr loss is super noticeable especially when running bloodied.
---
Yup stays in your scrapbox
---
If by that you mean experience something that was always intended as an aftermarket add on then yes. You paid for base game and wastelanders when it comes out. At least that's the way theyll tell it
---
3 Queen Run with the Fixins. On the Beth Fallout Forum we run 9 Queen Runs and Ive been Privy to a couple 21 Queen Monster Runs (server Hops mando)
---
You uhh mind translating that to mild average intelligence please lol
---
Totally agreed. ISS and Arktos are good but nowhere nearly as visually epic as fighting the SBQ under a red sky. More boss like the SBQ would be awesome.
---
I don't get how you can accept what Bethesda is doing and be okay with that other than blind fanboyism. Either that or perhaps you are employed with employed with Bethesda.
---
Charging $100 to unlock private servers? Accepting bad practices like that is the reason why devs continue to shit on they're fanbase.
---
It's ok if you like Fallout 76. Accepting bad practices is being purposely blind as if Bethesda can do no wrong.
---
I should do the same ü§Æ

---
+1 for Encryptid, it's a surefire way to see people get killed, hardly anything can kill anyone on this game except that assaultron and firing an explosive energy weapon at face range.
---
Why are you taking a melee perk if you‚Äôre not going to be increasing your strength?
---
You have to pick a focus if you want to be highly effective. 
---
Having said that, if you like a balanced approach, it‚Äôs fine. 
---
What is your endgame goal?  What do you want to be specialized in?
---
I am guessing something is wrong with your machine that you updated on Friday.
---
Bethesda have a Fallout 1st FAQ for a reason.
---
So entitled
---
I honestly use everything and utulize most of everything that passes through my inventory, my endgame goal is to be pretty effective in several aspects not SUPER effrctive at doing one thing... over .. and over.. like i see so many people running around marsupial jumping with a melee weapon lol its so bland and dead to me
---
The files have verified as correct.
---
Just read my mind.  I can do backflips at the pool if it's relevant with all that.
---
Took your advice and it worked immediately. Thank you very much.
---
Huh, played for about 12 hours straight the other day, no issues. Don‚Äôt know what to tell ya

Awesome!üëçüèªüëçüèª

Yep, he also copyright strikes any channel that is critical of him. There are videos exposing him on youtube, look them up.

It's been flawless for the past year, I was one of the "what's everyone complaining about?" crowd, the game would run for 3-4 hours without a problem, be at WS before the nuke hits and grab up all the flux after the nuke clears, but now it's turned to crap.
---
Doesn‚Äôt the revenant card say ‚Äúwhen revived by another Player‚Äù?  Meaning lifesaving and mysterious savior would not count?

Perk card descriptions have been known to be innacurate

Buy Fo4

Try to unlock the silencer mod for radium rifle.
---
Already have it.
---
Thank you that's great info!
---
Cool well it should be easy enough to test - this would be good for one of my builds  -I may try it out with mysterious savior - which I already use sometimes ... just check damage before and after it procs an see if there is an increase üëçüèª I though of this in the past but never tried because of the card description ...
---
Make sure you're always well-rested and use food buffs for extra XP, or just play NW matches constantly.
---
Solo is best enjoyed when you are smacked as fuck
---
I didn't know NW gives you XP.
---
How much does it give you?
---
Those that pay *extra*. The sickest thing about all this is premium games bullshitting with a free to play model.
---
Still haven't fixed laser pistols breaking too fast i see
---
PS4: I screenshot to twitter, save it then upload to Imgur, then post to reddit.   Kind of the long way around but it works.
---
/full agreement
---
Put your base by some good mob spawns and ever time you log in/travel to base kill them all, even the cute snuggly ones. Get all the xp boost cards no matter if you play alone or with others, get them both and put them on accordingly. Another good one is to search out some raid/queen/high level event groups and join when possible, there are some great people out there helping people level up! If you are on xbox I'd even help you out as I have the same problem, my account name is the same here.
---
I'm not on Xbox, but thanks for the advice. :)
---
That depends on how long you can stay alive, but I usually gain a level in Adventure every few matches I play.
---
PC? We can farm some legendaries together if so
---
What‚Äôs so hard about that?
---
I‚Äôd love to build a new camp in the savage valley near whitesprings but I have too much of a sentimental bond with my current shack in the toxic valley I‚Äôve had for a year
---
Well I‚Äôm no expert but I have 6 that I got from something they are really rare and useless.
---
See event log and google the crashing module. Not gonna advise contacting support, I'm not a monster.
---
Darn, well good luck then!
---
Do Uranium Fever event mid map everytime it comes up. 3 legendary spawns. They are level 40 guns but they are still good. Script machine the ones you don't want and then go to berkley springs to spend your scrip on random legenadaries.
---
Player: "is this a bug or feature?"
---
Bethesda: "yes."
---
Other players : "blooper reel."
---
Xbox, unfortunately. I appreciate the offer, though.
---
I don‚Äôt care about reviving the game I just want some new content
---
Thx
---
No just a bad server go to a different one
---
Is that the one underground with the mole miners where you've got to defend the things?
---
Do you like it when ghouls hit you for 60 rads? If the answer is "no" - lead lined.
---
its a bug, a server hop/relaunch should clear it up
---
&gt;my GPU (1080ti)
---
smh
---
Thanks
---
No its not
---
[removed]
---
Oh, well I can do that one. The other I have never been able to complete. It always goes to crap so fast.
---
Thanks for the tip.
---
You own the game, probably have it installed are an experienced player, why are you asking?
---
Double click the Bethesda Launcher or the game Icon and try it.
---
Basically just wait for them to land. Its been said that explosive bait helps to make them land, but idk how much truth there is to it
---
Not mobile friendly indeed!!! Wow.
---
You can sometimes find it at the robot vendors at Whitesprings, as well as grahm
---
been server hopping for quite a while, but cannot find it unfortunately
---
You are not getting the most out of the combat system when you switch around. Best to figure out what you use the most and specialize.
---
You have to go to Microsoft‚Äôs website and log in to your account to see all of your subscriptions. I had to do the same thing to make sure mine didn‚Äôt auto renew, I wish auto renew wasn‚Äôt default.
---
Think of a shotgun as a ranged melee weapon. Keep 1 on you and equip Enforcer to cripple a wing and down them. I carry a bloodied reduced weight pump gun just for bringing one down to me.
---
Watoga shop has it for 11500caps
---
Int gets you 3% extra XP per point, so mentants and broiled scorchbeast brain, ect. (Also unyeilding and low heal gets you 3pts per peice) Cranberry relish10%, always rested. Leader bobble heads. Double XP events rock. Two "easiest" XP farms, IMHO, are whitespring golf club and westek, kill 'em all and server hop, or if you have a friend in server, just log out and back in to respawn them. Go to every SBQ, and tag Everything.
---
Do whatever you want.
---
Issa joke. Relax.
---
Phoenix in Watoga sells it

Yeah, the primary goal was to make the data available. Next step will be to make it pretty. Not everyone is a pro at website design. Someone said you can use desktop mode on mobile chrome and it works that way.
---
I am a culprit but I do try to solo queue most games. I have all the NW perks but I am trying to reach lvl 101 in NW so I can stop the grind. Only 22 levels to go....
---
Scorched sometimes have combat rifles. Lever actions are pretty rare. You are better off crafting them yourself
---
Do you set your PS4 to rest mode or do you shut it down completely? Sometimes if you set your PS4 to rest mode the game has issues signing in, don‚Äôt know why that happens but if you shut it down then power back up it usually sorts out issues for me.
---
I find lever actions from treasure maps sometimes, but I don't know if tracking down maps would be worth it just to find something to scrap.
---
I feel like Honeybeasts drop them, but I'm not sure of that.
---
Accepting that Bethesda does this is almost no different to accepting that Xbox or PlayStation charge you money per month and years to play their games which charge you at least 60$ a pop. Accepting a bad practice doesn‚Äôt make me oblivious or a blind fanboy. I don‚Äôt agree with Bethesda charging me 100$ a year but it‚Äôs not changing my life negatively. I play a game because it‚Äôs fun and enjoyable, not because of a games development and public background or history. A blind fanboy is a person who will blattently defend an action without knowing why they defend it. To put it simply: if it doesn‚Äôt affect me, I‚Äôm  A-okay. Just play the game and ignore the outside stuff, immerse yourself in the world, relax and enjoy what you‚Äôd like. That how I accept it.
---
I agree. Looking back that does appear to be a lie
---
if the wiki was as good as past fallout wiki's, we would have known this
---
I got my first lever off a super mutant behemoth. With some help.
---
What's SBQ and IMHO?
---
Other than that, thanks for the great advice.
---
I heard it's also great to do the Wise Mothman quest as he grants you an extra XP boost when you interact with him.
---
You can get lever action plan at Welch and sometimes lewisberg stations.  Much more reliable than finding them.
---
For combat rifles kill scorched.
---
This wouldn't be a problem if the server can track your progress and place you right back to the last room you were in or simply spawn the cell back with the same conditions met as you had left.
---
I usually find it at the raider vendors at top of the world
---
No worries man it‚Äôs a start.
---
It's good to diversify.  Because, in practice, melee isn't the most efficient means of killing things because you have to physically go up to each target and swat at it.  Keeping a basic firearm on you can help a lot, especially if you're Bloodied, even a Bloodied 10mm comes in handy against Scorchbeasts, Laser Turrets, etc.  As others mentioned, Enforcer is probably the most efficient way to cripple their wings, and all you need is a shotgun (damage doesn't really matter).
---
hmm.this is what I would do. dont take offense if some are obvious I know nothing about you so I am just running from the top on my most usual fixes. 
---
1. reboot pc - test 76 - if good party on. if bad
---
2. check for windows updates security updates, anti virus updates.
---
3. clear all cookies and web browsing history
---
4. in my case I have an AMD vid card I would check that the video settings are correct. ie by default it enables live screen capture which can be accidentally triggered and lags me the fuck out. so i go in and turn off a bunch of crap from time to time. sometimes after a crash the amd software resets my settings to default. 
---
5. run a speed test on my internet connection 
---
6. do a complete hard reboot of my ethernet router. let it stay down a while so that dhcp gives me a new ip address and reroutes me. 
---
servers have been slightly less stable but I have noticed they crash when peeps I suspect of duping are online. so part of the instability may be an uptick in their activity. I cant call names here but I play in the same time frames consistently and if I see certain players I know servers will crash soon. these guys typically kill the queen in less than a couple minutes with legacy 2 shot explosive plasma gats as a team. they then run around the rad zone for a bit collecting resources. then they gather at the survival tents, then the servers crash. not sure how or what they're doing. that shit happens like clockwork every morning I get on a server with them. boom 3 queens check, rad zone farm . check. aaaaand  server crash check. 
---
I have been running into unkillable enemies lately as well. and also just over all randomly horrifically tough fight scenerios from time to time. insanely high spawn rates and even though the damage numbers for my laser gat display correctly it seems like everything is dying slower.( less gun nerfy more creature buffed feeling.)  actually failed 2 queen fights recently which is not normal. I can solo the queen on private. and normally I don't die but I even had 2 deaths this last week. 
---
So I am definately gonna say some things have changed but most of your post makes me think its something with your pc.
---
Thank you for the wallpapers. I have been wanting to do something like this myself but dont have the patience. Tysm for your time &amp; effort!
---
You want to use heavy guns if you‚Äôre wanting to play in power armor.  Get a decent Gatling for day to day, and a good LMG or Minigun for bosses.  A Supersledge or Grognak‚Äôs Axe if you want to melee too.
---
No, that Uranium Fever is the one where you defend the extractors against the mole miners.
---
Yes it is that one.  The issue is you‚Äôll only get level 40 max loot.  So it‚Äôs only good for scrip.
---
I loves this spot after just wandering and finding it. Too bad it became popular and I eventually moved because of it.
---
I had a three star legendary Gatling gun, but it didn't kill for crap. I think it was a two-shot, too. That's the only reason I don't have one now. I was doing better with a handmade.
---
That's unfortunate.
---
Oh. Darn it. I guess scrips are better than nothing.
---
If you play in a team rank 3 Inspirational (Charisma) will give you 15% XP.
---
I'd be happy with armor stands that display pa
---
I was in a  similar boat. 500 bours in at about your level. It didn't bother me so why does it bother you? Any level after 100 is kinda irrelevant anyways. We both played for fun, not to grind right? So don't be self conscious because no one really cares what your level is.
---
it didn‚Äôt work. thank you though. just wish Bethesda would sort the issue out. i was having a lot of fun with the game
---
Nice, I would also like to have a mercenary NPC I can hire to defend my camp lol
---
Go to the mire with a teammate. Work your way down the map. You're welcome!
---
What do your special perks look like? What‚Äôs your build
---
Two shot is a below average prefix, despite what others may tell you. If you want to do lots of damage, go bloodied.  If you want to play full health, then Anti Armor, Vampires, Furious, Junkies are your best bets for prefixes.  For the Gatling, I‚Äôd try to find instigating.  If your build is solid, the Instigating Gatling will 1-shot 99% of mobs. If you go bloodied, obviously get a bloodied Gatling. 
---
A heavy build is VERY strong, but it does use a lot of ammo (besides the Gatling, which is why I recommend it). If you get a good LMG or Gatling, you will do crazy damage on bosses.  With a BE LMG or Gatling you can do 80K damage during the SBQ by yourself.  If you can get your hands on a legacy Gatling plasma, you become basically a god (until you blow yourself up).
---
76 is like an abusive spouse. You know it's not a healthy relationship, but you keep coming back.
---
I really enjoy bugging guys like you
---
Thank you for clarifying. 
---
By any chance does this mean that they have fixed workshops?
---
That. That is the best way to describe it
---
Not very often. No real need to tbh.
---
"boil water? What am I a chemist?"
---
I have the fixer plan. They usually sell for up to 15k caps, in case you didn‚Äôt know.
---
Well said. I believe the junk weights and some other items are artificially inflated to entice users to purchase fo1st so they can pay to have fun, not pay to win.
---
...um yes it is
---
Equip the Fireproof perk against their damage from the air.  I use the 1st level and it seems to not bother me much.
---
A shared stash between account would be nice, like in Destiny.
---
I DONT KNOWWWW
---
Then what do you find fun
---
That‚Äôs what it ultimately comes down to. Pay to have fun
---
oi mate the queen then i, yeah
---
&gt;By any chance does this mean that they have fixed workshops?
---
What do you mean?
---
I am available to run it with you all. GT: ZeRoPiXeLs4life

---
Ok, I'll add you. Haven't heard from the other guy yet. Will message you.
---
Youre safe from thievery. If you turn pacifist mode on, your camp is fine. Just dont mess with anyone elses.
---
I have tried this personally and its weird. Sometimes it works like a charm, and sometimes its a complete miss. From what i can tell there isnt really any indication before combat starts if its going to work or not either. What I can tell though, is if it doesnt work the first time secondary attempts dont either.
---
You've got great composition. Those are fantastic.
---
I enjoy the grind of finding/trading/buying. I put a lot of time into my junkies heavy/explosive build. Exploding LMG +HMG+Gatling Gun, Quad Gamma for PVP, a decent set of Vanguard Heavy Leather... Also, I can play online with my IRL BFF who lives out of town. Player vendors make the game for me, I also enjoy the odd chance that someone initiates PVP and I get to melt them.
---
It balanced out 200+ upvotes now... nice!
---
Haven‚Äôt tried it yet, I plan to but haven‚Äôt gotten around to it yet. It would be good if you wanted to majorly farm legendaries ...
---
Nice! Liking the openness of the game
---
Class Freak is the name of it. No clue on the level requirement. Strange in numbers is nice to have for occasional use but I personally dont run with it on all the time.
---
I can't explain it either, yes its still buggy &amp; I still play everyday &amp; have put more than 1700 hours into it.
---
For me - "it just works" :)
---
Well do think stuff that was going to be free you now have to pay for is fine for a game still broken
---
Is it in charisma, and why don‚Äôt u use it all the time
---
#5 is weak, the rest I can get behind
---
Piggybacking on this - I've got the platinum trophy for FO76, and I didn't have to boost revives. All of them came naturally from things like SBQ and other events. (SBQ especially, since that tends to draw everyone out of the woodworks, whereas people have started to wise up about how friggin' tough Encryptid is.)
---
I agree it‚Äôs buggy I seeing how buggy it is by taking clips of ever bug for minor to major i think the worse we ran into we where taking a power plant it is the one farther north and we got a bug where all the super mutants and ghouls where 48-68 the 2 of us where level 17 we spent 2 hours clearing the wave of ghouls the last one got inside and glitched ai ant damage you did it would regenerate unless you kept firing that was almost the breaking point for us
---
I use class freak all the time(thats in luck). but Strange in Numbers is really only useful when with a group, and a good majority of the time Im flying solo.
---
Negligible?  I‚Äôm not trading my max level gear for lower level gear. It does do significantly less damage, breaks more quickly, etc.  I‚Äôm not saying a level 35 Bloodied Explosive Handmade isn‚Äôt useful until you find a level 45, but no top-tier player is running around with a level 35 gun after they hit level 100.  
---
The only Uranium Fever weapons I don‚Äôt scrap are ‚Äúgod tier‚Äù ones.  And I only save those for low level alts.  They have significantly lower value.  
---
That said, I do Uranium Fever as often as possible for the scrip, steel, etc.  
---
The best way for him to get good gear is by server hopping and finding rare and undervalued weapons in other players vendors.  You can find stuff like the 3* J25 handmade I bought for 1K yesterday, and trade that for a weapon that works for his build.  You most definitely aren‚Äôt going to find stuff like that in Uranium Fever.
---
My best advice is to earn some caps and trade your way up to useful ‚Äúgod tier‚Äù gear.  It‚Äôs really not that hard, once you get a feel for the value of gear in the game.

Am I the only person who farms water? 280 purified water a day is 1,400 caps at the vendor.. Find a site my a large water source and lay down 10-12 large purifiers.. Maybe even some of the ground based ones.. I have enough water to max the vendor for me and my fiance each day. It does depend on how much you play and how often you return to camp and collect.
---
Ohh ok that makes sense, thanx man
---
don‚Äôt take it personally
---
I‚Äôd like it to be free, but almost nothing is free anymore. It is only like 50 cents/day. Although the game has many flaws, I still enjoy it.
---
This. You can easily farm combat rifles from higher level scorched. Lever actions? Buy the plan and craft/scrap them...it's much faster.
---
I don't really have one. Most of my stats are in strength and intelligence.
---
I agree 59 cents a day isn‚Äôt bad but the fact it‚Äôs a 156 usd a year is insane for game with no major updates (that the community wanted) for a yeast
---
Put a dense mod on your chest peice the scortch beast scream will no longer do damage to u
---
Melee is a solid choice if you commit to it, but if you want to use guns, heavy weapons are the answer. Your best grinding options are Whitespring, West Tek, Cranberry Bog, and any event that guarantees a legendary. In that regard, sell legendary's for scrip and hit up the legendary vendor. 
---
If that's still challenging, sell the loot you find so you can save up and shop player vendors. You can find a lot of good stuff at a good price if your're patient. Pro tip: Most high level vendors sell cheap. They typically have everything they need and understand the economy, so they won't poach you. I do. Caps only go so far.
---
As for guns, I would say the Gatling plasma and .50 cal are the best, but you can easily wreck shop with any other heavy gun. While popular, my least favorite is the Gatling gun. I like the minigun even though its damage is less than others. The LMG is an absolute beast, but you need to reload constantly. It just depends on what feels good to you and what makes you happy.
---
Either way, aside from the essential damage perks, Stabilized is a necessary perk.
---
You get golden perk cards I think
---
I play because it's enjoyable and has the best trading system in any game. Let's be honest, trading saved this game. It's fun farming for stuff you can use to trade with. I also have a lot of fun with the building system, I make little towns. The content they've added is pretty good but can't wait to see what Wastelanders brings
---
Welcome to the wasteland!
---
I disagree with best trading in any game but trading did pull the game back a but also let‚Äôs hope wastelanders for February
---
This is how you earn your stripes. Welcome to the club!
---
People not being able to buy things from your vendor if there is no power to them. I don't have the build space to lock my vendor machines behind doors.
---
The only reward is regret buying it
---
Rub your Butt on the carpet.
---
I just enjoy role playing a survivor.
---
Those are amazing! 
---
you should definitely look to have them publish or maybe make your own book/magazine with something like [blurb.com](https://www.blurb.com/formats) 
---
... imagine ... if people are buying 18$ digital colours they may just be willing to buy something actually original and worth it!
---
What‚Äôs your players back story
---
The multiple blank wikis are the bane of my existence.
---
Bloodied builds need protection from rads the most. When you're sitting at 19%, a few rads means death.
---
Thank you for the feedback friend! I guess I‚Äôll have to roll another one hopefully :)
---
*yawn*
---
Sounds like what I was doing a year ago.
---
No, the sickest thing is they promised all future DLC/content will be free. 
---
But hey, I guess unlimited junk storage, a feature we have asked for since launch, isn't either one of those things.
---
It does help get rid of rads, but it lowers your resistance 50% to disease. You can go into the Effects tab and see what different drugs, foods, and mutations do.
---
I like re-exploring areas and finding notes, holotapes and bits of lore that I missed the first time around. I also enjoy the grinding. Between the resource harvesting, cap and scrip grind daily/weekly atom quests, and daily/event quests there is something to do everyday with enough variation to not get super stale but still be simple enough to listen to a podcast or music while doing it. Additionally, even though a lot of weapons aren‚Äôt really viable I still like to take some of the more interesting things I get from Murmrgh and try them out on weaker enemies and see how far I can get with them. There‚Äôs something really satisfying about killing a clumped up group of enemies with a fatman. I also renovate my camp about once a month. As for things that I‚Äôm hoping for, I hope for more side quests and for event/dailies to be fleshed out a bit more. I think it would be cool if you could compete them in different ways based on your Special stats. I also hope the scrapbox and tent are provided for other players eventually. Some creature balancing would also be nice, seems like some rip through my health while others barely do anything. Creatures also need some sort of vertical mobility because a lot of them can‚Äôt handle small steps or drops. It‚Äôs been said a million times but some form of text chat would be pleasant.
---
My girlfriend. She loves the game and I like the building aspect of it.
---
Honestly, this game is buggy and annoying at times but I can get past it because there‚Äôs not many games like it. I don‚Äôt respect the customer support or Bethesda but I guess I‚Äôll ride it out..
---
The ranger outfit should be free too.
---
I want to thank everyone for the tips, I will look into the things mentioned here and see what i like best. Especially interested in the dense mod and fireproof perk. Had no idea that worked on their screeches.
---
yea the whitesprings can be a tough area
---
No I'm joking it just seems that I keep getting rad worms. You can go to the gazebo near the whitespring golf club house and drink from the water fountain to clear all diseases
---
No problem buddy!! You could always try the encrypted event again with some random players and hopefully you get a fixer plan!! Then you are 15k caps richer!!
---
That doesn't make any sense. That would cause a whole host of problems.
---
Citation?
---
Why are all your posts advertising based?
---
So my biggest question is is it bad to have rads on your health? I‚Äôm new to the FO franchise so I‚Äôm not sure how the mechanics work for this game. Whenever I see the slightest bit of red on my health I get rid of it. Is that bad? I know you can mutate but isn‚Äôt that bad? (In real life it would be bad so that‚Äôs why I assume it would be bad in this game lmao)
---
The build is really fun I will agree but with the bugs and on Xbox the frame rate makes bugs worse because you can‚Äôt even tell what‚Äôs going on
---
What causes new/reworked interiors to show as inaccessible then?
---
Thing is Wastelanders was a DLC they barely had a trailer for by the time E3 hit, whilst Nuclear Winter was a mode they already had and enjoyed in the office.
---
I saw a 76 themed charging dock for Xbox on Amazon for a lightning sale. 1% of them were claimed.
---
It's probably more just people that have already been playing the game who are so bored with the actual content that they're just cheating to buff experience for unlocks. I don't at all condone such behavior, but that's my theory.
---
I did a lone wolf character for a couple days. No CAMPs, no buying/selling, no legendaries, and no stash. Only what you can craft/carry.
---
See, yes!!!  Awesome.
---
I do, i have a nice little collection sitting about
---
But how can the scrapbox store unlimited junk
---
Added
---
I will have to verify that myself. I haven't encountered that many hackers when playing in general. I guess the shoot-through-walls ones are the worst. I once encountered two guys teleporting around. Too bad for them, they were not impervious to bullets ;)
---
Dunno, level 188 and i login, grind the same spots mostly, visit people's shops to see what's going on, and continue to sell out of my own when i'm not capped out. This is the closest we're gonna get to a fallout game for what i feel is a long time so might as well enjoy it, while i say that, i do highly enjoy it and play every day, happily.
---
Hi mate, I do. I am selling for 5k. I will be on later though. Lmk
---
I hope the next has small scale multiplayer but like borderlands does it
---
First image I've found since having my phone that has me changing the Alliance symbol on my lock screen. All great shots.
---
Is there a way to steady the gun, I found this was a bit wild to control.
---
This sounds intriguing...
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I was in either this match or a similar (on xbox) I was chilling some nukes I fought the boss, wasted over 2000 rounds of 556 for my explosive ar (a waste lol) and had no materials to make any more like 20 minutes later another nuke, couldn't fight her then 20 minutes later another one
---
Something I‚Äôd like to see is an account stash box, that‚Äôs universal to all characters on an account, even if it was only 100lb limit just to pass on various things to your different characters. 
---
Playing with my other character would be awesome too, as one is pure melee and the other ranged
---
Bloom, ok. Yeah it messed with me too much. I tried to disable it but at the time I couldn't. Maybe now it can be fixed? idk. 
---
I don't really wana start over though. oh well.
---
Magic. No bit nonsense here. The scrapbox is just plain magic.
---
Easy. But how much will it cost in the Atom shop?
---
I rarely encounter hackers, but I guess the shoot-through-walls ones are the worst. I created a Storm Walker character. I am able to look for loot, briefcases and codes hidden within the fire storm, survive in it a lot longer, hack terminals and sneak around, sometimes hiding in plain sight, avoiding direct confrontation. I'm like a lonely ghoul that prefers to wipe out entire teams with a push of a single nuclear button. It's a lot of fun :)
---
Someone nuked WS while I was up there, so when I was done I equipped lvl3 glow sights for increased damage to glowing ghouls and went to the closest house to see what I thought.
---
First ghoul I saw I walked a easy 4-5 round burst up it's torso that terminated in a weakspot head shot for over 1k. I literally started laughing out loud. While I've had shots over 1k before, those were semi-auto weapons, crit shots and the like. Never had something with the LMG's lower level of damage per shot hit that hard before.
---
I have never launched a nuke in nw what‚Äôs it like
---
ADS I find it pretty damn accurate. Really wish it had a reflex sight option though. Burst fire is key though.
---
Well it is the how  Bethesda's been over the last year, so it could go either way :-(
---
haven't played borderlands but i miss the "fallout" feel, there being an actual story and different ways to approach it, the hopeless looks to environments and whatnot.
---
So how borderlands is the more people the higher level/ hp enemy has but you slightly better loot how I hope it works is you can have companions but you can also have friends but you must chose also borderlands is not good sub for fallout us it good yes but not if your looking a fallout sub
---
&gt; Maybe now it can be fixed? 
---
very unlikely :/
---
You basically need a nuclear briefcase and four nuke codes, which allows you to nuke a small area of the map within 15 seconds from initiating the sequence. If a player is in the very center of the blast zone they have no chance of avoiding death. It feels satisfying to see so many players wiped out in a single strike :)
---
Looking back my best memories of when I used to play this was when I was higher than a motherfucker
---
I had the brief case and 3 codes I grabbed the las one and got snipped
---
Why?
---
What possible use could you or anyone else have for "300k+ last weekend alone"? What is there in the game that is worth buying with all those caps? Once you have your ideal loadout of armor and weapons, what are you doing with your money?
---
Yeah, it has damn good range
---
That‚Äôs a bit to steep for me rn haha. ill Pay you 2k caps to build it at my camp?
---
It‚Äôs Fallout.
---
It really isn‚Äôt though
---
Username checks out

Andrew Stephens:
---
Born in the vault, only knowledge of the past world before the bombs dropped came from the romanticized recounts of older vault dweller, A world he wanted to see and bring back. His Father, Peter (an anchorage Veteran) and Mother, Claira (a survivalist) provided Andrew with training supplemental to that what Vault-tec already provided. 
---
     Andrew now lives a reclusive life post vault exodus. Deathclaw, Super Mutants, ghouls, and the Scorch all have taken their toll on Andrew, the most Taxing though were former fellow Vault dwellers. Desperation can change people, a life lesson that came at the cost of his parent who were killed by people Andrew once thought were friends and allies in Reclaiming America. Gone are the stary eyed dreams of youth, of exploration, of Reclamation. Survival is all that is left.
---
No Worries! I‚Äôll gladly build it for you for 2k. What‚Äôs you GT?
---
You mean using a weapon from the unarmed class, right? It's no wonder it took so long if you were using your bare knuckles.
---
Same as boo, never seen or heard of these!
---
But think about it where is the interesting npcs changing story mysteries locations where the farther you go in the more you uncover it really isn‚Äôt a true fallout game
---
Mine is I killed a guy took his id and now are him also I ugly as all hell
---
Ikr üòÇpeople are making me feel stupid
---
This is so weird
---
There‚Äôs nothing to do but grind at that point, unless you enjoy making a new character, shopping for better things, role playing
---
High capacity is terrible for a bloodied build. Armored or lead lined(?) are useful, but honestly, anymore I keep the refrigerated on 98% of the time. Keeps my flux and corn soup noce and frosty.
---
Where was the 8th pic taken? I thought I'd been all over the wasteland but apparently not..
---
i like a challenge, the idea of that sounds good but yeah, i looked into it and couldn't really find it worth playing personally
---
To obtain best in slot gear it would cost you nearly 1 million currency.  And I‚Äôm referring to items such as ‚Äú Quad FFR FR Tesla rifles which alone can run up to 400k on the PS4 platform for just the gun with those god rolls. 
---
Like any mmo once reaching end game content there isn‚Äôt much left to do but trade and collect best in slot items for something to do as well as gear your char with the best items. 
---
Go and try and grab yourself the Tesla gun I just mentioned up above and you‚Äôll answer your own question.
---
Better that, go and try and gear your character up with a full set of bos Unyielding / powered / Sentinel and let me know if you get even one piece that has all 3 stats on one with out having all this ‚Äú currency ‚Äú I just spoke about. 
---
Goodluck. 
---
But, that‚Äôs not to say you need to have all the best gear.  You can have plenty of fun doing other things. Unfortunately since there isn‚Äôt much content out right now for veteran players it‚Äôs really all there is to do most of the time to stay entertained. To be honest though, trading and vendor hopping is my favourite thing to do as well as farm god tier roll legendaries. 
---
Like I stated up above though. Go take a peak on the fallout 76 trading forum in reddit and browse the asking prices of those impossible to find items. It‚Äôll surely answer your questions lol. I‚Äôm just giving advice on how to obtain a worthy amount of caps since not many people share that knowledge.
---
You can‚Äôt unfortunately they‚Äôll have to add that soon I‚Äôm sure
---
I‚Äôll build it at your camp for free if you want
---
I think level should play so you have level 200 carry you
---
I don't know about this.  Is that a mod?
---
I found a fixer plan in a player vending machine today for 220 caps I almost fell out of my chair buying it and learned it right away hoping the game didn‚Äôt crash, was like winning the lottery
---
Will be bonding with this weapon!
---
Sorry didn‚Äôt reply directly. Yeah I will do that for you!
---
That would be really appreciated! I just got back into this game and I don‚Äôt want to go broke so quick haha. My gt is: Chippin In.
---
Alright I‚Äôm coming :)
---
Yep, pretty much, with the exception of those of us which force it upon ourselves via survival mode/realism mods. I think I lowered my carry weight in my FO4 runs to 120, but even then workshops allowed unlimited storage.
---
It‚Äôs not letting me post it
---
Thank you
---
Level 366 on my main, been playing since beta, I have to give you my gaming experiences/ cred so you can see from my perspective. 
---
I have been pc gaming since 1990....something. I started console gaming, and table top dnd in the original atari days as a kid, grew out of that and started pc gaming around 1993 94 ish. 
---
all shooters are the same for me. battlefield, cod, halo,.
---
all sword and board are the same,ultima one, Diablo,  skyrim, dnd WoW, Guild wars. 
---
no matter how well done a game can be. chances are I have already done it in a different skin. even the newest greatest bestest versions of most games. they just dont offer a unique experience. thats not to say I wouldnt have fun playing the next version of halo. I probably would. once. 
---
out of everything on the market the most recent games I played that most gave me a unique and fun experience were ARK, Sea of Theives, and Fallout 76. 
---
of those three sea of theives I burnt out on fairly fast. the ships and sailing were great the pvp was great but at the end of the day theres only so much sailing you can do. 
---
Ark lasted me a couple thousand hours. extremely good game in my opinion and if I ever leave 76 thats most likely the one I will go back to. that being said if I do go back I will be using bird and rifles only. I got pretty tired of the care and feeding of a massive base and all the land walker dinos after a bit.
---
Which brings me to 76. I am already ticking over 1700 hours. my main has been "complete" for 200 levels. I still keep logging back in and I am looking forward to logging in as soon as I get home from work in the morning. 
---
1. the CAMP system is unique among all games. its a little touchy with the building mechanics and the budget etc but my most recent CAMP creation is in the form of an airship. it took me 12 hours to put together and I probably put 40 hours worth of materials into it. it was a frustrating, time consuming pain in the ass. holy shit its awesome to look at now though. people come to my camp and I watch them circle it to just look at it. I get heart emojis, I have had people come on area chat just to tell me how awesome it is. Aside from all the compliments even if no one else liked my airship. I would. its like looking at my ninja 300 in real life. I look at it and think "that shit is cool" every time. harley riders look at it and curl their lip in distaste. do I give a single fuck ? hell no my motorcycle is cool now and always in my mind. the same goes for my airship. that shit is cool. as far as I know I couldn't have built that in any other game. (ark I had a cool ass raft though. I loved that mother fucker too.) 
---
2. on my main I have been in a final state of "almost done" for 200 levels...and I am still tweaking. my main began as a stealth sniper, then commando, then PA fat boy sniper, then 2h pa melee explosives, then when trying to shoot down a drone with  rocket launcher I got disappointed as hell and used a laser gatling which I wasnt even specced for. holy shit it was love at first trigger pull. then I got a vampiric laser gat. oooooooooooooh then I got a junkies ultracite laser gat and respecced for that. then I found a vampiric ultracite laser gat and went back, then recently I have been having these weird occurances where mobs are just far tougher than usual and my vampiric ultra feels too weak in the damage department. so now I am in the process of gathering all the drugs I need to get properly addicted and I will be looking out on the market for an junkies ultracite laser gat. I expect to be swapped back over to junkies ultracite in a few days to a weak at most. I wish I had kept my old weapon but I needed space and I was SURE I was done for real this time. Vampiric ultracite is on the lower end of the high damage spectrum, I feel like the low maintainance more than makes up for the slightly slower kill speed. however since that last patch it has felt like some of the mobs just got a lot tougher both in the silo and in some of the queen fights. I dont know if its a game change or a bug or some rando popping forumla P or what. I do know I failed the first queen fight in AGES yesterday. for the first time in a very long time I didnt feel like it was possible for me to solo her. the adds were insane as well. the damage numbers on my weapons were showing the same but the mobs just seemed to have much larger health pools, I died once even. you have to understand I havent been doing hardly any of that dying business since the last big issue they had with the dead zones that just killed you when you walked into them. I have probably died once or twice in the past 3 months. usually those deaths are from me doing something stupid. we just straight up got our ass kicked at that queen fight. Fine then back to junkies for me. 
---
3. there's more but I have already written an essay you probably wont read. in summary for me fallout 76 "just works"  todd wasnt lying lol.
---
This could be its own post
---
Anyone else waiting for that movie? "For Appalachia" now THATS something that could be used
---
Looks like it was dumped in sulfuric acid, I‚Äôd imagine that would be pretty effective against tires.
---
hey you should share these with Nate, the lead artist for 76. He's pretty active on the tweets.
---
 [https://twitter.com/NPurkeypile](https://twitter.com/NPurkeypile)
---
That‚Äôs not true there are atom shop items for them
---
I was just saying this the other day! Armor/clothing displays and power armor displays! I would love to be able to collect all my power armor and put it on display!
---
i did the same yesterday, it took all day to download and i‚Äôm working today but as soon as i‚Äôm home it‚Äôs go time!
---
I did though? they're on [lulu.com](https://lulu.com) print on demand stuff.
---
Cool! What‚Äôs your GT?
---
Beastboy lol I‚Äôm here
---
the low low price of zero atoms.
---
So a regular Tuesday over in the Cranberry bog. ;P
---
Your welcome :)
---
I love this idea.
---
Yeah, a lot of people stop by my CAMP and buy things. I'm actually thinking about changing it into a medicine and food shop. Right now I sell a bit of everything. I'm near the Overseer's CAMP. I like making things and giving them to the lower level players that come through.
---
Yeah, I agree. Frame rate really screws you when you‚Äôre in a fight and my game crashes sometimes.
---
I‚Äôm actually having issues logging in, I had to find a work around after 5 months of submitting tickets without help. I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs the frame rate and my saved data but yeah, game is buggy.
---
So... with 2 calibrated shocks legs you should normally have +200 carry weight? I have them, but, still have this glitchy behavior.
---
been seeing these more and more lately, nice.
---
How bout make recipes with purified water instead of boiled water as well.
---
thats some damn good photography
---
"It'll cost MILLIONS!!!!! to get the ideal loadout!!!" 
---
Okay, then. The question, however, was "What do you do with the caps AFTER you have the ideal loadout?". If you did, as you totally didn't brag earlier, make 300K+ last weekend then surely you would already have the perfect loadout. You would already have made enough by now. 
---
As for a Quad FFR FR Tesla "answering my question", I've used a few Tesla Rifles. I don't think I have ever said to myself "Wow, If this had more capacity. fired faster and reloaded faster it would be the best ever!!!". I think I'll stick to my BE .50 cal.
---
As a melee peasant myself, I don‚Äôt need a mcguffin to force the scorchbeasts to land. They usually land quickly for me 70% of the time. When they don‚Äôt, I just have a smoke behind cover until they are ready to dance with me on the ground.
---
The community is the only reason I want to reinstall the game. 76 has probably my favorite gaming community. The game even has its moments where I have a lot of fun. But it‚Äôs bugs and Bethesda‚Äôs decisions for it have completely ruined it for me. I just can‚Äôt support them as a company anymore, but I certainly don‚Äôt begrudge those who stick around though.
---
Where is this on the map?
---
They both have value more so the railway rifle since it is a FFR. The gamma might be better off as scrip but idk for certain since it is bloodied.
---
You'll get 12$ worth. Good thing g you didn't get it at 60 because that's not worth it.
---
Why does the Mail system need Call Of Duty functionality? Seems like a lot of work for the devs to add that to a mail system.
---
Yeah..I had over 1,000 hours. Was level 274. With other characters also up to level 30 and on average.
---
I'd trade, farm, everyday. It was all I played for months. Been playing since beta.
---
Got super nervous when scrap bot came out, and fridge.
---
Got disheartened when the reddit changed its tune about these items in less than a day from rage to straight up defense. Got disappointed. Played A Bit less. I've seen the slippery slope before. 
---
Then this came out. I've uninstalled. I'm now playing borderlands/outer world's/and have revised fo4 with a whole new appreciation.
---
The atom store has a headstone and guts. You missed the Halloween one, but I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs a Thanksgiving themed ones.
---
nice, I just saw the link in another comment, great stuff!
---
(on a side note, maybe you could put the link to your lulu page in the main post ... if that doesn't break reddit guidelines for self-promotion).
---
Grinding towards Vault rewards now, just completed my first run on standard.
---
A group gets together and does 3 nukes like you just saw. Another common thing is to follow that up with a run of Encryptid. Then everyone hops to another server and does it again. Do it 7 times and you get 21 queens.
---
[everyone disliked that]
---
Dust in the wind
---
I used to have my camp under there back in the survival days, good shit
---
Wait, the stash box junk is inaccessible until you pay again, as in it all goes away? If that‚Äôs true i‚Äôm uninstalling right now
---
Nps, if you have one of those silly looking terminals at your camp you can start the quests from there.
---

Yeah i love these nuke marathons XD
---
First 6 hours filled with griefers lol. Trying to learn and scavange and nothing but angry emotes and people trying to loot everything I'm looting.
---
Farm whitespring do public events there free to fast travel to.
---
Lol no offence bro and I‚Äôm going to say this very politely. I really don‚Äôt care what gun you prefer nor do I care what gun anyone prefers. I simply stated a fact about prices on high tier items as examples of why you would need ‚Äú more currency ‚Äú because that‚Äôs the question ‚Äú you asked ‚Äú . I‚Äôm not going to get into why you would ‚Äú want ‚Äú those specific rolls because this post Isn‚Äôt about that. Go do a google search on why people use the quad ffr fr tesla  and all the information will be there for you. 
---
Regarding my ‚Äú wealth ‚Äú , no I have not reached the point of acquiring everything in the game. That would take a very long time and I switch builds more then I count due to boredom when I need a break from trading or farming the same build all the time. 
---
But anyways, moving along. I‚Äôm simply giving this person and others advice on how to make caps efficiently from my experience. I‚Äôve said my two cents. 
---
For anyone who takes my advice, feel free to come back and let me know how it works out for you !
---
Best of luck!
---
Screwed up part is they could easily make this game just store items on your console or PC save data thus not effecting their servers.
---
Scrip the gamma and sell the railway for 5-6k in my opinion.
---
I need both that and to revive from water. If you find a diffuser, please let me know! I haven't had any luck.
---
Check your STAT effects in the PipBoy, and it will tell you your current effects, both positive and negative. Diseases come from practically everything, and can be taken care of with disease cures, antibiotics, the fountain at the Whitesprings (near the tennis area under the dome), or just ignored if they're not really something that is going to bother your game play. The Pipboy will also tell you how much longer you have them for. None of them last forever, so don't worry about them overly much. I normally make some disease cures whenever the daily tells me to make healing items, and then I have like 10 or so. You can pick them up pretty often in aid boxes, too, so I rarely run out.   
---
The shield means, as others have said, a piece of your armor needs fixing. Weapons will also need fixing eventually, you'll see a little gun shape in red like the shield. You can check which piece by going into your inventory, hovering over each item you use and checking the "CND" line. It'll have a bar that goes down as your item is used, or hit. Repairing items can either happen at a workbench, or using Repair Kits.  If you manually repair you armor, if you have the perk cards, try to always equip the ones that help fix over 100%. "Fix it Good" for armor and "Weapon Artisan" for weapons. That way you don't have to repair as often, and you don't need as much junk in the long run. As to Repair Kits, you don't have to buy them in the Atom Shop, they also drop from certain quests (I can't recall which ones, sorry), and the SBQ event drops them as well. If using repair kits, you can repair on the fly, by selecting "Inspect/Repair" in your inventory, and then using the repair kit. You can allegedly do it from your favorite wheel, but that always makes me CTD, so I never even try it anymore. I actually have like 35 Repair Kits and use them pretty much exclusively. If you're worried about being too low a level to do damage to the queen, remember that you just have to be in the event area to get the event rewards. You might not be able to loot the queen, since you have to do a percentage of damage to loot her, but you'll always at least get the event stuff. Some of which is pretty rare, and valuable.

Early on lots of rads is bad, but later many players choose to be highly irradiated to run "Bloody" builds. I run around 50-60/268 HP. With Unyielding armor, and bloody legendary weapons, I can regularly do 2K in damage. I can 3 shot a level 50 Scorchbeast. 
---
Most end game players use mutations, as well. I personally have 7 mutations. With the "Starched Genes" so mutations don't ever go away, and the "Class Freak" perk, that lowers the negatives of mutations, I can snipe further, run faster, jump farther, carry more, etc.

Doughnut camp layouts can have a ton of space. The trick is finding a good place to build one.
---
Did encryptid 2x last night and towards the end of both events just as we were getting the upper hand the game would freeze and lock up the pc.
---
Is it because of certain types of pa or what? Used to run fairly smoothly except when it first started months ago ( the event ).

Thanks. I had a lot of fun building it, and sometimes I just like sitting there with my stuffies playing music :p
---
i thik he means can you place items in the world like in fallout 4 ...no you cannot if you drop something it goes into a bag
---
Knowing my luck my alt would die and loose all my stuff
---
It's pretty cool down there. I always have radroach and glowing mushrooms to eat, too!  Yum yum :p
---
i think he is asking can you place items from your inventory around the world like in fallout 4 by dropping them
---
Do you mean placing each item on the ground separately? If so, no you can't. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you mean, can you use something besides a bag? Yes there are a couple new options in the Atom store. I use the gravestone, as it sticks up out of the grass when I die.
---
Well, if it's any consolation, even though the briefcase can be taken, the codes are rendered useless. I had my share of such deaths, which taugh me to remain hidden, especially when viewing the inventory ;)

PS. If you're on PC, we could play in a Team :)

I guess that this order is a mystery for the character
---
Tbh NPCs but they're coming. But tbh I hope they don't feel as dead as FO3, FNV or FO4's. Like 76's holotapes had more emotion than anyone in FNV
---
I've been looking for the Responders Fireman Uniform, thanks for the list where it can drop from, want it to go with the Responders Fireman Helmet I got.
---
You can also make them yourself and then scrap them.

Human NPCs and dialogue so I'm hyped for wastelanders. I love the found world style of the game but after a year I'm ready for the next chapter.

Surprisingly, you can also boil water at the chemistry station, so why not the brewing one?

I play on Xbox and someone built their camp right where the first quest is and I was looking around and this guy shot me up and followed me for an hour messing with me.
---
My experience has not been positive on Xbox. I killed something then someone in the area trys to grab it after I killed it. I snatch it up and run. Then they chase me down and melee me and shoot me hoping for me to retaliate. I just exited server and went to a new one. Got griefed by low level squad.
---
I'm happy you had a good experience. The games not super glitchy but is very cool and interesting. The camp part of the game is my fav so far. Very versatile.
---
I haven't had a real crash that wasn't connected to my internet in I don't even know how long.

That‚Äôs horrible! Probably some kids thinking they are so cool. Hopefully you get away from them. The camp is pretty dope lol.
---
This. I have server hopped both locations at it shows up at the Soft Server way more often AND no one ever has their CAMP there.
---
Or they could be waiting for you at your camp, in an infirmary bed you can build to revive your allies!
---
Starched Genes unlocks at level 46
---
I did! Ended up switching servers a few times. 
---
Literally set the camp up when you don't want use a loading screen lol. Sometimes set it up close enough to a vendor to run back and forth to sell a few things. Literally pays for it's self. 
---
Funniest interaction I've had was killing a ghoul and it's disappear and then from out of no where it's ghosting walking out of a cabin in the air and unlootable lol. Or just the random poof enemy corpse is gone.

Ah, so I don't have to worry about people coming and taking my walls if I ever built a house! Nice. Thanks for the help!

Gotcha. Thanks for the help!

I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the help!
---
I don't want you to get mad at me, but I think it's kinda funny that months after everyone has figured out the best way to do this is Encrypted, people still post rants about it. Like 900000 other threads ranting about it with the exact same answer posted every time, and yet people still post rants.
---
So very true!
---
Manage your inventory better..
---
In my experience, a percentage is always better than a number.  The same can be said for defense, damage, etc.
---
The +25 from well hydrated is ‚Äúin addition to‚Äù the set number you regenerate per second.  While I can‚Äôt see the number on my screen, it is considerably slower than two ranks of action boy and one AP refresh armor piece.  
---
The legendary armor effect seems to outperform Action Boy, or at least match it.  With more than one piece your AP will rocket back to full in a couple seconds.  I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs intentional, but it‚Äôs an incredible effect for a VATS build.

This and mods.

Some of those would make for good backgrounds for portrait displays/phones. I'll add your biological and technological distinctiveness to my own. lol
---
Where is it?
---
Well if you're playing on Xbox I can help you. As far as tips, I suggest you get some melee weapon and farm low level events. Or try to get a hit in enemies around whitesprings and let the Whitesprings bots kill the ghouls.
---
I would love this. And as I've said before, a cash register.
---
I actually got small shack with turrets set up on the golf course to kill the ghouls however everytime I spent they're level 9. Ofcourse that sounds good.

What did it look like?

Disco Stu has one for you

Shit. I never thought of that before. Lol
---
Maybe do the same thing in cranberry bog area?
---
If you have the perk for better dog food (idk why you would) than dogfood is best. Otherwise Salisbury steak. Sugar bombs for ap refresh. 
---
I have the carnivore mutation so I have no use making prewar food for the sake of hunger, so personally I would always pick sugar bombs if I were to take over the factor

There‚Äôs a legendary sale going on right now.  I got a suppressors/explosive pipe rifle for 37 scrip and converted it to full auto.  It works great for tagging legendary enemies and not being a dickhead at events.

They're not quite off, most people could find the location in 2 minutes just running down the right from the estates like I said. And yes, there is a glass greenhouse beside one of the houses, I was there like two days ago. xD

I was kinda expecting something like this from the hollow even event...
---
I dc's about once a day for about a week about 2 weeks ago..now Im down to once or twice a week. I've found that it depends on how many quest I have pinned and the amount of people on the server. Then again, I've played with full worlds for 8 hours straight. It probably boils down to where your pinging from and too.
---
Did swimmer recently. You can knock out the quest objective (kindness) and the merit badge's revive in water simultaneously.
---
A weeks worth? Even when I disconnect, which has happened its fair share in public world.. Ive maintained everything on me since last kill, inconvenient during events but not a devasting loss to say the least.. I stash junk every 30mins to an hour, and I junk "a lot".
---
Totally! It isn't even the case that all owned/ bought stuff gets pushed all way down. It is all just mixed in.
---
I honestly feel the same. All asylum outfits i want to show to the world the work i put into this game.
---
Why not switch servers once in a while? Isn't that beneficial anyway?
---
Walk down the street with a cardboard sign and an old Starbucks cup.

Selling in game things for real cash is not only a violation of the terms of service but it's also fuckin lame, dude

Yea thats what I do.. Like I said, not a real issue for me as of late.. And I routinely world hop for more active event players and to check camp vendors.

Anything is possible. Obviously theres certain factors in disconnecting more often. Someone who carries 3 weapons on them vs someone with full weapon weight reduced, 100 guns at all times, every holotape and note they have ever found.

I very rarely disconnect or notice bugs. I mentioned this in a post a while back and got met with a tirade of responses about tiny insignificant bugs that I never notice, either because they only effect certain clothing items I don‚Äôt wear like random glasses or because their effect is so small you don‚Äôt even notice it while concentrating on game play. The game is no where near as bad as the ‚Äúbuggy mess‚Äù 99% of youtubers say it is ( not saying there are no bugs, just that I rarely encounter any and the ones I do encounter are not ‚Äúgame breaking‚Äù as overzealous serial complainers would have you believe ) and with regards to server disconnects, I can honestly say I rarely disconnect and about 80% of the time when I do disconnect I can join the same world with friends who had no problem leading me to believe the disconnect was a problem on my end. Also, I‚Äôve never played any online game that doesn‚Äôt suffer from server disconnects or lag every once in a while so it really surprises me that people get so heated about it and blame the devs lol. Feeling aggrieved is a common way for some people to join the conversation without actually having to engage too much with the game, I mean if I played the game and didn‚Äôt much like it after 2 hrs and stopped playing it, although I haven‚Äôt played the game enough to really make an informed opinion, all I have to do is look up a bad review on YouTube to give me bad points on the game so I can argue with people why I don‚Äôt like it. In the case of 76 youtubers and bad publicity helped shape peoples opinions of the game before they played it and created an echo chamber of negativity towards the game largely from a group of people that never played it or stopped playing early because they either didn‚Äôt enjoy it or were persuaded not to like it by the hate train.
---
This game is still basically sold for full price AND it has a subscription that unlocks the full game if you buy it. If it was free to play, I'd fully understand the scrap box and shit. I'd still be pissed off because I bought the game, but it would still be fair for them to sell a subscription if it was F2P. 
---
Earlier I already had a hard time recommending this game to literally anyone - now I don't even consider bringing it up in any conversation because of the ridiculous pay once + subscribe monthly payment model. It's completely, utterly laughable and pathetic of Bethesda to not give the scrapbox to every player.

---
this thing?
---
I actually like the idea. But keep it as a skin, not new PA variant.
---
By default the game only saves every few minutes unless you fast travel, discover a new location, or complete a quest step.  Unfortunately, fast travel is one of the most likely times for a crash or freeze to occur, and this can result in the loss of recently acquired items.  
---
Because fast travel is a very common activity, I would tend to believe people who claim to have lost items due to a crash.
---
Oh yea well i dont fucking care downvoted
---
Radium rifle mods..

This game is poorly developed toward ultra wide screens. I have 21:9 and everything is stretched toward side edges. On even wider screens can be problems like yours.
---
Nice read
---
This post is a joke, right!?
---
Still, again, I have never experienced this in almost a thousand hours. I'm not disbelieving anyone, I'm just saying it ses to me that this issue isn't as common as the forum makes it seem.
---
When your 1st runs out you can still access the scrap in your scrap box but you can't put any more in.
---
This post almost makes me wish for a nuclear winter.
---
I totally agree with the OP. That said, no it doesn't go away. You can take stuff out of it, but no more depositing into it.
---
This is exactly what I mean. I'd say 95% of the time if I disconnect it's because I want to go to a different server I disconnect myself.
---
Nope, they've been mothballed some weeks ago.
---
good bait, op
---
I have spoken
---
Like I said, kill them most of the way and then punch them when they are almost dead. Don't get salty because you weren't smart enough to think of an easier way than running around like an idiot punching them to death.
---
I remember seeing these quite a few times during beta and early into release. Haven't seen them in forever though.
---
Yeah Im having the same issue for Fo4. Everytime I see a workbench I want to scrap all junk I have on my inventory, but then I remember that even if it existed it would be pointless because we had unlimited stash weight in Fo4.
---
To all the downvotes; would you care to explain what I got wrong? Technically, not your feels.
---
That could be a cool reward for a new Vault Raid
---
&gt; In FO76, other players left me alone, i left them alone. When i discovered that i had to team up to complete some co-op quests to get backpack blueprints, that was kind of it for me.

You don't.

I've already got everything but the torches and smoke machine so it would be the worst value bundle for me. They need to sell everything separately also.

I have  furious explosive LMG. Primed n i just kill everything in sight easily.

I picked up a bag of loot last week and blue screened just before I got the last item. I rejoined my friend on the same server and still had all the stuff I picked up, and the last item was still in the loot bag when I went over to it. I have never lost anything when disconnected and if I have it must have been insignificant because I sure as hell didn‚Äôt notice.
---
&gt; Hardest bit is killing a yao-gui with a syringer
---
Equip syringer.  Kill Yogi Bear with grenades.
---
Kind of.  I know this game front to back due to having 100%ed it over 10 times.  Amazing what a year of not playing something will do to you.  More of a 76 appreciation post; New Vegas is still second only to San Andreas as far as games go IMO
---
Thanks yep TIL i can go solo and still get me backpacks. Cheers!
---
Love the game but can't say it's the best looking game out there. FPS fallout looked like shiet even by 2008 standards. When I first played fallout 3 I was like 'how the fuck did this game win GOTY?' then I got hooked up for life
---
Exactly lol.  I booted up NV because I always do around this time of the year.  Keeps me coming back; must still be a great game
---
I got the Unstoppables bundle. I mean I got it on accident but still. Good value if you like the Unstoppables stuff

Holy crap you are truly amazing must have been my outstanding description of the said item..lol.. thanking you.

Idiots shouldn't be carrying their entire junk collection around with them and they wouldn't have a problem. My game drops out occasionally but usually in high lag areas like the SBQ or vault raids on a bad server.

I run 1 Charisma and can sell Serums for 200.  I‚Äôve seen posts about getting 350 for serums... so I‚Äôd say yes.  It does

Not that much, but it's a noticeable difference. You can save about 4k on mutation serums for one. I just equip Hard Bargain and take grape Mentats every time I go to buy or sell stuff.
---
&gt; Tried to add Fallout 76 to my steam library it gave me a pop up message saying "Fallout 76 Catastrophic failure"

Everybody's a critic.
---
New Vegas gets well-earned praise for a lot of things, but no one's praising it for its polish or combat. In fact if the story doesn't do much for you, it doesn't really surpass Bethesda's games.
---
For serums I can see, I‚Äôm at a vendor now and if I sold the healing factor it‚Äôs 440. But I mean just stuff like weapons and armor.
---
Ah.  I‚Äôm a hoarder, so I scrap Weapons and armor.  I can usually get caps for junk, so I don‚Äôt rely on the vendors

The answer is no. Most haven't had zero issues. Most of whom who have were caught cheating in some way (in a game that really isn't pvp)

2. follow the instructions.

Zenimax do not control how Sony's UI works.
---
Exactly what I was thinking too, should probably start including a disclaimer in all requests that you would like this feature without paying extra for the ability.
---
I mean it as in Zenimax wants people to not understand how to end the subscription. I know they do not control the UI but UI confusion leads to people forgetting payments when they quit playing the game.
---
They have a few of these server hop challenges that are quite irksome.
---
Get a friend into it. Trick him out and dont tell him how much is it worth.
---
Irrelevant
---
Sony deliberately made it hard to see how to end the subscription.  Sony make money from the subscription.  You say it's Zenimax's fault.  Ok.
---
Yup. Usually a couple show up.
---
No, I am saying that Zenimax is the one who makes the money from these subscriptions. Regardless of maker, the profits hey get is from people forgetting to end their subscription. They obviously would make money from people not knowing how to end their subscription.
---
From guns.
---
When you go to a work bench and hit mod weapon or mod armor it will tell you in the top right how many of the mods there are and how many of them you already know. They only recently added that feature.
---
&gt; No, I am saying that Zenimax is the one who makes the money from these subscriptions
---
Actually, they're not.  Sony takes a cut of everything in the Sony store. Sony decided to make it hard to find how to end the subscription.
---
Yes, the nature of repeat subscriptions is that people forget to cancel them, but there is one company in this transaction that is *deliberately* making it hard to cancel it, and it's not Zenimax,.
---
Join the club.....got a JFFR, want a BFFR.
---
I was still playing new Vegas while fallout 4 was out. 
---
I still to this day miss the true anti material rifle with its exploding bullets, watching the victims rag doll as it obliterated them in slow motion.
---
Any challange that is kill a X in the bog,I just drop a nuke on the queen. I get my atom points plus a queen and the event rewards.
---
If sony is the only one making the profit, why would PC players be charged? I'm just saying that subscription services like when places have confusing subscription services which leads to more profits. I was comparing it to Paypal which too is guilty of the same UI as sony; ass-backwards and hard to cancel something. I'd expect sony to take a minor cut but Zeni is the one who came up.with the idea for at least fallout 1st.
---
What‚Äôs your characters Int? There is a notable difference between 1-5 and 15+ in the xp gains.
---
Lvl 86 as of today.. Never seen a Mega Sloth or Alien or Backwoods Creature... Well technically I spotted it at level 3 before it teleported or something.. Just got my second mothman yesterday.
---
Looking for a BE one.
---
No there are no mods. I was saying if you Aim Down Sights and burst fire it was managabily accurate.
---
Had someone fire about a thousand mini nukes at my base and then made me glow purple. I'm still purple...
---
I got the mothman bundle when it originally came out, bought it by accident as well. But turned out a happy accident. I wasnt really into the mothman theme, but I actually like a lot of the stuff in it - and there is quite a fair bit in it. Chairs, those statue things, a bed, not to mention the smoke machine and the effigy. I had no actual idea what came with it and I kept on discovering new items. 
---
The table and lamps look pretty nice too, even in a normal camp not mothman themed.
---
I was definitely happy with it, despite me accidentally clicking buy!
---
Drop a nuke on queen. 2-4 will spawn ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è easy
---
I pray to come across a multi-nuke situation like this haha! This game has a majorly fantastic player base! So passionate, thoughtful and generous.
---
&gt; If sony is the only one making the profit, why would PC players be charged?
---
I didn't say that.
---
I said:
---
&gt; Sony takes *a cut* of everything in the Sony store. 
---
A cut.  that means part of the price.  The subject of this conversation is how to cancel FO1ST *on a Sony Playstation* and the difficult *Sony* UI you have to use.
---
But never mind, you wan't to be pissed at Zenimax, feel free.
---
My lord, like talking to a brick wall. I'm not pissed at zenimax, it's zenimax that handles all the money affairs. All I have said is that Zenimax, cause it is Fallout 1st and theirs, likes it when its confusing to end a 1st service.
---
That's normally what my team &amp; I do as well. Easier &amp; more rewarding.
---
Once was in a four-way fight between a legendary SB, laser armed super mutants and a Hermit Crab.
---
Fucking muties ashed the SB in midair, no corpse to loot.

---
3: OMG it‚Äôs nearly 2020 but a bloody headset and speak
---
Agreed, until you are fully capable of farming locations yourself for high end gear the lvl 40 items the miners drop are absolutely servicable.
---
You will want higher end gear, but can absolute run around for 50 lvls using it.
---
They keep trying but they seem afraid of overshadowing the queen.
---
1. agreed I would like smoother gameplay as well. 
---
2. agreed on the graphics. I feel like they added so much detail they broke the ability to render it correctly in a multiplayer.I dont like how fuzzy and blurry everything gets at a distance. 
---
3. completely disagree on nothing to do in end game. been playing since beta, theres still more to do than I have time for. most recent activity. I built my camp into an airship. its amazing. I win at 76, I win at life. 
---
I want to go back to being able to shoot the mainframe cores in the silo. currently you have to click each one individually.
---
I use the armored mod backpack 99% of the time and it‚Äôs very helpful. The HC backpack for bloodied is completely useless to have all the time, only use that for emergency times when you have to much and don‚Äôt want to drop anything.
---
My opinion:
---
If you‚Äôre melee than than RR backpack would work better since you‚Äôre getting closer to radiated enemies more often.
---
Ranged, either armored or RR, you can decided what‚Äôs more important. This is what I play and go with the armor only because I can stay alway from rads pretty well usually.
---
i jus want more than 30k cap limit and the vendors to hold more caps or for all of them to have seperate pools of 1400 caps.
---
Xbox?
---
I'll have to look out for you in-game and come visit your camp, sounds interesting!
---
Yep, agree with you. Nothing worse than mobs suddenly multiple levels higher than you, and then legendary often too just spawn out of nowhere because some random level 327 player walked past.
---
Theoretically you could pay for one month, spend the whole month hoarding tons of scrap and just live off all the raw scrap for months then.
---
YES PLEASE! That was one thing I forgot to add on my list, it would help SO MUCH! I use a microphone, but it seems a lot of people don't or choose not to, which makes it hard to communicate.
---
lol imma go watch some of his stuff it has been awhile :P
---
I just went through this again for the third time. This last time it happened 27 times in a row before I deleted the game and reinstalled. Now works just fine. It has something to do with corrupt data, but this is the only solution that works
---
I do agree, the two shot prefix on legendary equipment does make it harder to aim however with the proper perks and or mods like the minigun tri barrel and the perk stabilized to help make up for the reduced accuracy. Don't get me wrong though there are still better prefixes than 2 shot. Me personally I'm looking into switching my two shot explosive minigun for a vampire's explosive one.
---
That's the trouble I see. I won't collaborate with the wiki because there are a ton of those.
---
Anyone who thinks of NW as a "grind" is missing the point.
---
Some people don't want the monotony of nuking the Queen for the 1 millionth time. That seems like a grind. In NW, you're fighting actual people. They can think, unlike the simple Adventure AIs. It's a challenge. No two matches are the same. You have to constantly adapt and improvise. You make a lot of good friends and have a blast bonding with them.
---
gamma guns have their purpose in pvp many want them. sell it if u dont use it. put automatic mod on railway then its a great gun. i'd take it. ;)
---
Not a donation. Contest winners get an amazon code for atom redemption. Thanks for inquiring though :)
---
A lot of people in this subreddit seem to despise the idea of text chat due to what they call "toxicity" which makes me question about the "Amazing" and "helpfull" community they boast this game has.
---
Honestly I‚Äôve seen people say they want a ‚Äúcloud‚Äù like stash box that‚Äôs accessible by all their characters. 
---
I think the scrap box should be moved to base players, and Fallout 1st should get the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù stash, along with the survival tent and occasional exclusive skins etc. 
---
I think that would be a change that makes most people happy, since a ‚Äúcloud‚Äù box isn‚Äôt as needed to enjoy the game as a scrap box is and the scrap box would really help keep the game from devolving into inventory management simulator, which is where it‚Äôs at currently for me since the game loop revolves around getting scrap and leveling  my character and my box is around 700 lbs.
---
I can‚Äôt believe your advertising a discord sever on question about why do you play 76 and your trying to lure people with free atoms
---
I think most people in this subreddit despise most ideas and despise Fallout 76, to be fair. I don't see the issue as long there were some options such as mature language filter, anti-spam filter, and option to report players who abuse it.
---
Your still commenting.....
---
The moment you crouch you turn completely invisible to enemies for a split second, which in most cases brings you out of ‚Äúdanger‚Äù and into ‚Äúcaution‚Äù, keeping you in stealth. Combined with Sneak 3 this makes you pretty tough to detect. If you‚Äôre found you can usually run off and crouch again where enemies can‚Äôt see you and renew your caution status. You can walk right through most enemies without them noticing, with a silenced or melee weapon you can kill them without the others noticing. Because it‚Äôs fallout, because it‚Äôs BGS, it doesn‚Äôt always work, and while scrapping guys tend to still be able to find me, crouched or not, but for a 1* card it‚Äôs a great one. It can be enhanced with bobble heads and magazines and calmex and such too.
---
And your the being scummy trying to lure players to your discord with free atoms
---
Still...,,

This method requires another person, so solo players won‚Äôt get much help here, but the challenge is ‚Äúkill a mega sloth‚Äù while YOU ‚Äúare in the cranberry bog‚Äù. There‚Äôs a fixed spawn for a mega sloth near the crashed airplane in the mire, there used to be a Primal Cuts near him during meat week. Go to him with a friend, you tag the sloth. Don‚Äôt kill him. You fast travel to the bog. Give your team mate a thumbs up or else a verbal go-ahead to kill the sloth once you land in the bog. 20 atoms. Jump servers to the same guaranteed sloth spawn, repeat with your rolls reversed and you‚Äôll both have it no sweat.
---
I never understood it. 
---
Dataminers say it make you invisible(as completely undetectable) for one second.
---
It seems to work inconsistently,and i'm not talking about spamming crouch. It's hard to figure out if it's the card working or your sneak+agility.
---
In theory it should be that if get spotted,you crouch and go to caution.
---
But most the times enemies just know you're still there and danger never goes away.
---
There was a time when it also had an interaction with chameleon and could make you permanently invisible. Maybe chameleon still breaks it somehow.
---
You expect it there though.
---
LOL I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve scrapped over 100.  No luck yet.
---
I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs a radium rifle and not a handmade.
---
1st Rule -  You can't get rid of Rad Worms till Rad Worms decide to get rid of you.

2nd Rule - Use Antibiotics, disease cure.
---
3 Rule - You got contracted with Rad Worms

Ty, saved!

Sounds great. Congrats man :)

 Plans for mannequins , the atom store will add [paint](https://www.google.com/search?q=mannequins&amp;newwindow=1&amp;sxsrf=ACYBGNQn1PqP9LY4wRc_-ReuR3GA7KqPPA:1575115771949&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiCs8TA85HmAhUNRK0KHYQPDv8Q_AUoAnoECA8QBA&amp;biw=1414&amp;bih=883) to make them look more male/female.
---
We all pre ordered for some reason I didn‚Äôt get my beta code so I had to wait for the public beta
---
Continent you live on?
---
Looks like it‚Äôs already been answered but I‚Äôll add one thing that wasn‚Äôt obvious to me at first. Make sure when you‚Äôre crafting the lowest level guns to use for scrapping. They cost less junk to build, but still give you the same mods in return. I got every mod for levers in about 2 days of building and scrapping.
---
Thanks I'll try that tomorrow.
---
VATS works fine? 100% fine, or it's okay but needs improvement? It's hard to distinguish what you mean with your terrible attitude, but I see based on your comment history that most of your comments are similar.
---
What system?
---
Lmao stalking my whole profile because I respond in kind to your condescending comments? Have a cry about it. As I said, VATS is fine, git gud.
---
Saw this on PC, Europe region.
---
You can use the explosive bait to make scorchbeast land
---
4. Just as we're thinking not much will be happening again tonight let's just farm random legendaries get scrips and be done.
---
"so and so has launched a nuke"... 
---
Fast forward right after queen #6 in 2-3  hours ran out of last ultracite fusion and plasma cores and was going to quit. Heard sound of flies over a meat pile I'd missed. Anti-armor explosive LMG. Noticed I had maybe 500 rounds on me. Tore through a 3 star lvl 80 SB in 5 seconds. Went to whoever's  1st tent was right there and got rest of .308 I'd been saving, kept killing shit another half hour just cause that gun is so damn fun...
---
Could be like the vault 94 armor except for a scorched raid
---
Been like that since the beginning. It doesn‚Äôt really need fixing either, there are much worse bugs that Bethesda is still ignoring.
---
You should be able to get 2-3 attacks off, BUT, Scorched tend to be very good at spotting me (I was once running Agl33, Sneak3 and Escape Artist), once spotted, you may find it tough to go back in to Caution while so close to her.
---
Wear a hat, it fixes that issue. At least for me :p
---
Same with not being over its great tbh xD you can run a good 30 sec to if you run right after you get in
---
I think it has to do with the calculations for detection. I don't know much about it's specifics, but I remember reading about it in the dataminer AMA. 
---
I use escape artist all the time, and I think whether or not it works depends on a few variables.
---
 The most important being line of sight and also lighting. If the enemies can see you crouch into stealth in broad daylight and you're not too far away, it's not gonna work. 
---
But if you say run and hide behind a tree, or around a corner, or just in a shadow, and you break the line of sight then it's most likely going to work. Of course it's BGS so things don't always work as intended, but for me it is a must have on any stealth character, even if I have chameleon armor
---
I was in the middle of a silo earlier and the server decided to keep freezing, disconnect reconnect bs.  I decided to leave and do a new server best choice.
---
That is enraging though you were about to hit launch.
---
Word! Good luck to us :P
---
Happens when you die also. Seems fine to me. Kinda like the old invincibility you‚Äôd get in old side scrollers. It‚Äôs a small buff so you can run away (or toward action) after you load in
---
Zero chance legit
---
What about those who sit by and do nothing but add lag?
---
Add me TheMisterFaust
---
My challenge advices should have a pinned post.
---
Tag a sloth anywhere and let a friend kill it while YOU are in the cramberry bog.
---
Easy, 2 minutes, done.
---
Before the hermits come saying they don't have friends,just ask people on the map. Novody ever refused to get 20 atom this easy.
---
All of them have been duped, so they're out there now.
---
You mean the 20 players remaining playing this pile of garbage
---
Its great to have when you port to your house no ammo buggy as hell naked super mutants fisting your b hole trying to reload yiur gun and all you can do is run forever when that happens to yah you will tank me.
---
Saw the title of the post. Immediately assumed this was on PC. 100% duped. Sad.
---
A good day was had by all, well except for the scorchbeasts, they don't deserve a good day, just endless bad ones. Well done to all who took part.
---
It's more fun than the base game at the moment. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I love a good queen run, I enjoy doing silos, and building, but there's just something oh so fun about nuking people you have a friendly rivalry with.
---
I know that my team and I (just the 3 of us, we haven't found the right 4th) have grown so much and can come face to face with the big names, sometimes we win, sometimes we lose. We have a ton more room for growing, and that makes it challenging and fun. 
---
Plus I just love playing NW with my husband and our friend.
---
This is a problem how?
---
My friends. However, I do love building, and I do love Nuclear Winter.
---
Oh god I haven't seen one of these since the BETA.
---
found one! thank you tho!
---
If you scrapped all 200 of those mods you would never even notice (except the 300 lb increase in stash space)!! I hoarded mods for awhile too. Had around 40. One day I realized I hadn‚Äôt used or sold a mod in over a month. I decided to scrap them all and now I don‚Äôt pick them up at all.
---
I asked for the same thing some time ago(my post wasn't as successful though for some reason) and can only agree.  The workbench is literally a boiler!
---
Makes me sad to see. I understand people really want the masks, but it's just such a shame.
---
[Bethesda did not like that]
---
I want some ice cream.
---
What flavor?
---
It‚Äôs for my ass.
---
I play on Xbox. I am having a hard time even understanding the in-game economy on PC. How does anything even have value? Rarity is basically non-existent. Want a legacy gun? No problem there is an unlimited supply! Want the ‚Äúrarest‚Äù costumes? No problem we can make an unlimited amount of them.
---
Why is it sad? Bethesda made the masks essentially unobtainable. That‚Äôs what is really sad. I‚Äôm on Xbox as far as I know these don‚Äôt exist there.
---
Why/how are you spending that much valuable ammo and not hitting her enough? Are your damage numbers on?
---
I just bush wookie the whole match and get 2nd or 3rd consistently now. The other day I just hid inside another players camp towards the end while he duked it out with 3 other players lol
---
Dude probably bought them. I came across a CAMP that had all of them, plus some legacys. Dude had 1500 hours on the game, and several caracters.
---
Git gud.
---
&gt; So that's my thoughts, what are some of your ideas on how the game could improve? 
---
In my mind, a lot of the issue with the game are meta to the in-game world.
---
So things like:
---
1. Change in upper management to a more experienced team
---
2. More experienced devs, especially in online multiplayer RPG space
---
3. More resources dedicated to the dev and support teams, especially on QA
---
4. Spend time thinking through issues/features and properly test them. Faster and cheaper to spend a little extra time dealing with an issue once rather than having to revisit fixing it time and time again
---
5. A focus less on making profit and more on providing value to the player to organically grow the playerbase and in term revenue stream
---
6. More community engagement and actually listen and act on the feedback given as is. Bethesda has clearly shown that their players know better than they to as to what features will be well received (stash boxes, display cases, fridges vs unwanted PA overhaul, Top 3 leaderboard, public events placed into a queue etc.)
---
Fix these issues and a lot of the game issues resolve themselves.
---
He bought them but they were not acquired legitimately. No way.
---
Take a nap, have some cranberry juice, and some cobbler(the xp boosts stack)!
---
We who are killing those sbq are getting 1 or 2 star
---
I've had an ongoing problem since Christmas last year that still isn't fixed. Everytime I submit a ticket we go through the exact same process that didn't work the first 3 times only for them to throw their hands in the air and say "Well I don't know. We can't fix it. Just live with it." Now they don't even bother to answer the ticket. They just toss out "We are considering your issue" and close it then two days later I get a customer satisfaction survey. Bethesda support is either completely hobbled and not allowed to do anything productive or they are absolutely inept and horrible at their jobs.
---
Some valid points there, I agree there could be some better changes behind the scenes and more communication. The game was definitely rushed out, no doubt about it. Seems to be a trend nowadays, rush out the game 1-2 years too early and then fix it later, which makes absolutely no sense to me. Why risk getting terrible reviews, losing a huge potential playerbase, just to hope that *one day* the game might be better?
---
9- increase the size of subtitle text
---
I ordered the Power Armor Edition. Fortunately got to play the BETA. it was a lot of fun :)
---
It's sad because they didn't earn them, they just duped. It cheapens it for the people who did actually earn them. Considering Fasnacht will be returning, BGS may increase the spawn percentage. The drop rates for the Halloween event were much higher.
---
Thing is they were completely balanced around that. Now with all this crafting bullshit every game loves to have you're going to slam into inventory walls all the more faster.
---
With like the green crystal growths coming out of it, that would be cool.
---
I had a situation like this happen but the first scorchbeast queen we fought did not drop any legendary Items. The second one had the god mode glitch where you could not do any damage and eventually just disappeared after everyone ran out of ammo and someone then nuked again.  The third as soon as it died the body disappeared and people were so mad they started leaving the server. I stayed around to collect flux and stuff and somehow I ran into the body of the scorchbeast queen in a totally different area than where we killed it and was able to get some really good loot and a legendary Item or two. I let the people know who stayed where the body was and they got stuff too.
---
At higher skill levels, camps are terrible. None of the top players on PS4 set up camps, except for the odd blueprinted siege ladder.
---
It's the latter, they've always been like that. To compare, I can shit on Blizzard till kingdom come, but their support is impeccable. Zenimax could really learn.
---
Add me jasozan
---
That seems like the cheaters problem is mostly on the NA Server. I play on the European server and Ive only got to see like 3 or 4 cheaters, so Ive either had a tonn of luck, or there is realy only the NA server that is filled with them.
---
I solo &amp; I got a backpack
---
You find it under services.
---
I‚Äôll check now
---
It worked thanks!!
---
We just have different perspective on it. To me duping isn‚Äôt the moral fault which some people view it as.
---
Yes I‚Äôm looking forward to fasnacht round 2. Hope they fix the drop rates so people in Xbox world finally get the sun mask or jester. Old man winter was available and then duped but I didn‚Äôt snag one unfortunately.
---
If all these people quit playing where are they on this 76 discussion move on
---
There are no trophies for just showing up... If you're not doing enough damage then there are other aspects of the game for you to work on and grind through to be able to hit harder and earn your place at the SBQ table.
---
Looks like you need to keep your head in the game
---
I‚Äôm gonna load up that poor fuck with all my 20 lbs+ garbage shit
---
My brother is on pc and told me that if the game was CP i'll buy it, but unfortunately it's not
---
Mr Fuzzy ride, period :-)
---
If there is no registering hit on queen then nothing. If bullets have been fired in hundreds of rounds. We should get something
---
My numbers r only 3-4 with a berserker explosive gatling gun at close range. Level 55 only. My perks aint powerful
---
Did you have send the helmet back or did you get the normal one
---
Why in the world im getting downvotes smh
---
The Old Man Winter mask was the only one obtained legitimately, but they were duped within weeks after the event so he probably didn‚Äôt. All the other masks had to be hacked in and mass duped. Although I consider it fair game, because the drop rates were bugged to not drop at all and Bethesda didn‚Äôt fix it, saying that they were meant to just be a really low chance. 
---
BTW, there is no sun mask, nobody can figure out how to get it.
---
Nah man PC, sorry!
---
COD = Cash on Delivery
---
Damn i often do 3 queens in a row...goodluck!
---
Too risky to carry that much junk on your toon for this exact reason. If you're going to be overweight have it be weapons and amor and get all that junk into your stash for your crafting sessions.
---
Fallout 1st doesn't count scrap and stable flux against your stash if you put it in the Scrapbox. Junk is still junk that can only be put into your stash unless you break it into scrap, then it can be put in the Scrapbox. What might have saved your bacon here is the Private World where you can rejoin your world after disconnecting from it for about 5 mins. This makes it possible to exchange items between toons on the same account, or go back and retrieve dropped items in the case like you describe.
---
I came across the source of the PA Horde:  https://imgur.com/gallery/F0BvjFK
---
Apparently they were up to no good heading north towards the top of the world
---
What weapon are you using. I‚Äôm surprised if you‚Äôve used that much ammo you aren‚Äôt getting loot.
---
You cannot drop items outside of the bag, but you can put items into world containers like suitcases and lunch boxes.
---
If you want to display your items, there are display cases and stands in the CAMP menu to do this on a limited basis.
---
Have you learned the mods? Pretty sure I got brawling plans the other day.
---
Need a way to sell/buy ammo in bulk because there is no decimal system for pricing individual rounds everything has to be a minimum of 1 cap which makes it difficult to determine the value of ammo, there probably aren't many rounds that are worth more than 1 cap per round, 10mm for example could be 0.10 cap per round or 0.01 or some other value but the game doesn't have a way to decimalise.
---
Hey! We know steam, but we still love this game.
---
I swapped it in with dodgey 2. I'm thinking I will just go back to dodgey 3 I think
---
Agree to disagree. I like this mode a lot, Much better than fortnight
---
You should probably try out the raids before saying there‚Äôs nothing to do.  SBQ was challenging this time last year, when 95% of the participants weren‚Äôt level 200+ with a bloody automatic.  In any continually updated game, the balance tends to skew towards the players and year old end game content becomes Tuesday at the office.
---
The raids aren‚Äôt super hard, and can be made easier by utilizing specific perks like Enforcer, but they‚Äôre a decent challenge if you‚Äôre going solo or carrying some less experienced players.
---
8: Companions that ACTUALLY follow you around the wasteland, even if it‚Äôs a dog or a mole rat, robot would be perfect something we can make our own and mod like in fo4
---
I don't like the challenge cause sloths are my favorite animal and I don't want to shoot one.
---
You didnt play eso did you
---
Visited a player camp in the cranberry bog last night. After leaving with some items I came across 2 legendary scorchbeast. Ran back and grabbed the guy at his camp and we took them down. Left the fight then immediately came across an albino deathclaw fighting a group of super mutants. Not as crazy as your encounter but still  a joyful few moments in an otherwise dull night.
---
Nope. Wouldn't be exclusive if that was possible.
---
The basic premise is that if you crouch, you get a 1 second Stealth Boy.
---
It's worth noting that some tasks in the game, like hacking terminals, force you to stand.  This is pretty evident if you're doing a missile silo and didn't kill the turrets in the room before hacking.  They will be alerted to your presences the moment you interact with the terminal.  Using a workbench is probably similar, although sidling up to it and doing Scrap All shouldn't be.
---
You‚Äôre absolutely right. It‚Äôs really pathetic that some individuals would dupe/cheat/exploit in the game world in order to get a sense of imaginary achievement, something probably impossible to get in real life.
---
True again! Well seems i will have to wait for atom shop again
---
I don‚Äôt know about that, I haven‚Äôt seen similar names pop up and servers always seem full. Could be a time of day thing. But yea they said they combined servers for faster match making.
---
Yeah it gives you the plan to make a new one on the armor bench, it maxes out at 30lbs for a level 50 character and the normal is 60lbs for level 50 without mods. The keycard to open the door to get upstairs to get the plan is in the hand of the dead cop sitting on the other side of the wall with a hole in it in the basement. You can loot it through the gap in the wall, hope this helps.
---
Shouldn't have to wait too long, I missed the greenhouses last time and I think it was only 2 months or something until they popped back up, and the Free States stuff was around the same time as those IIRC.
---
Why are you carrying weeks worth of junk?
---
Wastelanders should come with an account wide banker
---
The arms are missing others as well, and I have unlocked all the upgrades.
---
Like a few weeks ago there was a dupe script that was out for like a week. A group pooled a bunch of items and duped them in mass with the goal of crashing the economy.
---
&gt;Does the purpose it was once added for, still be required now?
---
VATS is now pretty much as the Vault Dweller would have seen it.  It's a spur-of-the-moment aim assist. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The only real problem I have with VATS is that it could use a bit more stickiness when an NPC moves behind a solid object.  Give me a 0% chance of hitting it, but don't break my target lock over a tree, please.  That, and sort out the solidarity of chain-link fences.
---
I've been playing it for the last few weeks on PS4. Also bought for a bargain (\~$16 ) and after spending some time with it I feel like it was well worth it.  I was asking if it was even worth playing at first too, because it was a huge download to install and I had issues with it crashing on login. 
---
There's a huge world to explore and most players I've run into have been cool and most are doing their own thing.  It will probably crash from time to time - but if you just want a sort of ambient apocalypse experience it's pretty fun, especially for $12.
---
It would be really weird to play the game with yourself even though it isn‚Äôt actually you though
---
You might consider contributing to the wiki over at [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_Wiki](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_Wiki)
---
Wiki articles have a lot more permanency than reddit posts and it would allow others to collaborate and expand on any work that you do. I'm not saying don't post here, but it may be good to contribute to both communities. If you're on discord, I can get you in touch with the fallout wiki team for assistance if you need it.
---
It's a bug.  They know about it.
---
In the meantime, don't try aiming at each one.  Just sweep past all of them while mashing E or whatever.  The game will generally get the hint.
---
Ah yes, I, too, like the event "One violet night".
---
People like them because they are rare. They are also light so it's an easy way to carry a lot of "money".
---
That weird enclave music is ‚ÄúHail to the Chief,‚Äù and sometimes I wish it would stop playing.
---
I realized this after.  Thank you
---
I guess that depends on your needs and personality. I'm an introvert and I prefer to play solo just as much as other people prefer playing in teams ;)
---
I love the concept of VATS, and I use VATS often. But could VATS be made better? What if there was a permanent mode when you aimed down the scope it highlighted enemies with hit chance on body parts? I feel like VATS is quite clunky to use at times unless you're sniping and just taking out targets at distance.
---
It‚Äôs a game man. It‚Äôs not a job. 0/10 try at a false equivalency there.
---
think about it from a story telling point of view, we came out the vault, everyone died or left the area, time passes we kick scorchbeast ass, their number dwindle, humanity returns.
---
hopefully wastelanders is successful enough so that they continue that style of episodic story telling.
---
No, that's pretty unimaginative.
---
Use your stash box next time. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs for.
---
People should stop carrying 1000 pounds in their stupid looking excavator armors...played 1200h , took 8 month break. Crashed under 20 times
---
Oh man. You don‚Äôt get rewards for that. Save your ammo. You are better off using the all rise from the quest line and scrip your gun.
---
Wow. Mainframe cores. That‚Äôs vintage. I used to use my Gatling Gun on them. Guess that wouldn‚Äôt work anymore. Lame!
---
Yea you need to fix your build, i dont even use any rifle perks and i get more dmg than that. That said, she has a flat 70% dmg reduction plus armor.
---
I suspect there's some mystery to be solved with it mysteriously playing in that spot.
---
Missing the good old days with organized group farming
---
I have made a Mega Sloth my pet 7x in this game. 4x pre-patch, so those we‚Äôre expected to die. After the patch, the longest one ever survived was 2 real time days. Environmental kills every time. I wish the sloth would spawn at like a level 91 or something. At least give it a chance to survive as a pet.
---
Then you aren't really using VATS.
---
Like, take Camden Park for example.  The moment I set foot on park grounds, I VATS the nearest Scorched and target their head.  Boom, headshot.  Now, as I move around the park, I can basically VATS -&gt; headshot, VATS -&gt; headshot, VATS -&gt; headshot, for every single Scorched.  Everyone is dead before the first one hits the floor.  That, to me, is a pretty good manifestation of what a realistic VATS might look like.  It becomes integrated into my combat routine, rather than this different mode I enter into.
---
BOS jumpsuit? I‚Äôll give you a good offer for that one.
---
I‚Äôve found that if you wait a minute or two, it starts working.   I think it‚Äôs still loading or something.
---
Like all of those guys with that super rare bloodied explosive gatling plasma who kill the SBQ in the time it takes me to get past the fast travel glitch and spend 35 caps to travel to the event.
---
My only reward is to get the chance to catch a glimpse of  this bloodied explosive gatling plasma that is so super rare that only a few thousand players have them.
---
Thanks bloodied explosive gatling plasma guy..... you're the coolest.
---
Not everyone wants to speak to your squeaker ass
---
I have every rare mask besides the sun. I'm pretty sure they were mass duped.
---
I wish I could just find the plans üòÇ
---
And not everyone wants their screen filled with your bullshit chit chat
---
Eh doesnt matter really pc is literally a lawless wasteland where a good chunk of the players just do what they want
---
I joined :)
---
Can you buy the robot armor plans anywhere?
---
Didn't one get it and pose with his Excavator PA?
---
Pretty much, i dont PvP so its not like im gonna be doing any damage with it, and its like pandoras box now on PC, the dupe box was opened and theres no undoing that damage now.  
---
If they ever come up with a permanent fix to it, i might make it my mission to collect and destroy all or as many of the legacy weapons as possible
---
Not that I know of. If he did, it‚Äôs from the dev room.
---
In this case, Bethesda itself earn this shit, the drop rate was a piece of crap.
---
Unfortunatly yes that is the only way.
---
Yep, I do.
---
I mean in game there isnt a dupe but you really cant stop external cheating its just not gonna happen
---
Move stick slightly to walk. Move stick all the way to run. Push in stick to sprint.
---
If you know someone will be staying on the server you can drop items into a container in the world and log into another character and pick it up. It's risky.
---
But it's not rare anymore.
---
Just saw two vendors have the red hat for 6k &amp; $6250.  Also pink hats for $500 &amp; $600.  Oh and yellow hats for $300.  Haven‚Äôt run into anybody selling dresses.  I‚Äôm selling my hats way cheaper compared to those two...Forest $5, green $10, pink $15 and yellow $20.  I‚Äôve sold multiple copies.  Haven‚Äôt scored any color dresses though in my 10 plus runs through Defiance
---
They aren't awesome. They will be collecting dust in your stash box in a week.
---
They were awesome because they were rare and only because they were rare.
---
You should probably stop referring to them as 'rare masks'.
---
I didn't know this
---
Damn, that is a shame lol. Thanks, you too!
---
No
---
All that is needed is in the base game, there is a few convenience items in the atoms shops, but you gets atoms for free while playing. Won't need to buy anything extra at all.
---
Not as rare, sure. It‚Äôs a cool mask to me that I doubted I‚Äôd ever have the option to even acquire, so it‚Äôs rare enough for me. Plus, I‚Äôm certain I could sell it for twice the amount I paid if I put it in my vendor.
---
If you play this game a lot and enjoy multiple characters/playstyles, it‚Äôs definitely worth having two accounts. As a hoarder it made my experience so much more enjoyable. I use my second account to do most of my selling and have 4 maxed cap mules which also stockpile legendaries and large quantities of aid items.
---
Adding suggestions to something that is probably 100% decided on months ago? They probably have the entire wastelanders voice acting done along with the story, just fixing it up and polishing.
---
Only on pc, on console you need the online service for the console.
---
It‚Äôs probably a combo of a b/e or f/e lmg coupled with strangler armor.  Either that or a legacy heavy.  The explosive damage on legacies is stupidly strong, but a b/e lmg will chew through everything really fast.
---
It's a shame the things they were planning were nowhere near ready before launch. The voting booths are weird too. I'm hopeful for things to come.
---
Armor gives great damage protection but has the side effect of giving you constant radiation damage. Load up on radaway or become one of us... One of us,  one of us, Gooble gobble
---
They were extremely rare, and were priced that way. They were also a reward for Halloween and became much less rare. Old info seems to be keeping price high for now.
---
Seems like a waste of display space. You should put a slice of preserved pie in there instead.
---
Always good to meet a fellow wastelander. I could have used a bit of help yesterday tbh.
---
I don't really bother with rad resistance chems. A lot of people farm radshields, and other rad resistance chems, but diluted radaways are so easy to find/make, that You only need to get good at using them from the quick wheel.  Healing factor negates enough of the rad removal, that diluted radaway keeps me between 10-20%
---
I tried but wasn't successful with this daily this time but in addition to the most excellent tip above a Mega Sloth can also spawn east of Watoga just across the river on the way to the train yards.
---
Man, I‚Äôd give Bethesda my left nut to be able to boil water at a brewing station... sure do love that water!
---
yeah that's the big hurdle for consoles.  hell I try to keep up with a controller on PC but it's not even close
---
Was this on pc? If so, i doubt it's legit.
---
Never thought of that! Thank you I will definitely look into it!
---
Meh. Not really my taste to build under.
---
pets should be like the scrapbot
---
This is a win for Bethesda.
---
Rare in game items are intended as a skinner box mechanism to keep people playing the game and grinding for 'rare' loot. When loot gets duped it forces the Atom store apparel to be the only true rarity in the game.
---
Duped weapons on the other hand hurt Bethesda because there is no option to buy weapons in the Atom store.
---
I suggest you lead line all your armour pieces and try to find some with rad resist. I can run through a nuke zone like this using a couple of radaways. (75 rad resist total on mine and i use radx diluted during the queen fight)
---
They make rads much more manageable around ghouls too
---
Yea i get how bloodied builds work but when 80% of my health bar is rads i dont wanns soak up any more
---
here here my good mad
---
You mind telling me the name of the guys üëÄ
---
Only thing that would mitigate that is RR armor. Which I think is broken.
---
Thanks ill try get my hands on some lead lined mods
---
I guess I just don‚Äôt see the point of how that makes it less cool to have the jester mask if someone wants it.
---
im guessing the leveling thing is because some weapons start off in level increments of 5 and just go up by 10 each time. as for the bob, i agree. it needs a bit more to it. maybe some mods.
---
Oh really any idea of when thats getting fixed
---
Wow.
---
"Woah, nice paint job! How'd you do it?"
---
"Paint? Oh, i just didn't clean it after my last fight with a scorchbeast queen."
---
Just for clarification. You cannot fight inside the nuke zone without PA. This just helps you when you spawn deep inside the nuke zone so you run out of it.
---
For PA i recommend emergency protocols as a torso mod. It helps a lot too
---
?
---
Oh yea im aware i logged into a nuked whitespings at level 22 wasnt a nice time
---
bloodied will prolly fetch 1200-2400
---
Lead lined backpack mod is all you need for most stuff. Maybe a rad shield for melee on the queen.
---
Strong agreement.
---
Ill pop a radex diluted if i know im fighting swarms of ghouls that can mob me (burrows,ws), other then that i dont worry much.
---
Never heard this idea before but I really like it a lot.
---
Yeah they where mass duped
---
The lvl is irrelevant. If it went up to lvl 50 it still wouldnt do shit.
---
Actual scorched variance of all the armors would be nice
---
Yeah, I have no desire to have Xbox flooded with the dupers and cheaters of PC. Not saying console doesnt have there own issues but lets not comingle issues. 2 half busted platforms doesn't make a whole.
---
No idea. Been broken for months.
---
Good ol charm of bethesda
---
Yet
---
Yay get grind more back pack quests
---
Its pathetic that people are still playing the game...
---
So long as you aren't seen by the enemy you can move around as quickly as you like, if you want stealth damage, you just pop into a crouch when ever you shoot. 
---
(Also going back into a crouch can put you back at a caution instead of danger, if you can break line of sight with the enemy... Unless it's a robot with an enhanced targeting card... That's a little tougher)
---
Just use a Pyschobuff or other HP altering chem/product.
---
I quit basically when F1st came out. I guarantee this shit still isn't fixed. It's been in the game since BETA.
---
Just take a Psychobuff or something and until it wears off you just sort of... bank up rads. It keeps you at Nerd Rage procs but not max damage at 10%. I used BioCommMesh on my chest and the perk for long times. One was more than enough for an SBQ.
---
and collect PA at the same time when you cook more than a minute.
---
I'd take cross-save over cross-play. It'd be nice if my Bethesda account wasn't a separate entity across platforms, atom shop included.
---
Berserker actually performs *below* the baseline stats if you wear armor, and explosive is mostly worthless against the Queen.  If you aren't Bloodied, you need to bring something like an Anti-Armor Gatling Gun.  Or, somewhat easier to grab, a Zealot, Hunter, or Executioner.  That's still a flat +30/50% damage boost without perks.
---
Same. Honestly, I just wish more people would step out of the meta in general. It feels like half of the high level players I see are all using the exact same set/weapons.
---
I have all 4 they are mass duped and if you were in a certain trader friend group there‚Äôs a very high chance you have all of them
---
My understanding/experience as of late is that it is fixed.  It‚Äôs just not a huge nuke-zone surviving boost, and honestly nothing will be.  You need radshield or some diluted rad-x for nuke zones, or just ask yourself why bother haha.  Most queen fights are pulled out of the zone so if it‚Äôs just flux farming, I just suck it up and suit up.
---
I personally run aquaperson so I can swim as-desired, though I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs mandatory.  Outside of nuke zones (and toxic valley if you go there) water is my only source of annoying high level rads.
---
I have a backup gun on both of my melee characters.  It‚Äôs just inevitable that you‚Äôll need to hit something from far away, be it a paper target, a scorchbeast, a distant legendary that will die by the time you get close, or some enemy shooting you from a balcony or cliff.
---
In my experience, having a backup gun is just a necessity sometimes, but you can make it do more than just shoot bullets.
---
Because the gun is secondary, my power armor slugger also uses it as a Speed Demon effect without the food/drink penalty.  In agility there‚Äôs a perk called Gun Runner.  If you‚Äôre willing to deal with low pistol damage just to tag enemies and shoot while closing distance, the perk is fantastic.  Pistols are very efficient with VATS, so they can be a good option for players that aren‚Äôt good at aiming or don‚Äôt want to aim for whatever reason.
---
A suppressor/explosive 10mm or revolver is actually really good as a weapon when melee is your skill set.  The ammo is plentiful and AP cost is tiny per shot.  With Gun Runner, you run 20% faster while holding it and with the suppressor effect, your enemy does 20% less damage when you shoot it.  The explosive effect will also apply suppression to any enemy caught with splash damage, as well as tag legendaries during events without killing them outright.  I have a 10mm and I like it a lot.  The DPS is bad, just plain bad, but it‚Äôs there almost exclusively as utility until I can start swinging the hammer.
---
Thank you, i‚Äôm currently at university for games design so i‚Äôm constantly thinking of ideas
---
Too many cheaters and exploiters on PC
---
Search ‚Äúwhere to get robot armor plans‚Äù in this sub.  I‚Äôd link it but don‚Äôt know how on the phone.  Has a good video (not mine) of about a dozen robot armor plan spawn points.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why they can‚Äôt just buff the weapon.
---
How do you even find out about that sort of thing?
---
Exactly this
---
Well, if Bethesda varied it every now and then...
---
We've had a whole year of what's essentially the same meta.  It's an objectively superior meta.  They could have nerfed it, or brought other prefixes more in-line with it (for example, Berserker).  They've done neither.  So, after all this time, what else would you expect players to do?
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Spending caps is entrely optional.
---
Or an auction house!
---
Tbf the overwhelming majority of players don‚Äôt participate in that sort of thing, either by  choice or ignorance. 
---
The only stuff that sells at my camp is bulk junk and some plans, which mainly newer players need.
---
I'll do you one better: Entering a new server while wearing Excavator armor will give you an extra 100 carry weight until you either leave the armor or die.
---
I'm working on this very same thing at the moment I've got a one handed bloodied melee build. Got everything in a good balance of defence and damage apart from the rads. I've just moved some points into endurance for rad shield so going to try that with diluted rad x. Don't use normal rad x it kills your mutations for the duration
---
Lead lined backpack mod is handy and I pop a dilutted radx when I expect rads to be an issue
---
Lmg was integral to WW2 , It needs a buff outta respect
---
But I'm actually thinking the guy further down is right about just getting good at taking radaway quickly off the wheel, I'm going to give that a go and it may free up the points again..
---
Did we ever get proof the winter mask was legitimate? Or did people just start saying that based on some dubious screenshots? I‚Äôve always wondered.
---
Got a pipe revolver with instigating explosive and +1 agility.
---
Yeah, for research purposes of course
---
delete your ini files then restart the game
---
One-handed melee, in general, could use a boost.
---
Heck, I'd kind of say the same thing about two-handed.  The whole existence of the Talons mutation and the need to only spend 3 points to max out Iron Fist (thus allowing more points in things like Martial Artist and Incisor) gives Unarmed weapons an objective advantage when it comes to damage, on top of being universally Medium speed rather than Slow.
---
Thank you for clarifying.
---
Love that I‚Äôm getting downvoted for that comment. People suck
---
BOS jumpsuit and Forest Camo jumpsuit are still extremely rare. Those two were not a drop during Halloween
---
1st player here, and i farm legendaries when i play to trade for the stuff i want on the market.
---
I like to launch private nukes at WS...usually ill get less than the normal amount of 3\* ghouls, but yesterday,
---
I ran WS 3 times and ZERO legendaries...not 1\*, 2\*,3\* 
---
that being said, I have had my fair share in 1st...I switch between that and PvE to check out vendors for stuff i need. Also, its fun hoarding scrap...
---
It's pvp, getting attacked by a scorchbeast at the end circle is already enough, no need to play pve in a battle royale, just go to adventure...
---
knowing bethesda they'll sell you a whitesprings sentry to guard your camp for 1000 atoms a month.
---
Yeah, those are pretty cool, I need to get some of those somehow
---
I mean I only run a fully ranked Rad Resistance perk on my queen build cause the rads she gives off. I dont take any radiation unless im in the blast zone which is why all my queen armor is lead lined. I got glowing blood packs out the ass too so I pop like 5-10 of those and run around the blast zone collecting flux takin in about +8 rads, just make sure I got extra radaway. Could bring that number down even more but its not worth the resources and im working on a RR Robot set. But for ghouls and stuff I dont have to worry about rads. If your not going use the rad resistance perk then just have glowing blood packs on deck and you‚Äôll be fine. What I do on my second character which is also bloodied.
---
Thanks, I thought it was kinda crappy to devalue all of them. At least a few left worth showing off.
---
I don't know if it's still the case, but I believe being in Power Armor counts as being naked for the purpose of this achievement, so it's not actually that hard to get it.
---
I did it with a friend, we both popped rad-x and radshield and then we could take our time.  Drugs solve all your problems, dude. Just like in real life.
---
Kinda hard to ask the game to cater to a such an inexperienced player. At lvl 55 you shouldbe  lvling up and fixing your build, not gonna be a hero during scorched earth with a bad build.
---
No, it's not.
---
The one that was broken is actually what's now the 25% environmental disease resistance.
---
Moira Brown would be so proud &lt;3
---
I always jump off the top of the bridge at Harper's Ferry. There are some reeds at the base of the first puller that is shallow enough to kill you (with no mutations, pop that rad-x) and get that double rez. No baddies to contend with either.
---
Is this some kind of joke?
---
It's cool.
---
It's not rare.
---
Some of us just want to see a few things remain rare in the game.
---
They really should revamp the challenge system. It's either "pat your head while rubbing your belly" or "shoot a dime in the sky while being struck by lightning and wearing a foil hat".
---
If you go scrap some shit in caution at the tinkers workbench in wes tek you find out it doesnt effect your sneak
---
I only have a few I wish I had cool ones
---
Only sneak perk you need lol, imo.
---
Pretty much this.
---
If you get your rad resist above 100, you'll negate the Queen's radiation aura.  The backpack gets you 90% of the way there.  You can pop a diluted Rad-X, put Lead Lined on a piece of armor, or just find armor with some natural rad resist to cover the rest.
---
Good, good, and good.
---
I know it's objectively superior. I just wish more people felt inclined to experiment more with their builds. Believe it or not, you don't have to two-shot everything to have fun in this game. It especially ruins public events where half of the enemies get killed before you even get a shot in.
---
Lmao... Yeaaah I've never got one of those...
---
What you dont like rad worms?
---
Come over to Xbox man. These are rare here. It doesn‚Äôt make the game any better for me.
---
Since you already think it is a shitshow why do you care about those things?
---
The game isn‚Äôt as bad as people make it odd to be, it‚Äôs immersive, connection is pretty good and there‚Äôs plenty to do well into level 100+
---
the nukes are quite disappointing in this game, launched 15+ nukes and lose the interest because it doesn't even change the environment, oh boy high level enemies and a cloud, but when you go in it all looks the same just shitty radioactive textures, no ground change from a huge ass nuke dropping on it. Kind of a bust that legendary drops have been quite shit lately...
---
All im saying is I wouldnt waste shit like a disease cure on such a...profitless disease.
---
The prices will go back up slowly.
---
I play on PC and was at an SBQ the other day.  There were no less than five players with legacy plasmas and strangler armor.  One wasn‚Äôt even level 100 yet.  Not that he couldn‚Äôt give himself a legacy off another character, but it would be pretty hard to do enough raids to earn the full armor set without breaking lvl 100.  BGS is going to have a lot of problems if they don‚Äôt stop the duping soon.
---
I also saw a camp that was selling three star explosive rifles in stacks of five, for 50c each, not even trying to conceal the dupe.  Same effects, same condition bar, stacked like stimpaks.  It‚Äôs absurd.
---
Ya it is fun to just play with different weapons, optimal play fits the grind but grind is boring. Having more fun in my game turning low level garbage into piles of caps as my meta game.
---
I've seen this a few times myself, for sure dupes. The chances of dropping were so infinitesimally rare for one of the masks for them to have all four is statistically impossible. It's cool to see them though!
---
The same reason you can tell the rest of the masks are fake. They‚Äôre on console, although heavily duped, console players cannot cheat in items. I‚Äôm not entirely sure whether the old man winter mask is legitimate or not, however it‚Äôs duped so it doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
Only effective way to stop it would be to either give every item a unique id or check if people have more than 1 of a rare item
---
You're right, Bethesda already said the drop rates will be higher next Faschnacht
---
It‚Äôs already pretty powerful. I had a BE one and oh boy, it was like one big never ending explosion.
---
I've got a 3* unicorn quad explosive radium rifle on PC that nobody else has.
---
It doesn't make the game any better but it is extremely satisfying to know that I have something unique. I feel like that is what Bethesda intended for this game before duping.
---
\*\*\*\*Short list\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
---
I want legendary perk cards.  you get one for every 50 lvl's, and it can have two attributes, but only costs one slot.
---
I want higher scrip limit/day. 
---
I want higher CAMP budget
---
**I want Wastelanders to be awesome and give us great new ways to play.**
---
There are builds that can basically one-shot the Scorchbeast Queen... and pretty much get one-shot themselves.  So, there's a sliding scale here of viability versus damage, you see. üòâ
---
Yea the servers are pretty good anymore and the community as a whole is probably the most helpful. Granted you have those few undesirables but even they aren‚Äôt that bad if you‚Äôre not thin skinned.
---
You can always use a courier as well. 
---
Dropping items is risky. I lost 100K 5.56 that way. Lesson learned.
---
better than the people fishing for clicks on youtube by watching videos from beta/what happened with the rum/bags and jus recapping it, i've played since day one and i'm still here -- now with a fallout 1st sub.
---
more weapons / mods in general
---
Lol.. Its actually shortened from "Sunshine Moonbeam Death God".. I joked around when I was a kid and told people it was my Native American name or what I would name my child one day.. Haha was semi emo later on, but honestly I was more of a classic rock hippie wannabe for the longest time.....
---
Yea yea, TMI.. Lol
---
can someone remind me the name of the mask on the far right? looks dope as hell
---
I wasn't making a statement about the duping, just that it is why they're popping up more now.
---
It would be great if they could do that, but they‚Äôd also need to hire a bunch of GMs to examine player inventories and actually investigate reported behavior.  Given the graceful efficiency of their customer service, I‚Äôm picturing a 1930s era FBI gang busting squad being asked to keep bystander fatalities to a minimum.
---
If you have an OG Xbox 1, you'll have a lot of lag issues.
---
I play on an X with a wired connection, and aside from some slight NW lag at times, I don't have any issues. You will still get the occasional disconnect or freeze.
---
I regularly sell disease cures and antibiotics to people, diseases can be annoying.
---
Rads are not necessarily bad, you Can get useful mutations, for instance I randomly got healing factor the other day and basically never needed to heal other than food/thirst bars. Taking Radaway will cure your mutations. I also sell lots of radaway in my shop because my current character is a purist.
---
Another thing I like to do is have my favorite wheel be a couple of weapons and then my 'menu' for the day. Usually whatever food items I have a ton of with nice buffs, healing salves, radx, and purified water. I am always wandering thru areas with at least five different buffs. After a firefight it makes it quick to reapply your buffs and heal up quickly.
---
Since I always use food and water I pretty mich never use stimpaks unless I am helping a group. Cooked meat is your best source of health although simple razorgrain soup is a simple to make way to keep all your health/food/water bars constantly full.
---
It's sad that you'd still frequent a subreddit for a game you don't play.
---
Also carry a pistol or something with low damage it‚Äôs what I do
---
It is really powerful. I can get 200 damage out of my bloodied faster fire rat at full health and i can empty the 75 round mag in 10 seconds
---
Convert the railway to an auto, use a reflex sight to cut AP usage, and get a recoil compensating stock. Now it will destroy supermutants, robots and SB's as long as you have all the commando build perks set up. It should easily fetch 25k.
---
One less thing to target , I say roll with it
---
Welcome
---
That's because  they are
---
Sux man! Been there. Nice benefit to 1st: U can blue screen and quit fo76 entirely. Come back in to private world and renter to silo.
---
I run an AA FFR 90% redux and its good but not as good as it should be, 10 seconds seems a bit long lol
---
...while in a rad storm
---
I use an OG Xbox and rarely have any lag issues beside a rare game crash
---
Seems legit
---
One of my teammates has them. He paid real money for the four and received a laser musket "for free"...
---
no, vats is hip fire
---
Was this on xbox? Lol
---
You're lucky, I lost two friends to lag on theirs.
---
Stealth Commando is really meta right now.
---
Vats is neither hipfire nor aim down sights.. It's it's own thing.
---
How about instead of caps to fast travel it was purified water? Min of 1 max of 5 depending on the distance. 
---
But Yeah it's daft that I have to switch between chemistry and brewing benches all the time.
---
Congratulations, you have seen behind the curtain to know why Bethesda has designed it this way. Hopefully your new eyes will make it easier to see the angles when the publishers pull this in other games.
---
lol what??
---
I don't think it does. So it's only really good for heavy weapons and snipers. Explosive is always better. But I still love my bloodied 10% aim RW lever action sniper.
---
a concern nobody has thought of about voice chat is that people can record your voice and use deepfake style AI to replicate your voice and scam your elderly parents and whatnot.
---
I don't get why people are angry that F76 keeps chugging along and people enjoy it
---
Poor bastard. I had it where i laumched my 2nd ever nuke, then got the, server is shutting down, notification!
---
By selling them in your Camp vending station or by selling them to the robot vendors?
---
Why cant they use a script similar to what tf2putpost did with hat i.d. and it kept track of owners by way of i.d. and their script. Idk the whole of it. Just a thought.
---
There‚Äôs one on PC but I shit you not the dude is charging $1k USD to get it
---
We need pyromaniac back, of they could extend demolition  expert to flame weapons. Either would make the flamer fuel grind worth it..
---
Ive seen the jester but never realized it was in the game...
---
Great selection! I love seeing people's displays.
---
Yeah but YOU know that nothing is rare on PC right? That‚Äôs my point. If I played on PC and saw someone selling these masks for 30,000 caps I‚Äôd laugh to myself, find a duper, and ask them to make a few of them for me for free. 
---
Sure, ignorance is bliss I guess, but anyone who spends much time on this sub or fb/discord groups knows that nothing on PC is rare. Thus, has no value.
---
I have all 3 except the clown one and I can‚Äôt find it anywhere so it makes me mad
---
I've never launched one (lvl 186) because something like that happened to me the first time I tried, many levels ago.
---
I've seen players wear the heater mask and old man winter mask, but didn't even know about the other two.  If they did get into the dev room, I'm not sure I would advertise the fact.
---
I like doing whatever I want. Whether that‚Äôs playing around in my camp, grinding for legendaries, wandering around the bog looking for trouble, experimenting with different builds, vendor hopping etc. No two days are the same, and that‚Äôs what I like about it.  
---
One of my favorite things to do is to pretend fast travel doesn‚Äôt exist.  Which way am I wandering today?
---
Lol, if you wanted to buy one, look on ebay, they‚Äôre $15. It‚Äôs not worth it, but it‚Äôs just for comparison.
---
My favorite discovery is Tonga town when we where randomly walking
---
Depends. Hope that helps.
---
I'm inclined to agree. Hated duping all way back with tf2 and other games as well. But when Beth skews the odds purposefully and or refuses to fix a obvious issue with drop rates, it's makes it harder to defend. Players will always find a way to even the field and then some. Irregardless, there will always be a few bad actors.
---
So how about this. One large empty building that teams can use together. Pre-wired with crafting benches and a fusion generator already placed. Teams can use it and it gets a larger build area similar to workshops. Allows teamates to each share in the budget, maybe allowed 10 pct more than your normal camp. Basically giving teams 140 pct more budget.
---
The "pre-built" structure would be in game which should help with loading and lag. All you would really be doing is decorating and creating defenses. 
---
The team camp only activates when the team leader activates it through menu options.
---
I thought the 10% proxies with sights or hip fire or even vats? It has been awhile but recall watching where basically the 10% is always applied unless it‚Äôs been fixed in a recent patch?
---
Theirs a small list in the videos description of the daily challenges I did, that personally don't take long to do.
---
Their very handy for low levels and just something I thought to share.
---
Makes perfect sense.
---
Hip fire accuracy raises vats chance to hit
---
The x box community is 50% scamming bags of grieving thieving Shit  and 50% Decent , fun loving, charming individuals
---
Rad shield, glowing blood pack and bloatfly loaf. Helps to have some rad res armour too. Radx is useless. Radx diluted won't suppress your mutations but it won't stack with the above I don't think. Good for general use though.
---
Oh and also anything boosts endurance will give you a natural RR.
---
If anything 1st makes the game less enjoyable. It's p2w and takes away what little challenge there is.
---
There's no differentiation between one- and two-handed, is the problem (besides cards).
---
Why can't One-handed melee wield a garbage can lid or some other 'wasteland' junk as a shield?
---
Pretty normal.
---
One of those year old unfixed launch bugs
---
I‚Äôm sorry to hear that mate, I hope you can get it sorted soon
---
The nukas plant should be a workshop that makes them , like the ammunition factory makes ammo
---
This is correct. It applies in hip fire, sighted aim, and vats
---
Good point!
---
When's the last time you saw someone using Legendary Dragon?
---
You don't because I think they were either removed from the legendary loot table, or made more rare. Much the same with other weapons like the shishkebab.
---
Check whitespring chef again his stock appears to rotate
---
Most likely to other players, they were a really hot item at one point
---
I don‚Äôt believe they carry mods.  Plans, yes.  
---
Been awhile though.
---
You‚Äôll be completely mental after 5 minutes.
---
I've heard this rumor, but never seen them there personally. I checked for several weeks after the event.
---
Or make an event like Feed The People, where you have to make the Nuka, but have to fend off waves of enemies.
---
Sorry forgot to mention. I checked him everytime I joined a world, I am aware it rotates, that is why I think he doesn't have it
---
Frequent? Posts come up on my feed from time to time. I supported the game up until launch heavily. There are way too many games out there for me to keep sinking time into a huge disappointment, doesnt mean I have to unsub.
---
Now imagine a SBQ with a Liberty Prime PA, a MrFuzzy PA, and the Horse PA from the Fo4 CC... We're gonna need bigger asylums because we would all go nuts. That being said, I like the idea.
---
This would work also
---
What recipe are you missing?
---
My point was, like garlandtd I've played games since the first Nintendo, Sega genesis,  the original dooms on pc in 90's lol yeah I'm a little older too... but none have ever addicted me so much that I keep playing just cause I find something so awesome and completely unexpected and let's me destroy anything in seconds. Not even mentioning making and modding different badass power armors, guns, randomly wandering seeing different stuff every time even after a year playing, and the other 100s of things I can do every time I get on. What other game's are like that?
---
Are you on PS4?  I‚Äôll give you any cooking 
---
recipes I have that you don‚Äôt
---
That's the thing, I don't know which one I am missing
---
Vending machine. People didnt know you learned the plan if you scrapped one, so same ppl bought a lot. lol
---
Depends on what you‚Äôre looking for.  Largely basic stuff is in whitespring.  Factions have their own mods and rotating inventories of a few items as well.
---
Dense plans I‚Äôve seen in watoga, harpers ferry and the ash heap. Have yet to see them in TV, the forest, or the divide.
---
The only ones I‚Äôve seen are the skeleton mask on the far right and old man winter. Xbox as well
---
Yea im in the process of stocking up on unyielding armor with the +1 endurance bonus so my lowest special stats will be around 12 or 13
---
Just on pc?
---
Good point lol. Last night got a worthless 1 star sword, maybe 2 two star armors 3... can't remember last 3 star I got from her
---
Speak for yourself, I could use a cold, refreshing VIM.
---
Sorry, PC. Thanks though!
---
Yeah pc European region
---
What platform are you on? LOL
---
Hmm I could a sworn there was a check list that showed you what you were missing. But I just check and there not. Did you collect all the healing and disease cure recipes?
---
lol I use a Dragon *and* a Shishkebab. But I don't think the Shishkebab was removed from legendary pools, it's just kinda lousy.
---
Pc feel free to come to my base my ign is Black+Cat
---
Um, the only time I use PA is when I'm plumbing the depths for lead.
---
Nuke zones = hazmat suit.  I fight very well inside nuke zones with it, even as a bloodied build with not much room on the healthometer.
---
Go to change appearance and your head will reload
---
The xbox players are fabulous. 7 players were in uranium fever event, we all tagged the legendarys with weak shotguns looted from meatpiles.
---
Players mutated with 3 certain bad mutations are still unknowingly tricked into pvp.
---
It's a survival game no matter how much people wish it wasn't. It's important that the game keep rewarding food and water. I mean if you're fresh out of a vault what kind of payment do you want? I'd like some food and water. What I absolutely HATE as quest rewards are all of the regular weapons and armor. This is what I think should be the rewards in events: food and water, plans, or legendary/unique items
---
I think this is a good idea, and could be added as a private world feature, or as a clan/pack/guild/gang expansion, but I don‚Äôt know how it would work logistically if the camp wasn‚Äôt persistent in the world, kinda like a workshop.  I don‚Äôt work on the game, I just play it.  
---
As cool as it would be, a world filled with a dozen player made villages undoubtedly poses challenges, and it needs to be well planned and fully thought through.  As it is now, camps still need a lot of basic fixes.  Simply putting a wire fence with a gate around your mutfruit tree is the stuff of nightmares.  How would we ever cordon off a garden built by a community?
---
If I guessed, I‚Äôd say that 2020 is going to be largely spent relaunching the game with Wastelanders, fixing new and old bugs and working towards a stable reinvention of the game with mistakes of 2019 guiding future decisions.  At least, that is my hope.
---
If anything, they‚Äôll probably start adding expansions to ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù content this time next year or 2021.  I say secondary because while I deeply appreciate the artistry that goes into some amazing homes I see, technically a player could complete the main quest line without every setting up a camp. That doesn‚Äôt make camping less important than fighting, just that the path from leaving the Vault to eliminating the scorchbeast queen would be impossible without being able to move or hit things.  You‚Äôll still freeze in Vault 94 if you exit power armor, and some people have guns that don‚Äôt work properly.  Stuff like that needs priority.
---
Wastelanders will undoubtedly come with its own collection of problems, too.  As long as they don‚Äôt send half the team off to build something entirely different, and keep a handle on managing bugs as they appear, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see a shit show like last summer again.  That may be wildly optimistic on my part, but I‚Äôm hoping they learned from past mistakes.  Year one was filled with ambitious experiments, so some failure should be expected.  Without it, no wisdom is gained.
---
Now that armor-piercing for energy damage has been fixed, it's not the worst in terms of raw damage. It stacks up nicely compared to some other legendary one-handed melee weapons I've got, although obviously that weapon class isn't the most "meta" compared to fist weapons.
---
It can keep the split damage, what would really make it worthwhile is a decently strong burning DoT effect. Plus that would make it more fun to hit stuff with.
---
Damn, Xbox, appreciate it tho
---
Yeah i agree, i use it too sometimes. Was just letting him that rad resist armour isn't sufficient by itself for that...
---
Not sure though if any combo of chems can actually make it possible
---
If you have a good RR you could probably just use bramin milk as an all in one supply for food water and removing rads as it only takes off a small amount of rads.
---
I had a similar problem and had missed one of the Delberts recipes early in the game. Check all those and see if you are missing one
---
‚ÄúKnight Moreno, to I guess no one...‚Äù
---
for a survival game the wasteland is literally showered with food and water
---
Life-saving Berserker with broken armor, Revenant and berserker would give you the same damage bonus as Bloodied. Any perk that says "when you revive a player" or "when you are revived by a player" is affected by Life Saving and Mysterious Savior, also Dry Nurse works with those so it's essentially giving you free stimpacks. Between five pieces of life saving and Mysterious Savior you have 6 chances to be picked up so plenty of survivability
---
No idea. That character got erased months ago. Didn't know they were that special back then.
---
so it seems they did answer you? it cannot be fixed? they obviously gave you that answer more than once before they started ignoring your tickets...
---
I remember this post
---
Sounds like an amazing time
---
I run the asylum quite often farming for outfits.
---
I agree with Baronik on most of his prices.  
---
Hats are common and go in my vendor for 15 caps each.
---
 I have 8 clean white outfits in storage and I've dropped my price to 50 caps and I'd say fair value is max 100 caps.  
---
  I've found 1 red.  It's tough to find.  I get asked to sell or trade it all the time, constantly.  It's the highest demand clothing piece in the game - I heard one recently sold for 200k caps and I think a fair value is 50k to 75k caps.
---
The rest of his values are pretty accurate, when he says up to that's the high end of prices and they can sell for less.
---
Lmao...I recognize Mando from disc golf. That means mandatory
---
Yeah but tbh unless you go farming it's not really enough to share. Usually just enough to keep your own bars healthy especially with speed demon. But this community is about carebearing with new players, and dropping them so much stuff they're almost overencumbered
---
I don't accept that. First, this is a game from a well established major game developer. Their customer support should be far better than it is. 
---
Second the issue that I am unable to purchase atoms or sign up for the subscription service. I have run through all of their diagnostics and performed all the repairs they say are necessary. Three times. I have been told it was a firewall issue. Bypass the firewall and it still doesn't work. I've been told it's a banking issue and I should contact the payment provider. One bank and 3 different credit cards and none of them see the attempt at purchase. I've been told I need to be on a different network, that my home network is an issue. My friend logged into their account from my computer and made a purchase with no problem. I've logged into my account at a computer well away from my home at the same friend's home. They could make a purchase on their account. I could not on mine. I was told that I should contact Digital River who handles the actual processing of the purchase. They will not talk to or trouble shoot anything and refer me back to Bethesda. 
---
So yes, I am disgruntled with their customer support and for a company that so clearly is business minded I am incredulous that they can't manage to help me throw money at them. But let's be honest, this is par for the course on any type of support ticket if there is any truth to what I posted on this subreddit on a regular basis.
---
You should check it out after Wastelanders releases my guy, they're adding choices and consequences into the game which is gonna be pretty good and will probably win back a lot of the fanbase
---
The problem is a) it's totally random how long it can take, and b) there seem to be highly arbitrary environmental factors that will keep a SB from landing no matter how long you wait or what you do. Bc of something stupid like a tree stump or a 10-degree ground incline or god knows what.
---
Better AI (not holding my breath) or at least a hard time limit forcing them to land at least EVENTUALLY would prevent the need for some SB-landing megaphone or something, but in the current state it's absurdly unreliable.
---
Could maybe see clans or guilds coming with a shared camp between members maybe? Could contribute resources, have someone as a 'master builder' etc
---
Junkie gunslinger?
---
...at night
---
Just like the Liberty Prime armor
---
I understand your frustration, but if they are unable to fix it what do you want them to do? its the first time i‚Äôve honestly ever heard of that kind problem, I doubt they would turn down your money unless they were actually unable to fix it. 
---
on a lighter note, a shared account stash with enough room to transfer any one item at a time is the #1 thing im rooting for, but I want most if your other suggestions aswell
---
I've been playing since release, as well. I still have full servers.  I hop servers, for vendors, and those are all full, too. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
More Nukie Coolies is what this community wants Bethesda
---
Related, I just hit a guy's camp that was selling Plasma Grenade plans, all the backback plans (Had about 10 of each), and 20 of each Faschnacht plans.
---
.
---
Looks like the dupers have found something new and are rolling out the wagon like mad.
---
I think scorched earth should be blocked until players do all bos and enclave quests and main quests and explore the fissure sites and other places where bos soldiers bodies killed by scorchbeasts are everywhere, surface to air missle launchers that take tons of shots to kill them etc. kind of tells the story itself and gives a sense what's coming...
---
No reason they should be able to just fast travel to the end of the game completely unprepared AND make it harder for others
---
About a month old news. Still valuable for those who don't know yet.
---
be more careful
---
I use bloodied combat rifle powerful auto, bloodied handmade powerful auto, bloodied unyielding vats crit sneak build.
---
Shotgun Medic/tank. Medics prefix or vampire , share revenant w/ teammates, so when you revive them, pow. Vangaurds will be in effect almost constantly. Throw on blocker,or serendipity or ricochet, other damage redux, super tanky.
---
Could try making a pistol packin' mamma. Bloodied, junkies, or just sneaky VATS-y.
---
...while riding a mega sloth in the cranberry bog.
---
Didn't even know... hence the video.
---
But cheers for the heads up.
---
Executioner‚Äôs because 2 shot isn‚Äôt great on shotguns.
---
Unless you are on a team, most times a text message is sufficient for general communication.
---
&gt;I want to go back to being able to shoot the mainframe cores in the silo. currently you have to click each one individually.
---
Bethesda has called this out as a bug...hopefully it'll be resolved soon!
---
For #3 - I'd also like channels - a separate "world" channel that you can mute, but also chat on.  Things like:
---
Hey, I'm about to drop a nuke, any preferences on where to put it?
---
Looking to team up for the Paradise event, anybody in?
---
it mostly depends, same with (most) other primary prefixes. 
---
IMO. the best ones for a non-bloodied are Junkies, Furious, and Vampire's. Vampire's and Furious for faster firing weapons
---
This reminds me of Inferno from Beast Wars.
---
\-10% chances these are legit
---
Yeah, perhaps that'll cure me from my addiction of gathering all the available purified water and turning Stimpaks into diluted ones. I have over 3000 and nobody buys them lol
---
Ok are you guys sure about any of that? Use as gatling plasma and laser on queen and damage numbers go up only when actually aiming with reflex sight. "Hip fire" is noticeably lower...
---
id be content with the brew station allowing us to craft nuka products.. and to limit "free caps" make it cost 1 cap to seal the bottle
---
my build is a lot of fun, 8str 8 luck 5 int 15 agi 15 perception, hazmat suit, lots of sneaking around
---
For those who can‚Äôt watch a video rn can you give us a summary
---
That's perfect
---
There is a thought
---
Lmg is the best ranged dps weapon
---
What about the fifth one? Did you see that one at all?
---
Sure can do. Will put it as a main comment.
---
But with that you'll be *patriotically* and more importantly ***capitalistically*** mental /s
---
It must not be an ordered list, I had suppressor unlocked when I was at 27/45. At 35/45 now üòÑ
---
I would love something like this, even if it's just being able to build in the same area (like actual neighbours)
---
PA display options along with a little more camp budget.
---
I only play falloit when my gf does so we really wana combine our camps together to make a good ass home
---
Came here to say this. Have an upvote.
---
I love this!
---
Hi All.
---
I'm aware not everyone can watch videos all the time.
---

It does but alot of ppl think it doesnt. 10% while aiming is best on SBQ becouse you can hit damage treshhold easier
---
Literally posted it as you did lol
---
[deleted]
---
If it's one of Delbet's recipes you're looking for, I find them all over the Tyler county fairgrounds and in flatwoods.
---
I‚Äôm a PC player, and I‚Äôve been finding myself playing in a private world almost exclusively for the past two weeks.
---
Every server is filled with players armed with legacy gatling plasmas.  Events are increasingly difficult to participate in, because most of those players behave like a child with a big new toy they want everyone to see.  
---
I wouldn‚Äôt wish that experience on console players.
---
Executioners.  For what I have, 2 shot seems to miss (or do really low damage) with the 2nd round. 
---
At least executioners hits every time.
---
Very lucky!
---
My expertise is mainly Poseidon powerplant, there's a few outside and a few inside. I would bet it's the same for the other plants
---
I have +100/+200, as if the shocks were not there...
---
IIRC, the drops were broken and a couple had either an astronomically low drop rate (like... Invincible's Reins, but with a 50% less chance, and then another 50% less chance) or straight up weren't dropping at all
---
I have the same issue playing at 5760x1200 across 3 monitors. I try my best to ignore them, sigh.
---
Same it is really annoying are you on PC.
---
Well the main cards are the main cards. After that it becomes personal. I don't use any damage resist or avoidance perks other than serendipity. 2 strength and 2 charisma (that I might take down to 1) so I can have max sneak and several luck perks, such as grim reaper spirit, psychopath, and better criticals.
---
I think the 11/11 number is bugged, as I unlocked a new mod from scrapping last night even though it said I had them all.
---
That‚Äôs a good suggestion too, thanks.
---
Everytime i get a junkie weapon i scrip it, do the benefits outweigh the negative effects all withdrawals?
---
I'll buy the BFFR railway rifle for 5k
---
Hmu
---
Ign: LOOSESPRINGSTEIN
---
This.  I've seen a lot of interiors with boarded up entrances, then I just wait and it seems to load in fine after 30 second or so.
---
Ouch. Is it fixed yet?
---
Are you on Xbox? Because I have one.
---
The travelling Colosseum shall finally be complete!!
---
I have a raider character with pipe revolver rifles and pipe rifles, suck ass armor that I didn't max the stats of, and not a lot of endurance. It makes the game super hard even with the awesome gear I use.
---
You shoud be able to do that, purify boiled or dirty, and use purified water in food for increase bonuses. Like no rads.
---
lol nice
---
My gripe with LMGs is just how hard it is to get ammo. It‚Äôs too junk-intensive to make in bulk, even with maxed out Ammosmith, and scavenging is imo too tedious.
---
Genius
---
Feel free to add me - RokiRoco
---
It's not too bad if you have a few trapper or robot pieces and ween yourself off of the high capacity backpack. I use a rad x diluted for SBQ usually
---
They released the standalone outfits shortly before the Halloween event.
---
It was a week-long event back in Feburary, so we'll find out in about...  3 months.
---
I would love a power amour station where it just chills until you need it and can just enter it.
---
It‚Äôs the Sentinel systems, they‚Äôre goin‚Äô haywire!
---
fwiw the devs have commented on this and said they'll be improving the event and its rewards for next year
---
Try unequipping ur perks and reequip. The lever action too. Might not be that but sometiems it fixes this.
---
That would be more fun than a workshop honestly, could be made a cool event.
---
Might as well ask for a Grafton Mayor power armor
---
If you liked the others, you‚Äôll probably like this one.  It‚Äôs different, but its still fallout.
---
  There is nothing in the atom shop you absolutely must have in order to launch a nuke and defeat the queen.  And you can earn in game ‚Äúatoms‚Äù to acquire stuff from the atom shop.
---
If you are on PS4, The only additional outlay in real money may be a PS plus subscription, which is a requirement for that platform.  (IDK about XB.)
---
The only Silo run I did crashed towards what I think was the end, was fixing the cores.  I haven't done it since.  That was 160 levels ago.
---
it's anecdotal evidence either way. the only "solid" data we have is the PS4 leak that showed the playerbase wasn't that impressive to begin with.
---
Get rid of healing factor. This gives you the freedom to use rad away without gaining health. A bloodied build can get all the health it needs off water to be honest.
---
Back in the day it was due to there being a cap on damage a single player could do you may have down just that even though that is supposed to be gone also if your useing explosive energy weapons it cause the game to get way buggy because it dosent reconginize the guns data
---
I sell the diluted stuff to vendors. Might as well earn a few caps for it!
---
Buy it
---
Id love to transfer stuff across characters. My heavy build has alot of good stuff for a stealth commando but i cant change  my build without needing 50 lvls
---
They already deleted dupes from peoples' inventories before. I'm hoping when Wastelanders or somesuch comes around they'll do another pass like that. As for legacy weapons, I'm guess they'll either be made untradeable or straight up deleted from peoples' inventories like Bottlecap Mines were.
---
I'd settle for a Mr. Fuzzy skin/paint, as we know pre-War companies were already using power armor as ambulatory billboards...
---
That's a fair price imo, especially with wastelands coming soon
---
Weird.. I was using the Tesla Rifle through all 3 runs since I wanted to take a break from heavy weapons (even tho i still carry em just incase since im not specc'd for assault class)  
---
As for damage, i got no cards for the gun i was using too, it was all base damage from the gun the whole 3 runs (67 ish or so) so not sure what happened..   
---
Thanks for the info tho, its much appreciated
---
I'm sick of getting purified water from quests. All I end up doing is selling them to a vendor anyway...
---
gamestop has it for $12
---
10/10 would go mad.
---
I saw another person selling one fore 8k today
---
I need it digital since I game share with a buddy on xbox one
---
ahhh gotchu
---
Yeah. What are you asking? Or any particular trades you want?
---
The bottom line is duping wouldn't exist if things were a little easier to get.
---
I‚Äôve tried that and it didn‚Äôt work.
---
They gave us two free wallpapers, people have been asking for those
---
No not yet that would be cool though like some type of chrome paint or something.
---
I don't really care about console numbers.
---
Vats rolling pin build? üëçüèª
---
I've seen the Flatwoods monster everywhere but flatwoods
---
I think if you wait out the nuke storm just being where it was still counts
---
Yeah, one guy with a sun mask on Twitter. I remember that.
---
I got it when it was 60 dollars and I think it's worth it. Alot of people shit on 76 but I love it. I get to escape the real world and be whoever I want in 76
---
Oh yeah I have had the same problem I just waited a while till the ghouls respawned.
---
You can also upload it to your feed and then download the image directly to your phone with the Xbox app.
---
Lol, I'm basically the same as you, though I haven't done junkies yet. I agree, SBQ and, especially,  the silos have been tougher. I'd sometimes only get a few bot once I did the initial clearing of the command area... the last few silos have been constant waves of Col. Gutsys, various robo-brain types and assaultrons.  I'm still able to handle solo, but they've been hard fought and I've had to use meds multiple times, even with healing factor. I haven't seen that really any other place but those two do seem to be buffed...or maybe I've just grown complacent after doing the silo a couple hundred times and lost focus? That's what I assumed but now I'm not so sure, I just don't recall ever getting a constant flow of higher end bots!
---
Also works.  Also you can kill with syringer using bash damage.
---
I‚Äôve spent hours server hopping through flat woods trying to find this lol. Now I feel dumb
---
How'd he scam you? Details are important to prevent other players from making the same mistakes...
---
I'm going to be on today around 8 o clock us eastern time wanna play them? I'll add u
---
Can you still join a private server? Your F1st might have run out. Try putting down your survival tent maybe
---
Yeah those are outstanding freebies. I do think there aren‚Äôt as much interesting new stuff too, so let‚Äôs hope some new stuff comes.
---
Could it be the creatures armor? Or maybe a disease?
---
I've never had that problem and I launched 3 nukes back to back yesterday on the same server.
---
I have F1 bro but I'm getting error every time in loading
---
There were some posts a while back about something like this T.o.w.n.s or team organization waistland society or something like that. The idea was to have servers blocks in a area we‚Äôre Someone could build and when they logged on they were always put on the same server with the towns they joined
---
I'm kind of the reverse of u. I'm going from a rifle build to bloodied melee... I use the deathclaw gauntlet do u have a good set of perks and specials that u could tell me about
---
Just got mine for metal... 25 caps at player's vendor.  Thanks for the tip!
---
U getting any legendaries?
---
ok but that's not really relevant to the conversation. unless you can prove there's a massive disparity between platforms it's still a good representation of the whole.
---
and if the market is anything to go by, PS4 is actually the most active.
---
Yeah I am but not very many like u normally would get
---
Explain what happened. How did you ‚Äòlose‚Äô the shotgun?
---
Do you have a forest scout mask? Because I‚Äôll trade it for that.
---
If not... well I‚Äôm not sure how much they‚Äôre worth, I‚Äôve seen suits go for different prices. What‚Äôs your budget?
---
np i try to tell all non PA users abot dense mods :)
---
What kind of monster would do such a thing
---
Probably just a bait-and-switch move: took his weapon and left the trade menu before putting his offer item for 0 caps.
---
And its name as well i cant quite read it
---
Yeah and most of people shitting on FO76 never play it.
---
Trust no one ever
---
Part of the problem is that 76 made it so a melee weapon has a strict limit of hitting only one target per swing.  This takes away one of the big advantages 2-handed melee had in 4, which was essentially crowd control when enemies bunched up.
---
I want to lucky the other day.  Someone brought their TSE into the realm.  Only got one legendary because this person had to be that "one guy".
---
Can I pet ur dog. It's a little big but I'm sure it's a softie
---
Yeah...given the resources to do it
---
tried that it worked for the lever action but now my combat rifle if unequipped says 103 damage if I equip it drops to 66
---
You want to run around the wasteland with a necklace of scorched ears around your neck?
---
Check out the pylon place near Watoga, pretty good spot to hop for one
---
Isn't there a guaranteed Dragon spawn in a safe in the place with the huge satellite dish that go to for the Enclave quests?
---
Ok yes.  He approached me and said he had a TSE something...  asked me if I had anything to trade.  I indicated that he look in my vendor  which he did, then asked for the shotgun.   I took it out of my vendor and traded with him.  He said how do you want to do this?  I offered mine first for zero caps and he said thank you very much you've been scammed.  I'm a raider by the way.  He let me open his inventory again and he had nothing showing in the weapons tab, like zero weapons.  Anyway, that's about it.
---
Used to spawn all the time at the thunder mountain substation TM -02 but I think they patched that. I've seen a few by the National Radio Astronomy Research Center near where the Savage divide, cranberry, and the mire collide.
---
At least when Xbox (PS is questionable) you can see the immediate value with deals like Game Pass. I got to play The Outer Worlds for $1.00.
---
What Bethesda is doing affects whoever brought the game. You included. How? You're money and time is what let's them know it's ok to continue these insane and disrespectful practices.
---
Having a "it doesn't affect me" mindset is delusional. What's next? Loot boxes in TES VI? More settlement building DLC over quality DLC like Dawnguard and Far Harbor?
---
I got an Executioner's¬±15%FR+90RW I'm giving a try now. It chews through ammo and suffers from the spin-up bug more than my gatling plasma, otherwise it's pretty fun an effective.
---
Yeah when Bethesda first talked about camp building the way they described it was similar to this but ur camps have to be so far apart that u can't really do cool stuff like towns or anything I mean I've tried and made it work but it could be much better
---
been scrapping a lot of those and have not unlocked more.
---
Do you have a screenshot of the robot arms having more upgrades&gt;
---
In retrospect he would have had to open his sales window for me to see anything......of course he didn't right.
---
junkies adds +10% damage per addiction (up to +50%). cherry pick your addictions to reduce the harm.
---
Since I moved near Vault 76, I've noticed he's been a neighbor to the north (directly above the "76" on the map).  Maybe 5% of the time, I'd say.  It's kind of interesting because it doesn't seem like a random spawn point for anything else.  He's just *there* sometimes.
---
I can attest to never actually bumping into it around Flatwoods, though. üòÇ
---
That's against the rules of this Reddit...
---
The whole point is the private servers
---
no diseases very strange in my pip boy it says 171 damage I equip the gun and it drops to 103
---
okay thanks ill start checking there!
---
okay awesome thanks!
---
Yeah the base game is all u need fallout 1st makes the game to easy
---
And the dlcs are free so no need to worry
---
A group on PC mass duped them and gave thounsands away for free. They are now worth next to nothing.
---
Yes sorry, just edited post to include details.  I was flustered and a bit pissed off, i should have given details.
---
Never again
---
This isn‚Äôt that relevant to the post.
---
How about a hunters long coat and 5k caps?

This is so fucking sad Jesus christ

My showing the photo of him in it is against the rules?
---
Purified water was replaced by Cola in Futurocracy (2004) movie when water was no longer trusted in any other place to be clean other then in cola factories
---
The in mask too is rare I've never seen anyone with it though
---
yeah sure, i‚Äôm down
---
I got a legendary shishkebab that had Bloodied and 40% faster swing speed. I ran it with martial artist just to see how fast I could swing it and it was still absolute garbage. I pretty much only bring it out when I want to challenge myself. Since my Bloodied Deathclaw one shots all the time, it makes the game have a real change of pace when I have to hit something like 5 times.
---
No. But posting his/her username in here would be...
---
What if he got all 4 just using a bunch of different accounts or taking alot of time
---
Wanna know something cool some people have nothing else to do but grind for cool cosmetic items
---
Is it clean looking?
---
Ok good.  Thanks.
---
So you traded, or sold
---
K
---
I you use the chems you don‚Äôt get negatives of the withdrawal.
---
Yeah it looks cleaner
---
Sold but he just threw this in for free
---
I actually don't waste ammo since I'm a melee build but I agree.
---
Yeah it might be one of the very valuable nurse outfits
---
I don't think its worth anything tbh
---
1978? Was he a kid or was he 41? Either way that‚Äôs a bummer man. I never trade weapons with people who just turn up to my vendor.
---
"It's Grraaafton Daaay . . . again!"
---
Ok idk for sure though
---
Yeah idk
---
Explosive harpoon gun the absolute god weapon it can one shot 3 glowing mole miners with one shot.
---
He sounded like late teens or early 20's to me.
---
Does it have a colour on it? Yellow, brown, red or something like that?
---
very few people played survival mode, so they reused those servers for the new private worlds
---
Get rid of it if you have bloodied team mates.  Just use rad away.  Rad sponge drives me crazy when my team mate has it on.  I insta leave.  Theres nothing worse than suddenly losing my strength and carry weight in a queen fight or nuke zone because teammate forgot to shut that useless perk off.  Boo rad sponge.  But I'm a bloodied build.  It may also be that you have a disease that reduces your charisma and unshares your perk.
---
No I have the blue and green one though but this one is white and it's called nurse outfit not Asylum worker uniform idk though
---
What platform was it on, I‚Äôll keep an eye out for him. Thanks for the heads up üëç
---
PS4
---
Hmm, i'm not sure if they are much in value. Might want to do some research on that one then. I do think you can find them quite commonly though.
---

Your dog is adorable does it like to be pet.
---
Because even in WV there is some dude out there in the apocalypse still restocking Nuka cola vending machines
---
Let me know if you find a way injust can't  get over level 30 u.u
---
5k? Heeeeeeell yeah, brother. I‚Äôll DM you my GT.
---
Agreed. No way this is legit, and is obviously on PC.
---
Why didn't you say that first?
---
Things I want
---
1) Idk of this is already a thing but when u claim workshops in fallout 1st u get the option to rejoin that exact server so the workshop is already claimed and built upon by urself. If u don't want that then u can restart the world
---
2)When the wastelanders dlc comes out make a way where we can have 3 different types of servers one for people not done with main game, one for people starting the new part of the game, and a third one so we can have how it is now because what if u have a mule account u wouldn't be able to transfer ur stuff if ur a low level mule and ur friend who holds ur stuff is a high level.
---
3)PvP be alot easier to avoid I hate accidently shooting someone like and then they kill me even when I use heart emote
---
4) Camp items to have 2 versions of them an old rustic version and a new clean version (I hate having brick walls look both old on the outside and new with the wallpaper on the inside
---
5)have an option to not use ur teammates shared perk. Maybe one of u need rad sponge but the others build is hurt by it
---
I've got my camp in a powerline tower a little ways north of Top of the World and I've come back to camp 4 or 5 times and found it in there. I think there may be a spawn point nearby. I really expected he would be harder to kill than he was.
---
Ik not to use it with bloodied teammates (also none of the people I play with are bloodied builds) Im talking about me and my friends go to a nuke zone and they ask me to share rad sponge because they are stronger outside of power armor and don't want to have to worry about rads. And when I do it shows the perk being used and then automatically turned off. Does this with other perks too but not all of them.
---
Been blocked in the US for copyright it looks like?
---
Edit: is it possible to build this out in a Spotify playlist or something to be shared?
---
I used incisor, martial artist, and all melee damage perks. Add in Radicool, Nerd Rage, Serendipity, Ghoulish, Adamantium Skeleton, Fireproof, Supressor, Tenderizer, etc
---
&gt;I'm a little older too... but none have ever addicted me so much that I keep playing just cause I find something so awesome and completely unexpected
---
This is me too... I've been gaming since, pretty much, gaming was available on PC...Bards Tale with EGA graphics was the first really "cool" graphics game I played, before that it was adventure and other ASCII based shareware games. 
---
FO76 has held my interest for more than 1700 hours now and I couldn't really explain where all that time went!
---
No I think you got ripped off man
---
If it does return, I hope its like survival in fo4.
---
Well I sold the helm for 12.5k he just threw that in
---
how high is your charisma?  check your pip boy stats next time it shuts off
---
Thats interesting
---
When the new wastelanders DLC comes out I want to have npcs as the vendor. So I can build a proper shop and have people inside of it. This also makes my camp seem less lonely.
---
A system similar to Rusts "Camp Wardrobe" thing, where the build zone can only be built-on by other players who have permissions set in the "Wardrobe" and if you are not part of that permission then you can't build there.
---
And now I have a qe laser rifle
---
I already know my charisma it's my highest stat at 18
---
Well I bought it I had to sell something to get caps to buy the we laser rifle
---
Went through a lot of different audio tracks.
---
After I uploaded this... I realised yes I should of said It first. Solid note üëç
---
*qe
---
No problem. I had I believe 15 strength and full unyielding armor. You‚Äôll be able to do a lot of damage but you‚Äôll have to play conservatively due to the real low health
---
I just did this challenge with a good friend.  Was lucky enough to have him sign on, so we ran through a queen fight really quick then got our atom challenge.  It's possible, just really hard, and probably worth 20, not 10 atoms.
---
The only legendary gamma guns I got are 2 three star ghoul slayers gamma gun.
---
They always spawn there by watoga power station forget what it's called every once in a while they'll be legendary good place to get handmades
---
It's always been there, very easy to miss. I only saw it for the first time a few months ago
---
The question was "Has the hate against fallout 1st died down?" PS4 numbers don't mean shit when we're talking about the "conversation". You're just tossing out opinions like everyone else. You say the game is dead, and I say I go into server after server after server full of players. That's not a dead game. 
---
And I feel like most PC trades happen in discords anyway, so the "market" you see might not have the whole picture?
---
Since release.
---
I had this too North of Whitespring in the mountains. Snapped a pic of it while it was still alive!
---
You don't need bandolier at all. 44 revolvers are really efficient and 100 caps will get you 100 rounds. 
---
Qol should focus on staying alive and stealth, plus food and all those perks which boost your Dr and er without PA.
---
Id appreciate it, what is you`r Bethesda Launcher Username?
---
I hope they overhaul it if it ever returns. I'd like it to be similar to Rust/DayZ/Ark/etc. You start with nothing and you lose everything on death. Most importantly, there shouldn't be any legendary gear.
---
Ok, I see some people are jonesing about the lack of outrage recently...
---
I can‚Äôt do the PvP aspect and am tired of dying to someone who is cheesing or hacking the game. I like to farm for legendary weapons and give out them to the people who are just starting out. As for friends I have made more by doing the queen and encriptid, or by reading then I have the random people from NW.
---
I hope so. The PvPers need a home, too.
---
It's part of the game. He did not cheat, he just seduced you. Raiders gotta raid.
---
"I‚Äôll be using the perk card load out mod so I don‚Äôt have to use points to transfer perk points. "
---
Explain this please, are you saying you can change your stats without using perk points?
---
Y'all missing out by not teaming up with people.  Tales of espionage and intrigue, player made factions and wars between them, it's lit.
---
Do Westtek runs. Supermutants give some of the most XP in the game and Westtek is a really good location to find legendaries.
---
Add me if you need a crazy sidekick with a grenade launcher to make things go boom. Andreslamantis.
---
I think if you're wanting to focus on handling hords with the bffr fr I'd max out adrenaline and ap perks in luck to compensate for lower dmg of pistols.
---
The "nurse outfit" is also called an asylum clean white dress. Not worth much and u can't use ut for dailies but uts good to have
---
Ok thanks for the info
---
I have a bunch of hours in game and I don't think I've ever seen a Nurse's Outfit. Maybe hold onto it until you get someone that knows more about it.
---
Now they're gonna sell a nuka cola bottler on the atomic shop
---
Why do yall hate dupers so much? I hate hoarders, like they have all these amazing weapons they Don't even use.
---
&gt; I've nearly 5k Atom points
---
Slacker.
---
must be a glitch then.
---
Ok
---
lmao i was talking to my gf cause im helping her get all of the teddys and mr fuzzies and i was like i think shes Scottish
---
This happens to me sometimes. I've noticed that it seems to happen when your Charisma is very close to the minimum required to share a specific perk. Try raising your Charisma a bit with the Magnetic Personality Charisma perk.
---
now if you could do a vid on all the robot models
---
Yup, you download the mod and in the .ini you can put the link to a Nuke Dragon loadout thing and switch between builds with the click of a button, avoiding using perk points to change things around. Useful for just snagging a build you like real quick. But, you have to already have all the perks or it leaves open slots
---
It's probably a melee dude, can easily do 10s of thousands of dmg. Maybe you should stop complaining take charge and run silos yourself
---
&gt; And I will word it this way for it to make sense, there are players who are currently playing this game within the limitations of the early game because they are not subscribed to fallout 1st. That is wrong
---
I'm a player who is playing the game within the limits of "the early game" and it is not wrong at all.  It is the game I play.  I like it like that.
---
Are you confused?  This is about fallout 1st, not the Atomic shop.
---
This is why I insist on a high cap price on trades with randoms. I sell mine for 10,000, they sell theirs for 10,000. That way if all goes well we still have a flat trade, but if worse comes to worse I haven't lost too much.
---
You pay for private servers and nukes dont even work right?  Big Oof.  Sorry.
---
Speculating that someone cheated without any actual evidence?   I'm glad the player didn't have any identifying gamertag or profile posted.  I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt.  Nice display of those rare masks!
---
Dilluted needs a rework.
---
I have trust issues so this hasn‚Äôt happened to me yet. You need more trust issues in your life.
---
I will keep an eye out on PS4 :)
---
Private servers are better for nuking so people usually do it there
---
As far as I can see the largest number of people wanting the scrapbox to be free for all are people who have the sub.  Looks like they just want to play less money, or maybe they've got some kind of weird guilt thing going on.
---
(I don't have the sub, I don't want the scrapbox).
---
I have an Anti-Armor one on ps4 it has another perk to I think swing speed or something, it's in my stash as I use a rifle.
---
Oh I never thought of that, I will, just for u and ur girlfriend!! Thanks for the idea üòä also I hope this video helped a wee bit? I did one on all the other 13 teddy‚Äôs too if u need that üòä
---
Aaa , fresh noob energy.  The ambition to kill is strong with this one
---
Its worth it. Fallout 76 has its problems but at first the game is extremely fun imo
---
This is a much faster pace and alot more difficult in early game than any fallout game.
---
But it actually doesn‚Äôt affect me. I don‚Äôt subscribe to fallout 1st. If an update where to take away all my progress then yes, it would but that‚Äôs not the case. I don‚Äôt pay attention to the outside stuff that often to even negatively impact me. With fallout first, you have a choice to buy it for a month or a year and I chose not to partake in it. To me you make it sound like simply accepting and ignoring something is a disgrace because I internally know it‚Äôs wrong. Fallout 1st is one of those thing where you chose with your wallet and I chose not to and I took the hard way out by playing the game and pretending it doesn‚Äôt exist and enjoying what I bought. Their is nothing in a game that forces me to buy something. If a loot box is introduced and the game makes it so that it is a necessity to buy, then that‚Äôs a different story. Sure, scrap boxes are a competitive advantage if you look at it a certain way but I go buy just fine without them. 
---
And by saying that you get an immediate value with deals like the Xbox Game Pass, you can‚Äôt see the value of private worlds, more storage, less lag in private worlds and free daily NCR Ranger skins? 
---
Also, me spending no money with a lot of time spent playing the game doesn‚Äôt do jack for them. It just means that 60$ friggin dollars is enough to pay for a game.
---
and I answered that question. except you said I was wrong, and the reason you gave me was based on anecdotal evidence. which is completely fine, considering my original answer was based on anecdotal evidence as well.
---
at that point the conversation shifted, however. into which one of us is right. which neither of us can prove. except I have the original PS4 numbers to back my claim. so yes, they do matter. *now*.
---
the game is obviously not dead in the literal sense otherwise the servers probably wouldn't even be up anymore. it's certainly dead-er than it once was, factually, and imo Fo1st has had a negative impact in the playercount. but as we've established already, I can't prove that. it's just \*my\* perception. unlike the PS4 numbers which are also factual.
---
and I can't comment on the dirscord thing as I'm not into any major PS4 trading hub to draw a comparison.
---
So shove those points in endurance then? Okay.
---
I get alot of legendarys in a private server nuke. Reloading and forcing the respawn works amazingly
---
Most of the people on my friends list are nuke fanatics so I can have 5-12 nukes in one evening if I am lucky. I guess it depends on whom you hang out with.
---
Nothing
---
Okay I‚Äôll think about how to do this
---
I think your idea is game breaking a bit. I am pretty sure they don't want the camps to be too big. I do think it would be cool if you could have a team of 3 or so and when the first person logged in, the first camp loaded in that was shared with their team and so on. So it would be something like the white springs camp, then then one in the mire, then one in the cranberry bog. No matter who logs in the order is the same (or it could be an individual order that would go down the list of each person's priorities, but that's more complicated). I think that would be more reasonable and pretty cool to implement.
---
No New Ranger outfit? Really?
---
Maybe you and your bros should chill out on the perk stacking and duped gear.  I haven't seen anyone fail to kill the queen in 9 months.
---
No need to kill her in one hot. Let everyone get a few shots in before you kill her or launch your nuke on a private server if you can't wait a few extra minutes.
---
Thanks.
---
Why do we drink Cola? Because it‚Äôs got electrol‚Äînuclear material!
---
Cola: it‚Äôs what Mutfruit craves!
---
Brother, you should e been there last night.
---
I logged back onto my level 45 for the first time in nearly a year, and since my base is at W.S. I decided to do a quick run...right after a top level player had spawned (65??? Level beasties- seems like I saw that, but I was very much confused by it).
---
I do my run, and my bloodied build, along with a huge amount of stims, gets me to the tennis court outside - surrounded by ghouls - a lot of legendaries. 
---
I ceiling jump, fence walk, everything.   Toss grenades everywhere, and I‚Äôm getting traction when a glowing 3 star deathclaw comes out of nowhere and starts eAting everything. 
---
Took me 45 minutes to get him, and only after dragging him to a yoi GUI / robot fight (he still beat them all) and Then finally chipped him down when he bugged on a fence. 
---
Many legendaries, a bit of fun, and adrenaline.  Can recommend white springs if your really looking, but it‚Äôs not easy.
---
* think he spawned between the fountain and ws entrance north of it.
---
Well it would still work within the border limit between camps but the camp size would work into that limit so that it could be bigger
---
There was the original one and the green skin from a few weeks back. Nothing came up since the 23rd, which was the one month subscription roll over date. It‚Äôs disappointing.
---
LOL
---
I want giant sloth PA paint Scheme.
---
Also not a lot of time
---
Damn I need to fast travel less then... Haha
---
thats not a lot of time?! lol
---
Its like they dont want me to renew it...
---
I like this idea.  I also like the idea of taking it a step further and using the camp in a game mode such as capture the flag, harpoint, raids etc.  Have you ever played Stronghold Crusader? Imagine that but in the Fallout76 world.
---
Been playing sense realese about 5 hours a night and about 2 15 hour session on off days
---
LoL 100% duped. Those were going around even before the event started. People are dropping bags full of them everywhere unfortunately...still, dupers decided to keep the Jester mask less duped. Wonder why...probably to illegaly mass sell them for currency...
---
Seems like it works well for some.
---
Yeah guess I rambled too much and didn't really explain anything lol just following his lead and just 1 example of stuff that happens almost every time I play.
---
And I forgot to even mention fallout 3, new Vegas and fo4 I was addicted to them tooüòÇ so I knew what I was getting here on day of release even with all the shit talking from beta just no way I wasn't going to like it ya know??
---
I bought mine from some super-trader that had everything from dev room items to legacy weapons. Definitely been duped into oblivion.
---
i remember it being more than 10 percent. maybe im wrong though
---
where the hell is the death claw at white springs?!
---
at the time of that event, there was maybe 1 confirmed drop of 1 of the masks across all platforms.  iirc there was another few that were super ultra rare with 0 confirmed drops though my recollection is hazy.  
---
Then, suddenly, months after the event, this ultra rare mask is available at scale.
---
&gt; the drop rates were bugged to not drop at all and Bethesda didn‚Äôt fix it
---
Truth is, the game was rigged from the start.  They were intentionally given insanely low drop rates, which can still be verified in the game files. 
---
The Jester, Skull, and Winter Man masks are the "Uncommon" ones, with a ***1 in 50,000*** chance.
---
The Goblin and Sun masks are the "Rare" ones, with a ***1 in 100,000*** chance.
---
Yes, the sun mask exists, but apparently it just wasn't mass-duped like the others.
---
[Here](https://nukacrypt.com/database/json/003E6557) is the raw data, for anyone who wants to see for themselves.
---
true true. well over 1000 then?
---
At least 1100 I think
---
nice!
---
:)
---
I wonder
---
It‚Äôs really ‚Äòthief gotta lie‚Äô
---
The Nurse Uniform could be a dev room item. I know what you're saying, but so far I've never seen it on game spawning naturally.
---
Ever since they made Scorchbeasts legendary-able, those are great. Normally 1 star, but sometimes 3, and pretty common at fissure sites. Plus a decent hit of exp when you take them and their scorched friends out. Probably not good for lower levels, though. Too expensive bullet wise if you're not hitting'em pretty hard. 
---
Lower level, the Golf Course is still pretty decent, even after nerfs. There's the little ledge outside the window by the side door. They think they can path to you there, so they keep coming at you, but can't get through the window unless they clip. Agro them, toss a grenade. 600+ exp booom!
---
Pay to not play (a part of) the game.
---
try clicking the picture?
---
That's a matter of perspective;)
---
Same that would be cool to have a Dev room item
---
I hear ya. There's so many cool unmarked locations that are incredibly easy to miss with the convenience of fast travel lol
---
Just do it.  Don‚Äôt listen to al the bad press.  Use your own brain to determine if you like what it is or not.  I find it quite enjoyable. Nothing is perfect, why would I expect a game to be. Best of luck to you!
---
&gt; I feel the same about the fridge
---
&gt; The repair kits were done via atom shop or earned in game
---
The fridge can be earned in game.
---
(it's also useless, total waste of me free atoms).
---
I got it on one of the golf carts at the Whitesprings once next to a Mr Jangles
---
What are the chances that people pulled multiple old man winter masks, but 0 of any of the others. These weren‚Äôt insanely low, they were bugged. If you think that out of the thousands of times the event was done, nobody was able to get any of the masks. Then about two months ago, someone magically has one and let‚Äôs say my ‚Äúconnections‚Äù have told me they‚Äôre hacked in. Not to mention, if these masks are legitimate, where is the sun mask? That would have to exist on at least one platform. While the drop rates are supposed to be insanely low, that‚Äôs not why nobody got them.
---
I see--and launch--nukes very often. Several a day usually.
---
No.  I just did and it‚Äôs worse, not better than before.
---
I just undressed in front of a stranger after the queen fight...thankfully he returned the favor ;)
---
Always been there. Nice place to put your camp.
---
Yh like evasive and barbarian
---
Ok bud, the game is dead. Enjoy not playing it. üôÑ
---
I'll be over here enjoying myself, making new friends regularly and going for vendor camp to vendor camp full of people and loot.
---
So just go in and clear the golf course? And what do I do when I clear them all? 
---
I‚Äôm kind of new to endgame, and haven‚Äôt played in almost a year, sorry if I‚Äôm asking some noob questions.
---
Just my own personal musing as a level 172 pistol user:
---
First, and something I always ask when I see it:  Why are you taking class freak?  With a backpack and taking proper mutations for ranged you lose Str end and some int, but you don‚Äôt need to carry everything under the sun esp with an unyielding build.  Just my view it‚Äôs not a gamebreaker by any means.
---
Str I only did 1 for pharmacy.  Ammo isn‚Äôt that heavy.  Debating going back to 3 for blocker 3.
---
Charisma I took 9.  lone wanderer of course, suppressor at 3 and tenderizer at 1 for things that don‚Äôt die in one shot, and, yup, travel agent Bc I am cheap.
---
End fireproof and rejuvenated for me tho I‚Äôm debating moving those two points back to Str from rejuvenated.
---
Agi escape artist, 3 covert op, 3 in gun fu, 1 pt each gunslinger perk.  30% more damage for 6 pts?  Seems a tough trade to me.  I know this makes you more of a vats build but gun fu is so good as is adrenaline so you‚Äôre out 8 pts right off the bat.  High agi makes stealth better so unyielding + base and you should be fine.  I rarely run into problems. 
---
Luck outside of starched genes and serendipity being musts have some room to play with.  I run 1 better crits (my pistol has better crits and I hear it doesn‚Äôt stack fully) 3 crit savvy 3 grim reaper sprint, and bloody mess tho I shuffle those on occasion with psychopath and clover.
---
Perception and Int same as I have, tho I tend to have chemist and scrapper up and forget about them quite often!
---
Lastly get yourself a cowboy hat, you don‚Äôt want to look ridiculous using pistols without the hat!
---
That‚Äôs not a bait and switch, that would be if he traded a different less valuable weapon. This was simply a theft.
---
Where is Westtek? I‚Äôm kind of a noob and have forgotten a lot
---
This is an interesting idea and I've thought about it as well. The problem I see though, is you're not always teamed with your family/friends. So then, maybe you can set it to your PlayStation friends. But you don't want all your friends to have access to your "combined" CAMP, how could this problem be resolved? The same way to can do it to restrict people from entering your private world when your on?
---
It be interesting to see how this could be implemented... You know, AFTER they fix all the other problems or implementing the other things they said they were going to add üòè
---
 O, he‚Äôs saying he can instantly swap perks around without having to do manually, but he needs to own the cards and have perk points assigned.
---
There is a set near Silva homestead and lewis and sons farm supply
---
[I made this list a while ago. Hope it helps you.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/User_blog:%D7%93%D6%B8%D6%BC%D7%A0%D6%B4%D7%99%D6%B5%D6%BC%D7%90%D7%9C/Farming_in_Fallout_76!)
---
I played with someone for a while who got a nocturnal 3* Dragon that did something like 2k damage with a sneak attack at night. He one-shot a level 60 sheepsquatch. Shame they don't drop anymore.
---
Neither is great, but it depends on the weapon.  I probably would use any weapon with either prefix unless I had absolutely nothing better.
---
&gt; So if a player wants to ~~fully experience~~ *[ avoid ]* the game mechanics of the game they fully paid for, subscription is the only way
---
its been the only game i've wanted to play the last week because I have tooth ache and not many games can be played in such a way that you can just randomly stop (pain) but also not many games can be as distracting when you're focused on a specific task like finding certain resources or doing quests. or stopping scorchbeasts from destroying your base again because you built it too close to a fissure.
---
I play a lot of other games, i'm currently raid logging classic wow, I have an SC pledge for a avenger titan and i've not played much of 3.7, I play escape from tarkov with my bro and I play a lot of even indy games like ksp and factorio so, I have so many games i'm spoilt for choice, 76 to me is easy to leave gather dust mainly because i don't have friends actively playing it, but I still enjoy playing it by myself and just being a casual completionist, finding all the recipes for armors and weapons and mods, i think the game works best if you just set yourself some goals and then when those are done, set new ones. or just randomly explore hop around events. there is a lot of game to walk around and just explore if thats what you like doing. for me that was always the best part of fallout games, the finding of new and interesting locations. 76 does this quite well and has maybe 30-40 hours of poi hunting alone perhaps more if you're not actively trying to visit everywhere.
---
You forgot Anti Armor
---
Oh, and practically every CAMP I visit has a 1st Scrapbox, too.
---
I'd say Scorchbeast farming is only good if you're running full bloodied, you can kill them while they're spawning. They're really tanky against other builds.
---
Thanks, that looks really useful!
---
It‚Äôs .75 damage per shot.
---
There's some misunderstanding here. Perk Loadout Manager lets you quickly switch cards, but your SPECIAL stats stay the same. So if your build has a Perception of 3 you won't be able to max Commando cards.
---
oops, thanks bub
---
I‚Äôm level 63 now, I think? I know I just kinda quested for most of my exp. I‚Äôm trying to reset my perk points right now though, so I‚Äôm kinda struggling
---
It was built to celebrate the 3 centuries America had been around according to fallout lore. The specific vault has existed in the fallout lore since fallout 3 though.
---
I'm unsure what you mean "what do I do when I clear them all". Sell what you don't need, scrap weapons/armor/junk for scrap?
---
Blue suitcases at train stations. Load em up.
---
leave the private world, wait a few seconds, re-enter private world
---
Is it really as bad as people say it is? Not even close. It's a great game imho. I've put more hours into 76 than fallout 4.
---
Also Instigating, but you got most of them.  Instigating is potentially the 2nd best prefix in the game behind Bloodied, depending on the weapon and situation.
---
Ya, I've got you... Ihad played all the fallouts,  from 1-4 and everything in between and wasteland before that, overall my favorite franchise.  I was a bit uncertain on FO76, not because of the reviews or the shit talking, but because it was an online multiplayer game, something I just didn't do! But I played attention to actually playing it and ended up getting it with a week or two to go in the beta. Haven't looked back or played anything else, since then.i played my first 50+ levels solo and then discovered the whole new world, (for me!) Of playing teamed up...it changed everything for me
---
I was playing on a private server last night and got 3 legendary scorchbeasts and a handful of legendary enemies mostly 2-3*. My only bitch is a couple of them hit the ground and disappeared, sadly I've gotten kind of used to it.
---
Yeah, that's why I said higher levels are probably more likely to do SBs. There are non-bloody builds that can take SBs, but it is a lot easier with Bloody. I can 3 shot a regular level 65 SB, easy. 5-6 shots for a legendary, 2903784293084 for a level 80 3\* haha.
---
It‚Äôs annoying having to switch from my fast travel perks after rushing to an sbq fight , we need perk loadoits so we don‚Äôt have to swap while getting bombarded by the queens adds
---
Like a better boost than what it has. Or maybe just scrap it from the game altogether. No one really uses or wants it anyway.
---
That also would be nice
---
I was hoping for this before release. I want to be camp mom and medic!
---
I'd enjoy it better, actually. I play Fo76 in spite of it being multiplayer, not because of it. but like I said, that's just my take on it. so enjoy it being alive, I guess?
---
&gt;Oh, and practically every CAMP I visit has a 1st Scrapbox, too.
---
you wouldn't be seeing camps that belong to players who quit, now would you? with a scrap box on top of it if they left because of Fo1st.
---
that's an indication of nothing, really.
---
It's East of The Whitespring. The building is visible on the map. Shouldn't be hard to notice.
---
I‚Äôve been having the same problem and it seems to only go away if I have sufficient charisma before buffs. I had 4 and upped it to 6. Now I can share a level two card and not have it turn off. With armor, perks, etc my charisma is much higher but that seems to not work correctly.
---
no on the E
---
I was just thinking about this the other day during that daily. So weird we can't boil water at the brewer... Unless of course you consider in that it might contaminate the alcohol. But they could always add in an extra bunsen burner and beaker for effect.
---
Just save points after leveling up. The choose greet is annoying when you are at the perk choosing screen but I have saved points in case something new comes up with Wastelanders (new Perks and such).
---
Something so small would have such a huge impact on playability
---
They fixed it months ago. Reading patch notes is important.
---
Yeah ,but going from melee to ranged and vice versa is a pain
---
It‚Äôs why you bank levels. I‚Äôve had to completely change my build 3 times at level 250 something.
---
One would think the "Tricentennial Edition" would have given that away. 
---
And of course as mentioned, Vault 76 is referenced in a recovered Vault Tec file that the BoS had in their possession.
---
Yup, nada, really disappointed.
---
The Charleston building change happened without my notice, and someone mentioned it the other day so I checked it out and got my butt handed to me as I was not prepared lol
---
I'll have to check that event out then
---
Golf Course is great for lower levels, as you can stand on the ledge by the side door and they can't get to you.
---
TL:DR patch notes
---
Probably not considering modus killed them all
---
Not really. It would make the game more versatile, allowing you to experiment with different builds more.
---
I joined a player clearing the north westernish powerplant, went inside to find high level super mutants. I went back out side, and discovered there was an ARMY of super mutants marching on the workshop. We must of killed 30-40 super mutants. They all used sharpshooter assault rifles, so I got a fair amount of caps for selling them. I've never seen so many mutants in one spot
---
I think that was a woman on PS4 - the only legit drop that I saw of the sun mask.
---
Should I have to do that after logging in for first time for the day?
---
Some other post says to play normal lobby for 5 mins then switch to private lobby
---
I could see needing to reset the world after you have farmed everything.  
---
What I‚Äôm saying is.  I never see legendary spawns ever.  
---
Also.  I‚Äôm not getting uranium fever event.  Was trying to test on that. And it always says it‚Äôs on cool down
---
Same here , lvl 370 atm. I like to switch back and forth, i get boored
---
According to lore caps are backed by water.  But since Bethesda retconned everything it doesn't matter now
---
How does mob respawn work in this game, is what I was trying to ask. Sorry!
---
Thanks!
---
Personally, I really like the system in place. It incentivizes players to think carefully about their builds while allowing some changes if you mess up.
---
Yeah on da box friend and I were making a white springs run and his toon in battle got glitched under one of the cottages and was able to see inside two of them and one had a household decor and a enclave officer standing in it
---
whoa that's a lot heavier than I thought sorry.  I always log out\in when I first start.  wish I could be more help.  hope you get it sorted.
---
What this post said
---
A f-ing men...I don‚Äôt know how many times I‚Äôve gone to fights with weapon artisan and fix it good equipped, green thumb and Woodchucker
---
If you are a noob, I‚Äôd probably not go to west tek
---
Nah, my build got nerfed and then I switched twice cause my second build was bad.
---
A lot of the planned stuff was probably related to Wastelanders and the new factions. With it delayed they find themselves lacking.
---
I noticed this a while before FO 1st
---
I run carnivore and have more meat than I need. Animals are everywhere. Ragstags attack my camp often so i shoot them, cook them up, and go off adventuring. Usually in the course of play I‚Äôll end up with a bunch more meat. If not, meat is super easy to find. And yes I have plenty to share with anyone I‚Äôm playing with as we all run carnivore.
---
The Urban armor came out in early November, just a few weeks ago which makes it the second armor to come out since Fallout 1st was launched only 5 weeks ago.  I would assume the third one will make an appearance here in December?  Again, Fallout 1st is only 5 weeks old, not three months old.
---
Auto or Semi Auto guns? Special allocation?
---
Nurse outfit spawns in a random building in Charleston. I want to say it's a pharmacy?
---
Oh, I gotcha. Well it's weird, and you might have to server hop sometimes. But generally you can do say, golf course, then hit wes-tec, then Harper's Ferry, etc. Do like a loop. By the time you get done with your loop, you can start over. 
---
I personally don't have a loop I stick to, and just enjoy going to whatever spot I feel like and wandering around. Normally a SBQ happens, I go over there, or a Violent Night (which is my favorite, and if you just repair the jukebox you can get waves of mobs for 25 minutes with 4-5 legendaries. Just make sure you start the jukebox actually playing music around the 15 minute mark so you can complete the event. Keep an eye on the bar and you'll get used to when you need to make music timed just right.) Or a Lode Bearing, Free Range or whatever public event pops that I feel like doing. 
---
Also always check your daily and weekly challenges for free Atoms.
---
That's a specific mutation and you are kinda farming enemies with that, and besides I meant new players, they don't have access to carnivore. Clean pre-war food and purified water are not in so much abundance, only enough for players to pick up and make it to the next destination
---
Aha, a player earlier today managed to trigger a second round of super mutants as I just finished cleaning out West Tek. So I know your pain brother. I went from 17000 caps to about 23 on the plus side!
---
I'd say bloodied ffr, but it depends from weapon to weapon what your damage output would be.
---
Have a pic or video?
---
Try r/Market76
---
get 4 unyielding armour 1 life savings.  oh and talons etc mutations
---
Fallout used to be about the Finality and Consequence of ones Choices... Used To be..
---
If you're on ps4 and can wait a couple of hours I'll make you a set for free
---
I've been saying this from day 1 that there needs to be a full respec option that costs caps or something. It needs to be large, perhaps like 10K caps to dissuade people from doing it all the time. To have no full respec option in a RPG like this is beyond belief and amazingly dumb. But every time I bring up this idea, you always get those hardcore players come out and fight you on it saying that it "breaks the game" or "devalues your choices" or some such nonsense. Most of those people are idiots because literally every game but Fallout has a respec system and it has no negative effect on the game. In fact a full respec system will only make a game a better experience for the player because it gives you the freedom to experiment with different builds without having to restart your entire character or wait 100 levels to redistribute a stat point. A better fallout system would be to allow players to reach enough levels to collect every card, then every level after that can be put into a bonus system like "Badass Ranks" in Borderlands which allow you to customize and min max your character even more.
---
I‚Äôm not a streamer nor am I that into the game. So nope.  Just letting people know.
---
The loadouts are coming, beginning of next year, or so they said....
---
I don‚Äôt play a ton and when I do I usually do I don‚Äôt do much. Used to have a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù who would always play and he had friends too but I guess he dropped me when I started playing games. Long story short, you can add me Mjdemon27. I‚Äôm a simple gamer with no builds at all and I don‚Äôt even have a backpack.
---
I never play the instruments, just start and stop the jukebox to farm legendaries. Lately the one-shotting idiots seem to be all over it every time I go though.
---
If the game freezes, you should be able to shut it down from task manager, just remember to set your task manager to always on top
---
Think positive! Perhaps new enclave chapters will arrive in Appalachia.
---
Also make sure you swap your perks to help you deal and take damage
---
There are three spots where it spawns at the Charleston station area. 
---
One, next to the shack. If a player's camp is there, look between the red railroad bridge and the station or under it.
---
Two, halfway up the hill close to the petrified corpse.
---
Three, cross the top railroad bridge over the gorge. It can spawn under the bridge then disappear and reappear on the opposite side under it across from the ship. It will walk up to the bridge. Be sure to kill the spawn that show up in the grassy area next to the bridge because they will shoot the vendor.
---
QE = (Quad Exsplosive) FFr = (Faster Fire Rate) RW = (90% Reduced Weight)
---
I always seem to get them from sons of Dane event. Seems like I always walk out of there with two or three but that‚Äôs not often enough to farm Really. Now that I think about it I‚Äôm not sure where I pick those up besides violent night
---
Oh wow, I have the exact same weapon! Its ok, But it does break very quickly.
---
This has happened to my camp too. I've deleted a few things and still no budget freed up.
---
Preach.
---
VATS Light machinegun build. Super hard to pull off. You need 5 pieces of unyieleing armor that has extra +agi for more action points, bloodied lmg with 25% reduced vats cost. Same build as commando but you go strength instead of perception. Deadly accurate, 2k + headshots. You also never go in danger becouse lmg isnt so loud. This build outdamages handmades/fixers on sbq by a mile. Only meathook does more damage.
---
With the woopsies.
---
18.  Do you mean 15?
---
Why exactly? Modus has kinda gone rogue, allowing mutated people to join the Enclave goes against what they stand for. Modus is only in it to restore his memory. There might be new content with Modus allowing us into the executive suite, however no enclave NPCs would come.
---
Cool, thanks! Anything helps, so cheers!
---
Mutations and stuff add onto it
---
I try to share my class freak perk because I got my friend his first mutation, marsupial, and his intelligence is minus 4 I share class freak it stays shared for like 5 seconds then it disappears and says it's not shared so I just share strange in numbers instead.
---
Yeah, that is weird.. I bought a year sub because of all the other stuff, still haven't even put on the outfit.
---
Scavenger build. No using workbenches or vendors.
---
It's the skull mask or something similar.
---
Here's the record for the Presidential T-60 suit, it has been in the game since the release, pretty sure there are also textures for it, will post them after I'll find 'em:
---
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/377423829187690499/650450464143441971/unknown.png
---
Trying to find the textures for the SS PA right now for you.
---
A legendary every minute and a half sounds like bullshit, but ok man
---
Thank you kind person!
---
Radshield
---
Was she on the ground?
---
I was in a group the other day where everyone seem to have them and it was around a 5 minute fight
---
Probably a ghoul just looping his last conscious activity.
---
Had this happen recently,  but when I logged back in the next time, I found that I had a bit of wiggle room in the budget again.  Not a lot, but enough for me to finish the changes I had to abandon due to the problem.
---
booo rad sponge! :)
---
The downside is until level 32 you don't gave access to perm mutations, and mutations don't last more than a couple radaway
---
In a different light.....ur not getting water forvquests, ur getting caps! Stay filthy!!
---
Ive tried that a few times, nothing seems to be making a difference
---
The Harper's Ferry vendor bot sells them sometimes, it's where I got mine before I found my Instigating one.
---
We‚Äôre you able to fix it? I‚Äôve  been trying everything I can think of.
---
It's the splash damage, I have a be gating plasma and it's useless if you fire it at her, but aim at the floor and it's lethal.
---
I also used to use a bloodied 50 cal and get similar damage. I now use a bloodied auto handmade and hit for nearly 400 damage per shot. Did a queen solo in about 6 mins with it.
---
Did any extended play yesterday on private world  so buds and I could goof on workshops, legendary mobs seemed to stop spawning around 3 hrs. First time it has ever happened, but we are also normally on public servers launching nukes. If we are on private it is just to cap scrips on horde events and such then hop out or do some challenges so prob not on more than an hour.
---
Although I love Uranium Fever for the amount of steel you can scrap &amp; the three guaranteed legendaries. They are rarely over lvl 40. Whereas One Violent Night you can really rake in on chems, caps &amp; other loot. Also is the chance for not just the Nightstalker legendary but we've killed as many as 3 or 4 legendary ghouls as well. All in all probably the best event in the game in terms of overall reward (not including Scorched Earth)
---
30k on 1 character
---
30000
---
Found mine in Charleston as well, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs rare.
---
I think it would be neat to be able to just keep what you build in a workshop on a private server. Could potentially function as a shared camp &amp; would honestly make workshop building more enjoyable in my opinion.
---
Honestly I would just want no legendaries, things would be so much more tense and fair
---
Hahaha I love that üòÇüòÇ
---
Yes they are everywhere.  I‚Äôve stopped going to this event altogether for that reason unfortunately.
---
Ok buddy. I'm gonna be posting a video of the method and put it on this sub later.
---
It's a method using private servers.
---
IIRC, that key is in a backpack in one of the cars of the Widow Maker roller coaster in Camden Park.
---
Raising the cap limit does absolutely nothing it‚Äôs called inflation. We just something to spend caps on right now you can‚Äôt really buy anything with caps in game. The easiest solution is caps for scrip.
---
It‚Äôs a great way to farm legendaries, XP and Chems.  
---
As always there are players who don‚Äôt like to share and one shot enemies, or try to force the event to finish quickly rather than taking close to the full 30 minutes.  But if you can avoid the selfish players I believe it is the best event in the game, and is such a great way for lower leveled players to level up if they just tag half an hour of ghoul waves.
---
Most of the time you can get well over six legendaries, if people don‚Äôt keep jumping on instruments or turn the Jukebox on too much.
---
You could possibly just give permission to players you trust, the camp would add like how a group chat acts... you can make it, add people to it and give them hierarchy so they could build.
---
Look at my post I literally posted this like a week ago
---
You stole my idea (look at my posts)
---
I agree with 100% of what you said. But... and this is a big stinky but(t)... Bethesda seems to have developed a habit of taking one step forward and three steps back.
---
Patch some bugs, good. Introduce game mode that no one asked for and only created new bugs and reintroduce old bugs.
---
Add new content that addresses fundamental issues with the game, but puts them behind a subscription fee after we've already payed for the game.
---
So I have one question: what makes FO76 still worth playing in your opinion?
---
Was thinking it could work like a group chat does. You create the group, add people to it and give them permissions
---
Probably not - survival was full off dip shits and Bethseda thought we don't need these losers so they can FO.
---
I‚Äôm sure many people have had the idea, i simply was thinking about it in the shower
---
I keep my tin foil hat just for challenges, lol
---
Because its out of circulation they use bottle caps now lol
---
I like it. I take it you include a larger shared budget as well?
---
Don‚Äôt have the plan :/
---
Three of those I've never even seen before.
---
(Man the second people make posts it's like BLAP instant comment üòØ) I mean you sell the pre-war money to vendor bots to get caps off them like selling junk, you can sell beer bottles and make alotta caps doing so
---
Yes, maybe the budget is worth four camps, budgets have been an annoyance to me as i have a 1st floor house with a backwoods bungalow sat on top. So my budget is almost maxed out due to the bungalow.
---
Meanwhile PC has a mod for that üòÇ
---
So rare that it's used to make glue.
---
I hope so, but not until they fix all the shit they did to pvp. Every patch just made things worse, they need to get some people who know what theyre doing when it comes to making a pvp game.
---
An autocorrect mistake.
---
No, that's the WEST end key. The East key used to be in a lunchbox on the bridge.
---
There‚Äôs a dude of yt called captainoob and he‚Äôs used a BE 50 and BE gat plasma against the queen. I‚Äôd suggest watching them to get a proper insight on the guns etc.....
---
PC is such a mixed bag though. NW cheating very bad, PvP cheating very bad , then there is the duping, good and bad depending on your outlook, though I wouldn't mind having some of the Fascnacht masks, and other things they have plundered.
---
Scrap it to cloth?  Bulk and sell
---
Bethesda must know about this bug, they would be daft to start banning people because of this, can you imagine the backlash.
---
I know it is kind of hard but when they disappear they go back to where they spawned i killed a 2star sb and it disappeared and i looked for about ten mins and found it  at my last fissure site.. but it works I‚Äôve done it a couple of times
---
There are a couple of things you can‚Äôt sell unfortunately. Looks completely random to me.
---
Okay, extracted the Secret Service PA textures here for you:
---
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/377423829187690499/650466348543115297/unknown.png
---
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/377423829187690499/650466428809379850/unknown.png
---
That would result in everyone having all God tier gear
---
Yep very well known bug hopefully it gets patched soon... Got the Mr fuzzy ride today for the sale they did and I'm terrified to make adjustments to camp and the Christmas stuff is coming soon!... I really want to get more camp stuff but I already have lost permanent budget and have phantom budget.. I would REALLLY hate to get this bug
---
I‚Äôd go with 10mm silenced full auto. Really depends on what you‚Äôre looking for or have in legendaries. My problem is every character I build ends up sneaking everywhere, that‚Äôs why my guerilla gunslinger runs a 10mm.
---
I've found a couple of these. Not valuable as a rare item even though they don't appear that often. Look exactly like the clean white asylum uniform. I've held on to mine as a just in case they someday become a desired thing.
---
I played on my private server for 3 hours Wednesday. No legendary.  I played for 2 hours Thursday 1 1 Star legendary .  I played for 3 hours today 1 1 Star legendary 
---
I can‚Äôt play for 6-8 hours a day.   I can only play for 1-2 hours.  All I can say is so far RNG has been awful for me on my private servers
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
I did the mire #3 x16 got T-51 RA
---
Mire #1 x10 got T-60 LA
---
I feel like maps are worth it now for PA plans only.
---
Harpoon minigun please
---
https://discord.gg/bDge823
---
Scrap it.  Bulk it. Sell it.
---
I would love this idea. In fact, when we first were planning out our group dynamic when Fo76 details were just coming out, my friends and I kinda thought this was how we could do things. 
---
Two of us wanted to make our camps pretty while the rest went out hunting for scrap for us.
---
Obviously you didn't read the post thoroughly
---
Don't call me buddy, pal
---
What do the east and west bridge keys unlock? I know I have the west one, don't think I have an east one
---
I agree, the beer bottle thing feels like recycling payment you know, clean up Appalachia's garbage and get rewarded
---
If youre having troubles with too much prewar money, stop picking it up.  Bethesda isnt going to allow it to be sold anytime soon.
---
For sure not a dev room item. 
---
Random spawn at the laundry in Charleston across Hornwright HQ
---
True. Really only a problem if playing solo. I‚Äôm almost always teamed up or I can load my GF in it she‚Äôs not playing to share starched genes while I take a quick shower.
---
I do too, I've done 3 drastically different builds on my 225, I get bored using the same weapon over and over
---
Wow someone attempts to help and u give them shit, no wonder ur not getting much help plus not to be a dick but there are plenty of places online to find that info, like utube, wiki just do a search its like magic
---
I'm cashing in aid drops and I keep collecting it. It should be able to be sold you can't tell me what I can and can't pick up it's not your loot, it's my loot and I can question the loot I pick up when I'd like it's reddit 76
---
Absolutely this, I remember seeing a ski lanes skin for the caged armor, I really want to buy this when Wastelanders adds back the caged armor.
---
You're absolutely right. My bad.
---
Two words.  Nuke. Zone.
---
When you‚Äôre at whitesprings, kill all the sentry bots too, those are worth 600-900xp each depending on your int and coming bonuses. During double xp weekend I leveled up an alternative character from 20 to 80 over those 3 days (with the help of a higher lv friend carrying me of course). Don‚Äôt bother killing the Low level robots though, they don‚Äôt award any xp at all
---
Search this subreddit for bloodied melee. Hope you're doing this to solo the queen on a private session and not to fuck with people.
---
I want to shop that super- store.
---
My dude has a clip of a queen he joined on, looks like mostly sneak commando builds, she‚Äôs dead in 30 seconds! No joke he was so mind blown he clipped it and as she spawned, landed, and then died it was a total of the 30 second clip! That‚Äôs just so insane to me.
---
Make gunpowder, make bullets sell both
---
Maybe what they ought to do is give your CAMP the ability to heal itself after some passage of time.
---
I mean, it's not like the bars are conveying actionable information.  I can't walk up to the damaged asset and repair it.
---
Unfortunately being sold for real money by a normal duper too.
---
Honestly I‚Äôm fine taking the water, radaway and stimpaks.  I can sell them or leave a Shanksgiving basket for a destitute, homeless Blue in Flatwoods.  Worst case scenario, I drink some water when my thirst is at 90% already.
---
Having to dump a handful of missiles, .44 ammo and a mini nuke after every event is something I can live without.  The atomics possum badge was the first and only time I ever used a fat man in 76.  It was a two shot version with a MIRV, and I still thought it sucked.
---
The Meat Hook is an aberration for both 1-handed and unarmed, so I don't really count it as being one or the others.
---
This sounds stupid, but the only way that ever worked for me was to unequip (not drop) all your gear, weapons included, then blow yourself up with grenades.
---
I shit you not, this is the only way that worked. I even tried reinstalling and it didn't help.
---
Yeahp.

I can do that but I have nothing of interest to sell, low level life I guess, I want to sell the PW Money like I did in fallout 4 to make caps, I don't care if it only 1 cap a piece regardless of perks and special I'll get cloth when I need cloth
---
So?  Make it very expensive in crafting resources. Each mod destroys the weapon and you get only one from each weapon.  To turn it into a mod require a slot specific item that costs perhaps 500 scrip.  Only the purveyor can add your mod to a weapon at perhaps 5k caps per affix.  It still keeps people playing, also becomes a cap sink that is desperately needed.
---
Won't happen anytime soon it seems, they had only 4 major fixes listed on the last community detail.
---
I'm doing it to help my wife and buddy run the queen more. I have a bloody melee but I want it to reach its full power.
---
Yeah but you definitely don't need to one or two shot the queen to do so.
---
They should just turn off CAMP destruction entirely. It‚Äôs little more than a nuisance, PvP CAMP destruction isn‚Äôt really a thing and I‚Äôd imagine it would be an easier load on the servers. They wouldn‚Äôt need to carry animations for destruction or the secondary destroyed state. That seems like a waste of resources for something nobody enjoys anyway.
---
The doors at either end of the bridge.
---
Man, think of all the free stash space you‚Äôll have if  you dump them.  3000 diluted stims is 750w.
---
If your Stimpacks don't register, it may be the case that you are taking rads that aren't either.  I've had that happen before.
---
The new skin should be on Dec 3rd since the last skin will expire on the 3rd.
---
Exactly. The information it conveys is absolutely useless. The only item I have in my camp that I want to know is about to break is my decontamination shower, because it‚Äôs expensive to repair.
---
no I had no mutations and no rads full health
---
Look for short places with crowned enemies like Toxic Larry's.
---
Yeah, at 32K damage, you're just screwing over other players at that point.
---
I mean, my alt hits for like 4,000 and I've gotten into the habit of breaking off toward the end because other players need to get their hits in too.
---
I want to
---
Excellent point, though I don‚Äôt mind spending the resources to repair everything to 100% if it means that I don‚Äôt have to look at 30 or so different condition bars in my camp.
---
If I could make twice diluted radaway, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôd use.  I have to be at a sliver of health to stay bloody after eating a diluted radaway.  Brahmin milks spoils too fast.
---
Bulk cloth even at a cost of two plastic can make a lot of money with hard bargain 3. 
---
Cloth as a commodity is somewhat popular due to its usage in gunpowder crafting. Anything related to bullets can sell. Cloth usually sells in large quantities at a time since its value is sub-cap except for the most motivated buyers.
---
I clearly stated in my question that I already have the West end key from the rollercoaster, and yet that was what his reply said to go get, meaning he didn't read my question. 
---
As far as searching for the info online, the Fallout 76 wiki is no longer accurate. It points to a container that no longer exists, as do all the other references to the East key I've come across so far.
---
Isn't it pickable?
---
you never stay in team for long man
---
I'd love a working Nuka Cola machine, where I can stock it with up to 40 colas of any flavor that will display in the door and let me set prices for them.
---
Smaller than the other vendors, only takes Nuka Cola but nullifies their weight and can even make them cold if they sit long enough.
---
I‚Äôll never turn down a free radium rifle.  I got two yesterday as event rewards.  I even learned the stinging mag mod from one.  It was a big day for me.
---
I typically break down any and all vanilla weapons and armor, unless it‚Äôs Uranium Fever and I can just make 1400 caps in one go off shotguns, assault rifles and glowing meat steaks.  Learning mods is useful, and more steel is always good.
---
Are you running into issues finding things to sell to make your daily 1400 caps?
---
I can't remember the guaranteed damage contribution needed to loot Queen, was it only 1k?
---
So kinda like medieval beer?
---
1,500, I believe.
---
H*ll yeah
---
Late night is the best time to do this event.
---
Thank you. After I deal good amount of damage I just tab target on VATS on anything that moves, Exp is good since stuff just keeps coming out.
---
Unfortunately I'm on Xbox one
---
Someone told me it has to he 50 hacked by one character. I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs any though to that. I‚Äôm sitting in 54 across a few characters
---
It doesn't really matter someone wanted to help u and rushed to help u like most good people so it really does not warrant being a dick. Just saying, hope u find what ur looking for
---
Do you have multiples characters? Or playing on a character that is from the beta period?
---
But wont that just open the lunches when I click on it, then I need to run 76 through the Bethesda launcher anyways. 
---
Plus when I try to add non-steam games it won't let me add launchers. I wanted to add star citizen  RSI launcher and escape from tarkoves battlestate launcher as well, but it wouldn't let me add either of those.
---
Pretty much, yes. But it's an absurdly low chance.   
---
Quests work as well, I got mine from a daily quest.
---
Both but my alt character is fresh and I'm sure I've done over 50
---
I'm not your pal, buddy.
---
Sounds like it to me.
---
Don't tell them to stop, they'll start throwing in dirty water instead, or worse.... Bobby pins
---
Yes, and it's one of the dumbest things about the game. A free economy is one of the most important things in an MMO but bethesda doesn't seem to understand that.
---
How was i supposed to know the game works in the early lvls? I wasted my stuff on all sorts of stupid perks. And i thought very carefully over time to get a heavy gunner build wich works fine. But we should still have the option to switch special points at one point or another without spending 10+ hours leveling up just for that
---
I doubt this would ever be implemented. 
---
But if it was, there would have to be some strict limitations and high costs. 
---
For example, a limited number of times you could do this, or you could only add on a tertiary effect, for example. Or it has to be from an identical base item (no moving a Reduced Weight mod from a Switchblade over to a Super Sledge).
---
Maybe at the cost of a Legendary Module from Murmrgh, you can only do this once every 20
---
Hours, it destroys the donor item, and can only be used to move a Tertiary Effect.
---
Not gonna lie, if someone gifted me those instead of the 300 marine tactical masks I would appreciate it.
---
Make sure that you pick up the magazines in the world in order for them to count. If you buy them from another player it won‚Äôt count for the 20 you need to get.
---
Plenty of people still play it, and it does make money.
---
Well I'm on xbox and had problems with a few achievements and challenges not unlocking on my original character from the beta, but then when I started playing on a new character it unlocked them. Dont think I had to redo all of them just had to let the challenge counter catch up, but this was a long time ago for me, and on another console so......ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Hope it works out for you. Good luck
---
Yer at one point in heat of battle lol I did notice the health line stopped before reaching the red were it should have gone higher, but after she's dead on the last fight i was ready and just watch the rad line go from above nerd rage say 30% to dead in less that 2 seconds, I did auto respawn on an earlier one but died instantly again with a total freeze
---
Yep will do that, thanks
---
I can say at first i was against cross play because pc has a lot of cheaters, but now im actually for it and only because it would open up the market and maybe lower some prices on things i want, plus make more available. It would make sense to combine them.
---
Yep. You actually have to find them yourself otherwise they won't count.
---
Wasn‚Äôt there a thing in one of the previous games for cold drinks?
---
Yea well i guess its likley due to server limitations
---
If you really invest in commando and bloody perks, that gun is truly outstanding.  I encourage you to build around it.  I‚Äôm certain that once the 10mm SMG gets a suppressor option, it‚Äôll spike in popularity.
---
Lol but don't worry. A bank will later be added to the fallout 1st membership to remedy it.
---
nota bug. its designed that way
---
You should. When I originally bought it I only played it for a week. It was full of bugs, crashed within minutes, and had some serious lag. Deleted it from my PS4 and bought and played some other games. Picked up Outer Worlds and went through it quickly. The only thing I had left was Destiny 2 which I got for free a while ago but I only play it with my sister in law when she's on. I get bored with games fairly quickly so I said fuck it and downloaded and installed 76 again. Been playing it for about a week or so and the player experience is much better. It's got a learning curve which takes a little to figure out and still some issues with lag (if someone with a shitty connection comes near me my game experience slows down for a few) but it's much better than before. It's easy to get lost in if you don't strictly follow the main quest and just go places. Best case scenario you have fun. Worst case scenario it sucks. You'll never know though unless you give it a go again.
---
Jesus christ who the FUCK cares, I'm sick of seeing these whiny posts from jealous people who don't have items when the last thing that fucking matters is if some guy has all 4 masks when there are literally hundreds of other REAL problems that actually DIRECTLY AFFECT everybody who's playing. Psyker girl you jealous petty bitch posting about some rando's camp cause you want Bethesda to punish them cause if you don't have them nobody else is exactly whats wrong with the community.
---
lmao. loooovvveeee iiittt!!!
---
Better yet why isn't the nuka cola plant a workshop?
---
Out of all the things going wrong with the game you had to post about some rando having 4 masks in his camp? That's pretty pathetic
---
Currently any friends can join. This is changing in a future update.
---
I actually think a Feed The People type of event would be better there.
---
I waited until Black Friday a the month after it came out and I got it for around $22
