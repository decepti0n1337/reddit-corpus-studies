Sleep to get the well rested bonus, eat cranberry relish and canned meat stew and always do the path to enlightenment when it shows up for the xp buffs

---
---
Apex, probably
---
I 100 % agree with you, I just dont wanna see them dropping like candy. I enjoy having something to grind for in these events. I have everything from meat week. They made that one to easy lol.
---
Now I've got absolutely no interest in PvP, but a civil war reenactment with old school weapons and clothing would be awesome! Also a protestors Vs strikebreakers event would be dope- imagine only having melee protest signs equipped and going up against waves of robots
---
Kill everything you can, do the daily's or events, if you have rank 3 inspiration(under charisma) you get +15%(?) Exp if you're in a group. Questing helps too. If you havent done the Order of Mysteries quest line it's long and takes you a lot of places with plenty of enemies to kill
---
Good rule of thumb: give your game a 30 count before pressing any buttons when first logging in to a server
---
Are you mocking my lv5 bloodied shovel!? XD
---
Good post - so it's not pure RNG but a constructed ( kind of ) RNG.  So to speak.
---
Gotcha thanks good luck

wth‚Ä¶.. bro no need to get freaking triggered..... I just hit 428 on my main..... no sure why your give me grief, "hey I got high level friends"

What‚Äôs your PSN? I run with a group of 3 and we could use a 4th for this raid on expert and perhaps some extra standard runs for the weekly challenge. We‚Äôre all 300 and 400+.
---
üëç
---
Yoda?
---
No more super mutants Scorched now
---
They could have us clean out our stashes and fill in the cracks to inaugurate a new more spacious stash.
---
Exactly. 2 or 3 is great. Other second effects will help more than a 4th ap, such as poison or radiation resistance, or extra strength.
---
You can also get ap refresh from being well tuned, and from lone wander and rejuvenated.
---
Beyond I think two? pieces of ap armor, you get minimal benefit from action boy/girl.
---
how bout a flag/patch editor so we can make our own.
---
What else is a level 30 going to sell?
---
Just like most people in this Sub,  I feel part of the family now.
---
I knew the structure of that sentence was unclear.
---
Suppressor is the perk card where you take less damage from who you‚Äôre attacking, and it‚Äôs already a legendary effect
---
Don't forget the constant "make three stars/rare more obtainable" posts on the front page. Those irk me the most.
---
What's the legendary effect?
---
üòÇ
---
On a semi-related note, they're all dead. Which is admittedly getting redundant at this point, when I'm being sent on search and rescue missions and I already know there won't be anyone to rescue. Looking forward to NPCs in Wastelanders. Then maybe I'll actually finally get to rescue someone.
---
If you have pacifist on you still get damage?
---
Also Suppressor‚Äôs
---
Raid armor PA set. It's a reward. Players are locking up other players simply by wearing it near them. Fucking SUCKS.
---
I'm pretty sure they took that off a while back
---
Good bot
---
DE is double explosive! However they‚Äôre super rare so wouldn‚Äôt be common knowledge
---
dang.
---
Oh good deal! Thanks
---
&gt;Found her a couple of times myself recently.
---
I'm just imagining someone sneaking around to move her body somewhere else. "Didn't I just see her dead body over there?" Either that or it's zombies confirmed.
---
Ya but the commenter was referring to damage perks with an AAE handmade.
---
Otherwise yes DE would be double explosive.
---
Makes sense but I still don't understand why fo3 and fnv are relatively stable on xb1. I had my first crash in fnv tonite and I'm at around 60 hours.
---
Fair. Didn‚Äôt notice he mentioned perks specifically
---
Sadly this did happen to me. All my accounts and all my toons ... :(
---
How do you see which mods you still need to unlock?
---
considering the mismatching credentials thing is *still* a thing, I believe you.
---
time to change passwords.
---
I thought it was scorchbeasts too, I wasn't really expecting the goal to be reached, scorched makes a whole lot more sense,
---
I heard there was post floating around with Player login information but assumed it was hearsay. Amazed there are people out there that would stoop so low? Its just a game... but at the end of the day, deleting someones accounts is straight bullshit. Seriously hope Beth is able to give you back your account or something. Keep your head up man
---
thanks guys!
---
Any horde event will be led by a ledge.
---
He will post here in a minute with actual proof of what I‚Äôm saying here, I‚Äôll remember to link it.
---
Making those big bucks.
---
Umm id say its ur net not the game. Im on a regular Xb1 and never lag except at the SBQ witch is a given.
---
Its gone forever as i logged out. The 3 legendary compensate for the lost. Worth 120scrips
---
is there a thing for putting in your own radio station ?
---
Seriously. Y'all want me to buy atoms with real money? Give us a ghoul skin.
---
I thought I was the only one who thought of this. I also like the idea of making the next ones slightly different so that those who have the original year one ones will have something special.
---
Some mods like paint can only be obtained from ones that spawn in the world so that could be some missing for armor too.
---
Read the convo to my coworker and she agreed you did not come off well. I get you responding improperly as many of us do. Lets just call it a wash and move on.
---
When editing a gun/armor/etc it will show it in the top right corner of the crafting menu
---
If so, they‚Äôd make it underarmor and you‚Äôd never see its coolness.
---
right now some 60s spooky music like monster mash or jeepers creepers could help. and make it feel more old than retro. i suggest maybe finding a pre-existing structure.
---
For a lower level account some people made some weapons and armor for me. It was a really cool experience. I like how this community helps each other out.
---
TODD WILL LIKE TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
---
Download spotify. It links to your ps4 and you can choose from your phone without minimizing the game
---
I couldnt start anthem so i took the hint and never tried to. 
---
And im all for that 50% off, but it was cool to role play a scorched hunter for a bit not gunna lie.
---
ALL HAIL THE SUPREME LEADER TODD!
---
Pretty sure they specified that they did not
---
Oh no he‚Äôs going to kill someone else.
---
How many days from the time you brought it to their attention till it was fixed? And how many special points was it, do you remember?
---
They took the graffiti off? Well then, that might be what I spend my banked up atoms on
---
This is pretty much my build except I moved 3 of those points from intelligence to luck for serendipity. I am also a carnivore and even with only 2 points in strength and no unarmed I do 1500 sneak crit dmg to the queen when she lands using an unstoppable monster üò¨
---
I haven't been hit by a king since 94 dropped, but my pet king fought off two deathclaws that spawned near my CAMP without even taking damage... That was odd.
---
Bloodied combat rifles are like hen‚Äôs teeth! I finally got one two days ago for 4000 caps (two star, +10% when aiming) and I love it! Now I need one for my commando! Or better still a bloodied fixer. Two of my toons have fixer plans, so when the sale is on....
---
I smell a 'purchase atoms and get this new outfit' situation on the horizon.
---
I would fetch pumpkins for old Jack if they weren‚Äôt by a fissure site.
---
I mean.. I have a display case by my vendors with some plastic pumpkins and the Spooky and Candy Mr Fuzzy plushies in it. I hung up some Fastnacht for at least a little seasonal look. I just want to hang up some Halloween decorations.. I love spooky time of the year and I'd love to share it with the 76 crowd too. I'll just crawl through the menus some more to see if I can come  up with more stuff. Maybe plant a bunch of corn in front of my place....
---
Good to know, thank you.
---
I'd like to know this with the 50% Crit damage perk on guns also
---
Really? Because they all look pretty dead when I play the game.
---
Maybe its actually very small and giving away a few things would reveal too much so they have to be quite
---
Dont dupe
---
Was it cold?
---
And it only gives a non-descriptive number. Like 25/35, it doesn't tell you which specific mods you have left to unlock
---
Yup, pretty much the main reason I run Excavator, also with the server spawn bug that gives you an extra 100 carrying it you‚Äôre wearing it when you spawn in.
---
It sucks scrolling for the weapons you want to use though ü§£
---
I didnt equip tat.. didnt know why i jump in also. Haha
---
I hope he doesn't blow up OPs kitchen!
---
Has Beth said who the new humans will be yet? Where are they coming from? I read posts in here about factions. Is this all just speculation? Is there definitely going to be NPC followers?
---
You can kinda role play as one
---
Early on, when I was level 40 or so, a 200+ stopped by my camp for water. He dropped three mutations on me and built me a fusion generator. Since then I try to do one good deed a week to pay it forward. Last week I dropped a t51b with jet pack and Nuka cola paint on a level 41. Just taking up stash space and hardly used it. Told him to pay it forward. I hope we all do this when we can. Once you hit a certain level, caps, mats, and drops become irrelevant.
---
Exactly
---
Yep!
---
Kill lots of creatures
---
There are definitely going to be followers. But they'll mostly just stay at you camp.
---
Damn man, that really sucks... Hope you get it back.
---
This is why we desperately need 2FA on our Beghesda accounts, and it's ridiculous that in 2019 it still isn't an option. Even simple email 2FA would be better than nothing.
---
/u/valseek, /u/ladydevann
---
Yeah it's pretty dumb watching all the level 400s melt shit with explosive plasma gats. I try to team up with people when I do that event to expand the loot pool. Sadly it usually gets declined and all the assholes proceed to blow everything up. That's when I spam nades.
---
Awe yeah
---
Looks like my stash. One great star with two useless ones... sigh. At least the reduced weight items let you hold more garbage! üòÇ that sledge is nice though!
---
I‚Äôve been hearing about this all day, I vouch. Hope you get some help.
---
u/valseek, u/ladydevann maybe y‚Äôall can help
---
They nerfed events into the ground. Other than that they haven‚Äôt made any big changes. Or any improvements in my eyes. Other than adding the fixer into the legendary purveyor. But that‚Äôs really not saying much because it should have been in the drop tables from the start.  But let me tell you all the great things in the atom shop that you missed. Liberty prime power armor with voice module. Free states bundle that cost as much as the game on release. A greenhouse that could only be bought in a bundle, a robot that collects scrap and a fridge. Oh yeah and scrap kits and repair kits.
---
Dude, I would love some Enclave stuff.
---
Give me Enclave diiiiiigs
---
If the vendor is in a low level area...I don't mind. It's the camps set up at whitesprings and further east that are full of random crap that frustrate me.   
---
No, we don't need mole miner gauntlets and white wolf fedoras.
---
You forgot to mention the meat stacking. Nice dmg! I‚Äôm up to 7k :(. Is that a bpa meathook?
---
The ambient sounds are amazing.
---
This happened to me same day. I was able to recover it pretty quickly but they did to take a good 20-30 items from my account
---
[removed]
---
There's this infrequent moaning sound of large metal machinery slowly grinding that is the most haunting sound in the whole game.
---
I think metal jesus has a video about console sweaters
---
Welcome to the graveyard. This is where they all go to "die" and is actually kinda handy for finding out how long a server's been online. If you're thinking about launching a nuke, it's not a horrible idea to start here, and server hop until you end up on a server where there aren't any... and if you're on a server where there are 10+, just...don't.
---
It‚Äôs actually 33 bits of 3* armour then you can scrap 6 bits and get another 4-5 bits back, I‚Äôve got 3.5k saved up across 4 alts level 50+ :)
---
Easy fix, rename your weapons and it's much easier. ;)
---
That sucks and I hope you can get it fixed!
---
Does this affect all systems?
---
Totally agree that 3* is better for armor.
---
That‚Äôs a very good idea lol
---
An FFR Weightless Crylator for 2000 caps. I don't even use heavies, but I'm displaying that fucker on my wall.
---
Hi displaying that fucker on my wall., I'm dad.
---
The amount you have done. I use a bloody electrified Mr handy buzz blade on SBQ and hold position(her face) and its drains that bar.
---
For all you players planning on leaving... leave me your stuff.
---
You must be on the wrong sub, this is for Fallout 76
---
Maybe by people playing the game.
---
 Nice.  Thanks
---
I mean it's not like 76 has a radio announcer like the other games, so listening to a playlist instead of the in game radio doesn't really make a difference. If anything it's better since you can skip/pause/replay/etc songs, and you won't have to listen to 16 tonnes 16 times in a row
---
I had this issue when I had a huge farm. I had about 30-40ish plants of tato, corn, and mutifruit for making adhesive.
---
Turns out farms are big draws on your budget. Now I have a three story house on a mountain side with a cow and robot catapult on top. I don't grow any more veggies but razorgrain.
---
It was pretty clear, the cause.
---
Automatron
---
How long can it possibly take to resolve what should be a simple fix?
---
I found this spreadsheet somewhere: 
---
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ZhGrawX03LlZtS9smKLqcC2LT875f5V\_qPFefn79OM/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ZhGrawX03LlZtS9smKLqcC2LT875f5V_qPFefn79OM/edit#gid=0) 
---
Can't attest to it's accuracy. Have Scrapper perk equipped and intelligence buffed when scrapping for best chance of learning mods.
---
You gotta deconstruct other combat armor to get or, or maybe get lucky and find someone selling plans for it.
---
Otherwise it's a random drop.
---
There is a pet taming system?
---
Please tell me how. I wanna launch more stuff off my roof.
---
In the mountains behind white powder winter sports. It‚Äôs in the same area as the quest Rose sends you on to tame a deathclaw.
---
Andy redo your post without the ... on the end of the title. That appears to be why the bot keeps taking it down.
---
They added the floor traps. Build your camp on a tall mountain, and place them around where your bramin or scrap robot spawns/exits his booth and they become catapult ammunition.
---
That's about it.
---
35 pipe pistols here i come!
---
Rewards are moot. Your after the steel and being that there is no timer you dont need a team rushing thru thr place.
---
I have run 1 solo and completed it. I think another may be possible but i died twice and wasn't in the mood to try again. Fairly certain they can all be solo'd tho.
---
It's a ammo/aid hog going in alone as some parts never stop spawning mobs.
---
So your basicly operating at a loss for the steel so when you do get plans from timed runs can quickly craft some armor.
---
Always on xbox, not so much PC lately.
---
This is how I got my highest-level Raider PA.  I've heard that there's an alternate dialogue that plays sometimes too
---
Wait till you deal with a trading facebook page. some of the rudest and insane stuff ever
---
I agree with the guy too, you're both correct
---
It...it got deleted.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm not on the FB pages but one of my friends says the same thing about them. Kinda weird that people in true name would be total jerks on that platform
---
This is helpful, thank you.
---
That would make sense, especially since you can find Scorched already undergoing the petrification process.
---
Lol, this is like the 5th time we‚Äôve tried avoiding the auto mod too. Don‚Äôt mean to accuse or jump the gun, but does that mean an actual mod had to remove it?
---
Some mods strictly by plans. Others depends on level of weapon. For example, I thought I got every single hunter rifle mod by farming the lumber yard. Those super mutants are all lvl 1-5 and a single one star legendary.
---
I went to iron works, and later busting scortched in the Bog, and was greeted with many new mods when I started to decon them again. Iron works guns are lvl 20-30 and bog guns were lvl 40-50.
---
So no proof, but I do think gun level has something to do with it.
---
Im on the right sub its not my fault i dont experiance lag/frame drop unlike others.
---
Animal Friend and Wasteland Whisperer perks I'm pretty sure. I tamed animals a few times but it was such a glitchy system that I kind of gave up,. They die easily and it's pretty sad. But having a big Deathclaw roaming your CAMP and defending you is pretty cute
---
You have renewed my faith in Reddit.
---
Well thats unfortunate huh?
---
Facebook calls for aid! And reddit shall answer!
---
I just helped you clear the cabins...you need a shotgun
---
whatever you do, dont let people know you are pro-raider
---
Assuming low level 
---
Take workshop, defend, server hop and repeat .
---
Minimal chance of jerk griefers. 
---
If that's an issue, start your take,  stealth and server hope without doing the defend event
---
Saw this Sunday night on the road north to Point Pleasant, just past the Ordnance Storage. 
---
4 dead Bramin, and a little further up the road another 6 still milling around. So I moved closer, but when I stood up (Cham armor) they all dropped dead.  
---
I think I scared them üòï
---
I feel ya dude been subject to the same shit. You‚Äôre lucky no one has shit down your neck in this thread. Typical on reddit.
---
Good to know. I'm max budget all the time but no farming. I likely should downsize
---
I make sure to not use explosives with my explosive builds because that's 5 points to put into power armor based perks. im currently building a bloodied PA character
---
and you wouldn't be able to launch it it is not affected by your camp items...i have tried this
---
Both
---
Same thing happened to me near the cemetery in TV.
---
If this was on Xbox I think I know the guy, he‚Äôs a big role player, I‚Äôll point him to this post
---
In my opinion Facebook has had its day.
---
Once it was great for keeping in touch with friends/family.
---
Then it started leaning to the left.
---
It went so far Left,that it disappeared over the Horizon.
---
Now It is full of woke Neo-liberals, that are offended by everything,and anything.Dissecting every post looking to find something offensive.
---
I got 32k how many you have to sell?
---
As much criticism as Reddit gets, I genuinely believe Facebook will cause the fall of civilization.
---
Last I checked, just over 80.
---
I tune into the Hunter Hunted radio all the time and no one ever joins. &gt;;/
---
Can't remember the perk in luck that cripples for heavy gun but if you queen fight have that equipped and hit her legs when she lands to keep her steady so mele can hit the heavy dmg. And if you use lock and load in str it makes .50 cals and LMGs reload like a dream putting more rounds down range quicker.
---
Grafton station has tons of plans. Server hop it.
---
I quit FB in January. I don't miss it.
---
Sadly PC! I should have specified.
---
I have scrapped hundreds of pieces of combat armor. I guess it‚Äôs just a stupid rare plan from robot vendors.
---
Scrapped 3 Tenderizers
---
Intentionally
---
Then learned what they're selling for 
---
üò°
---
I‚Äôm still excited to play it but the combat isn‚Äôt the draw for me. The game itself looks quirky and in same vein as Fallout and I‚Äôm into that.  Everyone heaps tons of love on Obsidian for NV (and it isn‚Äôt exactly undeserved) but it‚Äôs combat was just a cut and paste of FO3 and Outer Worlds looks like more of the same.
---
Yes i have had that feature occur in all of the fallout games.
---
I don't have tons of hours and only lvl 89 PA/HW and wasn't playing pre-nerf but they did patch energy weapons that are anti-armor so they now work so say an anti-armor explosive Gatling plasma would be really really good still and would keep them in your loadouts.
---
Ah! Okay sounds like a cool guy regardless
---
According to ceddit it was deleted within 1 second, that's either automod or a human with ADHD
---
But, you put in a good word with U/Ladydevann about getting me a pristine Mr. Fuzzy costume, and I'll give them to you.
---
Where do you get one?
---
Uh huh.
---
I don‚Äôt know what to say man, I waited like 5 min to make sure it stuck. Not saying your wrong, just that I‚Äôm tired and I‚Äôm not sure how to even post anymore without getting auto-modded to death.
---
Yes, modding the legs adds 50 pounds for a increase of 100 pounds. The Excavator (full) set adds another 100 pounds. And, if you spawn into the world already in your Excavator PA, you sometimes get ANOTHER 100 pound boost.
---
If you're going for radium mods... Get ready to grind. Its ridiculously low chance. People have gone thru 100s of them without getting them all.
---
Gimme a liberator faction. I'm tired of running this dinky communist free store all by myself.
---
The game lags for everyone on the server when 1000 nuke mines load in for the same reason there are limits to camp build areas and stash size: the engine can't handle it. Glad to hear you haven't run into it yet.
---
Sorry no advice here, I just went to ceddit to see what the post said but it was marked as deleted within 1 second.
---
Just cause it doesn't happen to you, doesn't mean it isn't happening to others.
---
Seems to be a trend on this sub, "well I don't get hiccups or lag so it's YOUR SETUP" I see pretty frequently. But with consoles that is basically saying "your net is shit" and many of those occasions the OP will point out they're using high speed (incredibly high speed compared to my 30/4 cable). Could be the person's rig as far as PC goes, but if you look at all the topics regarding the issue it spans all levels of hardware, new &amp; old...its definitely not down to one single factor in every single instance, nor do I think all these people are lying about it.
---
I've spent some time trying to get my PC to run it as smoothly as it runs any other game, including but not limited to FO4. Far more time that one should probably have to spend getting a game of this era to work *as it should.* Again, it's restricted to FO76 and no other game I have installed (something like 30-40 I'd have to double check).
---
So to reiterate, just cause your in the group that doesn't have the issues, doesn't magically make them nonexistent.
---
Honestly not sure why people think there are so many assholes in this game, the mechanics severely limit anyones ability to be an asshole. The majority left due to boredom long ago and even then there werent many. Honestly while meeting anyone in game I‚Äôve ran into very little people who have tried to mess with me, even in the days with camp destruction and slap damage. In fact I‚Äôm way more asshole than any of the players I‚Äôve met in through in game encounter and I don‚Äôt consider myself to be a total bully just half one
---
Ive noticed this. Sometimes it takes a little while to catch up. Wait a bit then go back and i vet it will work for you
---
Thanks, I started FO4 tonight when I got home to check.
---
I‚Äôll try linking again if he gets it to work properly, basically just outlines how he was hacked and how close to 100 other accounts have been hacked with usernames and passwords posted online. Plenty of pics and proof for it too, just having issues tryina get the post to stay.
---
I love stumbling across someone like that! I typically play alone because I‚Äôm melee only and really as at battle so I assume it‚Äôll annoy everyone else when I just want to scavenge but once in a while I find someone really patient and kind. It‚Äôs so fun! It‚Äôs enough that I‚Äôve actually considered picking up a headset so I can chat. Not quite there yet, but close...
---
Or they could make it like the deathbrand armor in Skyrim where it‚Äôs individual pieces but when all worn together it‚Äôs armor and each piece has a different skill, one leg increased carry weight, the other minus fall damage and yada yada
---
In Fallout 4, Critical hits changed from a % chance per shot to a meter you build and choose when to use in Vats. So, in Vats is where you get to use your critical bonuses.
---
Interesting thing I found out: the head shot multiplier also effects critical hit damage.
---
Nice shooting everyone!!!
---
There have already been what, twenty odd posts about the jetpack skin that state it's \_just a skin\_ so if the power armor does not have a jetpack, you cannot put that skin on that power armor.
---
Serum recipes are in the Whitesprings Bunker, you'll have to do the Enclave quests to get to them; they're over 20000 caps. Or, luck up and find another player selling them cheap at their camps. I found someone selling them for 349 caps the other night.
---
They used to drop from Queen fights, but now the best you can do is bump up Charisma and buy them from Whitespring‚Äôs enclave bunker.
---
I think I saw you on my server 2 nights ago
---
If there is too much of the usernames or passwords visible in the pictures it will get manually removed for sharing personal info. 
---
Also just FYI a hack on bethesda would get a lot more than 100 accounts, it's more likely to be a phishing scheme, or a virus on end user machines.
---
Playing Fortnite for a bit, mostly until wastelanders comes out.
---
Ironic, I do the same thing while grading student papers sometimes. It's great for someone who likes to procrastinate: "hey someone is nuking the sbq, time for a break."
---
Toy trucks and cars have them, typewriters, etc....
---
Yeah it IS insane.  Most games have their RAREST items at a 1% drop chance at the LOWEST.  That still means a possibility of 100 runs to get what you want, but .03% is almost thousands of runs...
---
350 for serum recipes? I find that HARD to believe,  but in any case sounds like a duper for sure trying to offload for easy fast turning caps, i know i have mine in my vendor for 14k all mine were queen drops,  hence the 14k price tag
---
I hate you. 
---
I've gotten one single star in the last three runs.
---
Oh i always look in every section im case its not featured!  For this very reason!
---
Not the recipe, it was the serum itself. I wasn't aware that the sometimes dropped from the SBQ!
---
Usually most issues in the CAMP system are fixed by exiting the build system an reopening or reloading on a new sever.
---
Monster mash is fun solo. As soon as the "OMG I GET TO MURDER PEOPLE AND NOT GO TO PRISON" Brigade shows up it pretty much kills the fun entirely.
---
That was originally done by clowndaddy, if you look on youtube and look him up you will see his videos. Unfortunately he has moved on to other characters which in my opinion are no where as funny as his clown was....
---
See second edit above
---
Yes, USED to.....it was patched out last December ish time frame.....back when the queen actually dropped worth while stuff
---
I'm sure they feel they've got bigger fish to fry, but when part of the excuse for non-cosmetic cash-shop items is "you can earn that currency in game" this starts to feel kind of insulting.
---
I mean, at least maybe not REPEAT the broken challenges? Like, months after these bugs have been reported? "Oopsie daisy we gave you a challenge that's broken!" is a lot different to "Oopsie we never fixed this challenge and left it in the rotation 3 months in a row."
---
Tried both, solution found and stated in post. Thanks.
---
Send me your PSN, we have an open spot and more people tends to help
---
If you‚Äôre on PC shoot me your IGN, I‚Äôd be more then happy to come and chat with you and see all your wares in your vendor :D
---
What‚Äôs the cap at?
---
Consider "speaking for yourself" dude.   
---
While I agree with a few of your points (I would, indeed, enjoy a higher SPECIAL limit, and more stash space, and carry weight)   
---
A SHITLOAD of us really do enjoy the hunting/cooking/base-building side of the game.   
---
A hot-swapable set of pre-build card loadouts would be nice, too.
---
Scrip has always been capped at 1k
---
I don't think there's a guaranteed radscorpion spawn anywhere but if you team up you can do the cave cricket one pretty easy. Go to Tangara town and injur one of the crickets in the tree, fast travel to the caverns then have your teammate kill the one you injured. You can also do it solo with mines but it's a bit more unpredictable.
---
If you're referring to the cap of 1000, you're looking mighty foolish.
---
Yay! Now I can complete my collection of Assaultron heads with Faster reload speed and +1 Perception at a cheaper cost!  Obviously this is sarcasm but instead of a 50% cost, how about a +50% bonus to rng rolls?
---
Add MuerteGusanos. Im usually on during the night everyday for 3-4of hours.
---
wat? there has been a cap since the system launched.  150/ 20 hour vendor cooldown, and 1000 total
---
Nukacrypt.com does.
---
in before truth bombs
---
My bloodied AAE eats through pretty much everything better than any weapon I have, my other handmade is a TSE that does alright but not as high damage. That is a nice weapon...
---
Nope, just 76 üòÅ
---
Been 1k since they released it my dude.
---
Confirmed OP is right they did fix it. Just did all three in the past hour or so and I got one. That‚Äôs something lol
---
don't forget the flamer skin as well (even though next to nobody uses the thing)
---
lol derp
---
As everyone knows bethesda uses a shitty program to run Fo76. Yes duping is a issue but till bethesda bans them all together and gets rid of the loop holes we will continue to have problems. But lag can also be caused from players on the servers weighing over 2,000 lbs that in itself causes lag.as does all of our camps and what we have in our stashes.
---
Thanks for the help :)
---
S‚Äôall good buddy
---
No worries. I'd be lost without that site.
---
Hey your right they definitely fixed it. I did get 1 out of the 3 events today! It came from stings and things. First one in a LONG time!
---
Oh well, damn. I started playing after that time - so I missed that boat. Have you managed to sell many recipes at 14K?
---
In the Atom store.  Picture only shows female version thou.
---
i scripped a 3* legendary flamer yesterday so this hit close to home..
---
.... how does your foot taste?
---
Check yourself before you wreck yourself dingus
---
I feel like you put in that video despite the fact I said NOT the sugar grove route on purpose.
---
They definitely dialed back the badge drops. I do the dailies everyday and campfire tales when I see it and average a badge a week.
---
Yea for the ones that stumble upon my tiny camp, yes, at 14k a pop some folks see them and message me to stay so they can return with their bank and make a purchase 14 is way better than 20k....
---
Recently began doing that after finishing most of the actual storyline, the caps do start piling up. That vendor cap limit is a bit of a pain however.
---
I don't have int higher than 5 and haven't had a problem with commando.  I take grafton steel every once in a while.  Converted ammo factory is nice but it's also bullshit.  The ammo producer doesn't give the same amount of ammo for every type so it's either great or a big fucking gyp.
---
No way? For real? Who would of thunk it.   
---
Though it never hurts to see if anyone else found it.
---
I think they added the backpack in the last patch or the one before that. Doesn't hold much, but should help out low levels a bit.
---
Zeronial, I tried doing the two weekly challenges for the raid but when it came down to the last two runs everyone disappeared or flaked lol. I hope the frames are obtainable next week.
---
I have to agree specially were it counts under ur camp buget it should be fixable or auto respawn.
---
It's the fact that I worked hard for the scout quest for it to now its just given to people....
---
That's what I was afraid of. Thanks Vault Dweller
---
I managed to get both photo frames so far, looking to get all 3. Adding you now
---
The one with Pioneers is better and upgradable. This one is not. Don't be salty!
---
That one isn't upgradable, so don't be upset!
---
Thanks for asking the question, I was curious about what it was and did the second best thing to asking a question on reddit:)
---
Put a sign over her that says "my ex-GF"
---
Yeah I know, I did too. Kinda sucks that they made it easier to get after all the hard work.üòÅ
---

---
I don't get what Bethesda means it's difficult to change the timers. 
---
I mean I understand what they're saying BUT it seems a possible solution is to remove some events off the timer. 
---
All these events existed without the timer, just remove some of them back to the old system, leave the hardest of them on the timer. Keep encryptid (actually that isn't dependent of the timer), paradise and so on but eliminate others. 
---
I'm sure there's plenty of people that would appreciate less players at "uranium fever"
---
Awesome.  I won't be on tonight, but I'll send you a friend request.
---
Hmm on Xbox I never really struggle to find matches at all. And I‚Äôve Ben playing at all kinds of times recently.
---
Permit me to recommend watching one of oxhorn's quest playthroughs, like Mistress of Mysteries, together. He has a knack for showing off the story elements of the game. Might be just the thing to get her interested.
---
Rip on missing liberty prime power armor
---
It‚Äôs not the same one.  
---
The ‚Äúgiveaway‚Äù only holds 20 or 30, and AFAIK cannot be modded.
---
THe scout badge one holds up to 50 or 60, and can be modded
---
Any speculation on how it was done?
---
A hundred or so accounts can't be so easily aquired by randomly hammering some large leaked email &amp;password combons from somewhere else, into Fallout 76. Was his or the other's emails available publicly? (if you or someone sees a list of them, google few?)
---
Smells a bit like a mod could have been the route. Normally I don't bother changing passwords as the closest to any "hack" I've been was like 15 years ago a friend got his stupid hotmail broken and my email address went public from his address book.
---
I took a few months off and just came back recently and I've noticed the game was running far worse than I remember. I get constant lag but also frame drops and stuttering and I thought maybe it was something on my end.
---
I really wish they would increase the stash limit.
---
I have done the event too many times. In some occasions, with the perfect group of strangers, each one of us taking care of a certain spot and shooting before they can know what hit them. Like special ops going pro, really pro. 
---
Still, even with undamaged extractors working 100 percent of the time, I think I never got the full extraction ending.
---
Try using a ssd drive. Load times are a significant shorter and lags alot less in all areas of the game. Fast traveling to major events like queen and imposter would normally take a few mins for players and stuff to load in once traveled to but now everything loads in instantly and no fps drops at all.
---
I've gotten it before, that's what made me wonder. I asked the dataminers in the AMA, and they didn't know. I don't believe it's chance
---
It will probably be something from F4 anyway, that's what most of the $10 bundle armors have been, if they do something "spooky" it might be something like lorenzo's outfit \*shrug\*
---
they should not use cheat program and mayB they no lose stuff
---
It is now a "Public Event", and can no longer be activated by players.
---
Dropping it causes it to become a frame? Or did they remove that.
---
It will always say power armor chassis or what ever the nomenclature is, its no different dropping any other item, as soon as i got it from the BOS quest i dropped mine.....
---
Ooo ok but now I can only go down there when the event happens?
---
I've been just hopping on for an hour or so after work to help out newer players/low levels. I usually make a quick gun run through someplace and kill a bunch of creatires, take their crap and give to someone of my choosing so they can scrap or sell. Maybe not the most challenging bit it's my thing...
---
Yup!
---
I meant it as a joke lol not actually upset
---
Man that sucks but thank you for answering my questions though have a nice night/day
---
Poor, lonely, eventless bastard he might be. I am level 350 between all my characters,and I roleplay my days away looking for new things to do. 
---
Only thing that worked so far Is to nerf myself. My commando uses a .38 regular fixer and an instigating knife as His only weapons. 1 endurance.
---
on a side note, if all they're adding into the halloween event are re-used pack outfits/armor from Nuka world, my disappointment will be off the charts
---
Getting spit attacked by a Snallygaster and quickly tapping to pick up the chunks from the attack will add it to your inventory.  I got one by getting attacked head on while my pip-boy was up, the chunks floated on my screen for long enough to grab it.  Not really of any use though other than to show it off and perplex noobs
---
Oh many many many times.
---
All outfits are unisex, none of them are or likely ever will be for just one.
---
they still havent fixed most of the building bugs
---
Cool, I'll log onto him, add the perk card and check the requirements. I'll post back before you hop on.
---
For sure.  I never thought of that happening though.  I wonder if it was accidental or on purpose?  Never know.
---
Yeah I know, but it sounded like he was not part of the info-fest that is /fo76. I thought maybe I should not assume too much.
---
Harpers ferry vendor has a few but sadly the only way to  learn most is creating the gun then scrapping them.
---
I believe a list is going to be released by B just before the event starts. From what I've read just wearing the veil of secrets or a mask will also count rather than having to wear a full costume.
---
Not a big PVP fan so haven't seen much use for it. Maybe that will change with the Wastelanders update
---
xXDemolisher but i play PC lol
---
Well to be perfectly honest I didn't even find the video I was looking for. There's this German sounding girl who did a very in-depth video on screw runs and spring runs and I tried and tried but I couldn't find it.
---
I did try that but only when it first started happening, maybe something has changed :) I'll give it a shot thank you
---
Go to the settings of your graphics card and check if the game is using thw dedicated card. Sometimes (usually due to outdated drivers) some games default to the onboards one. I've not heard this problem reported for Fallout 76 on Nvidia cards  as Nvidia made Game Ready drivers for 76  but it may occur on other cards.
---
You could try running it in full screen instead of borderless that helped me
---
Sounds good
---
I have to say it only happens on some occasions, which has me believe it's server connected somehow (Just an assumption or theory as I have no actual proof of this) And you're welcome
---
I have a Nvidea card which has the most recent drivers. I have a 1080ti
---
It is in full screen
---
That happened to me and nuked my Xbox one.
---
I failed this event on the original quest: unexpected,  completely unprepared, and not much help for the players that joined.
---
Was in the same area a few weeks later, tracking down a U-Mine-It stash, when it kicked off and I figured I'd find a place to observe how it's done, and maybe do better next time. 
---
Already encumbered, I hiked as fast as I could and just made it to the event perimeter as it ended.
---
Got the WW Fedora, and was pissed off: I didn't EARN it, and I didn't learn anything.
---
Later, while dumping my mats, I realized I got The Fixer plans  üòØ
---
They're no better than vanilla. The only mod option on any arms is optimized bracers. The rest are total junk.
---
You will not receive plans for the armor from movie runs, so it is not worth it unless you already have the plans for the set you want
---
No duping involved. Just did a transfer of stuff from one character to another.
---
I hatee duping with a passion.
---
I run max martial artist and exclusively run +swing speed unarmed weapons, almost swings as fast as you can hit the button. 
---
Pretty sure there‚Äôs not a cap because I ran some knuckles that didn‚Äôt have +speed for a bit and they felt so slllooowwww.
---
leave vault when the leader crashes or leaves the vault in any way
---
link please for this 2nd raid solo?
---
You should have them automatically. Go in to your camp menu and at the top there will be an option for displays.
---
I still have the "Take the elevator down" at Arktos mission prompt. Could I start it this way since I've never done it?
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

I have all needed materials on hand, with the perk card on.

That‚Äôs great! Fun time you had! I‚Äôm an Aussie too - a girl gamer on PC. Usually never have a mic on tho, but most PC gamers don‚Äôt. I would have loved to team up with some fellow Aussies. Glad you had fun and shared your wares and adventures. Stay filthy!
---
Graham sells it. I bought one from him for my alt during meat week. It's about 12k can get it less if you have high charisma and hard bargain but you're still going to be looking at about 9k
---
Amazing work!
---
Ok thanks.  I've actually tried him, and he didn't have it.  I don't care about the cost.  I have too much caps  lol
---
This can happen when changing flooring, from planks to carpet for example.
---
Sells at any of the raider vendors.
---
Good for heavy weapon Vampguard builds. The Ultracite fires faster than a reggie gat laser anyway but does less damage per hit so it's good for vampires, it wants faster fire. Does it have a 3rd star?
---
Armor I think has less mods for it than weapons.
---
Absolute madness that you wouldn't wait for the sale btw
---
Phoniox in watoga has it as well
---
At this point I‚Äôm guessing wastelanders must be very BOS enclave and responder focused due to the lack of new atom shop for them.  Holding back the good stuff and all that.
---
He does have it but his inventory changes. The plan is a rare plan so it won't always be in his inventory
---
thank you :)
---
Oh cool cheers.
---
Maybe? What i do know is that we have no idea what kind of format or design or mechanics or whatever Wastelanders is going to be. Stand alone mode 2 years later that is seperate like NW is and Survival was? Fully incorporated into the sbq storyline? Who knows. Im pretty sure i wouldnt appreciate being forced to use a new character though. Maybe thats not what you meant im not sure. Ive put a lot of effort into my 4 characters, i wouldnt want to bench them for 2 to 3 months.
---
Welp, now I feel like an idiot. I assumed they were found plans or a quest reward. Thank you for the prompt answer, was very helpful.
---
Wow this is one of the most creative camps I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
No issue. I didnt know where they were initially either ü§£
---
I love it! When you meet through a hobby you know you have stuff in common.
---
What's the refresh rate of your monitor? There was a post a few days ago about someone needing to lock the refresh rate of their monitor to 60 to make the game playable.
---
I trashed the plan 3 times
---
The free states stuff was previously marketed as limited time so it's also disheartening to see it back so soon. I wouldn't mind seeing it months from now but we literally just had this stuff
---
Hope so
---
The issue is running suspicious programs in the first place, full stop.
---
I am having the same issue, having started nursing school this year. My PS4 recently died and had to go in for repairs, but this is a good idea for when I get it back.
---
That is what the elves call 'justice of the unicorn'.
---
We appreciate your service though. It is the thought that counts. üòÖ
---
I've come across literally two assholes in the game total. First was twice my level and tried to shoot me as I shopped at Murmurgh's then called me trash when I wouldn't fight back, second shot me just as I bought something from his own store, so I shot blew his head off and looted his paper bag because he was ungrateful.
---
Everyone else has been great. People want to team up, help each other out, and especially give newbies a leg up. It's a great friendly game.
---
Ultra renders a bunch of unnecessary shit. Easy fix:
---
1) Set your default to medium
---
2) up your textures, water, shadow to ultra again
---
3) don‚Äôt touch view distance sliders.
---
4) fullscreen/vsync on
---
5) enjoy smooth gameplay
---
That freestate stuff looks like 4th of the July items. Halloween stuff should be ready by Valentines Day 2020.
---
&gt;!what?!&lt;
---
Totally agree, I spent a whole month farming raids  for steel, crafted the power armor only to find it being completely useless. Literally the minute I crafted it, I went to test it on SBQ, with my weapon of choice being two shot explosive minigun.. and that's where I regretted using it - the cloud of acid particles around SBQ became so thick, that my game froze to a couple FPS and I couldn't move my mouse, the sound became distorted like something was about to explode.  Glad I stopped shooting and everything went back to normal when the acid particles dissipated. On my 4.2 ghz  i7-7700k, gtx 1080, normally I have around 70-140 fps but this armor coupled with high firerate heavy gun and explosive rounds makes a slideshow out of your game with a potential of crashing it (and for other people near you)
---
What?
---
Scout dailies and biv reset at 8 pm est
---
This looks sick! I love, love seeing camps like these. I'm always amazed at what some people can get away with in terms of the limited build budget in this game, haha.
---
id say its a good roll, the faster firing bonus may even make the charging barrels worth time to check them out
---
On PC.
---
How many $18 skins would you buy?
---
Dangit, I‚Äôm not sure when the robot models started autoscrapping, but they didn‚Äôt for the longest time and today I realized they‚Äôre all gone from my stash and must have autoscrapped while crafting. :(
---
I know how you feel. I've been trying to get mods for the trapper armor (not sure how many others use it) and have even made 7 of them before running out of rubber and broke them all down. No mods. Think I've only got about 2 out of 13 mods for it. 1 for arms and legs too

Hi. So a buddy just downloaded the game and is looking to play. It's my opportunity to make a new character. Your post inspired me. I'm gonna roleplay a CoA, using a gamma gun and a Mr. Handy Buzz Blade (melee weapon is still debatable). I made this build after seeing your post:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c3663fb&amp;d=ad2am2ak2al2a12cs1eu0la2l71lu2pb2s42sm2sn2lt2ej4sf2c72ir2&amp;w=&amp;m=ic2fe9&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
Essentially it's a bloodied build without bloodied weapons (debatable). The main weapon is the Gamma Gun so gunslinger perks. Also I run radcool that utilizes rads to increase my Str for the Buzz Blade and also add 50 rads per hit. With a VFast attack speed, it should apply quite a bit of rads. Thus allowing the glory of atom to be spread via ranged or melee. 
---
What do you think?
---
The refresh rate is 60 for my monitor
---
r/ihadastroke
---
You get my up vote. I agree whole heartedly
---
Nono - I'm not advocating forced benching of characters at all, apologies if that was not clear.
---
While connecting the new content or seasonal cosmetics to the fresh league works exceedingly well in the Path of Exile example, I don't think it's necessary (or even wise) to test the waters that way.
---
The ideal scenario would be for both methods of play to remain just as valid - and once a wave of "fresh" players get rolled into the "core" players, the result would hopefully be a net gain in "core" playerbase over time anyway.
---
If I remember correctly the chest lead lined you can get as a plan, but to get the limbs, that is scrapping. It's what I had to do, to unlock on mine.
---
How about not enough bang for the buck? Exp reward sucks, legendary reward sucks, time sink sucks. Not worth it. Change my mind (nvm, don't bother..)
---
Reddit has probably more than its fair share of issues but at least it ain't Facebook.
---
This is what the Unicorns call "Revenge of the Elves"
---
huh, it almost feels like the point of them is to get the raid specific armor from them and not legendarys.
---
Google. Sorry for being so vague, but I had the same problem a while back, and found the solution with Google. Just don't remember what is was :(

F- face dropping

We did it, just like we always would.  Even if we didn't.  Thanks, Todd, we love you.
---
this seems like one of those computer generated things can't remember what its called
---
Yes, seriously. They keep making the playlists more and more specific. It doesn't all have to be about radiation. We play these games for hundreds of hours, a one hour music loop is not enough.
---
If they really can't afford more music, then make radio stations that play the holotape stories. They've already been recorded.
---
You should go to sleep, or use a doctor‚Äôs bag. Nothin‚Äô worse than the ol‚Äô [crippled](https://imgur.com/a/TNDK6UL) head.

that's quite expensive for just a quad assaultron head, though.
---
There's a YouTube channel called Old World Radio 2 that has a few Fallout-themed radio streams. I've been considering putting it on my phone while I play.
---
Try top of the world.  Resin and the station bot can both have it.
---
Oh must have missed it when it first came round then.

You can speed up the respawn if you pick up enough items. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/edit

Right o will do cheers.

Yeah, not about to spend the scant remainder of my life on that. Have fun though!

Those challenges are such a pain the first time, and awful the fifth.

Ooh, she clearly needs to spend $18 on some skins.  Get those recurrent spending wallets out!
---
You need a dozen bowls of soup.
---
While I want to see some BOS stuff too, I also want some more time to save atoms.
---
Here on Xbox I normally see them for 7,000 to 10,000
---
My 5th character is a raider, although they won't ever actually bother any real people because that's just being a dick. I am considering breaking a few floating camps, but probably won't.
---
It's a bit difficult to worry about eating when there's a corpse purifying in your kitchen, ya know?
---
I worked really hard on that, please don't
---
What bothered me about that DLC was that if we never built any settlements up, then there would be almost no settlements to raid. The only option I worked out was to build them all into big farms before turning into a raider.
---
Hahaha AGAIN?!
---
OMG LOOOOOOOOL. Bruh
---
It's definitely good.  Would like one myself.
---
No also why the fuck would you use scrip 2 days before the 50% off sale
---
Very true.
---
Has anyone even used a scrap kit yet?
---
aLl haNdS oN dECk fOr wAsTlanDeRs
---
Well supposedly one of the outfits being added is a orange suit with bat patterns all over it (like the Festive Suit)
---
So I'm pretty sure it's safe to say the outfits here are gonna be new
---
Been waiting for a BoS bundle since the beginning, after almost a year the patience is running thin
---
The end is goddamn hilarious lol! That's well done. very impressive
---
Hope so!
---
That‚Äôs nothing. I‚Äôve seen random 3* weapons at 17k+, with about 20 other weapons in the vendor following the same trend. It‚Äôs insane, and few people on pc have their mic audio set to near instead of team so I can‚Äôt tell them. Poor guys probably never sell anything. Meanwhile I‚Äôm selling some TSE weapons for 2,500.
---
Oh man, it took me forever to get it from the bot so I feel your pain. =D
---
F
---
Could not EFFING believe it was still bugged. Why even post it, then? UGH! üôÑ
---
Its still got its issues but you'd be immune to what I'm thinking of just minding the store. 
---
I do wonder how you keep it stocked tho...
---
Been getting targeted due to some beef the clan i Was in (has been disbanded).  Literally had Nothing to do with the ordeal still being targeted by a group of individuals.
---
What would responders items be exactly? like hospital beds and stuff?
---
You can't just pop the battery pack out of your controller and pop it back in? That works for me.
---
Save up treasure maps. I got alot of my trapper and raider armor mods this way.
---
Don't want to be that guy but I have got a I5-9600k and an RTX 2070 and I cannot see any pop-in and the lights are pretty good IMHO, everything on Ultra, no stuttering whatsoever aside from the central zone in Whitespring.
---
I am not entirely sure what do you mean by "it doesn't even look that good". What does it look good then?
---
On a side note, if you ever fiddled with the ini file you might have screwd up something with shadows like it once happened to me, had to delete the ini and let the game generate a new one, and everything was fixed.
---
You have a Zealot's Explosive weapon that does not work properly?
---
I'm going to guess that English is not your first language. Can you post the issue in your language?
---
B I G  I R O N
---
Yeah. My character is level ~250 and still learning the occasional armor mod. It is by design, but the reasoning is unknown to people outside the studio.
---
Well done for them still not giving us Halloween decor.
---
I just want you to be amazed at how many quests I can fit on my screen!
---
Everyone and then when uranium fever pops up I‚Äôll take a break. I sell lots of legendaries but my plans are what sell the quickest.  But I have tons of em so I always have something to trade
---
Todd bless us, every one.
---
The stairs are almost identical to the standard just sheeted metal. Better off just saving for something else anyways in my opinion.
---
Well done everyone ‚ô° I did try but am having mental health issues irl so this affected me more than usual... I logged in for the first time in a while, went to a train station, spoke to the vendor... And some douchebag bashed and attacked me until it pushed me out of the vendor. I was there for maybe 10 sec before they did that. It really upset me and I haven't played since.
---
FB is easily one of the worst places on the Internet. I stopped using it a while ago, might be time to delete the account and be done with it, especially with the recent... political developments.

I do it all the time, rushing to get to the next camp for a bargain I sometimes accidentally click on the players name. instead.Then if they accept and I then I leave, I always feel bad and think they think I‚Äôve done that to get a free ride.  If they‚Äôre coming to your camp to spend caps they can afford to travel there.
---
I always feel awkward as fuck whenever there's a weekly Atom challenge to complete quests/events in a group, because I always just send team invites to randos until someone finally picks up. Then I proceed to never acknowledge them and claim a fuckton of workshops, because that's the quickest way to knock out quests and events.
---
I promise I keep my journal as light as possible to keep it off your HUD. And I share some decent convenience perk that I assume you don't already have active, like Good With Salt or something.
---
What is this ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù? Sometimes I hear old people talking about it but can‚Äôt really understand what they are saying.
---
That was cool of you. These interactions are why I love this game. Making newbies feel welcome is one of the best ways to keep new players in the game.
---
Got 3 today! Ironically I'm getting decent *** drops I don't want to scrap... 2 handmades, a Gatling, 2 levers, and a mg-42 all went to stash instead of trash.
---
\&gt;&gt; The arms also let you mine more ore, 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
This is inaccurate.
---
I've tested this twice personally, It's the Torso that provides the Ore bonus not the arms (Which is what the description says) and to get the carry weight bonus you need the FULL suit, swapping out even just the Helmet removes the carry weight bonus
---
No I'm on PC.  Ryzen 5.
---
They already did. Following the Roadmap it should already be here, including the legendary perk system
---
Hey there. Mics can be very useful when exchanging services with people and when off on the prowl like I unexpectedly became. With the US vs. AUS time difference being so great it's tricky to align meet-ups. I see mostly NZ, Japanese and oddly so few Aussies on the servers I join. If you see my camp, drop by one day!
---
Thanks
---
Great I'll hit you up when were both on
---
You got ripped off. He got 2,500 caps and you get to be disappointed with your weapon.
---
Oh jeez!
---
Typically when you don't get loot it means you are not doing enough damage.
---
 Turn on "show damage numbers" in the settings to see you what you are doing per hit. 
---
 Queen has a crazy high resistance to explosives, so that TSE that was wrecking months ago is now bearly tickling her.
---
Bear claw is there.
---
When I was leveling and not doing a lot of damage I wouldn't get drops because I wasn't doing a lot. Hows your damage?
---
Do u have a mic aswell
---
I think the weapon is really fun
---
Capture workshop build fortress and wait for raiders to show up
---
Also have a pretty high resistance to energy weapons. For a gatling laser it's not a problem due to so many shots per core... But my commando laser rifle only holds 21 cells and if spotted can get numbers like 11 damage.
---
If a few players comes in bloodied meat hook they can end it so fast you're not able to do the required min damage.
---
I made a few prime weapons just in case and it's good again.
---
I agree with everything, but they need to change something with the rewards - only Dead in the water gives you guaranteed 3\* legendary at the end (my friend get QE hunting rifle and BE handmade with 2 of our runs), which also isn't spectacular, but at least it's some kind of reward for all the resources you'll use. But the Meltdown is shit - finding 50 ID cards, easy to fail last phase and no legendary rewards sucks...
---
Honestly I just send off team requests when I have an atomic quest that needs to be finished with a team.
---
Ultra is for screenshots. This game chugs. If you want to make it run better, lower the settings. Do you actually enjoy depth of field and motion blur? I hated them and turned it off. Disabling grass creation is another huge framerate boost. Check nexusmods for custom ini tweaks for improved performance.
---
I have actually encountered this quite a few times lately; players holding back so everyone can get their shots in.
---
Which is awfully nice of them if you ask me because in all instances it was their group that launched the nuke in the first place.
---
There is something... endearing about people who treat me like a guest and not like a parasite.
---
Yeah bobbleheads should not take up camp budget
---
Complain to support and they will give you the missing atoms. I'm 100 atoms down this week so far with auto-completed challenges and ones that flat out don't work.
---
&gt; have you made a bug post about it yet?
---
I have not - My first test (no video) was about 4-5 months.
---
It's such a minor thing and being that people tend you use for the carry weight, which you need the full suit for....
---
One of the main factions we've seen in trailers are the Raiders, though, and we've had loads of their equipment in the shop.
---
That's the coolest thing ever dude!
---
Raiders rule!
---
Removed the App from my phone about 3 weeks ago for my mental health.  I maybe now check it once a week on my laptop.
---
I don't feel like I've "lost out"
---
I made a mixed match suit for someone once with the arms in mind. and have seen one or two people asking for just the arms for the mining. so you may want to make a bug report. since you have the vid made anyway.
---
Newbies, huh!? Don't trust them! Yesterday I helped with Whitesprings grinding to three of low-levels with German-sounding nicknames. When we get to bunker entrance we met three SB. I took care of the beasts when they were pooping at them with their .38's. When I finished - with the hairline of health - one of them hs me and took my paper bag with some good stuff in it. Then they disappeared. I said - never again trust low-level ones!
---
There was no way you were selling something as bad as TS, even with explosive, for 25k. So good on you for selling a decent chunk cheaper than what it's worth!
---
done
---
Twitter is even worse honestly
---
If I were you I‚Äôd save those caps and do some enclave events,they reward urban armor.Unless you want that legendary,then go for it.
---
FFS. Phil the lone QA guy has enough on his plate. Give the guy a break. /s
---
Looks great!
---
Make it like the Brahmin so you build a trough/nest and can repair it when damaged. I server hoped for about 4 or 5 hours to get a good sloth, then logged in a few days later just to watch him keep over for no reason.
---
I only want lag part to be made easier üòÖ
---
Goodneighbor vibes
---
Because they can't allow to much information on one server at a time, due to them renting the hamster powered analog servers off Amazon.
---
Dead in the water is easy if you convince your team to use any explosive shotguns with enforcer and keep ghouls cripple but alive (you can kill legendary ones after you finish closing geck).
---
There are 4 ways to get badges:
---
* doing challenges in World section (most time consuming and difficult)
---
* doing daily quest Stings and Wings near Dolly Sods in The Mire
---
* doing daily quest Operation Tidy near Kiddie Cabin in the Toxic Valley
---
* doing Public Event Campfire tales near Camp Adams in the Forest.
---
First is obviously the least advised, since it require a lot of traveling, resources and sometimes require rare plans to complete. Second and third are the easiest to do, take few minutes if you know what to do and where are bugs' parts. After last patch when they've included Campfire Tales to the public events, it's spawns on map very rarely. Last 3 quests have 25% chance to award badge upon successful finish, but it's not visible instantly (need to check pip-boy menu). Doing only those last three I was able to farm 20 badges on one character and 12 on second since last patch.
---
It seems that the user who answered this for me yesterday and clarified has deleted his comment but to paraphrase - 'As there is no functionally for a mod to have a skin on it's own, it \`functionally\` acts in game as it's own mod, requiring flux etc to craft etc (and you don't need to even learn the jet pack plan to use it so it's even a little pay-to-win in that respect). 
---
Also, when it was originally released it applied to Ultracite PA which, at the time, didn't have a jetpack  (and I \*think\* even allowed you to place it on limbs and not just the chest but I don't/didn't have it so I can't confirm). Hence all the confusion and my question :)
---
tldr; It's listed as a 'skin' but due to game restrictions functions in game as a mod and (currently) applies to all PA \*except\* the excavator PA. 
---
Hope that clears it up :)
---
ps. There is a lot of mis/outdated info on here (LOTS of people make assumptions without actually knowing and the game is under active development) so I don't think asking this (or any) question again is really that bad with the game in it's current state. The real issue is that the in game descriptions are not clear (and the patch notes when we get them) are incomplete and in some cases, just plain incorrect.
---
Agreed, have to double check on that full set bonus.
---
You obviously mistaken the quests - Dead in the Water is the first in rotation, one that you need to kill Strangler Heart. One with radioactive GECK is Meltdown, second in rotation (was last week). Now we have Washout.
---
Yeah! That bug is a good one!
---
Because without a cap, game like this will be filled with those players who place 3,000 bobbleheads for no reasons and dont care if it crashes the server.
---
Yeah, almost like some sort of movable camp. With workbenches and everything. Would be great!
---
Alright! please, i know i probly missing the point again where it is eventually all about,  its just i dont get whats so special about the fixer plan a lot seems fix on!                                                                                                i am just curious because i just play randomly events, not really going for that one special reward, eventually i cant avoid that its time for some.........orgenizing bleh! so stash.. Backpack turned inside out, ..... The fixer plan, well well well. Gonna try out myself then what it is thats so special it! Crafted a lot of fixer's with different tuning and moding, beside the effect that it makes you sneak better erc etc i still dont get my head around why people are fixed on fixing the f fixer plan! And ask/pay ridicilous lots of caps for it!
---
I understajnd where you are coming from but banning strangler armor isnt the right step, punishing  grindy v94 players is wrong. Fix the armor particles lag or just remove the particles to fix this all together, you dont need these green particlesas they are just show off.
---
Added, dextrouspick539
---
Thankyou, will be in in a couple of hours if you want to hang out :)
---
I hope to complete Encryptid and hopefully get the fixer plan at some point, I see some nice legendary fixers for sale. It would be nice, it may only be a 1*, but I love my bloodied combat rifle though.
---
I am also a member of a few facebook fallout 76 pages, seen this sort of behavior myself. Facebook is very toxic these days...
---
You only needed to complete collecting like 5 different resorces though, not all of them
---
I had no idea how lucky I was to get them before they shot up in price! Anyway enjoy your bloodied combat rifle, she‚Äôs a beaut!
---
is this sale going to be in the atom shop or in the legendary vendor i haven't met yet
---
If you play on Ps4 I‚Äôd love to check out your store sometime!
---
What do they even do?
---
That quest made me laugh so much too haha.
---
That's glorious. Close your shop if you want to keep it longer.
---
Jesus we need a companion app.
---
I know Beths wants us to turn on a PC and hopefully play the game but shop shit should be easy on a phone.
---
I think scraping, crafting should be on our phone.
---
Alright. I‚Äôm off and about to hop on here in a little bit. I don‚Äôt have a working mic right now so I hope that‚Äôs not gonna be a problem. What‚Äôs your PSN
---
This is an overly complicated idea just to make characters "fresh" for like 10 hours. Probably has a better shot by actually balancing things and fixing exploits.
---
Bobbleheads must occupy camp budget, but it should be distributed in terms of item size. To display a bobblehead i need to scrap, for example, a table. It's ridiculous. If scrap a table or a couch it should let allow to display at least 3 bobbleheads, or i'll emptying the camp just to display bobbleheads.
---
And that's how it's done. welcome to the wasteland folks.
---
Plant Corn,muitfruit and Tato‚Äôs
---
This makes corn starch that scraps to adhesive, never run out ever again üôåüèº
---
It‚Äôs be handy to have a guide for weapon prices. 
---
I wish there was a global auction house that‚Äôs the fairest way.
---
No problem on the mic, PSN JamieDevito.  I'll join your world, fast travel to you, team up and I'll plop it down, once it's down, you can move it, store it, whatever you want.
---
Dang and I'm in the hospital rn getting surgery on my spine tomorrow.. There is no way I can grab that :-(
---
It‚Äôs because the Main Quest is fast travel fetch quest simulator.
---
Literally just did Early warnings and all I was doing was fast travelling around for 40-50 caps at times Capitol building to Abbie‚Äôs bunker.
---
Why would you put a cap barrier in front of playing the fucking game???
---
I wasn‚Äôt keeping track but I‚Äôm 80% sure I didn‚Äôt even break even with caps.
---
Maybe if I sold my reward which is bonkers.
---
Ok for the first one just use ballistic heavy guns if all 4 people will use them heart will melt.
---
I kinda want Bethesda to give us the caps whenever someone fts to our camps.
---
But it takes both camp budget and stash space... This is really stupid...
---
so what did it gave you? lol
---
Where have I wrote anything about problems with killing SH? Seems like you don't read my posts and just randomly write something...
---
What‚Äôs the fixer plan?
---
Are you suggesting I murder fluffy in cold blood?
---
I can't even...
---
üòú
---
Its situations like yours and people on business trips and stuff that make me wish they'd develope an app that allows up to access and use the atomic shop from our phone. Other stuff too like pipboy acsess and stuff would be cool but mainly just using the atomic shop. Sorry man
---
In this case i have no idea what can be the problem with the only mission that can be solo on expert
---
i got the 3 codes and no atoms.
---
Almosy zero. Mine died and i don't see a different in budget.
---
Yeah cause this subreddit is one of the most wholesome places ever
---
I found one of those and just dropped it on the ground - is it rare?  Damn!  That was last night!
---
Damn lol I just replied to another guy about this. Itd be great!
---
I play quite casually solo, so for me Instigating on weapons.
---
Currently looking to build Unyeilding and Zealots armours set though (Already have Slayer, Troubleshooter and a full Chameleon sets for the respective characters)
---
Exactly it's broken for me too its frustrating some of my normal challenges are broken too so i lost lost a lot of Atoms already.
---
I wasn't writing about Dead in the water, I was writing about Meltdown, which is dull (collecting 50 cards) and impossible to do solo on expert (due to the GECK fight). And I was writing about lame rewards for Meltdown and Washout. Read carefully please before commenting...
---
murder is such a strong word, I was think more in the lines off offering or ok ok yes  i was thinking murder. I know I would had killed him just to get a 3* rolling pin or drill lmao.
---
why not just make it so that only one bobblehead stand can be placed?
---
This is correct. If you cannot do standard for at least a plan ,there is no point hoarding steel.  The hoarding would also take forever. With a team you would do standard +novice in the time it takes you to solo novice.
---
The current way bulking works is it halves the weight of lead and aluminum. I would be FINE with bulking if it stayed at half the weight but applied to everything you can bulk
---
Try displaying every single mag and bobblehead and then complain about camp budget. Bethesda isn't going to increase camp budget anytime soon so figure out a way to work around it. 4 foundations or 4 walls or 4 crops or a 4 combo of the above use approx 1% of camp budget and 1 roof piece uses 1% camp budget, keep that in mind and get creative with your builds. I use defence fencing instead of walls and I build up instead of out and I still have enough camp budget left over that equals a turrant (turrent?) Space.
---
add me too on psn with 'fo76' in request pls 
---
Owl_No
---
I don't use any TSE, I just use an anti-amror .50 cal machinegun
---
Sadly not much with me gun but, when she lands I can get some 60 - 100's hits win my melee in.
---
Which normal challenges are broken for you this week?
---
What's the min damg needed though ? Anyone know.
---
I think it‚Äôs less of object size and more if the object type and its effects on a server. It‚Äôs all in the coding.
---
Chalenges like the one you need to register the schorchbeast queen kill, the one to power up a power plant for the scouts and tons of others i don't think they will ever fix those. This week for me the launch code the op is mentioning is the only one broken so far i hope they don't mess the dailies too.
---
I hope they mark pets as essential as well. Tired of people coming to my camp and shooting my pet deathclaw cause they see a red healthbar. Despite it having my name beside it. Like, shes not gonna do anything to you.
---
They should do a thing where you pay a certain amount of caps a day and everyone can free fast  travel to your camp.
---
While I can't wait for the (optimistically hopeful) upcoming Halloween items, I and a few of the people I play with have taken to building our own haunted houses, using atom shop and in game stuff. I've even incorporated an indoor "corn maze" naturally into mine. If you're on X1 you should come by and check it out some time, might give you some inspiration.
---
I often wander why we pay caps for FT and not just get increased hunger and thirst. Where are these caps going to? Just breaks immersion and restricts exploring.
---
Awesome, well done.
---
Good idea. Sadly if we get this it will be in the Atomic Shop...
---
1000.
---
I don‚Äôt like or play fortnite but really enjoy the nuclear winter game mode. I have 553 hours in adventure mode and like that I can mix it up and play a few matches each week in NW for some added tension and excitement. Both game modes can exist and it‚Äôs clear adventure is the focus. NW was just something fun they released over the summer.
---
or dont die
---
I went from Ranger uniform and hat to the clean versions of both with the black shovel backpack to western outfit with chaps and a black cowboy hat. 
---
Now I have dropped back into my responders paramedic jumpsuit
---
I‚Äôm still looking for that great instigating sniper.
---
Am I right in saying that we can apply legendary perks to the fixer?!
---
Just a AA 50 Cal :), I would of thought that is more than capable of getting the damage you need, perhaps your perks need tweaking to get the most out of the gun?
---
Or dont be a fucking prick
---
Yes
---
It's still there !
---
6 days left.
---
Perfect, thank you!
---
More like 8-Track tapes.
---
PA earned from Quests (Raider, Ultracite, others?) is placed whole into your inventory.
---
When you drop those specific ones (not place), they show up as a bag, instead of a completed frame.
---
Don't mention it :)
---
Xbox - I MIGHT still have a 3\* LAR
---
That's the story of Ford. He blew himself up with some kind of explosive device.
---
Strangely I'm only get like 2 damg per hit on her. Idk, I may just  get a gun specifically for her, one with a prime receiver.
---
It was only listed at that price to advertise its existence because the OP didn't have a price in mind yet.
---
First place: Anti armor and Bloodied :) plus explosive for the maximum pleasure.  
---
Second place: Two shots and Executioner  
---
Third place: Junkies
---
I think as long as adventure is the main focus it's probably not that bad. 
---
I think the game would really benefit from adding challenging end game dungeons and bosses. For all intents and purposes 76 is more of an mmo now, than a singleplayer rpg, and that's fine. There's something alluring about having really difficult end game content, even if only 10-15% of the player base can clear it, it gives most players something to strive towards. If that end game content could have cool questing and lore tied to it, it would be even better.
---
PSA: you can protect other people's bags by crouching on top of them. It'll block other people's cursors.
---
Anti-Armour all day.
---
 I play a pretty casual sneaky rifleman build. Though, I do like my Instigating Dragon and LAR...but I tend to use my AA rifles more often, AAE hunting, Submachine gun, Gatling Gun and Lever Action.  AA Gauss, Handmade(x2), 10mm pistol and SMG, Railway, M79,   Ultracite Gatling Laser and Ultracite Laser Rifle. All of them 3\* weapons with varying effects.
---
Currently trying to collect an AAE variant of every weapon I use...
---
r/ThanksImCured
---
Interesting idea my man especially power/luxury dilemma part but for example I carry a W fat man (just 2 pounds) and its the only reason I carry it and sling some nukes if i come across them; so yeah its not about power but it 100% effects if I use the weapon or not. A solution i had in mind to remove some affixes from some weapon types - heavy guns sure could use a FIXED (weightless doesn't apply to goddamn mods) weightless affix while pistols don't need to?
---
Yes, but much more durable, since it uses a crystal based material and is read via laser. They can hold up to 4 terabytes of data.
---
Dude i came across a guy just next to WS TS, his camp was just a cooking pot on top of one floor with the letters "cook for narnia" and after i did, i was in an underground camp! So cool!
---
Maybe he had a cooking pot somewhere too?
---
UwU
---
Just to play devils advocate, and assume that the OP has triggered some 0.01% chance encounter but didn't know how to take screenshots, I suppose starting a thread because you were so blown away only to be instantly labelled a lair or a troll isn't exactly going to encourage engagement now is it?
---
Think it is just an old camp its happened to me a couple times yesterday. Also check grafton vender for the plans i got my combat armour and deep pockets there and i think it had plans for all light armours and the mod por pockets and deep pockets
---
Or just, plug it into the console with a USB charge cord?
---
&gt; I think the game would really benefit from adding challenging end game dungeons and bosses.
---
This!
---
I played daily for a few months, loving every second. Hit level 76 and realized I'd spent literally, an entire month doing the exact same routine every day. 
---
Log in, make my supply run for screws and then go hunt for Legends. 
---
A whole month of nothing but that routine and I still hadn't found a decent (usuable) legendary.
---
I gave up. I was still wanting to play but just had nothing to do. The endless grind simply isn't fun for me. I moved on to Witcher 3.
---
I stay subbed here for updates and will pop in when Wastelanders hits but otherwise I've done it all.
---
I disagree with it, I only want them to fix how it works - it's useless affix for highly modifiable weapons, since weight reduction doesn't apply for mods, only for basic weapon. So the difference between 90WR and 'normal' Hunting Rifle, Gatling Laser or Handmade is meaningless as those weapons needs to be modified to be useful.
---
Why do you need Fixer plans? It is not obtainable from Purveyor unless you learn the plans? Im clueless how this connects...
---
I read somewhere on here yesterday, that its not taken by a player but glitched when you die with it on you its disappears but if you store it and pick it back up it dosnt unless someone takes it but once you stashed it why would you take it out the stash.
---
You are wasting ammo with the 50 cal when you shoot the SBQ in air. Let her land and shoot her in the face. A full mag should put you over the minimum damage required for loot. (I get 22 dmg/second headshots with my AAFFR .50 Cal, 55% Heavy Gunner, 5% Bloody mess, Stabilized 3.)
---
Any1 with Fixer plans on PC? Ready to pay 15k caps.
---
I looked around that area for a good bit, and didn't see any kind of evidence of a camp, just the marker on the map. There could've been a cooking pot there in the bushes somewhere. The map marker pointed directly to a huge tree, maybe the player was a squirrel.
---
How do you get the dailys to pop up?
---
You go there and speak to robots.
---
Well I just tried that and it didn't do anything :c
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll check in Grafton for that when I get back in the game.
---
It's always a delay with it, but since two last patches I don't have a problem with triggering dailies. You can even go to you Terminal computer in the CAMP and check if robots are ready to meet.
---
Na... OP‚Äôs post history is trash.
---
Be so cool of there was shared towns. Like everyplayer on the server gets a small plot next to each other to build a shop/house
---
totally agree.
---
Damage threshold not met. The thing is though, no one really know \*what\* the threshold actually is. I can hit her just fine with my AAE Gatling Gun at 4 per shot (with a few heavy gunner perks). I used my main build (rifleman) and I couldn't do enough damage with my  AAE LAR or AAE hunting rifle or even my AA Gauss before she died. I might've hit it if I had gone with the Gauss first, as it's the hardest hitting.
---
But, soon that won't matter, when they drop the Event loot change.
---
And use a WIRED connection? What are we!? Cavemen!? :p
---
You dont lose your flux if you die after the event ends, the game eats it. It's been this way for at least 3 or 4 months now.
---
Seven.
---
Yeah, you get an unlegendary version of it during the Lying Lowe DLC quest, and the Encryptid event has a chance to drop the plans, which gives you the possibility to get the gun through Legendary vendor
---
Yeah, Fallout tech lore is weird like that. Simultaneously more advanced and less advanced than out timeline, not accounting for the year difference.More advanced robotics and portable nuclear fusion power.  However they just recently invented integrated circuits and their display technology is only just moving away from cathode-ray tube past the year 2000.
---
How does the damage stack on an assaultron head anyways? does quadruple ammo capacity equal 4x damage per shot? (if you reload to max)
---
I love hitting them before they move and watch them occasionally ragdoll into the air for no reason.
---
Oooh, I hadn't even logged in in awhile. I really though it was millions of scorchbeasts, and they were going to be spawning everywhere in great numbers, so I didn't bother because they're scary..
---
Fever also needs to be raised to max level as well.  Difficulty wise, level 35-42 is not much different from 45-62 for mobs with the people that the event attracts.
---
People have been using the Bass to glitch their camps underground... Maybe that?
---
They just started adding raids, first one came out a couple months ago. It is challenging for most users. Some people have reported lag, I haven‚Äôt had much and find it fun. I doesn‚Äôt have any complex boss battles but i like it.
---
I noticed the perimeter wall platforms (or whatever they're called) are bugged and take up a deceptively small amount of budget until you log off. Wouldn't surprise me if the same issue applies to other items as well.
---
All hail the Mighty Mothman
---
Tanagra town, go up into cave and you get 40 acid per server hop
---
It's not other players. It magically turns to vapor as the poster here said.
---
Sucks but as a few have said, for a few months now you lost it if you die.
---
the Queen, I think you have to get the final hit on it...but it could be bugged. I finally ticked off the Legendary Deathclaw one the other day during a queen fight and one had spawned...but I don't recall getting the last hit or not..
---
Sadly I couldn't be a part of it ‚òπÔ∏è
---
never said something about duping.....   
---
You are like the guys who take  a workshop and then are surprised that they get into PVP-Fights.  
---
People start to read god dam it!!!
---
Quad explosive is my go to right now. The harpoon gun is so much fun. This was the first item to pull me away from my bloodied
---
People who have that many quests tracked are sociopaths.
---
Also, the "Kill 5 Radscorpions in the Savage Divide" challenge can go die in a nuke zone. That jsut encourages server hopping to get it done, when they're so uncommon of a spawn. I know two places...Middle Mountain Cabins and Freak Show. Server hopped for 45  minutes and not a single radscorpion to kill. The one instance I did find them, they were already dead.
---
Love this. Good luck on your studies!
---
It's good that you got a positive first impression. Even more impressive that you seem to have such a complete understanding of it after a day and I'm still  getting my head around this crazy sandbox after 1200 hrs.

Can someone link to these bloodied swing buds that do so much damage please? I've got the god roll ss bloodied meat hook but I can't do these massive kill her fast numbers and I'm level 354. With my be 50 I typically get 100 to 150 actual registered damage per shot when I have all the Pistons firing. The 50 is my go to but I'd love to try swing on her
---
you did good, Sir. :)
---
Lag: your solution for this mess is waste more time server hoping? No, thanks.
---
Can't complete solo: i remember Todd saying this game could be done either with friends or solo, so everything in the game should be achievable either way as well.  There's a Lone Wanderer perk card, right?
---
Too hard: I agree. If you're going to a high level event at level 30 you're gonna have a bad time. Save it for later. Other than that vault 94 raid mission is just stupid boring level design. 
---
"To the people who want it made easier, fuck off", no need to be an ass. There's room for everyone in this game. ;)
---
Ah ok, I wasn‚Äôt aware of that
---
Social media is trash.
---
The problem with that is not the event itself, it's the Mole Miners's level as a species that's capped at 40~. I don't know if they can up the miner's levels just for the event, and I doubt they'd rise it for all miners.
---
Any chance it might somehow be related with duping, RMT and using 3rd party dlls infected with keylogger..?
---
I'm still hoping too. It's too frustrating and depressing to keep looking for new pets now. :(
---
for me is it a power if i could wear 10times more weapons then before  
---
On the other hand i dont want more lags cause of people running around with 100 of weapons on their char!  
---
do you memberries the weight bug where the server started to lag if someone was in a radius of 100 meters?
---
THANK YOU!
---
Awesome!! One of the best I've seen yet
---
Yes I have a mic, i live in eastern standard time USA.
---
You could explore on foot and I think the caps for FT encourage that Imho.
---
That's really nice of you! I bought mine for 14k lol.
---
I know I don't qualify as an expert in the end game stuff, but I've seen players literally being able almost one shot the most dangerous creatures in the game. The end game bosses should be difficult even for well geared players.
---
That being said, the game has a really good foundation to build on: I absolutely adore the world map they've created. I haven't felt such an urge to explore since the early wow days or oblivion when it first came out. I also like the building and survival aspects.
---
Yo not a big deal tbh I think the items will return. And if not it's like it is. Thank you for your kind words man :-) an app would be wonderful! Not just for the shop but also to keep track of collectibles like magazines and bubble heads.
---
That was awesome of you man. Helping out others in the game makes it even more enjoyable.
---
Some one sold me the legendary gatling plasma for $1000 caps when they originally wanted $10K for it. Man did that put a smile on my face
---
It definitely feels like more than just a visual bug; I find myself having to top up every few minutes
---
You need to be &gt;80% to get the well fed/hydrated benefits; maybe this being lowered to &gt;75% would help, and the overall reduction being reduced a little.
---
:(
---
Even if it is related to all that we still should have 2FA available.
---
Yes, more often than not when something like this happens is user error but social engineering is a thing and no one is immune to it.
---
Even if you consider yourself 'walking on the right side of the law' (so to speak) you are still not immune to it. Everyone is fallible and not having 2FA makes the consequences of one's failings... very steep indeed.
---
I mean they added a whole new map, all the guns are retextured, they added way more ambiance, some QOL changes, lots of other meat features, improved graphics and lighting and removed most of the old weapons, mobility and meds so they cam start from scratch. 
---
It practically is a whole new game.
---
First get 1000 scrip ... Then focus on stash clear out. ... Feels more like a job than a game some times.
---
I‚Äôm level 46 too we gotta grind
---
2FA is coming soon they said
---
That's an awesome work, i love housing a lot and i love what you did, it's a shame i'm on pc and cannot see it :(
---
I wish they will give us more npc to make our camps alives, but i think too much will impact a lot on server stability so i'm happy with collectron and brahmin for the moment :D
---
I've seen that too. More often than not which is really troublesome. I tried to buy a legendary fixer off one guy.... Had it listed for 23K caps, I offered him 5. He got pissy saying I wasn't a true fan and didn't know proper value, blah blah blah.... Ok bud have fun not selling your overpriced stuff, see ya!
---
How much of a delay are we talking here? If you don't mind me asking.
---
My heavy gunner has at least 1, if not 2 versions of every heavy gun. Scripping stuff makes me sweat every time. I have changed the names of everything but have too many to favorite. I have a weapon hording problem lol
---
Pretty sure there's no upper limit on swing speed. I had a cultist dagger that's very fast by default with swing speed and martial artist and it was *stupid* fast.
---
Video is killing me :D
---
I *think* some forest ones might not be. At least I've run into it before.
---
What? Are you kidding me? Plain text?
---
That's such late 1990's thing to have passwords in plain text anywhere.
---
I'm disappointed with my AAE 50 pretty much everywhere. On paper it looks badass. In actual use, not so much. I get noticeably more damage with just a BE handmade.
---
Something that even Ray Charles could‚Äôve seen was doomed to failure without a faction system or role playing tools of any substance, alas.
---
You could try some high level enemy spawn locations. Try west tek, whitesprings, Charleston capital, dryer chemical, fort defiance and harpers ferry.
---
I personally don't do it but I also realise it's fair game. It's a little much to ask people not to do it.
---
I mean it sucks for you but that's the price you pay for dying. Otherwise there's zero penalty for dying at all.
---
Random encounter with the Pied Piperbot.
---
Do not cross him or he will take your children!
---
I tried admiring until some random came up and killed them all
---
AA all day!  Man nothing beats it
---
How long did cultists last?
---
Thank you
---
From the moment I click 'E' on robot to splash screen with "quest started' sometimes it takes up to 30 seconds.
---
It's weird I always hear this and never see any legendaries in these places, except harpers it's always good to me. But instead I run across dozens in random places.
---
I had a workshop warrior kill me. I was sad so I just stayed down for a while. Until I noticed that he was shooting off all of my power armor. They need to change how that works. I shouldn‚Äôt be taking more damage while I‚Äôm dead.
---
In my greenhouse trophy room I've got 4 full magazine displays, 2 glass cabinet displays, 3 heavy weapon displays, and all the bobbleheads. This is in addition to the rest of my camp and I'm a terrible hoarder.  It can be done but sometimes tough choices have to be made. In my case, it was reducing the number of turrets and crops, and cleaning out my stash. Having said all that, yes, we need more camp budget!
---
Technically it's not stealing, but an game mechanic meant to punish players for dying (only one i might add). But sure, it's a dick move. Don't go to major events with shitload of scrap, empty your bags.
---
I am glad you had a good experience! Lately mine has all been not-so-good. They took away survival mode and now it seems like I have a permanent target on me and my home because I like my pretties. The last day of the scorched run the hubby and I stayed on after the kiddos logged off and we wished we had logged off too. Three butt-nuggets destroyed his camp and of course he popped shots back. I tried to help but everything froze while they were shooting these huge guns. They stopped to head to my house and we unfroze, dead. They took all the stuff we collected to use to help rebuild our youngest son's house [same thing happened to him] . When I got back they were trying to destroy my house so I pulled the plug. Tired of people being jerks. We got on another server and rebuilt and only logged on long enough to buy the new stuff. Think for the first time since beta I am going to give it a rest for a couple weeks. Maybe by then the griefers will be bored...or is that the reason they are doing it in the first place üòÜ
---
There is/should always be legendaries at white springs and Wes-tek.
---
\&gt;  got killed ... and a guy took the flux 
---
Nope, you die, you lose the flux.
---
Been like this since forever.
---
A keylogger isn't even needed. Passwords stay stored in plain text when you log in.
---
It‚Äôs all hit and miss. If there was a sure fire way to farm legendaries people would have found it by now. The only way is to hit up areas with a large amount of high level enemies. Harpers ferry and white springs are pretty decent and I can usually find at least one legendary enemy between the two.
---
You would be surprised. There is always someone that will pay. I will drop max caps in a sec if it's something I want because I know I'll make it back in a few days. I price high for items I don't really want to sell. My logic is it's in my stash anyway, no harm in throwing it out there. A few times people have dropped 25k and sent me a note saying it was a steal or I just got ripped off. Little do they know how many accounts and mules I have.
---
Load that sucker up to full capacity and watch stuff melt. I think it's one of the gems undervalued in the game. 2500 is a good price imo.
---
Yes it is. The people posting it's not just don't know
---
So where's the list?
---
Problem is, some of us can't escape, especially when we see anti-whatever group we're in messages appearing in our fantasy worlds.
---
Enjoy your privilege tho
---
Not gonna give to anyone beside beshsda support   has ign and password for 100's of ppl
---
Yeah, I meant program that reads passwords. Malware? Spyware? Trojan?
---
Same for the behemoth rock. I somehow got several in my stash.
---
What's the even loot change?
---
need more players like you, Sir. :)
---
Bravo sir .... Braaaavo
---
I‚Äôm looking for a squad to run the raids with too my tag is FrienofthedeviL
---
Will add you now
---
**I disagree. Here's what I said in another post for my reasoning, I used pistols and rifles as examples. Long story short you do need to make some sort of sacrifice to help keep balance, can't have it all.**
---
"It is absurd what rifles weigh. Don't get me wrong I completely understand where you re coming from but......
---
I think it's kinda fair....I mean they do need to have some sort of down side to using them...... In the essence of balance (may not be a popluar opinion). What else could you do? 
---
You could give Rifles the packing light perk and take it away from pistols. Than swap tank killer away from rifles and give it to pistols? I'm sure many folks would not care for that...... But it sure would help balance things out a bit. Rifles need weight reduction, pistols need armor pen and stagger.  That would be a fair trade wouldn't it? Can't ask for a buff and not give something up if you're already one of the best classes in the game.....
---
As of right now there aren't any other downsides to a rifle build other than them weighing a bunch. You could be in the same boat as pistols and have ok damage, a bunch of useless perks, and on top of that, have to either choose between stacking damage cards or taking sneak cards requiring you to sacrificing some of your main damage cards.....At least rifles can have damage all the damage perks, on top of all the sneak perks , armor pen, stagger, high cripple rate, crit just as much as pistols and while giving up nothing. So if weight is the biggest issue your having with your class/build you're doing pretty dang good."
---
This person gets it. Facebook is one of the most distractive forces in our society right now. It's opened channels for misinformation never seen before. Spread bs ideas as fact that directly hurt people, and driven the value of privacy into the ground. It's just bad
---
Has anyone tried getting the nuke codes via the quest from the whitesprings bunker terminal?
---
I thought about seeing if that would properly trigger the challenge completion.
---
This guy's likely hacking or more likely editing the game so he can do like half a million damage per shot. More damage you take, more damage done to your armor pieces. Do not pvp in this game. Or even better, do not play this game if competition is your thing. This game's got no protection when it comes to exploiting/hacking. Wanna report him for cheating? Good luck. He's not getting banned
---
Truth. What was ever said of any importance in 256 characters
---
Amen. While OP offers a reasonable work around, we shouldn't need it. Last time we tried 3 servers, each time 2 out of 4 couldn't get in. We all decided to play NW, lol.
---
It's a mix of perks, armor effects and chems to get real high numbers. Also have 14 to 15 star before any increases helps. My str usually sits at 22 - 24, almost constantly. The leather arms can give a boost to unarmed damg and with radicool + the typical damg/armor ignore perks. I know normal enemies I hit anywhere from 300~ish to like 600/700 ish and I'm not even fully perked/set up for it. I use the unstoppable monster weapon too.
---
I'll deffo take one. I'll need a long while to get the caps though :(
---
The alternative you're proposing is to ignore it and inconvenience everyone who's unfortunate enough to be at a public event and have their game repeatedly crash, nonetheless a public event that requires that recall keycard which is like 2000 caps.
---
What would those levers happen to be?
---
Lol yeah yeah. This may be true for you but not everyone.
---
You can't have a bloodied AAE. AA and Bloodied are both primary effects.
---
works a treat on ps4. 76 does something nasty with the controllers, so as an experiment, swapped to wired. No more stuttering, spinning, or disconnects. perhaps the same may be true for xbox ?
---
You're stuck with 800. Scrap all of your junk to make it weigh less and throw out all stuff that you really don't need. There's a base vendor machine in the game. The atom shop just has skins for the vendor.
---
Not agree with AA. With perks/stuff you have already anti-armor reaching almost the maximum AA cap. So most of the time add 50% is unecessary and others attributes are much more interesting.
---
Wait what?
---
That's not stupid. That's system limitation. Why do you even think camp budget and stash budget are even the same thing? 
---
If they charge you 30 dollar per month sub for 10x server capacity, you're gonna complain just as well. It's how the technology is.
---
My god man do some quests already.....
---
Yeah I keep a "long gamma" gun for that and it's does a good deal of damage.
---
Bethesda doesn‚Äôt have 2FA? I assume I‚Äôd used it once and it remembered my computer that‚Äôs lame.
---
Also very annoying that I can‚Äôt change my username (which is my full fucking name) because Bethesda didn‚Äôt make clear it would be shown to everyone.
---
This happened to me today, 5 months after your said that you were looking into it!
---
if you have the powerful automatic receiver, that's the best one in terms of raw damage with automatic fire. The next step would be the prime auto receiver
---
Great
---
Please also send it to have I been pwned (https://haveibeenpwned.com/) it‚Äôs a free service which integrates with loads of password managers, email providers etc and will email people who are listed in these dumps.
---
They also trace back to try and work out when and where the leak happened to inform people who aren‚Äôt on the list but maybe at risk.
---
Hopefully they already know about it but they do credit people who inform them (if you want credit) and that‚Äôs massively being a bro.
---
You should also include the imgur list of all those Winter Man masks, JE/BE GPs, SentAss armors, B25 Handmades and DE legacies, Ken. That might help your cause.
---
I made a thread about it. If you're on PC and log in using the fallout76 exe instead of the Bethesda launcher, your password will stay stored in plain text.
---
It's Bethesda's answer to 'We need higher daily scrip caps!'. It's gotten really difficult to reach 150 cap unless you are playing at least 3+ hours a day
---
Use a browser search, there are fallout wiki's with handmade rifle mods listed.
---
In game names or Bethesda account names? If it's the account name, would you be so kind as to check for one matching my user name here? I'd like to know if I need to immediately change my password.
---
"Safezone" has been around 500 damage for me.
---
I hate post like this,am surprised nobody knows about the disappearing flux
---
This is why i pay into thoes scrap kits and make shure i am packing atleast 30 stims to. Fight the queen. 1 i dont die. 2 i can scrap all after i collect from the queen. So everything stays safe.
---
You can change your display name so your login does not appear as your user name in the game.
---
You can - and IMO should - change this in your account settings in Beth.net
---
Jesus Christ. Glad I use a unique password but this is still shockingly poor.
---
Can you link me to the thread?
---
OP's interested in recreating the feeling of playing at launch. It's not able to be recreated, it was a once in a lifetime thing. Everyone milling around Flatwoods together was amazing. The first Collision Course event I did during the Beta was the most crowded with players I've ever done.
---
It sucks because it is hard to find legendaries I struggle against legendary reavers and I have decent legendaries
---
I did pick up quite a few so I can say it's obtainable legitimately.
---
I‚Äôm just gonna say that the fo76 community hasn‚Äôt been exactly kind towards criticisms either. I‚Äôm aware there is a difference between being critical and being an ass, but I‚Äôve seen both get equally blasted to hell here
---
Then the system itslef is stupid/bad/poorly designed... I have never been so frustrated by invetory or stash in game before...
---
It's on my profile, it's more or less the same thing as what I posted above. There's a static pointer to it in memory, very, very easily accessible for malicious programs.
---
i farmed some spawns quite heavily for a while and managed to only find 2 bos hoods over a period of two weeks so they are just very rare but i can confirm that you can find them out in the wild
---
At least it wasnt kill a megasloth in cranberry again... that one is an instant " fuck that shit " when I see it in the dailies...
---
Best I have ever seen by far
---
I‚Äôm talking about 17k for a troubleshooters +50% cripple bat. I‚Äôd drop a lot of caps on something I‚Äôd like to use as well but that‚Äôs crazy.
---
I got one in my display case, but I couldn't say where it's from or what quest rewarded it. It certainly was long after the BETA, though.
---
If you're on PC, I'd give it away for free.
---
You can change your display name on the Bethesda website so that people won't be able to see your account name.
---
November.
---
Hey op, tse lever actions can go for 7.5 k pretty easily
---
AAE Handmade with powerful automatic receiver is my fave (Commando build).
---
Daily challenges are pretty good when we can only complain about rare spawns. Remember how bad brewing challenges were, every day for weeks. Then camera came out and it was photo challenges for months. I'm glad they switched back to these easier ones
---
They said November. Im guessing after the new year.
---
Correct.
---
You need to have it learned.
---
Yeah, I thought it was only used for power armor. I was doing a power armor build until my character had 390 carry weight out of pa.
---
Awesome. That's perfect. Which quest are you grinding for scrip gear?
---
It is probably under the ground, ive seen tons of camps that do that and there's a camp there.
---
Why use @ instead of A?
---
Almost every location can spawn legendary enemies. 
---
Some locations more than others.
---
Yeah but it happens more often at higher levels right? I don‚Äôt see them very often and was just wondering places where they are more likely to spawn.
---
After losing so many pets I have given up. One day they'll fix it. It's one thing I live in hope for in this game.
---
Thanks I will ASAP.
---
Found one not a week ago in one of the two - that I know of - random headgear spawn locations in the Ranger District Office in the Cranberry Bog: The shelf of your left as you enter the locked room next to the toilet.
---
The other headgear random spawn in that location is in the 'autopsy room' with the cages and the dead beaver on the stretcher. I often find the welding mask and the flight helmet there.
---
If you have any doubt change your password
---
Cause I couldn't figure out why I was getting tags for spam I thought that could be one of the reasons
---
My game has been choppy as shit lately. But I did recently switch to five full pieces of weapon weight reduction and started carrying around my whole cache of weapons, which is over 30 3* Legendaries. So I kinda chalk it up to my inventory
---
Yeah but this case people were duping with a help of a dll that stole their passwords.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/diguhg/my_friends_account_was_hacked_and_several_other/
---
How about some Bluegrass - Man of Constant Sorrow.
---
It is happening more and more like you said. The two most important things to remember no matter how pissed you get are 1) Make sure your in Pacifist mode! 2) No matter how pissed you get, NEVER fight back. Then they can‚Äôt destroy you or your camp. It totally sucks that these turds think this is fun. Most are kids or grown ups with only kids mentality. They don‚Äôt have the intelligence to enjoy or understand the game at a higher brain matter level. Ignore them and let them waste the ammo, they‚Äôll go away.
---
Havemt seen any legendaries at whitespring in the past week and i play every day
---
I'm just happy we rarely see those cancerous conditional camera challenges anymore. I will never ask a random person in the server to wear a suit and clown hat and go to a fissure site to take one picture for 10 cents.
---
Never used it, but honestly it was because I read through the ToS you had to agree to that someone uploaded, saw a lot I didn't like, I decided not to make one. Plus on top of that some stalker chick from my high school had tried to ruin my social life by making a fake facebook in my name to ruin it after I refused to go out with her. When she started trying to pretend to be me online I had to send out a threat around my school that I would have one of my contacts find out the origin of who created the account and would be handing them over to the cops, given that what she was doing would've gotten her expelled from our High School and get in trouble with the law. In less than a day she took it down. Didn't even need to dig to find out it was her, the image of me she tried using was only ever taken on her flip phone. Damn crazy bitch...
---
I want a hammer drill!
---
That‚Äôs sucks.
---
If people intend on being script kiddies they need to at least have some basic common sense.
---
I emailed them and they changed mine. This was during the beta though so it may be different now.
---
Dude, we want to help you but not one of the people who have responded so far has any idea what you are talking about. Please post the issue in your native language and we will go from there.
---
I know I‚Äôm a little late, I‚Äôm sorry. However, some weapon and armor plans cannot be learned by scrapping. These plans, you will have to purchase or find as quest rewards or out in the wild.
---
I played just an hour ago. Seen two 3 stars, both dropped 1 star crap tho.
---
Reference points +1000
---
There isn't an official date yet but I'd bet around Christmas time.
---
not soon enough!!!!
---
Thanks a million!
---
The stash box at 800 is plenty. Scrap junk and bulk. Stash each 2 bulk, 20 unbulkable. Hardened mass, glowing mass, high radiation fluid as needed to craft stable flux or underarmors or sell them to robot vendors daily.
---
Shielded underarmor, dense chest and deep pocketed limbs shadowed combat armor. Unyielding is the best.
---
Ranged vats crit sneak rifleman commando build. Search for this build guide.
---
Avoid these mustations: Electrically charged, plague walker, and unstable isotope.
---
Backpack "order of the tadpole" quest
---
Mini backpack is free. Found at Morgantown airport.
---
True
---
Wait until you've found the endgame content. If you found it, let us know .)
---
Did you use different passwords for all five accounts? And I am super curious as to why you bought the game five times instead of twice (surely one extra is all you need for a mule if you have two PCs?)
---
Modus has them for sale.
---
The bunny placement is everything.
---
They say a lot. It shouldn't take them a year to implement 2FA.
---
What platforms is effected by this? I play on Xbox so I‚Äôm just wondering if I‚Äôm mostly safe from this sorry if it seems like a selfish question but I‚Äôm also curious to know if the account hacks affect consoles.
---
PvP for everyone!!
---
(downvote into oblivion)
---
Staying wanted is a real pain in the ass so my policy is keep them alive as long as I can
---
Maybe you're not understanding the account information and passwords for hundreds of people were posted online I'm not the only person that's happened to
---
A youtuber tried it last time. Nope. Don't waste your time.
---
Most of the time, its a trap. A group of 4 will make one guy wanted and hide. When players go to kill that wanted player, it ignites the pvp mechanics for the other people on the wanted players team. This then results in the hunter becoming the hunted as he is now going to get farmed.
---
Reddit has become my main social media I only fb for messaging my mates in College that's literally it I never go on nor post in it anymore and haven't done for months
---
Seems like only PC players are affected
---
This is a ghost camp left by a player that had logged out of the server, similar to all the collectron robots that get left in the world when you log out.
---
is there only pc people or console aswell?
---
If it has email you should probably contact them and tell them
---
I can tell your from personal experience that the hat spawns can be fickle. Once did like 30+ server hops and kept getting the same couple hats. (Literally spent a day off just grinding for the hats) still never got it XD
---
You found a BoS Hood? The thing Paladin Danse wears in 4??
---
Or I could use reddit
---
You literally just said move our duped weapons?    To me it seems you are implying that transferring your character will dupe everything?  Unless you are implying that you are a duper and you have a bunch of duped weapons you want to transfer?   \\
---
So you say you never said anything about duping?
---
" yeah that would be great if we could move our duped weapons to different platforms"  
---
I don't understand your response at all.   What are you meaning?
---
I am the guy who asked about PVP and more so about the alert. How does it initiate? Why no warning. How was he able to contest it if it wasn't at the main red bench. All good questions. 
---
You alright?  why being so combative over a simple thought on transferring characters?
---
Thankyouuu
---
60-90 days is my guess
---
Ahh ok that‚Äôs unfortunate I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs happened in the first place hopefully Bethesda are able to do something (they are usually pretty good at stuff like this) thank you for the info though.
---
I appreciate it but no thanks, I'm on ps4 anyway
---
When you go to craft you can see if you are missing any mods. Won‚Äôt say which ones but will tel you how many you have unlocked.
---
Oof :/ I hope ya get back at it apparently others have had some luck with it.
---
It should have been a day one feature, like PTT should have been. 2FA is BASIC security.
---
Can I message you to see if I'm on it?
---
Absolutely it is. https://bethesda.net/community/topic/368866/duper-cartel-have-had-their-passwords-stolen-and-accounts-wiped-talk-about-karma?language%5B%5D=en
---
Possibly the funniest fo76 video out there.
---
I really wish they led you somewhere cool but unfortunately just go in a circle.
---
Kill legendary enemies?
---
This. Saw someone wanted last night, had seen them that way before, I actually message them asking how often the bait was taken, ‚Äú Fairly often‚Äù I also asked if they were rocking a team of 4, they confirmed.
---
You can start Encryptid whenever you want! Guaranteed 3* enemy spawn with possibly more, good event rewards, challenging content. The only downside is how expensive it is to craft a keycard. 2500 caps, but you can get it to 1750. Then you need Flourescent flux
---
Yesterday three level 200 players came up to my camp - level 56 - and murdered my first ever Brahmin. I‚Äôll miss you, Bessy
---
If you don't, someone will.
---
Can you use this technique to destroy peoples camps? Let's say 1 decoy, 2 bodyguards, and 1 sapper to blow their camp to hell
---
Quad Broadsider don‚Äôt challenge me
---
Same. I toss them in my vendor.
---
Why say many word when few word do trick?
---
That should be fixed indeed; maybe give the teammates the option to instantly leave the team or become wanted too.
---
You if team up with a bandit, you are a bandit.
---
Not sure blockchain is the best solution but it's *a* solution which is better than nothing, which is what we currently have... Even just a database with unique ids for weapons/armor and legendaries with creation times and owners and other metadata would be simple enough to implement. But nope.
---
Whatever happens to be active. Uranium fever is fairly good. Awol can give directly good legendaries, I also try to buy legendaries from people farming them at westek ect, as it's a bit hard till several chars worth of 150 scrip every time I play.
---
Im not answering this. I dont condone the destruction of anyones camp. Pvp is one thing, but smashing someone's camp is pointless. You are just griefing and gain absolutely nothing from it.
---
I would be glad too.... Bottom line here is I honestly do not think Bethesda will do anything for me which is a shame because you know I have bought so many different accounts and spend my money on them over and over again the whole point of this is to try to save other people from the same thing happening so if you feel that your account may be at risk private message me your IGN and I will be glad to look at the list that I have to see if your name and password is on there I will not pass this list out the only people I will give it to is Bethesda support
---
Turns out there is a karma system in 76 after all.
---
Ok but I‚Äôm still left with many questions - do you reset characters to level 2 from client side? And if they have a list then it‚Äôll happen to potentially everyone in the game because they‚Äôre in the servers and our client details make no difference to those people (for this game at least). Drop table inventory...
---
This account was likely a duper and a h@cker stole their passwords and wiped all their duped inventories: https://bethesda.net/community/topic/368866/duper-cartel-have-had-their-passwords-stolen-and-accounts-wiped-talk-about-karma?language=en
---
I don't feel sorry. 
---
**Everyone liked this**
---
Yep, that one.
---
I made a triangle challenge out of it, and so it was less of a chore for me as I was server hopping the Asylum for outfits anyway: 
---
1. Asylum
---
2. Uncanny Caverns
---
3. Middle Mountain Cabins
---
Then server hop at the last stop and start a new round from there. You can put in your favorite legendary spawn location instead of my #1, or any other thing you usually server hop for, like Technical Data or the traveling vendor bot. Just turn it into a less monotonous loop, even if it takes a few caps to hop around on the map.
---
PS: I was embarrassingly lucky with these challenges today, found a cricket after just four hops and the last two scorpions after the seventh or so, but I've experienced far worse luck in the past with these.
---
Yes that actually works I just had decided not to
---
Dozens or 100s? Up top you say dozens but here 100s. How big a list are we talking about it exactly? Count the entries? If it's 100s people need to be made more aware of this.
---
this is all you need to know about the hack https://bethesda.net/community/topic/368866/duper-cartel-have-had-their-passwords-stolen-and-accounts-wiped-talk-about-karma?language%5B%5D=en
---
Thankyou for the reassurance
---
My favorite weapon prefixes are medics and instigating. I‚Äôm using a medics explosive combat shotgun with my vats crit Build and it‚Äôs pretty strong. I also almost never die anymore. When I feel like being sneaky or saving ammo I use my instigation / power atk dam combat knife from stealth. With escapist artist perk most enemies aren‚Äôt even aware of me sneaking up on them and I can one hit most of them with a power attack from stealth and I don‚Äôt even use any melee damage perks.
---
25 caps
---
The last I have is about 400 entries
---
Well maybe other players are acting like cucks and using they're strongest explosive weapons during uranium fever and deserve to be fucked with. I'll take your answer as a yes, thankyouu
---
I‚Äôve been pwnd on all my email accounts. But cannot see what websites, how can i find this out?
---
Wait, Marine Helmet was pulled? I need to charge more for the ones I'm making, then...

---
AH, on Reddit we have this little think called Karma...
---
"Karma is a b\*\*\*\*", so people try don't start a fights for nothing.
---
Well, that is my post, after all ;) I'd just like to spread the good word to widest audience.  
---
It's kinda funny though, devs turn blind eye, so it takes a hacker (or competitive duper group) to take these guys down.
---
I check the atom shop for freebies every time they update the advert/ loading screen for it. I was 3 days into the game when I discovered unmentioned freebies, they seem to do it all the time.
---
I came to my once and a guy was dropping orbital beacons on it. In pacifist so more annoying than anything but I messaged him and asked why?  His response...‚ÄùI‚Äôm bored‚Äù. Buttheads!!  I do find more good than bad though. I‚Äôm just starting to learn to run low on junk so at least they don‚Äôt get much. Then I proceed to block them and hop servers.   Best of luck!  I also play with hubby
---
I‚Äôve always felt this too. AA seems like a waste on any weapon that can get a perforating magazine or perks that give armor penetration. Now weapons like the .44 revolver and pump shotgun, AA makes a lot of sense since there‚Äôs no way to get penetration otherwise.
---
Yup.
---
Oh, come on, Zuckerberg, are you really trying to pull that on us? =D
---
If you are going to spy here, don't be that suspicious.
---
Had something similar happen to me yesterday, guy was selling a two shot 10mm that I wanted (pistol and vats build) but it was at a higher price than I had, I pm him and asked if there was something I could add to make the difference and he accepts. Long story short I got a new pistol and both of us left happy
---
Hmmm maybe in your Bethesda.net account then.  If it‚Äôs hard for a customer to access a receipt that‚Äòs a problem.
---
Hey! Cake Day Twins!
---
It is not legacy. I have like three or four for sale at 100 caps or less, I don't remember. It Is a bit rare, but it spawns randomly wherever you find BoS √ßorpses. If you want one, add me. Andreslamantis. Ps4.
---
Why do you think he's got a character named "DONTSELL" on one of those multiple accounts? I'll give you a hint:  [https://trello.com/c/d740kynM/955-andy2angry123-pc](https://trello.com/c/d740kynM/955-andy2angry123-pc)
---
Now it looks like my characters were deleted and then restarted to make it look like Bethesda deleted my account or rolls back my account but in fact that is not what happened. As u can tell from the screenshot s. Someone was actively entering each toon. (last played) ...
---
Great :/
---
I bought mine from Phoenix in Watoga. I think it‚Äôs available in Whitespring too. About 1,900 caps depending on perks.
---
TBH virtual currency is weird and starts overlapping with things like gift cards that aren't true currency.  Doesn't have to be RMC either, if memory serves there were a few court cases from gold sellers a dozen odd years ago due to it being a product of labor.
---
You deserve it :)
---
Only if they're asking to be killed over mic (and it doesn't appear to be bait.), if they're a low level toon that accidentally picked a lock in an owned workshop, or if it's someone hanging out in front of vault 76.
---
That last one is what I typically do myself if I'm ever wanted.
---
I can't work out what I'm doing wrong with triggering this event. Twice now I've bought the keycard, inserted it into the computer where the event is when prompted and.....nothing.  Any ideas? I've already completed the related questline.
---
Love this event and want to grind the rewards
---
Lol just make sure your not confusing this with the marine tactical. That all black motorcross helmet isnt the same as the one I first referred to
---
It looks well for its part.
---
That would be awesome.
---
You're*
---
Pleasure. Hope that you come across it soon.
---
Theoretically it should also spawn in some of the forward bases in the bog for instance but those places are 'raided' regularly for ballistic fibre.
---
Ok fine... What about the other 400 ppl that have no clue their info was online ?
---
I appreciate it but I wanna farm my own :)
---
A web browser will show all resources.
---
Reddit is ok but a fallout 76 wiki for finding out a list of weapon mods is helpful to see how much more scrapping is needed to learn mods.
---
Nope. High level players like myself would just have the resources to make everything weightless.
---
you seem like the type of person to cry all over reddit and bethesda forums about duping, all while trading and using duped items yourself.   Good job playing the white knight
---
Update a row triggering an update of last modified is normal DB stuff too
---
Yeah it‚Äôs be a good start. The only downside to using a plain database and not a blockchain would be more fragility. If the DB server goes down there goes all data up to the last backup.
---
And there is little to stop a error causing the database to just delete have the legendaries while with a blockchain there would need to be a consensus. In particular you can‚Äôt sneak a transaction into or out of the blockchain because many parties need to reach consensus on the change and there is a clear backlog to fix catastrophic changes.
---
A Tx pool works well too do fast changing actions and changes can‚Äôt be confirmed unless they make sense.
---
I send you Gun you send it to Jim Bob.
---
Where a dB might resort to just giving us all the gun in a race condition.
---
This is brilliant. I wouldn't even be mad lol.
---
No clue what u mean ur talking Chinese to me
---
Really? If so, I'm sorry, I was wrong
---
and then not only that as you were deleting my friends list they accidentally reported another player that's what tipped me off to this
---
Only cowards smash bases. Man up and go kill the person you have a problem with. Dont be little baby coward camp smasher. Before you know it, you'll get yours blown up too. Might want to consider your glass house before you cast stones.
---
YOU deserve it. That‚Äôs all I said. Obvious duper and I hope Bethesda thanks the hackers that did the job for them.
---
The fuck this is just plain fucked up for people to hack Bethesda accounts
---
Smh... Ok bud back to that shit...  Enjoy ur day
---
They have said they are working on 2FA
---
  Malware? Spyware? Trojan? 
---
Like... the Bethesda "launcher"?\^\^
---
It's good you showed him exactly what you can do in this game. His first few gaming sessions are gonna feel so much better now. Man, do you remember how dead it felt before you could travel to other people's camps?
---
I want a Dive Suit, a Drill, and a suit of T51
---
I wonder if you unlock the tenderizer plan, if a legendary version might come out the vendor.
---
is this a joke? your trade list is stocked to the roof with legacies and godrolls and you have the balls to accuse others of dealing in duped items?
---
Thanks brother. One last note - is it better to use the extra scrip and get 3 stars over 2?
---
You must be one of those douchebags screaming everyone outa their legendaries. Who's to say I'm not the one killing them dumbfuck?
---
Could you post a list of st least the usernames in the leak, so if someone‚Äôs been hacked at least they know?
---
If i see the mayor of Grafton i will execute him for his crimes
---
Hope you get your stuff back, glad I am on PS4 ..
---
Instigating for certain firearms, because it helps immersion. I do not enjoy spongy enemies.
---
When a ghoul or scorched gets a shotgun blast to the head, it should die. Same with radrats and wolves. 
---
Technically speaking, faster swing for small unarmed weapons gives you the "Martial artist" feeling. Sad thing we don't use both hands.
---
&gt;it‚Äôll happen to potentially everyone in the game
---
Nope. Op was duping and the script had a keylogger. If you weren't duping using that script, you're completely safe.
---
actually the op RMTs lol. he was selling the raid pa sets and given them away for free to his "friends"
---
You‚Äùre right! I used the perk once. It‚Äôs a waste of stims
---
andy that is what you get for using the hacks vrukrin and the others use .. lol
---
I don‚Äôt get that at all from his comment. Sounds like you‚Äôre just projecting your frustrations, in fact I‚Äôd even go as far as to say you are in fact a duper judging by how unnecessarily antagonistic you‚Äôre being.
---
Means it is not proof of a client login. I‚Äôll be honest here - I don‚Äôt believe you and I‚Äôm trying to help others do due diligence over your claims. Your story doesn‚Äôt add up, with the sole exception that I agree that 2fa is needed.
---
What console are u on?  Does it give you rads?  Did it stay glowing when u relog?
---
Well, it cannot come soon enough...
---
Hopefully is a technology that the Wastelanders will bring to WV before the BoS 'intercepts it for safekeeping' ;)
---
Yep, can confirm, happens a lot to me. And it's not just after the event, if you die with flux on you it's gone forever. Guess they were trying to fix people griefing for flux lol
---
Nice! Thank you for the advice friend :)
---
I know. I‚Äôd prefer some changes as well :)
---
Keep scrolling past the ‚Äú3 steps to better security‚Äù but.
---
True, true... :)
---
I‚Äôll try that!
---
I cant remember when they said it was coming but i definately saw it mentioned in a recent thread by them
---
look at his post history and his MASSIVE trade list of legacy and godroll items. he knows hes guilty of what hes accusing others of, its classic projection.
---
Dont make comments if your are going to delete them. Take your hissy fit elsewhere kid.
---
I‚Äôll drop 3 nukes on his ass I swear to god üò§üò§
---
What are the three boss equivalence for each raid?
---
okay well you know you don't have to believe me and if that's fine I'm just putting this out there you know for the other hundreds of people that had their account information online. I mean I'm not sure what's there not to believe you think I've had this game since beta and I'm only a level 2 on all my accounts
---
Interesting. Is the list purely login info or are there any preface/postface texts? Just wondering if there's any indication of where they came from and if it's a full dump or if there's more to come.
---
Question. If you are wanted do you still do reduced damage to other players until they shoot you?
---
Am I wrong? No? You hacked the game and want to get mad you got hacked. Karma dude. We all know you don‚Äôt give your shit away for free either. It‚Äôs not a perfect game but duper‚Äôs are certainly contributing to a lot of problems with this game. It‚Äôs not a morality thing. Go mod fallout 4 and good riddance to your cheat characters.
---
Lets see your trade list, and when I see you drop every dup in your inventory, then you can be as righteous as you want.
---
If I think it's a trap I go in, if I think it's an accident I might go in too but I will first ask if I should shoot them (fingergun emote, ?? emote)
---
Those are misc quest triggers btw
---
I have no clue.  I found this list posted.  Had my info on it and mannnnyyyyyy others...
---
Would 2FA come before or after in game chat lol.
---
West Tek. Charleston Capital Building. Burrows. Just to name a few.
---
Well if you play a lot and already have pretty good gear already, yes, you need a good 3rd star too. 
---
But in your case most likely you would be better off doing 2 stars.
---
They should. Might take a day if ya want to go back to the same sport to farm for junk.
---
Thats sort of ignorancy on your side tho. Your question is a wiki one.
---
come on guy, show us that list LOL
---
Just hunted 1 for the PS Trophy.
---
A moron says hey he must be using 3rd party software to dupe despite the exact same dupes being available on both on console and PC so maybe you should report to Microsoft and Sony that apparently console players for Fallout 76 are using 3rd party software to cheat in their games.
---
It must be because it's your happy cake day, congrats! And yes, you'll have to let it go. Don't want a randomly strolling by mole rat to claim that 1* piece of wood armor, do you?
---
aaand where did you get yours?
---
I think it refers to the way the data is saved on the medium, not how it displays.
---
It was in a discord .. someone seen it archive it then posted... It was taking down as far as I know.. but I was able to grab a link
---
Yesterday evening i dropped a nuke near where 2 blastzones were active already. Checked before launch and there was no SBQ event going on. Also on XBOX
---
What's interesting, prices are very... Local.
---
If ya got friends in US, EU and Asia, you can jump between the 3 datacenters where the game is hosted. Prices between those communities are completely different, with some items being scrip in one land and godroll in the other.
---
Hmmm, Took like an hour before it popped up for me :c
---
I dont trade, as you can see from my post history. get lost duper, we arent all like you.
---
40% faster swings speed. With martial artist I got a sledgehammer with the 40 speed to swing like a switchblade
---
I need to try this next time I try to take a workshop
---
I don't hack I run zero mods .. u have no clue what ur talking about...
---
I too am curious why you bought the game 5 times. Do you buy accounts for friends to use? 
---
Cause you can make multiple characters on one account, so I honestly can't understand why you would do that, aside from maybe selling accounts or having accounts for friends to play with you if they don't have the game. 
---
Not blaming you at all for it, though whatever keylogger or malware dll (could be a malicious mod even) got your accounts and passwords clearly got all of them, so it's something on your PC. That just sucks, I'm sorry man.
---
So you want hackers to hack Fallout 76, seems like your a moron.
---
Fallout with other people. Sometimes good sometimes bad.
---
Legendary drill: repairs camp items (at only 1hp per tick)
---
Yeah I don't play enough to accumulate heaps of scrip. Only lvl 90 with a bloody unyielding build. I'll have to a tonne of West Tek runs to get some scrip for the sale. I want a bloodied fixer badly. I'm using a bloodied auto combat rifle silenced and it's just ridiculous, I can't imagine how much better it would be with the fixers bonus sneak damage.
---
I'm fairly certain it's PC only. Given the mechanism behind it appears to be keylogger or malicious dll related grabbing the clear text password that's in a static memory location while you're logged in.
---
Wow someone los a lot of scrap last night? It‚Äôs ok buddy you can just dupe so more after you nap. Seriously though dude grow the fuck up
---
Imagine being so retarded you use third party programs, just overall programs for duping in fucking Fallout 76.
---
do you have any proof that I have ever duped anything?  Go back to mommy's basement and dont bother anyone for a while
---
So what I'm trying to figure out is if you can purchase in game items like weapons and armor for cash? Like, is Epic making money from these kinda sales or...?
---
You know what's great about the internet? Multiple resources of information.
---
Man, do you play with 3G internet connection ;)
---
&gt;aaand where did you get yours?
---
farmed it for the frist month  legit. have it on stream  since i palkyed witha  friend whos a streamer. :3
---
Thing is o don't run any mods at all ... Not 1 .. I'm a trader/collector of shit. Horder even u could say. One account was nothing but junk.. another guns /armor.   Shit 4 guys had nothing but chem food and shit from the 1st days of pvp ... And yes I do have 1 friend that plays on my account :)
---
Not anymore no. Not since Black Ops 2 on 360
---
So were you using a modded dll as mentioned in that other thread?   If so, you probably aren't going to get much community support...
---
bro I know who you are, I guess you dont recognize my name. You are trash that tries to justify your cheating by pretending everyone else is a cheater too.
---
I wasn't running any mods man ... Not 1
---
I didnt delete anything dumbass
---
The single greatest legendary mod is -25% VATS AP cost as it allows to align certain weapons to use 0 AP per shot
---
Didnt you understand part of my comment? Fix the armor or make it less crashing to other players by removing particles. I never opposed to just ignore this issue and keep using the armor.
---
Whats worse bullys on facebook or the circlejerk known as the Fallout 76 subreddit?
---
I've heard you need at least 1k for xp and loot
---
And frankly at this point if wastelanders isn't epic this game is dead for me...   But what about the other ppl that account and password we're compromised
---
Look at this guys imgur account name: 90smemelord
---
He is a well known scammer from the trading subs.
---
But why did you buy the game 5 times. That not something a normal user does.
---
Before... like in the next 1-2 patches. I play on console and don‚Äôt really see the big deal for in game chat. There are headsets for a reason. Yes I realize hearing impaired  would like another way. Accessibility is important and should be on their radar. This is a broader issue.
---
Who? I'm surly no scammer bud
---
His imgur name is 90smemelord. A well known scammer from the trade subs. Seems like he got what was coming to him.
---
Its on a preplanned path and changing that would be work.
---
Um... all those people are still dead. They aren‚Äôt being resurrected lol
---
Read above post friend...   I'm not normal.   This game was everything to me for a year... All I did in my free time...and ya think beshsda wouldn't mind.. 1 person spend all that money on their game...    Who are u to judge .  Just saying
---
This is the build I use. It is a bloody vats commando build. My main weapon is a bloodied explosive automatic prime handmade, my backup is a bloodied bats hit chance less vats combat rifle. I have a full set of Unyielding armor with various other stats on it. 
---
My carry weight is at 385, (with backpack), when im at low health, (I always maintain less than 20%).  My damage resistance is 323, energy resistance is 440, radiation resistance is 62. But those numbers will vary depending on what armor types you choose. 
---
A lot of people use dodgy with their bloodied builds, but since I use vats, I dont use it, as I dont want my ap being drained when I get hit. I can take a surprising amount of damage before getting downed with my current setup. With the bonuses from the unyielding armor, I almost never miss my shots in vats, and am usually hidden or caution when crouching. And with the high luck, my critical hits build up every 2 or 3 shots, and serendipity triggers on 2 of 3 hits. 
---
The build is not specced for pvp, but Ive never had too much trouble when fighting other people. But a few gear/perk changes would be required for a pvp build. 
---
Hope this helps. Ive posted this build before and got some criticism about a few things, but it works very well for me. I hardly ever die, and most enemies are one shot kills. The bigger enemies dont take much longer.
---
Yeah i saw you called me a douchebag and some incoherent thought about screaming at legendaries... idk what that even means.
---
You should know that even though you delete your comments, you can still see them in the comment tab of your profile. Dont be a liar on top of a little baby coward camp smasher
---
Splendid stuff. Every layer of security helps.
---
Disuading brute force/low skill/opportunistic attacks is not half the battle, but is a good opening move.
---
you sound more salty than OP did, looks like you should put the game down an move on.
---
Keloot u know I'm a trader nothing more.  I run zero mods and I don't hack
---
Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
Kill super mutants, take their laser rifles, put on scrapper perk, scrap weapons, get 11 plastic per.
---
U should remove your head out of raider legends ass. You used to be a cool dude
---
High agility from 5xunyeilding gives you very good sneak, yeah. I don't use any chameleon pieces on my bloody build.
---
I disagree: Anti-Armor weapons mean you don't have to waste perks or mod slots. Max out your ammo capacity and damage perks without losing armor penetration. I need to replace my energy rifles with AA so I can get rid of Tank Killer.
---
" **dialogue system being added in Wastelanders.** " Can't add whats already coded in the game from when this game was known as Fallout 4 hence why some players had weird bug show up where they had option to direct a follow to a position or attack something despite no companions being in game yet.
---
As there is no more SBQ not sure you can still launch nukes. Let's see.
---
ROFL  got proof? or you just salty you are terrible at the game? Anytime you guys with your all rise and excavator PA get killed in game, must be a hacker, right?
---
Can you imagine how fast they would fix a challenge that gave away atoms without completing it?
---
Soon TM
---
You might need to do the ps4 version of defraking.
---
What? There‚Äôs still SBQ. Legit launched last night
---
Get what you deserve duper.

Oh wow, didn't think of that.. now i have reason to visit west-tek again ..
---
You can't do any damage until they attack first.
---
So you ignore that your question is already answered elsewhere and make others do the search for you.
---
Well done mate :'(
---
Oh it's better than that.... if the OP ever went to the Atom store, bought a pizza online or (hopefully) checked his bank account balance that online keylogger undoubtedly captured his financial logins and account numbers.
---
I hope the 'leetness of his having 50 sets of two shot explosive  Diarrhea Armor was worth losing whatever was in his bank account
---
Can you expand on this OP? I can't understand why you'd claim this and not provide any evidence?
---
Same as this sub then
---
I know and it's not deleted.
---
Trading posts
---
PC master race. No rads. No it reverted to its original, non legendary, non glowing, level 21 state when I relogged.
---
But..... when I moved my camp again it went back to level 91 and glowing (not legendary this time) and stayed that way when I relogged.
---
Pets are weird.
---
Apologies, first time I posted it got autoremoved for K-9 CAMP Build being vague or click bait, edited it now and it should be there
---
Scraps your junk and sends it to your stash. Useless since most people have full or near full stashes and you can't choose which components to send.
---
Exact, but now they are mixed with alive people!
---
Yeah thats itü§îü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Good job and making yourself look dumb. The credit is all yours. I barely had to do a thing. Just letting you talk is enough. You probably want me to stop talking because you got caught in a cowardly lie that you cant back out of. 
---
So by all means, continue speakingü§£
---
How do you know you got any and where can you check?  I just started this to get the perks not really into pvp and this kind of stuff as it amps up my already existing anxiety and I don't have luck with teams.  I was looking for more detail as I am a novice and an idiot.  An idiot savant if you may.
---
Having few and having tons is different.
---
I think this is a super cooll idea, and yea this has a lot of good incentives for the player
---
but I dont think bethesda would ever do it purley because it's free atoms and they need as much of the atoms as possible after you use up all the reward ones
---
Also I doubt  they would make them scorched, they would have to be very high level creatures like schorchbeasts or the grafton monster. maybe even a new enemy type
---
Yeah lol that might explain some of it! but areas with a long draw distance like cliffs etc are awful, and Watoga especially!
---
Yup thats the comment he deleted
---
I think it's more likely that server hopping specific locations that guarantee high numbers of high level enemies saves time, as compared to finding the same number of high level ememies by random. Not that those locations have been blessed with a higher percentage of legendaries per se.
---
Psychology is a funny thing though. When just walking around without server hopping, there are a few locations I've gotten a disproportionate number of legendaries, but they're just random boring spots that people never recommend. Yet I'm drawn back to my secret "lucky spots" often, which obviously makes it more likely I'll keep getting lucky there. But just *maybe*...
---
How much is the vending machine paint set?

Lol. My post of several minutes ago, asks for the same proof, and I postulate the same conclusion. By claiming that many _others_ have been affected, the claimant actually hopes to use the generated interest to further his personal situation. Glad that there are others out there who can also pick up on this guys duplicitous claims.
---
Originally when they said we could build our camp anywhere that's what I thought would be possible that and building on infrastructure above ground level
---
They have already stated that the power plant, some other discovery places and the Queen, and a few of those challenges can not be completed by an older toon. You have to have made a toon after they patched it and then run that toon in order to complete. That was like 1-2 patches ago. I know, because I made a toon after they fixed it and was finally able to complete my stuff.
---
Really great build! How did you get this all in budget?
---
i also wonder how age skews the discussion.  with its ease of use, fb is definitely designed for ppl of all ages to get in and use.  also, reddit seems to have more PC users than console
---
nevertheless, at the beginning fo76 was indeed a toxic cesspool.  its only when those tryhards went on to other games that the true, consistent fo community stuck around.  i think thats why ppl are generally nice now
---
its none of my business what OP does in his game, he paid for it.  It just pisses me off you cucks come in here to talk your shit, and all this guy is wanting is some help to get his accounts restored and to let people know there is a massive list of peoples login info, what a terrible guy right?  but you're cool with that as long as your info isnt on that list, right?
---
Already did that.
---
Yeah this whole thing seems nothing more than eliminating competion between RMT dupers. I guess the less skilled ones got burned.
---
Yes but, until that happens (which could be a while) they should just ban it from public events.
---
You could have gotten away with like, 3 accounts then. 1 for mules (you can have as many characters as you want on one account), 1 main, and then one for your friend. What are the extra two for?
---
It's a trap!
---
Did you try doing it by starting the mission from MODUS?
---
Hey someone used psychological projection correctly!
---
Vini, vidi, vici.
---
thanks satan?
---
Yeah, when I took a break I was in the middle of the encrypted fights and crashed. I kind of put the controller down after that crash. I don‚Äôt know why it hit me so hard but it did.
---
Saw the same thing with mines but it didnt felt like the server had any issue with it
---
Thanks dude - cake day already, how time flies!
---
I guess fluffy felt the same way and has given up the legendary title... Until next year ü•≥
---
I shouldn't help guy who deliberately don't use search option, but at least some others may use the knowledge - I don't know if it's a bug or intentional, but for Handmade alone Powerful Automatic receiver isn't the best auto receiver ;) It's a straight damage increase, while Tweaked gives exactly the same damage bonus but also adds more critical hits damage.
---
*you're.
---
Get plan.
---
Use plan.
---
Purveyor can now drop a legendary fixer.
---
I ain't mad about the game, I'm mad about the devs and the CS. You took our money, bring us at least a decent game. I ain't asking for a masterpiece AAA experience I'm asking for a game management that's not half brain dead
---
I think you‚Äôd be right about taking on more tech debt by not using a regular database.
---
There are a few prebuilt options like BigchainDb(https://www.bigchaindb.com/services/ Apache license) but I‚Äôve never used it for more than as a toy.
---
I think the blockchain solution would allow better scale. 
---
I know about BigChainDB from a report a few months ago that it was being used to verify diamonds.
---
Please keep in mind they had 1 entire year to work on this game since release and still a lot of stuff to improve on, whats pathetic is the fact we had 2 events for the first year Fashanaut and Meat Week which is pathetic. Most games will have events going on every other month to keep players but this game can only release new atomic shop items.
---
It must be a quantity thing, this was literally 3 feet deep if our characters crouch at 4ft(just a guess on the measurement conversion lol)
---
I would think the mines would‚Äôve all exploded cause that would be cool af
---
Yeah I love it. It's like nuclear-steampunk themed
---
Levels Are not a big deal,  but i've saved up 64 unused if ever needed to respec or perk up something later on.. might wanna boost that charisma if you meet human npc's later üòÅ
---
If you're using an external hard drive, maybe your cord is pooping out? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I don't know how you did this within the budget. My one single building seems like it has way less in it. It looks amazing though! Imagine what we could do with just a slightly higher budget!
---
&gt; muggle friends
---
Are you a geocacher?
---
Noon in what time zone?
---
I've seen this multiple times now - once in the forest near Charleston, once near Kiddie Korner in the Toxic Valley and south of Watoga in the Bog, so I'm pretty sure this can spawn anywhere a random encounter can spawn.
---
I only use fast travel when I need to get somewhere quick, otherwise I walk. I've killed multiple flatwoods monsters, ran into the vengeful mothman and seen more than a few weird encounters like this. When I hear a 300 level complaining of not seeing this stuff I can only assume they fast travel way too much.
---
Talk a walk. You'll never know what you'll see.
---
Surprised there is much of a use for that. It‚Äôs mostly incentivising Bethesda not to put stash boxes around which is frustrating.
---
Serious question... why are you (and others) so excited for human NPCs? I think it will be an interesting change but didn‚Äôt mind NPCs being robots and liked that only humans were actual humans and not just some code sitting on a server. Nobody has really explained to me and I‚Äôm genuinely curious what the allure of human NPCs is. I am looking forward to dialogue trees, but that could happen with robots.
---
BoS headwear can be kind of difficult to find reliably but your best bet is to farm the ranger center in the cranberry bog since it has multiple hat spawns. I actually found a couple hoods 2 days ago so its definitely still available.
---
The marine helmet (actual helmet) was never in the game legitimately and was taken from the Dev room on PC. That said they have no plans to add it currently but will not do anything if you happen to get one through trading and scrap it to learn the plan.
---
Take my upvote! Would be wonderful
---
I agree with you fully. I hate pvp games. Hate them. However, I love NW, its awesome. I also love the additional challeges rewards that we can use in adventure mode as well. Heres to more maps and more NW.
---
To me those people always looked like mule accounts who know what they're doing, but caps are probably so worthless to them they'd rather scrip their gear if they can't sell it at absurd prices.
---
Lol at level 325(beta) I feel your pain.  What pisses me off is that I started power leveling from lvl 185 when I heard about legendary players and now that‚Äôs feeling like a pipe dream!
---
Good idea about charisma.  Might go for that food build to get my karma right haha!
---
Already got it, thanks for the confirmation.
---
That‚Äôll be 500 atoms please.

At this point fuck it where do I sign? üòÇ

when it's ready...
---
You could always get on the mic and actually talk...
---
The latter.
---
Thanks for the extremely helpful comment. But honestly that seems like the least possible answer anyone could have given to this answer especially considering the track history of this game
---
Look in the fallout ini. Files. There should be lines starting with R G B both for your pip and hud.
---
Dude you're caught. Own it like an adult. Otherwise you must be twelve, and I hope that your parents are proud of the idiot they are raising.
---
This is a great idea.
---
While that's valuable info, I don't think we can conclusively say that everyone on that list was a duper. The same dll (or similar) could be present in pretty much anything, any mods or tools used by legitimate players that may have had the DL intercepted or through dll injection. But at the same time, OP *might* be lying, and could have been selling duped items. It entirely depends. I'm not willing to blanket make the assumption that OP was duping without clear evidence that s/he was.
---
That thread doesn't provide conclusive evidence exactly.
---
I love everything about it
---
Read again please ‚òùüòÇ
---
It would seem that the only ones affected were people who used a third party cheat script of sorts. So not really Bethesdas fault. You should very likely be safe.
---
So you did Vault 94? The Burrows? The storylines, backpack, sheepsquatch, Arkos? And holy shit on screws... what do you use screws for that you have to do a run every day. And all my awesome legends were provided by the Mole Miner trader... Mama Murphy (I can't spell her name... so she's mama murphy... always wanting scribs and giving me stuff for it) before she takes off the hood. Witcher 3 is a good game. And see you in the wasteland when others pop up. o/
---
It's extremely easy and takes less then 5 minutes and literally one server change - all you have to do is get a teammate for that challenge. You both fast travel to Mire to the place slightly north of where Prime Cuts happened - there is 100% megasloth spawn there. First you shoot him once not kill it and you leave your teammate dodging sloth for a while (don't leave team). You fast travel to any Bog location and when you're there your friend finishes the sloth. You got the challenge done because you were in the Bog ;) Then you switch server and do opposite for your teammate for the challenge to count.
---
you have to initiate the recall after the prompt, it's a separate "click" on the terminal, realized that after trying it 3 times
---
I want Jeepers creepers start randomly on playing on the radio, than get ambushed by mothman or a scorched beast in the middle of the night. When then die you can retrieve a harpoon from them corpse as an Easter egg.
---
Wish I had bought that from you...
---
lever action is my favorite... I don't even have a legendary one.
---
Thanks, I'll try that! These are expensive mistakes I'm making!
---
I've done it in 15 minutes and around 5-6 server hops - there are three popular locations in the Savage Divide that spawns radscorpions - Middle Mountain Cabins, Freak Show and Top of the world. You start with closest one, visit all 3, switch server and do all three opposite way.
---
This is the best! I love encountering pure moments in the game with others like this :) warms my heart; so cool to see you made their day by being so generous!!
---
I hate it when people try to talk me into a lower price. I had a dude ask me to come down from 4K on an explosive furious machine gun. I was in a hurry trying to play so I changed the price to 1k cause they said they had no caps. They buy it. I travel to do a daily. Now they are trying to get me on a team and travelling to me asking what other weapons I have.. Are you kidding me? I give you a deal and you pester me? Than icing on the cake, I got on area chat and said I was in a hurry and to add me. Five minutes later dude suddenly has caps as he starts buying my practically free plans I throw in for low levels. What a dick.
---
Really burying the lede on this one.
---
How random dudes on reddit can give anyone more precise answer for it? We all know the same that Bethesda published, so the question was naive...
---
loll what a workaround. props tho
---
Other locations you should try are Huntersville, the burrows , and crevasse dam.
---
&gt;Also before anybody comments it I'm talking about console. I already know about the whole INI files thing on PC.
---
Nah internal original. I guess had want to shit but im looking for other fixed before running out and buying new one.
---
You need to respawn. Staying dead on the floor allows players to do this. Legs are normally focused on first as to over-encumber users as pretty much all PA users have Calibrated legs.  
---
You either seek revenge, or you respawn with ignoring the situation, but respawn regardless.
---
Purveyor likely rigged to drop even worse crap than usual during sale.
---
In that case, it was probably removed by moderators. As far as I know, comments deleted by users themselves disappear even from their comment history, while removed comments just become invisible in the thread where they have been posted. And they even remain visible to the user who made them, the only way to find out about your comment being moderated is to open the thread without logging in.
---
I find it really hard to find my tiny aiming dot in third person sometimes. God help me if they use the colour-coded conversation choice from Fallout 4. It took me ages to find out there were three of them.
---
It's a *video game* bruh, y'all act like it's a an actual post-nuclear simulator. You get hit with radiation, you're not jumping 20 feet in the air, you're getting cancer and dying.
---
Even World of *War*craft doesn't force you into PvP, stop acting like everyone's supposed to just accept shit like that.
---
Purveyor likely rigged to drop more crap than usual during sale.
---
Of course üòÇ, thanks means I don't have to worry about it just now, where is he so I can get a wee look at him though?
---
Me too! Id friend request you, but that would defeat the purpose.
---
Yeah i always felt like that was a ballache, i mean it means you can sell it without learning it if you don't want it, i did that with the american flag and it got snapped up straight away.
---
Just two, only buying 2* at Purveyor.
---
Im new to reddit and i definitely like it better than anything on Facebook
---
There are 10 pumpkins around the Pumpkin House. You don't have to go anywhere near the fissure. Also if you put on the perk that allows you to harvest more flora, you only have to pick 5 pumpkins not the full 10.
---
Didnt know or realize this! Thanks!!!
---
North west of Harper's Ferry at Lewisberg? Station.
---
*Veni.
---
Or if you become wanted, the Wardens come and get you.
---
Nicely done
---
Stick..... Stick your dick in it.
---
I'm sure it'll work with radscorpions too, but problem here is there is there is no 100% spawn location for those bastards ;)
---
Epic, isn't it Bethesda?
---
In 76 you can't trade atoms with other players, so I'd suppose it's mostly whoever is running that platforms market.
---
As for in game, non RMC, it varies.  Those can have a grey market or official storefront.  I doubt 76 got big enough for the companies dedicated to grey market to bother.  Just lots of indy ebay things.
---
Keep in mind even RMC items aren't sacrosanct.  Usually EULA's have a rider that allows things to be changed/removed with no compensation.  Seen it happen a bunch with FtP steam games.
---
I get a full set of power armor at one of my toons camp locations by Whitesprings. Pops right inside the house. I laugh when the dude starts yelling at me to get outta his armor, then I go scrap it. Stay outta my house raider dude.
---
That's how I did it minus the top of the world. Unlucky day I guess
---
Sorry but imo that's a waste. There's enough "3 star only"  elite traders that will care. You can still stick it in your vendor pretty good
---
I hit MMC and FS. I can never find one at Top of the World. I was shocked when I went to Uncanny and the cricket just walked up to me like... kill me... kill me now. Usually I get mongrels or wolfs.
---
mmm - for people like us, in exactly this situation, I'd say that there's space for "kill parties" where we group up in a designated place and each become wanted and are killed/kill to meet PVP goals. Same as we did with the revive tasks for the backpacks. BTW, if anyone's still in need of backpack revives, HMU. I'll totally do that for you.
---
yeah.... I don't Facebook at all. I have messenger lite to talk to my grandparents. that's pretty much it. the only purpose of fb is to remind me that everyone from my school are pretty much idiots.
---
If I'm not actively doing something else that would be interrupted I will happily travel clear across the map to go after a 5 cap bounty. I always going in expecting it to be a trap, but you really never know what you're going to get. Sometimes you get a whiner that cannot fathom why you would go out of your way to kill them for their bounty. Sometimes you get thanked. 
---
When it's a trap, I just try to kill as many of them as I can. As long as they don't start running their mouths I'll keep coming back for more as long as they want to fight. Soon as they start running their mouths and getting stupid I leave. All there is to it.
---
I was lucky to get 5 crickets on first visit - one was even legendary. It seems that when you're high level you're more likely to get molerats, wolfs and moleminers that crickets there.
---
Awesome thanks!!
---
Take my upvote. Everything you‚Äôve said here is right on. I‚Äôve been running the raids since their inception and it‚Äôs unbelievable what an inaccurate picture people paint of them. They‚Äôre entirely playable end game content for high level team play and they serve that purpose well.
---
Sometime between when management says "put it out now" and when it is actually ready for release. No sooner, no later.
---
might have been a givaway. 
---
Well before I had completed the BoS quest, I bought the plans and made a set of Ultracite.  On completing the quest, was awarded a full set...so now I have 2.
---
Bot vendor price is really low, dont have the weight to sell the parts individually.
---
Might drop it, might give it away.  Havent decide yet.
---
Bethesda has been *very* clear that the Scorched and SBQ will still be in the game.
---
Dude same
---
Noice
---
I've thought they look a bit similar to 8-track tapes since I played my first fallout game lol
---
*&lt;enter dwight mode&gt;* 
---
**FALSE!** Players can currently injure others using rad damage from nuke mines and pumpkin grenades whilst they are not actively engaged in PVP or even in full pacifist. Also, people are using player's mutations that provide area damage to injure them as well, but I'm not sure how that works.
---
Thanks? But in the rules it says I'm allowed to remind people that harrassment isnt kool?
---
Really not sure how a person telling his coworker thinks I was rude too has to do anything with reddit
---
I heard a bunch of dupers just got their account info stolen and lost all their shit after using a program with a keylogger. Pretty hilarious.
---
I'm excited because it means the story is actually going to progress. Plus, living people are more interesting than robots, lol.
---
Right? I haven‚Äôt thought about Gurren Lagan in forever but just reading the title gave me chills and made me wanna rewatch it.
---
I've been after a 3* IE Lever. Mind if I add you? Name is skullcap_sorcery
---
I‚Äôm excited for story progressing as well, I guess I just don‚Äôt see big deal with robots. Rose is a good example of an interesting robot.
---
Reddit is social media too üòÇ
---
My ps4 is on it's last leg myself. I have to periodically initialize the console for it to run smoothly. It'll clear all your info and games though. It's not to much of a pain with an external hard drive, but would be pretty annoying without.
---
I don't think it's really the "human" people are missing. 
---
I think it is the dialogue choices people really miss where it felt at least a little bit like a real conversation. 
---
And also because the world feels a bit empty with only a couple dozen humans to maybe interact t with in a world map bigger than any other Fallout yet.
---
Try Westek and atlas observatory.
---
Depending on your level and how long you've been gone - WS golf club has changed - instead of the critters hanging around in their respective rooms waiting for you, they now swarm you all at once when you walk in the door.
---
All the facebook and playstation trading comunities are so toxic its unbelievable
---
&lt;3
---
It reverted to its original, non legendary, non glowing, level 21 state when I relogged.
---
I was wanted for a full day before someone got the tencaps for my head. It was a lonely day couldnt see any camps or players
---
I wholeheartedly agree, with one exception. 
---
If you really want to fuck someone‚Äôs camp up, nuke it. They have fair warning to server hop, but it‚Äôs still a giant inconvenient ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù. And if they don‚Äôt hop, their camp is destroyed, but you did it in an honorable, epic way that allowed them to take action to prevent it.
---
For me it is about the flux, and only about the flux. I get nothing but angry with myself when I die after the queen. The other day I ran up to R R E (loot all) her corpse and a bear jumped out of her belly instantly taking my bloodied commando down. Bye bye flux. 
---
On my bloodies I try to pop a radaway and heal as soon as the fight is over just to protect my loot a bit. Then it becomes all about looting her asap and getting to the nearest camp or watoga station to store my flux. Then I'll come back and start searching meat piles. 
---
Bag grabbers suck, but it is part of the game. I've taken stuff on accident, doesn't make it right but it is easy enough to do.
---
I haven't played the game in several months (I loved it, but got caught up in other things), but it's good to hear the in-game community is still friendly.  
---
I recently got back into GTA Online after 2-3 years away, and that community is (still) horrible. It's the exact opposite of the 76 community in nearly every way.
---
What‚Äôs your GT, I def wanna check out club fuzzy.
---
It‚Äôs been awhile since I cleared westek did they add new stuff to those locations? I‚Äôll give the golf club a whirl too but am I likely to find legendarys at the same rate there? Also my level 150+ with end game legendarys.
---
Karma
---
I'll answer. I've never done it before because that is a pretty hardcore dick move even for my raider character, but the game mechanics pretty clearly point out that yes indeed you can.
---
I see a lot of grim reapers sprint and no four leaf clover on these kinds of builds. I realize most single shots would be a kill but a chance to refill AP per hit seems better, especially with several rounds firing with a commando. I have almost all the same perks as you except that he's a rifleman and I use four leaf clover. Just curious if I'm " doing it wrong" without grim reapers sprint lol
---
Check the map for horde events. They don't pop as public events, and most of the time, they get ignored - the exception to this is when it's a super mutant horde in the Mire or the Bog. Since you're looking for scrip, you can go for quantity over quality and take whatever you see. Leader of the Pack is nearly guaranteed to drop 3 \* legendaries. Not a ton of scrip, but every little bit helps. AWOL Armaments typically has at least one \*\*\* enemy and often 2-3 of them. Also doesn't pop as public so you'll have to keep an eye out for it (or, if you're on PC, the Event Notifications mod is EXCELLENT).  Also, check player vendors. Many will have garbage legendaries for sale cheap.
---
It's a combat rifle with pretty good stats.
---
I always do.. fully knowing that it's probably a trap.  S'ok.  It's fun anyway.  :)
---
I would also appreciate a chainsaw to uh cut down trees. That‚Äôs it. Trees
---
Outstanding!
---
Yeah, be careful of this, I was suckered a while back. Some guy was hanging out by the Whitespring Station asking to be killed over voice chat. So I did it but he had Mysterious Savior on and killed me when he got resurrected. Didn't lose anything valuable but it was very annoying.
---
Or that "beautiful" modern art thingy; it looks like someone was on Daytripper when they designed it.
---
A while ago a random player bought a bunch of stuff from my vendor and then asked if he could lock pick my 1 locked water generator to become wanted. I found it super odd at the time but now I'm assuming he wanted to pvp with someone and make it known. I'm glad he asked before just doing it, though.
---
Any bag left unattended is public property.
---
Sounds legit lol
---
Good job!   I have a vamps ffr mini gun i use for the imposter squatch fight......same as you basicly just tank everything. Never done it alone tho
---
FB is straight cancer. Granted, I'm very glad for their money and support that goes to Oculus, but I am also extremely grateful that they don't make you have an FB account to use the Oculus store.
---
This is really, REALLY impressive. Well done!
---
Wasn't for quite some time after launch. Granted launch was rocky, but it seems all the people that aren't playing the game, and never planned to, but wanted to trash talk it have all gone back to FB.
---
If you notice the wall with the posters, only in the close up it has more than 4 posters. I did this in a few shots just for the videos. None of the insides really have a lot of stuff. I actually don't like building huge camps and prefer more crowded areas. If I do build a big camp I usually allocate 50% for structures and 50 for decor. This one was more like 60/40. I wanted to build a comic book store but couldn't do magazine racks.
---
heavy doubt
---
Thanks for sharing
---
Generally, yes.
---
But I think what makes Facebook different is that their motivations are so transparently amoral, if not outright malicious.  Zuckerberg's infamous "dumb fucks" comment, referencing how easy it is to manipulate people into handing over private information to do with as they please, characterizes their entire company.
---
I haven‚Äôt done so in awhile, but when I do it‚Äôs usually just to work toward the atom challenge. Most times I‚Äôll ask if they want their wanted level removed and they tend to respond in the affirmative‚Äîusually it‚Äôs a low level player who picked somebody‚Äôs lock.
---
On rare occasions, I‚Äôll deliberately walk into a trap; and before I attack I‚Äôll drop a baggy with some fertilizer, a flip lighter, and one of those ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been insulted‚Äù notes
---
Yep, he rmts and then he'll complain whenever someone rmt/dupes in his discord, the amount of hypocrisy is real.
---
agreed.  the fact that every "save me" quest ended in tragedy was so psychologically disorienting.  just, like, a real bummer dude.
---
I've deleted facebook. Anyone got an American only social media platform cause that's what I want.
---
Wow!!! That‚Äôs creative!
---
To be honest, I'm excited that everybody is not dead. Now I'm also very interested in legendary SPECIAL and new weapons and perks. Characters are just a bonus.
---
Awwww....well damn.
---
I actively change servers looking for them
---
Makes Sense, I've had a whole thread removed before, and it's currently at the top of my post history, I could still find it via "replies" but it didn't apear on the feed for the reddit, and didn't know it got deleted till someone who bookmarked it could no longer get to it.
---
I'm level 140 and just found out about this yesterday. Waited at my camp for someone to kill me. He took my junk bag though so when he relaxed and tried to get rested XP from my bed I logged so he'd fall to his death.
---
Facebook was awesome when it was just me and my college friends and you needed a .edu email address, but once they let the high schoolers and baby boomers in it was all over. I found Reddit like fiveish years ago and dropped Facebook like a bad habit. Don't miss it at all.
---
If I recall correctly, Four Leaf Clover has a chance of refilling the critical hit meter, rather than AP. However, I also think that Critical Savvy is better than Four Leaf Clover or Psychopath for the same number of perk points, because at rank 3 it almost doubles the frequency at which criticals can be used.
---
I ate it
---
The prefix Holo means "complete" also. Since there's no hologram I'd go with that definition
---
You get more when mining a ore node, without you get one, with the armor you get 4 (verified last night still works). I use it when I farm ultracite.
---
I have an extra if you're on PS4. Wasn't too sure how much to price it at on the market. I'd trade it for a Fixer plan
---
It‚Äôs not a pubic event, so it‚Äôs not in the timed rotation, but to my knowledge you can‚Äôt initiate it yourself, it just has to pop up. (I hope I‚Äôm wrong I want to grind this event)
---
I do Distant Thunder all the time. It's not a public event, nor do I know of it having a manual trigger. It just shows up on the map spontaneously, but you have to watch the map closely for it, because once someone starts it, it's over in less than a minute.
---
You need a weapon with a recon scope for it to randomly trigger.
---
I thought they were trying to ruse me. That makes more sense. They kinda shake it off.
---
I simply don‚Äôt know what to sell weapons for so end up scriping them
---
And often they look good for another build.
---
But I need the space and don‚Äôt want the hassle of googling around for prices.
---
The power plants are not part of the world event system.  Essentially the quests are always active unless completed. If completed, the quest goes into a cooldown of several hours.
---
Sometimes, but I don't kill them I sneak up on them and I finger bang them.
---
Dude, why would you openly admit that to someone who clearly wants to grief? Lets just teach a bunch of noob squeekers to blow up peoples bases while they are shopping. Use your head! What people aren't smart enough to figure out, isnt going to be an annoyance later on. Hence why we have griefers tossing nuke mines at people.
---
Ah, I think you're right, it does do crit meter. I'll look into this more as I use dodgy, so grim reapers sprint may be best. Thanks!
---
Ayy time to accept Bethesda does not care what we want. If they did they would have put some real time and effort into making a sustainable game. They're still getting away with robbery and this sub is asking for more every day
---
Exactly the same bugs on PS4. #1 is the most annoying. I simply quit the game and play something else after a few fast travels are ignored. Not spending a single Atom until it‚Äôs fixed.
---
Powerful and Tweaked, Tweaked is the best smae damage better crits.
---
Have you tried editing the .ini files?
---
No, they aren't. But these games and the legal cases that often arise involve RNG items that give a significant advantage to those who spend money on them. It's easier to bring suit for duping, exploits, cheating when the actual monetary damages can be proven. 
---
So basically, can Epic prove monetary damages for the 14 year old cheater (doesn't matter. They settled. We'll never know) 
---
I mean, I hang out with my collectron more than anyone else, but that guy sometimes sucks. And I'm pretty sure he's stepping out. I keep running into his "friend" aimlessly walking not too far from my camp. No. Go home. 0101011111 
---
Okay, back on track:
---
Bethesda doesn't sell the items that are involved in RMC right now. And AFAIK, pretty much every other MMO has items for cash you can buy directly from Epic? Because if that's the case, it's really interesting to compare the differences when Bethesda will have a real hard time proving monetary damages, because they don't have any.
---
I just can't get a straight answer about games like fortnite, because everyone would rather argue about a fucking refrigerator and my best wasteland friend. No, you're still gonna kick my ass. 
---
They need to have a setting so your collectron can just follow you around the map, carrying your refrigerator for you. Still no actual advantage here, but it I don't have to walk to the fridge for a beer anymore, I'll take it.
---
Just so you're aware, the plasma grenade plan *only* drops from events and has no chance to drop from explosives crates.

I'm usually on at night after the kids are in bed.  9 pm EST.
---
Oh yeah 100%
---
I‚Äôll have to try keeping one on me. I usually use reflex sights.
---
I particularly remember that quest because of how all the random players came together at roughly the same level, worked together, and were excited by just the general loot table of reasonably low level stuff - even a laser pistol.
---
There's not a whole lot of point returning there if you've already eclipsed it with gear, money and levels. It certainly doesnt have the same magic if you're solo, or accompanied by someone in enclave power armor etc.
---
Then I request that you look at this video
---
I use Optismed Bracers, which do nothing in regards to Ore mining

I started out by building up my AA melee weapon collection, but then I made a switch to Vampire's melee. If the queen has landed outside of the blast zone, I can pop a diluted Rad-X and just hack away at her head. For this reason, Furious is also nice.
---
I had one recently and dropped it because I had a sack hood that I like better. Are they rare? I thought only the forest ones were rare.

Inventory management?

I‚Äôll have to keep a close eye on the map then. Thanks!

I believe I have that mod on my lightest combat armor. TBH I have not used any other armor other than marine armor in a while, but I do not recall ever getting a combat armor plan for lead lined. It had to have come from deconstructed armor.
---
Honestly, before I started using the ultra light build mods on marine armor, I was only using lead/enamel lined metal armor with the deep pockets mod. That, for certain, came from  deconstructed pieces. Legs, limbs, and chest. Altogether it added like 50 to your carry limit and that worked until I got excavator power armor for bigger hauls of junk and weapons. All else fails if you are on xbox, I think we could meet up and I can make a bunch of lead lined pieces for you and you can decon them all until the mod unlocks? I am not sure if it will work that way, but we can try.
---
Do you carry binoculars? You need something that can mark targets.
---
Just regular event that shows on map from time to time. I always do it when possible, since it's easy to do (you go there, kill all scorched) and... that's it. And rewards can be rare plans.
---
Damn whats with the disappering megasloths ive lost jeremy awhile ago but he hilds aplace in my heart
---
Oh, good. Glad we could help!
---
Bloodied
---
The use photomode at red rocket stations was broken for me last as well
---
No, you don't need to mark anything (it's mark as optional) - I just go there and kill all scorched. The bombardment don't even starts.
---
yeah i was just thinking the same thing last night!  they are a bit behind id say
---
I will agree with you here. Maybe is just easier to say ‚Äúyay human NPCs‚Äù rather that discussing the dialogue trees, choice/consequence, etc
---
Biggest reason I want to start grinding it. I just found out that it drops pa plans.
---
I ended up not being alone too, but I certainly built / planned to tackle it alone. You should totally try it!
---
I play melee with a 1\* vampire switchblade and typically do not use peformance enhancing food, etc; might be a bit more difficult than with an end game legendary.
---
That said, I did Westek for the first time over the weekend.  Lots of high level SM's simultaniously and a couple of 2-3 star lgendaries.  
---
Atlas was full of Col Gutsies with at least one stealth/chameleon Assaultron.
---
WS legendary drops are different.   Non-nuked, the clubhouse may have 1.  
---
Lately, there's typically a 3\* upstairs in the same place you found the sword during the mysteries quest.  Thet building also swarms now.
---
Last nuke I did there, I think every bloated glowing one on the property descended upon the house.  I stopped the counting at around 50.  Have to admit, I didn't melee that crowd :)
---
We could start a club? Would that be ok? Not a circle of friendship, just a club where we all hate each other.
---
Appreciate it!!
---
I experience all these bugs on ps4. The horde event example is different. I think the game is trying to put you near the horde leader and sometimes puts you in a weird spot. Some players used to get spawned into vault 63 when traveling to the event in the mire.
---
I brought my bloodied guy to sbq last night, got NO legendary off her. I looted her fast because there were adds to kill. I got a prime lmg receiver plan, gamma gun and other stuff off her but no legendary... Gamma gun is the new drill?? smh
---
Mostly because it's really just basic game mechanics. It's not even an exploit. And that sort of information is open to anyone. 
---
Besides, a refusal to answer and verify is all the verification needed.
---
Right - farm this and Census Violence, both can reward rare plans for PAs and other rare plans like Ultracite Gatling Laser.
---
Good job bro that‚Äôs impressiveüëçüèªI‚Äôve seen many times a bunch of level 200 and 300+‚Äôs fail the event because they simply dump ammo on the invisible imposter and nobody cares about the pylons.
---
Any idea how much damage has to be done to get loot? I fought her as a lvl 50 and was doing meh damage as a melee, but I still got personal loot from her when she died, which I thought was odd. I didnt expect to get anything.
---
Ive had 5 or 6 pets now and all of them just vanished except for my level one attack dog he was a pitbull with a red bandana he was an ex blood gang member that fled from tge trey way gang when 6ix9ine flipped just to be killed by a level 42 sting wing (you will missed roxus)
---
Ah I get why I'm being downvoted now. Console players.
---
It was super-buggy but not completely broken - each station my friend and I tried different positions (top of the sign, in front of the sign, etc) until we had successfully completed the challenge. We also took pictures.
---
Nice! Thank you!
---
Haha fair enough I'm currently in hospital on pain meds high af. My bad haha.
---
why would they, there is no gain for them.
---
You must be picking up scrap weapons with a recon when it triggers for you, it does not need to be equipped.
---
Wow.... 6 months of staying away for them to improve the game for....this?
---
Nice! I'll take a look, thank you.
---
Yep, I am aware of that, however I use a core assembly for the torso and have the same results 4 from each node.
---
Or it's to ask you if you want to do a raid, or gift you workshops, or trick you into PvP, or it was an accident and they meant to click your base, or they just want to team up with you or......
---
Tbh I just checked the atom shop and like, there aren't any new hairstyles except for maybe one, and there's hardly anything new or exciting in the shop... I'm at a standstill after 30 minutes...
---
How are your knees doing?
---
Yikes...
---
My Brahmin gets murdered once a day. It seems like a ritual at this point and I‚Äôve become dead to it
---
Can i be the guy at the door who turns people away?
---
You sold a best tier high end weapon for 2500 caps and you were surprised by the buyers reaction. Interesting. 
---
Last time a checked somebody wants 60k caps and a lot of 5.56 rounds for that kind of weapon. Some peoples want even more than 60k. 
---
I understand when you sell/give away cheap junk, meds or ammo just to help new players but this weapon is hard to get. I read somewhere that the chance of getting good roll on a weapon in Fallout 76 is like 1:250 000. 
---
I just don't understand why it is wholesome interaction. If you find random player and just drop him stuff for 100k caps I'm sure that his reaction will be even more wholesome.
---
You‚Äôve got some sweet stuff going there! I‚Äôm going to use it as none else shared a build :D
---
This sounds like a lot of sarcasm.... lol.... How sad. No Man's Sky turned a rough launch into a great game and this is how many months in without anything major being added? I mean, nuclear winter.... cool I guess...
---
I don't picking up any weapons for a long time - I learned all weapon mods and don't need them to scrap. Really, this event can be done with any weapons and don't require anything to mark targets. It also shows on map for everyone.
---
This is great - thanks! Now if only someone could post a travel route for legendary spawns...
---
CGT
---
Something like an... anti social social club?
---
Nope not true. When you‚Äôre low level they simply drop low level legendary stuff for you.  Just hop server and farm scrips in WS. Those robots will help you too. Uranium fever guarantees three in 8 minutes, not bad either.
---
People keep trying to add me to their group randomly. I always WANT to add them, but I hear so many stories about grouping up and then getting killed so I usually dont add people. I usually solo play so I have my lone wanderer perk on 24/7, which would mess with my stats if I added someone :/
---
It can be done with any weapon, you do not need to mark them, but you do need the ability to do so for it to spawn. If you can prove that wrong, I will apologize.
---
Hi! You may have already tried this, but just in case: When you get this message and then head into Adventure Mode, can you try gaining any amount of XP there? That should trigger the level up to kick in. Thanks!
---
It won't work if you try to use it, get another dude
---
This guy could've went on and been completely ignorant to the fact. Also now you are just entertaining aspiring griefers. Didn't your mother teach you when to keep quiet? Or common sense?

Even on PC, with all the horse power you can get, the server ticks kill me.

I can not stand seeing my game freeze for a full second or more every 15-20 seconds. Full 60 FPS everywhere other than the ticks. Just load more grids at once i dont know just fix the damn issues!

Hey everyone, I've found a method to make money rather quickly and I'll discuss how it works. Go to https://earnmoneywithpackity.com and register. Then, add as lots of gadgets to the app as you can to optimize revenue. I'm making today 1.80$ daily. It works by utilizing your unused internet for scientific research. It does not lag your internet and you will not notice it! You can lunch the application and leave it and it will work and earn money for you. Try it!
---
A gauntlet build with a backup legacy laser sounds utterly terrifying in PvE and PvP alike.
---
I love when people visit my camp! I always try to leave them gifts and emote them but most just buy something and leave lol. Oh well.
---
This community is my favorite.
---
Seamlessly? Lol
---
See everyone, psychopathic possums. They real.
---
It's your theory, so you should prove me otherwise linking to any source. But you do intrigued me, so with today run I double check not to have any weapon with scope (I have only Plasma rifle with reflex sight) and I'm 100% sure I'll get this event at least once.
---
why say our?   like i said you either meant it as you want to dupe by sending them there are you are a duper. so you are a duper. I understand now.
---
What sucks is that players can force you into PvP now if you have certain mutations. I had someone griefing me for a half an hour before I got so pissed off that I just turned my whole console off. It‚Äôs a stupid and cruel glitch that‚Äôs being exploited with no repercussions and even if you don‚Äôt fight back you still lose both caps and items.
---
I like how you said that like its a loaf of bread baking.
---
This video from WickedyChickady begs to differ: [https://youtu.be/izd5Esf093I?t=322](https://youtu.be/izd5Esf093I?t=322)
---
I do the event 4 times every day, I bet it spawns for you once a week when you accidentally pick one up.
---
You said i was wrong with no proof.
---
They won't be dead until they slighty annoy or inconvinience me me at least
---
I feel like this is a special case. You cant necessarily group everyone together and say they're all bad because that's just not correct.
---
I go through Whitesprings.
---
If you are in a party I think the whole party should carry the wanted status. That'd be an easy fix.
---
You should also know when you get an invite if the party you are joining is wanted.
---
If someone does something and gets wanted status, you should have a 30-60 second window during which you can drop group and not be wanted (to prevent that sort of griefing)
---
Hello from 5 months in the future, for anyone else stumbling on this post for the current daily, I can confirm that a radscorpion does sometimes spawn under the tower but it's usually just one by itself.
---
Same, there are times that people pop up with the VC icon and I think to myself "nah can't be bothered".
---
WR is the most bugged feature in this game. I have only one weapon that‚Äôs properly programmed, so that all the mods are calculated as well. A bloodied gamma gun after deep dish and repeater and grip mods still weigh only 1 unit because it has the 90% WR feature. All other WR weapons were programmed by elementary school kids. ‚ÄòHidden mods‚Äô add weights lmao üòÇ
---
I'm looking for a weightless one for my farenheight 451 display, not to use it lolol
---
I avoid PvP altogether. I don‚Äôt pay attention enough to know what current schemes and tricks are being used to bait players into losing more than they bargained for. I‚Äôve seen pvp used to wipe out everyone at an SBQ, so I just keep pacifist on permanently.
---
And as a heavy weapons user myself, why the hell are you not picking up every single weapon in sight to scrap into ammo?
---
You bet it why? Where did you find info about it? There is one random event when some robot asks you to mark critters for him with recon scope - I get it too, even though I don't have any scoped weapons and can't finish that... Please, link me some source...
---
Yep, I add stimpacks for 5 caps and have a sign that says "take what you need, leave what you dont" and sometimes level 100+ will clean it out...but that doesnt happen too often, thank god.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
I can include my strategy for surviving the damage from pylons.
---
Hoard a lot of nuka colas, cherries etc.
---
Use Cola nut perk and drink colas regularly. You can even survive a direct blast from ISSs laser whilst taking damage and healing through it.
---
You can try that as well.
---
Since I don't have the correct build for it, I wouldn't try your strategy for the next few months. But thank you for sharing.
---
You say to... "*try gaining any amount of XP*" as in cooking something? this would generate XP or so something else?
---
Datamine from a *REALLY* long time ago. Like February-ish
---
I have iron extractor in camp, don't know what to do with steel...
---
I definitely feel that! I also have the Speed Demon mutation.
---
I'm not into censorship. 
---
Free information is free.
---
Yes; right now you'll get 40's and 45's... bright side is 45 is max on *some* weapons.
---
The most recent official information (from QuakeCon) is that a November release is the target, but there has been no news since then. At the moment, it is hard to tell anything more helpful than that, without access to insider information.
---
Exactly. It's the more "humanness" of talking to someone and not just being spoken to.
---
That will be so scary for a PvP player armed with an AA/E Tesla rifle. It could be a hit squad of scorchbeasts and the player would wipe them out in 10 seconds.
---
You know 1 assault rifle makes more steel than that extractor can hold?  Do you even "lucky hole?
---
Then you've missed my point
---
The arms have NO Effect on Ore Mining, you don't even need them equiped, so Arm mods are irrelevant.  As are Torso mods, as we use different ones.
---
The sole thing that effects whether you mine 1 or 4 Ore per click is that you have the Excavator Torso equiped, nothing more.
---
Yes the description says "with both arms equiped" but that is not the case, it's just the Torso required.
---
Not more, exactly the same - 20 scraps. What is lucky hole?
---
As far as I know, yes, you need to be level 50 to get max level items. If all you want is a Handmade and you'd scrip anything else anyway, you can start doing this now, as the max level of the Handmade (and some other weapons) is 45.
---
thanks for sharing this!
---
The HUD color, the sound of my favorite railway rifle and the noises from a nuke zone all give me a screaming migraine. I can‚Äôt run through a nuke zone unless I turn the volume all the way down and that means I can‚Äôt hear bloated gouls sneaking up on me. Drives me crazy
---
 Im pretty certain the respawn is like 1/2 hours. I farm the whole map for supplies, by the time im done i can do the route again if i want.
---
Lucky hole mine produces about 600 lead in 5 minutes time. With that much lead, you vacuum up every piece of steal in sight.
---
I once gave a guy soup.
---
Killing an enemy, cooking, anything that would earn you 1 XP or more.
---
Amber. I need my amber UI or else its not a Fallout game.
---
If you still need help this afternoon,I'll do it .there is one challenge where you have to revive someone under water as well
---
RifleGaming has done builds similar to this, just with people putting their CAMPs next to each other.
---
hey i can help you later today im in the est time zone so dont get home till 6pm though
---
You can't have an effect on the world right now. You can have an effect on humans. Hopefully
---
Gonna be lots of encumbered folks tomorrow
---
I've barely touched it also im still at far harbor in my playthrough and tbh I've gotten tired of it, I prefer point lookout from fallout 3 tbh. And my build isn't great in fo4 so that could be why I don't enjoy it as much
---
I don't need that much lead, I don't even own Excavator PA, I just collect lead taking Rat Poison whenever I see it, for that occasional U .50 ammo crafting is more than enough for me. I currently have 5k 5 mm and 56k+ Ultracite .50 cal ammo.
---
TBF it's one of the most fun things to do in the game right now. Even better, the scrap robot had an insane amount of health, but it can be damaged like any of the other patroltron type of robots. A high enough house on a tall mountain has some fun results.
---
Kinda morbidly funny when after you launch him, and he respawns back at your camp with his legs broken and he is crawling around with his arms, or his head is exploded. There is no cost to killing him either. Killing your bramin requires one steel and one razorgrain to repair, but it rag dolls thru the air.
---
Oh it's really intimidating and I feel like I'm way behind in the game. I apparently have a few dlcs, idk how, and started playing summerset and it was pretty good but Jesus can I not really kill anything!
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Event:_Distant_Thunder
---
That proof you asked for.
---
Count me in.
---
I have checked the local copy of the .esm and there is no link between the levelled list that contains the plasma grenade plan and the levelled list that determines what can be 'found' in those crates.
---
Said that when the whole debacle occurred with melee weapons all dropping 50% Limb damage/+1 AGI there was nothing in the local copy of the .esm that would explain that behaviour yet it was glaringly obvious that it was happening anyway.
---
I surmise that the devs fuckarse around with stuff server side because this is not the only instance.
---
Another instance was 'back in the day' with the Handmade plan. According to the local copy of the .esm it was impossible for the Watoga Train Station vendor to have it yet it bought it from him twice.
---
These two instances are not 'I heard from a friend that it happened to a cousin third-removed of his brother in law', these are first hand accounts.
---
So, in summary, the devs can and do fuckarse around with stuff server-side.
---
Corn or Razorgrain though?
---
Thanks. I guess i'll put in some hours before  the weekend.
---
AOE damage from mutations and Tesla mods no longer count as an attack or counterattack to a player not engaged in PVP.
---
That was taken out some time during Wild Appalachia, I believe.
---
These have been happening for months especially the 1st and 5th from my understanding they are trying to fix it in the following updates.
---
Ok awesome... I'll try this later today and report back. Hopefully this helps! 
---
One other question: So if I didn't do this last night before logging off does that mean the "New Level" or XP earned last night for Adventure mode will be lost?
---
Yup, same here.
---
There is literally no word about requirements to have weapon with recon scope to trigger the quest.
---
+1. I always change it to like a soft blue.
---
He was on about after wastelanders comes out in theory there shouldnt be a SBQ anymore since we kill her as part of the main quest
---
At the bottom, finish reading before commenting.
---
Exactly. To have EVERY "rescue" end in, "Well, these guys are all dead, too" gets a bit tedious.
---
Currently on a replay of Fallout 4, I would say it is a combination of missing things: "living" NPCs (be it humans, non-feral ghouls, or even just more than a few robots that are well developed characters), dialogue and choices, and the ability to have any lasting impact on the world. Although the latter is hard to change in a major way without private servers, where the player can return to the same world.
---
Damn... pretty clever work around! Too bad I have no friends üò™
---
Great job. You are literally no ones heroü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Until robota can be programmed to suffer why should we help them and put ourselfves in harms way?
---
It only mention, that "it can be completed using any recon scope", not that it won't trigger when you have one equipped.
---
Umdraco.
---
Umdraco
---
Thanks for posting this. This'll make those challenges so much simpler lol
---
It should still be there for ya when you log in! If earning XP in Adventure doesn't trigger the level up then that's a bug and I'll speak with the team about it. Please let me know what happens!
---
Until they'll patch it ;)
---
Not sure about that, that's up to the quest designers and art team but I can give that feedback to them. We'll learn more when we get closer to another Fashnacht. :)
---
Hey, Happy to hear I inspired you, Im quite flattered, as for your build it is pretty good, though here are a few tips for it:  
---
\- Instead of having weapon stat boost cards maxed out, you can leave them at one as one of each is a 30% boost instead of a single maxed out card which is only 20%, just keeps you open for other useful perks like Blocker, given your up close at times, and Incisor the reason being you'll be doing so much damage either way, you don't need that much put into damage cards, leaving you open for the utility of other perk cards.  
---
\- With Crack shot, Im not too familiar with this one, never really used it, but with the Gamma gun, it already has quite the range on it, with a slow projectile it may be harder to hit your target from a rather far range, but again, im not sure, I haven't used the card so it may work great, though having at least 3-4 in perception is always good for picklocking  
---
\- Endurance is good, Radicool is a must and Ironclad is a good substitute to Rad Resist, a little extra damage resist and energy resist goes a long way, or at least I think it is lol. I chose rad resist because my biggest problem is usually charred ghouls and there insane hits with rad damage, so it's also a personal touch for myself hah. and with my build, I Haven't tested it fully in the field so it is subject to change  
---
\-Overly Generous, completely missed that card when looking through the list, i'll have to keep that in mind, plus as TiggsStoneHeart mentioned, sharing ghoulish and rad sponge is a good idea for team play, so if your playing with your buddy, it's always a nice pick up.  
---
\-Int wise, I always clock at least 5 in mostly so I can craft high level melee and ranged weps, so keep that in mind if you choose to roll with low int  
---
\-Agility fallows the same thing with strength, having just 3 one point cards of raw damage keeps you open for more options like sneak, light footed, etc, etc, whatever fits your play style. Never Tried dodgy so dunno how to put my opinion on it, though with stuff like Serendipity, it does that job a lot better, given you'll be low health and high rads it has a higher chance to proc without loosing your ap, which you may need for a quick escape or vats.  
---
\-Luck is fine, I roll with that either way  
---
Well I hope all that info helped, have fun and praise Atom my fellow disciple
---
5k HW ammo is a joke. Who dosen't need more ammo? But just go around telling people, who are trying to help others, that you think they are wrong with no reason other than you think so.
---
Definitely.
---
Same to me as well I usually sell 2-1 star weapons for abt 1250 caps depending on the legendary effect and some armor and junk and alot of stuff for some cheap caps and most people buy it and I usually get alot of friend requests from it or adding me so they can come back tmrw when they have the caps or bring their friend along to buy it for them it's a nice community
---
You could also say this was a pre-war movie set to explain the "false front" nature of some of the buildings... You could add (though I doubt you have budget space) the Atom Shop camper/trailer as the star's on-site residence...
---
&gt; Man up and go kill the person you have a problem with.
---
But you can't unless they are wanted... Which they will never be.
---
There is literally no source that can prove you have to have weapon with recon scope to start the event, really...
---
I'm a wizard. Hufflepuff.
---
JK I'm a wastelander and post-apocalyptic larper.
---
all I require is that my map markers isnt the same as my teammates. incredibly frustrating to realize youve been walking towards your friends map marker that they forgot to remove instead of the one you placed.
---
Fair point - I understand what you're saying here, and this could well justify why I, in a few hundred hours or so, never managed to come across it.
---
So in conclusion, at the time of this writing you're saying that it is technically, supposedly, not possible to get it based on local .esm file analysis. Did I get this right? If so, I will make an edit to my post and point that out.
---
Both the legendary issue and handmade issues were obvious in the esm. The legendary list melee weapons were pulling from during the limb damage issue lacked other 2 star effects, so it always defaulted to limb damage. The handmade plan issue was that it didn't appear after a certain level, not that it didn't appear at all, which was later fixed.
---
Thank you Dr.
---
I experienced all these lately too, along with the bug where you almost kill something and it gains it's health back half way
---
I tend to have the best luck when I just pick a road and wonder. I usually start at Huntersville and loop around to westek and ride that up north.  
---
If I'm fast traveling I'll do Whitesprings, Huntersville, Westek, Robco, Generals Steakhouse. Hoard Events too.
---
I'm jealous. I love the lever action rifle. I found a nice instigating with fire rate increase, which is a decent one. But TSE would be way better.
---
I can do it in 15 minutes. I just need one rad-x and a space to drop from. I'll send you invite when I am online. But reply if you received some help already.
---
I bought the pestilence power armor, or whatever it's name is, just so I could be a Nurgle space marine. It was a good purchase.
---
&gt; since I need them to get challenge (kill 76 wanted players)
---
^
---
Well the "Rider" PA set looks Chaos Marine, more so if you mix and match.
---
I LOVE IT!
---
Holy... wow!!! This is incredible!!!

I can reliably trigger the event multiple times per hour server hopping. How long do you figure you would have to play without any chance of having a recon scope in inventory, without seeing it trigger to know for sure?
---
I'll live
---
Is the legendary system based on 1 character or you overall between all the characters? Ive heard mixed things lol. I know its supposed to be every 50 levels you get a perk or something like that. I have different builds, cant bring myself to stay on one person lol, when so many different builds are fun. For example my bloodied melee is like level 120/130 but hes the sports car that only gets taken out for special moments like meatweek lol. ATM im using my level 135 commando the most, 120 pistol, 125 mix rifle, and my newest level 40 shotgun that i deleted a level 80 trainwreck for. Just wondering if its combined or if the people will get their own?
---
Ok will do thanks for the assistance! I'll report back once I've tested this...
---
There are ppl that have really bad headaches from certain colors. Piss yrllow and lime please, bartender!
---
Agreed. Never played or remotely been interest in BR before but I love Nuclear Winter. It's really good, tense fun.
---
Ahh kk. Poor dude got downvoted üòíüòí I was just confused to what he meant
---
Kill em all and let god sort em out!
---
Take my upvote. If I could give more, I would.
---
Thank you for this! I had a feeling West-Tek and Huntersville might still be good spots to farm, but I tried Huntersville like 4/5 times a few days ago and couldn't get any legendaries to spawn. Just normal enemies. Maybe they've nerfed specific areas too?
---
I have a instigating explosive prime shotgun, Furious prime fixer and instigating explosive hunting rifle i roll with at all times.  I love me some furious
---
I spam Encryptid events for my legendaries. This is a v expensive process though, so I know not everyone can do it. I have no problem scripping out every day
---
Seemed intelligible to me. I think the word you're looking for is belligerent.
---
Yeah people are very quick to downvote but reserve upvotes for only the best of the best
---
Aight, cool, thanks.  I've really never collected anything other than steel and lead. Felt like i always  had enough scrap to carry through. But after 256 levels my priorities have changed :)
---
So the issue is that there is a junk item and an aid item both called royal jelly. The aid item is used for the recipe while the junk just gets scrapped. I believe honey beasts can drop both but HEAVILY favors the junk one. Their is a world spawn for the aid one in the basket behind MMC and in a bathtub at tanagra town.
---
Please tell me you also have the Plague Carrier mutation,
---
Typically when people see the event on the map your gonna get a lot of visitors. Everyone likes the rewards so just launch the event. Maybe server hop till you see more players In that server.
---
Hard to say. Seems like half the time for any of those spots there are no legendaries, the other half I can find 2 or 3. Huntersville has never been more than one though.
---
I'm about level 32. My best gear is a speedy hunting rifle and raider PA w/ some 51-B parts. Sorry for the late reply I got busy with school.
---
Clearly
---
I would love to have something like that.
---
Floopwood is too much of a hassle to move, but good luck trying to find a server where your camp is free haha
---
This is the first time I heard of this, thank you.
---
Information works for everyone including those who would now be ready against griefer tactics.
---
I do! Also the shock one, although as far as I can tell neither are very useful in general. They're still fun to have though, and every once in a while it does kill a lowly ghoul or molerats for me.
---
Nuclear Winter is the most stable part of the game, and was immediately successful from launch. They absolutely should not drop it, they've already dropped Survival Mode. I personally think they should make Nuclear Winter free to play (not the whole game, just NW) to get more people playing. Don't get me wrong, I love Adventure Mode. I've played over 800 hours and still play daily. The Fallout76 community is hugely varied and love this game for different reasons. Just because YOU think something is a waste of time doesn't mean everyone else does.
---
What an original joke
---
It‚Äôs best to get a feel for the other players on your server. A bunch of people showed up and killed the scorchbeast queen in a couple minutes? That‚Äôs probably a good server. Big turn out for Project Paradise? Another good one.
---
0.01% drop chance... yeah that's pretty rare.
---
Oh good gods, give your cringey moralism a rest.
---
I would assume it‚Äôs per character so for example your melee, commando, pistol, and mix rifle characters would receive two special perks while the trainwreck would‚Äôve received 1.  I doubt it will get as intricate as having multiple options for perks, but if you want to choose perception for your commando and agility for your pistol, I don‚Äôt see that being out of reach.
---
Not unless they come over mic and ask to be killed because they did something silly. Rest of the time I avoid it as others have said its most likely a trap.
---
They're becoming my hero in this thread.
---
Oh good god, give your crying a restüò¢
---
First I was amazed - how did you fit so many buildings into the budget??? But then I noticed interior is empty/half empty. That is sad... Good job, just hope you had more budget for the interior.
---
I have my own suburb lane camp with only 4 buildings (shop, autorepair, armory, guest house) and the interior is not completely finished due to budget. It's not empty or even half empty, but didn't fit all I have planned.
---
I had 6 building before, but they were half empty, so I decided to scrap the power plant and farmhouse for more interior.
---
My PC IGN is SeriWolk in case someone asks and want to see. I'm planning to upload a video someday, when I'm not lazy :P
---
P.S. my friend also has a lane camp on the same road about 100m away from me =) He has a restaurant, comic-book store and shop. His buildings are bigger than mine, my 4 buildings are only 2x2.
---
Your life must be that pathetic.
---
Im a junk dealer on ps4 so its pretty much all i do lol, glad i could help.
---
My 3 main places to get legendaries are Westtek, Whitespring, and the Charleston Capital building.
---
 I always try to do the horde events since they always have a 3 star enemy but sometimes it breaks and the place check counter overflows.
---
 Another event is the Leader of The Pack, but it gives 3 legendaries that are only 1 star.
---
Oh, looks like another redditor with a lack of self awareness.
---
Can I sell legendaries to the purveyor?
---
I really wanna be able to ~~imprison~~ have some settlers in my camp. Would make the annoying 'cant remove this because it becomes inaccessable' thing worth it
---
I usually play 4-5 hours a day and do this quest 3-4 times a day. I repeat it again - I have only one weapon that can have scope, not recon though (plasma rifle). The rest are BE Gatling plasma, 2x 50 Cals, Gatling gun and Black powder pistol. I don't pick up weapons to scrap. I'll double check it Today and if I couldn't trigger the event during the session I apologize you. But right now I see no reason to believe you, sorry.
---
I think it will be amazing. More tools like ProSnap, drill, maybe using sledgehammer for something else than skull crushing.
---
Biv: "...I mean, how do you measure luck!?"
---
Says the person losing their shit over someone mentioning very basic game mechanics.   You know that info could be useful to prepare those against griefers as well.
---
No, it has a 0.058% chance to drop from Ash Heap events. It's the ***pulse*** grenade plan that drops from explosive crates.
---
Huh, look like I'll need to use that workshop up north to farm up some acid then.
---
No. You can sell them to the scrip machine outside train stations, including the one at Berkley.
---
&gt;Oh, looks like another redditor with a lack of self awareness
---
Yes... i know. Are you unware of your own advice? Or are you the typical redditor that likes to show up late to a thread in a feeble attempt so assert some kind of insult to make yourself feel like you did some worth?
---
I've tried lately to go after wanted players but... the way pvp in this game works it's just not fucking fun most of the time.  
---
Call me a coward but since I don't have a specialized pvp build when I go after someone I sneak up, get myself in a nice position and slap on a piece of chameleon gear and take them out at a distance using my bloodied sniper build.  A fraction of the time this works but that's usually up against people who probably got the wanted status accidentally and weren't actually looking for pvp.  But the majority of the time?  If you can't one shot someone you're fucked, because the instant you land a hit they spam a stimpak.  If they ever manage to apply NW style healing to pvp situations it might be worth the time, but beyond that you're too likely to end up against someone that's just eager to teabag your corpse because you couldn't deal with their infinite health.
---
Its more dialogue choices I think that people are looking forward to. Putting more RPG elements in 76 will make for a better game I feel. I liked Rose as well, but I would have liked a few dialogue options with her when I talk to her. For example if I wanted to roleplay as a Responder, it would have been nice to tell her to go to hell.
---
I came into possession of a Vampire‚Äôs Faster Fire Rate Plasma Flamer the other day and I'm waiting to stack enough ammo (I primed it for the damage boost but Ultracite Plasma Cartridges are easily the most expensive ammo to craft) to take on Imposter. My health doesn't seem to drop when using it but I wanna test to the max by tanking the pylons and the IS.
---
And there is an exchange limit of 150 scrip per day.
---
Yet another non-sequitur response by you.
---
Oh you can see emotions in text? Wow you are a reddit super userüòíü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I'm on PS4, so hotkeying anything else is a royal pain. I'd love to be able to swill Cherry, etc. but can't w/o going into the pip boy or the radial menu (and right now the radials are kinda messed up on PS4 - rough to use mid-intense-fight)
---
I'll see what I can do there though!
---
Yeah, I meant no chance to drop from the crates. Ok, thanks.
---
And another... nothing from you
---
We'll just have to wait and see, the video game gods will probably need a sacrifice to make it work right tho lol. But absolutly, i wouldnt do it any other way, just heard so many mixed things it left some questions. Thanks for the input!
---
Yeah and it's funny everytime fella
---
But that's the whole problem here. I tried to help the op, and you call me out as wrong with zero proof. Then you call me out for not having the proof of some thing I read some where a year ago. I find a link in the official wiki that says you can do it with any recon scope, not good enough. It is fine if you dont believe me, but to say I am wrong with zero proof is a stretch.
---
Are you saying you don't know how to communicate basic emotions through verbal language? Wow, must be a confusing world for you.
---
Yeah thats it. Says the guy who is providing nothing
---
I suppose you'd need to improve your literacy to understand the mechanics of what you're saying. Maybe a course in logic as well.
---
Well, I asked eckserah when it was happening and he said that in fact it wasn't happening and there wasn't anything in the .esm to indicate it and it was all in my head - regarding the melee weapons that is.
---
Don't take my word for it, I can probably find it in the discord log.
---
The handmade plan one I checked myself, it was level gated and linked to the container of the Free States vendor alone.
---
Oh my god! 800 pound stash!!!!!
---
M Night Shamalamadingdong Plot Twist: The NPCs are actually bethesda employees sitting in a dark room 24 hours a day roleplaying as the NPCs
---
These all sound great. I guess I‚Äôm going to have to read through the patch notes.
---
If anything Fallout 76 should reveal how little choice you ever had with Bethesda dialogue.
---
Even after they add dialogue with human NPCs you will still be left doing the exact same thing you are doing now after you burn through the content. They can't add meaningful consequences because everyone will be choosing different paths in a single game world.
---
What you guys are asking for cannot exist in this game.
---
You wanted me to read carefully, but you do otherwise - in Wiki it's a note that said that at the begining you had to have special BoS hunting rifle to be able to Mark enemies with it, while later they've changed it to be able to use any recon scoped weapon. There is no word there you have to have recon scoped weapon to trigger the event on the map.
---
Is that why you helped people in FO4/Fo3? Because you didn‚Äôt want these humans to suffer?
---
Thanks - that was my motivation. I had been joining when I saw it, and those are largely successful, but way chaotic. I'd noticed my scout sentinel also had 3 Troubleshooter and thought ... now is the time. I wasn't taking much damage anyway, but still stimming through. 
---
Knowing I can solo carry the event is nice. Kinda like when I first got good enough to do the silos alone - seems so far away.
---
I need to work on the queen. I \*think\* I could solo her on some of my builds, and thankfully the death mecahnic isn't so bad - but I do worry about the adds and aggravation. I'd hate to have to use the vamp weapon though - leaving that damage behind would be unfortunate.
---
The one you found is one of two drops for the correct Royal Jelly...the other is the on top of Taranga Town. Honey Beasts still only drop the wrong one...aka the Junk one. Unless that was changed very recently, they still only drop that one.
---
You need to find a group online or grab some friends. Do NOT trust randoms with this. You might get some jerks who one-shot legendaries, you might get some noobs who don't know what to do, you might get bloodied builds who physically can't grab pylons
---
I agree dialogue will be an improvement. It‚Äôs more of a nice to have in my opinion. The human element seems pretty irrelevant though still. I am glad others are happy though. I am most excited to see what the new main quests involve. I hope future DLC adds more areas to explore.
---
why are you not in pacifist mode?
---
basically apply a similar set of limitations that the foundations have, where minimum 20% must be above ground
---
Yeah pretty sure you'll be fine. I was using a 1\* Vampire, not even FFR. Of course I was running Troubleshooter and Sentinel, so that's some mitigation right there.
---
Ok this is true but this extremely specific type of griefing isn't what he asked about.
---
Being a jerk 101. Condescension + Sarcasm.
---
And max scrip is 1000, be careful scripping when you're above 950 ish.
---
This looks fantastic! Love the back-lot scenes too ;-)
---
They actually said there will be consequence and certain areas will be instanced. I have no idea how they will make it work, but that is what they are promising.
---
Me personally I'm partially colorblind, so not being able to change the color makes the game much more difficult.
---
I plant legendary razorgrain and legendary muttfruits, early to rise and make sure to have music playing for the crops.
---
thank you for asking this question!  
---
and thank you to Valseek for the clarification!
---
I see Distant Thunder on the map several times a day if I'm on long enough for it to reoccur and I don't regularly carry any recon scope weapons or binoculars in my inventory. 
---
One of my main characters has a recon scope gauss that's usually in their stash. I don't see Distant Thunder more frequently on that characters, whether it's in the stash or in the character's inventory.
---
Instanced means you are not having a meaningful impact on the game world. Think about it.
---
Most people rejected His message.
---
They hated u/rhill107 because He told them the truth.
---
I have done once, only because I could fast travel near him and he was a lower level character. Killed him once and left. However, I was online with my SO and we had 2 people try and take Poseidon from us, so we fast travelled and ended up PVPing for about an hour, they learnt after a while that it was going badly for them and realised we weren't giving it up so easily. She earned about 1000 caps from that and I made a similar amount. Not many people can take a sledgehammer to the back of the head too well!
---
Here's my build to have a look at, average about 25k per swing, but full hulk mode with revenant, nuka shine and max adrenal reaction can go north of 50k. 
---
The Build https://imgur.com/a/xB5uYzL
---
The trick is finding the butter zone of killing her quick and leaving enough meat on the bone so everyone gets loot, I find I don't get many complaints if I leave 50% of her regen'ed health.
---

---
‚ÄòOnly for basic weapon‚Äô is poor excuse for lousy programmers, many of my basic weapons still weigh a ton üòÇ
---
Downvoted for the truth.
---
You'll get a notification when you're gonna scrip an item that will put you at 1k scrip as well! Was pleasantly surprised to see that addition
---
I have been wanted since yesterday and the only time anyone attempted to kill me was while I was loading in at Whitesprings station after server hopping. I ended up (very sloppily) winning the 2 vs 1 match but they logged off afterwards, which is weird cause they attacked me so its not like I was griefing them.. They didn't even respawn.
---
Coming.
---
Yea me too which is why I don't understand why I've been wanted for 3 hours of play time lol
---
Yeah that troubleshooters will make a world of difference, some of that pure damage mitigation. If I had the stash space on my main i'd create a set just for the event.
---
Jump in an event and revive someone there, that's how i did mine in a blast zone while they caught a queen scorch beast
---
Yeah, but I used to click too fast (when selling for caps) and did not notice the notification. I lost out on some caps back in the day vendoring stuff. No big deal but losing out on 40 scrip because you missed the warning...lol 
---
ow.
---
I think that's illegal
---
Luck points only affect the durability bar size and double repair of found weapons and armor. It's been a myth since release day. I'm an Unyielding build with 30 Luck, and I don't get better chances at Purveyor or better items I want. It's just Durability bar and Double repair.
---
He got downvoted because hes wrong. The devs have stated that there will still scorched and scorchbeasts
---
I feel you. It's more of the problem with rifles, since it's the only weapons in the game that hasn't got any weight reduction perks to help with 25+ lbs handmades...
---
Is it hard for someone to jump in and play around with blockchain like BigChainDb? I've got decent amount of experience programming (mostly python and powershell and bash) and working with databases but none with blockchain, I might look into playing around with it. Any suggestions on where to start?
---
Repost
---
Exactly.  I love it.
---
I feel like it'd be great for people who seriously use their vending machines, but I doubt it'll get the same attention as Meat Week overall. That was every hour, 24 hours a day, for a week, versus here you'll spend 1000 scrip, get 150 back and spend that, and then come back the next 2 days for the other 300 scrip, maybe like 5 minutes at Berkeley each time.
---
I thought the marine was in the beta and some consol players had it too. Might be wrong tho
---
I love the way it works in both of those modes, NW and the raids. Whenever the daily is ‚Äúrevive an ally‚Äù we just go into the raid. I don‚Äôt think it would be game breaking if we always went into the down state before death, but perhaps there‚Äôs something about that I‚Äôm missing that would cause problems
---
They‚Äôre not explained but there seems to be a damage threshold. If you take damage while bleeding out it can also kill you. Big hits will sometimes just throw you immediately to dead. 
---
In the Vault raids instadeath and lifesaving perks/equipment are disabled.
---
Running smooth though, or that a bit of a stretch?
---
Dont razz me, I need to know!
---
My internet sucks and it runs smooth. Just like an offline game
---
I've also run into invincible enemies. That shit is frustrating.
---
Bicycle? Are you a commie or just too young to be driving an automobile?
---
i imagine it'll be like the art/art encounter or the diamond city showdown in fo4.  still nice to choose tho, but it seems unlikely there will be permanence or consistency (rlly doubt they'll track the # of times player choose A over B, etc)
---
Haha true dat. I just heard lots of bad stuff about it. Even on this sub. Figured it died out
---
been playing them since the second week so my intro to them was hell, once i learned how to do them completely and practiced they seemed too easy for me and my group.
---

My understanding is that one way to dupe items (in general) involves causing the server to lag then exploit the lag.  So if you see massive lag that can be an indicator of active duping.  I know people have used that and other clues to hunt dupers and catch them and sometimes steal their items.  In any case its jerks being jerks.
---
It could mean that some areas you will no longer be able to access.  That‚Äôs easy enough to do.
---
It's the same as you were playing. People overplay the disconnect and bug card.
---
Sometimes it feels like there's not much to do, but if you're able to make it your own game, it's incredibly fun. Almost a year later I still find something to do in 76 nearly every day.
---
Can we revive him so I too can execute him?
---
I had a super sledge with the reduced weight and the speed swing increase and it was the best melee weapon I've had so far.
---
I love falling victim to traps because when they kill me they get absolutely nothing. No caps (at least not from me since I never have any) and no loot.
---
1 atom for each point in each RGB seems fair to me. So if you want a specific color you pay like this:
---
R: 145 Atoms
---
G: 255 Atoms
---
B: 133 Atoms
---
And after you paid, it is one atom for each point you add or remove.
---
There were zero cool missions, there were zero cool dialogues, and not a single cool character. There's so much limitation when trying to tell a story with ones and zeros. Every mission was just go here and attempt something that all these other people died trying to do. And then the bad part is it's not even a challenge after level 50 all enemies are one-tap. The game is boring and stale without "NPCs" and don't try to say robots are NPCs because they're not. NPCs give meaning to games, you complete missions to help someone whos unable to, or out of greed for money or info. After level 120+ the game was nothing more than legendary farming. And some actual characters could definitely freshen up the game.
---
Not of it is instanced. It is in a different, seperate space that isn't interacted with by the whole of the world.
---
I would go check out neighborhoods of player houses in any mmorpg to see how meaningful any personal instancing is going to end up.
---
It is purely an illusion and cannot have any actual impact on the game world we are all playing in
---
Actually there was something in the esm to explain it and it's the same with the mystery pick which is why it got pulled. When they added the purveyor they added a new record type called LGDI. This record had lists of the legendary effects that you could get as drops and what item they applied to. When they changed how legendary drops from enemies worked they added a record to this list that didn't have any 2 star legendaries for melee except limb damage. This list also only had +1 agi and weightless as the one 3 star effects for melee and still has those at this moment.
---
Last night some Level 200+ lured two scorched beast  (one was a diseased I think) to my camp. Got nearly completely destroyed and did not help repair anything. Spent the rest evening looking for all the items I need to repair my place.

A couple pieces of advise for Pvp: Bloodied is a horrible choice in PvP right now. You can't 1 shot someone anymore. They removed the possibility from the game. On top of that the maximum amount of damage you can do to anyone is 110. So if you can hit a scorch beast queen for 25,000, you still hit a player for 110. So the slowness of a sniper rifle on top of a damage cap is no good at all. You need automatic weapons, and instead of explosive, faster fire rate is the new king. Sniping from afar is not an option. I sparked PvP with someone yesterday and they pulled out a dragon. I almost tried to stop them for their own good lol. Oh well.
---
We were never meant to be.
---
Nice job!  I would love to visit.
---
I am apparently not doing phrasing today
---
In the mire there is a spot where 1-2 wendigo drop from a tree. Server hop and within 30 minutes you should have 100 screws.
---
Good game, still needs fixing, great fun anyways, quite more complete than release. You have days with three server disconnects in two hours and weeks with no problems.
---
It‚Äôs okay, our love can be forbidden.
---
Okay, but what impact on the world does that have other than dividing the player base?
---
Hope is the first step on the path to disappointment.
---
Zero cool missions? Really? I thought mistress of mysteries was pretty cool. Also really liked the sheepsquatch questline. And robots are NPCs. Look up the definition of NPC. You are not asking for an NPC, you are asking for something else. How is rose not an NPC? Lol. Just because you don‚Äôt care about her, doesn‚Äôt mean she isn‚Äôt an NPC lol.
---
Oof. I got it from uranium fever not too long ago so I can confirm they still drop
---
Blue body (Vault Tek) and a red helmet looks ultramarine-ish. Or the white excavator helmet ;-)
---
I had that problem for a while and it was driving me insane but clearing my cache and doing a hard reset of my console fixed it, hasn‚Äôt happened in months now. (XboxOne)
---
This game still has a vast amount of bugs and glitches still but the devs have patched some of that but no where near a glitch less game,
---
The frames are still fairly bad sometimes but other times they‚Äôre okay
---
I think the new updates are worth jumping back in for however there isn‚Äôt a whole lot of new things from updates but it can be fun to play if you can deal with the frustration that this game also brings with it
---
Went and bought ssd hopefully it will fix it and load times will be shorter.
---
It would be just for the character that was being restricted.  Another character you make could still be able to access said area.  The area could be a faction base.  Access is granted to one area while restricted from another.  Simple consequence that is doable from the mmo perspective.
---

Should. But if you want easy acid, head over to tanagara town.

Reddit is "news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion." That doesn't sound like social media to me.

Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat are a whole other ball game.

Glad to help :)  I love the game, but I can't claim it's perfect when it's not.  Some people give it a bit too much hate, and some maybe too much love.  The truth is usually in the middle.
---
But what about smokin' those meats?
---
Yeah ive experienced 1 and 4 and i dobt if its a hug or a feature but whenever i pull out my heatcoiled super sledge it emits a static sound
---
I think it only works on ore.
---
Literally my thought process when writing that

Happened to me at first. Yeah, you actually have to go and "use" them to learn them. Don't worry, a lot of us had the same sudden realisation.
---
thanks
---
Dude just buy an external drive for $40
---
5.56
---
I would think 5.56 and 50 Cal
---
Thanks for the quick responses, that's unfortunate, was really hoping to see how they affected as well to see which ones are worth looking out for
---
5.56 always sells very well
---
Sort of what I was thinking, but I was surprised that it remained on the server for the whole time I was logged in.
---
so if you go super fast killing all the regualr enemies, great, but how could it hurt to wait 5 extra seconds to let other tag the legendary?
---
It just seems like you are gonna make a lot of people hate you every time to oneshot the legendary, because random people in game arent gonna know WHY you are one shotting the boss, they will just think you are a @#$#@$4 ahole
---
Actually this would be awesome. Great idea.
---
So ... all of the HUD and UI are defined in Flash SWF files, and sad to say, the colors are baked into the image shape definitions and text placement records and in some places even the ActionScript code.
---
I know this because shortly after release I made a Green UI mod making FO76 reminiscent of FO3.
---
Unfortunately, with each release the SWF files are updated, and as it takes several hours to manual re-edit the new versions of the files, gave up on it after about release 8.
---
Maybe some modded has better Flash editing software than I have and can figure out some way to automatically re-apply the same changes on every release, but short of that I don‚Äôt see any easy way to create a blue HUD and have it remain working.
---
OTOH, if you really do only mean the HUD, not the entire UI and Pip-Boy, that‚Äôs only a single file, two if you include some of the extra overlay text..
---
What RGB blue did you have in mind?
---
I had taken on at *least* five to ten SBQs before beating Belly of the Beast, so that would have to have been a more recent change.
---
I got out of it to help my hubby. Should have stayed in pacifist mode.
---
POWER ARMOR JET PACK BUG. I need this one fixed. If you jump you get stuck about 2 inches off the ground and your AP drains, then you hit the ground as if you've jumped off a cliff. Either that or it literally launches you into orbit.
---
Some weapons mods numbers are inaccurate by the way. The pipe pistol and syringer are just two examples.
---
this....this is a neat idea
---
id be happy to spend a certain amount of caps a day just to get more people able to fast travel for free to my camp
---
Im sure we would make back our caps with the extra business it brings in!
---
People sell at different prices, so it's hard to say how much a one star weapon goes for. I usually go the route of being willing to pay 100 caps per star for a legendary weapon or armor that I will sell to the scrip machine.
---
A Junk roll is a legendary (armor or weapon) that rolls with modifiers that are not very good for your build or anyone.
---
Example's :
---
Instigating Sniper Rifle with faster fire rate (versus exploding) for a sniper build, or a Furious Handmade with 50% limb damage (versus one with faster fire rate or exploding bullets)
---
Or a Hunters Hunting Rifle with any roll.
---
Those are junk rolls to me because I'm a stealth sniper rifleman, so an Instigating Hunting Rifle with faster Fire rate is a DPS loss vs an Instigating Hunting rifle with exploding rounds, the same comment would go towards The Lever Action Rifle also, from a Sniper's point of View.
---
As to the Furious Handmade, faster fire rate is what I'm looking for, for more DPS
---
In a nutshell (to me), a junk roll is something your own build won't benefit from, and also one that you would have a hard time selling or trading.
---
Other people with different builds might have different views on junk rolls - everyone plays differently.
---
Its cringy to believe that open information is free to share?
---
The bosses are the signal of the next phase. There's four phases. There's seven tiers of rewards. it's not a very big bar, that means each tier only covers a little bit of the bar. The shielded plans don't drop until tier five, and the chances improve the more Uranium you have. I'm gonna let everyone know I'm one-shotting and to please feel free to do the same if they see it. I'll be polite with it lol
---
I miss having my blue his and white pipboy to have a normal light
---
Definitely 5.56. I keep around 100k 5.56 ammo on me with Bandolier, mainly as a currency (they are 1:1 with caps) but also cause I'm using b25 handmade a lot
---
I like the idea but a lot of peoples ideas include legendary effects not working in certain circumstances. I worked really hard for my items and dont wanna be on the same level as someone who just turned level 50 and has hand crafted gear. Otherwise a cool idea.
---
More so for the plans. I don't get the crap plans that I have already read, they are almost always new (for now)
---
And for guns I don't know. I would only get the crap ranged legendary weapons but since I switched I only seem to get legendaries for guns I actually use. No clue how a game would do this hence why I'm putting the question out. Maybe based off the perk cards idk just talking at this point.
---
How. I'm on console.
---
Not sure what you have in mind, but you can edit the HUD overlay as well as the QuickBoy and Terminal colors via .ini edits on PC.

Double info is fine, I do it on accident too. 
---
I knew of Taranga but this one was news to me, haha. I'm glad the community knows
---
5.56, maybe .50 and .45 also
---
Though, with the Fixer now being in the legendary pool .45 will be more used.
---
i did notice some matches were staring with only 30 people lol
---
im ok with that! that just means im that much closer to first place
---
I was given some when I bought the Mechanist Atom Bundle I think, and i stupidly used them all in the vault when I thought you dropped your stuff on death in there ...  not sad i used them up there
---
You'd figure with such an obvious flaw and a well voiced community this would have been fixed 6+ months ago... but...
---
Which INI settings?
---
Yeah, 5.56 - we love our handmade rifles.  5mm and .50cal are popular too, but those can be made in much larger batches more easily than 5.56.
---
With all  the Fixers I see for sale, seems to me like .45 should be getting pretty popular too, if it isn't already.
---
That makes sense. If I were to make a creature like this, it would have to be like the creatures you mentioned and not just a common enemy like a ghoul or a scorched. I would have them be shorchbeasts and the Grafton monster like you said but also fogcrawlers, behemoths, mirklurk kings and queens, deathclaws, and basically all the cryptids in the game. And your right they probably won‚Äôt do this but it‚Äôs just an idea I had that I wanted to share. Thanks for the comment anyway though.
---
leftover image from someones camp who left the server, sorry to ruin the mystique!
---
I‚Äôve had roughly the same experience, hardest part has been getting a consistent group together. Most of our expert runs were accomplished with only 3 players, it‚Äôs not exactly impossible content
---

---
TBH I have 2 characters and one has higher luck than the other and the one that has higher luck actually seems to get worse drops on a constant basis over the last 6 months. I will say the character with higher INT does get weapons that seem to have excellent durability.
---
Man - you should link up with the main game designer who is a huge warhammer fan:

---
Also, I'm excited about the possibility of human NPCs meaning the return of melee kill moves, but I don't truly believe in it.
---
And I‚Äôm not over here using the highest caliber meta weapons and full matching AP refresh armor or anything like that. Anyone who has experience in the vault knows it‚Äôs about team work, communication, preparation, and common sense. You don‚Äôt need 100k caps worth of legendaries to pull it off.
---
Nah mate it's a PC thing, I was just memeing because someone else replied about the ini files even after the post mentions it specifically
---
Mine is explosive + furious + lower weight
---
If you‚Äôre actually into the game then you can sink hundreds of hours into it in order to get the best gear. Some people have a non-legendary Level 50 handmade and complain there‚Äôs no end game besides SBQ

I don't really know any routes, but I would recommend doing horde events. About 75% of the time I do them I get a legendary, and out of that 75% about 50% tends to be 3* legendaries with another 25% for 2* and 25% for 1*
---
This game has kept me playing because of the community.  Yes the game has had issues. But for the most part, the people have been amazing.  I love playing in survivor mode with new characters ( before it left us).   Player would murder me, and then give me gear better gear.

*soft, defeated sobbing*

Get this man some Green!

Buggy. I killed scorchedbeast queen. Luckily looted her asap. And game crashed. I killed so much of other mobs... and didnt get a chance to loot yet...

Mine is both sides.

No I don‚Äôt think so they have official python drivers and examples on the github.

I haven't tried it yet but maybe you need all codes for every silo for this to complete? Thought about that since there are 3 silos and it has 3 completion goals.

Unfortunately, *Green* is the Fallout standard.

I had a very light shade of blue that gave off a very bright light with only a slight blue hue

‚ÄúKind of‚Äù is putting it lightly. r/fallout is one of the most toxic gaming subs I‚Äôve been in, and it‚Äôs only the tip of the iceberg for the fanbase‚Äôs issues. Even on this sub, which is usually better since it‚Äôs focused on a single game and can avoid the typical ‚ÄúX game is better than Y game‚Äù arguments, I‚Äôve seen people get really nasty.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking. I had an alt who never got anything from SBQ. Beat belly of the beast and boom I get loot. This was about 1-2 months ago so it may have changed.
---
I def hope they go ham in completing the pet system, I feel we just have a bit of the framework but def not all of it.
---
It eats budget but placing stuff on rugs helps them sink better.

Quick weapon swapping quit working for me.  When i try to swap i got to unrmed...really annoying
---
How did you get all those super rare masks again?  All of them?  Explain yourself
---
Agreed
---
Maybe, but I think your prices are much too low
---
If you're looking for more foot traffic, I wouldn't worry about moving to Berkley Springs. Move closer to the Whitespring, or even by the train station if you don't mind the chances of your camp not being placed
---
If they let us set up a base that was the same as our current CAMP's, and then let us set up a second "camp" that was 20% of the physical size and 20% of the build capacity; that'd be great.
---
I want my camp to have a scenic view, a resource node, etc., but I would also like a place to literally camp out for a real-life day or two while I'm off doing stuff on the other side of the map.
---
Give us the smaller secondary camp-thing and double travel costs or something even to encourage people to use it maybe...IDK.
---
But I want a small secondary camp option, lol.

Do you want YOUR knives blunt and forks bent? I don't.

yeah true, a simple line of text means 1 thing to me who wrote it could be read completely differently by someone else and misconstrued

That says Pip-Boy color, not HUD and UI...  and in the screenshot the HUD is still yellow.
---
Should have left my comment up..
---
Unless none of them made it : (
---
So it's not just me? That... makes me feel a heck of a lot better!
---
Somewhat related - in Fallout 4, if you changed your pip-boy colour, that's the colour the light emitted from it would be. When I played it, I made it white, so it'd be bright and light things up like natural light. I hate the look of the green light coming out of my arm to light up dark areas, so I always wear a mining helmet, and that light takes precedence. It doesn't fit with my outfit, but I'd prefer to see white/yellow light rather than green! I don't completely mind the yellow of the HUD, but the ability to change it would be a nice feature.
---
Can't wait until I can edit my .ini files on my PS4 /s
---
Edit- typo
---
Yeah I guess
---
Someone tried making a corn maze not too long ago. Maybe give that a try and see how it goes!
---
Ok so based on your advice, I did the following things:
---
Put each Slugger perk to 1 star. Giving me 30% damage boost but allowing me to pick up Blocker 3* and Incisor 3*
---
Got rid of Evasive to put the points into Batteries Included 3*. This gives me 6 points in intelligence which allows me to swap out gunsmith, makeshift warrior or science of their highest ranks. 
---
The rest didn't seem to need to move around. I kept the gunslinger perks to maximize gamma gun ballistic damage so that it's still somewhat useful in pve.
---
To be fair, thats not a fault of having human NPC's but more in the writing and development behind them, given I can be quite good at making up little explanations for things and head canon is strong, but I get that for other they need to be told more directly and leave less to the imagination
---
Funny thing is, I'm by the Whitespring now. My issue is that I'm going to be overencumbered and I don't want to mess with the trek back every day. But I take your point.
---
Feels like it should be a simple fix for bethesda. But would maka a huge impact on The feel of the game. Would be wonderful
---
Spend a week with weight reduction perks on and mod any weapons and armour you get to be as light as possible, I reckon. Maybe if you roll some weight reduction stuff you could wear that too to help?
---
You're a hero, sir! So I can see what you mean. Also, that mask is much darker than the ritual bindings (which I had not noticed before). Thank you!!
---
That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt fuck with Facebook. It‚Äôs too polarising. Not just with Fallout, but with any topic in general.
---
Reddit is also susceptible to the hive mind mentality, but in general is more accepting of differing opinions.
---
I think it's damage threshold like the other poster said.  I would like to add though: at least once when wearing 2 pieces of life saving gear, i died completely and suddenly was back up again.  Confused the hell out of me and the friend I was with!  Another friend said check for life saving gear.  I didn't realize I had any but I had on 2. 
---
I swapped them out shortly after so I don't know if this is intended or glitch.
---
Sounds like a fun build to try though.
---
demands a feature
---
makes fun of developers
---
Not trying to be rude but they spend a lot of resources and time on dlc and events so I'm glad they are keeping this game fun üôÇ
---
Actually I swapped gunslinger to 1* and added in 3* action boy/girl and put evasive back in. 
---
Also crack shot is just something to fill perception so I can swap in lock pick cards.
---
When going to a nuke zone, lower the sound effects bar in the audio settings. You can still hear enough but it lowers the sounds of guns and the deafening roar of the nuke cloud.
---
Ahh, misread that. Not anywhere that I've seen.
---
I have a 4GB one that a friend gave me. Just seems like one of those things I have never got around too. Don't want to have to download it all again
---
Yeah, because you can‚Äôt because it‚Äôs hard coded in the SWF files. I know because I‚Äôve done it, but was too much trouble to keep updated after every release
---
I bought a salty mod for 800.  Seemed fair
---
No. It only works on Ore Nodes. Acid and Oil pits are something different. I‚Äôm not certain, but I don‚Äôt think it works on ore pits either.
---
Make a post on Reddit, saying you're looking for 2-3 teammates. Guaranteed success and you can do multiple runs together (requires changing servers)
---
Nice, 1 tip though, when doing panoramic shots, hit the Square button since your on PS4, it'll hide the camera menu leaving just the screen for good panoramic pan overs
---
Adjust your graphics in your tv settings.  Mine did that until I changed the tv settings.
---
Awesome find dude!
---
Haha! I only found out recently that my build was terrible. Which might explain why I am so garbage at it. Apparently Wardens are NOT where it's at. Who knew?? I bought the game with Morrowind, which was nice, but I wanted to start the game the normal way... and then it spiraled out of control from there. 76 is a much less baffling game. I find I keep coming back to 76 in a way that I just don't think I will with ESO.
---
It's a waste of bullets honestly. It's been happening more than it was before lately.
---
Feel free to add me, but I won‚Äôt be selling my IE Lever unless I get a better 3* IE.  I don‚Äôt even use it at the moment (bloodied), but it such a good/rare weapon I doubt I‚Äôll ever let it go.
---
That Space Marine gif is epic.
---
I spent 2 days going through every plan, weapon, armor and mod to find out what I have left to unlock. If you're serious about it, I'd suggest Google sheets or something similar. The current system of telling you how many you have left to unlock is bad. There is no easy way to see which of the remaining mods are obtained through Plans, Scrapping or Other
---
It could be snapped to roofs as well.
---
Hard to explain with words but it has something to do with the the /\ shaped roof.
---
The ini settings for this don't even work, so PC players would like this too.
---
4 GB? I hope you mean terabyte...
---
A simple consequence that has no meaningful impact on the game world at large. That is the whole point I am trying to make. There is zero impact on the world.
---
"Tom, the camp was overrun, join me at the Atoms Shop."
---
I think purveyor should charge caps as well as scrip. 100 Scrip + 1000 caps for a 3* Weapon would make a great caps sink. Caps sinks are needed to pop the inflationary balloon we are seeing now.
---
I thought I fudged up and didn't do the questline for the Tinker Workbench and was getting kinda ticked about it since I saw players lower than me having it lol
---
Thanks for confirming my theory :)
---
I think 76 isnt as baffling, because it hasn't been out as long as ESO has. When ESO first came out, it was still big, yes, but it was not as overwhelming. But give fo76 a few years, and I think it'll be alot of content. I'm just afraid of the console cycle coming next year, and this game being declared dead once the new consoles come in. I know that people have said they are gonna support it and all, but with PS5 coming out to be fully be backwards compatible, I have a feeling this won't last as long as I want it to, saddly. And I thought wardens were good! Least, when they first came out I heard that. I picked a dragon Knight and dark elf. But considering I only use staffs and all, it wasn't the best race to pick. I went back to Skyrim yesterday and that was overwhelming because i have about 30 quests and only level 19 and I was getting destroyed by vampires. I quit and went back to fo76. I really wanna catch up in these games but it's hard to
---
Had the assumption there was no reading in the wastes, that's why I signed up lol
---
Oh :(  
---
Well at least if they are dead we won't know *beforehand*. In year 1 there was not often tension to find someone because Todd basically told us that everyone was dead already.
---
Maybe there‚Äôs a scent that scorchbeasts pick up...
---
But then you have the problem of them heading to a camp and wrecking someone else‚Äôs set up. 
---
Perhaps their wanted level increases to the point where players hint the guy. 
---
If a wanted player is on your team, you‚Äôre wanted too.
---
I wish I could use mods on console, but only PC has a mode that makes it so achievements can still happen, and I really want to get the achievements on my playthru so I haven't touched any mods, saddly :/
---
5.56 has high demand but .308 is the real deal because it is so rare and people who use LMG use them up so quickly.
---
I just want the stupid loot box to STOP following me after I do Collision Course!!!! Every time I fast travel, there it is!!! Aside from the fact that it has been sooo nerfed..(only 10 scorched across 5 waves??) Yawnfest!!!  Anyone else having this problem???
---
Haha really? I tried using it last night and the damage was weak so i might have to just convert it to a rifle with beam splitter and get all the perks for it to make it great. So far, it's just a show and tell weapon until I unlock all the mods
---
\* Unfollows quest marker. \*
---
Hate bullet spines too, always modded my fallout 4 to have me kill everything in a few shots but also die in a few shots myself
---
How tf you guys getting these god damn pets
---
Agreed. 20k to swap armor from one body part to another. Maybe more. Say 20k to uplevel an item to the next "level" break as well.
---
We also need cap-sinks more like Encryptid. Let us start Arktos Pharma w/ a trigger. Find a few other events and make them deterministically triggered. Cap-gate those, and let us control that a bit.
---
* Sell Nuclear Keycards in the Enclave Bunker military wing so we don't have to shoot down the bot. Increase their cost, but make them non-tradeable.
---
* Allow us to buy other event-trigger items and craft them ... 
---
   * Arktos Pharma - make it same approx as Encryptid ... 2000c (or more)
---
   * Cheaper - say 500c ... let us buy a jukebox repair kit and start One Violent Night
---
      * This one is fun and popular, good XP and decent mass loots
---
   * Let us spend 1000c to buy a fertilizer catalyst from the vendor in Harper's Ferry and kick off the quest to both flush fertilizer and spawn the strangler pods but also kickstart Heart of the Swamp
---
      * I'd spend it just to be able to reliably farm and craft Rad Shield, as would many others
---
   * Let us buy a collection of mining tools to take to the terminal outside the mines and kick off Lode Bearing
---
      * Ores and such, plus it has the claim token mechanic.
---
   * Let us buy a beacon to take to a location and kick off Breach and Clear
---
      * Again, ores and such. People farming lead or other for ammo would benefit.
---
      * No longer drop the meteoric sword, give it a chance to drop PLANS for the meteoric sword. Make it like the Fixer ... people would flock to this then.
---
   * Consider some other beacon-like purchase to kick off AWOL, A Real Blast, It's a Trap and maybe Battle Bot.
---
Yeah, I'll look into that. And I'll probably start throwing stuff up for sale tonight to start clearing out extra room.
---
I already completed all the World Challenges that are not broken (currently about 7 of them do not work and cannot be completed), so it's slow slogging from here on out.
---
Wow hes got some real skill there, those pics look great!
---
Buy ammo, buy all the plans, buy more ammo... remeber... caps are always worth something
---
I just ignore them, like you said being wanted is probably more of a pain than being killed for 5 caps
---
20K?! Are you joking? You think everyone is a trader? Buy ammo...
---
I‚Äôm just happy I found a you can change the HUD while in power armor to normal. BEST DAY EVER! Now I use power armor! Haha!
---
In the game, pre wild Appalachia there are, let me see... 1, 2, 3, yes 3 people you hear of who are not dead.  Wild Appalachia adds at least one more.
---
Of course, in all those cases you end up killing them.  Hope it works out better for the Wastelanders.  :)
---
For me anytime I find .308 for 1 cap it is an auto buy, 2 caps I think about it. Flamer Fuel is another if I find it for 1 cap. Those two are easier to buy that craft, all other ammo I just craft.
---
1. Didn't demand anything, simply asking a question.
---
2. If your definition of "making fun" is pointing out the fact that 76 suffers from bugs with patches then the entire community is "making fun of them"
---
3. This isn't the situation of "Oh I don't care about a slider I'd rather they focus there time on worthwhile content and updates!! Yay games!!" No. This is a QUESTION that hasnt been answered and people would like a legit reason why it's not present. Its been in every fallout game and every time it's brought up there's no response. If they came out and said "Yeah we're looking into adding a color feature in the future or it doesn't fit the look they want for the game" then that'd be a different case.
---
Cheers
---
I know, I was just joking.  I agree it is exciting to wonder which one‚Äôs made it and that anticipation opens up a whole new element of the game.  Can‚Äôt wait!
---
Mysterious Savior hasn't worked for me lately, he will show up and perform the stimpak animation but I don't get revived.
---
The outrage on one shotting legendaries is already bad, imagine this now.
---
Best one is to do what your currently doing with the traps, but turn pacifist mode on then shoot them for 0 damage
---
Bethesda will be like, Yes we will add new color hubs into the Atom shop. It will only cost you a small fee of 1000 atoms per color.
---
I used to, but once I got the trophy I stopped caring. Besides 5 caps isn't worth the other teammates the 'wanted' guy has hiding around the corner waiting to murder you.
---
Remember it's all up to you, your play-style, your choice, im just giving tips :)
---
So are you returning after 8 hours?
---
No bundle? üòÇ

My wife made her very first character yesterday and started her house on the north western area. All she had was 6 wooden foundation, 4 walls and a basic stash box. She was working hard getting all of the stuff she needed to get to finish her house when some level 200+ character showed up at the same farm house she was looting and she ran away at first thinking she was going to get killed but then the other player gave her the come here emote, showed her where a pumpkin pie was. She was happy about the friendly gesture and gave her a heart emote. After raiding the house she easily became overencumbered and started her walk of shame back to her little shack. To her surprise the character was right there waiting for her. After a friend request this girl spent 30 minutes making her house complete. With all the essentials and had a real nice hunters cabin feel. She was so greatful she gave up her only level 1 legenedary pipe pistol lol and a ton of heart emojis
---
As of late I've been finding more wandering around than I have at the typical farm locations . YMMV
---
&gt; There's so much limitation when trying to tell a story with ones and zeros. 
---
You don't have a clue about how computers work, do you?
---
NPCs in a computer game is the very definition of *a story told with ones and zeroes*.
---
Huh. I‚Äôve done the event before, so I know it doesn‚Äôt need the scope to complete the event.
---
If the recon scope helps trigger the quest, I wouldn‚Äôt mind carrying one around. I‚Äôll test it later tonight. Odds are it‚Äôs random like you said though.
---
&gt;Mostly because it's really just basic game mechanics. It's not even an exploit
---
My thoughts exactly. It's part of the fuckin game, get over it. I don't go around killing people or bases, but I've had my CAMP destroyed numerous times when I was lower level. Shit happens, it's part of the game. But calling anyone and everyone a *griefer* is just plain silly-sauce. If FO76 didn't want you to have the option of destroying CAMPS it wouldn't be a mechanic. 
---
I turned this one kids lights off and he went on to send me message claiming, "You're a griefer trying to get people not to notice my camp"; I was just bored. 
---
That said, now that I'm over lvl 100, people usually don't want to mess with me nearly as much
---
No bundle yet. Its a new item. Needs to be 6 months old before it can go on sale.
---
How so?
---
Raider Possums ?
---
It's easy but takes a while.
---
Get either/or both Animal Friend and Wasteland Whisperer and rank up as desired Different creatures require different levels and Perks (I \*think\* you need lvl3 to of Wasteland Whisperer to tame a deathclaw but don't quote me on that - I had both at rank 3 equipped when I tamed fluffy). 
---
Next Equip the card first then go to a random event node and server hop until you get one with an animal in it. Then just aim down sights at it (DO NOT SHOOT IT!) and hit the Tame button (on PC it's R), if only the pacify option appears then your out of luck and need to try again. 
---
I've not done it myself but I believe you can get a max of 2 pets, one with Animal Friend and one with Wasteland Whisperer.
---
I got this fella at the spot just east of Firebase Hancock.

Beautiful thank you I'll visit him tonight for a look only have 15 scrip üòÇ

I wonder who that friend might be... or if perhaps your friend was the one running scripts and got you fucked over.  I hope this spells the end of you and your friends duping bullshit...
---
I don't care about the HUD color, but the cross hair cursor is basically invisible for me.
---
You can't snap those, you can however snap the wall pieces with an agled lower side. I mean the pieces that can be snapped to the low triangle to create the full wall.
---
I've been trying to experiment with a Vampire's Mr. Handy Buzz Blade in a similar way.  Inconclusive results though, because it doesn't deal enough damage to lock her onto me, so I'm stuck trying to chase her down and she'll turn and impale me.
---
Do you mind telling me who they are with spoiler tags?
---
The only one I have is &gt;!the Overseer!&lt;.
---
u/Ladydevann if there was ever a person who deserved to have a pristine mr. Fuzzy costume more then u/kuriakon they would implode on their own greatness.
---
Plz in the name of the mothman give u/kuriakon a pristine fuzzy suit!!!!
---
maybe they'll get to it later because they're focusing on wastelanders and they want it to have a smooth launch
---
lol i know right, did a few extra caps runs for the 6k i lost
---
Out of all the things that need fixing in the game this is waaaay back in the que, fix the flipping servers from crashing first!
---
West Virginia is the state.
---
ty for that response. very nice info. i never thought it might be another thing when being in an event. i will have to test more.
---
Geez, of all the things to complain about... I wish this thread didn‚Äôt focus on complaining or pleading so much.
---
Thanks will check out
---
hm to me it happened like this: savior arrives and helps me up, but during the animation i get killed from some area dmg or poison.
---
FULL SLANT WALLS, try using them. You can then snap half slant wall to them to add some structure or texture.
---
I just put a period at the start of all my weapons i want to keep. So when scripping, all the important stuff is at the top and stuff i scrip is at the bottom, and it's pretty easy to identify the line between the two
---
The idea of getting a "hot server" is very real.  Sometimes, you'll get one where Legendaries are all over the place.  Even multiple times in the same session.  And sometimes, you'll get others which are in a permanent drought.
---
That said, I will fully accept the belief that *something* has changed in the last month or so, because these instances are getting increasingly rare.
---
Belly of the Beast, the last of Rose's quest, and the first or second Free States quest were all sitting in my quest log unfinished for between two to four months before I bothered to finish them. I had already completed the Enclave quests and beaten several SBQs. If *anything* is a requirement, it's the Enclave quests, but even then I'm pretty sure at least one of my commendations for Officer On Deck *was* an SBQ.
---
The only I could agree with more cap sinks is with no cap limit.
---
But the scrip refresh? Hell yeah!!!!! But without scrip limit. 
---
I HATE LIMITS!!!!!
---
Why are your imgur pics posted from the imgur account for 90smemelord?  He's a well known scumbag scammer piece of shit who is clearly closely affiliated with you.  If you are even on good terms with that person it makes me distrust everything you say immediately, I suspect he is the friend that uses your account.  Probably the reason you got what you deserve.
---
it would be awesome if it worked like in the raids or in nw, maybe with a smaller timer. this way you could build around it. the system now is just confusing and not really usable imo.
---
I actually don't have that mod. I have been playing for ages, all on Steam, and yet I have so few achievements...
---
I'm probably in the minority here, but I really like the empty feeling of FO76. I enjoy the limited interactions with the bots, I like tracking down how people died, and the futility in their stories. Yeah, they all ended up dead, but that's kind of the way the news goes in an apocalypse.
---
Can confirm they do exist, i farmed them about a week ago, and immediately stocked a vendor with them
---
Try looting the corpse fully instead of just the plan
---
I'd like to trade my caps for scrip.
---
I know. Just kept forgetting didn't realize till I was on my PC. Didn't want to reshoot.
---
They just emailed me. It‚Äôs fixed. And also it‚Äôs just happened to another Xbox player, the fact that it‚Äôs happened again is not a good sign.
---
Free Flamer as well in skins section but make sure it says free as 2nd one that looks similar to it.
---
I spent 2/3 of my long weekend in Skyrim. It was a great holiday! Skyrim was the game that showed me that I had the potential to actually play and enjoy these games. Many mods later, I still find things I have never found before! You were being destroyed by vampires? Dawnguard?
---
"umdraco" PS4
---
What do you mean with fully looting? Does it increase the chance for plans the next time or are they invisible or something?
---
You'll earn those caps back in no time.  Sounds like a great toy.
---
Is this a Bioshock reference?
---
afaik the fixer plan is a rare reward for the encryptid event. As for lowe, some parts of the quest are buggered and you need to serverhop.
---
Haha! That's solid. Of course, no one would be on the other side of the door. People would have to gather together for that...
---
;)
---
I think it‚Äôs a glitch. Ive seen what I‚Äôve said work for people and have also seen people who haven‚Äôt completed still get loot.
---
I run across those somewhat regularly. Kind of pisses me off when I start a Camp Fast Travel looking of items.
---
he might be refering to &gt;!the overseers husband!&lt; as a second one
---
Yoda you are! Do you vend? Sometimes when people get salty about the prices, they have been known to murder poor innocent brahmin.
---
&gt; why are you (and others) so excited for human NPCs?
---
I'm more excited for human enemies. Can't wait to pillage some npc settlement or caravans.
---
I actually got so tired of it that I gave up. I don't need fertilizer so badly that I need razorgrain to repair a cow. Especially since that same piece of razorgrain can go toward making fertilizer anyway!
---
By making him listen to the Grafton Mayor computer's radio station 24/7.
---
Yeah, I was just saying that it wouldn't have been sold. I wonder why I got downvoted üòÇ
---
Instead of keeping a person from getting a random roll legendary item like a legendary drill, a person who kills it before someone gets a hit in has prevented that person from getting paid actual money.  How do you think that'll go for community cohesion?
---
That sucks. What system are you on? If you're PC I can try and give you a hand. I don't keep much, but you're welcome to it.
---
You can only see Scorched if you're Scorched yourself.
---
Really? I can‚Äôt even get any offers on mine
---
I swapped to the civil war outfits, and noticed they weren't dropping plans for me after a while, so i started fully looting the corpses and they started dropping plans again
---
Could be coincidence but better safe than sorry
---
Auto + beam splitter = explosive carpet bomb
---
exactly
---
Well I would just like for my audio to work without having to plug in a headset.
---
Plot twist on the plot twist: They're authorized to play the game during certain times, so ocassionally the NPC will be seen "roaming the wasteland" and players will have to "hunt them down".
---
He doesn't know what instancing means. He thinks that because instances are unique per player, that means there is no "impact" on the world at large, because apparently he's never played an MMO with instanced content in the past 20 years.
---
Problem is that they will just disband but still grief together, using Discord or chat to coordinate.
---
Haha. Your 'lonewanderer' name is all coming together for me now!
---
&gt; Also, that I'll be fighting real actual raiders
---
I'm hope that we are also getting npc settlements and traveling trading caravans that we can rob and/or kill.
---
Thanks.
---
It'll be alot better when I can mod it out of it's pistol form haha and the caps are easy, that's a mini game by itself for me
---
Dupers Duping....should have tossed a grenade into the pile
---
*So much limitation when you're whole game is based around half-ass programmed robots.
---
Sorry for the bad pun Mr. "I took coding in college"
---
&gt;  NPCs give meaning to games, you complete missions to help someone whos unable to, or out of greed for money or info. 
---
Literally what you do with the robots in Fallout 76. Your take is bad.
---
Near dawnguard, I think that's where I was headed. Also met a giant, and he didn't like me very much so I ran away. I'm barely wearing armor and my sword, well, let's just say it's not the best. I played the hell out of Oblivion and I loved the Oblivion gates in that game, idk why I never got too into Skyrim
---
I guess I can try that, it won't cause any harm so why not
---
Damn forgot that one.
---
&gt;!The Overseer's boyfriend -- now scorched!&lt; 
---
&gt;!Alfreda "Freddie" Lang, Blackwater Bandits -- now a glowing one!&lt;  
---
&gt;!Morris Stevens, Gourmand -- now the progenitor wendigo!&lt;
---
Wild Appalachia adds:
---
&gt;!Scoot Conroy, Sheepsquatch sceptic -- now a wendigo!&lt;
---
Do you find you play alone sometimes? I find I am griefed less when I am alone, which makes no sense to me! I play with my husband sometimes, as well, and I find people come and pester us more when there are two of us. Meanwhile, when I am on my own, I am totally down to talk and hang out... and I don't see anyone for hours. And when I do, they don't even wave back at me. \*sad face\*
---
Nice. I find the biggest problem is people don't kill it before hundreds of adds spawn.
---
If your pet gets killed do you have to tame another one? Or will it respawning?
---
That looks pretty simple to dive into. I will definitely mess around with that later. Thanks, I probably would never have heard of that had you not mentioned it.
---
On a note of non-feral ghouls, I feel like they'd be the logical first step for organic NPCs. Maybe escaping some faction of lynchers or something. That could tie in later to the human NPCs showing up -- the first wave being those aggressors. That could lead into a questline where it turns out that they're not just bloodthirsty but there's a legitimate reason why they're hunting the ghouls.
---
From there it becomes a decision to help the ghouls or the humans. BOOM, two parties of new NPCs and a fledgling faction system that could also integrate into PVP opportunities.
---
After that, the human faction could send word back to wherever they came from and that invites new groups to come in via radio intercept, word-of-mouth, etc. It opens the door.
---
I often have some new players top by my camp. I normally seat them down, make them starlight berry cobbler, some lemonade, give them some purified water, and give them some stimpacks and radaway. On rare occasions when I have a lot of spare junk I offer to set them up with the cabin design I run, a pretty nice house design. They often in turn help others to pay it forward.
---
LOL, didn't have to see it!   If you see it in person it looks like a pyroclastic flow of duped items. Seen it on top of the train station as well, spewing out of the chimney.  Best is to toss a grenade while the dupers are picking them up
---
I don't usually have my mic on, but I wave at everyone I see. And then try not to take it personally if they don't wave back.
---
My first experience:)
---
My gamerscore on Xbox is my prize and joy. I'm only at 42k achievement points but that's a ton to me. I like hearing that sound when one pops up. I just wish on Xbox I could play some of the cool mods. I ruined the ending of fo4 for myself because of people spoiling it so maybe that's why I never wanted to play as much. That along with the fact I don't like how the power armor system works in it compared to fallout 3. And because I loved fallout 3 and it isn't really the same
---
I'd be down for that, though. I doubt it'd be hard to slap an analytic bot in there and track the outcomes of specific questlines. After X period of time happens, if more players chose option B instead of A, then B becomes FO76 Canon and is implemented as a change to the game world.
---
I'm lower level and it seems like I'm mostly fighting scorched
---
Become Rambo.
---
It would be nice to have a basement system in game. Would likely turn mine into my workshop or into a little speak-easy. It would also be nice to get vertical half-walls.
---
I did indeed take programming in "college", 42 years ago.  Been working in the industry non stop since them.
---
NPCs are the very definition of "half-ass programmed robots".  Do they pass *your* version of the Turing test?  If they do I'm sorry for you.
---
Who was that robot on the top of the world? Was that Rose? She's a legitimate NPC. Dialogue, quest giving, a proper name, all that. She's just not humanoid.
---
Someone did this at my camp las time I played. Thousands and thousands of meat cleavers and nuke mines
---
The bag is inside the patrol car. Are you sure this step is not already registered? Go behind the house with the pink flamingos and check if there is the next items on the corpses. Usually it doesn't bug at this step.
---
I used to have a free ammo machine. I have a habit from previous Fallout titles of picking up all the ammo I find. It was a handy place to drop it. Most people took what they needed and left everything else (what were they going to do with it, put it in their own vending machine? Most ammo is worth zilch.) Ocassionally some asshat would roll up and clean me out. It was usually a level 200+. 
---
But I usually had the last laugh: sure, take it all. Have the flares and the crossbow bolts! You'll just drop them somewhere!
---
So you wish high level gear was harder to get yet it should be easier to get?
---
Question. Where do I go to get some myself?
---
It definitely is.
---
I've had people come in to my discord and rename the link to "my trading list" to try to get normal people too, but thank god the guy that tried to do it was dumb enough to shout at everybody in the group the day before he posted a really sketchy link...
---
Didn't you say 76 is what ESO should've been? Pot meet kettle...
---
Is there a video for this?
---
Unfortunately, unless something has changed recently, you will need to tame another one.
---
That doesn't mean everybody effected is a duper though.  It's easy as hell to rename a link from "dupescript.exe" to "tradinglist.exe" and have normal people click it thinking you're just trying to trade.
---
Couldn't people still dupe the new weapons? I've noticed a lot of people are getting "lucky" and getting bloodied ffr, and junkies ffr fixers already. I have a hard time believing that so many of them would exist already, so I think people still do it. Also as of right now getting a full set of gear would be almost impossible for a casual player. If something goes for caps, its max caps, obscene amounts of 5.56, or trade only for other impossible to get items.
---
I didn't know duping was possible on PS4. There was no one around at all trying to pick them up or anything. Hopefully I don't banned now for selling them LOL.
---
Thanks Bud, I appreciate it but it was on PS4. I eventually got the entire camp rebuilt, but it did take quite some time.
---
1 and 5 are absolutely active bugs. I experience those every time I play. Also Xbox.
---
Sounds like the old Wires bug with a different object. Hmm, if it is that bug (not saying it is, could be new) then moving camp won't fix the issue. Take a video, show the issue, explain what should be happening vs. what is actually happening, and then send it in a bug report
---
Do you do *all* of the Whitespring or just the golf club?
---
To be honest, the wasteland might stay quite empty even with human characters here and there.
---
Wtf?  No it's not?  You still duped items and didn't get them legitimately.
---
"Killing a few people and killing a ton is real.  I'm not Hitler, I'm just a serial killer"
---
Thanks for this response... very helpful. I've never seen anyone selling one stars at 100 though, perhaps I'm a bit unlucky ha ha
---
.....? 1 agility?   Oh I know what's going on, you cant see us agility guys. We are to sneaky.  Even the queen cant see me when I'm up in her face.
---
More CAPs
---
Aww. This is a GREAT story! I have done this sometimes. The last time it was a lowbie who rolled up to my vendors (I'm in the forest for people just like him). He picked up some ammo (I had it for free at the time) and called a friend over to look through it, too. Then he sent me a request to team up. The two of them together probably added up to level 15 and I didn't have anything I could lose in my pockets, so I accepted and found his camp nearby... and built. A real bed, a mid-sized generator, weapon/armor workbenches. Hearing the excitement was just as awesome as being on the receiving end when I started out.
---
Build a queen killing platform, maybe with anti-add turrets, or just stairs.
---
More than likely you won't be
---
Okay you're focused on the wrong damn thing. The robot NPCs in fallout 76 are some of the worst NPCs in any game ever. I believe this is dude to the fact that they're robots not human. That's my new and only point.
---
Idk about 90smemelord but I know people that are almost brand new to the game that have been affected just because they clicked a link labeled "tradelist.exe".  So don't just assume EVERYBODY effected is a duper, somebody can easily use it to screw over the average person as well.
---
I run solo or 3-6 people in a loose group keeps stupid people from being to stupid lol you on console or?
---
Thank you for that, I will keep that in mind !
---
Happens on the 1s to me once a month or so, also occurs with rainbow six siege
---
You are correct. I unlocked the arms yesterday after scrapping what bust have been my 100th arm.
---
Welcome back, get yourself some legendary armors that can reduce carried item weights. The reduction is huge.
---
If you want adhesive just head to the Cranberry bog with green thumb and collect digested goo from the carnivorous looking plants there. IIRC each is worth about 4 adhesive when scrapped.
---
There's a random event that can happen at Crevasse Dam, somewhere near the 65 sign on the map
---
Yes that is rose. BIV is also a good NPC. Also pioneer scouts are good
---
I have been told the Halloween plans won't spawn again if you have the Halloween holotape in your inventory. The halotapes start with the letter A, I think.
---
It should apply for the legs too I believe mate, once u get the lead limb unlocked its all limbs. But congrats. Its like that last and hardest one to unlock
---
When this happens, hop servers if you're doing anything affected by lag. This makes a server go choppier than a slap chop. Makes Encryptid and queens almost unbearable
---
When you're over 20k caps and your stash is full... sell something nice for cheap or even give it away. You will be glad you did. It's a game, it should be fun. Karma dudes.
---
Fellow power smith here. Just tipping my helmet to you. Chassis for our lassies, am I right? üí™üèºü§ñüëäüèº
---
Never have this issue you on console or pc?
---
Turn on pacifist mode in settings.
---
Saw that my first week in the game, awesome to see normally hostile creatures just being dumb animals ha
---
Lol. Took me a second!
---
This is actually a brilliant idea. Caps don't buy you scrips, you still need to farm for legendaries but they can reset the annoying daily limit. This way people will grind much harder. Now I run out of stuff to do when I get a few pieces here and here to make the 150. üëçüëçüëç
---
Mention that you will pay atoms and they will happily do it lmfao
---
No, I meant drops for different sets from bosses. Such as other mmos.
---
Which sounds much less cool when you learn the "v" is pronounced as a "w".
---
Sounds like something from *The Life Of Brian".
---
May be risky but have you tried deleting the stored objects?
---
Same here
---
The best legendaries I have were gifts. I hope I was appropriately grateful. When I asked what I could do, he said he was doing the "end game"- inventory management. He's a sniper, so what was he going to do with an explosive shotgun? And, in his own words, "They're just a bunch of pixels". Sometimes something is wholesome not for the deal you got, but for the fact that you had an interaction with someone online, and it wasn't toxic and awful.
---
u/alienfister
---
Maybe, idk, I thought they've fixed the armor and weapon duping.
---
Ok firstly this isnt ESO at all second turn on pacifist mode and pvp is basically off
---
The reload bug, coupled with the fact that I have to hit reload multiple times before my character actually starts reloading, is infuriating.  I primarily use heavy weapons so the reload times are long already and the delay makes it 10x more frustrating!
---
Here is a typical run through of what happens:
---
* Enemy is charging me so I switch to an appropriate weapon.
---
* Weapon isn't loaded due to bug you listed.
---
* Hammer reload key until reload animation finally starts.
---
* Enemy hits me and interrupts the reload.
---
* Finally get the gun loaded, start holding down the trigger to spin-up the weapon.
---
* Enemy hits me again and interrupts the firing process.
---
* Frustrated, I decide to switch to a weapon that has no spin-up mechanic.
---
* THAT FUCKING WEAPON ISN'T LOADED EITHER.
---
Vampire (on a fast-hitting weapon). It takes a LOT of enemies/hits to significantly reduce my health bar.
---
I did this a couple of days ago and it worked for me on Xbox. Also you get the Fixer itself but not the plan that a reward for the event.
---
This guy is going to have to be like the SBQ: he's just going to have to keep coming back. New end game: put the bastard down for good.
---
Everybody assumes that just because the biggest group hit WAS hackers and dupers, that nobody that's innocent has been affected.  But really, how easy is it to change a link name from "dupescript.exe" to "tradelist.exe" and have your every day average trader click it just to be key logged without them knowing?
---
Sure, celebrate the downfall of hackers and dupers all you want but this still is a huge security risk to potentially a lot more people than just hackers and dupers.
---
That's a shame, I'd have paid a lot for that if it had -90% weight as well.
---
in my head it is
---
Sentinel isn't on the armor tab
---
Yes same problem here but adding that if i kill a scorch beast it will also do the same thing as the loot box.
---
That's interesting... does sentinel work against pylon damage?
---
Fair enough
---
The one on the corpses are called 'Appalachia Landmarks: Pumpkin House' if I remember. I don't have any of those on me
---
There really isn't a steady market value/price because many of the items are too thinly traded. Even if you got a good sale price today, there's no guarantee that you could re-buy the same item for that price later, and you cannot store enough caps to re-buy everything you sell.
---
Oh? Thanks I‚Äôll check. I was trying to help some low levels last week by making lead lined combat armor but could only do the chest lol.
---
You don't think rose would be more interesting as a human raider NPC with a dialogue tree that you could befriend or become enemies with, that could attack you or follow you around?
---
How funny different people are. I don't actually care about the junk at all. I always have way more junk than I need/use. The only reason I have the Collectron at my CAMP is his witty banter. Tamed creatures die too fast, so having him clunking around making puns about junk is the only life my camp has. I've named him Manfred.
---
&gt; Okay you're focused on the wrong damn thing
---
I have no way of seeing the thoughts in your head, I can only reply to the words you write.
---
I can't decide if I upvoted this for the last name twist or the plot twist, but it was a magnificent comment, regardless!
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt have a direct answer, but somewhere is a great list of junk prices for buyers and sellers, maybe someone has the link saved.
---
I gave the queen some berry mentats.
---
price isn't that good because of the dupe glitch. Seen it sell 4:1 caps. So try selling it 1:1 if that doesn't work try selling it for 2:1
---
id say go check how much a vendorbot sells bulk steel for and undercut it so players will have incentive to buy from you instead
---
im sorry but im not sure how much a bulk steel goes for off the top of my head
---
Haha, and it's annoying when u can't do something on this game, I took a few weeks out to learn lead lined for all armors, cos my main was a bloodied, took a longg time. But yeah, pretty sure ull be able to do all limbs now man, and as u know the chest are all plans, apart from robot if I remember, pure doesn't drop/exist (lead chest robot)
---
30c a piece. But with the current meat cleaver issue, its 2 to 1 on the market.
---
I typically just sell mine at 25c a piece
---
I'm part of a faction called the remnant 
---
https://discord.gg/kcF7req
---
But if you don't want to join but still have someone to group with my psn is ibiza4me
---
Theres absolutely nothin wrong with people pleading to make the game better. I mean we are basically the ones that are making this game more bareable and semi fun to play because of our "pleading".
---
Don't get me wrong, the whitty banter is great but there aren't enough lines to cycle through before it becomes annoyingly redundant for me.  That is why I'm not asking for its removal, simply an option to turn it on and off at will.
---
Not completely, I'd still be wary of random and sketchy looking links.  People have come into my discord and posted shit like "tradelist.exe" just to have people question him "why is it an .exe file?  Why do we have to download your trade list?"  Turns out the dude was one of the dupers that has been spreading that link.
---
the mire aka legendary highway.
---
Sure
---
i dont have the robots myself, but i do get annoyed when visiting other players camps and hearing the same things over and over, i cant imagine having to hear that all the time at my own base
---
and is finding junk that big of a problem for people?  its literally everywhere in this game
---
I had the same problem - display stuff, or crops?  Instead, I built near a farm that has crops.  Now I don't have to worry about that aspect and I can display more stuff.
---
HAPPY CAKE DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
the 1 liners are the reason to get it.. not the pitiful amount of ju k it finds.. lol
---
Somebody is always going to find a way to dupe. The only methods patched are known methods that have been disclosed. The only thing I have ever seen successfully deployed in a game is making items no trade and unique per character. Of course people still find ways around this as is evident by the strangler armor being up for sale on eBay. 
---
Yes I think stuff is still being duped today even after the hotfix last week, but I have also received some pretty bitchin drops in the last couple months that have become my primary weapons on a couple new characters.
---
They may not be able to kill you directly, however if you are near something that explodes like cars, they can have a chance to take you out without direct fire.
---
If you want.
---
5.56 sells for me everyday, everyday i travel and get enough lead and steel to make 1000 5.56 and sell for 1 cap each, and it sells within minutes
---
I'm like 550 hours in am just now starting to get a bit bored. Also wastelanders is coming up, so I'm sure I'll get some more playtime out of that and future updates. It's been a rather good return on investment
---
I sell it for a little more than it says it's worth.
---
I can see if you're there a lot it'd get old. I'd love more lines, for sure. 
---
Mind if I ask why you're hanging at camp so much?
---
Yeah, keep it off your phone, eventually you'll find yourself logging in less and less. I still keep mine for family , but I check it mayyyyybe once in 3 weeks
---
Before they change the HUD color, maybe they could fix it so quest markers actually appear, and I mean not just occasionally but all the time, like in a normal game.
---
Yeah, I paid $60, got my fucking money's worth by now
---
Yeesh. So, lose more of my camp budget in the hopes that they fix it sometime in the near future? I'm extraordinarily hesitant to do that, considering how long it's taken them to fix some other bugs. It sounds like a losing proposition on my part, and I don't have an alternate character to switch to for the demonstration and bug report.
---
BSS+1 is the preferred melee roll. B40%+1, alternatively. you can't use unarmed weapons (such as mole miner gauntlets) inside PA.
---
in terms of dps, it's DCG &gt; supersledge &gt; combat knife
---
you can't use the DCG and the combat knife is for sneaking purposes. so the supersledge. there are also variations for each, such as a grognak's axe being only slightly weaker than the supersledge.
---
It says "returning" but there's advice for prospective players, too.
---
I can see how maybe there should be some way to say "this wanted guy is in a group", but it sounds completely fair to me that the person hunting the wanted person should be able to be shot back at.
---
Plus, if there's more than just the wanted guy, then you should always take that possibility in to consideration.
---
The ones that were on display, or the actual displays?

I agree with everything you said except the bit about Bethesda dialogue. You have to dig and go back in time a bit, but I remember being VERY impressed with the dialogue in FO3... and disgusted with it in FO4. In three, there were options based on skill levels, perks, etc to chose from, and they were EXACTLY what you were saying to the NPC. As opposed to 4 having four options that didn't tell you what you were going to say. Sometimes I would play a whole sequence through again because he did not say what I thought he was going to say.
---
What I WOULD love to see come back was the system in NV where you could do things you might not have been able to because this time, you're wearing the uniform of whatever faction you're trying to get around. That would be easy enough. They did it in Skyrim in the Thalmor Embassy, so it can't be THAT hard!
---
That's a great idea! Bind on pick up! I wish they would do that on some items.
---
You don't have to be a trader.
---
I don't trade to receive caps, I trade caps to receive gear or trade gear for gear. I don't have vendors at any of my camps. In short, I have 0 cap inflow from trades. However I still have problems spending enough caps to keep 5 toons and 1 mule at a safe buffer away from the 30k limit each. Believe me it is not from lack of trying. 
---
I'd welcome useful cap sinks in this game.
---
Bots buy it for 8, so I sell it for 7.
---
Nope, not inside the patrolcar. It is closed, but there are 2 duffelbags next to it. One of them lies in a shalow grave ..
---
Hi fellow 40k'er love the idea, you should burn the mutants too and scorch look very reminicent of possessed worshipers of the ruinous powers.
---
I have a t-51b helmet, x-01 torso and t-60 arms n legs, my character looks alot like a space marine lol
---
PvP players don't use AA/E Tesla's unless they're meme'ing.  The explosive effect does the same thing to a tesla that it does to a flamer and cryolator, and the reason people pick tesla's is because all you have to do to hit people is shoot at the ground and it bounces the laser to them.  Using an Explosive tesla means you actually have to aim, which is honestly just counter productive.
---
The actual display
---
Yep, I just got him to make my camp less lonely, but he does talk way too often.
---
Ive had issues with this myself on ps4
---
Yep, and you haven't made comment once about the game. Just letting me know why I'm wrong.
---
I make my own 5.56, 5mm and 50. 
---
I buy 45 and 308 whenever I see it at 1 cap.
---
Or you could try taking the stored weapons out of your stash and replacing the weapon displays.
---
Bloodied swing speed super sledge is probably the best backup weapon for a bloodied power armor build. 
---
The Grognaks axe is more about sneaking. 
---
The Mole miner's gauntlet is "unarmed", so you cannot use it in power armor. 
---
Nearly any one or two handed weapon will be fine as a backup weapon.
---
Wastlanders is when they add npcs, right?
---
And raiders. I am so excited to shoot me some (NPC) raiders. You, I'm sure, are lovely.
---
Yeah
---
It doesn't.
---
Not just in your head, but in mine too
---
Thanks guys!
---
Can we also get a 308 combat rifle reciever mod
---
I was going to say the same thing. FO76 would be a much better game if it had more of the basic mechanics ESO has. ESO is a much better multiplayer port.
---
As far as passivist, there are plenty of ways to get around that. It's not a catch all end all.
---
If I had to take a guess, I would say we're talking about walking into a settlement you're allied with after Wastelanders. Presumably, if you sign on with the settlers, they won't try to kill you every time you walk into town (I hope).
---
Read the other 70000 threads asking the same question.
---
Ssshhhhhhh dont give them any ideas.
---
It's the only reason I have it. Who needs the utility? It's a wonderful CAMP accessory.
---
It‚Äôs been fun so far even without npc, the story explains why every one is gone, so it‚Äôs still a nice progression  
---
Look for the Transentenial version it goes on sale often for 25$
---
Nope.
---
If you're wanted, and you want to start a fight, just go around wacking people until their electric discharge mutation procs.  It damages the bounty player and starts a fight.  This only works if the person with the mutation is OUT of pacifist though.
---
So instead of feeling like your choices make no impact because the world never changes, you get to feel like your choices made no impact because the world changes ignore you if you chose "wrong"?
---
Drop the 20$ this game returns more than that in replayability and future content.
---
I wish I knew the stats off the top of my head, but last night, someone had a 3\* submachine gun and 3\* combat shotgun for something like 1000, and 2500.  Those fit my build perfectly, and it's the first time in a LONG time I've seen someone with a reasonable price on items.   All the drops I get normally haven't been good for my character and I spent all of last night having a blast with them.
---
In a sense they have already done this with items. Backpacks, vault steel, vault armor (though apparently not 100% effective).
---
I'd be wary of introducing this on all legendary weapons and armor. I actively run 5 toons, my wife has her own. Rarely do we loot gear that is suited for the toon we are playing at the time. 
---
On the other hand, I 100% support it for boss specific drops, which we don't really have at the moment as you have already pointed out. I would have been supportive of it being applied to the survival weapons even though it would prevent me from having two Unstoppable Monsters on my unarmed toon like I currently do.
---
Not OP, but both myself and my bff both have the collectron. We tend to spend a lot of time at camp. All of our workbenches are there to craft, scrap, and repair. She needs to repair a lot, I don't think her shotgun lasts an hour without breaking.
---
It's also a free fast travel point, which makes traveling cheaper. We don't even need the caps anymore, we're just cheap. Haha. One if us always has Happy Camper up, so it's also the best option to AFK. May as well get Well Turned/Well rested while we're home. 
---
So, a solid 3rd of our gameplay ends up being in camp listening to the Collectron talk about their love of Mold.
---
My brother-in-law played the hell out of Morrowind. Then he took Oblivion to school. Then he got to Skyrim, played until his file was somehow corrupted, and never ever went back. I have both Morrowind and Oblivion... and didn't beat either because they weren't enough like Skyrim. I had never played an RPG before Skyrim, so all the stats and skills in the older game were more than I was prepared for at the time. Now I am just a snob about the graphics. ;)
---
Steer clear of the giants, friend. WAY clear.
---
You made the right choice since it probably would've just dropped a 1 star anyways.

---
A very different build compared to the other poster, but I thought I'd share.  This build makes you a bit squishy but with proper armor and play style you'll never be detected anyway so it won't matter.  It admittedly doesn't fit the bill for bloodied gear but it absolutely crushes regardless so I thought it might at least be interesting to look at.
---
  
---
For armor I use marine with vanguard and chameleon effects.  Anything that boosts perception, agility, or luck is a plus.
---
For weapons, instigating, junkies, and anti-armor can really pay off.  A silenced instigating lever action rifle can headshot kill about 95% of the mobs I encounter in any situation.  I dominate in wave defense and cleaning up trash spawns during scorched beast fights.  For the latter a prime receiver pays off as well.  
---
I have a secondary handmade with furious too, but junkies is just as good here.  This gun is far more effective for high health / high armor targets:  bears, deathclaws, mirelurk queens, scorchedbeasts, etc.  I just aim for the head in vats and unload.  
---
I usually setup guns to have bonus crit damage, but if you've got a gun specifically for scorched fights then prime is the way to go.
---
With vanguard armor, if you are caught, you can take a few hits while sprinting away to re stealth.  Though this rarely should be an issue.  Ultra light mods can save you weight and boost AP so def shoot for those.
---
Carry weight is low, at about 235 with backpack and the marsupial mutation.  To offset this a little, chem and food weight perks are really nice.  I always have tons of meat, water, and booze on hand.  You can really take advantage of the well fed perk and get damage resistance and AP bonuses, both essential to this build.  If you don't use energy weapons, grounded is another mutation to pick up.
---
This build actually works out fairly well for PVP too.  I stalk targets with the handmade and unload the clip before they even spot me.  This has yet to not kill my target.  However, if you're spotted, you're toast.  No sneak/crit bonuses and you're basically made of glass compared to anyone in PA.  
---
The build isn't perfect, it's not well rounded and there's not much you can do aside from run away if you're discovered.  The low carry weight is a bummer too.  I have several builds I really like, but this one is by far the most fun and rewarding.  It's exciting in that it's not forgiving, and will punish you if you make a mistake.  Keeps it interesting for me and genuinely fun.
---
As an aside, it's hilarious fun to nest off a cliff facing someone's camp, and just troll them with a sniper rifle from afar.  I don't try to kill them, just shoot them every once in a while and watch the confusion through the scope.
---
You might be confusing Distant Thunder with Powering Up Thunder Mountain.
---
Democracy is non-negotiable
---
On a serious answer though, it would definitely be frustrating but it'd be a price to pay for the ability to have a dynamic multiplayer world.
---
Ah, I see. I'm always in pacifsist so I wouldn't know. Lol
---
I had a feeling this one was coming.
---
I mean, I understand the usage of a camp. OP specified that he's spending more time than usual at his "these days", so I was curious why.
---
Not true...I have a level 115 not even enclave...just doing Rose's stuff right now and get loot from SBQ event all the time...just not doing enough damage is the issue....I used to not get loot from her a lot until I change to a heavy gunner with this character
---
I liked the change to the power armor (which they have, thank gods, kept for 76). I miss the dialogue options in 3, though, so I did my million dollar happy dance (!!) when the devs said that's more what they're going for with Wastelanders. Maybe it won't totally suck this time! :D
---
Yeah I saw it. I think it‚Äôs on sale for $30 on the psn store.
---
Yeah they had no drop items in EQ, even some soloable stuff was no drop. They have the ability to do it like with prime meats and the camera etc. We need some proper raids
---
I bet! Glad you're back up on your feet!
---
Cool, thanks. I‚Äôll make sure it give it a read.
---
Rose was annoying but graftons mayor was more annoying.
---
most of the ways pacifist mode was being exploited have been fixed i have not been forced into pvp in a long time.
---
I‚Äôm very surprised that there seem to be far more nice people than buttheads. It really makes the game so much more fun.
---
Happened to me last Friday. I was in a SBQ event and we already caused her health to regen with 20 minutes left :/ I was very annoyed. Does anyone know what can cause this to happen?
---
I had a level 80 who had to finish the quest to get loot. This isn‚Äôt a black and white issue. Some people had to finish to get loot while others don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know why this happens, but it‚Äôs a fix if you aren‚Äôt getting SBQ drops while putting out more than enough damage.
---
Steel has been going 1:1 for me. I sell it in my vendor. If I hit 3k before it sells I can usually sell it pretty quickly on here.
---
thank you
---
I have a bloodied build with all unyielding armor most armor had +1 strength. I have a super sledge 40% faster swing speed and it does about 950 damage. I'm trying to find a bloody combat knife with 40% faster swing speed and +1 strength.
---
My current regular bloodied combat knife does about 500 damage.
---
I would look for 40% swing speed increase, forget limb damage it's useless. And then go for a +1.
---
Some melee weapons can agro other enemies around you.
---
Bind on pickup sounds awful. My non-bloodied character is always the one getting the bloodied drops and vice versa. Half the fun of building a second character was to use the legendaries that weren't appropriate for my first character. 
---
Other games have item integrity. It shouldn't be too much to ask for in a loot-based game, but that ship has sailed.
---
Nothing on that page supports your claim.
---
I'm colorblind. This would be appreciated. But also if the NV scope can PLEASE NOT BE RED ON GREEN THX
---
I play on PC. I LIKE playing with other people, but husband doesn't play as much as he used to (read: hardly at all), and the other guy I play with sometimes... well, there's a four hour time difference, which makes it hard. I friend/team with anyone who asks, but who can send new friend requests these days, anyway?
---
Finding junk isn't a problem, but the random spare junk is nice. Helps finish dailies where you need to scrap for things, or scrap certain things. Last week one of the dailies was scraping 5 skulls, and my collectron just happened to have 2 stored away. The "Scrap for x amount of junk in 5 categories" weekly is up this week, and my bot will end up gathering 4 out of 5 requirements for me. The 5th will be fertilizer from the Brahmin.
---
I love PvP and it can be an enormous amount of fun when people aren't so upset about dying.  I actively look for bounty's and workshops on my servers since Bethesda removed Survival, but the overwhelming majority of people just whine and cry that I shot them, or say something like "wow if you wanted the workshop you coulda just asked."
---
1. Workshops have a big warning sign when you take it that SAYS they're for PvP.
---
2. Some people take this game WAAAAY to seriously to enjoy something like pvp, they just get too upset at dying and turn toxic.
---
Actually thats wrong, i got na white HUD on my custom ini. Its specific parameters you need to change. These are the ones i use:  
---
\[Pipboy\]
---
fPipboyEffectColorB=0.5000
---
fPipboyEffectColorG=0.5000
---
fPipboyEffectColorR=0.5000
---
bQuickboyMode=0
---
Why do I need proof to help?
---
Battles become serious. Doing Corvega under survival immersive circumstances was HAAAARD.
---
&gt; Maybe server hop till you see more players In that server.
---
Hey man I did this and I lucked out.  One of the servers I hopped into had some level 500+ dude with his camp set up right at the event location and there were several other 200+ people in his camp.  I started the event and not only did they come over to do it, but basically everyone on the server joined in, there were like 15+ people there.
---
No, but the other issue was that while I was running to the pylons I didn't have the benefit of sentinel so every add shooting at me was doing additional damage (and I wasn't triggering Vampire's so no health regen either).
---
Ahh, I missed that part. Carry on.
---
Ahhhhh, so that‚Äôs why they do that. I‚Äôve always accepted the invite, wave when they show up and go about my business and if ‚Äúnothing happens‚Äù in a few minutes I leave team
---
I've got a FE handmade setup with that. It's decent.  I'll toss on commando to buff it and my AAE Submachine gun sometimes for fun.
---
For that scenario to apply, it means you had to have been walking around in an enemy-infested region, with an empty weapon. You could have reloaded it at any time after you fast traveled, but you didn't and walked into a combat with an empty weapon anyway.  The bug is a bit annoying, but that scenario you posted is entirely user error.
---
Let me give you an example:
---
There WILL be a raider settlement.  Don't like raiders?  Shoot the leader in the head!  But what does this mean for you friends that DO like raiders and still want to do the quests they provide?
---
Your world will be 'instanced' to have the raider dude dead, and your quests failed for him.  But your friends will be 'instanced' in a way that the raider dude is still their for them, they can talk to him, and still take his quests.
---
These are the correct answers.
---
Middle mountain cabins. 1/3 chance of scorpions.
---
Curious how many plasma cartridges you went through?
---
The world's most considerate and polite raider? I think yes!
---
Hahaha I appreciate the suggestion.
---
I understand that people have it for that reason. Which is why I am not asking for the dialogue to be removed, I just want the option to turn it on/off when it becomes too much.  
---
Everyone has a preference and I will always respect that. I'm just asking Bethesda to allow us the choice.
---
Making baseless claims is not helping anyone.
---
Reloaded twice I think, so close to 1k?
---
I'll give both a try.
---
Hmm interesting stuff. Very cool
---
Idk what you expect, no game that's such a HUGE mmo lets you change the world to such a degree, unless it's single player games like dying light that focus almost solely on that aspect.
---
I sell mine at 15cap thru my vendor.  Usually can sell about 10 - 15 a day.
---
Someone must pay to contest the workshop.
---
There are some weird fuckeries with workshops atm. If the workshop is unowned and we are both within the boundaries, I can contest the workshop, hit you with slap damage, and start a duel.
---
If a second party contests a workshop, the first party, the owners, can kill any third party that shows up within the boundaries. Some teams have been using this to kill other players in owned workshops. They have a friend leave their team and contest, the owner then kills any third party players in the workshop. I have accidentally gotten people killed PVPing the owners.
---
Workshop PVP in adventure mode only rewards caps. You do not drop meds on death.
---
We've all done it. On the bright side, once you realized, it was like a whole new world out there!
---
Just to add to question #2, they can contest your workshop from anywhere within the workshops parameters. In other words, they do not need to get to that red table to contest the shop.
---
I fancy a nice black HUD :)
---
I'm probably 800 hours in.  What's a game worth to you that will take you that long to play out?
---
(and it's not done, there's more content coming, so it will be well over 800 before I'm finished).
---
It was the sarcasm and the obvious want for the hypothetical person to be VERY far away. It made me smile. Sorry it didn't make a whole lot of sense. lol
---
Raising the bar! looks like I have a new camp to build this weekend.
---
Think about the biggest complaint people have about this game.
---
"450 hours in, multiple max level characters, and I'm just feeling like I have nothing to do."
---
Like, duh.
---
How am I supposed to know the reload bug is triggered by fast traveling?  This is the first I've heard of it.  I swap between 5-10 weapons at any given time so figuring out which one had its reload bugged seemed random.  Is the ammo that was in the magazine deleted or is the weapon just unloaded on fast traveling?
---
As others have mentioned, make sure that you have pacifist mode on and that will solve 90% of the problem but I do agree with the sentiment. I'm personally not a fan of pvp I this game. In nw where they have balanced the weapons it is... Passable. In adventure mode in my experience it typically little more than griefing, but even if the pvp was better and you didn't just get one shot then it should still be clear to new players when they were entering a pvp state.
---
In most mmo games you have to opt in to pvp, either by going to a specific area or actively turning it on. In this game there are several ways you can actually 'accidentally' get yourself flagged for pvp which feels like bad game design. 
---
For your reference (so you can avoid it if desired) these are:
---
If your in a team and someone on your team initiates pvp with someone you also get flagged.
---
'Stealing' from a container ie. The locked air drop containers or picking a lock on someone's camp. 
---
Claiming a workshop flags pvp if someone else tries to take it. 
---
Returning fire on an aggressor.
---
There may be others but they are the main ones and the easiest to trigger is the last one but this can be mitigated entirely by turning on pacifist mode.
---
Hope that helps.
---
Some people say "I NEED that workshop for this thing" but that's horseshit, you can find any resource that's in a workshop at a different location.  There is no resource that is "workshop only" content.
---
I guess people just want the workshops so they don't have to grind so much, but then they cry about it when people come in to challenge them...
---
Yeah legs are unlocked too. Sweet Jesus I can stop picking up combat armor now. ü§ô
---
Please, for sanity's sake. Let's not start the Bethesda please stuff again
---
im guilty of playing the game too much so i know where to get the junk i need quickly
---
Great idea but knowing Bethesda they'll probably do it for Atoms and everyone will hail the idea saying it's merely a "convenience" to start events whenever we want.
---
There are already pets in the game. There is a dog and a deathclaw but you can only have one at a time. You can find them at random spawns and tame them with Wastland whisperer, and animal friend.
---
You can have three charisma and pick up a perk that says you can tame an animal and send him back to your camp. Takes a lot of budget, like a tenth of it. There's a lot of stuff to know about it so maybe Google a how to vid. Not everything is tameable, and it has to be a random world spawn of a single creature
---
You think of these things in the radiation shower? I sing at the top of my lungs! URAAAAAANIUM FEVER!!!
---
Also, yes. We've all been duped. I realized when I pulled one apart. I needed a small gear to repair something, so I opened it up. Found TWO small gears! One on each side to roll the tape through...
---
Does scrapping heavy vs. light change chances of learning while scrapping? Might just make some leather chests to finish unlocking...
---
They don't use budget anymore.
---
Just unloaded in my experience. Have checked #s a couple times.
---
Thank you!
---
I do, if they are low level and the caps are low. 
---
Usually, it's just a mistake and they are not sure how to remove it.
---
Although, I wish pacifist mode was automatically disabled when attacking wanted people because i unload several shot gun rounds into them only to see their health bar not move and me looking like a troll.
---
Thanks!
---
There's more than just a dog and a Deathclaw. Plus dataminers found out it's just one of the perks but I dunno which. But yeah you're right about random spawns
---
Some players just get a kick out of doing really bad things to players, just cause they can; and they do enjoy it.
---
Was there someone hiding in the corner? Some people have been using Nuke Mines to initiate PvP.
---
I honestly can't believe people are still playing this game
---
You think in the radiation shower? I sing. Loud. URAAAAANIUM FEVER!
---
Also, yes, we've all been had. I needed a small gear for some repairs, so I pulled one apart. I found TWO gears! They pull the tape through, you see...
---
Haha we were both correcting each other's comments that's funny
---
I stopped. I'm just back for the DLC.
---
Highest damage in the game comes from Bloodied build with Meat Hook.  The reason is that Meat Hook uses both one-handed and unarmed perk cards, and even more than that :P.  Anyway you can get up to 12k damage (and possibly higher) per hit, with all food, serum and chem buffs too.

If Bethesda were to add this, it would give 5-15 atoms at most
---
When I got them it didn‚Äôt even occur to me that they might *not* clip into the ground a bit. 
---
Currently they look god awful unless you can find a completely flat piece of land (which is crazy rare).
---
Aha, thank you for the followup on that one. I was wondering how it was initiated so fast and figured they were invisible or something heading to claim at the usual spot.
---
Well, I think some people think it does, I've noticed a slight difference, but don't know if that's my mind seeing it bcos I think it's there, u know? I learnt on my main from making light arms or legs of everything and scrapping them, repeatedly. And funny enough Im sure I learnt dense leather chest from scrapping, but the rest are plans only.
---
The junk item thing is a wierd visual glitch on the alternate junk inventory "tab" Not explaining it well, but there is a way to just switch it back and forth between that view and normal veiw.
---
This is precisely what I was thinking of doing. Blocking in the bench where you initially claim a workshop, lol, guess I won't waste my time trying that
---
What‚Äôs with the mosaic floors? I def would have payed more attention to nukes dragons...
---
Could be that the lvl 50s your seeing are alt characters. I know i had enough from farming on my main to deck out my heavy gunner at 45-50.
---
Also, since i knew i had gear waiting on my alt i scripted all my leveling legendaries. Max scrips waiting for my alt at 50. 20 2 star weap rolls along with what i already had was not hard to deck out without even having to really on vendors that could have duped items.
---
The one I got from the quest was low-level but I was able to craft a level 50 one without issue.
---
They said they wanted a dog and a deathclaw. So I said them. You only need animal friend for the dog, you need Wastland whisper for the deathclaw, it's easier to just have them both on.
---
Its really just a matter of trying it out. I used to use four leaf clover, then i tried critical savvy, when I didn‚Äôt notice much difference between them, I tried neither. Even without any critical fill perks, i still found my criticals were refilling very fast. 15 base luck, +15 from unyielding armor, +any other you might have from armor or chems...your criticals will refill very fast. 
---
Grim reapers sprint is so important to me as a vats user. When its maxed out you almost never have to worry about running out of ap. When you are going through west tek or white springs, or anywhere with lots of enemies, you pretty much aways have ap for vats. The exception would obviously be for large and boss enemies. If you use vats on them for the critical hits, you will tun out of ap unless you switch to kill smaller enemies once in a while. 
---
But their are no wrong builds. Some things may not work as good as others, for different situations. I have had a lot of people criticize my builds in the past, but this is what works very well for me and my play style. I always try there suggestions, and sometimes keep them, but usually end up back with this build. 
---
Usually the criticisms are that I should use dodgy, or maxed out bloody mess. Ive tried both, dont notice much difference with bloody mess, as most things die fast already. And dodgy just kills your vats usage if you are getting hit at all. 
---
I was using level 3 mysterious savior, but it seems that most of the time I die, its from explosions or Mirelurk queen acid squirt, so by the time he shows up to save me, its too late anyway. So I recently switched it out for tormenter. Not enough time to know if it‚Äôs worth it or not.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt get it on release, and $40 felt still to high for the game. I knew it was going to go on sale but I was hoping for it to go down to $15.
---
I would never join a club that would take me as a member....
---
I lucked out, first visit there were crickets in the cave... fighting a ghoul and a glowing wendigo...sigh.  Tossed a grenade from above hoping I'd get credit for the cricket's impending doom but didn't.
---
Somehow I thought they were talking about a legacy laser auto laser. Those are nightmare fuel.
---
Seems like a good SBQ starter. A post some time back mentioned the queen is considered an animal. It may not be bloodied, but that 30% or so damage from hunters is not completely worthless. I think most prefer power attack damage over swing speed though.
---
I'm sure some are.
---
My last one was a diseased vampiric bloodbug in some big building I was in. I had to run to the other side of the building trying to shut as many doors as I could behind me and hide before it fucked off back to where I found it.
---
I thought that too üòÇ

Fss is pricy and precious on a meat hook. +1 str is worth more than agility, but the fss is where the money is at. Nice find. If you plan to use it you should keep it, otherwise you could get a lot better in trade for that thing.
---
just to add and clarify, you only lose some caps and your junk if you die.    
---
It's not a big deal at all so long as you stash any junk you can't afford to lose and you'd have to die a LOT in order for the caps to add up to anything significant.  
---
This is why I personally don't get why people view PvP as "toxic" or "griefing" - those labels might be apt for games that have severe death penalties but fo76 is very casual in this regard.
---
What system do you play on? My husband plays melee, so I can figure out how to work with you if you just so happen to play on PC...
---
Okay, I should explain better.
---
I had the level 50 backpack. That's why I waited to do the quest so I could craft it.
---
I'm between level 75 and 80 now.
---
Suddenly last night, it was down to level 20 backpack and there's no option for me to craft the level 50 one again.
---
Oh wow that's a blast from the past.
---
I noticed the weight of plans really adds up if you don't realize it and wind up carrying a lot of them around.
---
Yes! If I pick up a sledgehammer and have one on me, there could be stages to the jury rigging perk card so it‚Äôs not absolutely broken. 1st star, repairing a weapon/armor piece with another grants a 20% additional condition to the weapon. 2nd, at 30% or so forth. I think it would be an awesome add, instead of constantly breaking down weapons and armor when you have multiple of the same type that could be used like the last games
---
Caught a dude trying to use that tactic with me last night. Is it possible to initiate pVp using this method with pacifist mode on? For the most part i dodged the explosions, but even when i was close i never took damage.
---
The only way you'd ever get bethesda to be okay with this is if it's a rare boss like the SBQ, and it only gives you 5-10 atoms.  Bethesda is just too plain cheep to do anything better.
---
Maybe he just needed the friendly intro! I joined reddit just for the fallout 76 communities here, and still learn something new every time I log in.
---
South of vault 76 is a small pool of water you can jump from, you can add me and I‚Äôll be on in about 1hour
---
Thanks a lot!
---
Thank you! I am trying my best to get more people involved because at the end of the day I do love this game, and playing with my girl and her friends makes it a lot more enjoyable (and at times, hilarious). I am on XB1.
---
Ok thanks
---
Don't spend more than the workshop budget and remember to blueprint it. Building a big dumb house increases the cost to contest and may deter certain PVP players.
---
Np
---
Everquest did this in 1999 with the Veeshan's Peak world zone/Kyrafyrm the Sleeper event, that only happened once per game world, and changed the face of the whole world permanently.
---
If they can do this in 1999, they can do it in 2019
---
Yeah I wouldn't mind having an eyebot or liberator follow me around. 
---
Tamed animals are pets tho.
---
Like a... MOO MOO?
---
In FO76 you have to accept combat also... I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre taking about?
---
What's the song you've got playing?
---
I would have kept my TSE laser pistol lol. Got another later but given the rate they fall apart, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to have a few.
---
Just use free repair kits. You get tons of them if u fight the queen often.
---
I did the sniper troll thing just messing around one night, shot their cow on accident, I felt bad and left lol
---
I don't own the Collectron, but I have this gripe every time I visit a robot vendor. Just tone down the frequency of the dialogue, where it's not talking the whole time I'm trying to buy something.
---
It's a less than one percenter mate, good luck in your grinds
---
doesn't even have to add any carry weight. just something to follow me around not being disruptive would be great.
---
Dam dident know it was that low! Cant find much info on drop rate.
---
Agreed.
---
I've never truly had a toxic/griefing feel from the few PvP encounters I've had. It was actually a learning experience for me last night.
---
Took the Hemlock Holes because I needed acid, and wanted a lot passively. Collected stuff for about 10 minutes without remembering to build a stash and store the junk. Got killed and instantly remembered, lol. Came back once more as I saw the workshop was unclaimed and got killed again. My bad! And well played.
---
Hopped onto another server, claimed the workshop, built a stash, stored my stuff properly, and crouched to remain hidden on the map. Didn't get killed at all that time. Also, the earlier PvP made it more interesting gameplay knowing I needed to watch my back, which is different from my usual needs while playing.
---
100 caps for 1 scrip, so all your caps can buy you three three-star stalker‚Äôs walking canes.
---
Assuming max level, the FSS will make it desirable for someone if you don't have a melee toon to play with it.
---
Tough part with the meat hook and SBQ is you need to be up close and personal with her to deal damage, and the meat hook being an Unarmed weapon type means no power armor.
---
My melee toon is a stealth/bloodied/unyielding type that uses the meat hook as a primary weapon. When I'm at the SBQ fight I put on the HazMat suit and sneak up under her. Needless to say I die about a half dozen times throughout the course of the event...
---
TL;DR - keep it if you have a melee toon to play around with, otherwise hit up the market sub for offers on something that better suits your play style. And make use of the courier service if you have doubts in trade trust, it's free to use
---
I have vision issues as well, I would join in a request to them, it would be nice to be able to see some hud things easier.
---
Hell, I've gotten rad worms from a bullet!
---
Curse the lack of platform cross-play!
---
I was using mostly Super Stims too. Aside from the few diluted I apparently picked up and didn't drop that caused the issue initially, those heal pretty quick.
---
Like the handmade and lever, weirdness.
---
I found a bloodied explosive flamer for 25k Caps a couple months ago. I backed up to get my mule on to transfer caps and some motherf***er bought it whilst I was doing that. Since then I‚Äôve had to use a level 40 super mutants slayer explosive flamer, which is still very powerful but makes me sad knowing how crazy a BE flamer would have been. I now check every vendor with weapons in the hopes that someone will sell one for max caps.
---
Vaccinated perk. Haven't had the worms in a while.
---
This is more for the plasma grenade plan.
---

---
One of my chars has been stuck there for few months now, even since the first purveyor sale because I have several chars and it seemed much easier to just dump all the useless legendaries I've got, to one char.
---
I've gave up on that char for time being, and have desided to move my camp I've not seen in ages, to a lead node little west of that place. Then I can set up vending again and feed the machines, and maybe get little caps whenever I walk to harpers ferry to get 1400 caps and back.
---
I have seen once a temporarely camp very near the station. It had quite affordable scrip legendaries too, and LOTS of them. Brought several but didn't want to be too gready.
---
But really, we've had Purveyor sales before. Not this great, now they are dirt cheap. But still, there's not so much players going to be there. People just come, do their stuff, and leave.
---
My concern stems from experience.  I'm one of the few who routinely runs the Vault 94 missions on all difficulties and man trying to get a server last night stable enough for expert mode was a shit show.  
---
I have 2 full sets of strangler PA, probably over 100 runs in Vault 94.  I can confidently say using this instancing tech in it's current  state as the basis for Wastelanders will lead to backlash just as bad or worse than the one the game got at launch :(
---
You get the repair kits from the Queen and the atomic shop yes, but as another person stated it gives you another reason to pick up weapons instead of scrapping everything. It could just be another card attached to intelligence, except in this one it couldn‚Äôt be used in combination with Weapon Artisan or Fix It Good.
---
How did you get the lvl 50 backpack the first time?
---
Exactly! And add another helpful perk to the game instead of just luck chance to help repair
---
So it's wrong ask for a feature from previous entries in the series? Especially one that can make players more comfortable playing? Quality of Life and all that.
---
Plus, you know, people that are colorblind might have an easier time. Gods forbid something like that happen.
---
congrats man glad we could help üëçüèª
---
That exactly what I thinks gonna happen
---
*whistles* That's either a lot of cooking or a very large wooden house in the making. Or it would be, if they had kept it!
---
Buy the Red Rocket Garage door...   I believe that it was back in the Atomic shop this summer but I was on vacation so I missed it.  
---
Keep my original CAMP in the Mire and just upgrade it.   I had it set up with a tree branch going through the upper floor window and into the floor.   Made a cool feature.   With the changes to CAMP building rules you can't do that anymore...   Bethesda:  please let branches go through windows and doors again....  please....
---
Buy Serum recipies ASAP....
---
Other than these, I've had a pretty good run so far and wouldn't change a thing.
---
I don‚Äôt see them adding NPCs to quests we‚Äôve already done since that wouldn‚Äôt really make much sense , the only way I see them adding NPCs to quests we‚Äôve already done is by replacing the robots on dailies with a human.
---
Thank you for the comment about people complaining to make the raids easier. I am so tired of reading about how people on novice deserve the plans too. No you don't. I earned my armor and mask through trial and error.
---
My friend and I have spent hours going through each section of the vault with a two man team and we still manage to nail novice and standard. It isn't a place to run and gun. It takes strategy and some problem solving. We don't have the best luck with having a four man group, but we still manage to figure it out and help.
---
I would like to mention the complaints about "it is a waste of resources". No. No it isn't. The bulk ammo scrap is enough to replace everything I use and provide enough for me to sell the excess.
---
He said having and that's what I was commenting, not duping them.
---
Agreed- .50 is a do-it-yourself thing. I instantly sell any bulk steel, acid &amp; lead i put up, but actual .50 ammo moves pretty slowly.
---
All good ideas.  
---
I kind of think 20k to move a legendary effect from one item to another though would lead to people all having god tier equipment very swiftly.  As an example I have 4 characters all caps maxed or close, so I could immediately move 6 legendary effects on day 1.  
---
Give me a couple months and every one of my characters would have the best possible gear and the game would be too easy :P
---
Have you got that poison aura mutation , i do and I get a similari experience because the disadvantage of that mutation is you get more diseases.
---
Could you post a link if you still know it? Would like to see it myself...
---
It literally overkill.
---
Let's agree to disagree? I hated that repair system. I never had the spare gun I needed. This way I can repair my gun with an empty paint can I picked up god knows where. That said, if they did your way AS WELL, I wouldn't have any objections. I just don't want to run across a huge map, looking for a spare power fist...
---
The best type of kill, over!!
---
Yep- i know i won't bother to go to it if i check the event and there's only one level 25 there who has no idea what he just got himself into.
---
When you equipped Wasteland Whisperer, did you unequip Animal Friend?
---
Congratulations on playing through and collecting the PA. A dedicated vault dweller you are! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
You are spot on dude. You raise very valid points here. I'm just gonna hope that the next patch and Wastelanders update improves on that tech otherwise I'm gonna have to hide behind my sofa all winter. Can you imagine social media and youtube again? üòëüòï
---
Yep, my camp is close so i hit it every day. It's on the once-a-day timer unless somebody else has already nicked it on that server. 
---
The good one, the aid item, is in the basket- the honey beasts that spawn there only drop the junk item when killed.
---
The enclave uniform and hat counts.
---
Someone has left a gift there for any low levels.
---
They can be duped currently on all platforms. There's nearly one youtube video about them daily, lol.
---
Just pick them up and sell them to vendor bots, they are difficult to use as actual weapons because of their huge explosion range.
---
And they are harmless as they are duped when they are disarmed.
---
Really? I've seen a lot of great ones.
---
I don't think you have the right car. The quest one doesn't have doors on it, if I recall. The bag is inside the vehicle.
---
I love to run solo during the week. We each hop
---
On and do a few events then log off. But on weekends we run together with friends we have made. I find I get griefed more when I‚Äôm solo. When I‚Äôm with our team it‚Äôs usually a pretty fair fight.
---
Of course keep the old system of the paint can and using materials to fix armor/weapons like you said! I actually really like that as well. Totally understand. I‚Äôm saying it would be awesome and make a convenient perk additional to Intelligence especially for whenever you do find one and you‚Äôre not near a workbench and equip the perk card! That way you use your repair kits as last resort
---
Nice job!!
---
You and I stick together like excess adhesive lmao. Do I need to say more?
---
There's always that one guy. You've met him. Keep on keeping on, we know what you meant.
---
I could see them doing it with repeatable quests without any robot NPCs already. Lots of cool quests with hardly any lore explanation in the quest itself. Dailies, events, part 2 of *some* side quests would be a good thing
---

---
 &gt; Nice job!!
---
I'm looking forward to see that as well, bearing in mind that fetch quests are unfortunately going to make somewhat of a return, because it's impossible to make all quests interesting.
---
Which quests are you talking about? Rose is an NPC. She give you quests, so I don‚Äôt know what you mean by this whole ‚Äúno NPC‚Äù business.
---
It's called "good neighbor", it sung by magnolia in FO4.
---
No, so it may or may not work on its own.
---
The mine doesn't do any damage while there's no consensual PvP going on. But I think the residual radiation the mine leaves on the spot for about 10 seconds after it exploded, is actually considered enviromental radiation and can damage players. Particularly bloodied builds.
---
Haven't had a chance to test it and I don't want to try it on randoms so they don't get the wrong idea.
---
I thought it was just bugged out for me.  Ice two scorched which takes like .7 seconds then wait three minutes for two more level 6 scorched to show up?  nah brah
---
i picked it up hoping it would count toward the "loot 1 million pieces of wood" atom challenge, but sadly it didnt
---
Thanks. Although I do need to obtain it still.
---
If only. But I feel like it's good to have limits, no matter what size cup they give me I'll find a way to fill it and ask for more.
---
On PC :(
---
The hero we need
---
"A few bodies in my backyard is different to the mass graves Hitler made"
---
Basically the difference that you're trying to make here.
---
Duped items are still what is making the player-based economy fail at the moment, and player-based economy is all that's left for this game until wastelanders comes out.
---
If you're knowingly trading for a duped weapon/armor piece, you're contributing to the problem.
---
Level 20 is the minimum, and can be crafted up to level 50 (in increments of ten) 
---

---
It's when they are only there to PvP and aren't there to use the workshop and dont do anything with it.  
---
I was showing a low level how to farm 100% fusion cores at a power plant when three PvPs came after us.   I just walked away but they perused me anyways and killed the low level.  
---
Beyond situational issues, there is the problem that typically the first one to shoot wins because of how OP most PvP players are.   There is no skill involved.   
---
It would be a different story if the game entered a modified mode where damage and defense were set the same and it took 5 to 10 solid hits to kill.  Then it would be fun and last more than 30 seconds.    Today it's just a duck shoot....
---
Yeah, I was mindful of it in most shots, but if I had known it would get this much attention I definitely would have done reshoots.
---
okiedokie! added, I'll be on then too so it works, thanks :3
---
I found doing a concrete foundation worked pretty good. I built a large platform, ran out of concrete so finished with the wooden foundation. Decided to move the bungalow to the opposite side and discovered I couldn‚Äôt, had to be on concrete. Swapped the foundation pieces around and that worked.
---
I ended up getting a refund on the bungalow. I enjoy building things and that‚Äôs part of the fun for me and with that I just wasn‚Äôt enjoying it. Conversely, I tried doing a round building and fought with it for hours but that was to be expected. It‚Äôs not an easy thing to do and the pieces we have aren‚Äôt made to do round buildings.  Not one with a roof anyway. The bungalow is something I paid for though. I expected it to not be so buggy.
---
It's connected to the number of players on a server. Juicehead had a video where he showed that being alone on a server made the entire game smoother, combat much "snappier," and the vault raids completely lag free. I think they're using the now freed up survival server space to test Wastelanders out with maxed out player capacity. Hopefully they'll iron it out.
---
Think ive done it in the unstopable suit and top hat, forgot name atm.
---
But you pass up caps by selling legendaries for scrips.  You could be selling those at vendors or to other players for caps instead.
---
The moment we get crossplay and crossaves I'm going to the PC. Just can't let go of all these plans.
---
I picked him up for this reason aswell.     I just needed someone in my base to make it feel more alive.   between the brahmin i have and now my scrap bot i am happy,    Hoping they eventually add a Assaultron That Can Patrol my Base aswell.      Also looking forward to having a follower in "Wastelanders" stay in my base.   Although i am up against the "Budget Limit" so hopefully they increase it or optimize it so i can make them a room for him or her.
---
Not sure about the white wolf one, but the battered fedora works so I don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt.
---
Oh god damn.
---
The static is the sound of the jet on the super sledge. It is one of the reasons I don‚Äôt use my bloodied, fss, +1 strength super sledge anymore. The noise was so annoying.
---
What if I told you they had security people there 3 years+ ago who told them to implement it, even showed them how... but they didnt..
---
Where are you getting them from? Genuinely asking because I never have enough. Selling stuff gets you very little it see like (robot vendors) and events are 100-200 maximum
---
Trilby works as well I believe.  Usually one in the tall building at NAR repair yard in the bog.
---
Yh but you can‚Äôt exactly add new NPCs to established quests like the  mistress of mysteries quests or other side quests it just wouldn‚Äôt make sense , they‚Äôve said wastelanders is a new alternative main quest but I reckon they will do part 2 of quests tbh
---
Yeah, I'm thinking I may just stay where I am (near Whitespring) and hope for the best.
---
Also just as a tip, I went to the abandoned bog town and found a cultist bald at the front desk on the first floor. Not related to the post, but if you want it I found one there.
---
You're completely right.  Less people = less lag.  One of the best tactics to circumvent this was to get your entire group outside of Vault 94, then party up in the main menu after you leave the game, then all 4 jump to survival so there's less people, less lag, and an easier time over all.
---
Civil war top hat
---

---
It's funny knowing how easy this is to fix. Just a pair of snap points in nifscope :(
---
Critical hits get bonus damage as well. Seems obvious, but I always thought the added critical portion was separate from the damage calculation and tacked on at the end.
---
Also, the weak point modifier differs enemy to enemy. Yao Guais only take 25% more damage from a head shot.
---
Used a what?
---
Do you also get a damage boost for using conc fire?  That is plain body shot is 100, conc fire body hit is 120 and headshot 240
---
Gratz on soloing it but casuals go into encryptid with nowhere near the gear or build you used, get wrecked, and then complain it's too hard.  Because after all I should be free to solo everything with my RP noodle cook character modeled after the chef in Diamond City who only speaks Japanese and wears the chefs outfit from meat week with no armor at all and only using meat cleavers for weapons.  
---
You my friend, are no casual.
---
Your build is well min/maxed with literally has no QoL/feed perks (other than 1 rank of pharmacy), a vamp plasma and a **full fucking set of sentinels** (with 3 troubleshooters for ISS to boot!) is not even *remotely* casual.  
---
That's as hardcore min/maxed metagamed out approach as anything.  I guess you believe you are casual because you did this without a god tier weapon even though vamps was the best in slot option for the task at hand by a country mile?!?  
---
So yeah, welcome to the hardcore min/max powergaming club bro because like it or not, you are a member.
---
We never found the body of the Mistress of Mysteries tinkerer/dad. Nor did he get mentioned as being killed I don't think. Most players assume he was burned alive
---
Mmhmm... and I only had 4, I wasn't done with copper, so I was surprised.  I noticed something similar happened another time, with the sword part of the Mistress of Mystery quest, to test the sword with 5 different types of enemies.  I had 2 more to go, killed a Super Mutant, and it registered as finishing the quest.  However, there might have been an additional condition to that, it made a point of saying I killed a SM with it in the upper left corner, maybe the "bonus" was built into the quest and I didn't realize it.
---
Maybe right before I got one extra piece of copper that I didn't notice, it's possible.  Definitely not going to complain though, accident or not!
---
and when you try to make put with the wretched thing...you see the mouth full of parasitical worms reaching for you.
---
Because of all the rads
---
So that explains why I randomly fill up on scrip when I thought I still had space left.
---
Don't fucking bother with heavy guns.  Too much work.  Just go commando with the handmade and never look back.
---
Wait is disadvantage more disease or just the fact you have to have diseases for it to work?  News to me if more diseases!
---
And if you bought the previous three before the bundle came out, you have to re-buy the bundle at full cost to get UV and IR.
---
Hey man, hope this helps:
---
\-You can't increase your stash space. Get rid of the stuff you don't use, you can't hoard in this FO. You can also get some perks into the mix, Traveling pharmacy and carry all meds on you, bandolier an carry all ammo, batteries included an carry all energy ammo and fusion/plasma cores, thru hiker and carry all food and drinks. Aside from that you can get the free backpack (30 weight units more), tadpole backpack (60 units more) and tadpole+high capacity mod (120 units more). Max strength helps, being bloodied with an unyielding set of armor will get you even more strength, strength = carry capacity. Armor with legendary weight reductions effects or carry capacity mods also helps. **Don't bulk All junk**, only aluminum and lead weight less when bulked. Don't keep junk you don't need, better to get it if needed than to have no space. Craft stuff that can be crafted and you know you are going to use, like bullets or fluxes, better to have the bullets with bandolier than the junk. Also, when doing the daily sale sell heavy stuff first. In general, get rid of all the non essentials, sort by weight.
---
\- You can craft the default vendor, the vendors you see in the atom shop are skins.
---
\- Trying a search on reddit or asking people in game might help. Don't know of a better place. Some of the wikis help me out from time to time. Also some of the streamers are cool and help you out if you ask in chat. I follow Sabahe on twich and he is always willing to help.
---
Good luck man.
---
It's an exploit of being super over encumbered, and then trying to pick a throwable item up
---
They'll load up on something like dirty water until their at MAX LVL of being over encumbered. At this point they throw a cleaver, tomahawk or drop a mine. When they go to pick it up, instead of it going into their inventory the game barfs and creates many duplicate versions of whatever the thing was thrown or dropped
---
To my knowledge there is no XP gain from this, but there are materials that can be scrapped or sold
---
Pacifist mode
---
I promise I am not accidentally shooting people.
---
Oh that one is easy to get. I live south of Helvetia. Thank you very much.
---
I tried the WW Fedora, doesn't count. I use the Enclave Hat since I hoard those quest gear things.
---
Thank you.
---
Thank you. I didn‚Äôt know there was such a thing.
---
&gt;One time early on, my friend and I went to another player's camp and thought we were slick by stealing from the Stash Box. We ran back to friend's camp and deposited everything, and attempted to do it multiple times before realizing we were stealing from ourselves. Good times.
---
That was my first CAMP interaction I had. It was funny as hell. I didn't know anything about this game and all the mechanics. No friends in game. No yt help. I was scared as hell. I stole just one small junk item first, just to find out if I become WANTED player or not. I waited for about 10 or 15 minutes because I thought that the owner of the CAMP get notified if somebody steal something. After the 15 minutes I took everything from "his" stash. I was walking slowly to my CAMP. I was so scared. I was hiding in bushes and behind tree trunks just to avoid being spotted. It was one of the best experiences in this game I ever had. 
---
And look at me now. Few high level characters. End game builds. One shots everything that moves. Game was better back then. Not knowing everything makes your life/game more enjoyable that knowing it all. 
---
I wish every year we get another version of Fallout 76. Fallout 77. Fallout 78 and so on. Every year with big ass map to explore. Every year with new perk cards, builds, weapons, stuff to collect. Every year with another big piece of Fallout story. It would be perfect. I wish I had Rick Sanchez multiverse portal gun just to go to the universe where this is the reality. 
---
The answer to your question is: Caps. I would start collecting Caps from the first day. I pushed the story and side quests to fast the first time I played and I forgot(i didnt know much) about resources and game economy.
---
Oic thank you
---
Someone else mentioned the top hat as well. Going to try that. Thank you.
---
Bowler hat should definitely be counting. I‚Äôve used it for the challenge where you have to craft lead champagne wearing formal clothes
---
Giving is the real end-game.
---
Yeah as I said , that might be an expansion we see in a part 2 of the quests , but I‚Äôm on about them adding NPCs to the current quest .
---
In that case I fear the challenge is glitched.
---
The reason so many people miss humans and non feral ghouls and such is because literally nothing you do in the game as it now matters at all to anyone in any capacity. 
---
Woo, we created a vaccine for the scorch, except it does literally nothing at all because we couldn't catch it before anyway and every single other thing in world that it could help is dead. 
---
Woo, we sealed the fissures, except it does literally nothing because  it doesn't even reduce the spawns of SBs and also everyone who we could save by doing it is already dead. 
---
 
---
It is incredibly hard to remain invested in a story or world when you know that nothing you do matters at all and will change nothing for anyone except that one time that Rose the robot gets excited about being able to broadcast her ramblings to literally just you and only when you choose to listen to them.
---
I have never done any of these things. Maybe I should clarify: a passerby has never killed me. BUT they have injured me which is hard in the wilderness because you don‚Äôt always have Stimpacks.  But thank you for this nice list. :)
---
This is so funny. 
---
You have to call him a Food Build.
---
VERY NICEEE
---
Your chance of getting more diseases increase when you have the mutation , but you also need diseases for the mutation to work so it‚Äôs a catch 22 kinda
---
Because speeding up the game by fast traveling means you spend less time traveling and grinding. Its basic mmo stuff
---
But you can have consequence without actual human NPCs. I agree there is no consequence now... but those two things are mutually exclusive.
---
I have never accepted combat. I am not a PVP person at all. Other players have shot at me and significantly reduced my health. I run away from them and they usually don‚Äôt follow me. But it definitely happens. In ESO, you cannot be injured by a fellow player at all. I don‚Äôt know how FO76 functions, but I have definitely been shot by other players.
---
:)
---
Now I want to see how peoples armed with meat hooks headshots the queen. Please Internet make it happend.
---
I could check crafting level on the fixer. On handmades they drop at level 15. I have a furious lvl 15 in storage. Fixer is a combat rifle. Bloodied is what you want at low levels, like a level 10 sniper rifle is nice for quick xp.
---
I gave mine to a friend and he stopped playing, but had a level 20 drop so kind of around there. That gun will get you to 45 easy.
---
I agree the guy that gets the first shot on target often wins but I think saying there's no skill involved is a cop out when the real problem is often strategy and tactics.
---
Yes the PvP guy will be immaculately geared with a very specific build but if you can force the conflict into an area with tight corridors and a lot of cover you can mitigate a lot of the other guys advantages and possibly get the drop on the other guy(s).
---
Fighting a superior foe in an open field plays to their strengths so don't complain when you lose.  Learn so next time you don't fight impossible fights in the first place ;)
---
I hope so at this point.
---
This sounds really good.
---
Has anyone run into the bug where when you load into the game,  you can't move because half your keyboard keys aren't working.  My controller was disconnected and controllers are turned off in the settings so it isn't those.  I would have to close and restart the game to get the keyboard keys back.
---
Except that the empty weapon bug ALSO happens in NW mode, with weapons I've never fired. It's a legit bug. User error CAN happen, but this happens too frequently. I'd estimate 10% of my NW deaths happen because of switching weapons and coming up empty on something that has not been fired once in the round. (i.e. a completely fresh weapon with plentiful ammo)
---
That and consuming something from a can should produce an empty scrapable can...need more lead for bullets and stuff.
---
Winning
---
I love this response because you are right. When we were all new, fresh, naive, and still figuring things out, it was the best experience. I remember my friend storing all of his junk into the Overseer box, and 30 minutes later, wondering where all his loot had went. That was back when we thought it was mandatory to lock our camps and store all crafting stations inside.
---
Of course we got the warning to leave the area, but we were working on killing the Q, and didn‚Äôt have a lot of time left.
---
Really would be nice to have a 1 pt perk card where you don‚Äôt lose diseases at all.  Could be an interesting build.
---
Fantastic idea!!!!
---
Give them a break, this technology is new and no one else has it. (ignores every other game with dungeons instanced for players especially MMOs or games like Warframe and Destiny)
---
What about stabilised with an assassin's minigun?
---
I used to be of this mindset too until shortly after the second meat week, at which point I just decided to experiment by saying yes to team invites and see what happened. So far I have nothing bad to report and I've met a few nice people who wanted to share perk benefits with me. I think most just do want a free fast travel spot rather than someone to tag along on quests but I am okay with that. I've even invested in Strange in Numbers and Inspirational perks, which are great replacements when you need to ditch Lone Wanderer. If you want to do it, just give it a try and you might be pleasantly surprised. :-)
---
They basically confirmed that canning stations and ammo converters will be in the Atomic shop.
---
Wait, since when was FO4 blue? Could've sworn it was green too.
---
Its sad that an advertised online game is best played....without players.
---
You are doing something to be aggressive. Currently the only way to harm someone is if they are hostile to you. I could stand in front of you and shoot you in the face and it would do nothing. That is the way the game works. You must be wanted, or perhaps you took a workshop (which it tells you initiates PvP). Or you accidentally killed someone. Ooooor you are on a team and your teammate initiated PVP and therefore he brought you in.. ooooor you listened to hunter/hunted radio to start PVP. 
---
Bottom line- you can‚Äôt just kill anyone you want in adventure mode. PVP is only when you do an action to initiate.
---
I can't I'm at work...
---
Since you can only get it from purveyor no. If it dropped in the wild than yes.
---
Duuuuh
---
This is probably the best 'we need' post I've seen. I really hope this becomes a thing now
---
My legendary armor kept reviving me when I tried to help a friend get that revive challenge...   
---
\[leap to my death\]... oh. Not dead. Sorry. Hold on just a sec... I'll be dead in just a minute after I re-climb that tall thing over there...
---
Everyone here says 556 sells(1cap each) but Ive leveled an alt from 10-25 with thousands of 556 in vendor and nothing sold. All my other alts have 556 in vendors, theres always 556 in my main vendor and Ive played since launch and had maybe 3 people actually buy it and maybe sold under 2k rounds.
---
Janets soft serve, run along the road westish past the bus, responder vendor bot can spawn there, random assortment of somewhat rare clothes.  In the other direction from janets a random spawn on side of the road (you‚Äôll see a skeleton in road you‚Äôre near it) for a chance at civil war reenactor who can have outfit plans.
---
Crevasse damn for witch costume.  Across the way a bit up on a cliff I‚Äôve found skeleton costume.  Plans that is.
---
Many events have random outfit drops.  I got a forest camo jumpsuit from fly swatter and about fell off the couch in shock.  Savage divide events give 3 at once (bos whitespring and I forget the 3rd jumpsuit).  I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs by region or event.  I got a vtu baseball cap from feed the people before.
---
Also turning in tech data you can get some BOS gear I‚Äôd label as uncommon.
---
Hope that helps.  Server hop and events for the TLDR!
---
Yes, but I am not an ass about it. If the person drops a bag I will usually throw Stimpaks, ammo for whatever gun they used, water and Radaway into it. I don't like it, I just want the challenge for 76 wanted players.
---
&gt; I honestly believe Wastelanders will be delayed because of issues like that
---
And that would be 100% completely acceptable.
---
Only Animal Friend is required in order to tame any animal. Wasteland Whisperer is just for pacifying.
---
You are right about different perk ranks giving different chances for different creatures:
---
Rank 1: Brahmin, Mole Rat, Mirelurk, Vicious Dog, Radstag, House Cat, Wolf, Rabbit, Chicken, Attack Dog, Radrat Pup, Opossum, Beaver.
---
Rank 2: Mirelurk Hunter, Yao Guai, Mirelurk King, RadToad, Snallygaster
---
Rank 3: Deathclaw, Megasloth
---
You can still get lower-rank creatures with rank 3 equipped, but your chances for a specific one are much better when you equip the proper rank.
---
And do you actually Cap the workshop when you are done? Do you try to defend it if others come calling?
---
True, but this only reinforces my point.    
---
The instancing tech needs to be refined such that it doesn't lag even when the server is full.  I don't know how hard that might be but given MMO's can host thousands of players with less or even no lag, I have to believe that fo76 with its 24 player cap per server can find a way.
---
The whole your the last hope for the region thing could have been way better served by there being not no one alive but only like a few very small hold out communities left that have had to isolate themselves in hiding due to their entire fighting forces being wiped out by scorched. 
---
Like four or five people from each faction held up in one last stronghold and unable to even try to fight back anymore. really sell the abject despair they have as food, water, power, medicine, and ammunition all slowly run out due to them being unable to even try to scavenge for more without being overrun by scorched.
---
There are worse ways of spending 23 bucks. You could by a nice dinner for yourself but itll be a one time event. You'll get hungry again. You can buy a whole heep of really old games but none of which would be online. For 23 bucks, its pretty worth the return.
---
Wow forces you to give up your freedom though, communism detected.
---
that would be a great idea if survival was still a thing that existed.   
---
Server hopped about 5 times last night, never found a server stable enough for expert mode in 94.  Eventually people had to bounce because they have lives and if wastelanders shares this level of headaches it will be a shit show :(
---
Yup and I hope they have the sense to put them in for free and sell skins, but the fridge and collectron have taught me otherwise...
---
I don't. I have no interest in PvP in this game. Not survival mode, not Nuclear Winter, nothing. I have remained in pacifist mode. So I have no interest in hunting down wanted people. Especially knowing that players like to use dirty tactics like staying stealthed and using a wanted character as bait.
---
At least in Nuclear Winter there are rewards for PVP... that's how I like my player vs player, structured and contained. I dislike when people try to force those who don't want pvp to participate by gaming the system... If you want to kill each other fine, go do it in an area designated for that.
---
I have a story like that! My lower level friend was AFK with a wanted 170something near him. I went over to see what was up, and the dude was butt naked asking my buddy to kill him. He was there for a few minutes before I showed up and agreed to kill him. 
---
Afterward he walked over to my friend (still AFK) and says "IDK why you didn't want to kill me but okay." 
---
The entire thing was sketchy as fuck.
---
It still used to though, but only to the extent an online rpg can. Like, killing the queen ends the spread of the plague. You getting the vaccine stops you from being infected etc
---
Tbh I have a feeling they will only add 2-3 new ppl.
---
Grats. It was surprisingly easy to solo for me too. I think her HP increases with more players. I just grabbed the three pylons and did as much damage as I could before I died. Only one other dude showed up. I took off around 25% of its HP per death. Only died 5 times or so. I just wish it did not take flux to spawn her.
---
Never delete an alt. I've lost so many ranks of legendary player levels just from dumping alts to start over.
---
Helps alot thank you.
---
The amount of white/light blue HUDs will be insane
---
West-Tek is usually good for 1-2 Legendary enemies. Huntersville I've not had so much luck.   
---
The Whitespring usually has a couple, more so at the Golf Club than the rest. They seem to be lower level lately.   
---
Harper's Ferry usually has a Legendary or two, as well as the Barrows.   
---
I am also having better luck with random encounters, it does seem like they have sprinkled the Legendary spawn points around rather than anchoring to specific locations.
---
This would absolutely destroy merchant characters.
---
You're free to have your freedom. I want the freedom to not be around you. Sounds more like you want to strip me of my freedom to have fun in a video game, you fascist fuck.
---
See? I can throw words around too.
---
im totally ok with them delaying until they can get it perfect!
---
we dont need any more bad press
---
i giggled
---
Sounds like you just griefed some poor noob OP
---
For me the games a bit on and off. I love the community and the game itself but I like to wait for major updates until going back to it. Hopefully wastelanders will give me hours of fun
---
when an area is nuked, after a certain period of time the nukezone will fade away on that server
---
there is a period of time where you can still get flux and the enemies are glowing but the area isnt irradiated
---
if thats the case at the golfclub it somehow leads to the spawns beeing either eyeboys or protectrons i think i even once saw an army of robobrains
---
it can be a good way to get hands on low level legendaries
---
A joke rare spawn. They were all diseased, right? They had a virus badumtss
---
I bet you never played it
---
At lvl 30, all the way in the Mire?
---
I went to the Mire at lvl 30 because that's where the main quest sent me
---
I thinks thats a great idea
---
I got them randomly on my commando. Didn‚Äôt know what they were when I first got them. I almost traded them before I looked up what they were.
---
Find the marine combat helmet
---
I wasn't accusing, it's easy to do accidentally, but if you turn on pacifist they won't be able to kill you unless you engage them or take a workshop.
---
I think it may be that you can‚Äôt sympathize with a robot as well as you can with a human.
---
It's kind of amusing now... fast travel to Watoga...wait for dead Scorchbeast to fall from the sky. :)
---
you'd be surprised. personally I just ignore all attempts to communicate with me.
---
it's easy to spot bots based off the pattern of their movement. but I wouldn't be surprised if someone got fed up with farming and figured they could code a bot.
---
This is by far better than any of what I put.
---
\&gt;  completely ignored my attempts to communicate, Emotes, trade invite, group invite, voice chat 
---
\&gt;  I managed to kill it by getting inbetween it and some scorched 
---
I am wondering why you thought that player needed griefing. Couldn't you just leave him be and play the way he wants?
---
Never saw any of them glowing, I didn‚Äôt think to check and see if snaptail had turned into its purple counterpart(don‚Äôt remember the name) First FO I‚Äôve ever played. I only dabbled on the edges of nuke zones a couple times....tag a glowing bloated and draw him out. So I‚Äôve never been around when one ends. Anyway thanks for the input. XB1 if it matters
---
Bowler works not bowler-hat. Also white wolf fedora works.
---
This is a good QOL suggestion.
---
I am not the one with the expectation
---
Assassin's is a garbage legendary, you're better off with a mutant's minigun.  Even then, mutant's is a shit legendary too.
---
Not yet, "Beth is aware and working on it". That's the last comment on this bug.
---
I wouldn't sell to vendor level 10 explosive laser pistol that was my first explosive roll, this is the single thing I really screwed up
---
Lmao. And serendipity!
---
Stealth archer is coming, stealth archer always comes.
---
Between the name and the very slow nature of how it acted, just struck me as odd. Like it seemed to move in straight lines and at times seemed entirely focussed on loot. The fire fight I watched it get into started because it walked up to a container right next to a lvl40 scorched.
---
If the person is really beggin me for the workshop usually I let them keep it, but I'll still take the junk they dropped in the bag.
---
And yes, the main reason I take workshop is for pvp, so of course I show up when somebody's trying to take it.
---
You have a link? I haven't seen this and would like to read what they are thinking.
---
Saved the yellow baseball bat my buddy gave me
---
Agreed. I slept on them and then loved it when I saw it in a camp. Hopefully it will pop back in the store.
---
Rookie mistake. I once leveled a new dude to 15 just to buy the handmade gun plans since my main was outside the level range. Trained him up, spend at least 3 sessions farming harpers ferry vendor to finally get the plans. When I went to transfer the plans to a friend, to give to my main.. I learned the plans instead of dropping them... I felt dumb as dirt
---
The Evacuator Armor should of had a Drill
---
I totally understand that. But it only has consequence for your little bubble, and nothing for the overall world. It has the same consequence as headcanon, which is none.
---
That's true. I didn't get building mods in FO4 until less than a year before FO76 (and played since release). It was about creating something great *depsite* the limitations.
---
Anything that can keep the food from spoiling is good. I can‚Äôt wait until they add it in. I mean it makes sense that they would do this someday.
---
ree
---
go ravens
---
4 was green
---
Yeah i mean thats the point though, making them human NPCs makes them more relatable, easier to imagine yourself in their situation and more willing to help them
---
Go dig through the old Into the Vaults, back to the one where they first announced repair kits. In the same paragraph they talked about adding "cool things requested by the community" such as "a way to send scrap directly to your stash, refrigerators, ammo converters and canning stations". Judging by how most of those were added to the shop, I expect the same for the rest as well.
---
Several months now, the chance to get one is 0.01%
---
Well when you make dramatic video number 2 you will remember to turn it off :p
---
Somehow I think Bethesda will make this cost more than it gives.
---
BGS already said that NPC's are going to "infest" the map.
---
I have always wanted to sell meat at my camp because it's what my character is built around.  Not really possible at this time.  Also I love canning in real life - so this would be a win win win for me.  You're amazing.
---
All of the fallout 3 dialogue choices you make eventually boil down to who you put in the reactor and it doesn't really change or affect anyone at or after that point.
---
It very well could mean that every raider you see will shoot you on site if you killed their leader, or quite the opposite; they'll now be passive if you work with them.
---
Either way you have no way of know, nor do I, until it comes out.  I get you don't have very high expectations and that's why you're being so negative, but all your implications are just guessing at what it'll be like.  Neither of us know.
---
it's entirely possible that someone is using AI learning to create a bot. "moving in straight lines" is kinda vague but checks out.
---
I don't see its practical use, however. the really valuable stuff is only found through combat.
---
That much?
---
Breh. You just wasted a noob. Holy shit. Fucking loool
---
The game would so so much exceptionally better if you could learn to craft your own repair kits.
---
I get Rad Worms all the time and on top of that the gouls always break my legs. It‚Äôs very annoying.
---
I built my character originally as a shotgun character but when the TSE nerf came I had to completely adjust to a commando auto rifle character.   That only took me about 40 levels to adjust.  Ugh!
---
Is there a "tier list" of super rare outfits I should be looking out for? I'm afraid I'll get something super rare and end up selling it since I have no idea what's rare and what's not
---
Are you vatsing them out of the air? Or is that not possible? If possible, something with less vats cost so you  vats them out of the air
---
consoles exist, ya mong
---
Some poor kid playing with a controller. He probably thought " oh no, this guys a griefer. Better ignore him" and sure enough you killed him.
---
Every GOOD fallout game*
---
i guess something like a pipe pistol should work they have a high firerate even when they are semi auto but over all id say you shouldnt rely on such a tactic to pvp unless you are very very skilled
---
OP SCUM CONFIRMED lol jk still a dick move
---
In real life or the game?
---
Under challenges
---
My main weapon is a prime Ultracite Gatling Laser, Executioners, FFR, and 90% reduce weight. 
---
The executioners part may turn off people, but once the queen drops to half, the damage goes up to the stratosphere. Until I find a teo shot with the same effects, I aint letting this one go.
---
You bet.
---
Ahhh... Is that confirmed (and is it supposed to be like that ie. not a bug)? The reason I ask is I'm sure I read a post by someone saying that they had both a rad toad and a deathclaw as pets (but equally with this game `that` may have been a bug.
---
This is the best idea I've heard in a while
---
I pick up junk off of people in Workshops and sell it to reach my cap limit on all my characters every day.  It's suprisingly easy to get about 9k every day.
---
Set up my damn park cards correctly.
---
You will save thousands of caps if you just go to lucky hole mine with an excavator suit on.   1000+ lead if you have the acid for it, then just scrap every weapon/armor piece you see and you'll have plenty of steel.
---
hi, go to morgantown and check out fraternity row, the 2nd dorm has a room with a super fan of all things nukacola, there you will find many varities of cola
---
also, there is a nuka cola factory, and lots to be found there too!
---
Awesome idea, passing this along.
---
Everywhere. I‚Äôm constantly picking them up. So much that I‚Äôll sometimes drink 4-5 at a time just to lower weight. 
---
Look in places that may have held lots of people at once. That‚Äôs the best advice I got. I actually thought they buffed them, who knows.
---
If you enter someone else‚Äôs workshop, does this mean they can kill you? Even if you are buying from their vending machines?
---
I‚Äôm on XB1, but really appreciate the offer! Maybe some day...
---
I wholeheartedly agree. It's going to be even tougher to try and get those rare plans and recipe.
---
Okay thank you
---
Ya my PS4 performance has been pretty crap lately. Choppy, lag when changing weapons, rubber banding, buildings not loading in, etc. I really hope it gets fixed in the future because it makes gameplay pretty frustrating.
---
It concerns me that this game has been out so long and still runs like crap so much of the time. Opening my pip boy and map STILL causes my game to freeze for a second or two. Obviously not as bad as launch (when the game would completely lock up) but very unpolished for a AAA release.

 &gt; Awesome idea, passing this along.
---
Same issue, both sides, but its ONLY F076. None of my other games or apps have an aspect problem (xbox)
---
man just mind your own business geez, not everyone want to interact with other players
---
Thanx I‚Äôll check it out tomorow ..
---
yup vatsing them out of the air is the idea, for this reason I'm focusing two of my possible options on what Im guessing are the the cheapest action points for vats cost weapons, the auto 10mm and auto pipe pistol, besides that the only reason that i didnt include less vats legendary higher on the legendarily list is because the auto pistols are already really cheap vats weapons, and I shouldnt need to expend my whole ap bar just to shoot a grenade so Id prefer to save the legendary slot for something more usful
---
Its possible.  Sometimes i go up on my roof and just hurl them and shot'm for fun.  kinda like fireworks
---
If the queen is out of rads, you can use radshield and not take any rads from the queen. It lasts for 18 minutes or longer with chem fiend. The annoying parts is server hopping for the strangler bloom to craft the radshield.
---
We've shared this suggestion with the team! Thanks for posting!
---
I've encountered that few times.. Just bots
---
The vault raids had large hordes of enemies on screen at one time for a significant portion of the mission, even if you played them solo.  That undoubtedly contributed to the lag.  I imagine Wastelanders will have far less action like that going on.  Also, they know how bad they failed the first time and how poorly it was received.  I believe if it's a problem that Bethesda can throw a little money at by choosing a performance option from AWS that involves running fewer virtual servers per server to improve performance they will do it.
---
Updated my PS4 with SSD a couple weeks back and it made a huge difference in load time
---
Just make sure to have the PS4 Installation file (not the update file) on a USB stick when you put in the new drive
---
5 mins to swap drive, 10 mins to setup new system, an hour to d/l the friggin game...
---
Us PC players can at least change it manually. I have mine changed to a nice white color. Works wonders for the pip boy light.

Reason I suggested it is you don't always have a full AP bar

I would've kept all the bloodied and explosive energy weapons I dropped, gave away or sold dirt cheap.
---
I've encountered this myself, it was easily 25 or so Eyebots. Saved the video of it, as it was hilarious.
---
That's because the others ran off the cliff and killed themselves like lemmings.... Lol at least that's what happens for me in that perch. I only have to watch the right side as the left usually self eliminates ü§£
---
Haha, love this one .. gotta try that love-tap
---
It is a bummer that those are harder to gain but for me it‚Äôs more about the activity. The place is huge, the event is fun, and it has a degree of difficulty. I love doing the activity even when I fail it.
---
Good story, also short ..
---
Also you won't be "wasting" the legendary slot, legendaries come in 3 columns. The less vats cost in in the third tier, the most useless of tiers. It's probably the best 3rd perk for most guns
---
OK good....I thought I was just going crazy...or delirious
---
Hey just wanted to let you know I got my new monitor and 144hz works fine for me in fallout.
---
Specs
---
Ryzen 5 2600 4ghz OC
---
MSI GTX 1660
---
Teamforce 3200mhz OC 16g ram
---
Monitor is Acer Predator XB127
---
If you have the tricentenial edition you can craft the costume that came with it, it's a star-striped USA themed tuxedo and top-hat
---
Agreed. All I would have changed would have been a server wide notice that it has started.
---
Obviously, but that shouldn't be the case. Players shouldn't be able to damage your gear while you're dead, that's not a feature.
---
Is the Collectron Mark II (Android version) in development?
---
i understand what you mean, being as I'm an explosive character, I have 59 plasma grenades, 54 cryo grenades, 36 pulse mines, dozens of frags and other grenade/mine types so I rely on them pretty often, I have 5 perk points into explosives and when I'm farming ammo fac I regularly get raided by other players, most of them higher level than my 36, and without good legendary armor or legendary weapons at my level, the explosives work pretty well tbh
---
The BOS hood also has a chance to spawn at Appalachian Antiques. Found one a few weeks ago.
---
I‚Äôd pay 50 easily and up to 100 for violet.
---
Generally 100-150/piece on PC.
---
But not time...that's the balance. I'd rather go kill the queen and spend my caps on ammo.
---
I've heard one should install a floodlight next to the turret to extend the turret's range. Have you tried that?
---
If it's not popping it might be the event that's not giving you challenge credit. I wasn't getting any credit when I did, heart of the enemy, buried with honor, chow line and possibly more, but I was getting credit when I did leader of the pack and wolf horde.
---
Edit: I was wearing the tuxedo and tuxedo hat and then the silver shroud and silver shroud hat.
---
According to a [comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dhco2s/master_thread_for_the_dataminer_ama_oct_13th/f3mp90z/) in the recent data mining thread, the perk increases damage by a small amount (1-3%).
---
This is a good point, thank you!
---
The game seems to be fond of re-spawning me in the rads even if the queen is out of the rads on death, so I'll have to keep my HazMat suit with me either way.
---
well i never tried it tbh was just a guess however if you can defend from higher levels with that tactic thats impressive man respect üëçüèº
---
Would be interesting, but how would players writhing the world share that home? 
---
Might have to either one spot for players, like camps where you can choose to either leave or stay if someone has that spot. Or have to implement some sort of Instancing technology
---
IIRC, last I bought flux, it was around 100 for stable violet.
---
On PC, I think I would probably kill them then immediately Alt+F4.  Not sure what the console equivalent to that would be. 
---
 All three times I have seen a wanted person near me, I hung around them for a couple of minutes and eventually their teammates appeared.  All three instances would have been traps I think.
---
As far as looking at a location, the only place that spawns rare outfits in the world is Fort Defiance. There are 3 places on the 3rd floor where rare asylum outfits can spawn. Youtube can help you here. Any other outfit laying in the world can easily be found. 
---
You've already received good advice on the outfits from the traveling responder vendorbot, BoS, and halloween costumes.

The civil war plans can spawn at these locations, but only the ones in Forest, Toxic Valley, and Savage divide. The markers in the Mire and Savage divide can spawn the trick-or-treater: [https://i.imgur.com/WHGtVHb.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/WHGtVHb.jpg)

Yes. A cool down to match encrypted would be fine, even a card like nukes and encrypted would be fine. Please let us initiate it again that‚Äôs all.

It takes me a whole 10 minutes of going through lucky hole mine and grabbing ore, maybe 5 more getting it all turned into lead, and every bit gives me experience.  I always have acid on hand so I never have to worry about it, same with steel.
---
In total it takes me maybe 20 minutes to make almost 10k 5.56
---
20 minutes?  Or 10k caps?  I'd rather spend 20 minutes getting the ore lmao
---
The OP suggested 1k ..  I think that is too low :)

Can can be any aluminum or standard can found in the world, or craftable with metal + lead (same amount as when junk is scrapped).

The other day it became available and no one bothered with it. There were quite a few 200+ players on the server at the time. I thought that was very strange.
---
I should edit my post. Public announcement is a great addition.
---
hey im always looking for people to play with im in the est coast and usually play after 6pm add me on discord TEKYTECH#9464
---
I do it all the time with events where i dont want to one shot enemies, or, when i want to speed up the explosion delay. 
---
Fun for ghits and shiggles.
---
Im a vats bloodied sneak rifle build with some ap regen gear. Using my lever or handmade i have no prob running out of ap to vat shot them.
---
Personally dragon is so slow and ammo is very heavy, i think you would be better off with a lever or combat rifle with scopes for accuracy. Use .45 on those and save your 5.56 for your auto handmade. 
---
You can only loot world objects every 20 hours. Did you grab them in an earlier play session? Also run around Whitesprings, lots of Nuka Colas all over the resort, the Quantums are like an Easter egg hunt. Plus they have a REALLY NEAT Nuka cola soda shop upstairs, I spent a lot of time just hanging out with Bubbles
---
So, something is off on this post...Either the person that dropped the first nuke had no idea where to drop the nuke (leave dropsite v9 out of the zone) so you can fight the SBQ out of the zone OR nuke 2 got dropped over dropsite v9 where the fight was taking place.....If you were fighting the SBQ out of the zone then the second nuke is not going to kill all of you if it was dropped leaving dropsite v9 out of the zone....So, were you fighting the SBQ in the nuke zone?  OR  Did the 2nd nuke get dropped over dropsite v9?  If they dropped it on top of you that is just a dick move....If you were fighting the SBQ in the nuke zone then the person who dropped the first nuke is a moron and needs to learn where to drop the nuke.
---
nuka and nuka-cherry are relatively common.  Quantum, not so much.
---
There are others, but outside of the WS vendor, I've only seen them in the nuka super fans dorm room.
---
Man, I really hope they put those on sale because everyone is refusing to buy them.
---
Yea i tried the TSE laser pistol when i looted it from a fat ghoul in WS, the thing broke after ten shots lol, I sold it immediately to bot Friedrich üòÇü§Æ
---
As a total CAMP junkie, I am all for ANY additional ways to decorate/create/build in this game....would love to have some kind of instanced bunker or pre-war house or even some kind of industrial building to build inside of with less limitations.
---
I really like the ESO method whereby there are many instances of the same house (so everyone could theoretically own it), but you can travel to your friend's version if you're in a party/on friends list/have permissions/etc.
---
I would not have purchased the game.  This is not, and will never be, a Fallout game. This is some other type of game that (mis)uses the Fallout IP.
---
That‚Äôs a bummer. Maybe they were working on something else? Last night it popped up in the middle of some of my team launching nukes so only half of our team could show up for it. It‚Äôs a big team effort and not everyone on the server will be ready when it pops up.
---
The NPC settlements are going to be instanced to each player just like the vault raids are instanced to each team, it would be poo poo easy to just slap a second cell with some set structures and a workshop in it in there.  
---
all the tech is already done if they can perfectly track the wildly various different locations of every players unique camp and all the crazy intricate shit we fill them with, they can sure as hell keep track of one set location that never changes.
---
Sweet! Now us cooks will be able to sell our goods. Gonna have to figure out what else should go in me Slocum's Joe
---
&gt;writhing?
---
No. You misunderstand. Pacifist mode just means you cannot deal damage to other players. You enable pacifist mode to prevent yourself from accidentally shooting someone to initiate PVP. It has no effect on whether you are engaged in PVP in a workshop (besides meaning you cannot fight back)
---
I think you are confusing a workshop with a camp. A camp has vending machines and entering a camp does not initiate any sort of PVP.
---
I occasionally buy flux of all types at 100 caps or less, but I regularly see it listed between 80 and 150.
---
Does this happen even if you're in Pacifist mode?
---
Maybe I'm an aggressive casual or lazy min maxer then. :)
---
More fair to say that anyone with an interest can start with troubleshooter in each slot, a vampire weapon weapon with high rate of fire and tuning their perks. I'm not certain adrenaline ever fired off, I'm positive better critical, four leaf clover, concentrated fire were useless. I'm using batteries included because I'm carrying tons of ammo for lots of weapons. There are no gates for the perks ... everyone gets them.
---
You do not need to be a bloody meathook to do hard content.
---
Exactly what i was thinking of when i posted this actually, well MMOs in general anyway.
---
There were reports of several AI players some months ago, people assumed it was Bethesda testing stuff in preparation for human NPC's if I remember correctly.
---
Both Nukes had V9 in them. 
---
Here is the zones first one is the right one and the second one was the left one.
---
https://imgur.com/a/sM9pbJw
---
Huh, haven't had this happen or seen any other mention of it. At least they're pretty cheap to craft if it is borked but still.
---
Love it!
---
There is a video of someone absorbing every STR alcohol and chem and one-shotting the Queen with a critical VATS sneak attack.
---
Huh maybe I need someone to show me more lead deposits in there.
---
I'm rarely making 556 anyway ... all plasma (and ultracite but those aren't gated on lead either as much as flux)
---
I know what you mean, I certainly dont think its a wasted legendary slot and it's one I would look for on any of my primary rifles since the ap cost for those weapons are really high, but on the really niche sidearm used only for vatsing grenades, which should at most use up half my ap bar before I trigger the grenade explosion, I rate it 4th most useful behind higher vats hit chance, ffr and explosive, though I did mention already I dont remember the teirs for legendaries off the top of my head so that why I reasoned the idea sidearm would include the 1st teir 1 legendary, 1st tier 2, first tier 3 to appear from the follow list,
---
  More likely vats hit, ffr, explosive, less ap cost, quad, faster reload speed, weightless; 
---
since less vats cost is only 4th and probably the first tier 3 on the list it basically means I've already considered and agree with your assessment
---
You can change the hud colour on pc by editting the ini files. It would be nice though to be able to do it through settings. This and also menu music slider... that is annoying af!
---
I did have that happen where they jump off the cliff, but not on the last run I did. They were coming from the fenced area. Guess I will just go back to the fairgrounds for scorched. At least there is more there. No more Collision course for me.
---
From what I could tell, it was mostly just milling about in camps. There wasn't a nuke zone going on at the time, and I was on for awhile and no nukes were launched.
---
100 caps on PC. I need 6 violet flux.. If you are on PC l will buy 10 for a round 1000 caps?
---
150 for violet, 100 for all others.
---
Vats hit chance, ffr, and explosive are all on the second tier. You can have a weapon with any of those and still have less vats cost. If you want I can give you a break down of the most usable effects of each tier so you know what's trash and what's not
---
Both persons need to learn where to drop a nuke, these are both in horrible places......Should be more SouthWest of this area leaving Dropsite V9 open to fight the SBQ.....Looks like the second nuke was just being an asshat!!
---
Do you mean the turrets don't move (rotate back and forth) at all?
---
This reddit's discord is nice. I believe its linked in the about section. You can add me in game (if it will let you), my user is KittyKabobs. I'm only level 60 but I can help if you'd like! I'm melee so no need for ammo (:
---
i love this piss yellow color, i even apply something similar to f4 xd
---
o gosh i completely forgot about how terrible durability was on these things! üòÇ
---
People are going to see it as actual money, however, as it's spendable in game and the only way you get items from the Atom shop.    I don't get how you'd instance individual monsters though, the game doesn't support that.
---
I don‚Äôt think the numbers mean much since there‚Äôs a bunch of max 45 good stuff and also crappy weapons even at 50.
---
I‚Äôm on pa4 and have encountered all of these since last patch
---
Sounds like you have "Awol Armaments"....
---
Honestly though thats strange, mabey try turning off and back on your console or pc may fix it.
---
Remember all the stuff the cooking vendor in NV would sell? Lol
---
I do occasionally shout "GREENSKINS!" when I see Super mutants.
---
On the player market, flux sells for 100 each. Some people try to stiff with Violet and Flourescent. In player vendors I buy up to 200. So if I see a few, I'll pay double for what I pay in bulk
---
Yes, I've tamed around 15 creatures;  a message always pops up saying "It will replace any current animal you have tamed." I've never heard of anyone who had two tamed at once, but it certainly could have been a bug, miscommunication, or false memory.
---
If you were asking about walking up to them instead of aiming down sights, I'm not sure if it was intended or not, but it's definitely a thing.
---
Ever seen this then?  [https://www.modiphius.net/collections/fallout-wasteland-warfare](https://www.modiphius.net/collections/fallout-wasteland-warfare)
---
That would be epic!
---
Yea i was like ‚Äòno way i can afford to use this thing, better sell it for 20 caps quick‚Äô üòÇ
---
You're on Reddit and expect originality,
---
if only we knew :D
---
Why do you think Wastelanders is prequel? 
---
It seems if anything - they are all still very much so dead.
---
We will have New Tom and hopefully a Garry or two.
---
ooh ok, I would like to know, I've googled it myself before but it was a little while back and I forgot by now how it went, if thats the case, my ideal sidearm would include vats hit chance, less vats cost, and whichever is the 1st 1st tier from that list, (would you please let me know what that is) now I have a better idea what weapon to look for thx
---
We need ammo scrapper also.
---
Thx for posting something constructive, literally couldn't find anything about this anywhere else on the web, its The only reason I even made this post
---
I'm curious if it was someone botting, someone who sucks or Beth testing lol we may never know.
---
I made a mod disabling the voice for the Liberty Prime PA, so I totally get you, haha
---
Store em and put em back.
---
Or cost a can as an ingredient to make it. Like a deposit on a milk bottle.
---
Yea maybe tomorrow the new meta will be stalker‚Äôs fixer pipe with bashing‚Äô, you just never know üò≠
---
Oh yes it was. Could craft my ammo lol
---
A shelf for storing jars would also be amazing.  Stacked canning jars full of colorful foods are beautiful.
---
example: [https://foodal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Whare-to-Buy-Canning-Jars.jpg](https://foodal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Whare-to-Buy-Canning-Jars.jpg)
---
Then you need more levels. I‚Äôm only using a 1* bloodied .50, a BE .50 would make it even easier.
---
Genius
---
if we come to the point were we rely on stalkers and bash damage i officially quit the game :D
---
All of the above
---
Pc
---
Heard of a 8 dollar fridge. It does the same thing without the can.
---
I am excited for Wastelanders, but at the same time, I also dread its release because I know in typical Fallout fashion it's going to be horrendously janky and full of bugs or other unintentional things that will probably bring down the experience a lot, and it will probably be a media storm where people talk about how much of disaster it is on release.
---
Haha the thing is they can tweak parameters and make something into a new meta, pipe 45 and 308 can also be buffed by both handgun and rifle perks, if they somehow make stalkers a usable feature, you bet a lot of stealth rifleman builds will go for it.
---
"There is nothing better than the smell of few hundreds Atoms spent in the Atomic Shop in the morning."
---
It will cost us Atoms. I'm sure about it. Nice addition to the game. 
---
I have another one. 
---
I find Pip Boy view from my PA much better than the view when I'm outside PA. Let us choose which one we want to use.
---
it does exist.  Got the costume and hat plans both in the same drop.  took me about 45 minutes server hopping.
---
I had the holotape metntioned below on me, BTW.
---
Alos, I didnt find it right at the sign at the spawn point.  See the pickup truck to the left?  
---
Go up that road, pass the first truck with the glowing fungus around it.   A bit past that truck, there is a pair of tucks.  
---
Theres a spawn point between the pair of trucks.  
---
Thats where I found the witch.
---
Those are literally the only places I have seen them.
---
Not really, I've made tens of thousands off other stuff. The damage it would do to merchants pales in comparison to the good it could potentially do. If duping gear is in fact fixed.
---
More of a teal really.
---
**FWIW to specifically address your bug report:**
---
* **Fast Travel Fails**
---
   * Yep same on PC - seems worse on certain servers then others
---
* **Audio Bug**
---
   * haven't had that one - but the curator at prickets fort just found YET ANOTHER BODY
---
* **Random Spawn Point (Hordes)**
---
   * Don't get this when at Horde's but as of late have found that when logging in there is a chance I can wind up somewhere far away from where I logged out.
---
* **Emote Wheel**
---
   * Yes also run into this - often enough - just keep trying it until it works after the 20th time or so
---
Yeah that does happen. Before you spawn if you hear the rad storm sounds, pull up the map and travel to v9 if you master it, you'll get out before you start taking lag. I do it without issue all the time.
---
Do dailies for unique drops! After finishing a few and receiving purified water and radaways for rewards, we gave up. So many missed opportunities! 
---
And grinding quicker for atoms to spend in the shop as well as grabbing items I liked. Didn't realize so many had a time limit and got screwed (totally missed mosaic tile!) when we couldn't play for long stretches of time. 
---
Last, paying better attention to legendary drops and perk cards. We started over and played the game better with our alt characters, but I cringe at weapons I probably sold early on because I needed to free up stash space and/or because they didn't seem as good as they were because I didn't have perks set right.
---
Sorry... he might have a 3-star legendary inside him!
---
well i always assumed that stalkers would make the range of melee weapons greater (like the blitz perk from FO4) dont know why i even thought thats the case but it would be a crazy good effect in that case
---
also for ranged weapons it could have the effect of seeing through stealthboys/chameleon
---
So you'd have to use legendary weapons to repair legendary weapons?  F that.
---
That selling weapons part I think was the toughest lesson heh.
---
Short answer: sell mutation serums to robot vendors.
---
Longer answer: I don't really spend caps except on big ticket items like serum recipes or PA mod plans. At this point even to continue dumping caps into those I'd just be buying duplicates for other characters. I play pretty casual. I don't have farming routes, I rarely run out of supplies. I just go out and play. I'm always doing something but I'm rarely farming for a specific thing. When an event pops up that I like, I go do it. I don't pass up a single SBQ event because that's free flux. Free flux means max serum profit. 
---
If I don't have to fast travel to get somewhere, I save the caps and walk. If I do fast travel I make sure I have Travel Agent in. I try to be as thrifty as possible. 
---
I loot and scrap everything I see. Every couple days I have to do a junk purge on at least one character. That's always good for 1400 caps if not more.
---
I'll save you 2:48. He takes a nap at every camp.
---
Mad lads were playing beer pong with golf balls
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
This has all of the legendary effects in each tier.
---
For what you're wanting, I'm not sure if you're considered in combat since you specified pvp but a Stalker's weapon would ensure a 100% hit on that grenade I think. Then vats hits and less vats would be good for *just* that weapon. Tbh still wouldn't get stalker's. Would opt for a Two Shot because the other bullet might hit it if you miss
---
As fun as building your own place is I never fully enjoyed it.  To me any player home never really looks like a natural part of the world and seems 'artificial' in a sense. 
---
I would gladly like a more lived place that fits in the world and would be ok if it's instanced.
---
I'd love to hear how accurately they portrayed it. What's your opinion?
---
Pleaaaase Bethesda. We beg. We beg of you, of it. We beg of Quercus. Whoever we have to beg, we'll beg
---
&gt; Why do you think Wastelanders is prequel? 
---
I'll try that route tomorrow
---
Very true, note to self: start saving stalkers nowüòÇ
---
In far harbor. Oh you mean in 76? In the mire
---
I don‚Äôt care about the duped stuff I care about the months of trading and buying and grinding for good gear to sell to have it all become worthless. Merchant life is an absolute grind. Don‚Äôt need to make it even more of a burden.
---
I hope they roll them out slowly over time. It would be neat to have Fallout evolve over a few months rather than instantly.
---
Are they stable?
---
well i hope your stashbox can handle it :D
---
I am not trying to be negative here, judt realistic about what kind of impact any choices made by individuals ate going to have in a multiplayer game.
---
There are hundreds of mmos that have dealt with this prior, we don't know specifics but we know the problems that will be faced
---
i think its just a skin right?
---
My experience has been the opposite. To put it into context I have achieved the kill 76 wanted players challenge on more than one character. 
---
Not counting survival, where every single bounty is 100% a trap...off the top of my head I can only think of 2 times it has been a group trap, 3 times it has been a single player well spec'd for pvp that was ready to fight back (which is the most fun IMO), and 1 time it was just a high level guy hanging out in the Whitespring Bunker hoping somebody would aggro all the robots and turrets, which I did because I'm a complete moron and used an explosive handmade on him.
---
Any weapon that uses either commando or rifleman, depending on the receiver, -25% AP legendary mod, any automatic receiver (-50%AP) and craftable mods for another -25% AP cost for a total of 0 per shot. Use nukacrypt to find mods that suit your weapon best, I go with dot sight, forceful stock, swift magazine and rest stuff aligned.
---
That... is actually a really good idea. I would start cooking food for people if I knew it wouldn't be going bad. Give me something to do besides selling what i don't want to a vendor. Not sure how I feel about not expiring right off the bat though. Maybe start off with using salt or stuff for preservation but then have a quest of how to do proper food preservation through mama dolces or something like that to get the full blown effects.
---
If I had to describe my build, id say I'm a vats sneak explosive rifleman build, without a very big empahsis on using vats with my rifles; i know an auto handmade would work well for shooting grenades but I dont want to invest that much weight into an automatic rifle just for shooting grenades, which is the only reason I would carry an automatic weapon as a rifleman build, I've done commando before and honestly I want a very pure explosive rifleman build which means no auto rifles; I'm a fan of ap regen gear myself too, and towards the end of my build I plan to carry, 6-8 explosive dragons, 1 explosive handmade, 1 melee, 1 auto grenade launcher, 1 missile launcher, 1 lightweight sidearm for shooting grenades + TONS OF explosives. I've really gone all into explosive damage, and have already found some two shot explosives, I have no plans to carry a lever action, considering the number of dragon rifles I'll have on me, and my 1 handmade is a TS explosive that I plan on leaving non-auto for the 9 rifleman perks i have. the idea is to fill the first 6-8 slots of my hotwheel with the dragons so that I can quickly swap from one to the next without having to reload, since as you mentioned the dragon is sooo slow to reload, all the while the dragons being buffed from the 9 ranks of rifleman + the explosive legendary effect which procs on each of the 4 individual balls that it shoots and increases damage from the 5 points i have into explosive, I imagine I'll have enough firepower to kill most things before I have to reload once, otherwise I have tons of explosives to finish the job,
---
Try the road from the Sons of Dane Compound/Ammo Dump to Hopewell Cave. I regularly encountered a Fog Crawler there. Should be quite a bit south of Fissure Site Sigma.
---
Yeah the other day it popped so I jumped over. Most of the time if I jump in people see my lvl300+ and it might entice them to join but no one showed..waited out the whole init timer...so I just let it not fire. After that that guided meditation fired and I was the only one there the whole event. Some servers be like that I guess.
---
There are much better luck perks though - Crit Savvy, Better Criticals, Bloody Mess...
---
I just leveled up a couple of mules, and bought a bunch of weapon weight reduction magic armors for them. It‚Äôs kind of incredible really, each one is carrying approx 2k weight of weapons yet can still run and jump üòÇ
---
Their corpses are not guaranteed to have the plans. I'm not sure how their loot is tiered, but it seems more often than not they will not have the plans. It's been this way for a long time. It is possible to get the plans from the corpse more than once though I believe.
---
Not sure why people sell flux so cheaply. I spent 3,000 caps on flux and crafted 10,000 caps worth of serums with it. With average charisma you get 400-500 caps per serum at npc vendors.
---
So technically - they were all dead by the time you stepped out of Vault 76 and got your first glimpse of sunlight.
---
I don't think Wastelanders *(which from what I understand takes place AFTER we leave the vault)* would resurrect anyone or otherwise 'bring them back' from being dead.
---
Thats what I meant by prequel
---
Don't think I've seen them anywhere as a guaranteed or regular spawn. I see them in the mire from time to time and during SBQ fights.
---
I would run that build. pretty much already do fwiw
---
Was just going to suggest the same thing. I think it's great when people post their IRL WV pics for comparison :)
---
I smile when I see it at 100-150 which I guess is what I think is fair. Anything less and I jump for joy. I will pay up to 200 but that is my limit.
---
they did pretty well actually.  especially with the middle gone.  but i don't think there is a train track behind the rock lmao.
---
I've done the same for almost a year. I'd still rather plant new trees than to get rich off cutting the whole forest down. I know your pain like I said, for months all I did was buy and trade.
---
Are your missile turrets connected to a power source and do you have enough power for them to run along with anything else that needs power?
---
Kind of like when I accidentally sold my hunters long coat for 8 caps.... Doh....The person who bought it just could stop thanking me, and I was just standing there in shock because I was completely speechless that I had even put it up for sale, let alone for 8 caps! I just smiled and told them to wear it in good health....
---
Sorry people don't believe you, hopefully someone else can confirm because I'm 100% sure people have brought this up before. I tried to find the thread for you, but had no luck either...

Yes, fusion generator.  Turrets not damaged and water purifiers are working.

But it doesn‚Äôt kill her, or the other creatures.

even through power armor which is a joke!

Lol thanks. I think the thing is that, someone already goes there where i went and took it lol, i just realized I'm probably better off buying from the vendor bot @ flat woods I bought 6 lol I'm just trying to make nuke GRENADES

Exactly! These attention seeking youngsters think this is something worthy of bragging about but it isn't!

I suppose so. Another pressing issue is actual gameplay. Every time I return to the game, I become bored after a week of playing. The content just isn‚Äôt very hooking.

right? it was even designed for it smh

As I said , I did that and no change.  Even scrapped and rebuilt, no change.

What do you mean? It wouldn't effect it that badly.

3- If it were possible we would have the few happy idiots that love to mess everyone else's fun drop from said gliders right on to you or on your camp and destroy everything
---
Yeah it runs rough on my rig - other games like Destiny 2 get a solid 60fps. 
---
My biggest complaint tbh is that overwashed ambient light - the one that makes night day and Day SUPER DAY. 
---
it 100% ruins the art teams efforts at building a terroir.
---
Imagine the first time someone dive bombs a workshop for pvp. Reddit would melt with rage lol.
---
Its been like that since day 1. You need to respawn and not stay dead and talk trash in area while not alive. Just respawn. Or just be in passive... You remain as aggressive\red if you don't select an option to respawn as.
---
Wwf works
---
Just wait for it to come out in the atomic shop
---
No way I would start from scratch. I have 500k+ worth of weapons and armor I use as back stash. That‚Äôs too big of a hit for me to take.
---
I imagine they mean "within"
---
1.When i said glider i meant like one that would be strapped to you armor. Kind of like the jetpack. Which means no vehicles. 
---
2.If they don't fix performance issues by wastelanders then there is no point in making wastelanders
---
3.They can't destroy your camp if your not in combat.
---
Pole hook with multi hook mod is the best two handed melee weapon. 111 base damage compared to 89 (+10 energy damage) for a super sledge with heating coil.
---
Yeah i could join everytime but if i don't see at least 2 people to cover the 3 areas, i don't even bother.
---
Duping hasn't been fixed
---
Nearly every time your server crashes it's because some ebay duper crashed it to dupe.
---
I hear this point, because in the older games you could repair signature weapons with other signature weapons of the same caliber. No definitely wouldn‚Äôt want that, I mean I would say set it up to where you can repair legendary weapons and base weapons only with the base or common version of that weapon to where if you found them you could use a perk to repair your weapon instantaneously to better its condition more instead of a repair kit wasted
---
*three years later*
---
Coming soon to the ATOM shop, canning stations! Only 3200 for a one time use bench!
---
It's a farmer most likely. I found 4 guys with similar names at a train station. 2 stayed there while the other two ported in and out. I keep asking what was going on, then joking said give me caps or I'm posting the video. He told me buy caps on ebay lol.
---
Tomorrow at the usual update time.. so 4 pm GMT, I assume
---
thank you!
---
Cool beans
---
Very true, I'm sure this is also why Vault 96 was quietly removed from the initial Nuclear Winter road map.
---
poor me never realized that the armor effects could stack, I took it for granted that they wouldn‚Äôt. Actually some still won‚Äôt stack for me, such as junk weight reduction,  I‚Äôm still trying to figure stuff out
---
Hmm so a couple thoughts, though I'm a rifleman player, I'd prefer not to invest into an additional rifle just for shooting grenades considering the weight requirements and the belief i have that pistols cost less base ap than rifles, so i'd probably veer away from a rifle for this purpose and go with a pistol instead, i agree with the egendary mod, i agree with the auto receiver, and I agree that I need to research which mods reduce overall ap cost for the gun, I think things like scopes greatly increase ap cost compared to a dot sight like you suggest, though for the sidearm i plan on using i'd probably mod it with no sight since i'll be using it strictly for vats, but besides that I dont think any combination of auto receiver + legendary + mods will get it down to a "total of 0 per shot" i forget how fallout does its stupid crazy math and whether i use the terms multiplicative vs additive right, but I believe ap reductions are multiplicative and not additive; -25% ap legendary mod + -50% ap reciever =/= -75% but rather -50% of the remaining 75% after accounting for -25% ap legendary mod, but I get what u mean I need to research ap mod reductions after I decide on a specific pistol which is what I'm trying to do rn :)
---
It would add in a whole new mechanic in pvp. Tracking missiles will be usefull again, people will have to change the meta to account for flying people. And it's not like they would stay up there forever. It would slowly go down.
---
So, you want a PA/Backpack mod that works like the Bird Bones mutation?
---
I could support that.
---
If they come up again, say 'screw it' and throw 10 cents in a jar.
---
Kind of. Think about a jetpack but on normal armor. And you would slowly go down. Plus no ap drain from using it. Or at the very least slower ap drain.
---
Yes yes. See my edit please.
---
Does if you aim to sell them otherwise it is decoration and a good way to show off skins and you are just wasting budget cause no one will really care what they are.. I mean that is kinda neat to display with a for sale in neon, but if you are just trying to brag seems pointless.
---
The last two times Uranium Fever has popped up, no one has joined me for them. Not that I'm complaining, I'll do a guaranteed 3 legendary drop event any time I can. But I found it incredibly odd that not a single other player showed up.
---
Hello OP, I am the fine purveyor of Stalker's/limb damage/reduced weight Rolling Pins and I am much looking forward to doing business with you tomorrow.
---
Do not forget, 4PM GMT, I will be waiting :P
---
This is brilliant! I have had a ton of cooked food in my inventory at times. Always try and keep some Radstag for the boost in carry weight or get attacked by a pack of wild dogs, or defend a workshop against a horde of Molerats,and wind up with a ton of good food. Only to see it deteriorating and unusable before i eat even half of it. Be good to preserve some of it, especially the stag, so i can explore more widely and not run out.
---
I understand and respect your opinion, this is just mine.
---
because...fallout mentality
---
I get this on my primary char that was created on 0 day.
---
I've only tried it on shrooms. But it worked fine then so I don't see why not...
---
Exactly lmbo, tracking troll missiles on helpless hoarders.
---
So...you'll be wearing a collar with a leash for us?
---
[https://imgur.com/a/vkvo1qB](https://imgur.com/a/vkvo1qB) still a game breaking bug that prevents players from completing the game nearly a year after they claimed it was fixed, and haven't acknowledged its existence since.
---
Hah, that's in-your-face misfortune.
---
Same for you. I just have a grand plan for all my god roll stuff when wastelanders comes out. If we get level 60 stuff I am tanked and my plan goes down in flames.
---
That audio bug seems tied to where you spawn in and/or where you are camped. They should just make the quest that you have to visit and talk to the mayor to get the quest like all the other dailies.
---
this is grrrrrafton's mayor, begging you to not shoot me in the face!
---
When you go to make it , click on the level 20 area , it should have a drop down list where you select level 50
---
Duping weapons is dead or dying. Look at the current meta quad ffr tesla. You cant find that on ebay or elsewhere, at least not when I searched a minute ago to see. All I saw on there was old stuff. They're duping mines and meat cleavers now days.
---
One of my favorite farming weapon, a level 40 TSE gatling, actually came from Uranium Fever. So no UF is not only for scrips üëå
---
You lost me at human pets
---
Right? Any club that would allow me to join would have standards far too low which makes disappointing them even worse.
---
Botulism man.
---
I meant tracking missiles on the hanglider. Because it wouldnt make sense to be able to hold a heavy weapon like that on a hanglider. Plus if you're in combat then you should be able to watch out for attacks from the sky because of how many scorchbeasts there are.
---
gigantic dril
---
If you tab out during a loading screen don't tab back in until the game has finished loading you in. That has stopped the resolution bug happening for me.
---
Another alternative would be the introduction of many new weapons, which might happen with wastelanders. I read that they were gonna do that.
---
They don't even have text chat for deaf people, so I doubt they care about colorblind folks.
---
I will always upvote this idea when I see it. How quickly food spoils that takes very specific and rare ingredients is a drag after putting so much effort into getting it. I would legit get a fridge if they made this a thing, so that I could store meals while I go hunt down cans or bottles.
---
White Wolf Fedora and the Tuxedo hat work, I always choose white wolf one with my grognak costume :P I think the entire Inspector costume counts as unstoppables and formal hat, it's what my friend always wore when we'd do challenges
---
Absolutely. Even if it's like 30% efficient, it's already great. That would remove 200 weight from my stash.
---
Don't really need any money but if you hav any florescent flux I will swap with you..am on pc now come n by mine and I will bye yours
---
Seriously yes, take some raw meat/vegetables and salt and some aluminum (for the can) and it would be amazing
---
That is so amazing.
---
If we had some sort of almost limitless cap sink it would really help the game, top tier legendaries might actually sell for caps not trade only.
---
Yeah that's what I said. Doesn't matter where the missiles are coming from. Only that they're coming. Someone is gonna get blasted while counting plastic scraps and poop a brick.
---
Just about every location is overrun by super mutants, scorched, robots, ghouls or bugs. I'm hoping when Wastelanders comes out that a select few of these settlements are home to Raiders or Settlers. Depending on which side your on, you could actually walk to one of these locations and not get shot at immediately.
---
And a jerking station (masturbatory jokes aside) for meat. Dried and jerked meat lasts a lot longer.
---
Thats weird, I always choose white wolf fedora and grognak costume and it works...
---
But they're not gonna be doing that if they're attacking or defending a workshop.
---
Is there a reason this doesn‚Äôt affect everyone? I‚Äôve completed main quest with two characters with zero issues.
---
Ooh wow ok so after checking that out,  based on my previous assumptions I wouldve said that my best bet was quad + vats hit chance + less vats cost, but I completely forgot about stalkers so if it "worked" i would almost definitely prefer a stalkers + vats hit chance + less vats cost over a quad. so for first tier i would probably consider in this order stalkers (if works), quad, double and suppressors to be the most ideal effect. Though a Two Shot explosive weapon would be a best of slot legendary effect on any other weapon for my character, I probably would not want two shot on my grenade shooting sidearm, I've read many posts suggesting that two shot actually actually lowers overall vats accuracy rather significantly so i think a two shot would actually more me miss the grenade more than it would help me hit it, though im not positive, im pretty sure TS = less accuracy
---
This is so impressive; both the video and the build. Wish I could see it for myself!
---
Todd bless you. üòú
---
just last night I was at my camp and the alarm for a bomb went off I fast traveled down and joined in on the queen, after I was doing the walk of shame back out of my power armour   cause  I used all my fusion cores  and didn't realize it.  when i  noticed that  nearby was an undiscovered location near some pink trees, which weird I thought I had gotten everything in the cranberry hell hole. turns out it was on old shanty town filled with radrats and I found a holo tape ...why are they so sad...his partner was really sick with rads and they had been traveling trying to hide from raiders I think  and they had no meds so he finally finds a safe place goes off to  get supplies finds what he needs comes back and he friends body was being eaten by radrats I am guessing. I think the only holo tape I have found that was a diary that had a good ending was the missing kid at the waterpark
---
No doubt, just meant when it is magically unloaded you don't lose the ammo.
---
Don't you have tons of repair kits? Use those
---
I just deleted the game and stopped playing Bethesda games
---
It's obviously rare, as I haven't seen anyone talking about it, although I stopped playing for a while after being unable to experience half the games content due to this.
---
I have more than I could ever use, no need to create them.
---
Only thing that I can think of is one of two possibilities: There's a power line not connected somewhere or one of your power line connections got borked and bugged out. Check and make sure all lines are correctly connected. If they are and it's still not working, try scrapping then reconnecting the power lines to the turrets, also check the pointy conduits themselves.
---
In one of my previous camp builds I noticed my missile turrets not rotating or doing anything even though they were connected, it turned out to be a bugged wire. Scrapping and re-wiring corrected this.
---
Other than that, I got nothing.
---
You're right it does, but I don't think it's vats accuracy numbers, if it does it's from the recoil. But yeah that seems like a good roll
---
Or one that doesnt take up so much inventory
---
Umm... caps are already worth something.
---
Can you elaborate on what steps need to take place to arrive at what you have provided via screenshot? In the last two months I have done the main quest line 3 times and my wife has done it 2 times (most recent for both of us being last week), we have not encountered this particular problem.
---
I am not trying to deny what you are saying.
---
Beth we need a dark blue phone booth!!! Love the giant K9
---
Hostile mob (or player if applicable) on your radar. (and actively looking for you/aggroed if you're in caution/danger status)
---
ITs on your compass on the bottom of the screen right?
---
No it‚Äôs drawn on a rock
---
I can‚Äôt upload a pic it won‚Äôt let me
---
From what I have experienced and have read from others, including the "Where to farm all the things" document, it's a character based counter for world spawn items (180) and container loot (60 items) for it to be lootable again on your character. Vendor caps and script are 20 hour reset time from your first sell/scrap respectively, though.
---
Confirmed limb specific, still ton of help with SBQ . Running rank 1 with combat rifle non-automatic.
---
Nothing. I would still have waited until Black Friday to purchase the game because I knew it was a wreck during its BETA/launch period.
---
BETA was the best thing the game could have done for any savvy person out there.
---
Ok I get you now! Thanks
---
Fuck that explains why I can't loot logs and plants for days, I don't pick shit up
---
That‚Äôs my plan. Wait to see what comes out and how it stacks up. If it‚Äôs like the fixer than I should have no problems acquiring the new stuff.
---
It was very well documented when the game first released, affecting around 1/10 players. You would simply craft all the upgraded motors and if your game crashed or you lost connection, upon relogging it would say 0/5 motors crafted, preventing you from clicking anything in the computer and keeping you stuck in the menu. The devs have certainly fixed it from happening again, but there are still characters, such as mine, where it had occured and it hasn't been fixed for.
---
I still can't get a backpack the clean the lake daily bot won't give me the quest.
---
Please!!!!!!!
---
Have you submitted a ticket?
---
There was the recent "kill different types of Scorched enemies" one that was glitched, too.
---
Upload it to imgur or any other image hosting site, then post link to the picture here.
---
&gt; If it's not popping it might be the event that's not giving you challenge credit.
---
Thanks, I'll check on that.
---
So I am in a group of players who's caps are pretty close to eachother. One thing I notice is that horizontal distance counts as the boundaries are a sphere. I was able to get my camp pretty close to my buddy (he helps me with builds) By putting it on a cliff. It's really amazing not having to fast travel between camps and helps with continuity if you are into RP.
---
We need this to go viral so it happens, such a great idea.
---
I haven't had this problem since I switched into Borderless Window mode.  Which doesn't mean they shouldn't fix it, but I hope you may find that information of use.
---
5mm runs into the same problem, and Miniguns/Gatlings are about as popular as 50s
---
Good. Now go make something awesome.
---
I've seen them at the houses near welch station, dolly sods workshop, and Braxton's medical supplies but I don't know of any reliable spawns
---
God I hope not, I had a two star I scrapped for scrip last week. And I already know the ‚Äúextra hooks‚Äù mod
---
Nuking golf course doesnt have a decent payout like it used to.
---
Most people run the WestTek/Robco/NAR/Harpers circuit now for legendaries, and uranium fever still draws a crowd.
---
Raider For Life! &lt;3
---
Those worked for me, but the weekly silo codes arent working.
---
Take the sheet with a small grain of saltZ. The leather coats can be found on the responder bot so they aren‚Äôt event only.  Unless one counts the encounter as an event....   hmmmm
---
Damn, guessing it was nerfed? Thanks
---
Somebody once told me I had a few loose screws, I am still looking for those screws
---
Best place is to get a good team, launch queen, and keep her alive till like 5min till event over. She‚Äôll spawn legendary enemies and you‚Äôll get 1 from her and 1 from event. If it‚Äôs garbage you can script it and try your luck with purveyor. 50% sale starts tomorrow
---
220 represents time, that‚Äôs all.
---
I‚Äôm not sure my gear is a full set of ‚Äúreally good‚Äù legendary items. Pretty solid, yes - but it isn‚Äôt like troubleshooter is hard to find. I suspect a high ROF vampire and 5 troubleshooters is plenty. 
---
But yeah, I am attempting to solo something relatively hard and yeah I‚Äôve given it some thought and preparation - but it isn‚Äôt beyond the reach of other more moderate players.
---
Blue screens is on you, dawg.
---
I recommend BlueScreenView if a memory dump was created. Might be able to identify a faulty driver.
---
Not use any weight reduction perks. Now I'm struggling to optimize my build by getting rid of all the food, chems, ammo weighing me down and slowly transferring point after point to different special stats. Its a pain.
---
Nay, its just people dont nuke the golfcourse anymore.  Now if a nuke is dropping its usually the queen.  Which is a decent source of legendaries as well as plans, flux and repair kits.
---
I don't think there's a location that spawns them 100% of the time, outside of Prime Cuts in the Cranberry Bog when that's available.
---
Places I've seen them:
---
* NAR Repair Yard
---
* The highway in front of the Pumpkin House
---
* The viewpoint/rest stop to the west of Ripper Alley
---
* Dolly Sods
---
* Near the Top of the World (once, I have to believe this is a rare sighting)
---
I have the same issue on PS4. And it‚Äôs only FO76 that does it. No other game has this problem.
---
It has been 35 days. Is there any word on when the patch for this will be released?
---
I run a five piece FDC armor build and it's amazing. Water is 0.05 weight, and food and chems 0.03.
---
Nope but it‚Äôs more likely than someone like me who has no concept of the meta does.
---
Frankly I‚Äôm not a great player. I just grounded for and crafted an entire set of ultra cite power armour since I couldn‚Äôt find my set without realising I was wearing it.
---
The reason I won‚Äôt use NV scopes. Can‚Äôt see a dang thing.
---
Which platform are you on?
---
Not true, I have the holotape on me and still loot plans off the witch and skeleton.
---
What platform?
---
This post was downvoted by several 20-somethings that live with their parents.
---
With Speed Demon, I have to stop when running between places, because I can move faster than the game can render on XB1. I love the idea though. I really like the gliders in Far Cry!
---
The car you're looking for is located south-east of Lewisburg. It is rusted, has no doors and has a travel pack in it.
---
Why not both?
---
no this game is unstable as crap, i dont get blue screens but disconnects, freezing, CTD are a norm some days the game is awesome some days its takes a shit every 30 min to an hour have to end task and relaunch. Tired of all the you know what we need or can we have this or that they need to stop adding content and fix the fundamental game breaking issues that have existed since day one. No reason my game should crash from going through my inventory or why trying to join a friend is impossible as its says he is in main menu and they are actually in world. They need to fix all the events and power armor bugs that lag or disconnect players they just need to freeze adding stuff and fix the issues that have existed from day one.
---
I believe that is the coverted munitions factory.  There are some holos about it making tvs and such prewar.
---
Tomorrow
---
I'd love this. Especially if there was maybe a possibility that the canning could go wrong and you ran the risk of botulism (blurred vision and weakness as symptoms would translate easily into fallout).
---
Yes.....
---
Have you? Really?
---
Could integrate it right into the tinkers workbench maybe.
---
South Boston?(Fallout 4)
---
I don't remember one in 76, and couldn't find it on google or wiki.
---
Exactly, dont need perks when there's these kinds of legendary effects.
---
Yea no, I just did a search for PC and found multiple listing's for that weapon in less than 5 secs
---
The markets aren't full of them because they aren't being traded for other items or caps, it's $
---
That was Radiation King then United Stated Armed Forces
---
Yes. I have done this. The marker was still on my map even after they logged off. I was stuck with it.
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs pretty hard to decide what to scrip because the 2nd effect is good.. I have a bunch of those such as Troubleshooter rifles with explosive bullets, zealots Tesla with 25% faster fire rate, etc. Too good to scrip but too slow to sell, sigh
---
weird, i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs there because there‚Äôs a challenge to take a picture at the converted munitions factory, then right under that it says to take a picture at the general atomics plant, i‚Äôm lost
---
It's funny because I stumbled upon this holotape in the last hour!
---
For some players, maybe, but unless they have anything better than ‚ÄòMeat Week #3‚Äô to fill the gap then the game will be in trouble.
---
me neither! i‚Äôm clueless
---
Usually they are 100 a peice. 
---
I have seen them as low as 25 (guy didnt know what he had I think).
---
I would say 80-125 is the most normal range
---
Some people put them up for as much as 150, but thats a bit high IMO.
---
whitespring
---
If you're looking for the decisions that you make to effect OTHER PLAYERS, then yeah that's probably not going to happen.  But I'd wager that, individually, we'll see the decisions we make in Wastelanders have an effect on us as we walk throughout the wasteland.
---
The only plausible way I can see individuals having an effect on other players, is maybe there could be a ranking system for which faction has the most missions done, or which one has the most support.  Then whoever scores the highest after so long will get some kind of positive buff, or take control of some central goal that all factions fight for.
---
Oh wow, you built it just like Hollywood sets are built. Just enough to sell the illusion from one angle, but nothing on opposite side. I was wondering how you got around the build limit. The lack of turrets probably helped too!
---
Flamer and long bow bar
---
its the same SPECIAL stat for both, so build both.
---
Try them both out, find out which you like better.
---
What are you taking about? It's fast, chance at fixer plans (10k right now maybe more with sale) high lvl bots with other legendary mixed in.
---
Encrypted is a great event.
---
I originally thought it was a symbol of the Scorched Plague, kind of a warning for a contaminated area. But apparently it's a normal Raider communication sign. You can find it in many places all over the region, like on Summersville Dam or the Freak Show.
---
To be honest, I'd rather have Scrapper give you a chance for screws/springs/etc. to make scrapping similar items effectively working.
---
Don't follow the quests. Take the time to level up. You're massively unprepared for the Savage Divide.
---
I'd have not missed the Blackbird skins *every time they were available.* Big RIP.
---
Id buy that for 500 atoms
---
fallout 5
---
The dreams of men cannot be denied!!!
---
Sorry - 9am Sydney Australia time so am at work for a while. Used up all my fluorescent flux making serums unfortunately...
---
I literally never get the option to send anything to my camp and I domt
---
don't know why :(
---
200?
---
Just tried and yes  listing on both...
---
Just try "fallout 76 pc quad" ," fallout 76 xbox quad," "fallout 76 ps4 quad"
---
Creamed corn, yay!!!!
---
Good luck!
---
Like I said, I've played the other Fallouts so I am aware there are automatic rifle and semi-automatic rifle perks. I have 5 perks that increase semi-auto rifle damage but it feels like none of them even do anything.
---
Taming only works for event spawned creatures. They also have to spawn alone and not in a group. I'm on my phone or I'd go find the link but check youtube for taming guides.
---
Ah ok, Im 2 hours behind you and dont get on til 9pm or so...
---
And speed demon?
---
i‚Äôll probably be up all night, if you have one what is your discord?
---
What system?
---
Go to main menu, settings and check "chat" volume. Mine gets put to 0 alot when i log on. Ps4 btw.
---
Woah crap yeah I typed it in verbatim and sure enough 100 bucks lol. Even so it's no where near as rampant as it once was, which is why I said dead or dying. On another topic, who in the world is paying 100 dollars for a gun in a game!?!?!?!?
---
they used to give them out free when you joined the enclave. I don't see the point. they have minus 2 perception. my flight helmet protects from disease and has no minus.
---
PS4
---
Are you on ps4?
---
Most importantly, please don't make this into an atom shop like the refrigerator, you know... the idea we have told you a long time ago.
---
Ngl this sounds kinda dope
---
PC :)
---
Where are you trying to get it to spawn? It is no longer in the mining locker. You need to go trough scavenger hunt to find if.
---
pc my man :)
---
Fallout: We promise we tested it this time
---
yeah, I was waiting for a sale.... stupid move. Also not holding on to my explosive flamer or quad explained assaultrons head. that would of just been fun to have now
---
 Either go overseas and give us fallout red for China or Russia..... or stay homme and give us fallout lone star set in Texas... start in Austin or DFW and have expansions for Houston and whichever of Austin or DFW you didn't start in.
---
lol, coming soon to an atom store near you.  After all it's just a convenience that your food never spoils and there's no advantage to be gained by food that grants hundreds of ap refresh, healing and stat bonuses but never spoils!
---
Thanks everyone for their input. It's greatly appreciated!
---
I would try this build out if you want to do both;
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f333cc8&amp;d=s41sm1sn1sq1s31sr1s01s20p02eo2cr0c70i44ic4s11s72au2aj2a72l71lu2ls2&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
This map is useful for seeing level locations.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/WssJoMc
---
Please consider the balance impact before you do this.  A lot of "cool ideas" have made the this game unnecessarily imbalanced and this one would grant people access to unlimited AP regen along with stat boosts and healing on demand that never spoils and has little drawbacks other than the weight cost to carry it around.
---
that applies to both pvp and pve.
---
Food is crazy powerful in the this game, only balanced by spoilage.  Take that away and the power creep marches on.  I guarantee new strategies will emerge to abuse this the day it drops if it ever goes live.  Strategies no one at Bethesda envisioned when they built the feature.
---
Yep
---
I've got like 3 extra copies of the plan. I'm happy to trade for it if you have any excess ammo.
---
It seems like almost no one talks in "Area" settings. Auto doesn't seem to work at all, least not for me. Everyone either uses Team or is in a PSN party. I would guess the same for whatever PC or Xbox has equivalent to PSN party chat.
---
Came here to say this! Please, share your wisdom with us once more u/RF_huntr what would you call the game after Fallout 5?
---
Fallout: Shattered Coast
---
Give Seattle and Vancouver some love
---
I do, but just thought it would‚Äôve been a cool idea especially for lower levels that start that don‚Äôt have the luxury of killing a Scorchbeast Queen so early. Or just a nice perk to throwback to some of the older games that might prove useful for some
---
SSD?
---
What are you playing on. If you're on Xbox I'll give some to you.
---
I see these all the time, but never any evidence to support enemies dealing significantly more damage than normal.
---
What does that stand for?
---
Fallout Texas
---
I feel this. After nearly a month of running around with my small backpack, and grinding away at the tadpole badges to get the regular. It took me almost another two weeks to discover that once you get a backpack, you can craft a higher level, higher capacity bag at your tinkerers bench...
---
Lmao

I did that with serums. I mean I accidentally consumed them instead of dropping them so my daughter could give them to my mule.
---
Just have the entire state be the map
---
Dubious at best
---
Most people would, and I sure do as well, but sometimes you might like to use that instant repair without having to use a kit that normally is last resort. Just thought it would be a nice perk to mix in to give you the option to do especially depending on your build
---
Aw hell yea I'll be there! 
---
Happy 200th, you're over the hill
---
Two things to keep in mind:
---
-The people who fix bugs are not the same people who make other new content. The voice actors/3d modellers/etc can't just sit on their ass for weeks until the programmers can iron out the major bugs, they work independently of each other, and new item skins don't take away from polish
---
-The 76 community (and greather bugthesda fanbase in general) has made it pretty clear that they're willing to tolerate quite a bit of glitchyness. And if you're okay with the bugs, obviously the next in priority is more content.
---
Solid state hard drive. It‚Äôs way faster than conventional.
---
Do not do both, personally I would say heavy but 2h melee is also good although not as good as one handed
---
Hmm I'd be interested in seeing a 2 minute clip of you running in a straight line near/into a city or something.
---
I'm on PS4, but I appreciate the offer
---
I completed the quest with no issues
---
I'm happy to hear you've been finding the guide helpful! Thanks for helping spread word of the guide, as I'm not able to catch all the posts which keep asking where to farm things myself.
---
What armor are you wearing?
---
My dad bought the ps4 and hasn't edited it. So it's whatever standard has.
---
Is there really any benefit for going either way like what would be the pros for a 2 handed build and pros for a heavy build?
---
I get that everytime i kill a bunch of scorch beasts near watoga, i fast travel to watoga and bam they rain out of sky and land in a big heap beside me
---
I felt the same way too.
---
Then I realized I didnt reequip Serendipity and Dodgy after crafting some ammo.
---
It was my own fault.
---
Check  your perks, you may have forgot to reequip somthing.
---
fallout 6
---
[](/ksunsetpunk)That would be the perfect spooptober gift. double points if they also scale it to max level instead of only level 20.
---
I haven't done my rangers office hat run in about a month, but they were still spawning then fwiw.
---
Two Legendary leather pieces, combat chest armor, the rest is modded leather. But my problem isn't so much that I take too much damage, my damage output just feels way too low for being level 26.
---
It makes a surprising difference in speed.
---
I always enjoy seeing them and it's one of the few times I turn on sound ;)
---
The British Grenadiers March is the tune being played.
---
Add me. This is my psn. I‚Äôm actually going to go through all my characters today or tomorrow and get an actual inventory of what I have. Haven‚Äôt done it in a while. Maybe I‚Äôll find some good surprises.
---
Exactly, thank you!
---
Great, can't wait to see it in the Atom Shop because integrated content is impossible.
---
Well how would you like to present send evidence? I run around in my Combat armor one day and take little to no damage when fighting anything from Super Mutants, to ghouls to SBs, but then suddenly after the previously mentioned patch (I think it was 11not 12 or 13) I suddenly get killed all the time. Then I'm pretty sure after another patch I'm all of a sudden a walking God again.  
---
I mean the game is laughably easy, so for it to suddenly become Hard for no apparent reason. That seems like a reason to ask wtf is going on.
---
I'd wait 2 weeks and buy it for significantly less money and your #3
---
 Biggest fallout map ever made
---
This, lots of this.
---
I miss displaying  my different sets like I did in 4.
---
2 words will fix this all: Private Servers
---
I've had the plan from the first days and have gotten a 2* fixer from mmmrgh.
---
Log into a personal terminal. It should start there
---
Heavy will do more damage than 2h melee but less than 1h melee although you will have to keep up with ammo but it isn't bad at all. The only way you would do more damage with a melee is if you ran bloodied 2h
---
"16 times the detail"
---
They already confirmed having human companions
---
I‚Äôm hooked and can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs next
---
Brilliant!  And, this may be controversial, but may I ask what you plan to name the title after Fallout 6?
---
The game would definitely not be able to handle it
---
I got a very nice fixer from her during the last sale and I got/learned my fixer plan within 4 days of encryptid being in game.
---
Wait, where do I find the sex dungeon plans for my camp? xD
---
Nope I don't run any anti damage perks other than Lone Wanderer
---
I'm still waiting for them to sell the bungalows in WS.
---
Harpers ferry probably
---
If they made the glider right then it could. Especially if it's like the jetpack where it's a mod on your chestpiecs. Just not on PA.
---
I second this.
---
I would have paid better attention to my perk cards early on and bought serum recipes.
---
1.no your wrong it would work like being in admin mode flying around except you would jitter from rendering issues
---
2. you dont know the fundamental issues with the engine, do some research and look how badly it is a frame rates and why its so bad.
---
3. i was basically telling you what dumb asses would do i didnt say you said dive bomb learn to read and comprehend
---
He did the legwork for em and everything
---
I get being proud of your weapon collection, but if I saw that I would prolly assume they are all vanilla and that is what you wish they were. Wish there was an option to inspect displayed weapons.
---
Survival is gone for now
---
Fallout 5: It just works.
---
I learned the plan within the first few days after Encryptid came out and have received multiple Fixers from Mama Mumbles. 
---
Just to confirm, have you learned the plan or are you just holding it?
---
Try and grab me an explosive gatling plasma
---
Already know that‚Äôs going to be in the Atom shop
---
They removed survival.  Not many people played it, so they wanted to send the resources to Wastelanders launch instead of continuing to try to balance a broken game mode.   They nerfed it to obllivion and people stopped playing it when Nuclear Winter came out.
---
Thanks! Learned it and have made many for sale. Just unlucky I guess?
---
1. Not if they made it right. With enought testing and worl it could be done.
---
2. I may not know frame rates but i know you can see the whole map if you get high enough. Then you just jump. If it moves as fast as sprinting then there would be no problem.
---
3. Sorry my autism makes it hard for me to tell the difference between that stuff. But still they would try and fail because pacifist mode.
---
I think fallout 7 has a nice ring to it
---
Did you try it with the crystallising barrel?
---
My experience with instanced areas only extend to lucky hole ores. And those almost always bug out and don't fully mine. 
---
Bethesda has had ZOS work on the game, ya know the people that made Elder Scrolls Online, which uses instanced areas perfectly. Please just let them do it because it is done right
---
What have you turned off though? Every single time someone has come forward talking about how their game runs smooth with no major issues, there's been something MAJOR they've disabled like reflections or shadows.
---
I have a much beefier rig (i7-9700k, RTX 2080ti) and it struggles in places like the edges of the Whitespring golf course (primarily east and south), when showing some 3D models in stash and just other odd places.
---
I have shadow distance WELL below low (3000 vs 20000) which helped a bit. And if I don't care about FOV, I can put it back down to default and that alone gives me an average of 20 FPS boost.
---
I like the idea some other poster came up with: make some item npc's sell that allows us to start the quest when we want.  Like Encryptid.  There's not enough caps sinks in the game so this would be perfect.
---
I am perfectly fine with that!
---
Yes that‚Äôs what I started with. Then I watched a YouTube video and the guy said the standard barrel was better. Which makes no sense at all to me. Is it like a certain amount of damage to freeze enemies?
---
Like everyone look at this, Bethesda come look at this, copy and paste and your golden. This is revolutionary.
---
Wow cool I am so upset
---
I loved that mode more than life ugh, even after Nuclear Winter, Survival was all I played. Damn. Hopefully they bring it back! Is Adventure worth playing again? Is there even PVP there?
---
Are you a heavy gunner?
---
North West South West through the forest of maze
---
If you're on xbox and have cobalt I'd love to buy them from you! I have a very hungry primed plasma flamer at home
---
Fallout: New Houston.
---
I can get 144 FPS (mostly while looking at the ground) and an average of 80ish with a 144hz monitor and 2080ti. Mind you it did take minor fiddling with nvidia control panel, but that's it.
---
It still becomes an awful chug fest in odd places (Whitespring golf course...) but at least it's technically capable of  over 60 FPS.
---
Yup, I do have some cobalt...
---
Scrip should be unlimited, there is no good reason for it not to be. Caps only have value when you don't have many, been using flux as currency for high dollar trades because it doesn't lose value and they are a pain in the ass to make, sitting on 150 or so of each stable flux.
---
It Is Max level. And my unarmed ninja uses a faster swing, 40 power attack +1 strength power fist.
---
Level 26 is pretty low. I feel like leveling up is faster in this game. What level rifle are you using? Combat rifle has lower damage per shot than hunting rifle. If you want to do real damage with combat switch to auto and use commando perk. Hunting rifle is good at thy level though. Remember that you will need leveled up rifles or you will always under perform in the damage department.
---
I totally understand that but it wasn‚Äôt my point. My point was somethings are more important then others. The endless wants of camp stuff on some of the subs are just crazy. If we got all the things that are being ask for is it really FO76 anymore?
---
Workshop PVP still exists, but you cannot initiate PVP anywhere else unless both parties are willing.  
---
The only way to initiate PVP in Adv mode anymore is to do workshops, or trick someone into dropping pacifist(which most consider greifing)
---
Gone are the days where you could wander around killing people aimlessly with slap damage.
---
Also, stuff like electrically charged and tesla coils no longer trigger PVP if you melee someone with one of these effects up while they are in pacifist.  It used to allow PVP, but they changed it.
---
DM'd üëç
---
Yeah, my first badge was cooking and when all those bugs were happening with the other badges I thought for sure this one was fucked up too, but theres just two different versions, silly...
---
Which has also been experimented with in other mmo's forever. It rarely plays out in what I would call an impactful way on the world, but in many different incarnations is fun. 
---
(Like the entire structure of Dark Age of Camelot)
---
Btw I have no firework mines, so I cant light any off, but I'll celebrate with you!
---
Yeah, thank God everyone spawns on the road.
---
Truth!
---
I just spitballing here but, wouldn't the auto mod be better.  ie. higher DPS = more chances to proc.
---
No commando
---
Heavy gunner perks pal
---
I would of thought! Idk tbh. I have no clue why that guy said that.
---
Parasitic mouth worms? No issues here. That's just more tickle for the pickle.
---
I have a heavy gunner/two handed build. While unarmed and two handed do more damage when perked correctly with the proper mutations, heavy guns are more fun (imho). If I had to choose 1, it would be heavy guns. Just be prepared to farm materials for ammo...it becomes trivial with practice. I think the most challenging aspect is getting not just a heavy weapon or two, but the *right* heavy weapons.
---
I would recommend a Furious Gatling Plasma (prime), a furious .50 cal (prime), and a vampire's .50 cal (non-prime) for your walking around weapon, as they are all easy to obtain. TSE/AAE variants would be ideal. Of course, if you don't mind a bloodied build, which is a very viable option, go for that. Regardless, the Furious weapons do a solid job even with the SBQ.
---
rocket 69 rocket 69
---
good luck with that, repair kits cannot be dropped traded or sold :P
---
I want muh ice vault
---
I got a 3 and 2* fixer from mmrrrrph and ive had the plan since forever.  All depends on the server
---
Just unlucky. I actually feared the same thing the first couple times I turned in scrip and didn‚Äôt get one. Then suddenly they started dropping like crazy. Hopefully you have the same luck!
---
I hope they dont make it so npcs can easily die. I don't want all their deaths be on my hands because I couldn't protect them :*( I mean it's only a matter of time over a long period of time
---
There are two marine helmets. Marine helmet and marine tactical helmet. If you definitely mean the second one, it spawns at world spawn points. A good one is the train carriage between Watoga train station and repair yard
---
I ignore them. It's more often than not a trap.
---
Not that I carry any junk I really care about, but I can't feed the trolls.
---
Lol
---
I hope Beth listens. We deserve Chainsaws!!
---
Great.
---
There are two "plan based mods" in the game files but they are not possible to obtain in-game. There are two "scrap to learn" mods.
---
I see these posts all the time but I play daily and have never noticed an increase in enemy damage. I wish they‚Äôd make things tougher.
---
The "preservation" perks are handy tho
---
Great info, thanks!
---
Stop, your critical thinking is going to break your game sphere!
---
I‚Äôd love to display a few that rotate, got some interesting mixes of armor skins to showcase!
---
gratz my man
---
I disagree with only carrying diluted stimpaks, I carry around 4 or 5 regulars to help revive people because you cant use diluted or even supers for that.
---
Why cant they get this right. ESO works fine.
---
Yeah. Wastelanders *needs* to be a knock out. But, ah, I'm not exactly confident chief.
---
Honestly I just want v96 at this point so I have a reason to play the game again lol. I only log on very sporadically ever since I finished my Strangler set around halfway through week1 of Washout.
---
Completely agree. But since it's been requested Idk about 100 times, they won't add it. If they do look in the AS first.
---
I have a discord for "plan collectors" if that interests you
---
I get that for damage but I just freeze the damn thing! Is it crit shits that freeze? Or just random? I have a 2 shot with limb damage just for her
---
It's known as the feral kiss of death
---
Please include pink.
---
I love this idea.
---
Nice. Nice.
---
Wouldn't have started off melee, but unfortunately it was the easiest and most OP route to go down initially.
---
If you find a corpse, get a friend to hold the server and keep server hopping. The plans will appear fairly quickly. If you have already looted the corpse you will have to wait for the "container" (body) to reset
---
How can you get wanted anymore beside lockpicking something someone else "owns"
---
They removed.
---
You just know the space Needle is some secret govt weapon.
---
Ooooooh ok. 
---
Gotcha üëå yeah that will be refreshing I guess.
---
Interesting thanks for the tip I‚Äôll try moving
---
The pipe pistol is a weird one right? I have a friend who is on 65/66 and has the same mods as me. I am on 64/66. We both have scorched killer and neither of us has "plan: pipe gun automatic mod". All other mods seem to be learnt or unlocked.
---
I'm sure she has. Problem is, they don't seem to care what CM's say. Making their job worthless.
---
I run a hybrid heavy gunner/ melee build works very well only have to change perks when you need to switch but its a fantastic setup so long as you have all the right gear/ mutations /perk setups
---
I would have created 5 characters, 1 to play, and 4 to store junk legendary items to scrip at the purveyor
---
You ain't hallucinating. Enemies sometimes do attack hard for some reason. Had a scorched one shot me and he wasn't even wielding anything. I'm bloodied so keep that in mind but even a deathclaw can't pull that kind of damage off. It's even more frustrating cause it seems totally random. Sometimes you get one shot and sometimes you take normal damage.
---
I love to just Yeet out six cannon balls lmao
---
It blew my mind how few new weapons are useful. There are so many un modifiable weapons that could be awesome. I really wanted a serrated sickle to take down scorched with.
---
&gt;3\. Not sure on beneficial effects if they'd be more or less than fresh soups / drinks / meals, nor on rads. Would need balancing.
---
I would say that any buffs applied by the canned equivalent of recipes should be less... maybe half? That and added weight would balance out the lack of spoilage.
---
And/or maybe a (very) small chance for items to go bad based on your Intelligence; the lower your Intelligence, the more likely you are to get the canning process wrong or use poor sanitation in the process, etc.. The higher it is, the better chance you have to do it correctly. Maybe the Intelligence check can factor in to how much of a buff you wind up getting from the end product.
---
12345 for me too buddy
---
I wasnt aware of that. I always inevitably have normal stims on me from events and other stuff, I just don‚Äôt usually leave camp with them. Good to know.
---
Melee weapons are lame because the only 2 stats you look at are swing speed and damage. This means that one weapon will usually always be better than another just by raw stats. At least guns have stuff like ammo type, magazine size ect to add variety.
---
Preach it brother! We need more melee weapon mods for sure! But alas, we can atleast be realistic and hope Bethesda adds the Chainsaw in tomorrow's patch.
---
I like how after 500+ hours I still have plenty of stuff to learn. üëç
---
I'm hoping little Freddie shows up from one of the vaults.
---
I used to grind PP for scrip. Besides the queen, it's the only source of a 100% 3‚òÜ enemy. And it doesn't cost a keycard and a ton of ammo.
---
I still would probably prefer running DitW if that happens to be in season that week, but honestly I'd rate PP above the other two raids and the queen as far as legendary grinding. Back when you could start it whenever, it might even have edged out UF (at least, a statistically average UF)
---
Making it impossible to jumpstart was such an unfortunate side effect of public event cycles.
---
Edit; that I forgot about the Imposter SS really says something about how successful that event ended up being
---
Mold
---
Also the unbearable lag that has affected the whole game since that Vault came out!
---
I'm not excusing it. And I didn't say give them a break. What I said was I hope they iron it out because I like playing the game. Whatever.
---
I totally agree. There are not many events that guarantee a high lv 3 star. This is vital for late game play. Being a lv200 is rough trying to find upgrades to equipment when most events give low lv stuff. Uranium fever is an example of a GREAT event, low lv üò≠.
---
Good call. The fact that they have mirelurk and fox jerky but not brahmin or venison jerky is absurd. Now I really want some venison jerky.
---
It happens on xbox one s set at 1080p, at least for me, i got mine set to 720 and it doesnt happen anymore, honestly a glider would be perfect for this game but i dont think it would work atm.
---
I've gotten burned by UF spawning lower level mobs a few times, but it's not usually a problem thankfully
---
Her remains are still in the Mayor's office at her desk; she shot herself. At least that's the conclusion that I came to from reading the terminal entries and seeing the skeleton slumped in the chair and the 10mm on the floor.
---
I don‚Äôt really mind it until I hear the flare every time i go to someone‚Äôs camp haha
---
Anyone want to sell a plan on PC?  I‚Äôll pay 15k caps.  Never got the drop :(
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong it always gives legendarys they just usually drop max levels unfortunately.
---
When I froze the queen, I had all damage related perks on and it worked. It took two or three clips to do it but it did it. I never used vats on the cryo
---
When you spawn into welch train station to your left is usually fog crawlers or sheepsquatch
---
Easiest way I have found is taking the Workshop up at  Hemlock Holes.  There are three acid veins up there that you could put extractors on.
---
There are other ways such as cave crickets but that involves a lot of server hoping and hoping that they spawn up.  I haven't seen a cave cricket in probably two plus months.  I just take that workstation and farm while I go take care of other things at the same time.
---
Deathclaws also drop acid usually as do  Yao Guai.  Again this depends on them being at known locations and my luck seems that every time I go out looking for a specific resource from a beast, they are never there.
---
Don't sweat it, someone will lower their standards enough to give you a shot some day.
---
 in RL there is a 3 way road in front of the rocks but in the game there isn't so its kinda hard to find where i am.
---
Hi  in rl there is a 3 way road in front of the rocks but in the game there isn't so its kinda hard to find where i am., I'm dad.
---
FO76 isn't exactly bursting at the seams with good content. A lot of the assets are flips from FO4, a lot of the mechanics are fairly shallow, a lot of the quests are basic and grindy, a lot of the locations are empty and uninteresting. That's not me trying to bash the game, I enjoy it a lot and I'd personally rather polish first too, but it's pretty reasonable to want more content, especially when the endgame is just wandering around looking for legendaries. It's just a matter of opinion what people value more
---
And, like I said, asset creation and bug fixing are handled by different people. Working on one doesn't take away manpower from the other, even if Bethesda only focused on bug squashing, a texture artist can't fix programming bugs.
---
I don't think FO76 is in danger of losing it's "creative vision" either. Of course some people make suggestions that don't fit with what the game is, but those people are still entitled to their opinion of what they want the game to be. Bethesda isn't obligated to listen to them, so I don't really see why it matters in the end
---
Ok so maybe that‚Äôs it! You have to hit her a ton of times. I only had like 50 rounds! I‚Äôm going to craft a bunch and see what happens.
---
The only time it has ever been consistent was after patch 11 (I think), everything was harder, it was like playing on FO4 Survival mode, Deathclaws were actually terrifying, Ghouls in the Whitesprings were challenging, Super Mutants could actually fight. But then the next patch fixed it. 
---
I just recently noticed it again, starting last night and continuing through today.
---
Tanagra town. Get good at climbing the mountain and killing the platoon of deadly cave crickets in close quarters. Server hop. About 50 acid per hop. Profit.
---
There are plenty of open-ended "flavor" stories around Appalachia. Many of those notes tell people to meet the other party at some location out of the area and one or both could certainly have made it out. Calvin Lowe's sister, for example, could definitely be alive; her last message to him was that she was leaving (can't remember if it noted a specific location) and that she hoped he was able to get out as well.
---
The guy who left Johnson's Acre could have made it out as well. There are a lot of others that aren't necessarily a sad ending.
---
Weird. I've never experienced it.
---
Looks like one of those robot dogs from isle of dog
---
Doubt it. People abused the shit out of the old system which is why it got patched in the first place. Another easy method was to just stack stash boxes around the outside of the workshop bench so nobody could access it.
---
The new system sucks but there needs to be some way for people to contest workshops. A 5-10 second countdown timer would be an easy solution to prevent you from getting jumped.
---
I built my camp on an acid extractor and I can't use the stuff quick enough. Plus I don't need to mess around with pvp stuff trying to take a workshop.
---
a smoker for the precious meats that give good stat buffs. then maybe i wont laugh at people who have "food builds"
---
Gotcha. Well yea would be cool to meet them.
---
Pretty sure there is also a dual bar mod.  Used the heck out that before chainsaws got nerfed.
---
this post should be on a list of helpful posts
---
I personally would go with the 3 star.  I used to always do two stars, but then I when I started only doing three stars, I started getting better weapons with better effect, but you do you
---
grind ash heap? why? because i never grind that spot
---
I have 1k scrip too, just want a damn tse fixer or some good stuff at least, prayinggg
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm torn. All I need is the handmade. If I could get a 2 star quick, I‚Äôd switch to 3 stars, but I‚Äôm just dreaming.
---
Why does this have such a small number of upvotes? What OP says is ABSOLUTELY crucial and needs devs' attention in order for new dlcs to succeed.
---
What I fear the most here is that thing many of us have seen before more often than necessary during the last year: new content/patches receive such negligible amounts of internal testing (if any) that it seems like the developers don't even try to play their own game even with some major patches to see the glaring issues that uprise right after you start the game with said new content. And no, I'm not trying to bash on Beth here too, I love the game as well and spent 1100 hours playing it since b.e.t.a. (well, maybe half that actually playing and half at the loading screens and fighting bugs) But it felt like their QA department barely exists at all too many times. And it looks like what we do here is beta-test the game most of the time. Some people even find it enjoyable at times, but most of the time the game in its current state feels like it is still very far from a product ready for release. And if this is not alarming considering an upcoming huge content update, then I don't know, what is. Fight me.
---
P.S.: Sorry for my english, it's not my native language.
---
If you get a tse fixer I‚Äôll give you my BE handmade üòÇ
---
Weird. I wore my red dress and the ww fedora and nothing. Switched hats and presto. This game is so weird lol
---
I've got over 200+ canned coffee I've been selling along with the vegetarian ham and all that kind of stuff. Pretty fun.
---
If nothing else, there‚Äôs gonna be a lot of good stuff out in the wild at players vendors. Save them caps.
---
I'll probably do mostly 2\* but also a few 3\* ranged weapons. Depending how things go.
---
This would ideal but if there are technical reasons that keep it from happening, I would like to be able to display my skinned helmets in the display cases.
---
For me it's strictly esthetic
---
I have two bloodied/unyielding builds, one with full Urban Scout armor and the other with full Forest Scout armor. I have the Urban Scout mask and use either the Green hood or the BOS hood with it. Using the Raider/Skull gas mask on the other until I turn up a Forest Scout mask.
---
For PVE the bloodied/unyielding combo is pretty OP, so -2 perception isn't noticed in game play
---
I had nothing but liberators spawn in the club house one time. It was weird.
---
Fallout: New Age
---
Thanks! Accepted invite
---
what if ur hud color determined ur markers on the map also ur teammates health bar etc each person could pick a different color make team planning and managenent easier seperate colors, color by who has what builds, but still only see ur teammates colors that way u dont get mixed up
---
Sure just dm me the link if you want
---
I‚Äôd love it, but kinda scared of the explosive. Hoping for a faster fire rate. 
---
Hey, a guy can dream can‚Äôt he?
---
Oh! That's be why then. Is that a quest?
---
Great! Maybe now I can get those pesky final 6 that I can never seem to find.
---
Fallout 5: JANGLES REVENGE
---
I think the one gun army perk card also stun locks the SBQ with heavy guns
---
Thanks - this will help me get some much needed atoms.
---
The crystallising barrel is broken , that's why
---
Damn, never came across someone who wanted them so I've never tried before. I thought it was only the paid ones you couldn't give.
---
Get a rad backpack. It works just as well. I switch to one all the time during a sbq fight and just maul her face with my bloodied dcg.
---
I don't have a whole lot of scrip saved so I'm thinking 2* ranged for me. Or maybe 3* armor as I already have some decent enough rifles.
---
You're right. And it's not wrong to expect it. But it's new to Bethesda, and it might not be simple. I'll lose karma but I don't care, but I think it may be hanging on a thread. Recouped the initial investment maybe , but not enough profit to spend a lot of time on wastelanders. I think a good wastelanders launch, plus private servers, are what they need, or this whole multiplayer experiment will be done by spring. There's only so many skins they can sell to keep it a profitable enterprise. I say that as a Bethesda fan, and I hope they succeed.
---
Dont forget to change servers if you are getting poopy effects.
---
Should be like ESO's decorator where you can remove clipping entirely in object placement, it even let's you adjust the angle and rotation of items!
---
Thanks will do!

I'm going to go asll 3 stars. At a 50% discount I figure I'm getting more bang for my buck...er scrip
---
Again I understand programming, I write it for a living. I understand some of your points but my game play doesn‚Äôt require what‚Äôs being requested to do improve my game play of joy of the game.
---
This would negate refrigerators and refrigerated backpacks, they would have no point and become decoration. All the people who bought the silly fridge from the atom shop would scream bloody murder. On some level this game has to remain a Survival game, letting people make canned items takes away from the survival aspect of the game greatly and that isn't a good thing to say the least, the game is all ready too casual, keep disparity alive. I'm sadly against this idea.

We use 6TB LTO magnetic tapes at work for critical data backup. And I think those are even a generation older than the newer, sexier LTO tapes. Funny enough, they‚Äôre roughly the size of a holotape. 4TB was probably a lot to 1990‚Äôs videogame lore writers! So at least we have that one-up on the FO universe.
---
(Bonus wall o‚Äô text: magnetic tape is so far the best archival medium known to exist for large volumes of digital data, as well as analog audio recordings. Reel to reel tape has been in use since the 1930‚Äôs. Some audio recordings of the Marx Brothers and Hitler still exist, on their original tapes, and they sound almost as good as today‚Äôs mp3‚Äôs. Hitler‚Äôs recorded speeches are credited with aiding in the Nazi‚Äôs rise to power. The technology was so good for the time, people thought that Hitler was speaking live, directly to them, in their individual towns. As opposed to shittier, pre-recorded to vinyl, radio addresses.)

Wiseman say campfire tales event.
---
You could also look up acid in the "where to farm all the things" thread.
---
This is the stuff I come here for. Great job.
---
That‚Äôs good advice. 4 hunters ultracite laser pistols?
---
You‚Äôve worn out your welcome.
---
Not an official quest. Did you pick up rusty key when you got the alien blaster? Head over to Freddy‚Äôs fear shack and use it there around back upstairs to find te next clue.
---
Interesting point. I'll keep that in mind.
---
Get ready for a bunch of people with Raider flair to scream about PVP
---
True. You‚Äôll get most of your scrip back in exchange as well.
---
There‚Äôs kind of a nice appeal to the game just walking around. You don‚Äôt necessarily need to keep entering the same locations.
---
workshops are pvp arenas. if you claim one be aware you're essentially putting a big red target on your back.
---
and some people stalk servers for people with targets on their back.
---
lol
---
This is the new norm until the Survival servers return.
---
I use workshops for XP when leveling up new toons and have come to expect to get whacked sooner or later. A routine of claim / defend / run away with the occasional one-shot death mixed somewhere in between. It is what it is...
---
These are the dark levels. 
---
You‚Äôve got some perks, that‚Äôs great. What you don‚Äôt have is all the gear, room for the quality of life perks, etc. You‚Äôre also starting to stray into territory that higher levels are in, pushing the monster levels higher.
---
Things are going to get harder to kill, and you aren‚Äôt at the point where you can make lots of ammo quickly and easily.  Your shit is breaking, and unlike late game folks who can repair for cheap, you‚Äôre repairing at some high prices.
---
Some thoughts ...
---
* 50 is one break point, but really you may not feel comfortable until 75 or even 100. There will be perks you want to swap in you‚Äôll need to add. You‚Äôll probably want to swap your build around a bit. That‚Äôs a ways‚Äô off - enjoy in the meantime
---
* As others have said, try to explore more than stick to the main quest. It‚Äôll help.
---
* What platform are you on? Some folks here may be more than happy to help you with some gear, etc. 
---
* One trick I used a TON on my early character(s) was a turret base ... and I moved my camp near the big target. Need to kill a big beastie? Turrets. You may have to repair them, but they don‚Äôt run out of ammo as quick as you do.
---
* Unless it is seriously awesome legendary gear - don‚Äôt repair it. Don‚Äôt bother, it‚Äôs going to be cost prohibitive. Build new armor if armor.
---
With canning you have some fairly straightforward balancing options. Make the effects weaker, for one, and add a chance to catch botulism from improper canning.
---
This game is nothing  but the Point Lookout DLC on a larger scale. Doing things for dead folks.
---
I knew it was a risk but damn, we clearly didn‚Äôt know what we were doing, and at a low level compared to them. It sucks
---
This is an excellent design plan for canning to go off of
---
It does, and there's not really a reason for it. I understand people need a PVP outlet, but stealing workshops is super lame.
---
I say to balance out the canning process, maybe the effect of the food you canned is reduced. So instead of a food item giving 80 health regen, it only gives 50, or instead of +2 strength, it gives +1
---
No, it just has to do with your crafting of ammo
---
This would be amazing and would give me a whole new way of playing this game. I dreamed of having a 76 restaurant but the fast rate that food spoils kinda prevents that from being viable for a casual player.
---
My thoughts exactly.  The ESO ability to host players doing very different quests in the same area, while the environment is correctly different for each person is perfect for 76.
---
Also the option of becoming Wanted and wait for folks to come and try to kill you
---
That‚Äôs what I thought. Thanks.
---
Or effectiveness of the buffs could scale with Good With Salt perk tree. Maybe only Lvl 3 gets you the doesn't spoil, least amount of chance of disease, best buffs. Where Lvl 1 gets you slow spoil, moderate chance of diseases, OK buffs.
---
You can only get the Plasma Grenade plan in some of that region's events.
---
A work around to negating fridges and such, would be to have new recipes for canning. And you can ONLY make those recipes with said canning station. So no canning stuff like the recipes OP has listed. That would make the fridge still useful to store the normal food.
---
I‚Äôd suggest not taking the munitions factory unless you want people to challenge you, pretty much every handmade user is gonna try to grab it, I know every time I log on the first thing I do is try to take it so I can have ammo producing the entire time I‚Äôm playing, it is lame to not even claim the workshop though
---
Yeah, sucks when a high level just wants to kill you off without even claiming it. You can always hop servers and try again on there. Sucks to waste the caps. I think people like that only pvp when the people are lower level than them because they can‚Äôt cut it in NW where the playing field is more even.
---
I think the exchange rate would have to have another 0, otherwise I‚Äôd be abusing a scrip reset like crazy.
---
I‚Äôm so glad I farmed my fusion cores at power plant workshops before the survival server shutdown.
---
those ghouls would totally do that!
---
Fallout 4 New Vegas
---
Thing about that bug is that it was fixed by modders, which are greatly needed here.
---
Initiating pvp is only fun if they are a higher level than me imo. No fun killing off low levels. Might as well just swat radstags in the forest.
---
Like Todd said
---
I used to just do diluted, too. I found out "the hard way" at SBQ, I went to revive a dude and it only had the option to eat them with cannibal perk LOL, so I thought it was my cannibal perk making it unavailable, but it was lack of regular stims :)
---
Gotchya. It wasn‚Äôt claimed and we needed shells, so I thought it was a good idea. Like we had been on that server for about an hour before we did that. Stupid of me
---
Some people watch it and wait for it to be claimed before swooping in to initiate pvp
---
This happened to me yesterday ( PC ).  I think it's just a bug that happens occasionally though more often lately.
---
I usually swap servers.
---
No, not giving it back. Mine now.
---
I think it‚Äôs a great idea, but you know it‚Äôs going to get made and go straight into the atom shop after the success of the fridge.
---
You should have added a clause demanding royalties or a flat finder‚Äôs fee.
---
&gt;eats canned food
---
&gt;you've contracted botulism toxicity
---
&gt;dies
---
a nuked Whitesprings is a good place to get some of what you need. I find ghouls or scorched to be the best AI to farm for it. but they must have spawned in a nuke zone, and be in a nuke zone when they die.
---
I miss survival, I hope they bring it back. Although I wasn't a fan of the map marker system, I felt it should have been a quest bubble so that you could still easily find people, but not an exact position.
---
West Virginia, so....you‚Äôre saying you want slaves? How many confederate flag shirts do you own exactly?
---
There is no reason you couldn‚Äôt not swap between the two with static SPECIAL just altering your perk cards.
---
Are you inclined to stick in PA, stick out of PA or swap?
---
Two types of people, obviously the rich guy or kid with dads credit card. 
---
Second type is the most troubling, more often than not it's a tortured soul who isn't financially well off but needs to feel some kind of validation in their life and waste money on crap like this, it's really sad almost tragic tbh
---
I remember in D3 someone payed like 30k for a god rolled item on the real money auction house that was built into the game, before Blizz decided it was a bad idea and shut it down
---
Yes so much yes
---
lol thank you sir :) power armor for ever!!!
---
Does that help? I feel like it is happening to me constantly. I am tempted to swap out weapons...but I have no Legendary Ranged and no cards to assist so I am pretty much stuck with the melee or feeling like I am shooting with a bb.
---
I havent completed it before so it doesnt show up there.
---
I put in a ticket along time ago and my email back was basically we cant fix it sorry. Thanks for playing
---
This is a good idea. Please make the plan obtainable in-game, with skins in the shop.
---
You're better off doing 3* ranged. It'll cost you 50 but you get 40 back when scripping, meaning you paid 10 to roll the item. Doing 2* you'll pay 25 and get 15 back, meaning you also paid 10 to roll the item but it's not worth nearly as much.
---
Level 200
---
Yeah, sometimes would go a  while without seeing someone even when the server was full. It made things more interesting to keep your guard up. I played it even since I was a baby lvl 11 lol
---
My post was sponsored by Season 1 of AMC's *The Terror*
---
My dream gun. Saved 1k scrip on my main, see what happens.. I think she's been nerfed or it's random as heck right now.
---
It‚Äôs a known and unacknowledged bug.  Hopefully gets taken care of next patch and not broken patch after that.
---
That would be pretty dope! Seriously get 1/100 of the problems console players get. Most of my issue with the game comes from being a port and didn't do a very good job with contols.
---
And friends list. Jesus fix the fucking thing.
