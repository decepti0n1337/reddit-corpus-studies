Losing all your gear would be stupid.

---
If they somehow thought that it was a good idea and implemented it, you'd just get people going around it by moving their stuff over to a mule character/account before prestiging so it wouldn't accomplish anything other than annoying everyone.
---
Great Idea honestly. It would be a great way to track how people feel about things in the game and make appropriate adjustments. Also a good way to see if changes that are being made are helping or hurting the community

 (like wtf are these tedious Tadpole missions?? Or why spend energy on a camera when we already have a photo mode?? We don't even have a chat...)

I'm mean it's still berserkers. Might as well go bloodied if you want to be a glass cannon

This. Word definitely needs to get out about this.

I thought you didn't get XP for killing the Whitesprings robots?

I just want the ability to have your main C.A.M.P. and a secondary mobile camp with more limited build budget

 This would please me haha üòÅ

I went for the "full cleanse" and mutated myself into a herbivore.  I love gourds and melons now.  I eat soooo many melons.....  Giant, luscious melons every time I go back to my house until I'm packed full of juice.
---
My turds have also improved immensely since going vegan.
---
I imagine the melon is a boob, and that helped a lot during my transition.
---
I think I paid 3000 for my bloodied dragon
---
Added
---
Lmao. You win the thread sir.
---
I think they want to have the "available today" bomb at E3
---
Very helpful, thank you!
---
I'm intrigued to see how they'll do it. I kinda hope there are some new features or perks to be unlocked rather than just a title. But I think at the same time it can't be too OP because then the lower levels will ge terrified. I think it'll mostly only unlock cosmetic items for your camp and outfits to wear to show off
---
I'm also a single shot rifleman and shotgun user, also explosives. I'm a "ghoul soldier" mutated to the gills, in army uniform/helmet and gas mask with goggles to hide my deformed face. The backpack is great for carry weight! No mods works best for me so I get the full 60lbs bonus and no negative effects, can't for the life of me understand why high capacity reduces energy and rad resist, at least lowered capacity on the other mods makes some sense.
---
Don‚Äôt wear the same dress as her.
---
I'd love to have one of these in my CAMP cause the main building is dedicated to being a player HUB and I don't have a personal space yet.
---
They have to be aggro'd and red and actually shooting at you. If you one-shot a Mr. Handy, you get no points, but if you pick a fight with a Sentry and he's trying to kill you, you do.
---
If you are Xbox I'll help you out.
---
Listen, like everyone else is saying, to reason. You are being ignorant, op
---
Not sure.  It just got destroyed when I dropped it.
---
I'm a min maxer so my armor looks cobbled from different pieces. What ever has better effects
---
Did you notice that everything you said was probably not even a 10% of new "lineal to develop" content?
---
The overall main mechanics were not improved or upgraded from F4 (which are harder to develop) and the game doesnt compensate it with more "lineal to develop" content, that of course its much easier to develop that something "fresh" or more complex.
---
All of this not even taking on count the multiple bugs, problems or exploits the game had because they developed a multiplayer game on an engine just not polished enough for it.
---
\*and about the costumes... first for me they should not be here (if they dont meet the lore, just move them away) but even if you like it, the prizes for them are still a joke.. they could put them in the store for free or at a good price... but its not the case.
---
New vegas improved the whole amount of options related to dialogue/missions, with much more options than F3, of course reused content (what I always said to some people that thinks F3 is a 2/10 but FNV deserves a 12/10) but at the same time they improved on the amount of those "lineal to develop" content, like adding new weapons, factions, creatures etc...   what did f76? create a new "green resking" for every creature and say "they are schorched"?
---
One thing is Reuse minor elements, and other thing its develop some "monuments"/ unique buildings and try to mask other 90% of elements that were already developed and call that a new game.
---

For now I'm focusing on selling 2-3\* armor at my camp. One thing I've noticed CAMP hopping is while there's lots of ammo specialists and serum specialists and plans specialists and junk specialists and weapons specialists and clothing specialists there's hardly any armor specialists. So right now I've got over 40 pieces of 2-3\* armor for sale with a heavy lean on marine, combat and scout armor for the experienced player (and some leather, metal, trapper and robot armor, for the weirdos and cheapskates out there).
---
That being said I do have a deep bench of a wide variety of weapons that I plan on letting go once I sell down my armor stash. So if there's a particular type of rifle you've got your eye on (gauss, lever, hunting) or something a little stronger (combat rifle, handmade) or even on the heavy side (gatling, 50 cal, LMG, minigun) or a particular effect (I collect anti-armors but I've got a fair selection of most legendary types save for junkies and nocturnal.
---
YES! Never seen so many MEDIC crap or VATS enhanced stuff. Where's the good stuff?  Amazing on how junkies, VATS, and Medic seem predisposed for certain people.  I have NOTHING with medic or  Junkies ever in inventory, but I keep getting handed hot garbage from her.  This is not following the speculated rules for normal legendary drops.
---
I love how the mission is basically "Prepare a dinner for sheepsquatch and then kill it"
---
Good to know thank you
---
hm I use a lever so so not as strong, but still its not a strong as bloodie and not very good in pvp
---
Hemlock holes has three acid resources. They collect 60 acid per hour and you need 1 acid to turn 2 ore into 5 lead or steel.
---
I'm a heavy gunner and get pipe weapons, crossbows, etc.  Exact opposite of what my invetory has in it.  Maybe pack my inventory with complete pipe garbage and crossbows and see if I get a TSE gatling or Vampiric explosive gatling.
---
Well i do use excavator when i'm overencumbered or when i have to join a queen fight that is placed by a newb.
---
It's a nice trick anyway. I'd prefer this than diying from a bug sneeze with bloodied.

It‚Äôs very close to Solomon‚Äôs pond iirc

You would need some way to change type but not make it as easy as putting on armour 
---
So if you want super mutant you need something from an enclave base and to do a 5-10 min quest 
---
To get rid of super mutant you need the shit you found mix it with something else and take it
---
For ghoul either take a fuck ton of rads like 50-100% rads and then have a chance to become a ghoul or do some quest involving glowing blood to make a chem to become a ghoul 
---
To stop being a ghoul you would need to take some rad away + stimpak and you would not be a ghoul anymore
---
Super mutants should be able to wear power armour without a frame but it‚Äôs a bit worse
---
Yeah sometimes I have pain train on and I am like 20 ft away from the bots and when I run past them they randomly start killing me

Why dont we just all have unlimited stash space without working for it?

 Why dont we all hold those gigabytes on our computers and let bethesda deal with ‚Äúpetty concerns‚Äù?

Why dont we just get bored cause we have 10k gears and springs and ballistic fibre?

Stupid comment.

Aren't the atom shop versions of in game items clean versions instead of the normal grungy look?

I had this issue with a CAMP I just built last night: 3/4 times that I would fast travel to it I ended up beneath the floor (it was above water and I was using the wooden floors on poles as my floor).
---
I ended up having to break it all down and replacing the floor with solid concrete blocks which fixed the issue, but was really annoying to do.
---
Ah, neat.
---
Well I for one leave them alone as they have a very important job defending the Whitesprings from rapscallions and vagrants like yourself.
---
you people are insane
---
It should be the same for a lot of things like playing instruments, sitting, sleeping, and of course drinking, etc. The amount of time I've accidentally interacted with the wrong thing...
---
Maybe it could also be added to work benches cause I often press the wrong menu for that and the animation takes a while.

Excavator power armor. With all the repair perks you can repair it to 200%. It can take a ton of hits before it needs repaired again. Add to that it gives more ore when used to mine being. An extra 
---
100 carry weight. With calibrated shocks another 100 carry weight. Then there's the bug that will add yet another 100. Then you have all the mods like medic pump that makes it near impossible for you to be killed unless you play stupid. Targeting hud that outlines enemies before you would normally see them. There's many good armor's. Each has its place. And in Fallout power armor has always been the top pick. In 76 that may be broken like the rest of the game I am sorry to say.
---
I started a new character this morning and the first thing i did after getting to the overseers camp was run straight for Whitesprings. 
---
when i got there i spent a few minutes putting one bullet into the level 62 ghouls there and then running for the safety and free XP of papa sentry bot, and then after that i walked into the main building and just picked up literally every single thing in the entire place and sold it all at the vendors there.  
---
i walked in with about thirty caps and left with over seven hundred for about six or seven minutes of work.
---
Doubt it.  Most likely you sold it, dropped it, don't see it, or its in your stash.
---
insane.... with Appalachia mutations
---
I don't think that's the guest but people from the bunker. I thought modus murdered them in a skynet type situation.
---
Report back!
---
Just throw on locks and start with the 3 junk piles. Then go off and do your own thing. Dont worry about turrets or anything else. Combing thru Charleston while you let 3x junk work nets me a lot of screws and gears which i always seem to be in need of.
---
that may explain why every pop-up in this game has blood splattered across the floor

I‚Äôve got a bezerkers handmade for you!

I have no idea what could be causing this, but have you tried to 'scan and repair' from the Bethesda launcher?

I was playing or I would've gotten back to you sooner.
---
Should you need any further English lessons let me know.
---
White Knight perk reduces the cost of repairing armor dramatically.  If you still have problems then iirc trappers doesn't require ballistic fiber and is thus the cheapest to repair.  
---
Weight is more a function of mods and if the armor is light sturdy or heavy.  You can offset it in most cases by adding the deep pocketed mod.  But really any "light" armor won't have massive weight penalties.  
---
Lastly, a lot of your concerns are aspects of gameplay rather than armor.  So for example a ranged/sniper build will take less damage, and thus rarely have to repair armor.  A melee build will take a lot more damage.  So taking perks like white knight "always on" makes sense for melee but the sniper would only pop that perk in when it's time to repair.
---
I will enjoy putting mini nukes in them and watching them burn. 
---
AmA. Ive fixed a lot of stupid campers.
---
I've been collecting and crafting robot helmets since beta, and now they keep getting snapped up but I don't want to put multiple in because it'll eat the stock limit and bloat my armor listing
---
Even the cheap lvl 1 lock will make someone wanted if they pick it. If your not there no on can kill you either. You get notice for a defend and even if you miss it you can go back and fight 1 wave and repair your extractors. 
---
Just make sure your going to be on for a bit and stop by and clear them out in a stash box every so often. Ez pz
---
Yup.
---
I learned the hard way shooting a explosive shotgun shell into a behemoth that was swarmed by bots.
---
Then everything turned red and they fired volleys of lasers at me.

Fun times.

ROFL, did you even look at that? You just shared the synonyms of suspension and look at that, ban isn't there. Maybe I should offer you some lessons on reading comprehension.
---
I'd still invite you over to my camper
---
I wish people would aim better when hitting Whitesprings. They got the club house and most of the golf course. My base normally is far enough to avoid getting destroyed... except for the one time, like I mentioned above, where someone nuked the golf course for some reason... they did get the club house too... The actual resort and a few of the other houses were not hit by the bomb.
---
I am experiencing the same issue and it's super frustrating. I spend the caps to travel there b/c of what it says is for sale... Then I get there and it's just empty. WTF Bethesda...
---
Yess!!!! At least the flare gun in Fallout 4 had a purpose. But still didn‚Äôt use it, I just dropped it. 
---
Would love to see something like this in the game! Or at least make a mini event for shooting your flare gun at certain areas e.g. if you shoot a flare at the whitesprings several hostile sentry bots come rolling to the location the flare has been shot from.  Would be awesome if Bethesda added something like this!
---
you already made a post, why make another without the video ?
---
Ehh, I‚Äôm getting old, you‚Äôre fine
---
Yeah. Make it so that it requires two people to set it up, such that it could be used to provide nearby support at an event, like outside an sbq or Sheepsquatch or something.
---
Should be... but looking at the preview it's not clean at all.
---
Have got an Irish friend whom the game refuses to let me join or add to a team, unless we start a team in the main menu!

Ill make sure to leave a stack of screws behind then.

Good on you!

meh, variety is the spice of life :P

Ok thanks for the idea

nice!
---
That's Elvis.  Or Murky.  I keep switching between names.  He's my guard dog.  It's kinda funny watching him get in a shouting match with the (thankfully rare) scorchbeast random encounter.
---
Lol. Thanks, but no thanks.
---
With unstable servers and main menu friends list dead drops don't work. I've lost a few dead drops I tried doing on a friend's server and when I go to join again it says main menu. When I can finally join it seems they switched servers and my drop is gone. Don't do dead drops right now!! Transfer items through a trusted friend.
---
Bethesda forgot the story of the "Lone Wanderer".
---
Yes please. It's gone on too long.

Wtf are you talking about?

that room is the presidential suite, it will be used for a quest to elect a new president.

Once elected the president gets tokens to buy special gear, a power armor, a scout armor etc..

This isn't going to happen.

That's what was a phenomenal part of New Vegas, you could get crit's outside of vats. It always boggles me that they locked crits behind vats for no good reason. It inhibits the enjoyment of playing in the typical (and advertised) first person

If anything it would be a "I had it first" club.

It‚Äôs supposed to yes. Almost every time I log out or switch servers it stays. However sometimes it will randomly die or disappear, it‚Äôs very buggy
---
It‚Äôs a bug.
---
Your choice at this point
---
Exactly. People are so bloody lazy in this game and want to be spoon fed. I work full time and got the backpack in 2 nights, by looking online for tips and then doing the god damn quests. It's not hard. 
---
They will never be tradeable. Agreed.
---
You will find it still running in your hidden tray icons. Close it there and it will no longer do that.
---
That's how I feel. It'd take them like 2 seconds to change x% boost to y% boost but a lot more resources to try and get other things to match it
---
I rather not, accidentally hit one vendor and all of Whitesprings will hone in on you and try to kill you. I've accidentally hit the Whitesprings robots a few times while trying to kill ghouls and/or Death Claws. The WHOLE building will agro and all come to where you are to kill you. I've been inside while they were upset at me and I swear EVERY robot in the building (all floors) came downstairs to shoot me.
---
I rather not engage in fire fights where they are nearby actively swarming an enemy to kill them.
---
(Note: I often will shoot an enemy 1-2 times to get the EXP but if a robot is nearby I just let it finish the mob).
---
What is the bunker?
---
What's B25?
---
Find leadership bobblehead. 5% bonus exp for 1 hr. Path of enlightenment event gives 5% bonus exp for 1 hr. There are a few foods that give a %bonus for exp too.
---
What's B25 or BE?
---
10? I saw once 30-40 of them. I took a couple pictures and video of it, it was insane
---
I was doing a mission in the water park think it was the one about the missing kid. When I went in the mail box for one of the items it triggered like 6 level 50 behemoths to spawn. At the time I think I was only a lvl 15 but 2 of them got stuck killed all 5 by sitting on the slides took me about an hour lol
---
Because I'm guessing they were saying they wanted to get enough atoms from challenges, + buying some for them to get the outfit. But it's not enough atoms from just buying the lower amount and don't want to buy the higher.
---
And a molerat just burrowed into your home.
---
Bloodied builds usually get 1 tapped. What's so meta about that? Asking for a friend.
---
I want to feel the wrath of downvotes. I think that bloodied needs to be nerfed in PvP at least, It's just way too easy to be one shotted without any real fight. A glass cannon can still be stored away hundreds of feet or take a super stimpak and rush with their dern kangaroo hops. I don't even think it needs to be nerfed by much, just if I'm in full top level power armor with full health its not fair at all to be one shotted in a non-sneak situation. Either that or they just need to buff a counter to bloodied which is probably wayyyy more work
---
Get your self a baseball uniform there's on that spawn across the charlstion station cap. A baseball bat, face paint and up your malee perks and carry around lots of baseball gernades. Geta whole group together and start calling yourselves the Furies!

I leave you a bag of antibiotics then!

I didnt bring up game mechanics, overall content, and multiple bugs and the engine difficulties because that's not what we were talking about.  The conversation wasnt about comparing 76 and 4 in all ways, it was specifically about the outfits and skins.  You do make very good points, but they're just not really valid and seem like goalpost moving.  Loads of bugs have been fixed, and they fix more with every patch, including stability.  Personally I dont remember the last time I disconnected, though I do know it's way more prevalent on PS4, which is par for the course with PS4 and Bethesda games sadly.  I dont have a reason other than architecture of the systems (I remember people having the same complaints about crashes with skyrim and fo4) and conflicts with the engine.
---
As for enemies, theres loads more than just scorched that are new.  You're forgetting sloths, mole miners, liberators, wendigo, sheepsquatch and probably a few more that I'm forgetting.  Nothing major in fight mechanics, but they're new and different, and arent just reskins
---
It‚Äôs just like fallout 4. You need to put them on the timer switch (a power connector, I forgot the name) and a terminal to adjust the on/off cycle time.
---
It‚Äôs not ideal, but they will work.
---
If you already have it on PS4 you might as well wait for the Steam version.
---
Na you're just imagining it. For sure we'd notice it [if there was something behind us](https://imgur.com/a/i1P4Db9)
---
My bad I'm busy with actually playing the game and I already showed you once where the two words are interchangeable what's your hang up with it. 
---
If the UK uses ban instead of Suspension and they created English over there what more do you need. I already saw the xenophobic remark you made about Reddit being a US website which you immediately deleted and or edited.
---
Makes me question why I'm wasting my time here. I know what type of person you are.
---
I got most of my badges from campfire tales. They dropped for me about 60% of the time.
---
Wood and steel for a brick wall?
---
Concrete, there‚Äôs 7 or 8 sacks of it past the Watoga vendor behind and around the chemistry station and 3 more down at Lewis and Sons Farming Supply in the barn.
---
I never claimed to be smart
---
well.. ok
---
They need to buff it tbh. Or nerf bloodied. Cause the best defense is resistance not hp. Especially when everyone is doing 1000 damage because of bloodied
---
Exactly what I do and I do miss that glitch. Of all the things that need fixing in the game they fix that one haha
---
Related to that it would be great if when we get sent to a new world when our CAMP spot is taken that we actually get sent to a world where the CAMP can be placed (or get notified if every server is taken). I'm in a less busy place now but I had to server jump again and again before cause it kept putting me in taken servers.

Is there a cosmetic difference?

Where you launch nukes from, full of bots.

I have them on a terminal, but il look for the timer switch havent noticed that one

You can find some near a marked pylon location, not sure what number though. It‚Äôs in the VERY VERY bottom of the map, in the Savage Divide region between the Cranberry Bog and the Ash Heap. I‚Äôll PM you links for videos about concrete farming too
---
Some on the New River Gorge bridge, 3-4 sacks, near the truck/trailer with radioactive barrels around it.
---
Another 3 will spawn in Black Hole Mine right in the Uranium Fever area, but I'm not sure how the spawn works. I always see it during the event, whenever I just check it at random they aren't there.
---
The Monorail elevator will have like 5 bags iirc.
---
Between these spots I think anyone would be set ;)
---
I think it may correspond to a certain mod
---
Bloodied with 25% faster fire rate and bloodied with explosive. I usually say ffr instead of 25, but B25 just has better ring to it
---
They glow because berry tats highlight "living" things
---
just trying to say that one game content (all involved) should justify its price at all... They did worked for free for F4 or they did F 76 with less interest.
---
*I agree that its just not as I stated, As I dont have a full list of every content at all on my mind, but still it looks a very mediocre development by bethesda game studios from my point of view.
---
*2 about the bugs, Im talking about server problems (like how you spawn, for example inside camps are related to this) or when you dropped ammo or stuff on forbidden places (like the food event machine) or problems related to carry weight and/ or power armors, or with CAMP budget... all of em way away to be considered "secondary, low-priority bugs"
---
PS: By the way Im surprised there is still people on reddit that just doesnt downvote everything without pretending to talk about it, even if we see different things here I salute you!
---
Would be great advice if server hoping made a difference. But blocking them does nothing. Video reports do nothing. That's a pideo of pvtpelnar. Who I have submitted tons of videos of. Nothing has ever been done.
---
Theres a perk that makes them last 200%, Power User under Intelligence.

I do it all the time, was not the case, I always open task manager later I checked hidden tray icons.

In the words of Bruce Hornsby and The Range, that's just the way it is. Super laggy and glitchy at the moment.
---
The damage output is so much higher that not having a bloodied build or two at an endgame event is bad. Any guide on how to "melt a boss" includes bloodied builds.
---
Well considering my .50 cal only takes enemies down to 1 HP and then they heal entirely, and my Gatling plasma only gets whatever random amount shots per core (usually whatever amount of cores I'm carrying), I'm considering giving it up entirely.

---
When they work, they work well. But as of right now, unless I'm the only one getting these bugs, I'd only use the gatling laser.

Which doesn't seem to have these insufferable bugs.
---
They really are.
---
Source: owned one for 4 years, best day was when I traded it for a $250 Mosin Nagant.
---
Very useful
---
Flare guns distracting scorchbeasts &gt;&gt;&gt;

There is no lone wanderer in this one. There wasn‚Äôt one in 4 either. The one in 4 was the sole survivor. This game is based around rebuilding Appalachia, not saving your dad or finding your stolen son. Technically if you go by lore, the lone wanderer is not even a twinkle in his fathers eye when 76 takes place.
---
Thanks!
---
Sorry, was meant to say BURROWS
---
He was not "hiding", he was sleeping (face down in the pond). I seriously ran into him cuz I didn't notice him but then I ran back up to him and was waiting for him to start chasing me or attacking, but nothing. So I make my way to the shore and it wasn't until like the fifth shot before he woke up and started attacking me
---
Had to turn to google last night to find out where to take the shooting test for archery
---
I found some sort of jumping puzzle up in some trees somewhere.  
---
I couldn't get to the end, but it was when I first started playing.  
---
I have been looking for it ever since I found it because I didn't bother remembering where it was.
---
I'm not a Bethesda white knight here to say they did no wrong.  It was a secondary studio, new to the engine, with the daunting task of making it multiplayer and fun.  At launch, they barely accomplished both, but I feel like their work since both in creating content and fixing mechanics deserves credit.  76 isnt FO4, but reuses a good amount of content.  They created memorable, unique environments utilizing those assets.  Think of your first time in the Ash Heap, going into Belching Betty or the Burning Mine, or the Mire, if you're like me and stopped to marvel at the vines suspending buses and entire chunks of land.  
---
It's not FO5 either, and that's disappointing, but I love the game for what it is.  I took a break for a month or two and came back and found many if the things I hated were fixed, like vendor caps, lack of worthwhile loot and an abysmal trade menu that vendors fixed.  
---
And yeah, definitely man, im happy to defend the game to someone that doesnt take 76's flaws personally.  You make entirely good points about the flaws, and the game is only getting better to me, so I'm happy to defend what I enjoy.
---
Compared to the rest of the airport, that camper is so clean and I neED IT
---
Nice! A few minutes ago I got back home from running uranium fever and there was a level 36 shopping at my machines. I invited him to trade, looked at his hodgepodge of armor, and figured him a level 35 trapper leg with chameleon and AP refresh.
---
He started jumping around doing heart emotes, so I think he liked it ü§î
---
One of my favourite perks. Never use power armor without it!
---
I know it‚Äôs been months but if you‚Äôre still free to do this can you do the same for me? I‚Äôll chuck you a couple of hundred caps for your troubles
---
Screw the bag!
---
About 100 more times, preferably daily, before the mods get their head out of their ass and retire this to the ‚ÄúBethesda plz‚Äù list. But really this is getting old. I think bethesda gets it, no need to constantly repeat yourself like a little kid trying to get candy.
---
One time I plugged in my mic to talk to another player, he ended up stalking my character and spamming my xbox messages saying I looked and sounded pretty. I'm a 23 year old guy and my character is a 60 year old man. Needless to say I keep it unplugged now and mute people's GT
---
White knight perk helps with armour repair costs I believe
---
It's not a glitch, it's intended. When you die you lose any weight carrying bonuses like excavator and pockets. If you're over your "natural" carrying capacity your fucked.
---
You have two options: don't carry so much, or don't die.
---
honey beast is about the size of a yao guai really big for a bee but not as big as a queen
---
I believe it will return items to their not for sale state in your stash. You will have to relist them.
---
I was gonna buy 5/18 of the power armor before I was enlightened by the laminate
---
uh the meat hook is an entirely different weapon
---
Turn the power off to the machines so you stop showing up on the map, and then go spend some money.
---
My recommendation is don‚Äôt die lol, on the serious note, I‚Äôm on PS4 and never experienced this, I know ppl have this but it will be interesting to find out, what does trigger this bug. Like your character is overweight without PA and even thou you using it, it won‚Äôt register after death and let you spawn only at 76? Want to get to the bottom of this.
---
 This is awesome! Is there a way to have the list organize itself so what ever is ready to vendor is at the top of the list?
---
Also frustrating .....  VENDOR:  Owned by (blank) ........ you can fast travel there but there is no camp.
---
Yup just get a nuclear keycard, do a silo run, and enter the nukacrypt code for the silo you‚Äôre running.
---
This is a cool idea but the issue is that dynamic camp elements (light sources or things that move) are extra heavy on the server. Adding an additional texture/layer to that already heavy item would further limit the number of letters the system can render, so you‚Äôd have to sacrifice quantity for quality or vice versa.
---
Ok that makes more since thanks
---
I know where most of the cores are located and never have trouble finding enough.
---
Yeah, people sucking is a big issue for me. Plus in this game there used to be a lot of exploits where people could steal from or insta kill you, I'm now traumatized from that. Randoms keep inviting me to trades and I'm just like NOPE!
---
Ya can still buy from them though.
---
I like this. It would differentiate what I personally want to prioritize.
---
I find it hilarious that a game they put emphasis on being community has no fucking text chat or means of communication on some consoles. Literally mute join block unfriend. Should of put it on Steam firsthand
---
That's crazy. Abby's bunker had a cave in lol
---
There are Trouble shooters for encrypid. There is Zealots for Scorched plus scortch killer mods...the 2shot just got buffed so they are very good again against SBQ and other enemies.
---
Nice to hear
---
does it include the hat and the glasses as separate items?
---
I agree. However, just some insight into what MAYBE the devs where thinking, perhaps, they thought that it would be easier for people to just open the map and see "okay, these are the challenges I'm working on.". Instead of scrolling through to see what they are currently doing.
---
There seems to be nothing here. I'll be on my way then
---
If you put whatever you are ready to sell to the "I have" Column, the top of the list prioritize those items and tell you how many items you are missing. 
---
Let me know if I have misunderstood your question.
---
Never cared for junkies or nocturnal myself. But ok I'll keep an eye out for your camp, hopefully I can find you on one of the servers.
---
Most what you listed is problem for ppl that want everything right now. I‚Äôm playing the game ignoring the challenges and still got lot of them done, just by exploring. Yes it will take me time to do them all but some are not even possible to finish so I‚Äôm not bothered. Got all badges from campfire event and now I‚Äôm running two backpacks with armored and weight increased.
---
I personally remember all that crap because if I'm doing challenges, I'm doing just them. But I understand everyone else's points
---
Some people just think about themselves, good thing there are still people like you around to lend a hand. Cheers!
---
I know, but if you're not on the map people are less likely to find you unless you're camped somewhere obvious like the hill across the tracks from Whitesprings station.
---
Other than stashing your machines and relisting things later, it's your only real option.
---
Put walls and a roof around the machine
---
Oh, I forgot I'm on PS4. Should have mentioned that.
---
Heavy guns are pretty good now, and so are laser weapons
---
Come to think of it, I picked up a deathclaw hide the other day and scrapped it on accident. Welp.
---
Who is Digo and why is he/she in G?
---
Request like these make me wonder how the game load is built. Because it feels like some of this stuff should be common sense. I can still see how devs overlook stuff like this though.
---
I think that just creates the whole ‚Äúsafe space‚Äù mentality. I‚Äôm not sure how many played diablo 2 but after each run through of completing the game you opened a new difficulty and you kept your player and gear all the way up to level 100 but the enemies got stronger and more legendary effects like vampiric teleportation or certain vulnerabilities. On top of that there were huge hordes of ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù mobs which would be really cool IMO. Imagine a mob of lvl 80 or 91 legendary deathclaws coming at you immune to explosives üò¨. But I think this is dreaming and seeing as how things have been I think you may be right. Like trophies or cosmetic things like the faschnaut masks
---
He‚Äôs wrong.
---
None of the above. That's Bethesda's excuse for poor work. I have played this game every day for 5 months and know better. Just crap work by Bethesda.
---
I've seen a grand total of 0 in my play time across all platforms.
---
Was it used?
---
No it isn't. Don't engage. Wasteland Justice.
---
Wish we could use ultracite cores in power armor
---
You can one hit some max level enemies with a rolling pin if you do it right. If they just gave the flare gun level scaling, and legendaries I'd love to use it as a real weapon. Have some flashbacks to killing zombies with the flare gun in Blood back in the day.
---
I have never, ever seen a mod for a sickle. I am one of those guys who picks up every single piece of armor and weapon and scraps it for the chance to learn a new mod.
---
No, the 500 atom code was not used.
---
Yeah. I want to be able to sell strange meat dishes! I've been wanting to open my restaurant, Butcher Clete's Strange Meats, since before the game was released. The fact I can't make strange meat dishes is a travesty! They already have a perfect group for it and everything: the Gourmands.
---
It doesnt require a master mind to look where people are and run there and fill the collector up and kill the rad stags or molerats
---
There is 3 power plants that can all produce fusion cores. You can also make fusion cores with enough stabilised nuked flora.
---
I am on PC. I‚Äôm not sure about my preferred build playstyle yet. Need to experiment. 
---
Big thanks tho dude. I am going to refer back to this comment next time I hop on.
---
I got a two shot explosive Gatling laser but I heard TSE weapons got nerfed
---
Are you running any game mods? Ones that mess with textures at all seem to break the game pretty hard and pretty randomly. Think "glowing" magazines, etc.
---
That's fucking dumb.
---
If you got the right perks there still good
---
Big thanks tho dude. I am going to refer back to this comment next time I hop on. üíØ
---
That's actually a good theory thanks for sharing your thoughts
---
I understand. The majority of my gameplay is PVE as well, but I tend to claim multiple workshops at once to maximize the amount of junk I can acquire per session so I‚Äôve had to balance my build so that I can take and hold workshops. There‚Äôs lots of ways to hold your workshops against high level players, as long as you keep crouched to mess with their V.A.T.S (and get sneak attack damage when possible) and use an automatic weapon or an armor piercing shotgun you should be able to keep other players from just steamrolling you unless they‚Äôre part of the minority rolling around with all perfect gear.
---
You spent a few thousand caps? On what? The underarmor is free from the Enclave questline, the shield underarmor plans are a static world spawn and the mats are easily farmable.
---
I like the way you think.
---
If you're gonna be a pedant, at least spell scrip right.
---
How do people have trouble with free range? I've never had any issues soloing it and I use mediocre 1 star weapon legendaries...
---
Oh yeah? And if there are no other people, brainiac?
---
I used to drop most chems, ammo,legendary and plans to appropriate level guys around Appalachia for the first 500h. Hated to sell legendary for 10caps. Ppl loved it if they noticed I drop a present for them lol. But now with player vending and Purveyor, most is used selfishly for my wealth. Except very low players, I still drop lot of plans and chems when I meet them.
---
You bought it new from amazon for $10?  
---
Your going to need to add a link or something to help, platform maybe?   I‚Äôm seeing $35 new $20 used on amazon for PC
---
I agree pop up campers are the worst. Source 5 years owning a Rockwood pop up. I have a travel trailer now, every time we back into a site with the TT I'm reminded how much of a pain in the ass it was to set the pop up up.
---
Plague Walker scales 0 damage (no diseases) into aggro. Makes my cow hate me. It doesn't seem to bother robot friendlies.
---
Today, the Queen was bugged in the air standing still for 5 minutes we almost fully killed it by simply hitting above our headst... Then, it landed and it also stayed still with the audio bug that makes your ears tear out... So, it seems the Queen is buggier than the usual these days.
---
I kind of wish they let us each have our own instanced bunkers/vaults that we could raid like some fallout D&amp;D action going on. Who knows what is planned for future updates.
---
GameStop.
---
I just didn‚Äôt play with it enough, This is awesome! Thanks for the hard work
---
Ever any questions, wouldnt mind answering them.
---
Ahh thanks thats good news!
---
Gotcha. Shoutout to cap caps.
---
No it was not used, and it was on Xbox for 8$, used. Should‚Äôve stated what console in my title. And I can‚Äôt post links here.
---
Ive found them at The train stations in the Ash Heap. Welsh and Lewisburg
---
Gotcha. I‚Äôm level 100 I think so I got all the heavy weapon and power armor related perks. I‚Äôll give it a go for now but I‚Äôm hoping to eventually move out of power armor, which is kind of required for heavy weapon builds unfortunately.
---
Well see... I never GET that far.
---
I had to use Edge just to get anything to even happen, as both Firefox and normal IE doesn't register anything when I click the "Get" button on the store page. However, in Edge it gave a popup dialogue that, hilariously, said I need an App to open this and since there were no choices provided in the list, it suggested I find one on...the Microsoft Store &gt;_&gt; heh
---
Nice. I‚Äôll be there soon. Junk and chems? This guy parties.
---
Awesome, I'll check that out. Thank you so much!
---
Just choose a site out of 3 i want to fill up, what about it?
---
Not too hard right?
---
You can craft the undrerarmor to a higher lvl of protection. There's 3 lvls above the free one you get in the quest. You have to get the plans for each lvl from a vendor. They don't drop anywhere else.
---
Why would they kill themselves though? Then they dont get the xp from killing the other people.
---
I have a friend who walks around like a God, has perfect gear he rarely takes damage and when he does it's such a small amount and every shot he fires just rips through most enemies. I hate playing with him because I can't kill anything if he just starts shooting.
---
3* enemies should drop 2* items at the lowest, IMO. 2* enemies can drop 1-2*, etc.
---
DONE

This might help.

That'd be silos.
---
Nothing better than finding a crashed space ship on my way to shady sands. Those scorpions in the cave put up a good fight, but they couldn't really fight the power of the OG alien blaster
---
You can earn Possum badges by:
---
1. Completing World Possum Challenges
---
2. Completing the event Campfire Tales (slight change, it seems to depend on your luck and the number of players doing the event)
---
3. Completing the repeatable Pioneer Scout Sting &amp; Things and Toxic Sludge (same thing as above, it's a very slight chance and it also depends on your luck)
---
I have 11 points in Luck and I generally get one badge every 3-4 completed Campfire Events, I got 3 backpack mods that way. I feel like it's the easiest and quickest way to do get Possum Badges. I hope that helps. Cheers!
---
Which event?...
---
He's lying. Might aswell sell it to me for 50 caps :P
---
Shielded plans are at Tanagra Town.
---
The brahmin die as soon as I reach the farm and all the baddies spawn, getting them there isn't too hard neither is killing the squatches it just takes time.
---
Thank you, share it with Friends to increase your chances.
---
I mean in my experience nobody really throws down over Hemlock Holes but if that‚Äôs your experience I can understand that position.
---
At least your still giving
---
I agree some decisions were insteps but if it‚Äôs not you complaining about one thing it‚Äôll be somebody else for another. It doesn‚Äôt actually matter what they do as someone‚Äôs gonna be pissed
---
That would be perfect for glamping at Burning Man. 
---
and use urban dictionary if you don't know what glamping is
---
I was mainly looking at repair costs but this helps
---
How about shooting something and it gives a debuff to hit with VATS since it is lit up. Throw in some perk cards and you can increase the duration and add some other effects like maybe lowering armor or something.
---
My id's different from my screen name. It's somenorcalguy and I'm on PC. Camp is on the intersection next to Appalachia Antiques in the Bog under the Nuka cranberry sign.
---
They kill themselves so their survival score resets and they won't see on map, meanwhile they can see new top 3 and kill them and reapeat over and over again.
---
If you have auto update on it will update as soon as you start the launcher. The message will show after that.
---
It's not "throws down over" It's "I've had griefers who have no interest in workshops fast travel in exclusively because they want to  grief someone". 
---
That is _every single_ instance of someone taking over a workshop from me that I have experienced, as I never go after the munitions factory. It is NEVER someone who legitimately wants the workshop, it is _always_ a griefer, exploiting badly designed game mechanics to force their bullshit "Murder is fun for me and I don't give a shit if you hate it" play-style on others. 
---
The system has been badly implemented from the start.
---
Exactly. When someone buys one of the costume items in my shop, I replace it, but i'll never have, say, more than one army uniform or engineers outfit listed.
---
What's bunker then? The free states bunkers?
---
Yea theyre survival score resets so they cant be seen but im pretty sure when they die and it restes they wont get any xp. So only point would be to be a jerk i guess
---
Poweruser....perk card. 3 levels, 3rd level doubles power core duration...
---
I mean, I have it... but I'm not elitist about it, I don't even rock it anymore (although I did for a loooong time)
---
I'll help, LeftTurn36_
---
Any opinions on apex nano line? We've had our 193bhs about 6 months now and it's been perfect but you're always dreading the first big thing to go wrong on it.
---
I fear that we'll have to wait until Wastelanders at the end of this year to get any story content with actual meat to it - I enjoyed Wasted on Nukashine and Lying Lowe but they were paper thin and only served to introduce the player to the new crafting system/event. 
---
I feel like a broken record here but Zenimax Online Studios are amazing at catering to the solo players; despite ESO being a full MMO they've released tonnes of narrative-driven compaigns that make you feel like you're playing a single-player game, as well as dropping team-based dungeons and raids on top of that. Looking at it that way it's a shame I prefer Fallout to Elder Scrolls, and I'm not trying to deminish the work BGS have put into 76 I'm just saying a lot of this DLC isn't what I had personally hoped for.
---
None of it works, because you can't wear backpacks while in PA.
---
I can tell you from experience.. sounds better than it is. I placed my camp down halfway up a cliff, so I could build a lead collector up above, and an acid collector inside a cave..
---
I didn't pay attention to how close I was to a fissure. I averaged 2-3 scorch beast **every few minutes**(as well as scorch enemies all over every time) whether I was there or not. Camp constantly destroyed.
---
I mean.. it's worth it for the experience, but my friends begged me to move, they just felt overwhelmed anytime they visited.
---
Is that what it is?? Moving the camera? I get this all the damn time and will be careful now.
---
That weapon is worth over 25k to some people, FYI. Explosive energy weapons no longer exist as drops, so it‚Äôs a legacy weapon. Plus, energy weapons just got a buff. Captainoob posted his video on that gun today (it kills everything): https://youtu.be/JqeDa-Ht06Y
---
I bought a headset just to try and have some way to communicate besides frantically playing charades. My main is lvl 170 something and current char is lvl 87.
---
I have yet to see any evidence that my mic works other than the little icon in the corner of the screen popping up when I make enough racket. This is including attempting conversation, general hey / hello stuff, playing theme from jeopardy tune when someone is seemingly afk at my camp and I want to log off...
---
I may steal this idea!
---
True, the quantum paint as well. I thought they removed the keypad to get to the shielded operative underarmor?
---
only if it uses alot of materials.
---
maybe balistic fibers and fluxes.
---
so that you cant instantly produce 200 with some cloth and make a giant profit.
---
Well I‚Äôm playing quite a lot and if I can‚Äôt sell it anymore that day, why just waste it. Give it to others . My problem is, I always see the stimpack, thinking I got enough, just leave it there for someone, but I just need to collect it for my self and then I‚Äôm over weight and have to drop it lol
---
&gt; and suppressor is missing texture looks like big fucking violet dildo 
---
I'm laughing and crying at the same time
---
If you're on xbox I'll for for you. I found a great spot in New Gad where I can jump off one of the buildings and fall 3 stories into a pool of water. Pretty much a guaranteed death, and an easy respawn for you.
---
I didn't know a Tandy 1000 could run this game? 
---
Bit of a curmudgeon, no?
---
Recently just started playing, wouldn't happen to have a picture would ya
---
I'd say about 96% of the time, mine will recover. BUT those are always during Impostor and SBQ events, which is when I would experience these pause/freeze situations *(well not true, originally [an update in Jan or Feb] this happened any time I went to Charleston or anywhere in the vicinity of it, but those were back-to-back pauses of ~20 sec)*. The longest I ever waited was about 30 minutes, where I was here on Reddit making a followup to one of my comments detailing this and.......... it suddenly recovered  lol
---
To my amazement, given it was Sheepsquatch, I was not dead *(again, as it froze on me just as I died that time; probably only made it worse in that instance)* and when it recovered the event details were in Fast-Forward mode. By the look of it, things played out for awhile longer, as it went through quite a few cycles of "Is now vulnerable to attack", before finally completing, awarding me my loot and... best of all... I no t only could still find her scrap pile for my Legendary, but my back of junk was still there! :D 
---
But yea, since this is an "unresponsive program" event, if the freeze happens and you start clicking a lot, or mashing keys, basically that induces the end-task-only scenario. Think of it like a normal Program Window that goes unresponsive... If you click inside it a couple times, eventually Windows steps in and grays out the program saying how "it's unresponsive, would you like to end-task or wait?"; except, in this instance we aren't provided the courtesy of that dialog box.
---
THIS issue, with AID items (or perhaps just "pip-boy" in general, just in case), is a different gremlin entirely, since it seems to be a true crash... yet, not quite. In turn, Windows doesn't know how to handle it, and we're left in limbo. 
---
Don't know how related this may be, but I use the new "alternative" (PA-esque) Pip-Boy menu, instead of the wrist-view. Whether or not anyone else that experiences this, also uses that view, that may be the only correlation between us all. \*shrug\*
---
The starlet sniper hat clips a little, but bc they're similar colors it's less noticable
---
That's what I've got goin rn anyway haha
---
I‚Äôm in this group and no we don‚Äôt leech other players loot. But we can take her down in around 30 seconds if everybody is on board with the protocol.  Saves a lot of ammo and time, because we usually have 3 nukes simultaneously lined up to launch.
---
So the rumors look like they're probably true then, bummer.
---
Maybe one day they'll introduce more mods to preexisting weapons like they did with the assaultron head.
---
# This is the reason why I never accept friend or team invites nowadays
---
Bethesda please fix this
---
wait, so the campfire tails and stings and things.. but what other one?
---
Yesterday I tried to make the Sole Survivor's home in 76.  It didnt work out as well, mainly due to the camp size limit.
---
Buy what?
---
He ded
---
That's the trend nowadays. Pubg, Apex legends, Fotnite, they don't have text chats. Heard game companies were sick of getting involved with people suing others over text chat and having to comply with law encorcements. Not to mention having to deal with ingame reports regarding people shitting out their mouths
---
When I moved my camp it retained all the shop items, but that's probably because the vendor was in my camp on a foundation
---
Excuse me, but it takes all 120 of my vending slots for all my White Wolf Hats üé© and freshly made boiled water üí¶
---
Yea I have trouble doing it solo and I have god tier everything. The problem is when I do it solo it spawns 15 glowing wolves vs. 2 when I‚Äôm in a group! Also at the end there is like 20 bloat flys 2 bears  and 2 sheepsquatch! It‚Äôs a lot to take on tbh. With 2 or more it‚Äôs pretty smooth and it‚Äôs always giving solid plans that re sell great!
---
That's not a thing.
---
Lmao report for playing the game? You can just set your game to pacifist and itd be impossible to enter pvp, dont see how they couldve affected you
---
Nuked 2 times today:)
---
What‚Äôs this about?
---
Postal Worker canvas bag...oooh, so close.
---
I mean, I still use 76 as a free fast travel location if I happen to feel like going anywhere in the forest/toxic valley just out of convenience, but otherwise I agree
---
The nuclear waste collection thing. The 2 dailys show up in the terminal and the campfire event only shows on the map when it's active.
---
Back when slap damage was still a thing I was shopping in the military wing and suddenly started taking damage. I back out, and it's some tool bag wearing the clown mask and grinding on me with a handy blade. I give him the angry emote and try to go back to shopping, but the stagger kicked me out of the menu.
---
I look at him, emote again, and start backing up. I've played enough that I know where all the robots are in the building, so I backed down the stairs to the room with the seek &amp; destroy terminal, and dodged out of the way just in time to watch him hit an assaultron.
---
He was immediately faced raped by a gang of robots and died before he could fast travel or run away. I giggled, grabbed his bag of junk, and went on my merry way with a couple hundred pounds of free materials.
---
That sucks dude
---
I had pacifist on. He/she stalked me throughout the map
---
'Dead drops' - I rate that term. I've been doing the same thing for ages and lost something for the first time today, only 2000 shotguns shells I had been saving and was going to stick in my vending machine but fuuuck if that had been one of my TSEs I would have cried like a baby hahah
---
Yeah, rather than have it for your normal camp, having this as an emergency pop up camp with a few essentials sounds pretty great honestly.
---
wait, wouldn't sharing with friends decrease your chances?  or net zero at best, unless you give more than one entry per share? :D
---
20hrs after your first sale. So if you spend a single cap and 19hrs 55mins later sell 1399 worth of junk you could sell another 1400 worth in the next 5mins..   usually a 10 to 15 min run through of the top of the world ski lodges can get you 1400 worth of stuff if it's spawns with super mutents or mole miners
---
Switch servers?
---
The new one
---
This is a public service announcement because it happened to me
---
Just delete the wire powering it.
---
This game ain't optimized. Turn on your vsync. Even 2080ti won't get you steady 60 fps
---
Huh. Reddit phone app doesn't let me send messages. 
---
On specific issues, Id have to ask. Got out of the game a few years back.  Glad to see coachmen move away from the siding. I actually like they new layout too.

Six months isnt bad. If youve got some miles on it, youll figure out if stuff is starting to shake loose. So standard maintenance. Wash the roof every once in a while. Keep an eye on your front seals, and the roof seals. I recommend vent covers, just because you can leave it cracked a bit and let some of the humidity out when you're not using it. Not a major thing, but helps.  Pretty much outside of that, warranty should cover.
---
You could get a modulator and sound like a Terminator or something cool? 
---
I mean I get not feeling confident. I used to feel the same but my job requires me to hear my own recorded voice at least once a week which desensitized me.  but I'd say hoping on Bethesda to add extra chat is a pipe dream.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure ‚ÄúRight Arms‚Äù plans result in both arms unlocking, it‚Äôs a description bug. One I know for sure happens with ‚ÄúSturdy Robot Armor Right Arm‚Äù which unlocked both arms for me.
---
Oh I feel you with the afk a couple days ago I was getting ready to go to work and someone was actually drinking at my bar so I didnt want to go but 10 minutes later I just yell out last call and log off I kind of feel bad but a man's got to work.
---
Zero behemoths. What am I doing wrong?
---
So they let you clear the silo then you went down I‚Äôm assuming? Then they launched the nuke after you cleared the bots?
---
U might be bugged try unequiping reequiping class freak. With class freak it's not so bad, but I have cannibal aswell.
---
Dude what are you talking about?  Explain what happened and maybe someone can actually help you.  This doesn‚Äôt make any sense.
---
i have them for sale for 659 caps PC shielded BH ones as well as Vault suits
---
It is look it up
---
I have no idea. I wish I could find one. Or get that damn stimpak diffuser plan to FINALLY drop....
---
Laser weapons still arent good. Zero armor piercing, can‚Äôt be silenced so no covert op/mister sandman bonuses, automatic mode lowers their ammo capacity... stil not good.
---
Heavy weapons are amazing though, specifically the ballistics- 50cal, gatling gun, LMG. Minigun is okay; energy HW are decent but again, no armor piercing benefits.
---
So you can't even use the website properly and think I edited or removed my comment? It is still there, and pointing out that reddit is an american website isn't xenophobic. It is an american company and run on american domain. With over 80% of the user base being american.
---
Pointing out facts isn't xenophobic. LOL
---
They've really got so many missed opportunities like this one, to make some extra money in atom shop.. but at the same time I'm glad they're more focused on creating content.
---
Doesn't mean they couldn't be more creative with what they make available though!
---
Context?
---
Some still everything from my account except for my power armor frames and a backpack
---
Ok. Never seen that before with any plans. Thought it was peculiar. Thanks
---
I think there's people who will want it.
---
you seem to know a lot about being an annoying fucktard
---
You really gotta watch when in inventory. Thing jumps around like crazy. Selling to vendors I can select something and suddenly it'll jump to another item.
---
I cleared everything myself and that person walked right behind me . When I went to the silo no one was there.
---
Nah. You're full of it. No verified accounts of anyone having their Bethesda account "hacked".
---
Yeah, I just checked the ESM and you're correct. The sturdy and heavy robot arm plans are misnamed but unlock both arms.
---
Because it‚Äôs fuked up some off us want  to explore and collect stuff just for some deuce bag to come and. Kill you and make you waste hrs collecting
---
How is this even possible?  On PC?  I can literally only see this happening on PC and even then it seems like a stretch.
---
We do have one...if you're PC Master race! 
---
Booooooohahahahahaha
---
I really hope Bethesda puts something like this in for everyone. There are so many possibilities when you've got a ton of perk cards to optimize ever aspect of the game.
---
Seriously,  I dont know how I managed this before I put the mod in...i think i just did good enough instead of optimal for most things. Now...wow, what a difference. Quick loads for maintenance,  PA, rifle, shotgun, heavy, melee,  lock pick/terminal hack, max farming/carry weight. You can get specific as you like and change it with just a couple keystrokes. 
---
.
---
The only way you can make them Wanted is if they picked one of your locks. Even then, with pacifist on you wouldn't be able to hit them, and therefore they wouldn't be able to hit you. They've fixed the issue with workshops showing world PVP, so the only possible answer is that you turned pacifist off at some point and engaged at least one of their group. This would put you into PVP with everyone in their group.
---
You have no idea how much I would love it if Bethesda did this!
---
For Super Mutants, I would say that Intelligence is dramatically lowered.  Strength and Endurance are increased.  Maybe more Carry Weight?  You are confined to using only Super Mutant armor.  You have better control over recoil.  You love to eat meat.  You are completely resistant to radiation, assuming you want to go by lore rules.  Not sure how chems affect Super Mutants so maybe they are half as effective?  Perhaps other Super Mutants become friendly?  And I thought that they are immune to diseases but apparently not because you can find diseased Super Mutants.
---
For Ghouls, definitely a penalty to Charisma.  Lots of people despise Ghouls.  Strength and Endurance would probably take a toll.  You would become fully immune to radiation and it slowly heals you.  The lore conflicts when it comes to needing food and water for sustenance but I would assume you need that stuff.  Maybe it takes you longer to feel negative effects?  I am not sure if they are immune to diseases.  I think average chems barely affect Ghouls so they would probably be half effective for you.  Maybe Feral Ghouls are not hostile towards you?
---
I'll help with that silo run. Ill be on in an hour. Psn neauxbodi
---
useful but people now its 2019 we should know basic fucking maths haha :).
---
I own this game but haven‚Äôt played it. Should I even begin?
---
Who knew, Bethesda reads backwards, that explains.. a lot.
---
There's always at least that one person whos only reason to exist is being jerk, often 2 that work as a team if server has more than 5 players. 
---
(Which is btw something to watch out. Top player takes the kills and his friend sends friend requests for others asking to team up, and when they get your location and the top player who has teamed up has fast traveled  there, they leave the team and kill you. Not to mention destroying your CAMP... I learned about this the hard and painful way)
---
Yep pc also it's not that hard when they have your username all ready
---
We can win...together!  Go to my camp, harvest my giant melons and suckle on my brahmin's milk.  Take yourself back to a place before man meat.  We can overcome cannibalism as a community through massive melons and milk!
---
50% of this humor belongs to you for starting this thread.
---
Also having the repair bobblehead is handy since it gives 30% more duration
---
Make sure you go with dense armor mod at least for chest, it makes all the difference in the world!.. I've got the healing mutation, so I don't worry about limb damage really...
---
If all they released was a battle royal then maybe and also no one knows what all the details are despite some sound files and a German bug. I honestly question how they will make a battle royal in a vault so I guarantee there's a lot to it that people don't know so it's best not to speculate.
---
So you died though? And they took your junk?or did they launch the nuke themselves? But isn‚Äôt a good thing that no one is in the silo so then you could launch the nuke?
---
Where? I've not found a single person even in this subreddit which is VERY forgiving and acts like this game can do no wrong wanting it.
---
Yea that happened to me once too, i finally figured it out what was going on after i died a few times
---
Yep also it not hard when they have your s

Point is I already purchased the plans and was wearing the crafted undrerarmor when I logged off. Now everything for that undrerarmor is gone. This is the last Bethesda game I will be spending money on.
---
marsupial is your friend
---
ill b on tonight bout 6 or 7 i have a few in my vendor for sale if u want
---
Are there people just wandering around with stuff to trade? If I get something worthwhile I‚Äôm either equipping it, stocking my shop, or off to the purveyor stand for scrip.
---
They've already got in game assets that work like you describe.. they've got so many missed opportunities of things they've got already in the game, which would have much more cool factor..
---
Hopefully they pay attention to posts like this one, the community comes up with so many great ideas.. sad if we're all wasting our time!
---
Go back to FO4 !
---
Shoot me a message when you get on and I‚Äôll come buy. It‚Äôs 9 here already haha.
---
You can listen to all 300 voice clips, it clearly is all about the battle royale, about the only different modes there will be is a solo battle royale and a "squad" based battle royale. 
---
Also, you can tell that is all there is because of the german bug as if there was other things they would also be showing up like the battle royale names are.
---
EDIT: Also if you listen to the voice clips, it won't be inside the vault, you'll have to win the battle royale to gain access to parts of the vault. The vault itself won't be where the fighting takes place, it will take place outdoors.
---
Then haw do you explain my account being drained of everything except power armor frames and a backpack
---
Yeaaah that would be a day one purchase.
---
Wow thank you
---
Okay but realistically can you actually explain how this would happen?  Because if this could happen as easily as you‚Äôre making it to be that would mean they‚Äôd have your CC information, personal information, etc.  It seems a bit weird that would happen just to go in and take your inventory.  Not to mention going to the police for hacking into your account?
---
People bitch just to do it these days and Suddenly a small group of people on Twitter becomes the voice of the entire game.
---
I got an ok plasma gun the next time, not really my thing took the 40 scrips. i got 99 scrips right now can find a legendary to save my life not that i'm really looking to hard.
---
server hop  . its to hard for peeps to chase you around different maps unless they have a friend of yours on your friend list ratting you out.
---
Can u switch forest to urban at all does anyone know?
---
Perform a thorough antivirus scan on your computer. You most likely got a keylogger if that happened. Change any passwords you used recently, or just everything in general to be safe. It might suck to lose all your video game gear, but it'll be much worse if somebody can do the same thing to your bank account
---
The duffle kerfuffle
---
haha cool  will do if your not on we will work a time out i can hold them for you
---
The person said later on they misspoke. They meant the burrows. There are tons of bunkers, and while many of them are pertinent to the stories and quests, none of them are really involved in any commonly played events and farm locations.
---
You probably have a shit password, account shated with someone shared shouldn't have, or you are full of it.
---
You can't report people for that lol
---
Why would you report them, for playing the game how it supposed to be? Not everyone is good and there will be riders, but that‚Äôs nothing to report them for. Kill them or let them do whatever they want. They can‚Äôt do anything to you, except launch your nuke if you slow,
---
What level are you?

"High capacity" essentially being the basic one, right?
---
I have always had good with salt maxed out an on, so a fridge backpack would basically give me two perks back... which I would probably put in to Thru Hiker and really double down on some lightweight food!

Also you can report Bethesda to Bethesda for ruining survival servers, so ppl have more rewards from PvP at adventure mode.

I am interested, but I need a lot more info on how this works(not very experienced in online gaming/mmos)

How is it tracked? Do I need to play with other groups other than my own current one? What kind of rewards are we talking about? Is it a full on role playing community(I am not very good/extremely interested at that)?
---
Feel free to PM to answer.
---
One of my buddies, who isnt a fallout fan, calls the game HD minecraft.
---
I heard that even though it says it doesn't stack, someone tested it and it did. Either way, can't trust a glitch/exploit to be around forever. I think I'll build another basic one, run with fridge, switch if I get over encumbered so I can FT back to base, and move my two good with salt perks into something else. Thanks!
---
Ouch
---
Where did you find the flechette mod? I purchased a hunters with explosive secondary. I heard that with flechette is pretty good.
---
I want them to fix the issues with building and make things less restrictive.  I want to build so badly but apparently stairs do not stack and the placement issues are killing it for me.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ Excellent catch
---
All they did was follow him, not even troll, yet he wrote this essay on here lmao
---
That's correct, yes. You wouldn't receive the reload speed bonus but would also not suffer from the increased thirst and hunger.
---
The faster movement while aiming has nothing to do with actually "aiming," making it very misleading.
---
Clyde has been busily dispatching molerats and scorched in his stead. carrying pete's banner with a scowl.
---
If you have a slow firing weapon killing all the weak little fellas can be a pain I agree. How I go about it is I aggro the sasquatch onto me, then kill all the little adds first to protect the cows. On my melee it can be sketchy from time to time, but I've never failed it either. Even if your toon isn't a vats toon, vats really helps kill the little critters that skitter all over the place. It also helps spot them, so get used to using it if you don't.
---
Every toon should be carrying multiple weapons for multiple situations. If all you have is a single shot sniper rifle, you're going to fail. The point isn't having god tier equipment, it's having suitable equipment for the situation. My heavy gunner can clear the event in unmodded lvl 15 power armor with a low lvl non-legendary .50 cal just easy as pie. My rifle toon with a lot stronger gear can 
---
struggle a bit if I don't take down all the bloatflies and what not quickly enough. I haven't really had that problem because with gun fu and a handmade or combat rifle I can cut through 15 weak mobs in seconds.
---
Also you are suffering from Rad Worms
---
The stuff doesn't explain the set up though. How do you do a battle royal in a vault? That's the big question but even then I don't care if they make a, battle royal. It's good to have a balance in content between pve and pvp. Maybe this will actually make me want to do pvp because I don't have to worry about losing caps.
---
&gt;And do it all in survival. It's almost never picked over. Well avoid Uranium Fever in survival but the rest is easier in survival.
---
There's no reason to ignore the events in survival. PvP is disabled when you're in an active event area. You have to be ready to haul ass the moment it ends, but I've done dozens of events in survival with randos and never been killed.
---
Well I can genuinely say i‚Äôm sorry to hear that‚Äôs been your experience. I take Hemlock most nights I‚Äôm on and i‚Äôve really only had people challenge me for it a handful of times. But that doesn‚Äôt discount your experience, Hemlock is much more easily accessible than say the Ammo Factory by fast travel so I could definitely see people fast traveling up to PvP. 
---
  I can say in my own experience almost any player that has come challenge me for the workshop has kept it or just left and not challenged again after they attacked but obviously we‚Äôve had differing experiences, I think the accessibility to take the workshops is necessary to keep players from just sitting on them afk to farm but obviously it does attract some assholes.
---
I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs been your experience.
---
So how would you find out? You can log on your character but all stuff is gone? They didn‚Äôt change the password? Can you see friends list, may find out to whom they traded the stuff or something like this? Sound very unbelievable your story.
---
I strongly suspect that the hover bug is caused by repeatedly staggering the queen in mid-air. At least, when everything stops shooting it does seem to unstick itself within a few seconds.
---
It's an old glitch, but back when the queen was easy to kill, it didn't matter. You'd just kill it in mid-air if necessary.
---
You‚Äôre right, just because it‚Äôs a pvp mode doesn‚Äôt mean people should be absolute dicks at every chance they get. Shooting on sight is such a boring way to play.
---
Yea I use be lever and be handmade and yea vats is a must! I‚Äôll have to give it a try solo tomorrow and see how it goes!
---
Yea screw that. I got my backpack and then that was it. I do the dailies which sometimes give badges so that's good enough for me. If completely the check list got me more than one badge or some cool and interesting loot than maybe but it's a lot of work for one badge.
---
I don't know I just logged in and everything is gone
---
I scrapped my power armor core once left me standing there with 300 pounds of X-10 parts in my inventory miles for no place
---
I want it. There you found someone.
---
legendary armor out performs power armor in the long run but I have to have my jetpacks. jetpacks plus marsupial plus birdbones is to nice for me to leave.

---
My best weapons in my arsonal are level 35 and 40 (bloodied explosive db shotgun lv35, quad exploding harpoon gun lv40) they absolutely wreck anything in their path. You don't need max level to destroy the wasteland, you need a build and I've gotten god drops from Thai event and uranium fevee
---
Oh, ok. Unfortunate...üôÅ
---
if you share it i Will give you one more chance, put your name in the random selector twice, even if there is one more person in the draw you Will have one more chance it means it Will be easier for you to get one of the rewards. Cheers
---
I definitely had a similar experience when I started playing, my friend had a really great build and far outperformed me in damage. I found taking some time to see what kind of play-style I most enjoyed and then tailoring my build with the resources available online really helped me increase the damage I was doing and my survivability. If you‚Äôre not using nukes &amp; dragons‚Äô build manager I would highly recommend it. 
---
This is a weapon damage calculator that you can use to plug in what weapon you‚Äôre using and see what variables will let you put out the most damage in various scenarios as well if that helps.
---

Yeah unfortunately I'd assume if it does stack they dropped the ball. I have Good w/Salt rank 1 on my craft-repair set so it's active while I'm around camp (plus happy camper reducing the overall need). Fridge is definitely ace as I can't afford to run Good w/Salt all the time.
---
Yeah happened to me too. We literally had that bitch and she just went outside the area. Feels bad man
---
Honestly I can‚Äôt say is impossible to do so, on PC may be very easy, just feel strange. Good luck on getting your stuff back.
---
But I'm going to at least give it a chance. Survival mode isn't my thing because the risk is to high. Who knows what all the details are of this. If it's risk free pvp then I'm all for it. Personally I wanted an arena style however I'm still wondering what the map will be if it is in fact a battle royal.
---
Epic fail Bethesda! Ive dealt with bugs, game crashes and duppers but this takes the cake. Uninstall game FOREVER
---
I guess that's fair.

Yeah well.. they should have that listed on the armor instead me having to memorize all of the DR for each type

Okay but you add me first üòÇ

I generally agree, as someone else said, it seems to be a trend now.

The combination isn‚Äôt for the event. The event is just filling up the troughs and defending the animals, which sounds simpler than it is unless enough people who know what they‚Äôre doing are there.

Greetings,

I'm Brian a member of the Escalations Team here with Bethesda Customer Support.
---
I deeply apologize for the delay in getting back to you as continually replying or "bumping" a ticket for a status update only delays our ability to assist. Upon review I am very sorry to inform you that we do not have the ability to restore lost/deleted characters due to tool limitations.

Thank you for your understanding.

Warm regards,

Bethesda Customer Support

My response to them:
---
Brian,
---
This is unacceptable. 
---
1. To blame your company's inability to properly service a paid customer, on the customer, is dispicable.
---
2. I did nothing wrong. I logged in to my game, that I had finished most of the main original quests, after a 2 week hiatus. I found my character completely missing and a level 8 character, that I did not create, in its place.
---
As I stated before, I am a datacenter manager for [Prominic.net](https://Prominic.net). This kind of ineptness would have NEVER happened with my employees. If something like this did happen, the person or persons responsible would have lost their jobs. I hope that you will use this as a training tool and your service will get better. As for me, I will NEVER buy any of your games again. I will also recommend any person that thinks of buying one, to my experience and highly recommend them not to.

Listen to the voice clips, the battle royale won't be inside, the battle royale will be how you get access to vault 51's deeper areas.
---
Same here. Challenge is bugged.
---
That would be appreciated. Thank you!
---
If you are on survival I believe they have every right to do that.
---
Oh they got me too. This is the lowest of the low
---
Thank God for pacifist mode. They really need to make it so a team can't pvp a single player. If you aren't part of a team then it's solo pvp only
---
Lmao, now I want a modulator.
---
So just a single person. LOL When there are posts daily about begging them to add text chat and a bunch of other things. Not to mention the huge thread the other day begging them not to make a battle royale as that will probably kill this game for any new players if it tries to compete in anyway with fortnite.
---
Chem recipes my dude.
---
Whitesprings raid anyone?
---
Workshops and Bog Town
---
Just to say, so far I've found six total mounted plans you can get. The 6th one to your list being a Mounted Firefly.
---
Fought three 80‚Äôs at Whitespring station a couple days ago. Third one drops a prime double barrel receiver plan (first prime plan I had personally seen drop). I was pretty stoked and the game crashes. üòë
---
You can absolutely get badges from the the Pioneer Scout events as others have pointed out.  I did want to add my opinion to some of the points you made.  You appear to be frustrated with some of the challenges.  I have completed all of them with the exception of Collector and anything that was bugged.  Here is a few things I found out to make them easier.  
---
Player vending makes it possible to buy serum plans from other players.  I bought one for 5k and I‚Äôve seen some of the less desirable ones for a low as 3k.
---
Robot armor legs do exist in the game, I have them and completed the badge for crafting them.  They are in the  random armor spawn loot pool.  Check places like Camp Venture/Harper‚Äôs Ferry that have random armor plans spawns in them, or check player vending again.
---
You are correct about deathclaw hides.  I‚Äôve read they can spawn in the super mutant meat bags, but so I haven‚Äôt found any yet.
---
I did the conduit challenge in one Imposter event, you don‚Äôt have to hold it very long.  Bring some stims and take the first aid and field surgeon perk and you won‚Äôt die.
---
There is a static spawn of rabbits outside the Whitesprings service entrance on the hill.  May require server hopping as you said.
---
I agree collector is a pain in the ass.  There are two perks in Perception that help find magazines and bobbles heads,  they are surprisingly useful for this challenge.  Perceptibobble and Panpictograph (something like this)
---
You can complete the Fatman portion of the Atomics challenge by bashing enemies.  I went to the airport and bashed scorch.  This also works for the flamethrower part of the Metalworker challenge.
---
I hope this helps.
---
 Just built a new machine, my eighth one. The first was a Pentium 120. 
---
 This one is a Ryzen 2600, 16G of fast DDR4, an Intel 1T SSD on the top M.2 slot and my old GTX 1070 running video. Its pretty sweet. ;)
---
I won't
---
I hope you got something good.
---
You think everyone that plays the game is on reddit? Battle royals are a popular gene but again I'm not going to jump to conclusions on what this will be without an official announcement.
---
P.A.C.I.F.I.S.T.
---
Where will it be? That's the question that no one can seem to answer as well as all the details on how it will work in its entirety.
---
Had two times in one day where dudes got snippy cause I didnt want to trade. You know, cause I was busy with other sheet. Somehow they were both able pvp me without warning and kill me.
---
It isn't just reddit mocking bethesda for a battle royale, it is youtube, major gaming site, their own forums. Basically anywhere people who play the game communicate is filled with "please for the love of god don't try to make a fortnite 76"
---
And workshops? Gtfo of here.
---
Flares tagging nearby enemies like with recon scopes as well would be a nice little use
---
Hence why servers are empty
---
You can still destroy camps by kiting enemies that spawn from fast travel for one. Second of all, maybe people don't want you in their space regardless of you wanting to see it. Just because you want to do it doesn't override people not wanting to participate in what you want to do ;)
---
You're free to unlock the door and eat a bounty. That's your consequence for curiosity.
---
You cannot scrap plans you have already learned. They stay in your craft lists.
---
I have contemplated doing public and private benches! Now if only I had the camp budget for it...üò≠
---
Yes it is answered in the voice clips, there is over an hour of them. It will be like survival where you start out naked just like in fortnite and then have to scavenge your way to survive. It will take place in Appalachia on a different instance of it like survival vs adventure. You will have Adventure, survival, and battle royale.
---
 I don't think you get much, I sure didn't. ;)
---
If you claiming workshops do it on server that can‚Äôt place your camp. You don‚Äôt need it. Problem solved.
---
Not even a legendary?
---
Stealth unarmed is very low maintenance and great for grinding. With a decent Instigating weapon and chameleon armor you can clear virtually any location easily and quickly without getting hit. Also does great DPS against bosses, especially if you have a bloodied swing speed weapon. Heavy weapons are my choice for ranged.
---
How many other players were there?
---
Every YouTuber I subscribe to such as juicehead and rifle gaming haven't said anything negative about it plus I've never read a negative article on a game site about it either. I'm just saying even if they do release one who cares. People will enjoy it and it's not like that will be the only thing added in the entirety of nuclear winter. Their will be PVE stuff as well. There's lots of people who enjoy the pvp aspect of the game in fact survival mode has a big following and is praised on those gaming sites so i don't see why they wouldn't like this one.
---
That's the point. It shows you're confident and don't give a fuk about giving away your location. Absolutely alpha
---
Admittedly weekend's are the worst but I still got 8 cores in about 30 to 45 minutes. Ash heap area has the highest number of cores.

4; and they were high lvl too, plus me .

 Nope just stuff. I don't even remember what it was. Kinda like the Grafton Monsters list but better. ;)
---
A *35 Executioner's Spear. Nothing glamorous but my melee alt will enjoy it for a bit.
---
Have you read the comments in those videos? ROFL, they are all mocking the hell out of the idea of it being a battle royale.
---
If they release it, people will be even less likely to try the game out, as they will see it as nothing more than a fortnite wannabe that is badly programmed and full of bugs.
---
What they need to be working on is actual bug fixes and fixing their server instability, instead of adding more instability with a third instance of the game world running one for each game type.
---
Lol

Nice we want more hard contemp like this one.

Good luck!

Then how would that even tie into the vault? I've listen to what juicehead has said and he even admits its all speculation until their a concrete announcement. From what I gather you go to the vault and the computer that's in the voice clips has a contest to choose the next overseeing which apparently could be a battle royal.
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more.
---
I feel you bro. I lost a couple of plans and some ammo and 100 screws, a 3* instigating crossbow and couple other fun "survival kit" weapons and chems. That's only what I can remember I was moving over to my rifle build. Im still salty but I'll live, it's just all virtual "stuff". ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Yes please
---
/s because you spelled Bethesda correctly.
---
You're just trying to play devils advocate and you're bad at it.
---
award for longest title goes to
---
It ties into the vault as it is how ZAK is testing the "canidates" for overseer. If you listen to the full voice clips you'd know this.
---
Do you really want me to lay out the entire story for you with the character names and everything? Because I absolutely can after listening to all the clips.
---
maybe an easier way to signal supply drops?
---
You gotta keep feeding those machines. The more you put in, the stronger friendly you'll have to defend.
---
I‚Äôm sorry what‚Äôs that? I‚Äôm just telling you how to protect your camp from bad guys. You have problem with them, I take care of my self not crying on Reddit
---
My Hotrodder PA paint is limited time only.  Again.
---
I wanted you to have the link for the Guerilla, so here it is.  The Gunslinger is the exact same build, simply exchanging the Guerilla for Gunslinger equivalent.

---
I use a variety of handguns, but favor the 10mm for the automatic version.  It seems to net the most attacks per AP consumption.  I also carry an  assortment of .44's, a .45 pipe, a .38 pipe, and a plasma gun.  
---
Play tactics:  (1)Make sure you find a harmless critter to set your VATS to 'head' every time you login to play.  This will alleviate you needing to roll up or down on the wheel on the fly.  (2)Hold space bar down in VATS, always.  This will assure your critical's fire as they become available.  (3) Carry many guns, you will go through them in long fights.  Repairs are a way-of-life.  (4) You are only more deadly as you kill (adrenaline, tenderizer, Gun-fu etc.), so if your in a kill streak, keep it up!
---
Is this a crossover episode
---
This. I think even squirrels and cats count.
---
Ehh just dont atk him back. Not like he would drop anything good anyway. Just think of lowbees as a toddler kicking you in the ankles. Sure you could punt the little brat but that won't help anyone
---
No one is crying. Just pointing out an exploit to Bethesda.
---
Social engineering is not hacking.
---
can you still put bases on the golf course? I thought I read that they arent possible anymore...
---
Most of the time something gets "hacked" it's because the owner had a relatively easy to figure out password...and someone figured it out.
---
It‚Äôs not exploit, it‚Äôs game mechanics and they already nerfed a lot because of ppl like you and guess what, it didn‚Äôt help the game.
---
While what you say is absolutely true, I think it's important to respect what the other players want to do as well, especially if they arrived at the event before you.  I've seen this event become surprisingly hostile, with players yelling and stabbing at those who play the instruments or keep the jukebox going.
---
Not everyone is interested in your personal meta for maximizing Legendary returns.  Not everyone is interested in standing around for 25 minutes farming an incredibly boring event.  It would be nice, but realize that this is akin to saying "Don't kill the SBQ!  We have 30 minutes to farm the adds!"  Don't get ticked off when no one goes along with your demands.
---
Hey Jim. So I've been running around trying to tame things and I think it might be broken. Can get a rad toad pretty consistently but neither animal friend or wasteland whisper gives the tame option for the deathclaw I found that should have been tameable. Let me know if you find one that works. Pretty disappointed honestly
---
Whatever build you want. I personally use vanguards combat armor for the +35 resistance per piece while full health.
---
Put them in a room you can lock the doors to.
---
I've listened to some of the tapes. I know the story but from what I heard you can't exactly say what the entirety of the game mode is. You can speculate. Anyways I don't really care. Not all players are pve players so it would be selfish to not give pvp players any new content. If you don't like pvp then don't play it. Theres suppose to be plenty of pve content on the way such as the vault raid which sound pretty dope because they are instanced. So one of the vaults will be that at least so that pve players get something as well. Personally what I want more of are daily quest. Right now that's pretty much all I do are the dailies and occasional event such as scorched Beast Queen so more dailies will make my daily sessions longer than just a couple of hours. I imagine that's coming though because gave us the terminal to keep track of dailies now they just need to add more to the list than the three that are on there.
---
yes.
---
I run bloodied except for SBQ, melee bloodied mole miner gauntlet with 40% swing speed. Heavy guns i run tse laser gatling, or vamp 50% limb damage. I have a couple bloodied shotguns but melee and heavy guns work better for me. I am my own worst enemy though.
---
Thanks. I'll look around there. I was focused inside the city.
---
I've seen a single post about this. In the last hour. Nothing else, and I live on this subreddit during the day at work.
---
As the other poster stated; easy password = not secure and can be brute forced.
---
There was another post earlier in the day about a guy looking for Bethesda support because his account had been hacked also but they never responded to his ticket.
---
The shocks are 5 violet flux each, plus some common materials (mostly aluminium and adhesive, I think). Stealth Boy is 5 fluorescent flux, adhesive and aluminium again, plus fiber optics, circuitry and gold. 
---
Other than the flux, the exact quantities are a bit tricky to look up, but 15 of each per component is in the right ballpark, IIRC.
---
Dude if I could become a wendigo, even just for a pvp event I would be stoked. Make it so the roar stumbles you like someone broke your block, and make them fast and hsrd to hit damn I'd have fun!
---
There‚Äôs like 3 bases around me on the golf course. Your base just can‚Äôt be to close to whitespring. It‚Äôs not just the golf course I tried other places as well.
---
i really dont know.  never had the problem.  i hope someone else does.
---
Well-written!
---
Ah, just found it in search. I'd still say it isn't a "thing" in terms of an actual data leak on Bethesda's end, rather just insecure passwords and extremely accessible usernames to Bethnet accounts.
---
It comes with the Stalker outfit.
---
No trampling the flowers
---
Dang, I've beaten it a couple times but its probably because there were like 8-10 people running around. They really need to explain it better and put out a server wide notification.
---
But aren‚Äôt the accounts tied with an email not just the username?
---
ugh yeah I hate that shit.  its annoying as hell, immature as shit, and stupid as fuck.
---
My friends death claw is named Marquiese
---
Daddy's got a new Tesla rifle. Daddy now also has the whitespring aggro ...
---
I have 5 pieces of food drink chem reduce armor
---
I carry farrrrr too much aid, lol
---
Seems like consoles are always a bit more stable during updates.
---
Yeah I can get basic stuff like the rad road and radstag etc and found a Mirelurk king, but everytime I find a deathclaw it doesn‚Äôt give me the option, but they are usually being attacked by two mr gutsys or something so again not sure if it‚Äôs the right encounter, or it could be bugged now with certain animals
---
Dude, your entire comment history is negative things about 76. I'm sensing a shill.
---
I can recommend using a plasma flamer instead. Its a plasma gun with a flamer barrel. Its cheaper making ammo for, it uses ammo slower than a normal flamer, it shoots a cool green flame, and have high dps. I have been using one since it dropped for me during an enclave event.
---
Looks like Appalachia is being rebuilt by POORS.
---
Not sold a single Fine Ware but I'm constantly re-stocking my Free Stuff for Poor People vendor.
---
Least they died normally. I lost Mr Cuddlesworth (Deathclaw) to an AI bug, Mitty (Megasloth) to her falling through the map then falling to her death, and Yogi (Yao gui) to...I still don't know he just disappeared. So welcome him to the "Dead Pets Club" for me.
---
The PVP already got new content, they got all of survival mode. How about instead they actually fix the rampant duping that is back, the invulnerable enemies that are back, the constant crashing half the player base gets trying to enter arktos new dungeon. 
---
How about instead of wasting time on stuff the majority of the player base doesn't want and won't bring new people to the game, they work on stuff that actually will bring life back to the game, as if you've not noticed this game hasn't had the best launch or life so far and many many people have quit the game due to these issues.
---
Also, just message me on PSN. I'm doing homework, but have my playstation on.
---
You can log into both F76 and the Bethnet launcher using only the username/password.  It gets more complicated if you attempt to change the password on someone since you need to know their security question answer to change the password and/or email.
---
So, in the case of the most recent person where they made the claim they logged in to having all their stuff deleted, an email wasn't needed at all.
---
Feel free to drop me your PSN and i'll add you. I'm on a lot. Doing school from home so I have a lot of time.
---
I had to annihilate a ton of stuff in my house just to make a [simple sign](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/114735378392416265/583094984094253057/unknown.png) and it'll now be max'd out forever.
---
I still haven't come across anyone to revive. In the meantime, I am ticking off other additional badges at the entry level. Sounds like it is going to be months before I manage a refrigerated backpack. LOL.
---
I would love one of these
---
Thank you! I get mixed up a lot when I type so it took some effort just to get that done. I'm glad you enjoyed it. :)
---
Are you using Wasteland Whisperer? They changed which perk you need to use.
---
Have to complete the tadpole quest
---
It‚Äôs Evil McEvil. Sorry I know it‚Äôs silly. I‚Äôm another victim of a stupid name I came up with when I was a teenager
---
Today I fed a machine continuously, yet all I got was a tiny level 22 tick. There were literally meat piles from dead deers everywhere. Is it all RNG or is there a way to get a better animal to protect? (Still beat the sheepsquatch when the poor little tick had maybe 2% hp left)
---
Interesting.  I guess I‚Äôm just confused as to why this would happen in the first place.  Unless that person was being watched by another player?  Liked what they had, etc?  Isn‚Äôt this kind of illegal lol.
---
Get some cheap under $10 ear buds w/built in mic and plug into ps4 controller. That's what I use and the game sounds great; you clearly hear who or whatever runs near you and the scorch/super mutants' last breaths when you kill them is awesome.
---
That might be complementing fallout we have to make Bethesda want to give us a new engine or highly update this one
---
Maybe stop emoting?
---
Why don‚Äôt you just use the discord? A lot more people will see that over the 20-30 that will come to your camp during a play session
---
I am sorry that happened to you. However, unless you can say with 100% certainty that was the only cause and others can replicate it then it's merely a guess.
---
If you're on PC I'll be on in about 15 minutes after I wrap up some work stuff. IGN WarmYourBeans. We can go kick the hornet's nest.
---
No clue.  I would start by updating video drivers.  Also, I assume they only show up in Fallout76 and no other games?
---
I guess the people have spoken and don‚Äôt want it.
---
Fell for it once, shame on me. Fell for it twice, shame on me again. Sees a person with a bounty now? "Go f\*\*k yourself, I'm not killing you".
---
Me: Deposit all meat into grinder things and summon lvl 100 boss.
---
Game: Disconnects from server immediately after.
---
I don't yell at or stab at anyone because I'm not two years old. I'm not mad at anyone either. I do respect other players and help many. But I'd rather play something for 15 mins and get 20 legendaries than play it for 5 and get one.  The entire point of the vid, which I agree with because it works in consistent practice, is that if you're going to do the event, not to rush it and play it this way given it spawns lots of mobs whereas most other events do not.  You're paying the caps to go there. You should get bang for your buck. However, if someone is already there then yes I will respect them. It's just going to have one legendary versus dozens.
---
I can totally vouch for this 110%
---
I do not like partying up, I love my own company, and although I‚Äôm supposed be rebuilding Appalachia I absolutely want to be doing it alone. If I‚Äôm surviving in a god awful wasteland at least let me ignore my neighbors attempts at communication in 76, let alone real life.
---
I would buy one of these.
---
It's man vs. machine bro. which side are you on?
---
Haha.. that's good
---
Are you talking pokemon go raid sized pokemon ahaha
---
It's an exploit, just like stacking bobbleheads was. It isnt working as intended.
---
I was able to tame one with wasteland whisperer and animal friend equipped. I tried with only using one or the other, but it didn‚Äôt work for me. I picked him up just north of North of Thunder Mountain Power Plant on 65. Helped my friend find one in the same spot as well after only a few hops.
---
That's what I do and that's why I see no reason a lvl 20 should be requesting me to trade with them. I don't even know if there's an exploit in trades anymore but I won't accept the offer regardless.
---
I cant... I'm addicted
---
There‚Äôs 3 different power plants that all you have to do is take their workshop and plop down your own fusion generator. 
---
There‚Äôs several perks for fusion cores.
---
What is your time like in a nuke zone? I don‚Äôt burn fusion cores at anywhere CLOSE to that rate. What is your combat technique? Power attacks, VATS, and jetpacks all burn fusion cores *very* fast.
---
Did the someone say Cortana turn off xbox because there's no way someone using a mic could cause  a crash thats ridiculous.
---
Your emotes bring warmth and happiness to the game. And the game recognizes this and wants to share it with the server. Embrace it.
---
How about a posting that says‚Äùso and so attacked your base I say we get the m@&amp;*%^%+!¬£‚Ç¨r‚Äù
---
Your penance:  the very next nuke alert you MUST immediately fast travel to the closest point to the target zone, and run into it.   The closer to the center the better.   All will be forgiven when you are obliterated by holy fire.  No, you can‚Äôt stash your junk before high-tailing it to your doom.
---
Then you might need professional help. At least tell us what emote you're using.
---
Bundle is limited time. But the paint itself ain't
---
Sh*t that‚Äôs just terrible. How do you know it was the mic thought? I ran into self-appointed commanders quite often in boss fights, never had a crash because of their using mics. The crash was often caused by moving too fast into a complex scene. (PS4)
---
Should have seen how it used to be done back in the day on diablo 2. You'd create a private game, sit your character with the items you want to transfer, wait 5 minutes in game. Leave the game and rejoin to see if it has saved and is being kept live on the server, did it let you rejoin? Cool, hurry up drop everything you want to mule, then log out super fast and then hop on the mule, and then log back into the empty game with the items you wanted to mule.
---
You had maybe 30 seconds to 2 minutes before the servers would realize no one was in the game a close it thus deleting all the stuff.
---
Was always adrenaline packed solo muling, ended up buying an extra cd-key just to self mule with both characters in the same game.
---
I have yet to complete the event, and now I never see people doing it, so I‚Äôm starting to think I won‚Äôt ever get to. üò´ (Xbox)
---
Same for me. I've never once traded with another player. There's nothing you have that I need, and nothing I have you want. If there was, it would be in my vendor, and vice verse. I don't even know how the trading interface works.
---
It would be illegal, yes. It's technically unauthorized access to the account.
---
I'm going *purely hypothetical* with this, but we'll stick with that most recent post of logging in to items deleted. An individual that had this happen to them (just item deletion) is likely a malicious counter-attack by someone whom was pissed off by the individual.
---
They already have their username, and it's not too difficult to use software to brute force a password using a dictionary to try multiple passwords in hopes that it was something simple.
---
Alternative scenario would be the individual has a keylogger on their computer and the "attacker" gained access by simply seeing their password in plain text. This scenario makes a lot less sense than the above just given the fact that grieving someone's account would be pretty low priority for the usage.
---
Lastly; they could have shared their account info with a friend/relative and it bit them in the ass.
---
I was making a wry joke.
---
Finger banging
---
I‚Äôm a moderator for an 18+ mainly rp discord, but we have plenty of people that are on fallout about every night. We usually love when content comes out and post a lot. A lot of people also enjoy other games. I‚Äôll send an invite over PMs if you‚Äôre interested
---
I had absolutely no Idea that the Ever Upwards challenges could be found underneath the ‚ÄúWorld‚Äù tab in the challenges menu. No idea at all. That to me is dumb! 
---
I get that the emphasis is exploration but some missions are totally impossible without googling.
---
I just had the same thing happen to a legend mutant... kill em.. then he started whining up like a robot then BOOM.. I was to find the body though
---
Ha jokes on you I never have any good junk on me
---
The only time I‚Äôve ever been booted is for server maintenance or because my WiFi craps out. Is disconnecting a big problem for people?
---
Bravo!
---
I have to admit when I finally went for the loot I was saddened, but being used to getting legendary canes it wasn't too terrible. At least my alt can use the drop for a time (unless he gets something better along the way then it's just scrip). Thankfully the experience made it easier to accept the lackluster rewards. It would be nice to be able to mount the skull on my wall at least.
---
&gt; Finger banging 
---
LMAO that choice of words. Well done. You Finger bang all you want then.
---
I'd put up with ALL the bugs and bad graphics JUST LIKE WE DID WITH FALLOUT 4 if there were only QUESTS AND A STORY and THINGS TO DO in the freakin game. There still isn't ANYTHING to do in the game, but talk to a quest giving robot or read a note, then go to another spot, click e on a few things and talk to another robot, or read another freakin note. I can't beleive they made a WHOLE game out of 3rd tier FETCH QUESTS. These people DON'T take pride in their work, they don't play their own game in their free time, and they don't like the players.
---
Ohhh that's good to now thanks dude. I love green so it should fit
---
Your post had nothing to do with what the Op posted.
---
Think possible I have some have to check when I log in
---
I play this event for the chance at raider armor plans. I‚Äôm not really interested in dragging it out.
---
Thank you!
---
90% of my posts are content suggestions. You're full of shit.
---
Turn it on and find out.
---
Bloodied and adrenal continue scaling all the way down to about 5% health.
---
By not having text chat they are going to be breaking the law very soon in the EU as it is basically shitting on the deaf.
---
I feel it‚Äôs a good game. I suggest you try it out and get a feel for yourself.  I suggest starting in adventure mode.  
---
They have added a lot of content that has been mixed but I like it.
---
I'd have to delete some things to make room for it so I'd rather not just delete a bunch of shit then have to redownload them.
---
Maybe it's a way to put a small marker on the map and possibly inform other vault dwellers that somebody is in distress? The best thing about that is that you just don't know who will respond to the call for help...
---
Game is a lot better then it was still has issues and they need to still add more to the main storie line cause it just ends when U find all the tapes
---
10/10 story telling. Please regale us with more of your misadventures in Appalachia.
---
&gt; big fucking violet dildo 
---
 Embrace it! Spread it across Appalachia. Start a gang with everyone having violet dildos on their shotguns. You'll be the most fear/popular gang in Appalachia.
---
I wouldn't lower stats per se but give a buff/debuff. Maybe +6 strength +2 endurance, -4 int, -4 per and cha for SM. +4 endurance, -4 charisma and -4 int on ghouls.
---
Pull in the SM armor from FO4, or make other armor scale with a mod or paint. Neither can get most mutations, but all SM have twisted muscles, healing factor and scaly skin. Ghouls get carnivore, isotope and talons. Maybe ghouls can pick up plague walker. Both have rad immunity. Ghouls get ghoulish 3 for free. SM get stabilized 3, but without PA requirement, and strong back 3. SM cant sprint. SM get a additional stagger and limb damage chance on two handed weapons.
---
Healing from rads is huge if paired with no rad damage. That would need a hard look for balance. And no rad damage on SM would also be quite strong. The above is just off top of my head.
---
Thanks. 
---
My frustration with having absolutely no indication of this just gives me hope that Bethesda ‚Äúelaborates‚Äù somewhat on quests in the future.
---
No joke.  You must purge your sins and be cleansed by the holy fire.  Only then will all be forgiven, praise Atom!
---
Edited.
---
I literally unequipped this perk just for that reason, I was eating a corpse every five seconds
---
Are they running any mods? It might be the mods causing it rather than the game.
---
I have the same issue too but I've just attributed to one of the mods I'm running.
---
How did you get a new quest from him? Did you finish all the badges for pioneer scouts?
---
Can you buy a larger hard drive for a PS4?
---
Wouldn't regular letters only have 2-6 polygons?
---
Yeah I can I've looked into just haven't gotten around to it.
---
pipe pistols are actually decent drops. I killed the queen today and got a one star nocturnal pole hook. A level 100 alpha sheepsquatch at Paradise event gave me a ghoul slayer (or mutant slayer, don‚Äôt remember for sure) wood leg.
---
 I‚Äôve tried doing that multiple times and each time it ended in failure. The way the scaling works on the queen means anybody who is coming in solo without coordination is actually making things harder. Given I also don‚Äôt use power armor and I have to fight in the middle of a radioactive war zone for most attempts, I eventually gave up on it.
---
Yeah I have adrenal. It‚Äôs just weird that I don‚Äôt gain or lose health and it yo-yos like crazy.
---
With Colonel Mustard in the Study
---
I DC'd  4 times last night, in about 40 minutes, while building my camp. This was on ps4
---
It says in the description that is is a skin.
---
They used to fall under Animal Friend as well as Wasteland Whisperer, but now only WW works. So far as I've been able to figure out, anyway.
---
I pretty much never use PA, but do for the sbq. I always hop in solo, and we kill her probably 9/10 times or more.
---
Make sure you read the patch updates and what‚Äôs new, if you don‚Äôt play every day. You can look on their website :)
---
Adrenaline perk?
---
Some users have reported that the damage numbers in the Pip-Boy don't appear accurate until they manually select the weapon there.
---
&gt;Ps.Friend me on ps4 my Reddit username is my gamer tag
---
Why would I friend you? You will just nuke my pet mirelurk hunter, peter.
---
Run around and go up the stairs. Promise it works. Watched two of my comrades use this method with much success.
---
I just builded my latest camp around there, against a cliff, and this was my first time seen a behemoth in 76. My first ever behemoth was in FO3 in some quest when going to meet the radio dude, i think. But the one that frightened me the most (on first encounter) was the Swan in FO4. But thoses never frighten me as much as when i stumble apon a mirelurk queen ; that yelling ! Get me everytime...

---
I just hit R3 (PS4) and viewed it. It goes from super high damage to crazy low for me to be in nerd rage and on a team
---
Oh no I don‚Äôt have adrenaline
---
I totally want that. Or any other excuse to use the shag carpet.
---
Well, did you enjoy FO4? If you enjoyed the mechanics, and to a lesser point, building, then you'll probably enjoy yourself. It's hard to gauge another person's reaction to '76. It is extremely fun to play with friends.
---
Sorry that happened, but I've been in numerous that had people talking and no one seemed to crash, it seems like you were just dropped from the server.
---
I enjoyed FO4 and the building but none of my friends wanna touch the game cause of the bad press.
---
I also had moved my camp there! Sadly I had to move it after a couple days because it kept getting destroyed too. Damn scorchbeasts
---
I didn't know you could use emojis on reddit üòµüòµ
---
use the same weapon, crafting ammo for it takes forever since its √ó12 bullets for 8 lead.  I do a tour of player camps and buy all their 308 ammo, most people sell it a cap a piece.
---
I‚Äôm getting this upon attempting to enter the final fire breather exam. I want to complete this quest line!!
---
Every once in a while, but not half as much as when I first started.
---
Are they separate items though? As in, can you wear the bandana on its own?
---
Bloodied does, yes. Adrenal Reaction only scales down to 20%.
---
It was the last thing to pop up right at the moment of a crash in between wave 2 and 3. No other changes to the game at the current time.
---
The Wendigo actually got nerfed sometime around Patch 9.  It used to be an actual 3\* enemy before then, and so regardless of adds, One Violent Night was one of the rare Events where you could reliably get a 3\* to show up.
---
Couldn't have that, oh no.  I think this leaves AWOL Armaments as the only common Event now with a reliable 3\* enemy, provided it doesn't blow up in your face.
---
The Jukebox also gets messed up if players arrive while it is currently playing, because they actually won't hear it, so they often try to turn it on and end up turning it off instead.
---
But communication is important üòî
---
I am on PC and we did not hear what the person said it popped up and we crashed. I have heard about this issue the day project paradise launched before even playing it. From Juicehead I believe.
---
Maybe you'll bring them in, after you've had a chance to form your own opinion.
---
Idk. I have 3 characters that o recreated identical bases with. One I could put it down, the others I couldn't. I originally thought it was because my fusion generator hung over an edge but I still have the same issue after remedying that. Maybe it's because of the conduits. Or now I'm wondering if it's because of separate pieces. Like my base is stored as a separate piece from my purifier. Next time I move I'm putting down my purifier first and then seeimg of I can put down my base.
---
On PC and were in between wave 2 and 3 no issues up to that point not even lag. The mic icon popped up and we crashed as soon as it popped up.
---
You can only get robot armor plans from world spawns. This is a really good resource:

---
You're looking for the white diamonds on the armor and recipes map. Mire and Savage Divide spawns have the highest chance for robot armor plans, I think.
---
I have 3 characters atm one is rifles one is melee and one is heavy gun (level 80 75 and 154) I would encourage a stealth bloody build for rifles (melee is always easy if you struggle but I find it to be boring) and my personal favorite is heavy guns, you throw a lot of lead down range but seeing shit melt from the guns is so satisfying. All 3 of these do great damage as long as you focus on the correct perks (everything that pertains to rifles, as an example rifleman expert rifleman, master rifleman, tankkiller etc.) I would suggest bloody mess, and the perks in luck that affect mutations (class freak and I can't remember the name of the other) and use mutations to supplement your build. As long as you focus on a certain group of weapons and are willing to use mutations /aquire the right legendarys any spec can and will do great, but if you branch out to a lot of different things instead of focusing on one you're going to have a hard time. With all that said, to recap any spec works if you put the effort into making it work, so do what you find funnest
---
Lol. I think I added you. You should be able to change your name now. With consequences anyways. I don't remember how I did mine though.
---
I made the same mistake. I scouted all over for cool spots near lead deposits. Found this really cool plateau that was soonest exactly the size of a camp and the only way to get to it was a stone archway from a cliff. Started building, logged off for the night, spent all day thinking about how I was going to build my awesome castle, came home, logged back in to realize the horrible mistake.
---
The game froze just as soon as the mic icon popped up.
---
Don't hack the player, hack the game.
---
It is when people are not doing the objectives for the event, but everyone was on point during this one
---
Thanks that means a lot to me. My encounters with cryptids and high level monsters have been my favorite part of the game so far. They all tend to terrify and mystify me at the same time.
---
My first encounter with the Mothman at level 14 sold me on the game completely. I could also share my post-Sheepsquatch Scorchbeast attempt that ended pretty much as you'd expect.
---
No, from what I understand, the type and level of friendly animal you get is supoosed to be based on how high of level you can get the machines.  Probably broken like everything else.
---
Could be worse. I had a 3 star legendary drop a clipboard in the burrows today. I‚Äôd be great to have a curl up in a ball and cry animation for times like that.
---
Yes. You get the Stalker Bandana and Goggles both separate, as well as the Prepper Trapper outfit :)
---
I have never been booted. Bethesda‚Äôs servers are more stable than GTA‚Äôs.
---
Fun times. You bust your butt protecting the friendly while evryone else is running around doing jack. Then the Alfa shows up and you have a LV 3 ledgendary pop up in your face. Burning desire to kill the ledgendary then hit the Alfa. Bad choose. Ledgendary downs you and no one cares to help your bloody corpse is screeming for help but no one still cares. So you give up, they spawn you outside. You race your way down and and an Assaultron get in your face. Dead again. Rinse and repeat. Third times a charm right? Nope. Event over and because of load screen going down the elevator you had no clue. So what so you do now. You hunt down the Assaultron.
---
There's a radroach behind the lvl 2 locked door inside Dolly Sods building.  Or you can Marsupial jump over the wall, kill the roach for meat, and jump back without swapping perks.
---
Awesome I look forward to teaming up. I‚Äôm getting the next week off work so we can Nuka the crap outta the map
---
Thanks for the info its interesting to say the least. Squad related stuff I dont mind as I always prefer a group working together over Free For All.
---
Aye switched between wasteland and animal. Wasteland gave me the pacify option but not tame. Animal friend didn't seem to effect it at all
---
Roaming responder bot sells it, I bought myself a set.  Haven‚Äôt seen it anywhere but there.
---
Unless the creature is a random spawn you can't tame it.
---
Walmart
---
I do buy hella water lol.
---
You can crit outside of VATS.  I do it regularly.  Just press Triangle (PS4) when you melee swing and it'll register.
---
thats not..... oh never mind
---
Yeah the only place you can get it is the responder vendor that randomly spawns.
---
The mic icon might have coincided with something else, such as server connection interruption (or your ISP/router), which was the real cause of the crash. Voice itself takes up only a tiny bandwidth and shouldn‚Äôt crash both of your systems simultaneously.
---
Just get all the heavy gun perks, demolition expert perk, increased explosive blast radius perk and bloody mess perk
---
Yes sadly only have one otherwise would put it up for sale. Think I got it while looking for the hunters long coat. caved in after a week and bought it.
---
i support this big time... swimsuit is not armor
---
Ha ha ha, got wrecked fam üí•
---
Leave the vault?
---
Thank you, guy. My demo expert is at 5*, so the rest shouldn't take too terribly long.
---
If you don't play the jukebox, doesn't the scroll bar go in reverse? I thought you had to play the jukebox or some instrument occasionally just to get the scroll bar to the end.
---
I wish you could atleast reset some atom challenges when rolling a new character but meh you need another account for that.
---
It‚Äôs fine as a solo player. If you like FO4, I imagine you would like this.
---
It's the only way to communicate in game other than voice chat
---
Me and my explosive junkie's MLG agree with you :D
---
300 something hours and I've never seen a Behemoth.
---
Correlation does not equal causation. I‚Äôve done this event dozens of times now. My mic is always on, others‚Äô mics are always on. It crashes a lot‚Äîbut that doesn‚Äôt appear to be the cause. 
---
It sounds like you experienced a crash, one of many. The mic was almost certainly a coincidence. Communication is key for this event, so unless you have concrete evidence that talking on a mic was the cause, this is probably doing more harm than good.
---
Looks like they just fixed it.
---
Guess I‚Äôm just gonna wait till they fix it to place my base down. I‚Äôll comeback to the game once they do. It frustrates me so much that I put so much time and effort into my base and I can‚Äôt place it down. I‚Äôve never been so mad at a game till now.
---
Thanks, hopefully the level of the friendlies is not directly proportional to the feeder. I don‚Äôt think I can ever get 3x the amount I got today to make it a level 60 friendly üò≠

---
A quick google search gave me this answer: 
---
How to get Ranger Outfit Clean
---
You can find this outfit in  Alpha River Cabins in one of the cabins, or Shack by the Curator in Prickett‚Äôs Fort, look under the cash register
---
I sell only true Armor lv3 unless it unyeilding armor I sell all levels. As for my weopons most are LV 2 or 3. Even though not everyone buys I don't want them to feel like it was a waste.
---
The animals on the map are just flavor, there's nothing actually at any of them
---
Contractor plus Bog Town
---
Don't forget Stabilizer perk.
---
That‚Äôs what I figured, that‚Äôs a shame though they could easily do some sort of big boss fight with each animal at those locations
---
Gaming addiction will be a recognized disability by 2020, you'll be okay!
---
For real though, when the game first came out I put in enough hours to have similiar experiences/thought processes of sometimes not sorting out the game from the real world. I kinda use that as my "alright, enough games for a bit" signal.
---
I've completed it, but I had a team of four and a handful of unknowns running around.
---
Is it equipped? I know bloody weapons will not show their damage properly unless there is a bloody weapon equipped
---
PC
---
Yeah I do it all the time. I thought I saw a deathclaw arm on the highway the other day but it ended up being a piece of a tire..
---
damn i have like 3  of the plans in my vending machine right now but im on xbox
---
When it comes to bounties, I wait until their bounty exceeds the amount of caps that I would loose on dying! Quite often, a bounty is worth less than killing a player who doesn't have a bounty on their head!
---
Yeah, found this awhile back - remember the typo - they have to mean Alpine River Cabins, instead of Alpha, but no luck at either of those spots either.
---
if you just built your computer get 76 for it. fo4 was terrible on ps4 so I decided never getting their titles on console again.
---
Unpopular opinion but I dont believe they need to keep new players in mind. The game has been out for a while now and I'm happy the content they added has been for late game players because there wasnt much before. Focus on the main quests, do the nukashine stuff, then worry about the new content that's dropped. No use adding content for low level players because when they get to 50 they'll just complain there's nothing to do.
---
Darn thank you anyway.
---
Oh I'm down to help you level if you need it.   I'll be off work in an hour then I'll accept your request
---
We're in the same spot üòÅ
---
He explains that in three vid, yes. Let the music play til first howl then shut off. When it reverses as you say or degrades as he says turn it on for a few.  Then shut off. Around 15 mins turn on til it gets to second howl. Ten mins third. We got it to 3mins left turned and left it on and them murdered the wendigo..
---
Over 200 mobs. Over 20 legs.
---
Hell yea I got adrenaline just reading that.
---
You can get the plans to build them all
---
Take my upvote, sir. I applaud you.
---
Like every video game is litally shitting on blind people by forcing them to keep their eyes on the monitor
---
There's a cap of like 11 or 15 or something.
---
I don't sell them, but I buy a couple every time  I find them for less than 10 caps.
---
I didn't know that about the sound.  Thank you for educating me. I'll keep that in mind.
---
Repair costs are pretty moot. Use White Knight to repair when you need to, or just use the improved repair kits that seem to drop everywhere now. I managed to collect almost 80 in one day.
---
You can hit 15 special max with points.
---
I heard Xbox players have this thing happening always. I can imagine i would need crowfunding for TV too, after such a great experience of gaming :D
---
There are plans to build them all
---
Not new just solo, I'm lvl 100. I don't think that's an unpopular opinion, in fact it's quite logical.
---
It would be dope if it was a mini C.A.M.P.
---
It would make the world even more filled up
---
i once dreamed i found a 5 star weapon...
---
i dream about my fallout friends, and some of them i have no idea what they look like in real life...
---
Aye but the grind to get them all is INSANE. I personally would like new PA types that give special advantages, like how the excavator gives carry weight and extra ore.
---
How much would you buy antibiotics for?
---
Uhm. So I totally read title as new not solo.. not sure if I have some type of dyslexia I just found out about. Kind of worrying..
---
gamertag?
---
yeah I got those too since one of the last updates so does a buddy of mine
---
As someone who does this daily to farm cores, the real challenge is going down into the mall and picking a fight. Far more robots plus those little ball turrets.
---
Yea I assumed it meant they were more prevalent for hunting, but nope just random icons that confuse people for no reason.
---
Yep, don‚Äôt leave c.a.m.p. Without it
---
I hate to say it, but you're probably going to have to "break" the stored camp and rebuild it from the individual pieces.
---
Where'd you find them? I only found mods to add to the chasis. I was thinking of trying to get suits like the Excavator added that were all one piece. 
---
Thank you for your quick reply
---
A mode where everybody spawns notmal, ghouls spawn and if you dont mind your rads you turn into a ghoul. Last man standing wins.

Maybe just distracted or something, it happens.

I‚Äôm a recovering addict for a few years now and I still have ‚Äúuser‚Äù dreams where I‚Äôm getting high and it feels SO real it‚Äôs crazy. (Or I should say trying to get high, I never seem to ever achieve a buzz in my dream lol) Anyways, I have dreams that I‚Äôm doing something totally badass in fallout! Like killed my sbq or building a badass house or something. Then I wake up let down that im not playing! I obviously have an addictive personality so if it was up to me I would play for 19 3/4 hours, drop a deuce and shower for an hour total (possibly 45 minutes but 15 minute window Incase I gotta rub one out or something or use the other 15 from fo76 for a combined 30 for sex if I‚Äôm lucky that night) then eat for a 1/2 hour and sleep solid for the remaining 2 and half hours or whatever the remainder would be. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Never really thought about it. Most diseases like rad worms I just live with until they pass, or I drink from the healing fountain if I'm at WS. The only time I use the cure is if I get something like flap limb that actually effs up my build.
---
I lost one of my characters to some kind of corruption, I though no big whoop, reinstalled the game and started a new character after deleting the old one. Lost my fashnacht items forever. Or at least until next year if the game still exists and they do the same event. I don't understand how they thought world items shouldn't be shared across the account.
---

---
I buy them for 30 and below. I have caps on several characters though. Antibiotics maybe 40 and below.
---
that's pretty awesome!!  well played!
---
Nty I‚Äôve already had to do it way to many times already. They either need to fix it or tell the players how to avoid this from happening. I‚Äôm gonna play other games till they do.
---
Now what if I put 15 into Agility then got the speed demon and bird bones mutations and then used a few items and chems to increase agility further how fast would be able to go?
---
Well I know I can build full X01, Ultracite and Excavator, and T45 arms. Pretty sure I got the arm plans from treasure maps
---
If I collect a bounty I immediately leave the server
---
True and we have had crashes and freezes before, but never the same time ar the exact same moment.
---
I will ask. 
---
When I say friend, I mean a viewer of a friend's stream...so I'm not sure of his exact set up.
---
I know I'm stretching the use of the word friend. Was easier to say that than saying "a viewer of a friend's stream", which is quite ironic cause I have now said "a viewer of a friend's stream" 3 times.
---
Funny old world.

Will tell him that. Cheers

You get 51 points, and the max per stat is 15 points.

Nukesdragons.com has a tool you can use to plan your build if you want to build a specific type of character.

I sell them on the lower end then haha, 9c for dc and 12 for anti
---
You should try it on a keyboard! To scoot forward a little you wobbling back and forth. Have to see if a mod can fix that...
---
Right. The first time you select a plan in your inventory you learn it. After that you can throw them away if you want. But will still have it in crafting.

indeed. go on tell me more.

Someone above suggested updating graphics drivers. Have you tried this? Are you able to say what you have tried that failed to fix it? Might help me rule out certain things.

I love these maps. Anything to help with camera challenges by region would be helpful, imo.

I work in a restaurant and I keep finding bottle caps by the bar.

Digital billboards you could type text in would work efficiently it seems

If you put up an lfg in the multiplayer menu on the game and you will get a response quick. Or on the trading sub on here and you will get one fast!

Workshops.
---
Hemlock Holes Maintenance is the best because you can place 3 acid extractors.  You can also use the waste dump at the south of the map,  Spruce Knob, Abandoned Bog Town,  and Monongah power plant.  They each have 1 place to put an extractor each. 
---
Claim all 5 and bounce around the map for free doing the defend events. I did it thr other day and ended up with over 500 acid.
---
the worst part is the push group content with no text chat

they need to wake up and realize the majority of players do not use mics, and never will
---
umm... giant insects that are about 1/4 my body size? I would think not, otherwise probably wouldn't be very good at stoping bullets either haha. But yeah, the wetsuit too
---
lol yeah . me too. I work in IT so I have electronic and plastic resources out the wazoo. low on steel but its a tire factory so abundance of rubber.

It's up north near the alligator on the map.

This map will show you where to find almost everything. Search for locations, resources, bobble head spawns, etc. Some of this might be spoilers, so use at your own risk.

We're wearing little computers on our wrist, making text chat completely logical. Just make the ui for it old school big green pixels just like the pipboy and terminals. I think it's a licensing issue though.

---
Fair enough. With the right combo of perks, equipment, and chems you can get your strength into the high 30s, maybe 40. It's not quite 50 like you wanted, but it's enough to feel like Thor running around smashing shit with a rolling pin.
---
Read Bethesda‚Äôs patch notes. Lots of players. Too many additions and fixes to mention.
---
The damage from bloodied is a bit too high, it could stand some adjusting downward,  its too much reward for the risk.
---
What we have here is communicate to failure.
---
Yes.  Yes.  Any more questions ?
---
I dunno, wearing even the worst power armor is enough to run around the bunker without dying, even with 20-30 bots chasing you.
---
Gatling Laser handles the assaultrons in 2-3 seconds.
---
I actually farm the sentry bots for fusion cores.
---
The assaultron head skin wasn‚Äôt a skin either, you have to craft a new head and can‚Äôt apply the skin to your existing assaultron heads. It‚Äôs weird indeed.

I want to know how to start up the mr handy and what he actually does!
---
You don't have to be on a team to complete that requirement. I ran across some guy that was wanted. I jumped on a roof, took aim with my sniper rifle and two shots later I had the last requirement to move up to Possum scout. I jumped off the roof, brought the guy back with a stimpack, gave him a thumbs up and heart emote, and went to collect my plans for the backpack. (BTW, sadly this does not remove their wanted status). 
---
You can also hang out at the SBQ, Project Paradise, or especially the impostor Sheep Squash event as there's always people calling for help.  Revive one and you're done.
---
What system are you on?
---
Hahaha :D
---
Same thing happened to me and a friend. He ended up moving his base to fix the problem. I deleted all the wiring and rewired them but still nothing. Tomorrow I‚Äôm going to try scrapping and rebuilding my machines before I go to the extreme of relocating my base.
---
That‚Äôs terrible. Seems like WS has been buggy lately. Yesterday the golf club was all protectrons. It was kinda funny to see one in the ceiling though.
---
What do you want?
---
I sell all drugs at 5c per. however I am level 248 and have more than enough caps to not care if I'm ripping myself off. my store sells everything at 1 and 5 caps except for legendaries which sell for whatever the game auto prices them at.
---
Damn
---
If the PA doubles as a diving suit, then no, that ish shouldn‚Äôt get in that biz.
---
I won't do that quest alone. That thing is a bullet sponge. I have killed 3 of them while they were fighting with something else. I regretted it each time since I have the choice of a really slow death using my rifle, and not using a ton of bullets. Or a quick one with the Handmade, and me crying about how many bullets I've pumped into that thing (though it may be a bit different since I now have a level 50 vs the level 35 from before).
---
Just got this helmet this evening as well lol.
---
Flare guns should scare away death claw like they did I New Vegas.
---
If you can‚Äôt complete free range you don‚Äôt need to be in a group, you need to fix your build. It‚Äôs a pretty easy event.

I agree.

Would be fun!if they make the place filled with cute Teddy bears with sharp teeth...and level 100 ;)
---
You have a strange definition of ‚Äúlimited.‚Äù
---
I wanted that spot too, but that fissure site is at least marked so you can see it and avoid it. A friend built a camp near Pylon V13 and bitched that his place was constantly wrecked, I found an unmarked fissure about 75 meters away.
---
The amount of 3 star guns I've recieved from 1 star enemies is more than one star guns from one star enemies
---
My thoughts on this is if it's not instanced then you can just join the fight with whoever is there. I've heard a rumor that they're going to make the next DLC with instanced quests. So that will suck for us who like to go it alone.
---
I have the spawn at my CAMP near the golf course sometimes.

How is it's in the shop for a limited amount of times strange considering McDonalds does this all the time with the McRib always promoted as back for a limited time.

Here is a tip to help you beat the event. When you start the event it gives you the task of going to the computer and starting the food gathering process. Just don‚Äôt do that for 10-15 mins. The event is still live on the map. This makes the turn out much larger and I have succeeded 4-5 times by just letting it sit and letting people join. I take the time to go around clearing enemies and preparing. The event timer is 30mins but only takes 10 to complete. Also if your not disabling the robots and repairing the turrets that will help a ton. Focus on one room and try to make it tier 3. I have most success on the sludge room. It will spawn a grafton monster alpha which doesn‚Äôt  kill things as easy since it‚Äôs ranged attack is bad and it‚Äôs slow moving. However watch out for the snally gaster spit attacks on the friendly.
---
Kill snallygasters and yao guai. A spot with 3 snallygasters is toxic Larry's meat n go. Kill them, loot them, then hop servers. A spot that can sometimes have three yao guai is middle mountain cabins. Spawn cycles between yao guai, radscorpions, or honeybeasts. Not sure what radscorpions are good for but honeybeasts I think drop a lot of adhesive. If you want guaranteed Yao guai then best bet is dolly sods wilderness. One spawns on the road right in front of where you spawn, and another spawns between there and dolly sods campground. Theres also a guaranteed spawn at silo alpha, but that's only one.
---
I'm a little late to comment on this but I'm totally with you. Made a post about this cancerous weapon as well. Wish it'd get more attention but it's likely going to continue until more people start playing on PvP to see that broken shit
---
If it‚Äôs done right it can work.
---
From what people are saying you need both wasteland and animal friend at the same time now to get the deathclaw. Gunna get a few lvls to move some perks around and try it myself. Will let ya know
---
You can boost over 15 with mutations, chems, gear, and whatnot.
---
Nice. Where can I download the wrap?
---
I mean, on the one hand, the pioneer scout and arkatos skins are literally just skins (texture replacements). The atom shop items are actual new models.
---
However, we've seen them do model swaps with the Four Horseman powerarmor skin sets. So it's clearly doable. Why, then?!?!?
---
Done the camp fire event about 15 times, still haven't gotten an possum badges as a reward
---
600 hours in, I still haven't seen a Flatwoods Monster. Where the heck is this?!
---
I would say Queen runs and kill all the enemies that spawn. Every time the SBQ lands theres about 10 scortched and 3-6 other enemies that spawn. I level real fast doing it. Not to mention you get 1200 exp if you complete the event. Theres also tons of regular SB to kill that fly around.

BOS flag for my camp

Lol, upvoted for the edit :)
---
Been playing since Beta üòâ
---
Oooooh sounds like fun! Let me know!
---
I‚Äôm new to redit so I wouldn‚Äôt know
---
ugh
---
I found out that you can just go to dome 7 at black Mountain and most of the time it will be open, with the quantum paint plans sitting on the table. After 2 tries of doing it the long way and there being no key at the end (1 spawn per server) I just went to black Mountain and got it in less than 5 server hops.
---
That build looks really fun.
---
I‚Äôll have to give that a try. Thank you üëçüëç
---
Run scan and repair in the bethesda launcher, and see if that helps.
---
Whoa Bethesda can you make loot drop off the bots so we can do this dungeon
---
Also I'd like to note that when I tried to pick up the plans it glitched and they stayed on the table. But I checked my inventory and it was in there. So that might happen too.
---
Half dead
---
 The unbattered ones are very rare. You get a screw with those. ;)
---
And just to be clear - both of these spots have a relatively reliable spawn for "ranger outfit", but I've never managed to roll clean on any of them.
---
Yeah, that's where I'm starting to lean, but was hoping to get one legit! hehe
---
I know this was initially true, but I dont think its completely true anymore.
---
I have my CAMP under the Harpers Ferry Bridge. I placed my CAMP beside the middle bridge foundation; however, I spawn in the swamp (near the hidden Chem Shack) while players seem to either spawn where I placed my camp, or on the other side on a bridge support (where they get stuck)
---
Still bugged, not counting any instrument being played :(
---
Thats what Id like to know as well
---
It sounds to me like the game is still a buggy pile of shit. No need to come back yet I guess.
---
Bad server. Switch to a new server and it should work...
---
Thanks for the reply. Probably should have tried that, since 4 SBQ‚Äôs and several hours have been put into one server, lol
---
I hope they can eventually bring the vault building pieces over to build in our camps at some point. Even if we just got the bikes, weightlifting sets, etc to boost our stats that would be cool too
---
Probably I run into this every once in a while and I switch servers and it is fine, so hopefully it works for you
---
Yup noticed this too, seems to do this with Bobbleheads and magazines as well. Dont think its always consistently happening, hard to tell.
---
Then why even do the event? The rewards it gives aren't very valuable at all. It's like you're going there just to prevent others from legendary farming out of some misguided spite and jealousy. If it's a boring even, dont event travel to it? You say to respect others when they arrive there, but that works both ways.
---
Ah, I see. I guess they are just random spawns...Well, I tried to help but I guess I wasn‚Äôt much help lol
---
I‚Äôm level 89 and I‚Äôve only seen a sleeping behemoth in a lake that‚Äôs a set spawn
---
Level 3 shooting you? 2 levels below the minimum required level for PvP?
---
Still appreciated!
---
So the communist version of liberty prime ?
---
I know of at least 2 spawns of the behemoth, Bog town and solomons pond, ive also seen one in the forest region but only once there so I dont think it was a normal spawn
---
oh yeah, my neighbor has a pile of wood that i consider raiding daily so i can boil water.... then you know... i realize "this is real life now"
---
So I actually managed to get responder bot to spawn by Charleston station, but they didn't have it - here's a question though - wouldn't the responder vendor at Whitesprings have the same gear? I wound up bouncing before I could check both, but WS didn't have it either. Merr.
---
Ain‚Äôt no party like a Mothman party...
---
I tried this and it didn‚Äôt work, so that means I‚Äôm an idiot
---
I'll try to do y'all one better.
---
Kill//Face a legendary 3\* ghoul at Whitesprings and either
---
A) the body glitches through the stairs and you have no way of accessing the corpse to even find out whether your "reward" is a 1\*, 2\* or 3\*
---
or
---
B) the body disappears immediately after you kill it, leaving you with nothing to search
---
or 
---
C) you see a 3\* legendary ghoul pop up in front of you and it immediately drops dead to the ground for no apparent reason.. no loot to be had,
---
Gotta love this game sometimes!!
---
Haha. A sucker‚Äôs born every minute ;)
---
Ha, I imagine this being implemented as a vault dweller pulling out a straw and just taking one long continuous slurp until you let go.
---
nope not a single person is left playing. the entire user base has moved on to anthem.
---
Is this your first Fallout game? If not, can you Honestly te me that you didn't pick open every locked door that you come across during the years? Why would it be any different because it's a player camp?
---
you cant blame the user who used their mic, first people complain no one helps/ does what is needed in the event.
---
Now people are complaining that people are trying to communicate and work together hmmm
---
That actually makes sense. If you ever enter the golf club at WS in sneak and eliminate the ghouls stealthily, you'd see a number of them drop from the ceiling (try jumping up into the holes in the upstairs ceiling and you'll see a large area in which they spawn (similar to a drop ceiling). The game code apparently shifts from ghouls to protectrons or liberators after a nuke zone clears at WS. Ergo, protectrons in the ceiling, occasionally.
---
Actually no, we're going backwards.
---
1980-1990, everyone knows math.
---
2019, everyone is a brain dead vegan
---
Close knit teams in a death match game type with battle royal mechanics sounds dope...if it gives cool drops.!
---
I really think people are jumping to conclusions.
---
yep exactly right no one knows basic shit anymore.
---
Yeah I have the same problem I play on PS4 pro as well.
---
That's your internet being shit
---
West Tek/ WS runs. Run to Harpers ferry (Not burrows) if you‚Äôre real desperate.
---
Burrows is too low density to be worth the time.
---
Would you mind helping me out with my revival badges by any chance? I'm also on PS4 and struggling solo.
---
Could be a bad server. It's like when you go into Whitesprings and get no legs. Doesn't mean you're an idiot. Don't say that.
---
Do you play on a ps4 pro?  I dont seem to ever have internet issues on other games.
---
Wierd.... if you died, All your junk is in a bag, not on you
---
3 ‚òÜ  lvl 45 Anti armor mr handy with 40% less dmg while power attacking , +50% limb dmg with electrified mod does 22/26 . If I use while crouched its continuous x2.0 sneak attacks spanking everything . Dunno how it would look if I used perks for sneaks .
---
Good note.
---
The bot that you can get to spawn by Charleston Starion only has 2 outfits per spawn chosen from a random list.  Many are unique to only it like the hunters long coat and what your looking for.  The best way to get the outfit you want is to do it with a friend.  Have your friend hold the bot while you leave the server and join back, his inventory will reset for you and you have another chance to buy outfits.   I‚Äôm on PS4 and would be more than happy to jump on and farm him with you.
---
i had to buy the game and an xbox subscription for my friend so i could transfer stuff. and now he barely ever plays. and trusting "strangers" is a whole other thing. so yeah id enjoy this. i want my alt to be a builder profile, but i cant bring myself to run another 7600 workshops to hunt plans.
---
I know, but like I can't respawn anywhere because the only option on my respawn map (I was right next to the dam which I had discovered already as well as plenty of locations in that area) is vault 76, and when I try to respawn there it says no fast traveling.. hmmm.
---
Most of that is bad press is ppl just not liking a big franchise taking a diffrent turn. I didnt like f04 but all the same mechanics work great in a co op world. Multiplayer launch was borked but most games have a similar experience(at least in recent years) if you like fallout you will like this i guarantee it! Somethings are a bit diffrent but it feels very much like fallout üòÄ
---
Just found a one star furious bolt action pipe that does more damage than my furious hunting rifle. Scripping the hunting rifle tomorrow. I‚Äôve recently realized pipe weapons can be fantastic guns that everyone sleeps on. Not to mention the perk benefit can double on a pipe revolver turned rifle if you have all rifleman and pistol perks. Makes a mean little weapon.
---
This is the only one I've ever seen in my play times. These guys are to rare.
---
Holy shit!l mao that's awesome! I hope they're running a  mechanist build
---
How about to light campfires
---
Place your camp, store some stuff and fast travel to the dam
---
Were you in the Burrows? This has happened to me several times but only when I was there.
---
no, they were born yesterday
---
Think most of it is consoles and most of them are WiFi. Boggles the mind how ppl play with WiFi but there ya go. Apparently lots of ppl do lol
---
Same issue happens to me very frequently for some odd reasons. They've fixed this bug before but somehow it just reoccurring. The pip boy black screen bug has also returned....
---
I am dead and can't even respawn. Currently looking at my dead corpse on the ground
---
Classic
---
Pain Train may seem like a good perk but be wary of friendlies that could turn hostile
---
Respawn at v76 if you can‚Äôt get a friend to join and pick up your junk
---
YES
---
In the Southern edge of The Forest there's a place called Camp Adams, a Pioneer Scout camp: every night there's an event called Campfire Tales, and during this event you can fight a LOT of low-level insects who drop acid-yielding items
---
both your posts suck
---
... Minecraft is one of the best selling games ever made to such a degree it's in the same standing as franchises like Mario and GTA, so trying to act like Fallout 76 having a smaller player base then it is means anything is absurd. And of course it has lower player count then Fallout 4, it sold less copies and Fallout 4 is still extremely popular... As for Sea of Thieves... I mean, yeah, it's a popular light hearted game to fuck around and adventure with you friends with, not surprised it has a large active player base. 
---
As for the 'other sites' you're mentioning, their are either 1. Sites using estimates based on achievements, which well usually a good indication, aren't anything close to scientific or credible as proof or 2. Sites like Vgcharts which hasn't updated the sales numbers since December and even fail to account for PC sales to an obvious degree. I'm going to take a guess you've seen statista's chart of total sales and that's actually using Vgchart's data. Bethesda, being privately traded, only sporadically releases actual accurate numbers for their sales figures, almost everything you find on them is research, surveys and estimated guesses
---
Then don‚Äôt do it on a survival server?
---
I‚Äôve seen three but only in the last three weeks. One was during a nuke zone near the enclave entrance at WS
---
Since you already own it, there's nothing to lose by firing it up and trying for yourself. They've fixed a ton of bugs, and there have been several updates in the last couple months including player vending, a camera related quest line, the Pioneer scout quest line, a mystery involving a new mythical beast, and a legendary vendor that will sell you mystery legendary items for the right price.
---
So that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so many zombie movies and shows. Veganisim!
---
Never saw this post. This was really helpful thanks!
---
Need more people like you. Good job :]
---
Oooh, I didn't know that was a possibility - sadly I'm on PC, but I appreciate the offer! I'll have to see if I can pull it off otherwise. Thanks!
---
People travelling to my camp will spawn behind and open door and ha e to close it to move, and open it to get into my camp. We really need a fast travel welcome mat!
---
Lower. Max damage for bloodied is at 1% health.
---
&gt;Respawn at v76
---
I can't
---
&gt;get a friend
---
...yikes....
---
Big yikes my dude
---
no by the dam by charleston (?) I think
---
PC since you have a new rig.
---
I wrote of another misadventure [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/buaf8i/from_sheepsquatch_killer_to_scorchbeast_dinner/). I'm off to bed. I hope you all enjoy it. I've had an amazing time with this game and sharing my experiences is just as fun.
---
I think it'll come; the game hasn't been out a year yet and I think they're prioritizing bug fixes and adding/balancing mechanics to make the game more enjoyable. That being said, I love this game and, I agree, I cannot wait for Wastelanders and more substantial DLC down the road!
---
That's a very specific paint from a very specific sect of the Children of Atom who won't form or even have access to marine gear for another couple hundred years: your examples of the Brotherhood and the FEV virus aren't as relevant as you're presenting them as in that both the Brotherhood and FEV were canonnically around at this time. Yeah, I guess it would be cool to start ignoring any idea of cannon at all "because it would just be fun to have [your] favourite looking armour" from the future in the game :~p
---
Yes, started a new game the other day and it was a nice break from the grind. If this was ever implemented then I could just have 1 small water purifier..oh would have more camp space. The possibilities..... or give me a robot! Lol
---
What? No that's completely wrong. You do not need an item to start healing you for it to activate. Healing Factor only activates while not in combat. It is 100% a great mutation. I only ever use stimpaks when needed during fights, because as soon as the last body drops my health races back to full.
---
Yeah, sorry.  Also I try to get the vendor bot to spawn at lady Janet‚Äôs soft serve a little north of the vault.  If there is a camp close to Charleston station he won‚Äôt spawn and that pond used to be popular.  If you run towards the overturned jeep on the road once you spawn and then up the hill across the street you can then fall down on the road past the trailer off the little cliff without having to spend time fighting the enemies that spawn at the soft serve.  Good luck!
---
It depends. If you‚Äôre doing any PVP, PA is a dangerous thing to wear, because Boodied builds will bum rush your ass and one shot you. IF you can stagger them first, you might get a Kill/Death ratio of 1 to 5, and that‚Äôs probably being generous. 
---
In PVE, Power Armor is fun as hell, with a Super Sledge or with a Heavy Weapon build, laying waste to everything is pretty satisfying. 
---
That being said, my Heavy Weapon PA character spends a fair amount of time switching out perk cards, because I‚Äôm a Weapon nut. Running around with a .50 Cal, a minigun, a Missile Launcher, a Fat Man, a backup combat rifle for when I want to tag enemies only so everyone gets a shot at a legendary enemy... 15 pts in Weight Reduction perk cards vs 15 pts in damage perks. Pain in the ass, plus being unable to sprint when I‚Äôm in damage mode kinda sucks. 
---
But that‚Äôs my trade off. Seems a little realistic, to be a walking tank that can‚Äôt sprint, doesn‚Äôt it?
---
Someone googled it before, its from a stock image of a goat, barcode even matched
---
No rumor Todd said it recently.
---
They are pretty useless..I agree
---
Sweet! I haven't played FH in a while, maybe I should.
---
I don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôm still salty about it too! If the wall hadn‚Äôt closed I‚Äôd have tried to glitch close with my PA or something like people were doing with early entry to the vaults a while back but even that was a no go. ü§¨
---
Did you drop a bunch of junk?
---
If no... Hit respawn, start, exit
---
Shit work around, but it‚Äôll respawn you (without your junk, and likely on a new server)
---
So you were walking wolf and i was walked by ghoul. Theoreticaly we already have pets. :D
---
The challenges are added via updates and scripts determine which challenges appear each day/week. That being said, with yet another impossible challenge popping up in the weeklies, they need to release a patch to address this immediately. As others have suggested though, they probably won't because fewer atoms earned equals more atoms purchased. I personally don't think it will bump up their revenue that much, but I think it's likely that Beth/Zeni corporate thinks so.
---
They could easily buff stealth by not making you automatically been seen in certain events, IE Management Mole miners in the Uranium Fever event.
---
Prime receivers are usually as powerful as Hardened receivers, and I've found that the muzzle flash of the gun is normal rather than the ultracite blue that the Scortched Killer mods add. I found advice on this forum once to Prime weapons that have no other receiver mods (like the Crossbow, the 50cal, the lmg... mostly the new guns they didn't want to add standard mods for) as it's the only way to increase the damage of the gun without perks or edible/chem effects
---
They don't seem to make a brand new post about it each week (which is what they SHOULD do).  It seems that they're just updating an older post in their news section.  Go to the homepage for FO76, then scroll down to where the news posts exist and it'll be there.  You may have to click "See more".  This one is titled "Atomic Shop Patch 9 Items and Sales)"  They appended "(Updated May 28)" to the end of this title once they updated the post.
---
Prime reciever does more damage across the board. Unless you're going from something like hardened to prime automatic, in which case yeah the damage is lower because of it being auto.
---
I had the same issue after 3 tries. I didn‚Äôt even think to try to just go straight there and see if it was already open tho!
---
People still don't understand how to use pylons at imposter sheepsquatch. 
---
Those high level events are chaotic. I didn't understant what i have to collect (i did find out only about radstags droping venision), until i readed some post here, where guy said you have to collect glowing things.
---
Knew I‚Äôd get some cannon backlash...3/4s of the atom shop is absurd...besides, my precog Patient Zero of the Children of Atom is an amazing artist and used his mental prowess to convey his original Armor paint ideas through space and time ü§™
---
I‚Äôve been playing FO since 97...if Star Trek and Star Wars can create cannon at Will I‚Äôm pretty sure the folks from interplay and black isle won‚Äôt roll over in their graves too much üëçüèª
---
What weapons are you using?
---
Console here..xbox y for eat corpse could use that button. Even if I had to go into the pip it would be worth it or it could automatically harvest and place the resources into our stash!!!
---
This has happened to me as well. I've been having a whole bunch of "Nuuuuuuu!!!! You're too HEAVY!!" prompts come up while nowhere near my weight limit recently
---
Please. These are so cool. Or. Or! And just bear with me... secondary c.a.mp.! Quick c.a.m.p. something temporary. 
---
I just want that tent now.
---
I saw trilion posts from xbox players telling they crash there. That's typical bethesda thing and there was not patch yesterday, so you have to wait another week. 
---
There is no reason to want go down there, if you are not masochist.
---
Also...it would make about as much sense as a Nuka quantum painted X-01 in a theme park üò±
---
Thanks for this reply. Thanks to you, I can confirm the southern Whitespring assault locations along road 83A at the lower southwest and southeast checkpoints are prime locations for Flatwoods Monster/Mothman hunting. Southwest checkpoint at the grassy circle right a little further south from the bridge spawned a Mothman for the first time ever for me, and then just today a Mythical Flatwoods Monster. Meanwhile, today, the southeast checkpoint near the Whitespring bunker spawned a Vengeful Mothman to take down for its wing.
---
Do you need me, to sting you with stimpack in your back?
---
I'd like to see a buff to Chameleon, where if you're wearing more pieces, it'll act like a stealthboy...and the more pieces you wear, the greater the effect. So you could walk/run and stay invisible for a short while.
---
That's correct. Selling the high capacity plan is a pretty easy 5k caps.
---
You must have failed event, because it never spawned me outside during. I died there so many times i would know, being melee is so bad there haha.
---
1000 atoms is 1/6 of the atoms I've gotten as a reward just for playing the game.
---
Like The\_Zimmers says. Perk Loadout Manager. Works great. Should be part of the game.
---
One dude has the old porn stash...lol
---
is this a common thing now?  had this happen at my camp over the weekend and 3 times today at random places in the Mire and Cranberry Bog.  Each time, started out fighting one and then 2 more magically appeared.  When it happened the 3rd time today, I did the "Fuck this shit" and jumped servers, had already wasted enough 308 ammo from my mg42 and caps replacing it.
---
Fallout 76
---
Ok thanks
---
I have both the clean outfit and hat
---
It varies.  Sometimes I'll have several hours long gameplay sessions uninterrupted.  Sometimes I get disconnected in the first 30 minutes to an hour.  Sometimes the servers just crash for unspecified reasons.  We could go round and round discussing the *whys* and *hows*, but in the end it's just some bullshittery going on that we'll never get a clear answer for, nor will we be able to deduce how to fix it (unless we are actually the crew working at bethesda).    
---
You and everyone else that play this game are experiencing the same frustrations and we can only hope further updates will alleviate some of the pain.  Grit your teeth and bear it.  It's happening to everyone.
---
Or just *maybe* it's *your* connection that's spotty.  Who knows.
---
AAE Gatling Plasma hitting at 230 per shot and 95% armor penetration
---
Yeah true even just maybe an ability to paint a factions symbol on our walls or something would look sick
---
I could handle it. Medic Pumps and 300+ stimpacks. No problemo! Also standing behind the bar so only one or two can hit you helps.
---
I used to run the early version of it, but since needing to link in through the website it's just a ballache.
---
I'd rather have tried and have two that suck, than only only have two posts ever and spread negativity
---
Until they fix it to where pets can be revived (or whatever like that), there's little point in caring enough to name it. It only hurts worse. R.I.P Clawstin Powers: May 20th 2019 - May 28th 2019
---
Now that I have a camera I see those damned things everywhere. Picked dozens up from toolboxes, especially ones inside silo's. Can't sell them, can't scrap them and dropping them destroys them.
---
And no, I am not mixing up camera's. I have specifically found the "broken prosnap deluxe camera" multiple times as opposed to the "broken prosnap camera" which I, of course, have found hundreds of times.
---
Are you seriously asking such a painfully obvious question?  Yes and yes.
---
that's what I do
---
Yes, they are too expensive!. If I could get more than one thing I might buy atoms..
---
same, if you're PS4 instead, add me Enigma_Tim. I'll blow myself to smithereens for you.
---
Bloodied is only build with which all enemies don't feel like bulletsponges.
---
im down to do it with you, I farm the hell out off it, sadly I have seen that as well yesterday I tried to do it 3 times, sent text to ppl in the server but no one showed up. I failed the 3 times I think it is imposible to kill the alpha alone before he one hits the friendly animal.
---
Literally any and all named weapons (if they're that important to you).
---
Most of them are [listed on this page.](https://gameranx.com/features/id/165796/article/fallout-76-all-unique-weapons-locations-legendary-gear-guide/)
---
Pets patch pets patch pets patch
---
Triple check that they're actually powered.  Make sure that by hooking the vendor up that you aren't over your power allotment.
---
I could be wrong but I thought the revolver for mysteries could be crafted but the mysteries garb outfit when completed can't be made and is a one off
---
Jesus are people really that stupid?
---
My god i didnt expect that
---
I scrapped my camp and made a small camp, moving it between acid &amp; lead deposits . Collect about 500 acid then move to a lead deposit, you get the idea. 
---
When you reach higher levels there is a spot south where you can have both lead &amp; acid . Downside is a scorchbeast spawns reguraly so you need to take it out so it does not destroy lead extractor
---
Gatling guns are like most weapons in this game. Without upgrades and the proper legendary effects they are junk.
---
Tbh I'm hanging out on the toilet
---
yes it is, I saw a post somewhere her yesterday with the lvls and amout you need to add to the feedeers to get them. If i remeber correctly i think the is 90 to get the highest possible firendly animal. I dont think lab A or C are doable the spawn rate is to low, but in Lab B is doable, I alone have got it to 63 so with a few ppl more im sure is doable but challenging nevertheless.
---
You don't have to do that anymore, it is all done in game. I didn't use it when the web site was needed but I have been using it a few months now. 
---
You do need to and one other mod support, PLE I think it's called and there is a link from the card mod to it. Just add the support file to the EXE folder and the mod to the data folder. If you don't have any other mods yet I'd also suggest getting the FO76 mod loade. It'll take care of adding the lines to the INI and such and you can launch  the game from it if you want but it's not required once you save your mod selection. Makes it a breeze to use!
---
if your in xbox im down to do it with you, its becoming harder and harder to get ppl to join you, even after send text to almost everyone on the server.
---
Nope
---
You need the gun in your inventory to craft the gun
---
It‚Äôs just so you can make it higher level
---
That might cause elitism.  I just want to know if its armor or apparel for sale.  I do not mind if its not armor I want.
---
But newbs gotta newb bro.   It aint about that.
---
Ah thank you. That is good to know
---
One thing that seems almost certain to me, after talking to friends who play and also random people out in the Wasteland, is that the game is slightly more unstable on the Pro than on the old PS4. 
---
Myself and one of my buddies using Pro's tend to get far more bluescreens (rather than disconnects) than other friends using old style PS4s.
---
As for disconnects, only ever really get the group disconnect from server when the server itself fails or whatever. we all get kicked at once rather than just one of us.
---
Once my medical bills finally slow down and I can afford fh4 I'll be sure to put this on, looks amazing!
---
many bugs in this game. Could have been any one of a dozen or so that kept him out. Maybe real life interfered. In MWO had a match with a DC that came up 2 min before the match was over and killed the last two enemy mechs. Then told us someone was knocking on his door when the match started and he went to answer it.
---
I bought the PA hot rodder and never regretted it. I met a really cool player yesterday and he gave me a tour of his camp. It was amazing. He had this floor that was gold and black. I asked him how he got it and he said it from early in the game. I don't remember it but it was small tiled. Anyway it looked amazing and I don't understand why items expire. I'm sure they have their reasons...be nice if they could bring back blasts from the past and let us have a chance to purchase things we missed. I have alot of players comment on my PA and it would be nice if we could share things WE PURCHASE. I mean we use our resources if we build something that we have learned.
---
How about the flare gun is the trigger for the looking for group system?
---
You tag a quest or event, then shoot a flare and everyone on the server gets an event pop up "join 'player' as they attempt to 'kill scorchbeast queen'"
---
Treasure maps and events in the cranberry bog I believe. I recently found some at some bodies vendor for sale and I snatched them up quick.
---
Blood bugs, they drop blood bug probiotics that can be scrapped for acid.
---
Regarding crits, I'm probably in the minority here but I wish they'd just remove the activated crits entirely and go back to a purely random system.
---
I really don't think this would hurt PvP or PvE at all, because vs. players it'd remove the frustration of battles just turning into a free insta-kill button quick draw, and built right a dedicated random crit build can proc crits even more often than with the current system, albeit with you having to pour a lot of attribute points into Luck and detract from your other stats.
---
Hmm im gonna time it against my BE plasma see if it true...
---
First time I did that by accident. Didn't know what would happen. So I ran into the resort hotel for cover. LOL!
---
Nukes and dragons website has a build tool you can check out. Useful.
---
I've been running solo from day 1. I had a teammate for a time, but she skipped out. Now I just look out for myself, try to scavenge what I can, and sometimes go to a nuke site to engage with 20 other guys running around in PA. It's cool though when I'm the only one in a Camo X-01 with a jetpack. Feels good. -mroboto
---
Thanks for the tip! Are you on ps4?
---
High capacity gives you a total weigth of 120 pounds for the back pack, but it gives you -60 DR and -60 ER for me its not worth it having that extra 60 pounds.
---
With a full set of unyielding armor you can get +15 to every SPECIAL except endurance. So just with unyielding armor alone you can get up to 30 of a given stat
---
It‚Äôs been noted before. I haven‚Äôt paid enough attention to wether it has one every time or not. The level 80 one I killed earlier had one.
---
Fuck I posted this exact thread awhile ago because I have multiple characters and I got downvoted because apparently having multiple characters means you can't dislike repeating a grindy mechanic

Tracking a challenge will pop up notifications whenever you complete part of the challenge.

It was a good farming spot before but it's been nurfed

this is the best answer for this most asked question I have seen.

me personally ? I have 1k plus hours and I am very happy with it.
---
Nocturnal needs to have the negative part removed. and they should add an opposite legendary effect too for variation. 
---
Have berserker effect changed to when you take damage your damage output increases for a certain amount of time.
---
Addictions should stay even after death so Junkie builds actually work.
---
I play on pc and some days yes and somedays no. I have no idea what it is but it fixes its self if i close to desktop and re log.
---
Who cares?
---
Bloodied on it's own is fine, what's not fine is when bloodied is combo with sentinels or assasins because those sets basically negate the downside of bloodied entirely and make characters into almost invincible killing machines. Effects/items should synergize, but not that strongly
---
They have [popup campers.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popup_camper) We had one when I was younger and they're kinda meh.  I'm sure they've gotten better in the 10-15 years since we got rid of our last one though. They do suck to put up in the rain but that could be said about tents to.
---
Bye üëã
---
Wow your post on this got a lot more replies than my post on this did.
---
I'm dead. I need to respawn. I click respawn and it says I'm too heavy to fast travel. Does that logic make sense?
---
Play both like i do
---
They get 1 tapped most of the time except when they have some bullshit sentinel's/unyielding/assasins/whatever the fuck set that makes them invincible, personally I think bloodied is fine except when combo'd with those sets as they make the character damn near invincible
---
I have never noticed carry weight perks stop working upon death, nor I have never been able to not respawn because of it.
---
How in one's nature, do you exactly tame a creature of such? 
---
My PSN-    albertomontemayo
---
We had 3 different ones when i was younger and I remember how much my dad hated setting them up only for them to start leaking through the seams when it started to rain. Than we upgraded to a 24' prowler (I think was the brand name) and it was so much nicer. Even had a/c in it
---
Yeah i heard that aswell I‚Äôve just finished changing my points around to run both cards at the same time so will let you know how I go if I can even find one to begin with lol what‚Äôs your most successful random encounter spawn ? Like location wise
---
There's sliders in game for that now
---
I got trapped by a scorchbeast in the one! I was only like lvl 20 something at time. Didn‚Äôt go well..
---
They should make the flare gun act like a pistol syringer in that you can make weird mods for it.
---
Like explosive flares for damage(weaker than a grenade launcher but still viable)
---
Poison flares that create a gas cloud like the new bug bomb that damages enemies over time.
---
Smoke flares that blind enemy vision for easy sneak.
---
And heavy flares for a basic damage boost.
---
Distant Thunder Event üëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèº I have gotten at least 3 T-60 plans from that and I think a T-45.

---
Yes, relog, you will respawn alive, but you‚Äôll have lost your junk drop
---
I dc occassionally but I think it has something to do with my internet a lot of the time.
---
yes. I hear you and feel these are valid issues as well and agree completely. one of the things the game was sold as "all done solo OR with friends"
---
some people want to only play alone sometimes. and...that's ok.
---
Why shoot back tho? Seems stupid as fuck, immature, and most of all stupid as fuck cause you know that if hes alone your going to win and get nothing out of it... Or lose to a bushwacker.

The choice is not even a choice but ppl still go for it.

unless things have changed they aren't going to come out on steam. If they did traditionally you have a key you can use to add a game to your library.
---
Oh current state of the game for me is good I have 1k plus hours and still have a good time. however you and I are not the same so read the previous post for a detailed breakdown of each facet. the poster did a really good job and I agree with everything he says.
---
Thank you for the reply. I did try the stairs but I wasn‚Äôt able to climb them. I would just clip right through the entire staircase like they weren‚Äôt even there
---
Nevet use v sync in any game ever. Also tweak your lod distances a bit to see what helps. Iv noticed that actors to max has little strain while objects seems to put more stress on. Don't know why but lod and vsync helped me.
---
Then sometimes the server is just under a lot of strain so nothing much you can do about that.
---
You can do it. It just takes some rime and a friend so you can take turns backing out and rejoining until you get what your looking for or he drops dead randomly. Usually he just drops dead after 1-6 minutes unfortunately.
---
&gt; Maybe try to manage your weight better? And also figure out why you're dying so frequently that this is even an issue at all? 
---
...Imagine the OP thinking *"Gee, I really hope some random reddit user chimes in here and lectures me on how to play the game*". If you can, then you've hit the nail on the head and given OP just what he/she was REALLY craving!
---
I am offended at the comparison. At Butcher Clete's Strange Meats, our food will never cause you to crap blood. The only blood at Butcher Clete's is in the blood sausage and tick blood tequila. Also the abattoir, but no need to look in there.
---
It will drop you no matter what! It crashes so much it‚Äôs insane. I can‚Äôt even make it down the elevator for crying out loud! And tbh if you want to do it right then you need to communicate.
---
A prime receiver does the same damage as a hardened receiver to any non-Scorched enemy so you'd be wasting ultracite ammo. 
---
With Zealot's Prime Handmade, you are doing +55% damage to scorched and Executioner's Prime Handmade does +88% damage to Scorched below 40% of their health. I personally carry a set of legendary handmades and use the most enemy specific I can to generally save on ammo.
---
I'll have  to upload them next time I'm on. "Retro Flutter" is my GT though.
---
My sloth pete died now I have clyde. 
---
I'll not friend you, my pets would get fried.
---
I see builds like this and wonder "*how is this possible, when the game won't let me add a second story and roof to a first story that's just one staircase high???*"
---
Thanks. :)
---
I believe it's a perk. I haven't done it yet myself but have seen others have interesting tamed creatures at their camps. With brahmin you have to get a brahmin pen plan then build the fertilizer resource and a brahmin will spaw
---
Limited means available for a period of time. 2% of the fan base cares what you look like or your rares. I think all atom shop items except the beta/pre order should be avaliable. Ive wanted the poodle skirt since i got back in to it after 2 months from launch.
---
This has,in fact, happened to many other players. Just because it hasn‚Äôt happened to one does not mean it did not happen to another. 
---
(I really need to apologize to my English teacher. )

I don't mind the group content but give us text chat or a lfg system..

I just bought this and the axe skin. I haven‚Äôt put a suppressor on yet I‚Äôm going to first thing tomorrow now! Lol
---
I have noticed severe lag in Biv‚Äôs door being accessible right after fast traveling.
---
months late here but I was wondering the same. thanks.
---
It would be cool if they did damage too like they did in Battlefield 1.  This way they can be used as traps if shot in doorways when a flood of ghouls is crashing in on you.   Maybe different colored flares too like in Attack on Titan to communicate, I.E. Green = Help; Red = Wanted Player Spotted (or just for aesthetic purposes)
---
This is as close as your ever going to get to that situation
---
I'll come

It was always inferior to West Tek, nerf or not. It shouldn‚Äôt have been and currently be that way.

When you're so incel you roleplay brock turner in fallout.
---
I‚Äôm just going to crawl into my Blackbird armor and weep quietly.
---
I found a bloody explosive per+1 pipe rifle the other day from the legendary vendor :D Needless to say my build is going to change to accommodate it.
---
Is it worth doing the one-off reward quests at level 50 onwards for a higher level drop?
---
Good but bad a Ford üíÅ
---
No, they‚Äôre just ‚Äòmods‚Äô for the backpack
---
Oh my gosh, I literally lol'd. Nice work! Have an upvote for your troubles.
---
awesome :)
---
Absolutely. I‚Äôm not buying shit for the prices they have things at.
---
Yeah they do
---
the rider skins were a one time only thing
---
I would've done a Chevy, if the game had a 50s Chevy, lol.
---
Appreciate it.  Any idea when they are expected to return?
---
no no, its stupid as hell, immature as shit, and stupid as fuck.
---
Repeat that mantra every time these things happen and you will become at peace with the infantile, narcissist asshats who enjoy such petty hobbies.
---
Because in the actual scheme of things, the enjoyment they get out of constantly fucking innocent players over is more often than not, rooted in a serious personality disorder.
---
Hotrodder returned six months later.  So I bet they will be back eventually.
---
Ppl have been grinding whitesprings the wrong way. Killing the Neverending stream of robots is where the xp is at..

thank you very much for your time, and help! :) See you around (Y)

Just did that twice in a row, sad
---
Well... looks like I do have room for Pharma Farma again...
---
Yeah can we please stop fucking nerfing weapons.
---
Nice!  
---
Thanks a lot, always hate trying to get those done, lol
---
They must really dig having you as a neighbour.
---
That I'm not sure of, keep an eye on the official announcements is the best advice I can give really, oh and keep grinding the daily challenges for atoms so when a PA skin you like comes again you can instantly snag it üòé
---
me too, heh so you helped out a great deal today and I'm very grateful :)
---
Never failed it yet. It could be a bug. It has put me a few times inside but seems to like putting me outside more often. In one run me and another player got spawned outside when downed by a deathclaw. Still cleared it. And got the lab coat for it.
---
You mentioned putting away... what about scrapping it completely? I'd try that. Scrap, maybe even log out close game for good measure. Then hop back on, build new vending machines, stock it with 1 test item and connect power to it. Make sure screen actually turns on. See if it shows then...
---
As far as it showing up, you can validate yourself. It won't show green like everyone elses though. It will remain yellow but still have the same icon as the other vending camps.
---
The ability to not control yourself is also a disorder... Especially when its something like a video game. Just sayin
---
buy random shit that you will never use, i have been doing this for a long time and recently I have been looking for low lvl players and buy everything on their machines, this is a win win for me i get to spend some caps that keeps me under the cap limit and I am help the low lvls that might have cap shortage.
---
I do get BGS should do something about it, but you do have many ways to use you caps.
---
Eventually Bethesda will nerf Bloodied builds to the ground so all builds are then equally bad. Problem solved. This is how Bethesda handles ingame balance.
---
Would love this. It would help give a feel of them listening to the fans more
---
not sure what team you are on...but I will say that males (young ones especially) are incredibly impulsive and if not given a healthy outlet will do dumb shit on video games.
---
No problem. I acquired Vamp. minigun already. Thanks anyway.)
---
Not sure about Fury but Psycho requires Digested Goo rather than Toxic Goo.
---
I've been running that on my sniper for a while now lol
---
They‚Äôve said they‚Äôre working on this.
---
Is that at rank 3?
---
Forget stacking. There's nothing I want more than to just be able to delete stairs. Someone on my team placed a foundation and two staircases on it because he was too lazy to run around and up the cliff. 
---
Somehow those stairs are now critical parts of my base and I can't move or delete them. 
---
It took me hours of trial and error to build my base because it incorporates a broken bridge which is part of the map. I can't just tear it down and start again.
---
There is 0 group content, if anything, they should stop with solo content and bring group content, because otherwise there is no point F76 staying online game. If whole game is about solo content, then whats the point it being online game, if I'm not gonna be grouping up and doing content.
---
Yeah, I'm pretty sure once you find it omce, it's everywhere.
---
I had a friend buy one from a vendor - so I wonder if they can be sold? He swore it was the deluxe, but ü§∑
---
Wait.. When did this happen?
---
It *was* a bug, but I thought it was patched - people were literally "renting" the plans
---
True
---
i guess people are sick of checking the map for the event, since it doesnt have a notification. and the rewards arent that great, aside from the legendary and a couple of cool things that only have a small chance of dropping
---
queen of the hunt is a event that you can trigger at the hunters shack. 
---
mistress of mystery is at riverside manor

coming to fruition

---
All the screenshots on the wiki are low resolution and I can't read the inscription. What does that say on the shotgun? (Wiki seemed to imply there were two, but they may be different sides of the weapon.)
---
Stronger enemies yes.
---
However, it will then become a deathtrap where you're just spamming stimpacks to hold off the horde per room, OR you have a bloodied build which makes the stronger enemies feel like paper dolls anyway. ie. Why go in there if West Tek is so much easier for roughly the same amount/type of loot ?
---
They should design the dungeon with at least some puzzles in them to solve, where going in solo rewards -great- loot (enough to do this over West Tek) and have puzzles for GROUPS that drop even -greater- loot.
---
I liked youre posts .
---
just craft ammo
---
I imagine the playerbase saying "Too much think, me want shooty smashy only."
---
It sucks because I want the pack on my 81 and 161, I wish I had a consistent crew lol.
---
In that case, Eagle Eyes and Overdrive may not work either, as they appear to use the same functionality in the ESM.
---
yep
---
I agree
---
I tried to build my camp AT THE CAVE! I couldn't get a single foundation down before I got attacked. Waste of 40 caps, got out of there quick
---
You would really really hate being in VR then.
---
I can't play a VR game for more than 10 minutes before I start to puke.
---
Psn Ryeker
---
Nuke it. You dont get hardened mass ect, but you get bucketloads of bloated glowing ones.
---
I like the one just east at the cross roads of by the Alagator or just north of red rocket truck stop in the more under that bridge. But honestly every random encounter spot has a chance
---
Im not a motion sickness person. This aim acceleration is the only thing it happens with pretty much.
---
The only issue I have with the event are the players themselves.
---
Why the heck are you all protecting that level 85 Glowing Deathclaw when there's a bloody Blood Tick here needing defending?
---
the event is fine, but;
---
1. no global alert
---
2. extremely laggy / framerate issue
---
3. nearly impossible to keep all 3 friendlies alive
---
4. no guarantee drops
---
fix/change no. 1 &amp; 2 and maybe more players will join..
---
no, it isn't a bug  
---
they are so you can mod them with different lenses since they didn't make it to where you could change lenses on a repaired one.  
---
Which is also why they are non tradable- so you get the "bucket list" quest and have to complete it to learn the first mod, the 105mm lens
---
&gt;In that case, Eagle Eyes and Overdrive may not work either, as they appear to use the same functionality in the ESM.
---
You mean   Overdrive  chem?
---
People seem to only be doin it now just for whatever reward they need or just to get it completed .. 
---
iunno it's just another meh event, no unique boss spawn with mechanics or dungeon crawl or nothing .. just another meh area with a loading screen and another meh fetch quest .. 
---
I got other shit to do cause I'm super important, I'm gonna save the planet
---
Perks that don‚Äôt function, that sucks.
---
Yep. I dont pvp cause i dont have the gear. I still play survival for that sweet 20% xp tho. If the server is low pop the i just kill myself at camp so i can keep playing.
---
Did get 1 kill on a triple diget with 2 landmines. Finest survival day. üòÅ
---
Yes. You wont use them sub 50 anyway.
---
What sacrifice? You one-shot everything, bloodied builds have  no drawback. You don't get one shot anyway.
---
Bethesda you listening?
---
I'm willing to pay you real money for some weapon skins....
---
An IRL version exists! Kind of, https://www.campanda.com/magazine/double-awning-trailer_the-de-markies/
---
IM Down! I been lookin to get back into this game. So please hit me up!
---
It gets a bit odd for the energy weapons, where the prime mod fits into something more like the magazine slot in a ballistic weapon. You choose between the +25% damage or other bonuses.
---
You know it.
---
I stopped playing after multiple times having only 5 or 6 deer spawn. There were 4 of us and it was completely impossible to fill the feeder. 
---
It really needs to be a server wide notified event. The rewards pool needs to be more than a stimpack and a frag grenade. And they need to nerf the feeding spawns.
---
"It just works" .. fucking todd
---
Have you played it yet after its been nuked? The Burrows is 10x better then Whitesprings and it gets crazier the more people join. The biggest up side is no power armor needed. I run unyeilding and with that my luck is at 22 and I get tons of ledgendary items every time. On a bad day I walk out of there with six 3* items. This is where I got many of my bloodied and exploding bullet weopons.
---
Yeah let us buy them from Players so we can buy Atom Shop skins for them üòâ
---
Carnivore mutation.
---
Just eat raw meat from stuff you kill. No need to cook or store, and there's animals everywhere.
---
Unless you're specifically stashing up and cooking buff food.
---
I repeated the Biv quest today on Xbox One everything seemed to go all right.
---
razor hawk is female only warhawk is male only .. yeah I did the same thing had to buy both
---
No we just come on here and make out like we do.
---
This is the one we've been most successful with, the sludge collection.  Gotta watch your rads though.  Sludge seems to regenerate quickly plus the molerats have some on them, so you're getting two sources quite quickly to fill the trough.
---
but the badges are not that hard to get- especially if you do the daily atom challenges since a lot of them overlap  
---
truthfully, just play the game as ""normal" and just check like once a week for ones that you have "accidentally" checked of the most requirements for and then "grind" the 3 or 4 esoteric things to complete it
---
Dude Bloodbugs have literal swords for proboscis. We should be dead in one shot from the no matter what.
---
Yeah it works pretty well that was my go to until the venison the other day. But still the sludge is always stable
---
Maybe.. I like being solo and after finishing main and side quests its like dead end to me.. maybe its time to give a break on fo76 until new quests come
---
I would agree with this....there were only 2 of us shooting the radstags in one event and they were few and far between.
---
You finished the quest on your own with 20% health and no stimpacks? 
---
I think someone likes making up stories...
---
If you're on Xbox see me. I sell bulk @ 40 per. GT is sleepy4792
---
I don't play in team nor have a second account and I don't have that much time to play (top one or two hour a day if I'm ready to argue with the missus for it).
---
Honestly the challenges are hard for casual player. I have to fuckin launch a nuke? Are you kidding me? We are speaking about boy scouts right?
---
+1
---
Yeah, also all the food that buffs critical damage, like Blight Soup. It's also possible that all of those do work, but they prevent Better Criticals from working, but that would be weirder.
---
It‚Äôs an awesome area and a challenging event‚Äîbut it requires a lot of coordination and cooperation to do it right. Considering the effort, the rewards seem lacking. Adding that most players don‚Äôt talk and the in game audio is broken half the time, the necessary cooperation is nonexistent.
---
All that, coupled with the fact that it‚Äôs buggy as hell‚Äîcrashes, freezes, items you need to collect not spawning‚Äîit makes it kind of difficult to do at the moment. 
---
If they fix all that and add a global notification it could really turn around.
---
same can be said with the new arkos area .. at least in this area I pop in once in a blue kill the group usually near the entrance for some extra xp then dip .. I don't see myself revisiting arkos unless it's a new toon and I need to complete it for something
---
This place and arkos should have been a real dungeon instance with a unique boss and mechanics like a real multiplayer game
---
bud i have 1200 hours in this game and have done the event that reward "rare outfits" 100's of times and the only one i have got in 1200 hours is the responder fireman outfit ...RNG is RNG
---
my buddy did and he still has em .. I think I need to update my drivers but eh one day .. we both rock nvidia btw
---
You don't have to launch a nuke. I don't have ant of the things you're mentioning and just did the 3 easiest badges, got the 60lb back pack and the mission was over.
---

---
So what's the exact time of when it's fresh to when it becomes insert flux?
---
I wanna know the exact exact time of when they go bad so then next time im in a nuke I don't have to worry.
---
I know it's less than an hour but plz be more specific
---
oh i see... then i guess the drop chance is like 00000.1%, but now i know i'm not the only one at least.
---
This should be the only answer here.
---
This would really be a great idea. They could talk about on how the community can be better by adding new things.
---
This is a little off topic but remember Sister Gwyneth? ‚ÄúNothing is real!‚Äù I found her abandonment of Atom really interesting... and in this game, just east of Graham Mining (if you follow the monorail supports) you will find on painted with Nothing Is Real, in red, with skeletons around. Looks like the Cult of Nothing came first... I want a Cult of Nothing in the next npc fallout game.
---
Berserkers and bashing are the two best legendary prefixes, change my mind
---
Yeah thanks I checked this link, but I was already doing all the events in the region I need. Back to farm then, i guess.
---
Definitely. If you don't want them, people will pay decent caps for things like max level All Rise and Perfect Storm.
---
The pain never leaves. I see the pictures of the pets I've lost as loading screens and I die a little each time. RIP Mr. Cuddlesworth, Mitty, Yogi, Toad, and Greenhorn.
---
I don't do carnivore for so many reasons. One, I DO tend to use food that gives benefits. Two, i've often found that being able to grab some berries as I walk gives me just enough food to get through a rough patch and fast travel to my base. Three, being able to mass harvest flux in nuke zones without worrying about it rotting or having to re-spec my most valuable survival buffs in the most dangerous zone in the game... useful. 
---
In general, i've played that route and I've found that it's not for me.
---
Probably just a simple hunting rifle. They're pretty common so wouldn't be a stretch to just find one quickly even. Scrap enough of them and you can put together a pretty decent sniper rifle setup fairly easily.
---
My harpoon gun is my favorite casual gun to use(quad exploding faster reload). It's definitely not normal but my God is it fun and satisfying to use
---
Nice found it.. [https://www.flickr.com/photos/foxypar4/3203745877](https://www.flickr.com/photos/foxypar4/3203745877)
---
I'm pretty sure that's a sheep
---
Im Level 226 and i got good BE Handmade.Only hit i got whole time was one angler spit or something.
---
Well I did archery, then I looked at the list of things to do and I felt overwhelmed.
---
I tought crypto would be easy, and you have to launch a nuke :D 
---
I have no idea which other I could do and honestly I'm not sure I'll do them. 
---
But good if you managed to :)
---
What‚Äôs wrong with her? The problem is you. You aren‚Äôt drunk enough to tap that yet.
---
Old bug. Even if you don't see the light they're still working. Same thing happened in Fallout 4. Fast travel around or move them and they'll eventually turn on - but it doesn't matter. It's a visual glitch.
---
As for the Mentats - that's useful for "aiming" them.
---
Your lack of knowledge about the game is showing. Try some different play styles. 
---
When you run a bloodied build, you usually run high radiation, and dying removes some of your radiation. With the perk card radicool, that ads up to 5 str depending on how irradiated you are, this can cost you some carry weight.  This is the least annoying part of this mess, as it's usually only about 5 lbs. 
---
What's really annoying is that the carry weight modification from unyielding does not come into play after you die. For me, that's 3 points per armor piece, for a total of 15 str.  Five pounds per point...that can be a hell of a difference. 
---
Some other factor also comes into play, (I suspect something to do with the backpack, or mutations or both) because unyielding armor and that 1 point from radiation damage disappearing is a total of about 80 lbs. I've had close to 200 lbs of carry weight disappear when I die. I honestly haven't been tracking exact amounts of carry weight loss before this, and i need to start doing so. 
---
And I usually die in this game when a lag spike hits and some invisible fucking mob eats my brains before it shows up on my fucking screen. 
---
In short...play the game more, you'll discover neat new ways to make the game more enjoyable, and new bugs to make it more annoying.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt have stopped Bill Cosby ... too soon?
---
That's called "starting a new character" or "I bought this at release".
---
You can keep it on and you'll enter the PA with the backpack on, but the backpack benefits are negated.
---
For what? Your grammar's better than mine.
---
Yeah. I don't think that's possible.
---
I have a feeling it's another "expert" who's played the game maybe 20-30 hours and hasn't found their first unyielding piece yet.
---
It‚Äôs just dumb at this point. Finding a three star in the wild that actually drops a 3* item almost seems like a miracle. The vendor feels like the only place to get one. 
---
And why does the damn sheepsquatch have to be 1* every time? It absorbs a ton of ammo and you get nothing. They make a scotch beast look like a paper tiger.
---
It's automatically unequipped when you get into power armor, just like your armor is. And automatically re-equipped when you get back out of the power armor.
---
Bugs, lags, crashes, oh my!
---
If you need to be revived in fo76 and don't have a friend, get the Mysterious Savior Perk Rank 3.
---
No! That's too cool! But here's something even better!  A pink and orange weird floor tile! You can find it in the Atom shop for 5 dollars.. I mean 500 Atoms!
---
What is Triangle normally? Jump? I'm just trying to figure out what the equivalent PC key would be.
---
I agree and that‚Äôs kinda the point of this post...this game is fun, I‚Äôve been enjoying it since day 1 in beta, I thought the freak out folks had when someone datamined the phrase ‚ÄúZealots Marine‚Äù was laughable.  
---
All by itself the artistry put into the Fo4 Zealots Armor was fantastic.  At the very least it would be nice to have more atom shop skins for the other Armors...(oh and btw...we have Trapper Armor, because, why?  Lotta fisherfolk deep in the Backwoods of West Virginia?  Do I care?  Nope! Glad it‚Äôs there!) charred Trapper Armor covered with cobwebs...go Bethesda let your imaginations run!
---
&gt;only have two posts ever
---
bc I don't sit on Reddit all day, everyday. it's called living life.
---
&gt;spread negativity
---
this is Reddit, the fallout 76 Reddit. everything here is salt and toxicity.
---
I'll admit, it wasn't very nice to say, but it wasn't incredibly rude either. I'd say you should take it more as constructive criticism than as a personal attack on you
---
Um, where did you get that beautiful dildo?
---
Hmmm, I‚Äôm on Xbox but sounds like worth a try. Thanks!
---
...wtf is that?
---
I did the same thing, very frustrating but ultimately our fault for not reading the damn description. Ffffff.
---
I'll buy it from you for 12 caps and a perfectly preserved pie
---
It's not "every time I get a workshop I get attacked" but it's sufficient that I've found that it's not worth the stress and hassle, for me. There are easier ways to farm resources that don't involve hanging out a welcome mat for the most toxic, annoying sub-section of the player base. And, frankly, more enjoyable ones. I enjoy running through zones, fighting enemies, finding legendary gear. 
---
Plus, I legitimately don't need acid. I just crafted more than a thousand 45, 5.56, and about 2k 5mm. I have more than 200 acid left over. Bug parts, various bits of scrap...it's everywhere.
---
It's a rare drop from forest events.
---
Must. Upload.
---
Do swimmer and athelete. 3 of swimmer are just taking photos at the water park. Easy peasy. Athelete is a few obstacle courses. That'll be enough for the bag.
---
Archery is easy enough if you wander around the forest region and 1 shot low levels. There's also a broken crossbow at the palace of the winding path you can server hop for to get the 3 fixes.
---
Awesome, great news, thanks.
---
Weak
---
yeah them really wanted to get rid of it
---
At least you‚Äôre not covered in her vomit though right?
---
A shotgun with Enforcer. Any melee character without those two things are pointless. :P
---
You can use the Awareness perk to see how much resistances are dropped by AA perks or weapons. I have an AA Gatling Plasma and the AA reduces ballistic defense, but NOT energy defense. This also means that the AA part of the Stabilized perk doesn't work with energy weapons.
---
First character level 170 never got the forest camouflage . Got bored started a new character and got forest camp on level 5 character on first try in flatwoods
---
yes
---
Just need more players...like 4 players per habitat...
---
Which one
---
I have the hat and outfit. The hat i found somewhere and the outfit was server hopping the vendor bot at lady janes.
---
I did Archery, Hunter and athlete. Athlete is self explanatory, Archer ain‚Äôt so bad just build a low lvl Cbow with no perks and then bash it against some enemies for the repairs. Yao Guai spawns almost every time in the car park at the cemetery in NorthEast toxic valley, just bring a shotgun, stringer and automatic weapon and world hop a couple times. Hardest part about it finding the spawns for certain kills imo, but a quick search online will help you out, I had them all done in like 2 hours the other day
---
My drunken gunslinger did it a bit older at 22. Revived many players and at one point took two pylons.
---
Also this is the best place for the tadpole kindness virtue. It's a shame that too many bloodied go there, I wasn't able to revive anyone in the shallow water.
---
Nice write up, just wanted to upnuke you and confirm that it is doable. However I did little to no damage to the Imposter and Gutsies, but handled eyebombs like a pro.
---
It's not a theory, it was data-mined that this is that the room is going to be used for
---
Troubleshooter is good against robot ofc, neutral to other type of monsters, the berserker one is not good, you have to be naked to make it worth it, so you will take huge damage to make use of the buff, so go with troubleshooter :)
---
Pvpers only get one update and actually it probably will bring new people to the game. You just sound like someone that wants to complain. Invulnerable enemies and crashing? That's news to me however just like every patch that's been released so far there will be yet more bug fixes. If you don't like what they are doing then quit. It's your choice.
---
I just crashed when buying from the purveyor

WE NEED RESULTS! Not feelings. Pff
---
Why aquaboy and lead belly? Why lifegiver? Why luck of the draw? Why lifesaving stranger?
---
Why no bloody mess and maxed out adrenaline? Why no tenderizer? Why no starched genes? Lone survivor? Class freak? Tank killer? 
---
And the list goes on
---
you can still make purchases from it. turning it off just makes your camp invisible but if its in a noticeable place people tend to snoop around it I have found a couple depowered camps sitting out in the open with shops full of stuff
---
Ah, ok, thanks for explaining it, makes a lot more sense now.
---
It isn't hard to solo, especially if you cripple perk on the boss. 
---
You really only need a decent ranged weapon. Not bloody build myself, but if you are you could prob do it with a 1 star.
---
I'm bloodied with a BE shotgun and all shotgun perks level 204. Good fucking luck soloing that quest lmao
---
Oh shit you're right. I need starched genes. And a few of those I have tho.
---
Results come from feelings. Lack of results come from not give a crap. If it's nothing but a pay check to them then they will do the bare minimum. If they are as passionate about this game as the people who play it then they are going to do what they can to make it the best it can be
---
But lead belly and the stranger are OP.
---
Neither. 
---
Complete 'mayor for a day' at watoga municipal center for a decent sledgehammer (called All Rise)

this post is really old, so I don't think you will get an answer here, better if you create a new post with your question.
---
You and me both
---
Already have it
---
Have you even tried? I have done it multiple times, the only issue is pet being dumb and running up to alpha. Win 4/5 ish
---
Dude I've been farming it every day 5-10 times a day with me and two other people and it's pure luck the friendly lives long enough. 
---
Video the whole mission from start to finish- solo- send me it. And I'll give you 10k caps if you don't die once solo.
---
There's a really nice pre built shack that's nestled into a sheltered mountainside. Has a nice outdoor place with a cooker, and just has an overall nice aesthetic. Only problem is that it's next to a fissure. Tried it for a day, but had to give up lol.
---
It was in the southern savage divide, near the arch/land bridge thing.
---
I would just live to mod it with some colours. Maybe a larger burst to make fireworks.
---
are you on PC? I want those caps. fuck it, ill do it live
---
I'm happy to help you out, my PSN is the same as my username here :)
---
I actually dont mind these new group stuff but the game needs a text chat for it to work for players who play mostly solo
---
I'm never alone. I play with friends.
---
Raider vendor has the pland. I discovered this by accident after wasting an hour server hopping at Watoga trying to get the mod. Flechette mod makes it work more like a shotgun. You lose quite a bit of range but the base damage goes up to around 800.
---
I'm on ps4- obviously it's WAY easier on a PC lmfao. 
---
Send me the video of a solo I'll PayPal you $10
---
A request to join an existing team would be nice too.  You know. Simple basic features that exists in every other online game.

You can disable pacifist on alt characters when in the vault already.

No reason to think there would be better luck on 2 star instead of 3, only more chances.
---
Where's this location at?  I wouldn't mind an xp. Farm camp
---
meh, just know if you cripple the legs and arms alpha stops attacking/moving and crippling with rifles is easy with an auto or shotgun tesla
---
that makes the event a joke and I have done it, don't have the software for vid recording and not going to do it for some promise of pocket change, in game would have been trivial
---
The chances are the same, you just get twice as many chances per day buying 2*

Gimme gimme gimme I need it for my "ghouldfriend"

Jeh Tank Killer cripled the alfa quite fast.Im quite sure there was less enemies when i did it alone.But anyways with unyieldin and Handmade u just can one shot everythin in VATS because AP is almost 40.I struggle more in west teck because the is less space to jump and run.
---
Then go around the tree
---
Jumping at all isn't very sneaky. Players hear you
---
could you elaborate I too would like to aquire the stick
---
I'd rather better things to put in my CAMP...albeit with more CAMP budget as well.
---
I just asked a random guy I game to kill themselves for me and they did. People will usually help you with this.

Hey man no shame in getting paid cash money to prove me wrong.

Unless you can't because it's impossible
---
What you have is what you get.
---
When you get speed demon, no other things make you move faster. No perk cards or chems or legendary effect stacks with it
---
if i had to guess i would say that the recipes were either overlooked, or perhaps due to limitations/problems they were not yet able to implement them?? but from the names it suggests we should be able to use those recipes to change the experience, at some point. perhaps other quests will open up that will have us craft the stuff.
---
Really? I never noticed that my Dr and Er goes down while I wear the HC Bagpack it only give - 60 rad resistance or do I miss something?

They should give PA a little more power. Not a buff per say, but a little bit.. more abilities. PA is trash, lets face it. I have no reason to use PA, wasted 3600 atoms on PA Skins and ill never use PA
---
3 reasons: the words "Server not responding"
---
Play the game, explore, kill stuff, loot scrap, sell to vendors and now exchange legendary items at stations for script then buy RNG legendaries from Berkeley Springs Station from legendary vendor.
---
Rinse repeat.
---
Just heads up. Last week was the last week of wild Appalachia. We're now waiting upon the nuclear winter updates.
---
Im on PS4
---
Locking is done through the building menu in edit mode. When you target the thing you want to lock an option will show in the build menu. For plans the easiest way is through the workshop claiming quests. Find a workshop that's easy to clear, claim it when the quest comes up then server hop and repeat. You could hold the workshop and do the defending events, which also give plans, but it's quicker to hop and reclaim. Plus workshops are pvp areas. Other than that check player vendors. Can't really help with vendor pricing. There's a couple of trading subs, I believe, that might give you an idea. The last Inside the Vault list the top 10 items people buy too which could help.
---
The only thing this build gets right is the strength tab. Everything else needs to be scrapped.
---
Locking a container is an option in build menu when focused on that object.
---
Best place for plans is visiting fellow player vendor stations.
---
No price guide yet.    It helps to get to know all the Legendary Effects for Weapons and Armor...

the build that uses mutations and doesn't have starched genes is broken...

Not only do I not play it, I'm also not making this post.

Thank you but i'm on pc mustard raise.

I'll try to do them when I have some hours up, but honestly I don't know when that will be :) I didnt' play for a week, and I wasn't that thrilled this morning... wait and see.
---
Inclined to agree as getting through doors with steps or onto trainstation platforms is a bit awkward with it.
---
If they do that then we will never get any good content at all, just more burrows crap
---
So much this. I‚Äôve made a few in-game friends but I mostly just like doing my own thing. I kinda like random encounters with others players too. Like you I‚Äôve not even attempted SBQ either. But yeah I find events very team orientated too
---
Strength can go the highest by far. Put 15 into it in level ups, full unyielding is another 15, radicool is 5, whiskey and max drinking perk is 6, you can also get +1str on armour and weapons so that's another +6, max solar power perk is +3. That leaves you at 51. Idk if chems stack with whiskey but if so you could also take buff out or one of its derivatives to go higher
---
You realise there‚Äôs 2 pip boy options , you‚Äôre using the hologram one whereas the one that would be best suited to you would be the material / green and black version , you can toggle between these two easily, however I‚Äôm not sure what the keybind is on whatever platform you‚Äôre on.
---
When huge amount of the population is doing a particular build, that is usually because it is way overpowered compared to the other builds.
---
Bloodied can often 1 shot everything except bosses.   So the health is less a risk because you can position your character to only face 1 mob.  If that mob is going down in 1 hit, there is very little risk.  So the \*only\* risk to bloodied are groups of mobs.  But there is also perks that mitigate damage like the luck perk called Serendipity.
---
I really think Serendipity needs to be removed or Bloodied nerfed.  If you want high rewards, then accept high risk.  
---
Right now bloodied is still low risk and high rewards.   No other build is comparable.
---
Good, thank you!
---
I've got about 6000 shotgun shells and nowhere to shove them that isnt already full of 10mm ammo already. I could even trade them but the player vending machines force me to charge 1 cap per shell. Bulk ammo could be perfect for player vending
---
I can do it in PS4 again if u pay 10k caps. Havent knew before now that u can record your video with PS that cool.
---
Horizon 4 is awesome!
---
Let's see it
---
If you‚Äôre on Xbox I have some plans in my vendor for 50 caps each
---
in some anime it is :)
---
Thank you for your feedback. I have updated accordingly. Do you think this is a cool build? https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=fc4a14a&amp;d=lu2c02ce0s42ss2sm2se2sn2eu0cv2pg2pi2ph2a03l20ii0lp0l71lt2pp2cu2e82&amp;w=&amp;n=Strength and Automatics&amp;m=24689cdfh5egi1
---
Yes I'm fully aware of the fact that there's 2. It's just that on the normal PipBoy the black eats up too much of the yellow and it's honestly as difficult to read the normal one as the holographic PipBoy. That's why I suggested they make different colours. üòÄ
---
Not greed at all.
---
Would love to see that lol
---
Then again, the Imposter Head also takes different mats to craft, so it's not technically a skin, even though the stats are identical.
---
I don't get why it's done that way either though.
---
We ended up beating her though. I don't know how the hell we pulled it off but we did, no thanks to the game's glitchy mechanics.
---
The idea about a motel came to me when Beth put that NO VACANCY sign in the atom shop and I knew I had to use it. Selling appropriate stuff is just something I think fits a RPG.
---
Well my friend doesn't have any feelings for his child but best believe, no results gets him jail time.
---
They did this was the first stream talking through the development of the different alcohols from Biv with the team in Austin. Haven't caught all of the streams but from what I can tell they haven't continued with it
---
Yeah I know they all do but I feel as though the ones im trying seem to spawn the same few events rather then all different ones. I think it‚Äôs just my luck atm tbh lol will try this alligator cross roads
---
I have fixed that. This is the new build. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=fc4a14a&amp;d=lu2c02ce0s42ss2sm2se2sn2eu0cv2pg2pi2ph2a03l20ii0lp0l71lt2pp2cu2ei2&amp;w=&amp;n=Strength and Automatics&amp;m=24689cdfh5egi1
---
I find that most rare, good legendaries only go for trade.
---
Very cool
---
I think I will put 30 binoculars in my shop to appear as weapons...
---
Dunno what to suggest then , maybe fallout 76 has a pip boy app in the AppStore like fo4 did ?
---
I start the quest.
---
I'm on right meow add me TobiasUnderdog and I'll call out when I find one
---
if you‚Äôve already done the quest once you can only have one data in your inventory at a time
---
it‚Äôs been that way since launch
---
They should allow you to change the colour, as you could in fallout. For the text and the light that shines from the pipboy. I hate using a green light as my source of light in the dark.
---
I have free day from work tomorrow ill do it then or tonight
---
Yeah same üòÇ
---
the skins for PAs are ugly (too dirty, scratched everywhere), but I like the PA station one - problem is on every screenshot it's always the bigger one, while I use smaller variant in my CAMP - anyone can confirm whether the skin works only with bigger PA station? I don't want to spend 700 atoms for something that won't fit in my CAMP.
---
I'm going to try this, thanks lads
---
&gt;How do you lock things in your base?
---
When in build mode, look at the item you wish to lock, like a door or resource collector. The options in bottom of screen should tell you which button. IIRC for ps4 it says R2 to lock. You basically press the corresponding button and are greeted with a second prompt with options for lock. It goes from level 1 to 3.
---
&gt;How do I go about mass collecting plans?
---
My advise, You should check other player camps with vending machines. Look for those with tons of plans. I've ran into a few players with 100+ plans all around 50 caps or less. I've even seen a few practically giving them away at 1 cap each. Definitely best option if you just want the most plans in shortest amount of time.
---
Alternatively can find someone who has most plans and ask them to join your team and build these items for you. Other players on your team can build at your camp (except atom shop items). Even if you don't like where they place it, you can always move it later. 
---
&gt;Is there like a community guide to pricing items I can look at so I don't get ripped off of player shops or rip people off myself?
---
Not that i know of. It's pretty simple though, if you're overpriced, you probably won't sell anything. Check out other vendors and use your best judgment. 
---
Legendary can be very expensive depending on weapon and legendary effects. It's difficult to come up with an in depth guide. Check out site below for a breakdown in legendary effects. Some effects clearly give higher advantage over others and some effects pair really well with some and not with others. It's all about getting the right combination on the right weapon type. The better the combination, the rarer and more expensive it will be. I've seen some sell for 50k caps or more... which is ridiculous since you can only have 25k caps max, so players resort to multiple accounts to make those purchases.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
Lastly I'd like to point out vendors give 1400 caps every 20hrs, take full advantage of that. If you get your 1400 daily, you could easily have 5k+ caps every 3 to 4 days. It really isn't that hard to get caps.
---
Greenhouse walls and roof
---
Pretty sure jail time comes from bad results
---
How you can deal so much damage?! How everyone else can?!? I have never had anything dealing even the round 1000. Best ballistic dmg has been two shot dragon with 300 dmg and fatman with 690dmg... And bloodied effect has never increased the dmg, not on paper nor in combat. So is my game like bugged the shit out from the beginning or am I missing out something...?
---
A WS set would be cool indeed to blend in nice on it's surrounding.
---
I hope for a log cabin set. That would be great.
---
I would also try a vault module set like in the fo4 add-on. Might look awesome to have your own vaulty home.
---
Okay send me your psn and I'll add you. I'll come watch with my guys but we won't intervine. Join our team so we can confirm you're not being buffed by team mates and trade me first so I can check you have no heals. 
---
Kill the boss and finish the mission- I'll trade you 10k caps straight
---
I got one then stopped because I don't need 5 backpacks with different mods.  I think people should understand new content isn't meant to be done overnight.  In fact these specific challenges seem more of something to do over time that happens on their own.  Play the game, check back and see how much closer you are.
---
i would love to have the greenhouse glass walls and roofs, been waiting forever for them to add something similar
---
Imagine spending a whole day grinding for something you didn't look into
---
Same! I love the look of it and would love to use it as my backup to save ammo but it's so boring!

Don't forget one gun army and fireproof

It's the first result on google...
---
I'd love to see more ramshackle wooden walks like in fo4, a waste land shanty would be perfect for me and the current sets are a bit too nice
---
My problem with the backpack is that it's a no-brainer perk inducing players to be that much more same
---
Why not stream doing daily challenges...? Just out of curiosity how to handle them properly.
---
Yeah I've done this countless times now since launch so I know that, my inventory didn't even show one technical data when I got to the location even tho I picked 4 up and I know I didn't put any in

Take rad x then.

---
yeeeessshhh while you're shooting a gun 15 perk cards are not at all used or provide support .. while swinging a melee weapon 12 perk cards are not at all used or provide support .. and each damage type is low on it's supporting stat. in a melee build perception is a waster and in a gun build strength is a waste
---
I recommend sticking to one weapon type and use the remaining perk cards to provide better support during combat or at least have a chance to provide some function while in the field.
---
\[Suggestions\]

Luck of the draw, Lucky break, Lead belly can all go they are poop

when doing repairs or scrapping swap in/out weapon artisan/fix it good/scrapper - all other times nerd rage, first aid or pharmacist are better

What do u mean about the heals?
---
Oh my god, yes please.
---
Why is that not a thing?  
---
Also, It'll probably be an "Atom Market" thing.  
---
I just wish they'd add more story into the game... :(
---
Given our location and stuff, I'm surprised we haven't gotten a log cabin set. I hope we do!
---
As a solo player, I find fair that Bethesda designs the game content with player groups in mind. You can already do a lot of things going solo, like exploring, scavenging, etc. 
---
Group gameplay is important to keep the game active and populated, so I recommend you to join a community for when you need a group to play the high end content.
---
I'd like more shanty-esque stuff, too. I remember another thread on here not too long ago talking about it that I participated in. I remember my FO4 settlements having very shanty/MadMax vibes. It was great.
---
I never got one on my main in 700 hours,with times actively serching for them.
---
Then one day i made a alt to do the lvl up challenge fast and got the forest camo as reward for the very first mission.
---
You better buy them on reddit. They are not cheap but you can at least buy them with caps.
---
Hey, same issue here. Looks like it's not just PS4. It's happening on PC too. I'm online but sometimes my friend see me as "main menu" instead of online. Other time they saw me as "offline" even though I'm currently "online".
---
The only way for them to see me as online and able to join is to log off to main menu and rejoin a server.
---
You said you could kill it @20% HP 1 stimpack ?
---
you are right my bad. should had google it first lol 
---
thanks for correcting me.
---
You can tame pretty much every animal but; scorchbeasts, sheepsquatch, fog crawlers, Grafton monster, flatwoods monster, Mothman. There are still plenty of creatures that can be tamed.
---
And it's not even the point of the perk. It's just like Easter egg if you do enough research into it.
---
I got to lvl23 and deleted the character after picking wrong perk card by accident. it's really awesome way to play, except it takes some guts to drop legendaries.
---
Aah yeah.I can have 1Stimpak tho?Thats nice
---
I just think it's odd how people will complain about lack of content or how easy something is then when they add something more difficult like Arktos or these challenges people complain.  I don't get it.
---
Use Google to search for fallout wikis. Or search fallout 76 and weapon name. Plenty of good info out there explaining the different mods for weapons. In general, but only in general, a mod that uses the word "superior" in its description is what you want. Some mods, like a supressor, are beneficial mostly based on one's particular perks and play style.
---
Are you after a specific creature?
---
Niceüëç i love it good job dude . Oh man you should do a nuka cola truck please

 [**u/BethesdaReplied**](https://www.reddit.com/user/BethesdaReplied/) , please note, this is a very unpleasant bug and I hope you will correct it.

When I log in sometimes I notice that I've dropped technical data on the floor, but can't pick it up at all.
---
I got forest camo as random revard from one event on toxic valley and I have 400h played. And that's only clothing I have gotten. I don't get it where and how people have gotten those BoS lab coats, BoS fatigues (the blue urban camo under armor) or Bomber jacket...

Congrats sir, you made my day

Hell, I'm a sniper build and have a shotgun with enforcer.  Handy for when I get mobbed.
---
That sometimes happens upon switching servers. Most of the time the quest will reactivate when you switch servers once more.
---
Haha I know what you mean. Check your map, close your map. Red dot appears, but it's indicating higher gradient than you. Try and jump onto the small ledge that seperates the two of you. Player is 100 metres away, but sees you bunny hop 10 feet into the air. One shot and dead lol.
---
If on PC write me an PN :) Tomorrow is holiday for us germans so give me your Online time and I will die for you &lt;3
---
Lmfao I said this when the game came out made a post too üíî still waiting
---
It clips with foreheads though and just doesn't look right on my character. Not exactly gonna wear a hat to cover am I lol.
---
I‚Äôd just love cleaner varieties of the wood walls and doors.
---
***"The effectiveness of the T-45 power armor was overwhelming... ...protecting the wearers from everything from conventional fire to head on missile impacts."***
---
You'd think a state of the art X-01 would stop a fecking mosquito.
---
Yeah, especially for weapons that people actually use, like Handmade, Tesla, Gauss, Harpoon, or Gatling.
---
I can't count how many times I've been a mile away from an enemy, but somehow him and all his buddies are alerted and hone in on me...even though I've got all Agility Sneak perks maxed. I should not be detected, crouching, while invisible. Meanwhile, other times, I've had enemies stroll right by me....close enough that I could've picked their pockets.
---
Well, I guess I should try to farm it with new character.
---
I do. It's everywhere.
---
But don't they die fast anyway, what's the point?
---
Yeah I can‚Äôt get on for another 2 hours bro
---
PA is still good for nuke zones. Hopefully they make nuke zones better
---
possible that the first,came with the stinging mag,but you havn't actually learned it.
---
it will appear in the mod list on the equiped rifle only.
---
Also the NightVision scopes are horrendous for Red/Green colourblind users
---
BoS fatigues has fixed spawn point on the map, you can find it under one of the tents in Thunder mountain power plant as far as I remember. And Bomber jacket is one of the possible rewards for Returning tecnical data.
---
The concrete set from FO4, and the mechanics of building with it. I could put a build anywhere because restrictions were pretty non-existent.
---
LOL roundy !! I will jump to your server next time I catch you on we havent ran together in awhile.
---
I agree with your first statement, but to me it feels like there are more players. Every server I go on is peppered with vendors. WS sometimes has a dozen. I'm on ps4 so maybe it's platform specific!
---
Is that inside Whitesprings?

Your wall of text looks like you're crying that pvp is still broken but not as broken ad you wish.  1 shotting people is for nerds who would rather play a specific load out with a specific weapon. Get good kid.
---
That's kinda what I was afraid of. Thanks!
---
if you go upper left of the reddit window and edit the posts by new you will see I was responding to a poster just as you are responding to me. the voting thing mixes things up sometimes and you can lose context without chronological order.
---
I see 15k for rare event outfits at times.  They are rare, not sure if many were duped as much as armor and weapons and caps
---
Cheer, thanks for clarifying that it sometimes happens, I was starting to question my sanity lol on whether I'd picked up any or not
---
It says on the description of the skin that you need the actual backpack plans to craft it.
---
Quite possible and I'm dumb for not thinking of that. thanks man! 
---
I'll go craft a s\*&amp;t load of handmades :D
---
I say this to everyone, go all in on one type or weapon. Yes u can swap perks but all in on unarmed melee or rifles is the only way to go imo
---
I block the level 3 and look on map for those close by and block them as well.   If they are crouching, well they dont get blocked unless I see the visually.   But thats ok, just means their trick still wont work on me unless they get another patsy level 3.
---
Ok cool.I cant wait to get in THERE!!!
---
Wow, that's so cool. Good job!
---
Damn i wish you could help me find one too. It is since patch 9 that tamables don't spawn anymore for me at the random event spot. I tried for 6 hours( not consecutive thx god) . It's like they don't load. In the past i could find a tamable in less than 30 minutes.
---
Ur much more likely to get 2god prefexes than 3 especially when it cost done to get a 3* vs a 2
---
PA is supposed to make it's user a mobile weapons platform and one man tank. I'm pretty sure it completely eradicated radiation in the first two games, and stopped you getting burnt by goo in the gecko cave for example. 
---
I like the direction that Bethesda took in 4 by making it almost vehicular, but I still think it should be so much more protective than normal armour, but with it limitations with regards to that. 
---
Haven't worn it once in 76, because it just isn't viable for me, but my friend literally lives in his t60 and will get out of it to sleep/craft/get tuned etc. I like that though, so I might have to give my stashed t60 that knight paint :-).
---
I've seen  a total of 3 mothmen since playing this game and I totally agree some of these challenges are mad.
---
And that was the issue, scrapped a dozen handmades and learned Stinging Magazine, Hair Trigger amongst others.
---
Thanks again!
---
I don‚Äôt think cod fast ttk is right for this game
---
Real talk fun kno  fam
---
You certainly can have more than one at a time and has not been changed. You‚Äôre just wrong.
---
quite sure the peircing is a better mag, but the 35 rounds per clip on the stinging.........
---
yes thats  the responders fireman uniforms a rare event reward
---
I'll start playing it again when it gets a server wide notice as it's not working as it is now plus I've crashed there a few times.
---
&gt; Free range doesn't even seem possible.
---
Top left of the map. I forget the farm name, but it's significantly easier. Spawns a level 50 sheepsquach. I solo it all the time using a bloodied deathclaw gauntlet and have never lost a cow.
---
What suggested it‚Äôs not working? The icon pop up and sound effect don‚Äôt play constantly anymore after you craft a ton
---
Yes I‚Äôm on the pro and get disconnected more than my friends who aren‚Äôt on a pro. Especially if I take a workshop, I know I it won‚Äôt be long before I‚Äôm disconnected.
---
They released a weapon skin just today... that said I‚Äôm getting my atoms back because turns out the shop page misleads you think you can just put either the blue or red on the shotgun but it‚Äôs actually attachment based and that‚Äôs just trash
---
That's what you get for running around looking so delicious.
---
All I want is to be able to lower weapons and I‚Äôll be so happy
---
What a terribly inconvenient long lasting effect for a 1 second hop over a tree log
---
What I noticed yesterday was a bug,had my bloodied crossbow equipped and I had a assassin one on me as well just got it from the legendary vender and my bloodied one showed the same damage 175 instead of 375 until I equipped the assassin one then back to the bloodied one,I couldn't work out when it wasn't one shoting enemy's.
---
Supports my theory that crits have been bugged / max power from the beginning. 100% accuracy plus bypassing armor with auto aim is kinda ridiculous. Some legendaries can achieve a crit every other shot with the right perks.
---
pop them radx and keep some radaway in your favorites wheel. i dont need rad x much anymore,  but i am popping lots of diluted radaway running around white spring. if i had to go thru pipboy to get to it i would constantly be dead. in my favorites wheel i can take one while i am backing away from ghoul mobs.
---
It's punishment for buying ugly skins.
---
There is no increase. Your budget is the same at level 5 as it is at level 200.
---

Pretty much üòπüòπüòπ
---
You can lower in game music like combat music. But all other music other than radios is put on full fucking blast
---
Can i have couple of diluted radaways if i pump in to some rads?
---
ive been trying my ass off to have a successful run, i wait until the timer gets low before starting. and even message higher levels to join. the biggest issue ive been having (xbox) is at least for the last five attempts i get a soft lock on the game shortly after the defense stage starts. I havent had an issue getting people to join though, i find messaging two or three high levels works. i just say arktos? and people show up. but we need it to be more stable. i think a big part if whats killing it is the crashing and freezing. i like the challenge and i dont even mind wasting bullets or chems, but to get halfway through just to freeze is more defeating than failure. i really hope we get a patch next week, cuz at least for me arktos is almost unplayable.
---
I was jumping around with marcupial and the train station where the legendary vender is and a lvl 28 was trying to copy me and I felt bad so I gave him the serum form my stash,got the heart emote from him and I felt great as I'll help out any low lvl player I can as it was hard when we started the game so you sir get a free Internet beer on me :)
---
If you can't beat em' join em' nonsense. And rudely baiting me. So you aren't getting any politeness in return. Ignorant asshole. I can use the same gear and do the same shit. I have it. But it's use doesn't equate to skill, and everyone doing it won't fix balance or the blatant build and weapon diversity problems this silly restriction has created. The little paragraph above the last is tailor-made for idiots like you. Go suck your own prick some more. By which I mean your handmade. Seems that's how you measure your own skill and worth.

I run that and never get any blue screens while playing, your computer is broken.
---
No one needs 5 backpacks with different mods, I just want 1 backpack with 1 mod per toon. None of these backpack mods are something that happens incidentally, you have to actively earn them or you will not ever get them. 
---
No one is complaining that it's meant to be done overnight. I've been at it for about a month now. Literally all I've done in fallout is log in, earn badges for a few hours then go to bed every day since their release. It's tedious and unfun. If you were right, if they happened slowly over the course of a week or two, I'd be totally fine with that, but almost all of the challenges require you to do specific things that you would never otherwise do. Hence you will never earn them if you do not set out to earn them.
---
Don't know what their crit spot is but generally go for the legs. They're pretty ineffective if they can't touch you.
---
&gt; Supports my theory that crits have been bugged / max power from the beginning. 100% accuracy plus bypassing armor with auto aim is kinda ridiculous. Some legendaries can achieve a crit every other shot with the right perks.
---
In this case, isn't it easier to describe the parameters of the weapon and the perks correctly, so that players can build their characters on the basis of correct information? Because now the game is trivially deceiving the player, giving him incorrect data.
---
I've got a Logitech G430 headset and I've never had any problems with it. Works great. Maybe you have another issue.
---
Not had that bug but did get one where I picked up a file and when I got there it was not working so I looked in my inventory and it was there so I dropped it and picked it up and I was able to do it.
---
There's always been diminishing returns for huge stats in these games
---
I have the outfit. Send me a message if your are on PS4 and want it.
---
Low perception stat maybe
---
I honestly just discovered last week that you can add stuff to teammate camps and I‚Äôve been having a BLAST. I like to log on and team up with strangers, and if they‚Äôre a low level I‚Äôll build useful items they might need in a corner ‚Äî and if they‚Äôre a high level, I‚Äôll  do shit like leave plastic flamingos everywhere or fill up a wall with ‚Äúhave you taken your medicine today?‚Äù posters. 
---
One teammate had the most ridiculously overpriced vendor I‚Äôd ever seen (everything was like 15k to 25k) so since he was such an entrepreneur I waited for him to leave his camp and then I spent 15 min filling his roof with tables and chairs. Then I surrounded his camp with more tables and chairs, all arranged like a restaurant. Must‚Äôve made about 30 tables and 50 chairs before his camp budget finally ran out. I sat in a chair till he came back a few minutes after just walking around looking confused
---
I think it's Alt
---
what event?
---
" YOU WILL MAKE FREE MONEY. " Wrong.
---
No one works for free at Bethesda.  They all make money to feed their family.     Thus making anything in game does require time-effort which means these guys need to get paid for it.
---
I just can't get over the slow speed in PA
---
I never think about the diluted radx. I have everything else in my wheel except that. I just never think about it. But yeah I guess I should start using it.
---
Depends.  When I use my Sledge I go for the head, it seems to stagger them.  With my ranged weapons, I just take them out from distance.  If I use my Shotgun and have the Enforcer perk I aim for their legs and they are more like snakes at that point and are easier to kill.

Why do you even get irradiated while collecting
---
Well, we already have it WITH the filter. It just takes 2 trigger pulls with certain weapons and an extra half-millisecond instead of one, at present. Does it make any difference that we remove the filter it then? It wouldn't do anything except make some weapons and play styles work that don't right now and level the playing field a bit.
---
Yup i Think sometimes it drops it. 
---
I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I‚Äôve seen technical data on the rails at Charleston station. at the exact location of the player spawn. And I can‚Äôt pick em up as well
---
Have you done the quest heart of the enemy or just the daily? You should get the quest from the terminal in Fort defiance 4th floor near power armor stations.
---
Thanks, I'll head to the event marathon
---
The only meaningful advice I'd give is to find a way to incorporate bandolier. You are going to likely be carrying an incredibly large amount of ammo for your big guns and bandolier (when maxed out) reduces ammo weight by 90%. It's a strength perk.
---
I agree if the ttk is gonna be that low then the sniper that fires once a minute should one shot. Still don‚Äôt think fast ttk is right for this game though

I've so desperately wanted a second camp in pretty much any form since beta and this item would be perfect, small and one item building so it will take basically no server space. Then allow like 2 types of workbenches, a stash, 4 of other items, no turrets, no genorators, and maybe a different, smaller, less inventory space self powered vendor that you can only build one of. And allow players to build them anywhere camps can be built, not near other camps (due to it being like extra camps space if you could) but maybe allow them to be placed right near other peoples ones of these (having a minimum closeness of like 6 feet so you can't block other peoples ones with yours) so that people could form campsites on the go. And maybe allow campfires and deck chairs to be built just outside them but not allowed to be clipped near an entrance to one (again so other players ones can't be blocked) 
---
Because I love my camp, it's a placed home, it won't move well, and it's perfect where it is. And so are most people's meaning camps aren't used the way they were expected to, people aren't traveling together, setting up their camp on the go and exploring the corners of the maps like that because they get kinda far, get full on junk, then return. And I for one rarely go far from my camp by foot (even though I want to and would be more fun) because if I do I get a certain distance then have to return to scrap stuff and unload into my stash, or fix things, or need more purified water mostly. With this though as a new feature I could travel by foot and really explore the way I want to and the way I do in other fallout games.

---
Also think about gunsmith. It'd make your weapons last longer and big guns are norotious for breaking quickly.
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous how few options we have. I desperately need axial deadzone settings for the love of god
---
I'd prefer my customers didn't also fall off the cliff..
---
the problem I had with one shot builds was that there was no counter. don't know how they would balance it but there needs to be a counter to every build and previously no matter what armor you had or what your endurance was there was just no surviving that vats crit headshot. that is broken pvp too. so I feel for you in a way. but as a workshop owner getting cap farmed at will I don't. power armor should count for something, stealth should not be the only viable playstyle. I am just glad they dropped the payout to 50 caps VS the 200 plus I was paying. I am at 248 now I would just stop taking shops altogether at this point under the old system.What you're championing is a one build only pvp environment and that just sucks for everyone not wanting to be a sniper.  I will give you this though. if they're going to nerf your single shot damage they need to boost your range to compensate for the reload time or reduce your reload time. In open feild you should definately have a huge advantage. GW2 had rangers. I was an engie. in open feild that ranger (archers with pets basically) would jack me up. I had to find cover, however if the ranger followed me inside a structure without his range to protect him I would jack him up. both were viable if played within their strengths and using the terrain was a key element that made the pvp worthwhile and good. good rangers could and often killed me as I often as I killed them. venturing into the big wide open was a risk that I sometimes took to get from point A to point B faster and a well played ranger could easily make me pay for that risk.  that was... well it was good fairly well balanced pvp over all. I would still be playing it but they basically wiped out 3 or 4 years of community building for WvW in order to merge my community with communities of rivals in order to populate less populated WvW servers. they essentially killed any desire to win at wvw for me. but mechanically speaking the PVP in GW2 is the most solid I've seen in any game for a long time. I think 76 would do well to emulate some of their practices.
---
Your speed won‚Äôt be increased by agility but you‚Äôll stop receiving benefits past 30 of any special stat I believe
---
Bulking ammo would be good, then they would sell in the camp vending machine
---
lol well hopefully your RNG is better than mine i have 1200 hours in this game and after 100's of those events at hour 1000 ish i finally got that uniform and is the only rare uniform from any event i have ever gotten.
---
AFAIK it remains the same. Passive effects continue without change. 
---
The only exception would be charisma. You only need 15 to share max rank 5 perk card and sales at vendor have a cap of 175% value. So doesn't matter how high you get charisma, you won't continue to get better prices.
---
I use the perforating magazine ( superior armor penetration ) on my handmades.
---
Aah. Now that is a really good popup camper. Is also completly bear and human proof, thanks to the 7.62mm repellent protection
---
the event often disconnects people. yesterday i did the event 4 times. on 3 times i got disconnected when the alpha arrived. the 4th time i was alone and did all the work till 2nd wave. two other people came in. we got to alpha without disconnect. the other two people shot the alpha in like 20 seconds before i was even able to run there. after this im not hunting for the event anymore.
---
little shoutout: if you are doing the event just get a low dmg weapon and tag the boss til everyone is able to tag it. people doing this event almost only for the 3 star. so dont getting loot sucks. especially because it needs some time.

Well, it's always been a single-player only game till now. Take a look at the FPS games that work well and then apply what they do right to 76's PVP and that's a good way to start. Have you EVER seen an FPS where you couldn't one-shot someone? It's basically what makes short-range and sniping weapons playable. You put that stupid filter in, say, Halo, CoD, or the like, and noone will use anything but specific mad-range high ROF weapons. Which is EXACTLY what happened to FO76. You saw melee and sniper builds before the filter. Afterwards they all disappeared. It's pretty obvious why.
---
they usually spawn 6 at a time at the nac yard south of wotoga. havn't found a weak spot as yet, so I pop 1 from a distance, until it comes out to get me. Hopefully its down past 50% my the time its close,and swap to shot gun.
---
then the rest. If they all come at once..................
---
belly seems to be the most effective, but not to any great degree.
---
nb ... I keep missing you by 30 mins , or have something else  to do. dont take personally. I assume you don't have mike ?
---
Nah they can just make crafting the skin cost those other materials
---
But what about the new ElDeR sCrOlLs?
---
Wah I no get free stuff wah
---
Yeah, no one is about to buy .50 or 5mm at a cap a piece.
---
the event is easy as hell. the main difficulty is to handle the disconnects and other people shredding the alpha before you arrive. the be handmake makes it even easier. i believe him.
---
I've actually added mutations, bandolier &amp; Gunsmith, any other advice?

try just reloading your camera even though it says it has film it bugs out sometimes
---
I don't target any parts of body - just 1-2 swings of my BSS super-sledge is enough to kill it instantly (from 3rd on it's always 1-hit kill with adrenaline perk) ;)
---
I agree accurate information would be better, I'm just not sure what's going on, so that's my guess. 
---
The rad resist value is an even bigger FU imo. You can use chems, foods, and regular armor to get up around 1000, but you'll still take more rads than you would wearing a damaged hazmat suit, with a nominal rating of 500 rad resist.
---
You :)

amazing outfit. i am sold! &lt;3

try to get at least one of the friendly to 60. so you get a stronger friendly. you wont be able to fail when you got a lvl 91 deathclaw.

Hello there

any connected to responders faction in the forest region.

Ok no I love this game but the bad press was mainly because it‚Äôs one of the most technically bankrupt releases to ever happen and is unfortunately still quite unpolished and broken. Bugs permeate absolutely every inch if this thing and we‚Äôre over half a year in. It didn‚Äôt help that it was easy clicks to talk shit about it but don‚Äôt say it wasn‚Äôt warranted like oh everyone‚Äôs just a hater
---
i love the different colour shoes hehe
---
Ok, fair enough. Any ideas? Halo has shield management. That kept TTK up at acceptable levels and still allowed sniping and shotgunning/melee to work well. What would be a Fallout equivalent mechanic we could try introducing?
---
Wow, sounds like you are crying about not being good enough to survive in a game where people's builds are nerfed to pointlessness.
---
Unfortunately fast travel mats are for workshops, not camps. They used to exist but were removed.
---
That's what I was missing, 10 rounds was a big difference is staying power!
---
I have the photos in my gallery and there is the name of the enemy in the right corner when I click
---
That's me when I forget to apply the Fireproof perk card.
---
I'd start by dumping some of that Int. And max out adrenaline. That will really help in those mobs. 
---
But I agree with others; pick a lane. You like to shoot things, dump rifleman and play with heavy guns. You can knock a scorchbeast down and its quick couple of card change and then you can melee it. 
---
That's just some quick thoughts there brother. If you'd like I'll be on later stop on by and check out the new camp and we can spit ball some ideas
---
I can have both now I'll try perforating with the super mutants and gutsys.

Getting two exlosive weapons with weight reduction out of 10 is very good - far better than the rubbish I got with my first 1000 scrip! I did get a  2\* TSE Combat Rifle recently for 50 scrip though.... amazing despite the nerf!
---
being one shot (or two in the case of a handmade) is aggravating, but it would also be horrible pvp if everyone, regardless of gear, was a massive bullet sponge. instead of putting a limit on massive damage per bullet, they should have put a limit on massive damage per blank amount of time.
---
I go for 2 star ranged for the cost value. I would like to go for 3 star but cannot get that much scrip together.
---
I usually go 3x per day and about a 1/4 pf the time I get something decent. I have been chasing an explosive handmade and today got a Vampire explosive ( 2 \* ) which was good.
---
I would prefer 3\* but the only 3rd stat I want is reduced weight.
---
You think that's bad? My automatic railway literally does 0 damage if I hold down the trigger on PvP. I have to burst fire because something with this mechanic is counting it all as one continuous attack (probably something to do with railways not using hitscan) and negating the damage. It's an amazing weapon for PvP being ruined by the fact that Bethesda doesnt know how to balance PvP. Maybe if they don't want people getting 1 shot they should add armor that actually works instead of destroying the only armors worth having.
---
That I think was in the last or recent patch, they removed the 'annoyance' of the sound and icon but the effect still worked.
---
Yeah, not many but I have Biv's quests and campfire event..
---
All rise isn't even a good sledge.

All red rocket service stations have a stash box and bench to scrap stuff. Other people's camps allow the same.

No reason it needs to be realistic or anything I mean watching someone in metal suit bunny hoping 15 feet up and spraying explosive lasers at me isn‚Äôt realistic so just make it take way longer for the auto handmade and such and speed up the re-chamber for the hunting rifle a smidge so it‚Äôs a two shot that can happen a little quicker. I‚Äôd prefer oneshot headshot snipers but frankly this game has a built in aimbot with a damage bonus to boot so no thanks
---
Some youtubers have done videos showing their budget increase as they leveled up.
---
done the main quest. daily - got the dna, go back to defiance and re-read the password.go to uni,do the terminal,do the power,do the centrifuge.
---
At some point in this chain, there WILL be, a lost connection to server,infinate load screen, lockup, you name it. No precise point or location. Last night it was the door into uni. previous, very last step, the door into terminal room. anywhere at any point. soon as I get the dna, i'm stuffed. once and once only, has this gone to completion.
---
And I keep coming back, any sensible person would have given this up for a game of sojies.
---
It was a little bit ago I believe but regardless did you check your inventory after crafting a ton or what?
---
Camp Owners spawn point is relative to the camp device (seemingly 20-30m from it) but Guests have a fixed spawn point at where the camp was first placed down.
---
I do not think it was promised that *everything* in the game will be playable solo, as [this article](https://www.gameinformer.com/2018/09/04/the-new-wasteland-what-to-expect-from-fallout-76#tocitem-2) a few months before release with quotes from Todd Howard and Jeff Gardiner clearly states that events are multiplayer focused, and even that "most can't be completed solo".
---
You can still complete all story quests alone and get your money's worth from the game, so there was no false advertising. Having some end game content designed for high level group players is fine in my opinion, it allows for more interesting and challenging events if not all of them have to cater to all possible types of player.

East of berkeley spring  (city not station)

Well, if you're visiting Crafton dam that explains the problem, you're supposed to be visiting *Grafton* dam.
---
The .50 cal is a pretty nice drop, whereas the pipe could've used a better 3rd prefix (not complaining eirher way). I even recorded my first 1000 scrip run, but youtube insists on being shitty in letting me upload stuff. No way... TSE are now world drops!?!? Or just scrip drops? I wonder if the "legacy" drops arr back, as i have seen someone posting the rarest weapon in the game yet...
---
3* BE Plasma Gatling / 25VATS redux
---
Yesish. You wont survive for even 1 second longer than you would wearing no armor at all anymore in PvP against most of the weapons PvPers are using but as far as armors go its still technically the best stat wise.
---
Sorry but those updates are keeping the game running smoothly. It's an online only game you have to have all updates or you can't play.
---
No way around this.
---
Radroaches are the size of your head, doesn't make them any more dangerous...
---
If we can survive a deathclaw tossing us around like a tin can, I think bloodbugs shouldn't be much of a problem.
---
Jeebus dude. The Institute is one of my favourite factions in the entire Fallout series! I think they are awesome, their colors, weapons and tech is badass. Also you become their leader if you side with them.
---
Still hoping that Institute were the one that won in the Commonwealth.
---
Server crashed after my friend and I had just launched a nuke at the queen this morning üòî
---
If it‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm thinking of it‚Äôs just south/southwest of the southernmost silo, up on the cliff. There are three cabins there. The one you are looking for is the furthest northeast. If you check my post history I posted a link to picture of its‚Äô approximate location in a different thread recently.
---
That's epic! Wish there were more raiders using armors!
---
it's a known bug i have had the same during SBQ fights
---
No problem I was just wondering haha :)
---
I don't play it myself but I've seen others say it's even lower in survival, like 12 caps
---
Thanks for that critical information.
---
The using terrain and close quarters and range that you are talking about is exactly what I want to see come back! But the filter is stopping it. And the sniper builds had some big risks if you ever played one. You had ONE crit, and if you fucked it up you were dog meat. Then you had to charge another crit, during which time you were extremely vulnerable. Especially Bloodied builds. And it had 3 hard counters: Crouching, Stealth Boys and teams. You can't VATS a crouched or stealthed player and if they had a friend they could just clean you up after you fired and stim their downed teammate. And if you wanted to run Bloodied and you got seen at all you were dead in an instant because someone could sneeze on you and kill you. If you played a sniper back then you would know that for every time you wrecked shit, you got wrecked back by other builds. It was rock-paper-scissors, as it should be, imo.
---
I think it‚Äôs old game notifications clearing out. I believe they will go away with some time
---
But what makes the bloodbugs dangerous isn't the damage that they do directly, it's their poisonous sting (unless I am mistaken).   I bet that if you had a set of poisoners armour that they wouldn't be anywhere near as effective.  Also, I haven't tried out the insect repellent that you get from one of the Tadpole quests, but that should help too.
---
I joined a Sheepsquatch event the other day.  Just as I traveled a kid I didn't know walked into my apartment.  Turned out that the family was staying with friends at the same apartment number but at a different building (they all look the same).
---
Needless to say, while I was dealing with that my character just took a pounding and did nothing to help out.   So, yeah, life intrudes sometimes...
---
Is there nobody think that new mode will be horde  like Gears of War?
---
Needs more damage too üôÑ
---
i also use the perk that makes stims and radaway work quicker, in charisma i think, if you have the space in perk points
---
This happened to my power armor a while back. I updated, but didn't know I had to change the ini for my mods so my blackbird t51 turned into silicon dildo t51. I'll post the picture when I get home, lol.
---
if it's not working on radtoads try taking a photo of one of the nomal frogs at whitesprings swimming pool next to the golf club or just keep taking photo's of every radtoad you come across
---
I run with the stinging. However, not listed on the stats, is the armour penetration. More damage,less rounds required.
---
ALL rifles, max damage (not shown) is the peircing . Then theres the trade off. weight , rounds/per,
---
reload time, blah blah blah. ya pays your money,ya makes your choise.
---
cheers
---
Wow what a beauty! Good Job!
---
The difference is that there are work arounds for deaf people. You may want to read up on the new EU laws going into effect that deals with deaf people.
---
Because **radworms.**
---
Same here
---
It sometimes happened that quest disappears - go to inventory/misc, drop the Technical Data on the floor and pick it up - quests starts again.
---
Lmao... Made my day!
---
You must not play much if you don't know about the invulnerable enemies being back: https://gfycat.com/lavishillustriousharborseal-fallout-76
---
or the massive issue with arktos crashing nearly 50% of the people who try to go down to it. Part of the posted "strategy guide" for it even mentions to be quick as possible because you have a high likelyhood of crashing.
---
Damn thats AWESOME doc!
---
Not to bad man.
---
If you ran a bloodied build with right perks it could do over 2300 a shot
---
When are you holding the BBQ?     .grin.
---
I appreciate it.  Yea we can chat about it in game. Would be easier. 
---
And yea I'm excited to check it out!
---
When will you be on?  It's my 2 work days so I'll only be on today at 9am before my 2 off days Thursday and Friday
---
Yeah mostly already dead sadly...
---
Would love to encounter a tameable lil slothy
---
It is still being beaten by games like "sea of theives" also that website is only for xbox, not overall. If you look up other sites they claim only 400k people play the game tops. 
---
Hell, it is being beat by fallout 4, the previous game in the series. LOL
---
Yeah but sometimes I need to fix things or craft things like from nuke zones and even if I do just need s stash box it could be a big detour on my adventure, and it's not the same as having a little camp that I can set up and relax at by the fire or something while waiting for day or whatever. That feeling of having a camp to set up at as you're own little actual campsite
---
Shitty. Power armor being a joke needs attention too, imo. I'm OK with someone running power armor being a bullet-sponge. They can't use legandary armor, and have a lot of other restrictions. I would go so far as to say doubling it's base armor values is needed to make it PVP competitive. You might have to tweak or remove the Emergency Protocols card though.
---
I'd say the same for sitting and sleeping as well. Sick of being stuck in animations for \~20 seconds and getting a disease from accidentally clicking on a sleeping bag.
---
This is bethesda, do you honestly think it will be done right? Because with their current track record with this game, I doubt it.
---
Well I'm just getting to work now so it'll be about 10 hours or so
---
You can get badges from the campfire event AND the two dailys available (the clean up one and the insect parts one), they are a rare drop but I've had badges from all 3 quests before.
---
Awesome XD
---
Agree... Better a patch every know an then before a fps hell or server disco fever
---
Maybe a machine at train stations. Or the ammo buying machines could have an option to convert...
---
With a very bad ratio (like 10:1, or something).
---
If you complete [The Path to Enlightenment](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Path_to_Enlightenment), a wise and friendly mothman will appear.
---
I don't want water to go directly to stash- i have two small (?) purifiers that hold two and produce 12/hour and I still sell i off to vendors a couple times a week and I don't want either of the two scenarios  
---
1) come back from hours of scrounging to a stash full of water that I have to remove first  
---
2) have no water because my stash is full, which it is about 50% of the time (and 90% of the time it only has about 25 units leeway)  
---
They should make purifiers hold more, at least the hourly amount imo
---
Does *Excalibur* or *Thors Hammer* say something to you?

I've seen crazy people selling 3 caps a piece for 5mm and .50 :))))
---
Have you read some of the lore on PA? 
---
&gt;"The effectiveness of the T-45 power armor was overwhelming... ...protecting the wearers from everything from conventional fire to head on missile impacts."
---
I highly doubt a sword would do much if a missile explosion doesn't.
---
But if you put the hammer in an elevator?...
---
I think it's already there a challenge to take a photo of a frog but I will try
---
Yes.
---
Family owns a small farm. After fallout 4 came out every time I glanced at the mech shop or a pallet stack or wall of tires I just thought of all the materials...
---
lol
---
I pretty much like the elevator simulator.
---
Should have the background music of rose radio.
---
You dont need armorer, and power patcher, while good to have, doesn't need to be slotted for combat as PA is incredibly durable. Gunsmith would be much more useful.
---
I tried picking up my reward but it wouldn't let me, I reloaded and now it's disappeared
---
The guy in the metal suit is conspicuous, slow, and a big target. People laugh at power armor in PVP. It's an easy kill, what without legendary armor effects. And what about Melee? Right now you have the disadvantage of having to GET to your opponent while they are shooting at you. Then when you even get there, you have to hit them multiple times with a (generally) slow weapon. That's why you never see a competitive super sledge. If it was guaranteed to kill in one shot, your job would be to keep the melee guy away from you. And if you get in close-quarters with a melee guy that's your mistake. Just like in most shooters you don't walk into the room where the guy with the shotgun is waiting, and the guy with the shotgun shouldn't stand in an open field. And crouching or stealthboys hard-counter VATS. A Dragon headshot doing over 3k damage should kill. It takes the sniper half a minute to reload, so sure he might get you sometimes, but you just deal with them like you do snipers in any other FPS: cover, rushing, taking them in a group, getting close with melee, etc...
---
Yeah but still, having played speed demon w/o pa.. Can't go back
---
What does Excalibur or Thor's Hammer have to do with a quest reward?
---
Except for the last 4 or so patches have made the game far buggier and less stable. Hell, the invincible enemies are back from  pre patch 5.
---
Did the bundle cost you 1800 atoms ? or 1400 atoms only ? Since Hotter Rod Bundle &amp; Hotter rod Paint shares the same thumbnail so it might be very easy to confuse.
---
if you believe that you were purchasing the right one and didn't getting the whole package. I'll suggest you to submit a ticket to Bethesda, I'm very sure they'll help !
---
I would focus more points in gunsmith since fusion cores aren‚Äôt that hard to come by and power armor already takes forever to get destroyed, repairing guns will take most of your recourses even with full gunsmith.
---
10mm pistol with some good legendary effects: they last forever, the ammo is easy to craft/find on low level mobs, and they're highly customisable to anyone's liking/build.
---
A shotgun with Enforcer is another good secondary as another described; Enforcer is one of the best perks in the game against tough enemies.
---
I accidentally scrapped my flare gun, and haven't found a new one yet üòí
---
Ok I stopped reading after that first sentence as it‚Äôs not really relevant to what I had just said. It had nothing to with power armors viability.
---
My team BD that you can check, [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f319f58&amp;d=sb2s01eu0ic3lu2lt2l71s72a00cu0ce0pe2sq2s22sr0cd1id2ip2a80s32ib4ck0cf2&amp;w=&amp;n=SupportGunner&amp;m=12498dcbaief6](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f319f58&amp;d=sb2s01eu0ic3lu2lt2l71s72a00cu0ce0pe2sq2s22sr0cd1id2ip2a80s32ib4ck0cf2&amp;w=&amp;n=SupportGunner&amp;m=12498dcbaief6)
---
I if you play survival mod, move 3 charisma stats to endurance and pick fireproof .
---
Very good summary
---
With the current state of the game, they do not need much feedback, written in different communities have of course the information they need a long time, about fixing things.
---
Possibly a streaming of suggestions ... would be filled with hater, or simply unhappy users given that they do not give sufficient priority to solve serious current bugs (load screens where dead / trapped / etc, communication, location problems, performance , pvp ...).
---
And for that reason they can not have streamer partners either because they would also show live thousands and thousands of bugs and bugs.
---
If the game went well, they could do as with Warframe, with streamer to narrate their stories, specific things and if, also related topics such as stories of characters, areas, weapons, etc, both the story of fallout as it is in the real life.
---
And logically they could give or give away varied atoms and cosmetics.
---
I suppose that all this was in his plans but ... I suppose that release pressures for the consoles and having a secondary equipment for the game, causes the current state of the game.
---
all the times
---
Agreed. The updates aren't even that bad. Mine is always up to date and i can play on demand. His own fault for waiting until last minute to update right before trying to play.
---
Mine is set to auto update soon as patch comes out. All my games are. Even if it wasn't, can simply manually set patch to download overnight while you sleep, work, school etc.
---
I only discuss power armor for 3 sentences, I promise. lol
---
Happened to be with a quest on Xbox. The game glitched as I ended up with one in my inventory but the one on the ground I couldn't pick up was kinda there just to confuse. So check if it's in your inventory already
---
there are some standard radtoads outside the school in grafton if it doesn't work
---
I have three level 100+ characters. I haven't seen invulnerable enemies or at least not since launch. I've also never had arktos crash on me and the game doesn't crashes anymore and rarely the servers go down. I haven't personally experienced these bugs. So I don't know what the problem is however I doubt it's anywhere near 50% and there are probably those who lie about it as well as fallout has some with an unhealthy obsession with trashing the game and they tend to hang out on reddit.
---
I was at the repair yard yesterday, which is what promoted the question. Initially the Gulpers were fighting with some Mutants, so I tried to expedite matters with a few Nuka grenades. Sadly whilst the Mutants fell, the pack of Gulpers remained. Not finding a satisfactory approach, I fell back to crippling legs and withdrawing to a safe distance.
---
I'm afraid I do tend to log off just before 10 at the moment, though that will likely change in a few weeks. I do have a mic but it can pickup my surround system.
---
I've come across a few and unfortunately it's one of the saddest things in the game. There's a random encounter where a megasloth will be fighting 2 or 3 yao guia. If you get in closer and have a look you'll find the yogis have already killed the baby :(
---
One goal gives you the worst rewards tho gotta do 3 to get the good shit
---
Your going to have to grind. Almost all of us that have God tier weapons and tons of plans have been playing since beta or launch.
---
I‚Äôll give it ago now
---
Ok thanks I'll check in my inventory later, it's a bit weird though still
---
I supplied video of it happening...
---
never played a bloody stealth sniper so my perspective only comes from the receiving end as a power armor wearing loot pinata. ( I take shops for the resources and because I like to build things and try to set up defenses.) 
---
Initially I tried to fight back, I like building defenses etc- maxed out all of my endurance perks - maxed out all damage mitigation perks used psycho tats and endurance foods - I could face tank the queen and the entire bog. I essentially was as tanky as possible in power armor. nothing worked. I feel like in my case I should at least have been able to survive enough to get some cover and escape if I used terrain right etc but it was just one shot dying all day every day. been gaming since 96 this is the first time I have ever shunned pvp in a game entirely. I have pvped in some pretty brutal circumstances as well, vanilla UO, and ARK survival evolved hardcore mode being the two most severe death penalties. I am not a guy who gives up easily. but pvp in this game. I just fucking hate it.
---
I was wondering that why they where dead,that would be cool tho
---
Here are many more people also complaining about not even being able to get into arktos without crashing.
---

---
Hey that's the one I seen,that's sucks tho
---
Well.... the damn phone seems to think it knows what im about to type and fills in the words for me. Didn't even notice till you pointed it out.
---
I tried with the Radtoads of Path of Enlightment (I think they were standard radtoads, level 5) and some Radtoads at Grafton. I will check the variants
---
I've tamed a Deathclaw, Snallygaster and mirelurk king since then, but not a sloth or mirelurk crab. All from the spot between Abbey's Bunker and Thunder Mountain, so I think it's just bad RNG luck on your end.
---
I'll trade you for them
---
I would guess as much as you like sniper big crit stealthy sneak sneak - I like power armor big health pool damage mitigating tanky. and that doesnt work in pvp at all in 76.
---
I have the outfit and have been offered 10 k for it  seems a fair price to me but always at cap limit so never I never accept.  But 10-15 seems normal.
---
Or maybe just let us scrap unwanted ammo for lead gunpowder and steel...
---
Tell that to the players who keep killing them. I've lost five to assholes with TSEs since vending.
---
I completely agree with you. Power armor needs a massive damage mitigation buff to be viable. But until that happens, the guy with the handmade will kill you as fast as the sniper. At least removing the one-shot filter will bring back snipers and melee builds. I think power armor needs to be a damage sponge that can take a massive beating even in PVP to compensate for no legendary parts and not being stealthy. Double it's base armor, maybe. Make it highly resistant to explosive damage. Then it would be competitive.
---
Have the daily events arrived at far or are they still on their way?
---
Kill mole miners and scrap their suits.
---
Deathclaws have black titanium, and some mole miner junk items have it too. If you need to find miners, try a mining area or the ash heap.
---
Deathclaw island is a good place to farm, also mole miners tend to drop a few
---
i would love the tunnel snake hair or punk raider styles
---
Kill Mole Miners and scrap the suits it will give you Black Titanium.
---
My game is all patched up and 'smoothly running' isn't the term here.. maybe when i am the only one on the map late late night.. it's lags and fps hiccups everywhere! :D
---
Ironically I can‚Äôt find mole miners now üôÑ
---
I had the White Springs, White Powder and BOS jumpsuits drop a couple days ago. I have no idea how many events I've done in the area they drop in but it's a hell of a lot, I'm pretty sure.
---
The rare outfits are pretty rare.
---
simply headshot
---
Its like people just get on reddit and whine when they have a semi coherent thought, instead of reading the 8000 posts already made whining about the same goddamned thing.
---
FO4 just let you change the color of the pipboy in the INI files. NO app needed.
---
Breach and Clear in the Ash Heap or you can grab some from a Player Vendor.
---
Thee beset places I found are : Mole miners, scrap their respirators. Deathclaws. Breach and clear event.
---
Blackwater mine near whitesprings has mole miners a'plenty. If you're lucky the uranium fever event will spawn while you're there too...
---
Yeah, I've been saying the same thing about colorblind mode, and a text chat for deaf players. Seems bethesda doesn't care about players who have colorblindness or are deaf.
---
Did you get them separately? I've heard it can drop all 3 at the same time upon completion.
---
It sucks, literally all games today support colourblind and deaf people.
---
Personally I just want a compact Garden Plot / Green House tile. About the size of a foundation tile that snaps to foundations that are by dirt (or just snap to a foundation if it's a green house style)
---
It'd make a little nook and cranny garden like my, stuck between the cliff face and my wall, a lot easier to get down.
---
Not in Pa you don't, as the stimpack animation doesn't play while in PA.
---
Agreed.
---
I‚Äôve been populating the wasteland with discarded missiles.
---
As a player in any open world pvp environment I have always leaned to the guard dog side of the wolf, guarddog, sheep, analogy. as a guard dog you need the tankiness to have room to assess. if you're a wolf and going straight after kills the world is your target but as a guard dog you automatically give up first strike because you don't want to murder the sheep or fellow guard dogs.which means you have to be able to take that first hit. its my favorite thing. this is the first game I cant do that. Maybe as a high health stealther with vanguards I could pull it off but I just really hate the stealth mechanic lol. well and I love jump jets and all that for everything else.
---
At the very least I don't understand why they don't let us change the pipboy color in the INI files like they did in FO4. It makes no sense, and only harms players.
---
There are some guys who like to enter the event then reject the event in their pip boy. Then they unleash Tesla rifles and can clear the room in one hit.  Most of the time it's fine. But sometimes ....
---
Welch has mole miners and none are above a level 22 if I remember correctly.
---
Its just things like the colours of the Pipboy that Bethesda want to capitalize on in the Atomic Shop. Like its a colour you know you don't need to try and make money of it.
---
And there's a bunch of people who just lie because they think they Bethesda wronged them somehow. If you Google fallout 76 nothing comes up that talks about it from any major publication. In fact they all seem to agree that the game is in a lot better state these days so they obviously aren't experiencing it. Also these people who claim this has happened to them don't seem to want to fix the problem but instead just complain. They don't want to do any trouble shooting such as reinstalling the game or updating drivers, the simple things that you're suppose to do when a game isn't working right. So like I said I don't know what to believe. 
---
There maybe people that are in fact having issues but it could be on there end on why it's happening because not everyone is experience it. Also I think some people are just lying because are obsessed with throwing shade on the game. It has always made me wonder why so many who don't like the game still subscribe to its subreddit and why not just move on to something else. There's plenty of games I don't like but I don't follow those games on reddit checking its status every few hours looking for post where I can hate on it.
---
I love and support her absolutely ü§£!
---
yes but did you hit the reload button
---
Swimmer an athlete like EVERY guide tells you
---
Did you miss the fact the vast majority of them are on xbox? How do you update drivers on xbox? You are literally just making any excuse to agree with your preconcieved notions.
---
Also no major publications are talking about how buggy arktos is? Want me to link you a half dozen Like I did above with posts from players who literally bend over backwards to make this game sound great? Did you even check half the players post histories I just shared? 90% of them are fallout 76 can do no wrong players and use the filthy casuals subreddit.
---
They are literally the people who defended bethesda when they doxxed the entire player base.
---
The pipboy skins don't change the UI colors, so that really doesn't even make sense either. The skins only change the skin on the pipboy, not the interface itself.
---
Just waiting to read the Reddit hate that will be on this post.
---
You're having comminication problems. Go to the doctor, they can help you
---
The crash at the elevator is a known xbox bug at the moment.  Sorry mate.
---
i'm not trying to be "that guy" but it sounds like you need to work on you. i'm not a people person myself but i learned to get by in this multiplayer fallout. this game was not meant for "solo" play, that is why it is the way it is and not a solo adventure as some would rather have had.
---
The caps are gone?
---
Run Uranium Fever when it's up.  If it isn't up, run out there anyways and see if it's possible that no one has started it yet since the cooldown period on it expired.  Plenty of them in there.  Also, just simply run around to all the mineshaft icon map marker locations in the Ash Heap.   Also check player vendors.  Often times I find people selling boatloads of the stuff for cheap.
---
How come??
---
Hey, I would run power armor if it worked, simply for the cool factor. I WANT it to be good. I think you could make it work, and here's how:
---
Percentages.
---
75% inherent explosive and ballistic resistance for a full set. 
---
Oh, I just shot you with a rifle crit that did 3k damage? you only TAKE 1k, minus your armor, so \~300. And with the right perk cards (Lone Wanderer, etc..) that's going to be even less.
---
To balance that out, don't let it work with some mutations. Energy weapons still do normal damage (Yay! A reason to use energy weapons, FINALLY!), EMP grenade vulnerability. And bludgeoning damage still doing normal damage. 
---
Why?
---
Think about holding an armored plate to your chest. Someone shoots it with a conventional rifle, you are fine. Someone hits you with a laser or plasma weapon, you'll be fine BUT that heated metal is going to burn so you will take some damage. Then somebody whacks you with a sledgehammer. The kinetic energy of a massive object hitting you is going to hurt, even if the steel plate protects you. So it all makes logical sense.
---
They would be great for a quick CAMP, whilst out and about, when you just need a single workbench or access to your stash.
---
They should replace every insect with gazadors to balance the physics

If you post anything complaining about the game on this sub people freak out lol
---
Not sure why they couldn't adjust the occurrence chance of 2\*/3\* enemies instead. 
---
Over the months, with the same character, the 3\* dropping 3\* chance went from 40% down to 15% and the overall 3\* drop chance went from 7% to 2.5%.
---
I play multiple hours a day and I don't have any of the problems you are describing.
---
 Sounds like either you have really bad luck or you should maybe upgrade that Box with an X on it to a better system.
---
much needed the planters are everywhere in the world other than in our camps should have been a thing from day one....
---
Typical human thinking, told not to do something as it is dangerous, humans response, "F\*ck it, I'm gonna go do it!". News transmission later the same day, "Man/Woman dies due to stubbornness/stupidity."
---
the same thing before lvl 50, and yes getting your unicorn equipment is a pain but it should be.
---
Not what I was getting at.
---
I found it in my inventory as "Silver Lining"
---
It's a *live service* game. Updates are standard. Are you new here?
---
Nice

The suggestions about killing Mole Miners are better than this one (I mean, loot, XP, black titanium, what's not to like?) but you can also buy U Mine It maps from a vending machine that's in several locations (the easiest one to get to is one by the front door of the Nuka Cola plant). They don't cost a ton of caps (something like 50-150) and point to locations in the Ash Heap where there are buried stashes of different types of buried metals (they act the same as the Treasure maps). You click on a mound and there's your metals. The cost of the map correlates to how many of each type of metal you'll find, something like 5-15 of each type, including black titanium. Again, killing mole miners is cheaper and basically free, but just offering up another option.
---
Same. Had 3 spawn west of the clubhouse along with 4-5 regular super mutants.
---
I thought they fixed that? I mean, junkie still too weak of an effect but
---
I seen this too.
---
Happens all the Time in regular stores... I bought my TV for 900 Euros... now is 700 Euros... what can I do? Demand a  200 Euros refund?
---
Adrenaline is another consideration, under Agility.
---
Nerd Rage synergizes better with Bloodied, but is still very powerful.
---
I strongly recommend Batteries Included or Power User, depending on your playstyle. (BI if you use energy ammo other than for your pa, PU if you only use cores.)
---
all off them have it, or at least all the ones I have killed had it.
---
Wich is now a $350 mosin nagant.

/u/BethesdaReplied is a bot, tagging it won't do any good. You probably want to tag /u/ladydevann or /u/valseek :)
---
I have 2 weapons that never break. Traded em during heavy lag and they never decrease üëç
---
I had my camp in the Mire - right on top of the dam beside Harpers.
---
Two sloths along with babies spawned to the mountains side of the camp all the time and I defended those majestic, stinky looking creatures from hermit crabs, super mutants, rad toads and... ugh... I can't even remember. That camp was like a goddamn monster superhighway or something. Never camp there.
---
But yes, baby sloths :)
---
Me: wears hazmat suit in nuke zone - great
---
Me: keeps hazmat suit on then climbs into solid steel exo skeleton - wtf
---
Omg haha!
---
Sorry.. must have been really annoying
---
Don't finish the quest ever. Just get your pic and leave. Then you can farm it for the next challenge later.
---
I'm only getting 15% chance of a 3\* enemy to drop a 3\* item since P9.5.
---
Its an atom shop purchase.
---
Pretty sure it will be one of the new features... maybe in Nuclear Winter or Wastelanders
---
I can't access the keypad to the sub-area in the Arktos Labs (where you get Arica's shutdown codes)
---
well then go do something different take up tennis or bike riding perhaps video games are not your thing...golf is fun this time of year.
---
Done that. Fingers crossed it fixes though because ive been burning through my inert flux
---
also there's often dead deathclaws at the fissure sites . you don't have to kill the scorch beasts just healing salve and run. although i think moleminers are your best option.
---
God damn it really? I thought that was just a skin for the vending machines...
---
Yeah and renames it to the yellow, green etc... you can't choose the names.
---
Only way to indicate what each vending machine has is use small letters plan and write it out on each machine.
---
Was your TV a limited time, that day only item, supposedly never to be purchasable again?
---
I think you missed the point.
---
OK some dumb question of the day...how do you join a community?  thx
---
Their intelligence is between a supermutant and a feral ghoul, they aren't smart but they can still use guns
---
the greenhouse building set is in game several buildings use it and it's the exact same walls and roof from fallout 4 we just cant use them for some dumb reason
---
I have 100mbps internet split between an Ethernet-wired  PC and my Xbox on WiFi, with my Xbox tending to show 30-50 from speed tests. Never had lag problems on virtually any game.

If your at max caps, store your machine. Problem solved.

Now Bethesda can fix bugs.

I feel like the purpose of multiplayer Fallout is to partake in activities that are mutliplayer related. I would rather have them push for more challenging group content. Unless everyone rage quits, people who get through tough content together generally bond better. That is just my personal opinion. 
---
I guess the compromise would be to have some solo scaling or team oriented scaling, but then generally in most games, the solo option is better than the team option as people can easily rely on themselves more unless the team option gives better rewards. If they do that, i'd rather have the team option be more rewarding. Just my opinion.
---
Unfortunately, you have to go pick it up again. Amy can still be found at the ice creamery south of the highway bridge over Flatwoods.

what platform are you on?  I can help you out on PC.

Yeah i guess i could have worded that better.
---
Indeed you never finish it.
---
ya i figured that one out on October 30, 2018
---
A bit NW to Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast there are 2 Yao Guai among the train wrecks. Fissure sites have usually dead Yao Guai bodies with Acid on them.

Use voice chat, nobody is going to judge you for what you sound like, this isn't halo.
---
"Limited time" does not means "unique".
---
I know thats not fair, a discount should be given.
---
Ah darn, well thanks.
---
I've never experienced one complaint you guys post on here.  I'm almost convinced some of you are lying and are still on the hate bandwagon trying to make 76 look bad.
---
never trust an ad :-(
---
Exactly. Like I want to suppress my adrenal just to take a high step smh
---
Scorched actually wear different armor depending on where they are. At defiance they often where asylum uniforms, at morgantown airport they wear responder jumpsuits. Adding amor to them would spice things up, but definitely not power armor, because they aren't smart enough to use it
---
On the contrary. I think a good respec option would encourage people to continuously try out new builds and farm the appropriate gear...  that would be a very good reason to stick around Appalachia and keep playing.
---
The other Fallout games all have a beginning and an end. It makes sense to not offer players to freely change their perks, stats and skills there, because part of the fun is picking certain character traits and sticking with them. That's what adds replay value.
---
Fallout 76, however, has been designed to NOT have an end. You can't beat the game. You're supposed to keep hanging around. And the longer you play and the more time you invest into the game, the more punishing it gets to start over.
---
I can't count how many different characters I've created in the Fallout and Elder Scrolls games. But I would never ever create a second character in 76.
---
Precisely!
---
Are you focusing on a build? There's being under leveled, and then there's being under built.
---
I have the maxed out slugger perks, a level 2 incisor and a level 3 martial artist with one more space for packrat or something.
---
Burrows was great. Quest sucked. Good XP and loot. Not to mention the environment was amazing too.
---
The problem was Geforce Experiences Overlay\^\^  
---
And I don't want to play in windowed mode because it forces vsync.  
---
I have a 144hz monitor and need vsync disabled for gsync to work
---
I will try later
---
Same here.  Hell, it's cheaper to craft it yourself.
---
No problems with Biv here (XBOX). I get a tipsy taste test when ever I go see him.
---
Last time I did the fight, it was me and like 2 other guys actually fighting the thing then like 6 guys who were hiding in the shack.
---
see them all the time, they don't have a long life span.
---
Is there really any other type of party worth going to?
---
Yeahhh they gonna like bring some of this stuff back or?...when‚Äôs the red rocket sign coming back?
---
AAE auto handmade
---
I agreed. None of my friends want to purchase FO76 due to the rocky start, and finding friends is kind of hard.
---
A thing to remember is that FO76 is still quite inchoate and has several target audiences coming in from very different directions, with preferences and playstyles that don't mesh.  You've got the pre-FO4 crowd who have come in expecting a traditional Fallout experience; the FO4-first-and-onlys who want more of the Sim-like base-building qualities; the MMORPGers who are coming from games like WOW; and the Battle-Royalers looking for fresh PvP fodder with the same mechanics.  FO76 tries to offer something for all of these and more, but fails to do any of it perfectly.  In the process, it loses definition: just what kind of game IS it?
---
Don't get me wrong, I love this hot mess, but at the moment it's bitten off more than it can chew.  Until it establishes a more solid direction, puts its foot down, and says, 'Hey, here's what I'm about,' we're going to have a fractured playerbase running up against elements they didn't want or expect, then airing their frustrations about it.  It's not so much a case of people wanting Fallout to cater to them specifically, but for it to deliver their interpretation of what was promised.

I've been trying to tell people this for a while. It looks like the max damage is capped at ~70% of a Players Health Bar in one shot, making automatic Weapons OP. I can kill most players in 2-3 shots as long as their Serendepity and Dodgy play nice
---
Why the hell would the game not exist? ü§î 
---
Sounds more to me like you got mad at BurRthEsdA, deleted your account and now you‚Äôre like ‚Äúomg if this game even exists hur hur hur¬°‚Äù
---
Yup, add in dead man sprinting and squad manuavers, you have a speedy ass character
---
haven't seen the fast travel part but I've noticed that on a couple of group kill enemies I'm going to run up to the body the items start to disappear I'm pretty sure that's because the game made the mistake and tired yours and someone else's inventory up the scorchbeast together so why you were watching stuff disappear someone else's picking it up out of it
---
Ok. But just with armor right? Never seen that on a weapon.
---
Sniper build and am looking to the the Possum questline üëç
---
There is really no reason not to. More money for Bethesda, more options for groups of friends.
---
No, not with weapons as far as I know
---
Tipsy taste test works wasted on alcohol isn't a repeatable quest as far as I know
---
no it's just like free range you get "more" items from all 3 surviving not "better" so i would rather just focus on the one adn get it over with and on to the next
---
Don't know why this isn't a thing since it was available in the previous three titles. I'm gonna chalk it up to limited staff, resources, and the fact that they messed this game up (in more ways than one). 
---
In the meantime, I would check and see if this at least lessens the color problem:  [http://www.fallout76mods.com/category/pip-boy/](http://www.fallout76mods.com/category/pip-boy/)
---
Hell, Sheepsquatch is hard enough when half the group is just there to steal your junk when you die.
---
That will literally never happen. If you could just give away the things you buy, why would any more than one person ever have to buy them? 
---
If you want to gift your friend, give him the seven bucks.
---
If you are playing on Xbox I can be your new team mate

I just realised I didn‚Äôt mention which platform! I am on PS4...
---
Just use like critical savy or four leaf clover now
---
found ,if you approach from watoga side, in the bog, then the wire fence seems to hold them back (not always). I can pick them off (at distance), with sniper rifle, one at a time. VAT's wont go thru the fence, but I dont use that much anyway. Mrlk kings also spawn 6 there as well, same trick.
---
they foam at the mouth, but wont get past the fence.
---
had 3 deathclaws there too. Whack a mutant, and whack an beastie, and they kick off against each other. Fun to watch if nothing else.
---
Yeah, I'm so sorry for playing this game without reading guide and spoils. I feel so guilty for playing as a filthy casual.
---
It's funny you act like Bethesda has not known for false advertising.   did you forget about the vinyl bags that were supposed to be canvas, did you forget about the new ESO game where they said it came with the other two DLCs but when it was but didn't.  I could go on but those are two false advertising step Bethesda is working on right now.     and limited time doesn't mean that it will never be back again it just means it's only available for a limited time.  Kind of like how every year in May and June we can get grapes that taste like cotton candy in my area but they're only here for a limited time.
---
Maybe a good idea but there's no cause for another workbench. This can be a feature of the Tinkers

I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre password is ‚Äúpassword123!!‚Äù It could literally be anything and to me nothing is easy to guess

Come by my shop. Xbox after 6pm est. gt listerfeign. 1 cap per.
---
Change the color of your UI/PipBoy Screen? that'll be 2000 atoms please. /s
---
 it doesnt but u can use diluted rad x or rad shield
---
Discord is a great resource for this game, they have helped me out with a few things here and there.
---
Did you call the police?
---
Exactly!  Keep the group content coming but make it easy to get a group going in game.
---
Troubleshooter is 30% more damage against robots. Bloodied is like 400% more against everything.
---
You can build atom stuff in your friends camp. Outfits......  nope.
---
I mean they should change this non sense
---
Crazy idea since we actually do need global chat: **THE ABILITY TO TURN IN OFF** ü§Øü§Øü§Øü§Ø
---
Thanks, mate!
---
Hmmm idk about that I sometimes after I move my camp and rebuild it I have slightly more budget
---
rad shield is better anyhow
---
I have a level 1 tse pipe rifle that never breaks. Too bad it‚Äôs useless haha.
---
Here I was excited because I thought we were getting a winter season with an actual survival mode and not team death match.
---
It‚Äôs fucking battle royale üòë
---
No you get better. It came right from bethesda
---
I wish it was instanced. I dont mind queing up, if it meant id have a team to do it with
---
Most ‚Äúsales‚Äù are?
---
thats the same thing they said about free range they just mean "more"
---
These fuckers haven‚Äôt worked since 4 lol
---
For sale.  Gt listerfeign. After 6pm est.
---
If you're fast you can save the baby sloth I don't know if it's tameable as I never tried
---
There are some sub and dom prefixes
---
If and i say IF within some future update we get to see proper human NPCs then it would be great to be able to use the flare gun to call in a small squad of fighting NPC's depending on which faction you have most pull with. So you could call in some responders who managed to survive somehow or maybe brotherhood reinforcements....maybe some enclave bots.
---
It would make for interesting battles and if everyone fired a flare during a scorchbeast queen fight then it would be awesome to see a mass amounts of NPC's come charging over the hill like the Rohirrim in LoTR!
---
Make sure it registers in the top corner of the screen or it won't count when you take a picture
---
Limited time is equal to ‚Äúholiday weekend sale‚Äù  it‚Äôs ‚Äúdiscounted‚Äù for a short time but never stated it won‚Äôt be on sale again later.   
---
But since we know they brought back this paint set I‚Äôm sure everyone is eagerly waiting for blackbird to make it‚Äôs glorious comeback to the shop
---
Then prople would sell/trade atoms with each other and wouldn't buy them off bethesda
---
Rad-Xs are everywhere. Radshield is not
---
Disconnect? Nope no issues there
---
Freeze randomly (requiring restart/log off) or quit to desktop? Still a nuisance. Freezing has been much, much worse.
---
I'll try be on for then, how much do you charge
---
REEEEEEE
---
Assaultrons are among the toughest enemies in the game. You probably need to optimize your perks for damage with your preferred weapon, and also make sure to use Med-X, Psycho, etc to help deal more damage and take less. Even then, you'll probably get melted a couple of times without really good gear.
---
21+ days later, I needed this post. I don‚Äôt get a chance to play enough to know all the latest details, so ‚ÄúSearch Reddit‚Äù is my go to. 
---
Just know this helped at least one person, and I appreciate it.
---
How much you got?    Lol. Idk 25 caps I think.  I‚Äôll put 1 up for you.
---
Never got the mods for the club unless all 3 survive. And no I don't get 3 plans because they survive.   I don't think people fully understand the way RNG works. They think it's just a random set of number that it picks from not thinking about booster or other factors that can change the number.    none of the plans drop when you don't have all three survive.     You will get a bear arm but not the bear arm plan unless all three survive.  no one has gotten a stimpack diffuser or bear arms plan without having all three survive.
---
Yea, but i cant take advantage of the discount because i decided to buy it the first time around. So if i wanted to also buy the Pipboy skin, that would be a total of 2500 atoms for something new people, and others who didnt buy it last time, can get all 3 for 1800.
---
\-.- i thought this was an actual problem and then i noticed what the sign said....... touch√© my friend, touch√©!
---
Literally every single other website that looks at sales numbers. He'll they are selling the game for 3 pounds in Germany. So sales numbers are going to end up inflated due to that and then giving the game away free with ps4 controllers.
---
There is a reason the game is only 20$ less than 7 months after launch.
---
Do the campfire tales event at camp adams.
---
What a great Story! I was there with you! More of them please!
---
Thanks, I've been shafted getting the pemmican
---
The ole "Whitesprings doors" issue.
---
A proper bloodied build is far too overpowered atm, and everything else is underpowered. Some players can kill imposter sheepsquatch in under 30 seconds with bloodied, and sbq in under 3 minutes solo as well. They could nerf it by half and it would still be the strongest build, which says a lot.
---
Thank you for testing, translating, and sharing your results! Do you happen to have the results of the behemoth test handy? Seeing the results of these tests done on several different types of enemies would be more conclusive. Also, detailing which receiver with a critical bonus was used might be helpful even if the weapon doesn't have more than one available. Additionally, if you are on PC this mod may be helpful (ShowHealth Redux): [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/315](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/315).
---
If you swap out a perk card that currently isn't working as expected for a different perk card be sure to test again after each update. For that reason I operate under the assumption that they do work because otherwise it just adds to the extra work that I have to do after each update.
---
Sounds about right from a lot of the people in this sub if you don't ignore the constant bugs and screw ups by Bethesda. LOL
---
Np
---
And of course you get all the whiny people with their Assassin/Sentinel sets bitching about getting sniped screaming at you. Must be SO hard defending their OP advantage despite all the logical balance reasons to the contrary for removing the cap, buffing Power armor, etc...lol
---
You are getting down voted because people want their hands held all the time now.  They're incapable of finishing any mission without a waypoint pointing exactly where they need to go. You don't even need to read the quest or mission just follow the way points.
---
 Then if there's no way points they have to Google because doing something on their own is just plain unheard of.
---
They drop from campfire tales event
---
The game does exist and works just fine now? I play daily thanks for the aggression though. My only complaint was that limited time event awards are locked to characters not accounts. Which, as was the point of the thread, turns people off from starting over. Maybe calm down a little.
---
Instigating + two shot is not possible. Instigating + explosive is possible. Anyway AAE semi AK47 would be awesome, good luck with that.

There's been rumors of new weapon mods coming out with the next dlc release. It was leaked in actual game play when you would encounter enemies while playing  with either Italian, French, or German as your language setting.
---
They're not asking to give away their own things. They're asking for a way to *buy them* for others.
---
That truck is so dope! I would love to get one in rl and do this!
---
Whats your SPECIAL look like?  
---
Its quite possible you have a good build, but are using the wrong weapon(s) for that build
---
Dang, crazy lucky!
---
First aggro the sheapsquatch so it's not hitting the cows then use vats to take out the little things that are hard to hit on their own. If you have gun fu, you can wipe out all the weaker mobs in seconds after you aggro the sheapsquatch onto yourself. It's easy as pie if you're not melee. 
---
If you are melee it can get hairy but most times I've done it pretty easily on my 2 hander toon. Sometimes you just gotta pick one cow and keep it alive.
---
If i became a ghoul then i'd want the scorched, feral ghouls and super mutants to not agro unless attacked but suffer more damage from players and robot. Also take a small loss to charisma.
---
If i became a super mutant id want to add an extra 1/2 or 1/4 to my strength special but loose charisma, intelligence and agility. Also never be able to contract any disease and gain health from radiation.
---
"Ivan, why is your suppressor bright purple??" 
---
Is still shotgun, brother. What, you think I'm trying to hide?
---
I've seen him all over the place.  This spot in Whitesprings, in the Mire, the Ash Heap.  I was over level 100 before I saw him for the first time...I was seriously doubting he really existed.  Now I've killed him 3 times in the last 2 weeks.  You don't find him...he finds you!
---
No, you can't. Only the red stove which is likely a bug, and anything they already have unlocked in the atom shop. Workshops are a different story, but you don't keep those.
---
I knew it, i made a pist about that months ago, but the only response i got was: "NoPe, i HaVe 110% cRit DmG, bEtTeR CrItS wOrKs".

I test it again with robots in Vatoga. Use hardened receiver 38 pipe gun. Use perk which display resistance. Near the result:

---
As you can see mutation add much more damage then 3* perk card
---
Glad you got it figured out!
---
This is super interesting ... Furious testing round 3 will have to wait, back a bit later with  results.
---
no, just increase daily scrip limit.
---
I didn't check my inventory between events so I can't say for sure, but I just assume it was likely all three from the same event. I only did, I think, two in the region that day on that character.
---
I have been farming him since release, on and off. I always come back because he gives a decent variety of loot
---
Legendary enemies will heal themselves once they get to half health. That's normal for SBQ.
---
Sadly, so is getting fucked by crashes or disconnects :( sorry man
---
No because there are a few reasons for deliberately suppressing mutaions that would no longer be an option. Rad-x has alternatives.
---
I just learned it tonight and still doesn't get crafted. Annoying, when's it going to be gorram fixed.
---
Better crits doesn't woks correctly. I approve it. Maybe Bethesda fix it in future patch?
---
I noticed the last time I SBQ'd that nothing appeared in the drop but still got a POS 3 star armor like I picked it up, but the drop was completely empty even opening the transfer menu.
---
But the freezing has came back considerably. I'm playing adv like it's survival üòÇ. Watch that loot!
---
They are not going to make a majority of end game players builds worthless overnight. They will buff other builds to make them more comparable.
---
Link
---
I test furious. +5% damage per shot, stack 9 times :)
---
Completely agree. We aren't even talking about a nerf. Just fix the damn range. I have elasers too, I don't mind them in principal, but I don't want to be forced to use a weapon just because it's the only thing that can counter other people using it. Plus elaser vs elaser fights suck.
---
Fallout PvP outside of elasers is very well balanced and fun, Imo. It just sucks when you meet someone using an elaser, and you have to use one too, and the fight then turns into 300 meter 1 shot fest.
---
I hope soüëç
---
Yeah I know the legendary enemies heal it‚Äôs just it took us twenty minutes to get it that far so no one was happy about it. Everyone was pissed off so we got it down pretty quickly after it but it really sucks that my game crashed at the best moment :,). It‚Äôd be lovely if the next time I try after my soul heals I‚Äôd get the drops. If not then I guess I‚Äôll have ptsd from this event and avidly avoid it.
---
Maybe I should actually try farming him instead of just doing it whenever i log on lol.
---
Closer to $500, it was an M44 carbine.
---
As Bethesda hasn‚Äôt (to my knowledge) made a comment regarding the spawn point, we can only provide each other with information and make conclusions from that. I‚Äôm sure there are even exceptions to this common conclusion as the center may fall out of spawn points in locations such as cliffs. 
---
Without more information about your camp (location etc) or seeing it as a patron of your camp (not being your personal spawn point) i thank you for your comment :)
---
how bout you **git gud and stop dying** ^(/s)
---
What part of, "Why not let us gift atom shop items/clothing to our friends" (or the rest of the post for that matter) implies anything about gifting atoms? 
---
Please, I'll wait. 
---
Or maybe work on your own reading comprehension before bashing others for theirs.
---
Thank you :)
---
If you don't want to read guides, that is fine, but then don't complain it is too hard when you attempt the more aggressive challenges.
---
Yeah it's a weird confusing glitch for sure

I saw a squirrel outside yesterday I had to restrain from shooting it so I can take a picture for my tadpole scout badge.
---
If you can choose only one I believe that critical savvy benefits slower firing weapons more than four leaf clover. For rapid firing weapons or shotguns I believe that four leaf clover is more beneficial than critical savvy. An argument could be made for using both with the sniper rifle/handmade but only if it's not explosive (unless you choose to not use demolition expert in addition to the other types of explosives which I do not recommend).
---
You're hilarious. I've seen all the posts asking to give stuff away for free. It wasn't hard to tell this isn't one of those. It was the "they don't have money for atoms," implying this person wants to pay the cost.
---
I bought the game full price at launch and a few weeks later it went on sale for 30 bucks. It‚Äôs kind of like playing the stock market, don‚Äôt worry about what you could have gotten and just take what you got.
---
Sneak, tank killer, and rifleman
---
Emergency protocols makes power armor better than sentinel armor now after the nerfs for bloodied builds, at least in pve.I don't PvP much ,but it might be worth a try
---
Why would one need to suppress it?
---
Excellent post. Hope it gets more attention.
---
Yes I have, it‚Äôs still inferior. My luck is at 32. WS is better, West Tek can spawn 5 without a nuke. Why would I waste time if I can walk into west Tek and grab comparable loot and a good return on my bullets expended.
---
I shouldn‚Äôt have to nuke the location.
---
Or the cap limit.
---
could always start one my friend i would join :)
---
I end up soloing free range and paradise quite often actually. I even got a serum p recipe once. Farmed all sheep recipes too. It's doable easiy. Sbq and imposter meant to be group content I understand. I enjoy all content but pvp honestly. Solo but challenging content would be pretty much welcome.
---
I'll vote for bug.
---
  I was carrying around 10 pieces of technical data when I got the quest for the first time.
---
When I picked up the one they had marked, all of them I was carrying disappeared.
---
Try taking the picture if it is dead and you have the camera right above it. Had the same issue with the cat, rabbit and a few others. I had to take multiple pictures for it to trigger. Dead works best.
---
lever action with furious?
---
Apologies if I missed it, but is there a test of only the crit damage card without any other crit buffs?
---
This could tell us if it's the card itself that is bugged,or if the crit damage is already capped from eagle eyes
---
Only the worthy can pick up both no?
---
I shalloth write a novel!
---
I got the bear arm plan when only two survived. I've NEVER seen all 3 make it.
---
we dont need a special bench for bulking ammo. we can bulk junk and craft ammo at an already existing bench, it makes sense that bulking ammo would be at that bench too
---
Dude is known to be a fan of exploits and bugged weapons. You shouldn't bother with him
---
And at West Tek, I get about a thousand steel, 5 good legendary enemies and tons of gunpowder and xp, without needing a nuke or anything more than 3 mins.
---
As far as i know it's a encounter between 3 yao guai and Mommy sloth with her 3 little cuties... They have no chance.
---
I was down voted for saying maybe Bethesda could fix their bugs as a joke. Someone(or more) didn't think it was funny. I wouldn't play any Bethesda game if I was truly worried about all the bugs.
---
Unmarked pond up near Solomon's Pond. One is there, always.
---
spend 2hours checking other players camps, best way to lose caps.
---
If you get black screens like this often, lower the core/memory frequency of your videocard by 50-100 MHz. Somehow, the Fo4/Fo76 engine likes to overdrive the videocard which then shuts itself down as a safety measure.
---
OK, I spent a lot of time drinking and playing fallout last month, it could have been me. was I snoring into the mic, walking against the side of your building?
---
Pipboy -&gt; Status -&gt; S.P.E.C.I.A.L. tab. It will show your current stats for the special points only. This includes mutations, perk bonuses, buffs and armors.
---
So the point of the post was supposed to be implied, not through the language of the post itself,  ut through your particular lenses of perception when you arnt the author? 
---
Sure. Again, point to this "obvious" language.
---
This works well: if you can place it, you can enter it.
---
It is a great game, there are problems but it is getting better. I have played since Beta and I still love it. They have come a long way and it is a ton of fun :)
---
You can only turn in/carry one TD at a time once you get the quest for the very first time.
---
Before the first initial turn in, you can hold as many as you want, but once you get the quest, the first time it will "eat" all your TDs on turn in. From then on, you can only hold 1 TD at a time. You can pick up as many as you want, but each one overwrites the next.
---
Safest thing to do (assuming you have never turned on in at all) is to drop them on the ground in front of the turn in point, pull one out, turn in, pull another out, turn in, etc.
---
There are a few places that will spawn multiples, once I see there are 4 or 5 in an area, I just FT back-n-forth turning in each one solo.
---
Was it implied that if you didnt buy the game when you did, that you wouldnt be able to later?
---
LMAO! I love it!!
---
Just buy an FO76 atoms gift card and text/email your friend the code.
---
Agreed, well I lost 800 caps on something I have no idea what was purchased? I checked my inventory and I did not get the item I wanted and my caps are gone... :(
---
First round of test results incoming.  
---
Method:  
---
ShowHealth Redux mod to see mob health.  
---
I swapped some perk cards out 'till my rifle was at exactly 100 displayed damage. Tank killer off. Rifle is 50% armor pen. Hardened reciever, not crit reciever.
---
Used the usual super mutant behemoth for the test. Crippled the legs, then recorded with OBS while firing. Repeated hit-hit-crit 3 times with Better Criticals equipped, 4 times without. Then slowed down the video and checked health values before and after the crits.  
---
With Better Crits active:  
---
208 / 207 / 208  
---
Without Better Crits active:  
---
171 / 172 / 172 / 172  
---
Notice I have the Eagles Eyes mutation, so this should be the difference between 290% weapon damage and 250% weapon damage.
---
Will try using rad-x to supress eagle eyes, and give it another go. Results incoming.
---
I ment the bear arms mod plans. They are really rare.
---
Is the word *gift* foreign to you? Have you ever heard of Steam?
---
Except at any given moment, you could buy that tv and/or an xbox. It was implied that i would not be able to purchase these items if i did not do so at the time i did. There was an underlying pressure to purchase at that time.
---
They don‚Äôt stack, sorry.
---
Did the same thing, same results. So that's good. Tried doing some tests with target switching the other day, and results didn't seem consitent. So that needs another round.
---
Most recipies and plans can be found at random locations all over the map.
---
Or 
---
They can be bought from a number of vendors, either NPC or players.
---
All the faction vendors are inside whitesprings, so I'd start there.
---
A few can only be obtained by completing events.
---
Take all those 1\*s you don;t like to the legendary exchange machine at any train station and turn them in for script, then visit MRgph in berkley springs.
---
cant wait for the 4 horsemen skins to come back
---
Nvm, my mate didn't tell me he had 15 of them. Sorry üòÇ
---
go down from welch. should be ore on the ground. or other replys are sound.
---
question - do you wish to earn it, or just get it anyhow. ? my pref. is to earn....but
---
ps4 got loads, i'm almost at the point of dumping it. how much do you  need ?
---
late GMT, (11 ish)  name's on the reply without 601
---
When was that implied? Limited time not One time only
---
&gt; Apologies if I missed it, but is there a test of only the crit damage card without any other crit buffs?
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; This could tell us if it's the card itself that is bugged,or if the crit damage is already capped from eagle eyes
---
I posted 3 comments of crit dough in the comments, somewhere here
---
Limited time doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll never post again. You had to assume it would come back later.
---
Shouldn't priorise in maxing melee damage perks, it's a waste of space and time since there are serums for that, just get level 1 for each and max them after you hit higher levels.
---
Tho Incisor should be maxed asap if you run melee.
---
I have a spare gun and sword. PS4 user name csmit69
---
Wait ‚Äúlimited time‚Äù and ‚Äúone time only‚Äù don‚Äôt mean the same thing üò±
---
Cool, hopefully this helps! I only mentioned more testing, detail, and data because it is always good for helping to not only prove a point but also more importantly track down the source of the issue so it can be fixed. That is, of course, if they don't already know about it. I'd be surprised if they didn't already know about it. At the very least those of us that use this card and read this web site can now temporarily use a different perk card. Now that's exciting so thanks again!
---
It's just straight up funny to encounter something like that every now and then. I hope it stays a rarity.
---
Your just bad. Made a new character had him at level 65 in a weeks. Don‚Äôt know why you expect to be end game level any sooner than that
---
pricing, like camps, is all over the map :)
---
Exactly this.
---
Not true. My buddy built me a ton of atom stuff.
---
Odd I've been in West Tech a few times and only manage to find one ledgendary and he is always in the same area. I must be missing something. I'll try a run through again tonight to see if things are different.
---
High agility and perception only damage perks and sneak perks
---
This sounds like user error.
---
Better dead than red!
---
Or just increase script limit
---
Dumb idiot I am. Blimey.
---
Because not everyone gets perfect rolls
---
Thanks for being helpful :) cheers dude.
---
No you are not under-levelled
---
It's just your weapons.
---
Get a decent 2 handed melee, hotkey your stimpacks, you should kill it in no time.
---
Should i assume, yea? What other limited item has returned?
---
I‚Äôm awkward, antisocial, have a hard time making friends. And used to be solo on this game 99% of the time until I met someone equally as awkward and antisocial who was having trouble with stuff. 
---
I helped him out with a few things, quests, carry weight issues.
---
Long story short I don‚Äôt care to meet new people. But you never know who you might find. 
---
And I gotta say, there‚Äôs a lot of aspects of the game that are more fun when u got someone to share it with.
---
I do those events quite regularly so If you need help with any of them feel free to add me? U don‚Äôt need to feel obligated to be sociable. I completely understand. 
---
But I will be there if u need a hand.
---
PSN same as username.
---
Same goes for whoever reads this.
---
I see now,thank you. Awesome data to have,thanks again!
---
Troubleshooters.  
---
Even better if you have the 2 hand melee perks + bloody mess active.
---
So is this where us old guys get together to talk about our trailers and fallout? maybe we need a LAN party, BBQ and rally... lol
---
Im happy that next month Ill have our 19'bh paid off!
---
TBH I would spend cash to have that fallout camper blueprinted with basic crafting, that I can move around the map. I appreciate my top of the world restaurant layout, but with a large footprint, it doesn't transplant well.
---
&gt; can't for the life of me understand why high capacity reduces energy and rad resist
---
Is this true? why that's a downgrade not an upgrade!!
---
Not a fan of aae weapons have a few and they‚Äôre just garbage compare to a be or bffr weapon. You can pick up a be handmade for like 10k I‚Äôd recommend just going bloodied
---
I wish they‚Äôd show legendary items for sale in the inspect camp on the map.
---
flair guns: Makes a WOOOOOO sound when fired
---
yup but i know you can see stats there, was mainly looking for a way to see if for example there was a valuable difference between 16 and 18 points in strength
---
I recently encountered an Assaultron fighting a Cave Cricket. I thought it would be fun to cripple the Assaultron's legs, whereupon it continued to talk a good fight from a prone position. I stood smugly and safely on top of a freight carriage watching the skirmish below!
---
Id go with PS4 over PC due to the bigger player base and no hackers/modders etc
---
Armorer's Workbench. Craft and scrap low level cheap armor with Scrapper &amp; Super Duper.
---
Oh okay, thanks for your thoughtful input fuckface.
---
allowing us to send atoms or something yo a friend through gifting would be great. surely gifting would be a part of this new Appalachia were building
---
Oh okay, yeah, it's MY fault. Sure. Good job.
---
Crafting, for a start. Higher int means better condition on crafted items and class freak only reduces symptoms by 75%. It makes a difference if crafting cores and you have marsupial. I've also used rad-x when slightly overencumbered to supress strength debuffs to enable fast travel.
---
Or if he can't do it ... look for me next.
---
PC "FarPlace"
---
Sorry that you are salty *and* bad at the game at the same time, bud.
---
I had those on when i smelted iron ore. I have 1200 steel now lol
---
Well i‚Äôm glad you have an acid farming method that you find works for you then. I personally like the yields I get from the 3 extractors from Hemlock but I could understand why you feel that particular strategy isn‚Äôt worth your time.
---
Doubt it
---
Its best to jump servers after killing him, will be faster than waiting for respawn.
---
No such thing as far as I know. But you can test it with a friend. And by leveling up more than 5 chars only perks bring noticeable changes in your stats.
---
And THATS the reason why i skip it tbh.
---
You collect every password/holo/note X times and hoard it in inventory but THAT one you have to collect every time again - after running through the whole forest from one end to the other to collect the holos.
---
And follow up to this one ... turns out I been avoiding using rad-x for no reason, all mutations are still active. Well doh, TIL :)  
---
Exact same results, still 208 dmg/crit with Better Crits, 172 without.
---
Unfortunately you can only use that to track the number of the "sub challenges" you've done for each Scout challenge. Would  be great if it was a bit more granular.
---
Mate, as an outsider opinion. Your being a jerk
---
sweeten those with mr sandman, evade thingy,glow sight,bloody mess etc. all can be swapped in or out as req.
---
keep saying this, tailor your cards to suit YOU and YOUR style of play, not the other way round. No-one can answer this question for you.
---
Spiffy yeah I been featured on a few videos myself for building..I build trap bases and stuff to actually add to the zaniness of the fallout world I currently have a maze build and I have vendors outside Incase players don‚Äôt want to play.. I‚Äôm using if you would like to check it out my PSN is Walking_Contra
---
Dick Shale disagree.
---
I was using an example, not just melee.
---
This UI bug caused by non 16:9 aspect ratio. My friend with 16:10 resolution have this bug, when others and me personally with 16:9 - not. As I can see, you have 16:10, so just report it to bethesda, so they can fix it in future update.
---
In a workshop maybe.
---
This has been asked for since the game came out. Why they haven't done it when planters are already in the game, nobody knows but Bethesda.
---
Your on one of their list now. That's why they keep coming for you. They know!
---
This would be great. I doubt that they would implement casings and primer like in new vegas. But we could at least break them into gunpowder lead and steel so we would be able to craft other calibers.
---
If you don‚Äôt like the game then ok. Fallouts always had bugs and grinding is kind of a part of rpgs. It‚Äôs just not your game it‚Äôs fine
---
Given how akward crops are to place at times and how much of a budget killer they can be this should be a no brainer. Functional versions of the little ones on East Mountain lookout would be amazing.
---
Cause a Mothman's party is mandatory.
---
You GTFO  that you whine about the mechanics, don't want to fight, go pacifist or suffer.
---
Workshops are part of PVP, and you need to be inside the zone now to enter PVP with the contender, they fixed it on last patch.
---
If you have the right mutations and class freak, the special increased should outdo the spacial decreased.
---
And even just your shielded vault suit adds 4 int, 1 int from marsupial is nearly nothing.
---
\&gt;things that are out of my reach
---
Are you talking flying things like SB's?  or just anything out of arms reach, even if on the ground?
---
Are you anywhere near a weight limit?
---
There was a [mechanics test post recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bt9phg/mechanics_test_furious_weapon_affix/). There are indications that the Explosive splash effect can reset the furious effect if it hits another target or the ground.
---
What really grinds my gears is that I can carry more outside of PA than while wearing  it.
---
Given the way armor works in this game, the actual value of damage increases more and more, the higher up you go.  
---
Example:  
---
100 dmg / 100 resist = 50 damage to health  
---
150 dmg / 100 resist = 86,97 damage to health (+36,97)  
---
200 dmg / 100 resist = 128,81 damage to health (+41,84)    
---
The scaling isn't linear, since the odd armor/resistance formula makes higher damage values "pierce" armor.
---
So it actually makes sense that the test with both mutation and perk card gives a much larger increase. If you do one test with only mutation and one with only perk, they should be much closer. Just kind of expensive to turn mutations off/on :-/
---
All I remember is Todd Howard saying at E3 that this game could still be played solo. It seems like they are forgetting that when making new content.
---
Yeah, mostly for getting scorchbeasts and cargobots to stop flying about. I can make allowances for my carry weight.
---
Its a multiplayer game...
---
for 3000 caps, you can buy even the overpriced 3* shit at player vendors. Just buy that
---
And this card is chewing up 1/3 of my Luck points. Grrr.
---
Yeah it can be tough with a new character around certain points. But I was able to finish tadpole's dailies since level 15, first encounter with the Imposter Sheepsquatch on level 22 and currently leveling up every 30 minutes with the correct events on level 32. I git the mutations and siting on 250 scrip.
---
Story will be done after level 45 when I am able to get some of the rewards already maxed, because they are better than crafting.
---
FYI the mobs in The Forest and Toxic valley regions don't scale with people, excluding some events.
---
https://playcrazygame.com/2019/05/26/the-who-recognizes-video-game-addiction-as-a-real-disease/
---
also in the savage divide just south of the wendigo cave there is a lead deposit right close to a top side cliff hut with a stocked garden. just south again from there is an airstream camper. both un-tagged locations.
---
last night  I tried to plant my CAMP up there, but it blocked me at every turn when the lead deposit was within my camp border to farm. F-you Bethesda
---
Sounds interesting I just might pop on by next time I'm online.
---
I could do all of that. Or, I could just pop a rad-x.
---
Do you have more then one smores plan?
---
Perk cards should have been based on stats, and not just level since the beginning. I still don't understand why they made it this way. They completely invalidated any reason for those of us who like crafting, to craft.
---
The SBQ event is a lot of fun and l‚Äôll participate from time to time because it‚Äôs something different and it is a challenge.  Most of the time it‚Äôs other higher level players that do their part and you can usually strike up a good conversation if that‚Äôs your thing.
---
wat? exp nerf pretty much only affected glowing ones. diversify your exp hunt outside of "lol WS nuke."
---
spongeyness hasn't been changed unless you last played pre tse nerf. 68 mutants still take me 8 rounds to kill with my non min/max build.
---
bugs: there have been so many bug fixes, way to cherry pick but ignore the many game breakers that have been fixed.  are there still bugs? yes. are they stupidly gamebreaking like old ones? no
---
Yeah I have a machine filled with quest related apparel and I kind of feel bad when higher levels travel there.  At least my fusion cores are cheap
---
Exactly why I havent done the quest I  spend hours just looking for markers trying to figure out wtf to do.
---
Level 100 and you can't do free range solo?
---
I think there's logic to retain legendaries, and the server will re-distribute legendaries to meat piles / corpses / non-legendary mobs if someone logs out without claiming the legendary drop.
---
Last night I was in Whitesprings golf course in one of the bottom rooms (the ones with the golf outfits), there were 4 ghouls there, none were legendary, killed all 4, got interrupted in my playing, came back a couple of minutes later and 3 had 1 star legendary items in the loot drop (none flashed at the initial kill).
---
Yeah. Evreytime i open the game lol
---
It's jump, but also the same key to register a crit in VATS.  The timing is weird because I have jumped, pressed swing, and missed my target and lost my crit. I know because I enter in vats and my bank is at 0%
---
No.  In my camp.  I‚Äôll take pictures later. On Xbox.
---
That‚Äôs just east of Flatwoods, by the picture of a chicken
---
Because they introduced the disease concept before they thought out PA availability and necessity in the game. Then only at the 11th hour did they realize that by the time your high enough level to be using your PA in every major fight, you'd never get sick again, thus defeating that game mechanic completely.   
---
So rather then re-balance the game, rethink the disease system or come up with an explanation, they just made it so PA doesn't protect you from disease.   
---
Because fuck lore right?
---
keeping up with the roadmap seems to be the only real priority.. even above balance and bug fixes...
---
I know the feeling from Destiny. I still don't know why developers do that.
---
It was entertaining to watch, I'd love to see more of these CAMP reviews.  
---
Small feedback: I wouldn't call it the "style of MTV's cribs", because it didn't really feel anything like cribs except for the music.
---
Skipped it for a while, but reached a point where, if I'm playing on the main quest or another big quest, the enemies are just punching holes through my Marine armor for some reason. Only the PA makes me durable enough to finish the damned quest.   
---
So it depends on where I'm playing and what I'm doing.
---
No, why would it be?
---
The language of the post implies this gift to be the outfit itself. Again, you can't point to another sentence, word, or even comma that implies otherwise. 
---
Steam has literally nothing to do with the post either. You cant imply the intent of someone else using your own interjected outside experiences. 
---
Why is that so hard to understand?
---
Pretty sure that got patched out.
---
The bigger the better
---
And the harder they fall
---
With 3\* legendary's for us all.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs ridiculous I have a set and stay still, and I still get demolished even after a few it‚Äôs, smh
---
as a long time camper owner, I still hate my popup 5 years after selling it. l would never recommend anyone to buy a canvas top camper. moved on to a larder travel trailer... one weekend a month when were lucky... march to November... sun or snow.
---
I don‚Äôt run a bloodied build (do have a couple of nice bloodied legendaries though) but I agree enough with the nerfs already.  I know that‚Äôs not the intent of the post, but I also know Bethesda likely looks at sites and comments from players to make changes.  Clearly that‚Äôs what they did with the explosive nerfs.  I think there should be more buffing.  Power armor (even ultracite) should stand up a little more to certain weapons.   I still think some rifles (other than Gauss) and heavy weapons are underpowered.   A few other armor types as well.
---
Just like my uncle
---
Cool yeah it‚Äôs totally up to the player lol I don‚Äôt force my maze but it‚Äôs fun watching people go through it
---
This was just a test episode. Originally it was going to be just me reviewing CAMPS but after making the first episode I kinda wanna cheesy up the intro a little. I dunno things always change and develop when trying to get something off the ground but thanks for the input.
---
[I use something like this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=7c445bd&amp;d=sa0sg2pd2pk2e82c72i11ic2a72a81lb0lr2l11pp1pl2lt2a02e00a31lv1s50si0sj0l71ar0pe0&amp;w=p80p90c51i30ia0ij0i40iq0at0lm2p00pa0&amp;n=&amp;m=8c)
---
non auto rifles with a little bit of melee for backup
---
Yeah I can agree with this or call it Wasteland cribs and put your own spin on it lol be obnoxious with it and be like you seee this rad showerrrrerr üòÇ
---
Okay, you're a strange one. Say OP decides to comment and clarify the exceptionally obvious for you, what then?
---
I don't have any, I only got 3 smores from my friend
---
Nawh, why would you want that? Just show those noobs you are king, who did all challenges!
---
You can in fact play the story quests and generally the majority of the game solo. It was not promised that there will be no multiplayer exclusive content at all, [this article](https://www.gameinformer.com/2018/09/04/the-new-wasteland-what-to-expect-from-fallout-76#tocitem-2) from a few months before release actually clearly states that events will be multiplayer focused, and that "most can't be completed solo".
---
Focus on doing dmg. Perks that raise dmg , NOT perks that make food spoil slower and lockpicking perks like lots of people do . Then they ask why they dont get  loot from SBQ or can kill anything
---
Would you happen to have the Marsupial recipe for sale on PS4?
---
That one I didn‚Äôt haven‚Äôt any trouble with.
---
But I want to show of the bos logo on my jumpsuit lol
---
I think its less better odds on the rolls, and more you're rolling the dice more often
---
so yes, effectively better odds.
---
If you want to force people to wait until more show up, can't you just go hit E/ Use on the downstairs computer and sit at the menu? Only one person can use terminals at a time, right?
---
You don't have to do much, just bring your vault suit.
---
Popping Rad-X for 1 less int deduction is plain stupid while wearing your suit gets you 4 int, and mentats get you 2 more.
---
Waiting for the time to let it pass to enjoy your mutations again is just not worth it.
---
My favorite moment so far was watching a SB from a distance that got into a fight with some robots.  Out of nowhere a mirelurk queen showed up and took them all on.  It was my own kaiju flick
---
Some of the gold paint weapon skins.
---
Well they have the skins, and more are coming. That should help will pairing to outfits. It‚Äôs a sacrifice you make by getting the utility of equipping the backpack, I like some things the power armor gives/used to give over non PA but don‚Äôt like the look 24/7 so I just didn‚Äôt use it. Other option don‚Äôt use 3rd person and you‚Äôll never see it üôÉ haha
---
This is hilarious!!!!
---
Alpha is very meta one-shoring players and shit.
---
Two days ago I saw a table fan at my company and wanted to grab immediately...
---
That's deep, Instigating is one of the best prefixes for a crossbow! But yeah you're right it's all virtual, same thing I told myself yesterday. Plus you can always probably find someone on one of the trading subs who has what you're looking for if you need it that badly.
---
We could use some giant birds.
---
My method exactly.  Enclave bunker desks.  Find one, see if there's another, remember which desk that's it, fast travel to turn the one I have in, fast travel back (17 caps each way), lather, rinse, repeat.  Just got Paladin paint with this method.  One more to go.
---
So far most backpacks are meh at best and look weird with no straps lol
---
I suggest you look at the "for a limited time" McRib sandwich and ask yourself how often it has returned for a limited time.
---
My buddy just filled my camp space up Sunday. He thought it was funny. Skull statues and atomic lamps.  A lot of lamps.
---
I have a feeling the perk card system was a weird compromise of not wanting to lock people into builds while at the same time making one if the only choices we can make about are character mean something(stat points) ultimately giving us multiple levels of cards so we can have some control over our builds growth instead of a more passive growth
---
What system are you on?  I play on xbox.
---
Last weeks mole miner backpack is definitely my favorite. It‚Äôs pretty small compared to the others so it doesn‚Äôt take over your entire back. I can see straps on my backpacks.. I‚Äôm 99% positive at least
---
When you inspect it shows straps but not when equipped
---
The DR formula is the #1 reason I suggested more detail and the mod ShowHealth Redux. Results can give the wrong impression depending on several factors, one of which you detailed nicely.
---
As a stealth riflemen I mainly run a 2* instigating FFR handmade and it's the only weapon I use.  One shot supers with it.  I have run this since I first found the gun months ago.
---
Then I will agree with the author 100%. Because that is a clarification of intent. 
---
Why is logical comprehension of written language strange?
---
Lol. Okay. My 4 characters all leveled over 100 means I obviously haven't played enough right? Or the near thousand hours I've put into playing since beta means I need to play more right?
---
Maybe don't conform to a bloodied/unyielding build like the most of the community does. I have a melee character and he does just fine damage wise without having to run any unyielding or bloodied modifiers, and yes he does utilize radicool.  
---
I mean holy shit how egotistical do you have to be to assume that you know more about the game by using one super common build? Any one can Google. You guys can downvote all you want but it doesnt change the fact that you're running into issues created by your own choices. 
---
Stop carrying so much weight, I know your armor doesnt weigh that much and and your weapons shouldn't be that much either. That brings it to aid, misc, junk, and ammo weight. Learn to manage it better before you tell someone their lack of knowledge is showing. I mean how fucking narcissistic. 
---
My main, a heavy gunner that doesn't use either one of the legendary effects you described dies once in a blue moon. I shred through just about anything. Hell I can solo Free Range and usually prefer too.
---
Maybe take your own advice and try different builds and things out in the game instead of sitting on the internet bitching about your own poor  choices
---
This might be right, but for example in silo, multiple people can use terminals at same time.
---
Yea, great comparison.
---
that would be nice... I solo'd a silo other day and when people finally showed up at the queen - time was almost up and she poofed.
---
But I checked last night after I bought some new outfits. I‚Äôll check again later today. Is it the tadpole backpack or all of them your taking about?
---
The problem I see is with the TSE nerf and shotgun build specifically the enforcer perk (stagger) becomes far less effective in survival mode.  
---
When I play in adventure mode my AAE combat shotgun and full shotty perks + full adrenaline + full enforcer+ full tank killer is devastating even against most that want to PVP. 
---
In Survival, to keep up I have to ditch the shotgun build and PA and really move toward a stealth rifle build just to compete.  I‚Äôve been pretty effective but against some of the bloodied builds I can (and have) been overmatched depending on what armor they are running.
---
I know. I really really really want to enjoy this game. I want to make an unarmed build so bad. But DAMMIT its not like I can just keep a bucket near by and just continually vomit while playing
---
I have 4 different ones and none have straps when equipped
---
Wait..  what? That's much simpler than hiding and chipping away from cover with a silenced 10mm for three days. I wish I had known.
---
Just happened to me.  Looted my friend's workshop before teamed up.  Realized you can't see player vendors on the map while wanted!!! Asked to be killed, bam!  Vendors visible again.
---
Your response to the analogy is not exactly right. At any time you could purchase a power armor paint (the equivalent of a TV in general) but you are talking about a specific paint that is past initial release and this on sale since (the equivalent of last seasons TV going on sale).
---
We need a "looking for group" radio channel, like the Hunter/Hunted radio.
---
I did it at a imposter sheepsquash event. Guy who i revived wasnt my teammate and it counted.
---
Maybe try asking where to grind levels as a low level player? The game isn't broken you're just farming the wrong areas. 
---
Exp nerfs happened a very long time ago and that was pretty much just the ridiculously high exp from glowing ones.
---
You can find it in the reddit markets occasionally for 4-6k.
---
I don't even know if they still drop from Forest events anymore. I farmed hundreds of events, for weeks, and finally just bought one.
---
If the man wants to finger bang...LET HIM FINGER BANG AT CLOSE RANGE
---
Must be a helluva stinger to get through all that ultracite and black titanium ;)
---
The repellent isn't bad; it doesn't negate all damage, of course, but it does a fair job
---
Run a 30+ charisma build, it affects legendary spawns.
---
nah, he doesn't need to work on him because he doesn't want to play with other people. there is nothing wrong with a person that would rather relax and play on their own time with themselves.
---
I am not 100% certain the stealth perks and mods are working correctly all the time.  My survival character is purely a stealth set up with all corresponding perks and just this weekend I was spotted a couple of times pretty easily (even at a distance) so maybe something is glitching.
---
No.
---
 I'll give it a go.
---
How did you manage to get 16 possum badges? Farming the daily scout quests? I‚Äôve done 7 of the possum badge challenges, but the rest of the seem almost unachievable at the moment or bugged and definitely unachievable.
---
Camp logs off when you do.
---
Grinding from what I've seen.   
---
Finish main quest, grind out events/dungeons again and again to farm legendaries. Get tons of extra crap you want to sell in the process. Repeat.  
---
The biggest complaint I've heard from the hard core players (those who've stuck with it after the initial launch, despite the game's issues) is that there's no real post main quest content. After killing the scorchqueen, it's just rinse and repeat.
---
I understand that the guy just wants advice, but generally speaking I so agree with this. Once the game is reduced to calculations of DPS, it loses all joy for me
---
Build top end gaming PC, buy a 2nd account. Now you're never alone and have infinite stash space and can do all kinds of crazy things! Like having your mule afk sleeping at his base and sharing 5/5 adrenaline perk due to his 15 charisma, along with Strange In Numbers boosted Empath for 31% extra damage reduction. 
---
I'm mostly kidding, because I realize this isn't a solution for most people, but it really is how I deal with being a solo player in this game lol.
---
There never was a trade exploit. That was a hoax.
---
Who's complaining man. I'm saying it's hard for a solo player and that the list of achievement is overwhelming for casuals.
---
Also I don't think we should HAVE to read a guide/spoilers to be able to play a game. Sorry but I don't like to be hand-guided through everything.
---
You will not get loot if you dont do enough damage. My group has been killing her for months and that's how it goes.
---
Day 1: leave Vault 76. 
---
Day 2: Got gank rolled by 4 lvl 60's with explosive weapons, while I was killing molerats. Slowly fading as they take turns teabagging me into oblivion.
---
The end.
---
Should be riveting :)
---
I dont think it should be free..
---
it would make a good cap sink.. go to some robot somewhere and pay some amount per point.. maybe like 500-1000c...
---
If you move your camp unit around, the spawn location moves, too, regardless of where you originally placed it. You can try this yourself. I had to play with mine a bit to get it to spawn people right by my front door. In my case, my camp unit is on a foundation in the middle of the pond behind my house, because that's just what ended up working.
---
Your responses to my issue arent exactly right, but im tired of trying to get my point across. I had 24 hours to decide if i wanted something i was under the impression might not return, or at least not for a while. Now people have a whole week, an extra item, and a cheaper price. And if i were to decide now to get the extra item, id still spend quite a bit more than anyone purchasing now. 
---
Also, no one has confirmed if these items are a permanent fix to the shop or not
---
Aye do I have some CAMPs for you :)

I have three that haven‚Äôt been on the internet yet including a strip club, airport, and a sort of trap maze thing with many trap mechanics no one has seen yet :)
---
I had the same problem in Heart of the Enemy quest. 
---
I had to travel to Fort Defiance and find the password to the terminal. With the password I was able to turn the power on.
---
YMMV tho.
---
Nice low lvl deathclaw. Kill, loot, jump server, and repeat.
---
You sure can, and it will run on Atoms. Mark my words.
---
What system are you on?  I have a weight reduced berserk 50 cal machine gun with 50% bonus dmg in vats.
---
They're never going to do this. It would defeat the purpose of the atom shop.
---
I am not sure about the permanency, not at my game right now. However, my feeling is that limited time items will return every now and then for a limited time.
---
I am a melee build, with only a couple of perks for rifles, and none for heavy weapons.
---
I've taken down a number of L50 SBs, cargobots, and vertibirds with a 1\* executioners combat rifle.  
---
It works, but takes about 200 shots to take down L50 SBs and their scorched entourage.  It barely scratched an L65 SB.
---
for the L65, a 1\* AA LMG was faster.  IDK how many rounds it took.
---
I've only run across one L80, that one I took down with a 1\* troubleshooters gatling.
---
Recently acquired a 50 cal auto, but have not had the opportunity to try it out.
---
Cheers thanks for the further information. (Not being cunty, I really appreciate it). 
---
Haven‚Äôt found this with my last 2 bases (always move the box after placement) but would be something to investigate further :)
---
fish harder
---
I love PA in adventure mode because it‚Äôs just so practical.  I can carry a lot of shit, take a lot of damage (relatively speaking), and it holds up well against the elements including nuke zones.
---
I rarely run my PA in survival mode because you become so much easier to detect and the added defensive benefits are really offset by your opponents and their builds.
---
for what it's worth: https://bethesda.net/en/article/2G2vLPyPwcMaiGASUwsoqQ/fallout-76-official-reveal-e3-2018
---
this is from the official reveal trailer. the only reason I decided to try beta - it says multiple times "play solo or band together"; "journey alone or with friends"; "go it alone or with friends"  this is talking about all content including a paragraph about launching nukes. a
---
almost all vanilla content can carefully be done solo (Queen is tricky but back way back near release it was done) but some of the new events launched (sheepsquatch stuff) are hard (free range) alone or impossible (cryptid).
---
it seems intentional they added event content based on needing other people to make it succeed (cryptid) and for people told "do it alone or with friends - you choose" this sucks. 
---
especially with no new content for a solo player seemingly coming... some people may not get time to play with groups and some may not want to and that's fine.
---
Ive done those all multiple times and never got a badge so i quit doing them.
---
It‚Äôs triggering. You just have to get his attention sometimes as he‚Äôs rather intoxicated. Did it yesterday.
---
I have just modded a hunting rifle, but shall keep an eye out for some legendaries.
---
Its not even close. When fallout came out probably 2/3 of my friends list was playing fallout and i played and add new people making it close to 3/4...now there is 1 maybe 2. And the trade forums on reddit are dead compared to what they use to be. Servers were full before and servers are full now but my guess is theres not as many servers
---
I'm sorry this was so difficult for you.
---
Off the top here are my suggestions
---
Remove 
---
Portable Power - not worth the 3 points to reduce from 10lbs to 3lbs. 
---
Power User - with player vending out now, you will never run out of fusion cores
---
Adamantium Skeleton - as a PA user you will rarely damage limbs
---
Add in Adrenaline. It‚Äôs great when you are in the thick of it
---
Add in Life Giver. Self explanatory. 
---
Here is the build I was running before moving to a bloodied Build
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f455b88&amp;d=s42ss2sm2se2sn2pe2c72cr0i44a04l71lt2lu2ee2p10ih2i12as2eu0&amp;w=&amp;n=2hMelee&amp;m=2389cdefh
---
The reason for enforcer is to cripple big mobs such as deathclaws and behemoths.
---
Also a walking tank that can get one shotted pretty easily in survival mode by the sents/cavs. 
---
Not being critical of those types of armors as I have a sent armor set I use in survival by I can‚Äôt believe how ineffective PA is even with full dodgy and chems and other defensive perks engaged.
---
For Heart of the Enemy, I had to cancel it, server hop, and restart the whole thing again.  Visiting Fort Defiance and doing the steps in order.  For me I had to do the quest in one run, without breaks, or it messed up.
---
Since then i get the Heart of the Enemy daily reminder every time I go to the Cranberry Bog...
---
Depends on what you have, what you want, what type of weapon or armor you are going for, and stash space. Everyone wants that heavy weapon with the 90% weight reduction third star. That's incredibly useful, and well worth trying for. Melee builds want that strength bonus. VATS builds want that 25% less VATS cost. And if you plan on re-selling things you get that you don't want, and have to have them in your stash or inventory till the scrip refreshes the next day, 3 star weapons are the way to go. 40 scrip per item. Doesn't take more than a few of them to cover the next day's scrip cap. Why would you want 30 1 star weapons in your stash box to save for that 150 scrip when you can do the same with three 3 star items and a couple for change? Stick with the three star items. If you get a god roll and it doesn't fit your build you can go trade it for an equivalent weapon of a different type that does on the Reddit market. 3 star is the way to go.
---
This is exactly right. Same with the camera quest line. They were designed with new players in mind to give them tasks to achieve as they play the rest of the game normally, not 100+ level characters with nothing else to do.
---
I need 36 for the Mining Miracles quest.
---
Woah.. we got a speller. Clear the room guys!
---
How so? Just gifting your friends some oitfits would defeat the purpose of atom shop in what way? 
---
Im not saying you can gice your friend atoms, im saying that you can use your atoms to gift you friends sone cool atom shop stuff.
---
Why is cap limit a bad idea?
---
But if they make it easy to solo, we‚Äôll stop begging our friends to go buy the game and play with us üôÑ
---
who won. cause that cricket can still get you.
---
i hate , I Hate , I HATE....peter pa......cave crickets
---
watched high level deathclaw and glowing bear, go at it hammer and tongs for 10min. bear won.  says bear "did you enjoy the show ? now there's a little matter concerning your entrance fee ! "
---
'tis the little things.
---
I think there is a perk card that reduce the explosive dmg you get. Fireproof its name if my memory serves correct.
---
Imagine getting on the internet just to go a forum to bitch about the game you apparently like to play. 
---
Imagine bitching about an extremely niche issue created by poor choices of gameplay to conform to a meta build that every one else is using. 
---
Imagine thinking you know more than everyone else because you know how to post on a forum and use Google. 
---
When you post here and it's just a complaint, you are obviously fishing for gratification that you're right in your complaint. But that's not always true and I domt have to coddle OP.
---
‚ô•
---
Only take team perks if you have friends to actively play with.  There isn't matchmaking and asking strangers to play doesn't work out that well.
---
Camps can't be destroyed by players unless you're in PVP with them now, plus when you log off the camp disappears, so it's safe
---
I think I read somebody say it was a 25% chance to get a badge. Also, you have to have been promoted to possum to be able to earn badges. This wasnt always the case and as a tadpole you could earn possum badges from them, but Bethesda patched that out.
---
The journal will be two lines long.
---
\&gt; high level spawning: did you ever stop to realise maybe you are to low of a level to be &gt; at the questpoint you are at? 
---
Spawning changed with patch 9.5 - The Forest, which used to spawn only low level enemies regardless of who was around....now scales.
---
Nu.
---
I honestly just wish they'd make utility perk cards cost nothing to equip, Lock Picking and Hacking are two prime examples, no one runs them unless they have to and its annoying to switch cards in and out just to use the perk for all of 30 seconds before switching right back.
---
More like: day 1, leave the Vault. Day 1, got ganked outside of the Vault. The end.
---
I have over 100 scrap.  There‚Äôs a mineable spot SE of the ISS cabin.
---
I waited at the quest giver bot and killed myself with a grenade after the other player finished talking.
---
Thankfully he got the idea, revived me and proceeded to blow himself up too
---
Ahh now I can agree in peace.
---
I find I can reliably get 3\* crap weapons for 1,000 caps or less, which I've done a few times on my old character, who has lots of caps but I don't use them anymore.
---
Gatling gun is much stronger per shot. Explosive damage is just 20% of the base weapon's damage, up to 32% with max demolitions expert. Stronger per-bullet damage on the gun = stronger explosion
---
I gave him a day to get to lvl 5. At 1k hours, I figure he's wise enough to not get ganked by a team invite exploit.
---
the offer is there....cost you nothing. more fun to earn it tho.
---
interesting idea.. a tiny little area paint
---
Are you sure that's not just power attack?
---
Yeah. Sometimes I just want to get it done. The times when I've played along with people doing this maximizing games, they kept using OP weapons and one-shotting everything (including the wendigo) so it wasn't benefitting me at all. I just stopped killing stuff and played an instrument to end it.
---
Is true
---
I've only ever used the TSE Combat Rifle which I got fairly recently. Killed myself pretty easily without power armor until I got a dense chest mod. Do you have one of those or have you changed your armor since getting the handmade?
---
No way? It does? I have not visited the forrest in 318 levels lol. Need to go back there
---
Great advice. Thanks. You're right, Adrenaline is way to good to pass up. 
---
What is the 'bloodied build" if you don't mind me asking?
---
IMO; outside Pa with a Dense chest mod, you wouldn't notice the splash damage. Check if your chest piece has a dense mod.
---
PA will take a bigger hit when using E weapons.
---
True, true.
---
I kind of like it too. Everyone gets to see how much time I wasted on that ridiculous quest line, but it's a good feel.
---
Thanks for testing. It looks like Better Criticals joins Grim Reaper's Sprint as perk cards that don't do anything.
---
Will have to run Four Leaf Clover at 3 instead.
---
Has anything been done to test the +50% crit damage legendary effect?
---
Are you related to Rosy?  :P
---
What? I'm saying that we would spend our Atoms to gift our friends outfits and other stuff from the Atom shop. I'm not talking about any trading stuff.
---
Why? I kill the SBQ solo using only 2 or 3 diluted stimpacks, and that's far harder. I don't think I took a single hit doing the new event so far. Some people optimize their characters. I love it. "I'm not good enough to do this, so no one else possibly could be either".
---
I'm sorry. What was so difficult for me? 
---
I understand your point. You seem to be the one having difficulty understanding mine.
---
Correct.
---
whats the point of one shotting in pvp, its supposed to be epic fights, not death from behind the bushes
---
Karma saying you were not ready for this powerful weapon!
---
Well that kinda sucks about the team perks. That was a waste then. And that's good with the camps. I'll have to figure out how to go into a pvp server.
---
Question: what type of armor were you wearing? sent/ass regular mix or PA?
---
Clarified the post.
---
That‚Äôs why one shooting things kills the fun for me, good read!
---
I have no mutations, no god roll weapons, no blooded,etc.
---
I get by just fine. a little better would be nice, but a lot more.........
---
well.......nah. happy enough where I am. each to their own.
---
Hmm most of my time is spent there. And even on an empty server the mobs will not be above level 10 on specific places even if I am the only one roaming the area. Only specific events cause them to scale.
---
I bet my 2 caps, that in Deathclaw island you will spawn a level 21 DC.
---
Sounds like a fo nuzlocke lol
---
It looks silly when you sit down too- always intersecting with your chair. Not giving up the carry wieght for anything though!
---
OMG I had heard of  **Forza Horizon 4**... I thought this was a real truck at first. lol!! Still very cool.
---
How lazy are we as a society that we can‚Äôt read fewer than 1000 words...
---
To have fun.  To help.
---
I mean, clearly, the intended design is for multiple players to sit there and play instruments to summon the Wendigo, not stand there for 25 minutes finding small waves of Charred Ghouls.  Getting it done quickly is the default expectation.  You don't get to storm in after the fact, turn off the jukebox, and stab everyone playing instruments because they aren't playing the Event the way *you* want to play it.
---
Now, if you're the first one there, feel free to enforce your will on everyone else.  But if a group is already doing it a particular way, then no, this doesn't "work both ways."
---
easy 60 gig. I had to buy an external drive.
---
the disc itself usless, apart from, it needs to be inserted
---
Do you want some cheese to go with your whine?
---
Then maybe you should stop dropping it? Sometimes I forgot how it's called in inventory and get rid of it, but it only happened 3 times this month. All other days I was using same note with password and everything was okay.
---
I would say "just next time you got to the body memorize the note name, it's called ...", but seems that I have forgot it already. Again.
---
Actually nothing very PvP meta. Bolstering, unyielding, chameleon and exterminator lol
---
My girlfriend uses it to put on a fireworks display over my adjacent camp. It's pretty cool
---
Ive been on may different worlds and have never seen the Campfire tales event spawn.
---
Needed the recepie for Smores I ended up getting it off another player.
---
was it in the patchnotes cause i have yet to see it. im between arktos and the mine in the forest, at arktos i have nothing but level 1-7's. at the mine 1-6 scorched. at the tent spawnpoint at the acid extractor its normally L5 muties, L5 protectrons, or L3/6 scorched while im lvl 132. when i visit WV lumber its all level 5's. thr boss is the highest ive seen at 16
---
between bolton and top of world you may be picking up savage divide spawn tables.
---
I like the way it is now.. I just wish it was easier to swap for crafting...
---
i'm down with this, all my friends kinda gave up on the game and im just getting back into it, it's pretty lonely now. there's the little lounge/lobby area right beside all the vendors. got chairs n tables to hang out at, could be a good space.
---
This is sort of a stupid question to anyone who can answer it, but what's the point of Adamantium Skeleton?
---
In PvE, I've rarely had to deal with limb cripples.  I've heard that Rank 3 supposedly prevents you from being staggered outright, but the SBQ certainly does for me.
---
LOL
---
Like in Fallout 4.
---
Sorry I went to bed right when you posted this, if you still need help today let me know.
---
Well there you go. 
---
It still won't happen because if people are able to use freely earned atoms to give to anybody then all those people with thousands of unused atoms because they don't care for anything in the shop will start to sell them for real world money- therefore taking money out of Bethesda's pocket. 
---
Or, at the very least, Bethesda will see it as someone with extra atoms giving them to someone who may have used real money to buy them otherwise. Either way they lose and since they are the ones that impliment policy, they arnt going to hurt themselves. 
---
It's not like you can't gift your friend some atoms. Just hand them 10 bucks. Or jump on their system and buy a few for them. It's not all that complicated.
---
It‚Äôs really helpful if we can plan and organize when we aren‚Äôt in game. Or even lets us buy sell and trade in the app!
---
cool, cheers, might take you up on that offer.  I still need the swimmer badge and some of the trophies, hopefully see you in game.
---
This mentality makes for some of the more entertaining r/hfy posts.
---
Coward
---
That's a really neat idea! Thank you for sharing this!.
---
Well im asking because the pipboy skin is, so id be a bit miffed if the other skins were now all of a sudden permanent.
---
Before you drop a nuke make sure the server is somewhat stable. If you're getting more lag than usual you should jump servers before doing queen.
---
I see it on a few builds across the interwebs. I think people who only have 3 points in END pick it because the other 3 Star END perks are ok. I don't really get it either. Hence why I through this build together so that someone can answer that for me. haha!
---
What kind are you offering?
---
Oh I didn't realize it was on the known issues list. Haven't checked it in a while.
---
Hey there, it appears the inconsistencies are large. 
---
So you are right, items do not count as regeneration (even though they provide health), but some perks do. Photosynthetic works inside of combat, and I assume other regeneration perks work as well. Otherwise the mutation ONLY provides healing outside of combat, whether you have regenerating armor or not. 
---
None of this is clear in the game, and one would think all healing is amplified 3x. But it's definitely good to note that if you have this mutation, you apparently don't need regenerating armor at all, it does a better job of healing and operates mainly only in the same capacity (out of combat).
---
Something what makes whitesprings a place what is nice to go to to meat people or use it as a shopping mall
---
Belly has been the best for me with rifles
---
Bloodied weapons give you a major damage increase for running around with low health 20% or under. You can have weapons in the 1000's of damage per hit but if the lawn sprinklers at White Spring turn on you will die. ( a low level mole rat can kill you trust me I know from experience)
---
Yeah, there is probably some overlap there between players who are needlessly aggressive about doing the event *their way* and players who don't share Legendary kills in the first place.
---
Hey, after doing some research, it turns out I was wrong. I replied to another comment here, but basically items and armor don't affect the healing of this mutation at all. Some perks can, though, and ghoulish may be one of them.
---
That broken deluxe camera is a regular spawn now, not even necessary to find it on a dead tourist. I've seen it in regular monster loot, especially ghouls, as well as containers.
---
You're not supposed to keep bulked items. Its assumed you either bulked them to sell or you bought them to use. Bulked junk doesn't weigh less.
---
I know my Discord 76 team is sick of the event, but for different reasons. We all crash whenever we go do the event. Something is broken there that can cause every single person in Project Paradise to CTD. I love doing the event, but I just don't have the patience to get half way through it, CTD, reload back in, wait for the damn elevator button to spawn in (why does it take so long, Bethesda?), go down the elevator, start up the quest... and just CTD all over again.
---
It's discouraging.
---
I think I should be able to load syringers with rad x to disable players mutations in Survival.
---
The flatwoods monster is an alien
---
I would love the missile launcher to do a reasonable dps.
---
I have a maxed out Strength of 15 currently. I have under armour that brings it up to 17. My melee damage and carry weight have increased, so I believe the answer is yes.
---
Why are you carrying bulk scrap on you?
---
I'd love to buy and sell but it doesn't seem like they'll do that. Even if they start small with an item viewing app it's a start.
---
Because power armor isn't nearly as powerful as the lore says.  We should be laughing in the face of small arms fire and backhanding missiles out of the air.  Instead, we get wrecked by cave crickets.
---
If you take atoms that you accumulate for free and give them to someone who could potentially spend real life money on them, than you are taking (potential) money out of Bethesdad's pocket. 
---
If you are talking about atoms bought with real money than you can already do that. Just buy your buddy $10 worth of atoms. It's pretty simple
---
I thought that issue was just me. It's so annoying to load in and get ready to shoot, aim, FIR.... Reloading...FIRE oh wait he has moved and now have to re-aim.
---
It's not just Hunting rifles, but all kinds of rifles.
---
 Crazy how the simplest implementation of an idea is usually the best
---
 I am actually a barbarian who almost always keeps his spear out. However, I'm civilized enough to thank you for this information.
---
Then why are there like 3 pluses by the weight when your about to craft them? I assumed that was the whole point, so they took up less inventory/stash space
---
Lol melee players all f**ked.
---
You're overcomplicating it by making it use earned atoms. Make gifts a purchase only and it's a win win for Bethesda and people who want to gift their friends stuff. If the rationale behind not doing is "everyone would have everything" that means someone paid for it, and that wouldn't deter a business.
---
I didn't repeat experiments to prove my results to 100%, but +50% vats crit +40% better criticals DOES NOT STACK. I had a level 30 black power pistol that should have outdamaged my bloodied when used to crit. Alas in a game where you're encouraged to collect as many buffs and advantages as possible, more often than not the buffs do not work with eachother.
---
The ammo just gets unloaded. You dont lose any ammo. When you log off with 5 loaded and you log in, it gets put back in your reserves. Why, idk. Maybe it's a bug, but you dont lose any
---
Post an LFG (looking for group) here or on r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
You'll find other players
---
The best bit is that if you close it instead of signing in, when you re-open it, you will already be signed in!
---
in a game where there is annoying mutations, one hit weapons and invincible/invisible armor builds. I'm gonna pass real hard on PVP. No weapon balance is a recipe for griefing
---
Bethesda just wants us to recycle all the plastic in the wasteland the more bulked items get scrapped the more plastic we pick up.
---
I dont always I put it in my stash
---
What does the junk one give?
---
Yeah that's why it's called adventure mode and not survival. Because it's not considered survival by anyone.
---
The old Occam's razor solution
---
3rd test (other two are in this thread as well):  
---
Rifle with 100 damage including perks. 50% armor pen.  
---
Target: lvl 50 Behemoth. 150 DR / 75 after armor pen.  
---
A: Crit with Eagle Eyes (+125%)
---
B: Crit with Eagle Eyes + Better Criticals (+165%)
---
C: Crit with Eagle Eyes + Better Criticals + Overdrive (+180% and a 15% damage boost)
---
Test | Calculated | Tested
---
----------|------------|------------
---
A | 168 | 172
---
B | 210 | 208
---
C | 274 | 251  
---
So ... that's annyingly inconclusive. Better criticals is adding damage as expected, but with overdrive it looks like either the crit boost OR the generic damage boost isn't kicking in. Every test leads to a new, huh?
---
Wow I didn‚Äôt realize it was such a rare weapon! I‚Äôm on a long drive out west but I‚Äôll definitely give this thing a try when I get settled, thanks!
---
after a week of trying, there is a sequence to the daily heart of the enemy.
---
dna - anytime
---
1. fort defiance- re-read terminal and password note.
---
2. uni - terminal, power, terminal, centifuge
---
if you lose server,glitch, anything,  .... then its all down the tubes.
---
for me, its only completed once, due to above issues, but..... my method is sound.
---
Really? Even with heavy weapons? I thought PA would be required for heavy weapons because of stabilized
---
That's not my rationale at all. 
---
I'm saying they won't do it because it takes potential money out of their pocket by being able to gift free atoms. 
---
If you want to buy the atoms for your friend, you can do that now. Every gas station, supermarket, and even hardware store sells giftcards that you can give e to your friend.
---
Link to what? Them giving the game away with controllers? https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/anisli/gamestop_giving_away_fallout_76_with_used/
---
Or the selling them for 20 bucks now new?  https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bu3wx0/psa_fo76_1999_on_newegg_xbox_and_ps/
---
That doesn't help the sale figures if they are literally giving them away due to having way too much in stock expecting it to sell well, then finding out it isn't selling well at all. So they end up giving it away to clear storage space.
---
yeah I find it stupid you can't sell modded backpacks
---
My 10mm is always empty when I log in as well.
---
I agree with this. In my exp, AA is very overrated, probably good for some PvP, but i'll stick with my BE weapons.
---
They are by far the best in game.  I use BE lever for all but big fights.  I use BE handy for mobs, and BE heavies for SBQ and a few other tough creatures, but i could easily get by w/o the heavies.
---
Dear diary, today I left the vau...
---
West Tek is boring tho.
---
To be honest there will probably be a bos themed backpack sooner or later
---
Right. 
---
But no, it would be way better for the programmers to take their time coding in an arbitrary sharing system instead of getting rid of existing bugs or adding new content.
---
&gt;I also don't like bloodied build so my damage is basically useless against lvl 100 toxic diseased glowing legendary a-holes.
---
FWIW, carry a shotgun with the enforcer perk. I can solo just about anything by staggering it with repeated blasts. For extra credit get each of the 3 shotgun perks, just 1 in each, and it'll up your damage 30%. If you've get an explosive shotgun with the demolition perk maxed nothing will stand in your way. Get some decent armor with the dense mod and you are a serious tank!
---
1 cap per is acceptable for shotgun shells
---
Are the 3* drops any better in survival? Asking for a friend.
---
So your logic is that first to the event gets to control how it works? Even though if someone is farming it, someone else, like minded of you, can just show up and end it quickly. But that's okay though right? Because they ended it quickly, but if you show up to farm then it's not okay. 
---
Sure. 
---
Since there's no actual rules like this enforced, I think people will continue to do whatever they want. Most being uninformed and just showing up and ending the event. Because they are truly the ones who dont respect others people's wishes.
---
It's just gun safe storage practices.
---
Please let me tag enemies for Artillery! I build it because of the minute men, but it‚Äôs so often useless
---
Bulk lead and aluminum are the only ones that save space I believe.
---
How are you getting 30+ on at least 3 different special stats?
---
Hope so
---
Rug glitch+ empty planters and you can make them yourself.
---
Cave Crickets can be a handful. I called a halt to proceedings as they seemed to be dragging it out and I was keen to collect my winnings! I find the wasteland has so much of interest. By contrast I played HZD before it and couldn't wait to get my platinum and leave, such was my detachment and disinterest in the world.
---
It's been a thing since launch. It weighs a little less while it's in your inventory if you have pack rat active. But in your stash the only bulked items that weigh significantly less are aluminum and oil
---
Yeah 16 times the tents
---
bulked junk does weigh less. not by much but I can clear a few pounds by bulking.
---
bulk contains the junk + plastic, thats why it scraps to 'scrap'
---
Yeah there definitely need to be some balances. Marsupial mutation for example needs some bigger cons. -4 INT it‚Äôs not punishing enough for what that mutation brings. 
---
Other legendaries needs some buffs as well. Junkie‚Äôs for example deserves a higher damage output per addiction, suppressor needs a buff as well etc.
---
I have a bloodied super sledge and I think an instigating fire axe could you provide a build for the stealth unarmed? I‚Äôve never done stealth before
---
You should immediately travel to vault 76 entrance and take a selfie of yourself and the dead queen, that‚Äôll be epic.
---
Put it in your stash then. Sounds a lot easier than Bethesda making a *seemingly* simple change that's been built into the engine.
---
I know but why would they differentiate between the two?
---
https://i.imgur.com/VPDP3ml.jpg
---
No kidding?
---
I would have imagined that Betheada would put fixing such an obvious leak in their income potential right at the tip of their list.
---
I once spent an hour wandering Woodlands with a friend looking for a flat woods monster. Gave up, traveled to my camp and the cheeky bastard was hovering on the cliff outside it. Daisycutter to the face.
---
Was there another excavator power armor Responder skin leaked alongside this one a while back?
---
I would love them to be similar to the flare guns in MHW, and maybe you could get rewards to answering a flare like 200xp or 30caps or even a  small chance at a legendary
---
The change is minuscule. Not worth the lost plastic unless you want to sell it.
---
Yes, I use the engineer outfit that has a tank on the back, it looks terrible with the backpack overlaying the tank....
---
I think I tried that during Fasnacht
---
I mean they are adding new content and I‚Äôm sure an actual swarm of bugs will follow suit
---
Idk probably future content
---
But taking a pic of the flatwoods monster crosses off both
---
He was talking about the items friend, not the currency
---
Try Bloodied if you are already used to be killed alot. I made the switch from a power armor melee build and I really enjoy the bloodied build I can 1 shot everything in White Spring with my bloodier handmade.
---
Have to agree with that. And now that backpacks are a thing, even the carry weight bonus of modded power armor is beatable. It's disgraceful.
---
It's typical for all Ammo using weapons, you don't lose the ammo, it just unloads everything when you log off.
---
The other issue is interruption of the loading sequence, anything that interrupts the loading sequence before it's 100% complete will leave you with a completely unloaded weapon, this includes getting hit, or using a stimpak, and makes it hard to defend yourself when getting mobbed.
---
That‚Äôs the Chick-fil-A cow
---
I experienced almost the same yesterday. Claiming the workshop for the survival challenge was awesome!
---
yeah, Paradise is a bad name...more like project Paradox.  Its a fun event when you have lots of people playing it, but I've had serious crashes with it. One crash was so bad, my Ps4 became unresponsive, and I had to pull the power on it! was very concerned i might lose the console.  It came back up, but really? Im always afraid that will happen again, so, i dont do that even often.
---
I went to survival mode and was #2 on the server... lol
---
You can put them away or have them ready to go, what's the purpose of this?
---
day one issue, last equipped weapons will have no or reduced ammo in the clip,and 2nd weapon will have unequiped...........mostly.
---
on plus side........wot else you gonna do while your camps slowly forming around you,and the mutants are already in the wire
---
prep,prep,prep
---
I'm saying make it so you can buy people atoms. Not give your own earned atoms like I think OP wants. Yes, you can go get physical and digital codes, but instead of dealing with a third party they could simply add a feature to the shop to let you gift atoms to people directly.
---
Cool insights! Like a lot of others I don‚Äôt want to bother until there‚Äôs a bit more balance, but it sounds like a lot of potential for fun.
---
is that "sole survivor" a BE lever? I've found the explosive affect does reduce condition more quickly.
---
I don‚Äôt know why people downvoted you, yes you only need to take good care of one friendly not all three. And no the reward is not tied to the number of friendlies stayed alive. Best loot I‚Äôve got from that event so far is a three star armor when only one stingwing was alive. Other times there were more than one team and more survivors but it was only a wood piece or nocturnal tire iron. It‚Äôs RNG from a pool of crappy loot just like all other bosses like SBQ and Imposter sheep.
---
No. But only so there is some tradeoff. 
---
Use the easy to find radx, get suppressed mutations, put minimal effort in to craft radshield, not suppressed. There should be some payoff for putting actual effort into play.
---
Of course. Its Bethesda. What's your point? 
---
The company only has so many man hours to spend on this game.
---
It works with the flatwoods monster due to lore and code. Real lore says that theres an alien thats seen there irl. But also they took the code from the Zetans and shoved it quite literally into the flatwoods monster.
---
Someone got a pic of whats inside the helm and its literally the model of a zetan with short legs so they could fit it inside the bodies frame dimensions.
---
Lore wise i would assume theyre gonna start with the zetan additions at the crashed space station, like maybe it wasnt the apocalypse that downed it
---
Watching the behaviour of marsupials in some events I think it's much worse than -4 INT.
---
Use the Fireproof perk in Endurance, and it won't matter if you are in or out of PA, as stated in another comment, a Dense Torso Mod on armor chest also negates the explosive damage.
---
Fireproof perk, and dense chest mod can make you 95% impervious to explosive damage.
---
Well this stinks. Also kind of glad to free up a card slot though. Thank you for this!
---
Aww pc too bad
---
thought about that, but I also  thought I was too far out....Camp is at the T intersection of the road that runs between monongah and the bottom of the ToTW lift line - the intersecting road goes to Bolton greens.
---
I had walked from WS  to my camp via the Forest, not the divide.  Went too far west, walked by bolton to get to camp.  The L48 mutants were around all the abandoned military vehicles just to the east of bolton.
---
Did camp type stuff for an hour, nothing spawned/attacked camp.  Then headed to Morgantown station.
---
hit the high level ghouls on the way - don't recall which side of bolton they were on.
---
Over the weekend, had been in camp for an hour, nothing spawned.
---
An L16 stopped to visit my vending machine.  when he left, started hearing shots.   
---
He was being attacked by multiple L30+ ghouls at the edge of my camp boundary.
---
BTW, I do agree with your other point that OP may be in areas he's shouldn't be/is not ready for.  Then again, as you no doubt remember, Roses quest will take you places a low level should not be.
---
I'd go for 2\* until you have your mains weapons sorted. If you're just going for GG items for trading, then you can focus on 3s.
---
Probably comes down to damage per shot. My Explosive LMG with all Heavy Gunner perks and Demolition Expert does 89 damage per shot, it can kill me just as quickly as it can kill enemies, it's crazy.
---
Nah, it's a Assassin's Lever with +10% damage and +50 DR while aiming 
---
Being a non-explosive probably has something to do with it
---
it is possible with 8, but each person has to be on board to finish the event and not try to tag the alphas,
---
I get u tho...in general, the best u can do is 1 habitat.
---
Not remotely the point of the post, yes we can all read the summary notes but it‚Äôs just nice to have a bit more direct interaction between devs and the community, them showing us that they are looking into our suggestions, that they are fixing the bugs we have highlighted and that they are seeing the praise we give them for improving the game.
---
So many other games have done this and it‚Äôs about the communication between the game and the gamers, not the lack of willingness to read.
---
Ever since they implemented the wasted on nuka shine quest the challenges have always had at least one challenge that is literally impossible to complete. This isn't the first time they had the "take a picture of aliens" only last time the flatwoods monster didn't count towards it and it was looking specifically for Zetan aliens which weren't even in the game.
---
9 points in perception for rifle or commando perks. Handmades are awesome for ranged stealth play. My second character is a Bloodied stealth player. You can use your strength points for melee when you have to do close quarters combat.
---
Seems if I trigger it from the personal terminal it works, if I go to him to start it (or the two Scout dailies) they don't even show the interact option on screen, though you can hit it &amp; they'll just talk for ages.
---
Do you really want them to use their limited man hours to code, impliment, and then fix what will inevitably be a buggy ass mess just so you don't have to take 30 extra seconds out of your day?
---
I would prefer they spend that time fixing all of the already pre-existing bugs and making new content.
---
I said it only activates outside of combat. Its not in the description of the mutation but it's pretty obvious how it works once you acquire it. It would be super op to have 300% regen from stimpaks and other perks while fighting.
---
That‚Äôs weird yeah.
---

---
This is the build I was planning on making.
---
Are you running an armor piece with the "dense" mod? Since you said you switched from PA to regular armor, PA doesn't have a "dense" mod for it so you may have it on the armor you are running which cuts explosive damage you take.
---
There are a lot of quests and if you bothered to read those notes you would get the story too.
---
I have those perks and would kill for an explosive shotgun but I've yet to see one. But yeah enforcer is what gets me through a lot of my more difficult encounters if I can keep up on the ammo.
---
They just happen to run into an alien fighting a player every time!
---
Sorry no solo content as this is another great amazing super duper pvp extravaganza battle royal. 
---
Seriously though I wish we had more soloable content.
---
Anger
---
That's what flare funs are for.
---
I liked hiding over vault 76 when I saw a lvl 2 coming out, and giving them an impromptu fireworks display to celebrate.
---
They have a cash shop already. If they can add repair kits it would not be that hard to add an item you buy that awards someone atoms when they use it.
---
Sorry for your losses. I did get a nice picture of him standing next to a black cat that wandered in my base. üòÜ
---
The atom shop is the funding mechanism for fallout 76. It's how they intend to keep future content free.
---
You really don't see how being able to give atom shop stuff away takes away from that?
---
Meat people? That's how you get wendigos.
---
Can confirm
---
&gt; but Bethesda patched that out.
---
And that was when uit doing the tadpole line. I ain't got time to do the world challenges. Running those two once a day was sufficient for me.
---
Junkies is already one of the top weapons in the meta right now after the TSE shotgun nerf last week. With it you can get a boost of 50% more damage without having to run low life like a bloodied build.
---
Antiseptic
---
It honestly makes no sense why it shouldn't be in the game. If anything it just stunts creativity. Not like food or crop growing is currently a problem. I personally want to grow MORE variety of crops on top of having crop planters.
---
No problem homie
---
This is a really fun show and I can't wait for more episodes
---
If you're on PC, I'd be glad to help. I just tried again and found him in the same spot after 10 hops [https://imgur.com/et4aN76](https://imgur.com/et4aN76). He shows as a level 21 [https://imgur.com/et4aN76](https://imgur.com/et4aN76)
---
Will never happen, with how unstable the servers already are the last thing they need are third party API requests bogging them down even more. Hell they can't even handle big CAMP builds, let alone a bunch of programs asking for player inventory information. It is why we can't even have more than 800lbs of stash.
---
It spawns when someone enters the area at night (after 10PM?  Maybe later).  Seemed like 100% chance if it hadn't already spawned earlier.  
---
I farmed it quite a bit for badges for the high capacity backpack.
---
I was surprised we can't get plans for that from project paradise. looks like bethesda keeping it for vault 94. This vault is all about indoor plants
---
I love gun skins, it‚Äôs hugely fun in other shooting games. Each new one makes me want to play more just to enjoy the fresh look. Thank goodness Bethesda doesn‚Äôt understand this, or I‚Äôll be getting loans to buy their gun skins. Please Bethesda don‚Äôt add anything more, everyone is using fatman and lever action, what you currently have is more than enough.
---
There's a mod on pc that does that
---
I've once built a house where the entrance was basically in the first floor. On the floor below, I've build an entire garden. That was pretty nice because I love the thought of having an impenetrable fortress that is totally able to sustain itself in case of war.
---
Ironically, I've built it out of wood lmao.
---
Oh, so do you just soak up a bunch of rads and run around bashing in faces?
---
if only you were on PC , i have like 4 of them that i cant sell even for 50 caps lol
---
It doesn‚Äôt stop bullets.  You still take damage when you get shot!
---
Because they were originally planning on selling the perk card "packs" for Atoms long before the game came out. So basically the perk system is a legacy of that idea.
---
Do you have anything to support that claim about Grim Reaper's Sprint? From the research I've done it seems that it works but doesn't have a notification like some other perks.
---
Its a common bug of all kind of rifles. Remember to equip a melee weapon before leaving (dont know if you loose ammo)
---
Here you go, much easier with this mod: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124
---
Only takes like 3 seconds to swap every card out for crafting perks instead.
---
I couldn't either! Ended up making a "feature" out of the new bits!
---
I'm not a coder. Are you? 
---
Something tells me though that adding in a feature to link cash transactions between players (when they have constant problems with messing up the friend list with unrelated content patches) is a little more difficult then someone spending 5 minuets at the keyboard. 
---
Look, I'm not saying it's a bad idea. But the thing is with good ideas is that, from a realistic real world standpoint, a lot of them (if not most by a long margin) are just not feasible to implement. 
---
Especially when you take into account the fact we are talking about a mega corporation where the bottom line rules with an iron fist. If there is already a way to get the results that is required, they arn't going to spend a single cent to make a redundant way to do it again. It's just not I  their interest. Like at all.
---
Noted! Thanks for the feedback :)
---
The skulls are actually bugged too, forgot about those, but what lamps are they? Because I think I have all the atom shop lights and I've never been able to build one for someone else.
---
I got several PA skins but after realizing how weak PAs are compared to magical legendary armors, I stopped buying them.
---
I feel this. My cousin is currently seeking asylum in Germany and hasn't been able to log on in a couple weeks. I would've loved to purchase the Plague Doctor mask for her as she's been wanting the mask to be in the game since BETA. Sad that it's gone now :-(
---
Crybaby Jack ;-)
---
One of my characters has his camp there, extracting lead. You just cant place too close to the edge of the cliff above the hut.

Damn son, are you lost? This post is ancient in terms of the internet. And no as stated in this post slap damage served a purpose, and it still does. I love shooting people who are using vending machines. They pop out of them to see who the hell shot them, then I can use it!
---
I encountered only one 3 star legendary mr. gutsy in one hour of gameplay and it dropped me a two shot radium rifle with 40% more bashing damage. Not the best but better than average.
---
This is a fun idea! It's definitely something I want to explore, while also not taking away from dev time. If there are any other suggestions you have for our weekly live streams and content you would like to see featured on them I would love to hear them!
---
My rule of thumb is if they have over 15 pieces of "armor" for sale you can be sure it's all common trash outfits. 2-8 pieces is the sweet spot where you can be confident they're selling legendary items.
---
I still have Fallout Forever glitched, my main character is over lvl 200 now. So I'd be forced to make another character and level it up to 100 for a chance at the achievement popping up that time...
---
Because Bethesda. =/

Yeah the same! I was feeling like spec-ops scouting around the area before rushing to claim it

If you shook your head you moved.

&gt; And adventure mode cannot be considered a survival at all when players are actively looking for dangers. This game mode at the current state is a kill, loot and collect game at best. If players are actively looking for lvl 100 3 star legendaries instead of running away it means the game is too easy.
---
That's kind of the point though. This is a MMO, not a survival game. I'm hoping nuclear winter gives us a proper hardcore survival mode, but there's no point speculating until it comes.
---
Bloodbugs are all running Unarmed Incisor builds.
---
I‚Äôd pay a cap per shell.  Do it.
---
Yes. It would probably be easy and is already in the pipeline with the mailboxes that are coming. You talk a lot but say nothing meaningful.
---
The issue is the first foundation piece is too far in the ground or too far out of the ground (really Bethesda!?!?)
---
I had to move my base.
---
I played with 1 foundation and 1 stair.
---
If foundation was too far either way, the stair could not be stored or scrapped and I had to move cam again to break them apart.
---
When you move, do the same thing. As long as stair will store from the first foundation then you're good.
---
SBQ battles can be a bit fickle, and Disconnects or crashes are a regular occurance, but there are some things you can do to improve your success rate;
---
* Make sure you are an a stable server before dropping a Nuke, if someone else dropped it, consider this before joining.
---
* Proper placement is Important, most of the really High Damage producing players (myself included) don't want to fight in the Rad Zone.
---
* Make sure there are enough High level players on the Server to get the job done quickly, but not so many as to cause too much lag, any more than 8 at the Event will cause lag and more than 12 will most certainly cause some to DC.
---

I do a lot of SBQ battles with a regular group, there are usually 6-9 of us with 2-3 teams, and we routinely kill the SBQ in under 4 minutes, and have done it 3 times in a row on one server many times with nobody getting DC'd.
---
I looked for this for a teammate‚Äôs birthday on PC and was unsuccessful. Is this something that‚Äôs only available for console players?
---
Yes, with the 4th of July coming we need fireworks for our camps.

And some Scorched Bald Eagles flittering about.

TOO OP RITO PLZ NERF!!
---
Yeah its pretty stupid, you have BS like full Sent/Assassin with Serendipity making players basically unkillable, even worse if their solo with Lone Wanderer, and ultra cheap weapons like full auto Tesla Rifles which seem to ignore 100% of your resistances so even if you have like 500 ER the arch damage will still kill you in 3-4 hits, and not only that require no legendary effects or perks to make viable.(only Legendary Tesla worth a damn is a Quad one)
---
Survival always boils down to like 4-5 dudes just repeatedly spawning and killing one another until all but 1 group quits the server finally. Not only that people kill each other regularly so much all it takes to be in the top three is you actually play the game for about 10-15 minutes to get their, and once your in the top three you have to make a choice....
---
Cool, man!
---
Lead and steel as well.
---
I do use radiation to control my health but  bloodied at least with me I sneak around a lot all my guns have silencers. There are perks you can take if you want to run and gun like dodgy. But I find it fun just walking up to Yao Guai standing right next to them and 1 hitting them. Unyielding armor is a must if you are considering a melee build along with radicool.
---
It's the damn metal stairs. Every time I build them they bug out like that.
---
So since you haven't experienced any of them, people are obviously lying about them. Solid reasoning.
---
What about if your stash is full? My stash is full of items being sold at my vending machine. I bulk stuff to save weight, so I can carry more stuff.
---
Agreed! Keep the current 'bulk' options as 'Bulk Junk' and add a new menu in the Tinker's bench called 'Bulk Ammo'. 
---
Maybe it's a little more expensive to discourage over-use, like it takes 5 plastic to make a bulk of something rather than the 2 for junk bulking, but I think it could be balanced decently enough. Maybe even make a small but annoying quest that has to be completed first so there's not just a sudden over-saturation of cheap, easy to stock up on ammo.
---
It‚Äôs not the headset that‚Äôs the problem it‚Äôs the software.
---
I didn't get one, but I did find the plans on vendors that's how I got them. 
---
I will eventually get them pain in the ass badges but not right now.
---
You don't have to go to a "PVP Server" to enter PVP.  There are a few ways to enter PVP.
---
1) Take control of a workshop.  This automatically opens you up for PVP with anyone.
---
2) If you have Pacifist Mode OFF, attacking another player.  This opens you up for PVP with that player and their teammates.
---
3) Being on a team with someone who is open for PVP.
---
4) Entering Survival Mode when you log into the game (as opposed to Adventure Mode) automatically opens you up for PVP.
---
I think that's it...I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm forgetting something.
---
Pvp is the survival mode :3 Good luck in there ^^'
---
I dumped 15 in intelligence, Charisma, and luck, and got a full set of unyielding armor, with herd mentality, magnetic personality and then I have a few random +charisma pieces with The unyielding effect on.
---
My alt toon participated it at level 15, got the usual wood leg piece and a mascot head, died only three to four times so it wasn‚Äôt too bad. I didn‚Äôt have heavy guns at that level so I just ran circles around the sheep non stop and blasted her with a pump shotty. It was a pretty good adrenaline rush. Got many thumbs-ups from the level 100+ players around me üòÉ
---
I had the same issue with some foundation pieces the other day, I had to piss away 40 caps replacing my camp in the same exact spot and waste 3+ hours of building my house to fix it.... They need to remove some of the absolutely stupid restrictions on camp building. I hate how you can't just place floor pieces without foundation or attached to foundation, but you can be a jackass and build a 5 story house off a floating ladder connected to nothing...
---
Which I suppose is fine, I myself would just like other players to be more of bullet sponges so that fights can actually be more interesting
---
Build another set of stairs on the other side of the floor and it should let you scrap the first set of stairs.
---
If you have them in your inventory, you can craft them ONLY at the CHEM STATION IN ARKTOS BUILDING, NOT AT YOUR CAMP.
---
It‚Äôs boring but it‚Äôs much more effective. A small price to pay for salvation.
---
Thanks for the report and the tags, we'll look into this!
---
Use fireman perk maxed out with dense mods on your chest.   I run explosive shotgun build and can shoot things point blank.   Can‚Äôt kill myself at all and that‚Äôs with demo expert maxed out
---
It'd be pretty cool if the community naturally does it; like how WoW Horde Players go to the front of Orgrimmar if they want to PVP or Alliance Players who go to the Goldshire Inn for-- well, for scantily-clad stuff.

Well, then you can explain to me how the issues went from server or game wide to a very small handful of people.
---
... I meant link to sites looking at sales numbers... And like I said, there ARE NONE, the closest we have is out dated guess work with no verification or credible sources. I'm pretty sure that ties in like that wouldn't inflate the numbers too much and like I said, PEOPLE. BUYING. IT. DISCOUNTED. MEANS. HIGHER. PLAYER. COUNT. This isn't an argument about PROFITS, it's you saying the game has a tiny player count. Which you yourself are no invaliding and is a rocky unverified and unproven metric anyway.

So what‚Äôs the point of a 3 star... every time a 3 star drops a 2 or 1 Star is infuriating. Just make them 2 star or 1 Star enemies and end of story. You still get your fulfillment of getting a 3 star from a 3 star and you lose the disappointment of it not dropping.
---
Always happens to me, there have been a few times I'm about to attack and I stop to reload.
---
I've started reloading as soon as I log in.
---
I see this as ground zero for griefers.
---
I think the stinging is the better trade off. I run stealth commando and things die from 1-2 rounds to the head already. Having extra AA wouldn't really effect my qol, but the extra ammo reduces my reloads.
---
I'm not sure but they aren't aligned with yours.
---
Everything you want fixed is intended.
---
you just respawn at the vault and fast travel back. It'll cost some caps but there's nothing else you can do. You won't be over-encumbered unless you're carrying weapons you need scrapping down but there's benches not to far from the Vault. 
---
its an annoying bug but there is always a way around it. Worst case scenario you log completely out and lose your junk.
---
Yeah a guy called BADcompanysarge on YouTube did something similar. I would reccomend checking it out if you get the time.
---
Not sure. I submitted a ticket to support.
---
You explained what survival is like perfectly.
---
Due to how they coded it, Bethesda is having trouble preventing auto-scrapping while still allowing bulk to be used automatically for crafting. They've acknowledged the issue, but report that they "need to introduce new functionality" to fix the issue.
---
Here's a link to that thread:

---
No, most people aren't even playing it, go look on ebay at the amount of "new" copies are being sold on there from people who bought the controllers just for the controllers and have zero intention of playing the game.
---
I mean hell, by your own link "sea of theives" a game with a TINY playerbase that is considered nearly abandoned at this point is like 5 places a head of it. As is Fallout 4, which does have numbers on active players, 3500 players on fallout 4 on average, and it is higher than fo76 on your list. LOL
---
Are you sure it's not just because you have 2 fewer plastic?
---
Only thing since a while back that benefits from bulking for storage is aluminium and lead.
---

---
Yup! I still have issues with my Enclave underarmor when I wear the BoS Bomber Jacket too! It's such a shame too because I love the outfit T\~T
---
Not dead, needs a lot of tuning, like the very requested 'Server Alert'
---
They did it for the Dragonqueen and the Sheep Imposter, why did they decide not to do it for Project Paradise?
---
Thanks
---
Nice. A VE handmade is on my wants list.
---
It's because Bethesda introduced this bug while trying to fix mods from auto-scrapping and haven't fixed it since.
---
I just use BOS Combat Armor on all my characters, I can wear a backpack while still displaying the logo.
---
I can confirm it works.  The only noticeable effect is the gained AP will flash
---
I had no idea as I had never completed it successfuly.  Thanks!
---
Ooh, this is a really good idea. I don't think they'd ever make it so players can mark other players' maps or pop server messages because of the load that would put on it, but I could see this.
---
Heck, make them Pioneer Scout Possum quests; it fits in with survival stuff.
---
I'm on ps4. thanks anyway
---
Nice. Make a flock of bird people to purge the Wasteland and have someone in a Plague Rider outfit be at the head!
---
Ahh cheers mate.
---
Was able to verify this is the problem.  Will submit support tickets.
---
Much appreciated :)
---
Thanks. I‚Äôm on Xbox. :)

Good to know! I‚Äôm a 2 handed melee build so I really shouldn‚Äôt have given an answer. Might make a stealth sniper character tho.
---
Thanks. I‚Äôm playing on Xbox.
---
So better crits does work contrary to the op's test?
---
Xbox.
---
Hi! Thanks for your reports about these issues, the dev team is aware of both and looking into them.
---
Can you please do something about the fact that deaf players are unable to communicate with others in the game due to having no text chat option, same with allowing players to change the pipboy UI color in the INI files like it was done in fallout 4 for those players who are colorblind?
---
It really sucks to see a major game like this just completely ignore disabled players.
---
Are you on PC? I gave away my backup pump TSE to a fellow solo shotgunner a couple of weeks ago,  but I'm a pretty active trader so I'm always coming across stuff. I'll keep an eye out for you.  Friend me. IGN=The_zimmers

Yeah, no.

 &gt; Hi! Thanks for your reports about these issues, the dev team is aware of both and looking into them.

Yep. Xbox. Would love to complete the revive and swim challenge.
---
But once you get end game most people just ignore diseases as is. I mean who doesn't have radworms 24/7?
---
Wow..... I had no idea looks like you have no Atom cards for PC. That's pretty lame they should set these up. It makes no sense you guys don't have these.
---
If there are gift cards for whatever shop you buy them from would this work?
---
I cackled
---
Vault dwellers log. Its bright wait is that mininuk-
---
You can craft the enhancer and other recipes Only at Chem Stations in the Arktos building. Try to craft at the chem stations upstairs inside the building. I made 4 different   Solvents from: Creature deterrent   Creature attractant   Growth enhancer   Growth suppressor
---
If your stash is full of vending items that's a choice you've made, can't have it all unless you have trade-offs.
---
Besides the suppressor, what do you think of the skin? I was considering getting it.
---
All the people that would work on this are busy making skins for the Atom store.
---
Break it down to scrap.
---
Then do whatever you want with it.
---
Definitely should be able to get lead, gunpowder and brass (steel, I guess in game terms) out of all that 10mm ammo sitting around.
---
If they made a room in Whitesprings where you could log out and log back in to, that would become this by default. Maybe the lounge with the bartender upstairs.
---
Nah. Finders keepers in the wasteland.
---
awesome
---
Thanks! Am on xbox though.

Here's a video I did on it. I got the uniform in Thirst Things First, traded some gear and a ton of caps for helmet, and then got the helmet *again* as a drop from Back On The Beat.

I like that spot, it‚Äôs easy to find, and I can do a bit of shopping at the same time.
---
I love a bit of survival, I think once you've got to a certain level, got hold of decent weapons and can take on a few Scorchbeasts with ease the only real challenge is from other players. Personally I don't bother scavving or doing vendor runs during it as if someone takes you out it becomes pretty tedious. 
---
The only thing I'm not a fan of is how spread out everyone is, 24 players in a server makes it hard to track down where people are so you can actually engage in PvP. Otherwise I'm a fan, really looking forward to what they do with Nuclear Winter.
---
I mean the other option is to just drop all the stuff, why would I drop thousands of chems and plans?
---
It happened to me a week ago. I just quit and restarted.
---
Just find something you enjoy playing and role with it. This is the type of question that other people can‚Äôt answer for you. For instance I love smacking things with a hammer but my buddy enjoys sniping. Experiment and find something you like.
---
&gt; Alliance Players who go to the Goldshire Inn for-- well, for scantily-clad stuff.
---
Christ on a cracker, I stumbled in there once during a big session. I felt my last hope for humanity die that day.
---
It shouldn‚Äôt be the junks, you should have dropped them when you died. You‚Äôre overencumbered probably because you picked up lots of aids/weapons/armor pieces. 
---
This happened to me before, especially when I was in Excavator armor. When I login it allows me to carry up to 550 lbs, but if I die it will drop back to 450 lbs. If I didn‚Äôt pay attention and picked up too much stuff, I won‚Äôt be able to fast travel unless I respawn at 76 and drop those weapons and armor pieces.
---
My family used pop-up campers from 3 years before I was born until we stopped going on regular family trips when both my brother and I went off to college.
---
Only thing we hated as we got older is that we were responsible for cranking to pop it up or collapse it, but with a family of 4 the setup was always super quick.
---
We also had a huge yard so we just parked it out there and opened it so it could dry/air out as needed.
---
Half the time my brother and I just stayed out there all summer instead of inside the stuffy house, haha.
---
Shameless self-promotion time! This has been a classic livery of mine for some league racing on FM7 (and before that FM6).

https://i.imgur.com/whxNH2fh.jpg
---
Wait, are you serious? I haven't seen anything relating that before.
---
Thank you! :)
---
If you're on an event then yes... don't take someone else's stuff.
---
Stop dying.
---
Wait, when did they start dropping the aid item? In my experience they only drop the junk one. The aid item can only be obtained at two static world locations.
---
On another subject, what‚Äôs with all of the wendigos in Whitesprings lately!? I saw 3 glowing ones yesterday! I swear they‚Äôre following me around.
---
I can‚Äôt
---
&gt; I stumbled in there once during a big session.
---
That sounds like a load
---
Fuck I haven‚Äôt even gotten one yet. No idea what or how to start
---
This was long before the BETA even came out, it is why the perk packs exist. They were in the very early stages planning on selling them in the atom shop like lootboxes. It didn't get very far but the perk system is still weird due to how it was implemented in the very very early parts of the games development.
---
hey neighbor! I almost took your spot. my camp is actually a minute away. the lower pond between the raider camp and sandy's still. 
---
XB1-GT: Gr8dne42
---
paper bags are God's gift to the wasteland.  I will always drop my junk (if I have anything worth keeping) before entering an event.  The only times I don't is if I don't care to lose my junk...because that's what happens in the wastes.
---
Taking an already existing in-game item and putting into an in-game box essentially (an already in-game action) is the same thing as implimenting a completely feature dealing with real life currency? Now you are being intentionally obtuse. 
---
I talk a lot because in an argument you make a point and then you clarify that point. Don't ever try a debate if you can't understand that.

And what does catering to whales have to do with anything? Of course they want people to spend money. And those whales can. There is nothing stopping them.

Can you still get a possum badge drop for campfire tales? Haven't had one in the last week...
---
yeah it happens to me on PS4 every time, and everytime i tell myself ill unequip bullet weapons and switch to melee when i log out so when i log in i wont lose bullet....but i never remember
---
i agree it sucks to lose ammo everytime
---
It would be fun to resurrect the speakeasy and use that for socializing (wouldn‚Äôt  it be fun if they made some board games playable?)
---
Same, could be a few hours could be 30 minutes. Technically not really ‚Äòdisconnected‚Äô, just old fashioned freeze then blue screen of peace.
---
Why not just farm than you'll need, instead of micro managing specific amounts, or asking for extensive coding changes? It's not like resources are finite, or you won't be using them eventually for repairs, etc..
---
How bout for July 4th they add craftable firework cartridges using firecracker berries for the boom and other plants to change the color?
---
Just make a habit of dropping junk off in your stash
---
They made it so addictions remain after death, so you are not special or experiencing a glitch my friend.
---
Damn I almost woulda believed that was a real truck those graphics look great
---
Looks like Better Criticals works uncorrectly, huh?
---
You can, I still get 1 every 4-5 events.
---
After like a month straight of CoD prop hunt all I saw were props. I work in a warehouse and it‚Äôs all I could think about.
---
What mmo style games do you know where boss fights drop exactly what you want without grinding for it? One shorting legendaries or even server hopping legendaries should not give you a three star every time or they become to common.
---
I love the idea of survival, but the current state of PVP in this game is the worse I've played in a decade. But it would probably be a lot more fun if I bought a duped set of sentinel/vanguard armor. Last time I played I spawn at the whitesprings station and got killed instantly by some need with a TSE shotty who was standing 5 feet away from the spawn point
---
Also, under no circumstances, aside from number of PVP kills, should I be shown on the map. So dumb.
---
If you wish to hold Fallout 76 + Red Dead 2 + GTA V and GT sport Id recommend you modify your PS4 to:  
---
(Some people will say this info was taken from Pleiades Supercomputer. I call it a mere coincidence) 
---
* Manufacturer: SGI.
---
* 160 racks (11,440 nodes)
---
* 7.24 Pflop/s peak cluster.
---
* 5.95 Pflop/s LINPACK 
---
* 175 Tflop/s HPCG
---
* Total CPU cores: 245,536.
---
* Total memory: 935 TB.
---
* 2 racks (64 nodes total) enhanced with NVIDIA graphics processing units
---
In other words, game sizes are getting ridiculous.
---
SBQ and Encryptid don't require a team. I play solo and I've still done both a bunch of times.
---
You don't actually need to be IN a team for either of those. You'll die a lot either way, but you can contribute and the other players present will help complete the event.
---
Even just farming for mats in a nuke zone - as a level 58 it's still hard for me to solo any of the mobs in a nuke zone (especially Whitespring where my FPS turns to crap), but I just follow really high level players around. Help kill everything. You still get loot and exp even not on a team, so long as you damage the mobs.
---
I'm no expert so I have a question for you. Honestly I'd like some insight on this.
---
Why can't they direct request for this info to a server which is either low traffic or set up for this only?
---
I'd have to imagine these request would use fewer resources than actually playing and spawning your camp etc. It would be static info not active the app could populate with your info and be done with the API request. It wouldn't be active or draining resources.
---
They could even limit it to one refresh per X amount of hours and store the info locally on your device.
---
I think what we are all saying is that the description is extremely vague, and factually incorrect. It doesn't increase healing at all, it simply gives health regen outside of combat.
---
I‚Äôm pretty new to the game, how would this help griefers?
---
Can we first have a game that doesn't lag constantly or crashes?
---
Survival is the only way you can feel like you are in a wasteland. The feeling that someone could be watching you is amazing but they should go back to the players with most kills are highlighted . Adventure mode is not a wasteland and is way too easy with no threats at all. The only threat in this game are other players.
---
There is very nice deathclaw gauntlet as a reward on survival in June.
---
even the plastic in the bulk still counts to the overall.
---
I bulk everything that I can, even screws and springs. every little helps.
---
If I can gain even a couple of pounds....................................
---
so many times i've had a clear out, only to find that I now need some of the stuff iv'e dumped, so im always at the 800 mark
---
That would be fantastic. I‚Äôm so jealous that console players can already do this!
---
Nice, thank you.
---
Ahh typical junkie talking why should I believe a thing you say?  I couldn't resist how do you like the junkie weapons I always turn mine into scrip because I heard it was broken.
---
Bandolier was the only thing I could think of when I saw it. Everything else looked good üëç
---
yeah this would be amazing, i feel my friend gets annoyed every few days when i make her stand there as i do my transfers
---
I played Horde, exclusively, for a long long time. I finally decided to try an evil race, and one of the earliest places I wound up was Goldshire. That pretty much ended my Alliance career.
---
I'll test this legendary effect as soon as possible. Want to try armor penetration effect with critical shots - will crit ignore armor or not? Have lot of weapons with crit damage on it
---
 That would be ideal, but I doubt they have an issue making a bloodied build garbage.
---
Seems the only buffs that can be endlessly stacked are the bloodied/adrenal reaction/nerd rage higher damage at lower health ones. Which explains why bloodied builds can get so much more damage than any other class.
---
Never log out with your quad crossbow equipped. That's my rule.
---
Elevation is your friend. There's always a ridiculous amounts of bugs with that event ending, and even at lvl 195, lvl 14 radscorpions can 1-shot me if they pop up behind.
---
Well I just tried and took multiple attempts and finally found it open, but no plans.... ugh lol
---
from what i remember unless it got patched get lead belly then you take minimal rad damage and full cannibal you literally heal faster than the damage.
---
This was a beautiful true story of life in the apocalyptic appalachia.
---
That's different.  Unlocking it on a person's account for all their alts is one thing, but allowing people to sell backpacks to people who haven't earned it is completely different.
---
Yeah buddy bench!
---
Added a link to a video of the issue.
---
I hate explosive weapons. They are extremely overrated.
---
Yeah tbh I just struggle finding weapons that suit my play style and finding enough supplies to craft and or find ammunition! Does my bloody head in
---
I gave up on marine armour and went back to wearing combat armour, but half of the time I don't wear any at all. 
---
I know what you mean though, because doing a silo or something similar where you get battered from all angles by gutsy's is near impossible for me, but I am bloodied so that's probably why lol.
---
Get gud
---
When you track it and shoot the missle at it it flees and it runs super fast. It never stops from there. I just gave up and server hopped. Loading times take so long that i fast travel to a place near the cargobot, but by the time i load in, its halfway across West Virginia.
---
I had considered this, but I haven't used it during either events
---
Per
---
Upvote because yes please. The objects exist already in the game world. Not sure of which city I was in. Maybe bottom left corner of ash heap but when marsupial jumping from roof to roof, I saw multiple planters with crops in them. If those dead losers can have them, why can‚Äôt we?!? Looking at you Bethesda!
---
I want play golf and tennis at Whitesprings. Shoot an albatross, farm ghouls. Win win.
---
I do a lot of my armor lead lined for rad resistance, so not sure. I usually mod them to have as much defences as possible though
---
This could be the case. I will have to check
---
Could the trade forums have been affected by duping and player vending? 
---
I mean Bethesda must still be supporting it for a reason unless they're flogging a dead horse.

If they want to make a chat and have it fit into the game, just put it on the pip boys like your receiving a text message on your phone or in a ‚Äúgroup‚Äù chat. That way  the text doesn‚Äôt really interrupt gameplay and is more immersive.

And pulling open Ebay, Fallout 76 has just about 850 unique listing, most single copies... Which yeah is high, but it's also an extremely small amount of total copies in circulation.

This is a more common issue with software than people realize. More so, It is a training issue for the developers and graphical designers.
---
It's not that companies don't want to help with this issue, it's that many of the people involved in creation don't think about it or even know it's an issue.
---
I have 35 years experience in the software field and there are so few times where I've worked projects where this was even thought of. Only after you have worked a project where ADA 508 compliance was needed do you even think of these as standards in designs for your future products. While I'm not (yet) in need of these myself, I ask all reading this to up vote this topic so that others that do need it can enjoy our favorite game too!

I know it's easy to dismiss this when your 10-30 years old, but it was not until I turned 48 that I started to have issues with my eyes and it is the NORM for all! It will happen to you too! Maybe not color blindness, but vision will start to blur.
---
The problem is you would have people creating multiple accounts to "gift" shop items to their primary. I could create new xbox live accounts for free all day and each one comes with that initial chunk of atoms, and that is before you even consider the free atoms from the daily/weekly challenges.
---
Oh man that's beautiful. I love old sidestep Fords as it is, but you really captured it well.
---
Also creatures can be a threat if death is penalized enough. It‚Äôs not the environment to be easy, it‚Äôs the system.
---
We must be playing different games. I'm on PS4 it runs pretty smoothly maybe one crash in the last month-and-a-half.
---
Worst issue I get is the Magic Carpet and invisible ghouls when I first log on. 5 minutes of playing and they're gone.
---
they could bring the little crop squares from the dlc in fallout 4
---
I hate that. On the up side, if you are that strong, the lighter PA perk means you can carry your main battle PA and the excavator in your pockets.
---
Not sure I will have space for it, but ill check on the dense torso mod :)
---
Not sure on the dense torso mod. Quite possible, ill check tonight
---
There has to be consequences to dieing
---
i did my three tadpole badges yesterday, swimming, archer &amp; athletics. my short-term memory must be fucked up because i had to look up the location names 10 times AND remind myself of the coordinates on google. so pleaaaaase for the love of god, let us have map markers. there are about a million bridges in this game and most of them are miles long, i had to look 10 minutes for the intercom to start the athletics challenge and 20 minutes to find the damn swimsuit and intercom for the swimming challenge. i know we‚Äòre supposed to explore, but there was nothing to explore.
---
Like to add I had plenty of camp budget left(not even halfway full) had turrets and spot lights all over the base to try and protect what ever made its way back to my camp
---
Thats why I said in the beginning that pvp needs to be integrated in the normal servers. Like a wilderness in runescape where you can go if you want pvp with better loots spots, better monsters, better drops etc.
---
2 different modes is dumb and separate the players. put them together and have pvp zones with all the good loot and mines we all look for. A guarantee 3 star drop... Go to the pvp zone. etc. 
---
some real benefits. Or really rare new stuff which can be rewarded in those zones.
---
Also dont make it a kill on sight.. should be a better system than that.
---
Cadazores. So close....
---
And some don‚Äôt get caps as quick so how about no? Just give us a cap and scrip limit increase because the limit is on the stupid low side..
---
Wendigo Vending
---
I agree.  Mutants is really frustrating.  5% per mutation sounds about right dps-wise.  The Slayer perks should all be +60 or 100% damage per type.  Junkies at 10% per addiction sounds about right.
---
Really wonder where they pulled their numbers from
---
Go straight for the wendigo as soon as he appears. Kill him and you complete the event. I had the same scenario by myself and you can mop up after it's complete.
---
Right. People ask for the most random shit like it‚Äôs not a gigantic pile of work to add very small features
---
Even 1 rank makes a huge difference. I run 2-3‚òÜ's for that, and the fact that it makes you completely impervious to scorch beast attacks.
---
I'd love to try it out but Im not touching PVP in this game with a 10ft pole. If it respected pacifist mode, I'd be all over it.
---
I normally do get up on the roof but doing the event solo forces you to attend to the campfire every 10 seconds or so.
---
Head to any train station and interact with the "Pioneer Scout" poster to kick things off. Happy scouting!
---
"At times" puts it mildly.  I've had a number of otherwise great locations marred by the difficulty of planting crops.  Razorwheat, melons, and gourds are the worst offenders, but other things can get tricky as well.  Not a lot of buildable and gardenable flat land in Appalachia, apparently.
---
Yeah same thing. Never got the ‚Äúreward‚Äù on the reward screen but had randomly checked after a friend of mine got it and it was there. It was a pleasant surprise.
---
Hoarder.
---
It's better if you buy atoms for a friend, because that way nobody can loot the atoms on a hacked account.
---
I will take any bag i find , if you dont want to lose junk dont carry junk . Once you die and drop your junk it is fair game
---
When you previously mentioned it to the dev team, what did they say?
---
"We'll consider it?" "Maybe?" "Yes?" "Probably not?"
---
Yeah sometimes. I‚Äôve done the event like 45 times already, no backpack. 4 lab coats and 2 formula p recipes though. 
---
What‚Äôs bugging me rn is the elevator is saying ‚Äúinaccessible‚Äù
---
Dense mod is torso only, very rare hard to find- I've never seen a plan myself in 150 levels. It basically makes you explosion proof. Fab if you hit a car or a legendary robot and don't jump out of the way in time. I paid a dude 15 stable flux and 250 caps to mod my armor for me. Damage resistance didn't change but my TSE hasn't hurt me since.
---
On PC, for the Xbox360 controller(for the PC) its the button left of the big round "X".
---
Same button as the 3rd person/1st person view change key.
---
lol, yeah. fuck right outta here, implying that we‚Äòre all stupid. i played Fallout 1 and 2 without google, and all you get are pip-boy objectives and the things that NPCs tell you. but guess what, all of that was actually pretty well written and fun to do. i spent hours talking to EVERYONE and exploring EVERYTHING because it was actually rewarding. but sure, we just want everything dumbed down because we don‚Äòt know any better. :)
---
I love how your armor and protections stacked in 4. A nice set of Trappers or metal armor under there meant nothing could touch you. I had a fully upgraded Shroud costume, which was amazing on its own. Godlike in power armor.
---
I understand why they did it, game balance and all that. But I do miss it.
---
Yea I noticed I wasn't taking much damage from a scorchbeast. I will have to check this mod tonight incase it was on the chest piece
---
Why are you asking the first or second question? No ones asking for that, no one wants the rng to change. Simply put, a 3 star enemy should drop a 3 star loot. Reduce the number of 3 star Enemies so that the number of 3 star legendaries being looted doesn‚Äôt change?
---
I usually do it solo. I sit on the bears head and wait for the fire to get to &lt;40%, you can jump from there to the fireside, then back.
---
The deathclaw gauntlet is nice. All survival weapons are. The action hero is awesome for example. And the quick fix is favourite junkie weapon at the moment. And even the not so useful ones sell for a high price to collectors.
---
Enemies seem to have a hidden inventory, which you can glimpse briefly when inspecting before it switches the loot to your instanced loot.
---
Theres a lot of side games they could add, they already have pool, arcade machines, and Id also love to see slots as well
---
Yeah, kind of the point of the game.
---
Do you die from a nuke blast if you are inside the Whitesprings when the missile lands?
---
All jokes aside, 70-80GB.
---
Exactly. I went and got Plague Bearer because who ever cures disease anyway? Might as well be doing extra damage as a melee build.
---
Maybe so, I just like em :)
---
I saw that last night too. It didn‚Äôt clear up after the area loaded in completely or when I fast traveled far away then returned. But when I server hopped, it worked just fine in the new server. Sorry about the crappy RNG, hopefully you‚Äôll get it. Remember to keep checking under modify at the armor bench
---
So lower the chance for 3 stars spawning... easy fix.
---
Pioneer Scouts. Head for the Pioneer Scout Camp in the Toxic Valley. Once you complete being a Tadpole Scout you unlock the backpack and become a Possum Scout. Possum Merit Badges can be spent buying backpack upgrades.
---
Or just equip a hazmat suit to your fave wheel and equip it when you notice it‚Äôs a blast zone while loggin in. You may take some rads while the game loads but you won‚Äôt die as long as you switch quick enough.
---
Just making sure but you aren't bulking anything but aluminum or lead to save weight right?
---
ROFL, you think the fact 11k active players being higher than fallout 76 is a good sign? That means there are less than 11k players playing this game by your own link.
---
After they nerfed the explosives again, in patch 9 I believe it was, the splash damage is almost non existent anymore. I got stuck in one of my walls and used my double barrel to kill myself to re spawn and now I get nothing.
---
I bought my first Instigating lever action last night  -same price. Pity you wern't giving it a test run when the big boy showed up....
---
Who sits?
---
Yeah this is a big issue with long loading weapons like the gatlings, and it doesn't help that the pneumatic armor mod seems like the only method of reducing stagger
---
Nope. Gotta be some sort of penalty for dying.
---
There should be an associated quest. Something like "rebuild the community greenhouse in Flatwoods" or something. 
---
You would get greenhouse building plans, which include planters. Maybe unlock growable versions of plants. 
---
Bethesda, give us mooorrreee!!!!
---
Not really. Having 5k stimpacks is nowhere in the challenges or missions. Learn to let go brother or sell them in bulk for cheap and buy some good weapons
---
Find Berkley Springs, there is a lot of good plans there that can be cheap.
---
Yea I am leaning towards this now. Especially if it gave high defence at the time I was modding the armor which was the main draw. 
---
I have been blowing up cars in whitesprings  a lot with it so far and getting knocked about and haven't really noticed damage, so its looking likely
---
actually, you cant max out sniper build to its full capacity,there isn't enough space in perception.
---
9 rifles 3 tank 3 long shot and 3 steady hand. one can get by with 1 steady hand and I can swap out,long shot with glow,etc, all depending on situation/time.
---
soldier on.
---
Something.  A true Communist threat beyond annoying little blenders.
---
Put a halfwall between each row of roofing. You can make a "sort of" pyramid this way. Just keep in mind, they can be wonky, and you'll have to add 2 half walls, then remove the lower one to have a wall not connected to the floor.
---
I had a 4 tiered roof for a long time before I had to start scaling back for budget.
---
Because the servers are Amazon cloud servers, and the way they handle inventories. Every single items even stacks of items are treated as single items. So basically every time a inventory would be called it would end up causing as much lag as player logging into the server. With how poorly the servers handle large inventories having a few hundred "inventory calls" for unique players will cause massive lag even more so than the servers already have.
---
What you are asking why they can't make a server specifically for it, even if they did, that server would still be required to pull the info from the actual play servers, thus lagging them.
---
Two different modes is necessary.   PVP and PVE have very different needs.   Most of the nerfs you see in PVE are due to PVP whining.
---
No you don‚Äôt die if you are inside a location and a nuke hits outside the location
---
It's what happens to every low level player my group invites.. About 20% of the time they become part of the group and do the same thing in the future..
---
Love me some whitewall tired
---
They will if your shop is set up next to a major battle point like Arktos or the Queen. When you run out, you don't want to have to leave the whole mess long enough to make more.
---
Cool I never knew. Thx.
---
I have already done everything so u are little bit late buddy
---
What difference would that make? Besides, people will then complain about too few 3* legendary spawns
---
Go to west Tek and clear, leave building and head south toward hunterville... short fight near a winding trail has a spawn fighting each other, then clear huntersville, then move towards the big nuke holes by monorail elevator. Fast travel to generals steak house clear.  walk north to harpers ferry along road and clear. Fast travel to palace of winding path and proc event. This route provides the most orcs in the fastest way while also leveraging many ‚Äúrandom spawn events‚Äù call it ‚Äúrattles run‚Äù
---
... Ignoring the fact you made up a bunch of numbers and facts to act like my actually posting them is a gotcha, sure...
---
Possibly because you are intending to sell it to a vendor once you get to the nearest train station?
---
This exact scenario happens to me all the time. Need to trim down my stash, so I bulk up all the junk of which I have too much. Start walking to the train station, get in  a fight. Loot corpses, see nearby workbench and scrap all. Bang head against wall, go back to CAMP to bulk excess junk. Walk to train station...
---
I've lost a lot of plastic this way.
---
This is not a debate and I'm not interested in your "intellectual" self flagellation. You don't even know what you're talking about.
---
I just lost interest in the (down)upgrade. Is there ANY benefit to the Possum badges then? All I wanted was the carry weight upgrade.
---
TL;DR My op duped sniper laser shotgun that kills you from behind corner and ignores all armour and perk effects unlike all other weapon has nothing to do with my immense skill.
---
 Someone rub this duper's wang please.
---
Jokes not allowed I guess
---
I will need to try this. Bethesda, if you're listening, it'd do me a major proud if you could allow stackable roofs
---
Balance. There are very few straight upgrades in this game. Almost every weapon mod that increases combat performance reduces weapon durability. 
---
Also you can have multiple backpacks. Logically it makes zero sense, but eh. Neither does me carrying 50 different guns with perks or legendary weight reduction.
---
So, you can have an armored/lead lined backpack for combat, and a refrigerated/extra capacity fir exploration. If you so choose. It‚Äôs all about more choices.
---
If I had to have one or the other, I'd rather have bulk scrap automatically get used. 
---
But damn have I been burned by this several times.
---
Post patch 9 the effects stay after death.  My withdrawals don‚Äôt magically disappear either.  I do see that if you are having withdrawals and pop a chem, it won‚Äôt appear as a withdrawal anymore but will instead show the positive effects.  For that reason I run with 6 withdrawals even though only 5 withdrawals will max out the junkies perk.   That way, when I pop my psycho I only have active withdrawals as my positive effects from psycho are active.  Once psycho isn‚Äôt active I have 6 withdrawals with only 5 affecting my junkie weapon.
---
All train stations have stash boxes.  Bulk it at camp, put in in your stash, go to train station, remove bulked items from stash...problem solved.
---
My manta-man outfit hides the backpack completely. Must be the cape.
---
That is why I carry mine from the stash box at the enclave bunker to the vendor a few feet away.
---
Good luck, we've been asking for an inside corner since BETA.
---
Why would you farm the forest area for legendaries? Watogas not gonna have any legendaries? Besides nar train yard and medical center... (events you mentioned are great. Except free range... that‚Äôs a one star EVERYTIME for me.)
---
Never said I had 5k stimpacks. I only have around 150, 50 for sale and 100 for personal use, I mainly sell mentats and their derivatives such as grape mentats. Also overdrive, lots of overdrive, sells like hotcakes.
---
I have the best weapons already in the game for my build, I am a trader with 5 characters pretty much maxed out on caps to where I have like 10 neon letter signs to make space for caps.
---
I am a trader, so I absolutely need those items as that is literally the point of my character.
---
Why should I have to continue to deal with a bug on bethesdas end? Remember they set bulked items to not be on the "scrap all" list, but a bug reverted it back during patch 5 the same time the bobby pin weight got reverted, only the scrap all never got fixed.
---
good bot
---
(Minuscule) x (the amount of lead I have) = a lot of weight saved.
---
I can help you out if you still need it.
---
Steel also, as it saves weight as well.
---
What happens at the Lighthouse stays at the Lighthouse.
---
How many mats do you lose when you accidentally scrap the bulk?
---
You're missing the point. There are a lot of people who have more than 1 account. Let's just call it "mule" account. Not mention that Fallout 76 is getting cheaper and cheaper. If you have 5 accounts and do the daily challenges. That's 50-60 atoms per day per account. Now you want Bethesda to make a new feature to use your atoms to purchase stuffs on atom store and gift it to your friends? That's Bethesda loss.
---
People can accumulate "free" atoms from daily/weekly challenges on mule accounts and then send the cosmetic stuffs to the main account.
---
An atom gift card will be a nice addition to the store though.
---
If I wanted to give a gift to someone I just cash app them $10 and let them buy the atoms.
---
I find it so funny that this type of post happens so frequently.  A smart person learns from his mistakes.  A  wise person learns from others mistakes.  A dumb person just doesn‚Äôt learn.   If you haven‚Äôt gotten the point of stashing your junk as often as possible then you just might deserve to lose your junk.
---
You realize the number fluctuates on "active players" on steam. Last I checked it was roughly 3500 active players when I checked it last night.
---
You can't bulk screws
---
Huh? Not sure what point you‚Äôre trying to make. I think I‚Äôve seen that message maybe twice in the past month. Have you played recently?
---
Not useless at all.  Probably could sell it and do well.
---
Not sure what you mean by the rug glitch but I built an indoor greenhouse fairly easily:
---
1) Build foundation around a plot of land you want to farm, leaving the ground open.
---
2) Place walls around the "interior" loop of that foundation gap.  Note that the exterior of the wall will face in.
---
3) Roofs will not click in above the crops due to the orientation of the walls, so you need to build a stairway up and build floors over the opening to prevent Marsupial players from jumping right in.
---
4) Place a lock on your greenhouse door and now the only way in is to pick the lock or destroy camp structures, allowing your turrets to defend your crop!
---
I did this for my whiskey and cranberry relish farm.
---
As much as people hate to hear it, it's not.  If the point of the game was hoarding, we would have unlimited stash and unlimited carry weight.  Like it or not, inventory and resource management is a *major* part of 76.
---
You asked "why would I drop thousands of chems and plans?" to which I counter... why would you *need* thousands of chems and plans?
---
Well all you have to do is trade the item in question like they give you a set of powerarmor and you put the paint on it and you drop it sure it's a trust system but it does work
---
When you scrap bulk items, you don't get the plastic back. So the weight difference you are seeing on a lot of the items is just because you are losing plastic. 
---
Only a select few types of junk have a lighter weight when bulked. The rest of it only looks lighter, you would have gained the same space by just throwing your plastic on the ground.
---
Im sure a few people arent on the trading forums because of duping and player vending but not a significant number. Streams are also down and people watch are down. Duping and player vending have nothing to do with that. That is because it doesnt have the fan base it once did. Honestly idk why this is even a discussion. There is nothing to lead anyone to believe that the numbers are the same let alone up
---
What kind of play style are you interested in?
---
Is that Wroclaw?
---
"orcs" lol
---
Does this mean we can have a chance to get the shielded casual underarmor lining plans?
---
Ok so limit players to one inventory check per day. Store/write the info on thier device (I'm talking read only no management) then they can access thier players inventory without causing lag. 
---
It'd work just like the game now to get the players info. Log on a server which has room for a player get your info onto your device 5-10 minutes on a server once per day. Then the info is stored on your device until the next time you update the app. Literally almost no extra resources being used.
---
Because I am a trader and bethesda has come out and stated that the "scrap all" shouldn't be scrapping bulked items, as they fixed it before but patch 5 that reverted a bunch of things reverted it as well.
---
So why should I have to alter my game play to deal with a bug that was already fixed once?
---
No worries at all, reposting existing issues is always better than missing an issue!
---
All I know is that the science scribes outfit is the only thing besides to hide the pack.
---
What did they do in 4? I never kept one around, was too busy wooing a sexy French robot.
---
They'd know where to spawn to annihilate lower level players
---
Well, just to jump into the convo here, what is your play style?  Do you like to run and gun?  Snipe?  Punch shit with a ballistic fist?  Maybe you're into that farming lifestyle or just like building up your camp?
---
I guess other guy was right when he said the disc doesn't install any part of the base game at all? I was kind of hoping that the disc installed the brunt of the assets and the update stuff would be the remaining 30gb of it
---
Especially wendigos. Those things freak me out.
---
What is the carry addition for the refrigerated backpack?
---
That‚Äôs still part of the point though. How the hell are you getting stung with inch thick steel armor? Aside from gas/liquid drenching attacks, nothing should be getting through. And hell, it‚Äôs clear from the models that they have integrated breathing apperatus. Poison shouldn‚Äôt do shit. Acid, sure.
---
LOL at the edit :). I didn't vote you one way or the other, can I come to your pop up camper?
---
You are correct, the good stuff is only available from two locations.
---
Do the daily challenges?  Have you looked at them recently?  Take a picture of a player in a spacesuit while fighting an alien?  It's clear Bethesda are intentionally making them damn near impossible so they cut down on the amount of 'free' Atoms earned.
---
They would have to remake the entire server software over to add that in... They won't even fix long standing bugs, or add things that the entire playerbase wants like text chat, interior walls, inside roof corners, etc.
---
So why would they completely remake the server software just for something that will end up being another avenue of attack for hackers?
---
I do pure sniper..
---
S at 4; P 15; E 1; C 1; A 15; L 15
---
Once I got armor that reduce food drink stim junk etc by 20 percent, the build became really enjoyable. still need a better weapon, but I one or two shot most mobs regularly.
---
It's not being given away free if it's bought by one person and given to another.  Just require the gifting purchase to come from Atoms paid for with money.
---
600+ hours of playing heavy weapons and testing different perks / combinations / different heavy weapons. Melts SBQ in under 3 minutes.

---
Cause right now you see a 3 star, get a 1 Star, then negative feelings. It doesn‚Äôt need to exist. Seeing a 3 star should be exciting at the chance of a USABLE 3 star. What‚Äôs the math right now? 1/400k potential rolls? Getting a 1 Star from a 3 star generates a feeling of getting ‚Äúrobbed‚Äù and tbh makes people not want to play. Had 3, 3 stars last night that my buddy got 3 1 stars and said fuck it and logged out of frustration.
---
You fight a 3 star for the chance of a 3 star weapon.. Not the guarantee.. You still get extra XP for 3 star legendaries. I don‚Äôt see why anyone thinks that all three stars should drop a three star. Then say to take away three stars or make less three star enemies when they still give extra XP and normally a 2 star legendary that you can now scrap for scrip to get a 3 star.
---
See? When you make a point like I don't know what I am talking about, than you have to make at least one point about why that is or else it comes across as hollow and defensive. 
---
I'm not trying to be intellectual at all. But there are ways that you have a conversation with someone to get your point over to the other person or otherwise what is the point? You keep engaging with me for some reason. Is it not to have a conversation? Or are you a need the last word kind of guy? I can let you have it if you need it that bad. 
---
If I'm coming across as "too smart" for you than I'm not sure what to tell you. I mean, I see the obvious implication of that but I'm not that mean to point it out directly.
---
Not much for reading comprehension are you?
---
Everyone wants to be different but instead of multiple "paint jobs" how about a skin that changes the look? so instead of a handmade you get a skin that makes it look like an M4 or any number of different weapons an SMG that looks like a vector with obviously different colour options the weapons still have the same physics but they look different this would also cut back on the reqests for new weapons rather just new skins. thats my pennies worth anyway.
---
Oh you mean like to hide it. I thought you meant like rawhide backpacks. Which I would support.
---
It's from as far back as Fallout 3. Destroyed vertibirds would occasionally center-on-cell teleport to you in the overworld, with all the debris spawning in the sky and crashing down on you. The CoC glitch is a Gamebryo/Creation Engine stable.
---
The 5k stimpacks was just an example. 
---
I guess I understand your position but why not do more detailed and focused traders to cut your weight more ? Like full weight reduction armor and perks and such ?

As much as we all hate it, that demonic anti-christ, vaccinating, pro-abortion, nazi-lovin‚Äô, Atom Shop, it pays for the fucking game!
---
Welcome to the wasteland!
---
Just the plastic you use if you bulk it again
---
It didn't stack in 4 either.

"Circle between the following locations: Arktos pharma, location 2, location 3 etc." Is how that sentence is supposed to be read. Didn't mean "circle the area around Arktos" hehe
---
I never said farm Watoga, I said Watoga Civic Center. Inside. Go there and find out for yourself, a 3* legendary scorched spawns there 30-40% of the time.
---
Too bad for you about the sheepsquatch, but I've seen plenty of 3* spawn during free range.
---
You can add your login credentials to your ini file and launch directly from a desktop shortcut to avoid that. Probably not recommended if your Bethesda account shares a username/password with any of your other accounts.
---
Because those don't matter on stash weight, that only works for stuff you carry, which would be completely pointless as the vast majority of my weight is in my stash which doesn't benefit from utility perks such as thru hiker, bandolier, pharmacist, etc.

Use this to plan your build and see which cards to pick at each level up.

I swear I link this 2 or 3 times a day lol. This is for bloodied, but it still applies if you want to do good damage. There's really no way to do good damage in PvE without going low hp bloodied / adrenal reaction. For what it's worth, a 1 star bloodied .50 cal does 2x the dps of a TSE .50 cal. I've used both with the same build.

And your point? Notice how you only went with 2 days? Try going back more than a week or two. As I don't check the exact numbers every day, because they don't matter to me. Just pointing out the fact that fallout 4 is beating fallout 76 on that list doesn't look good for fallout 76 especially when they are literally giving the game away just to get rid of it. LOL
---
It's likely more of a prioritization problem. "How difficult/time consuming is this" versus "how many more players would it bring in/keep playing."
---
Hey scrapping your bulk is great!! Especially with with lead and steel! Use super duper! Scrap your bulk use super duper get more bulk srap again rinse and and repeat to get more!
---
A few weeks ago I found some duct tape laying by a puddle... I couldn't help mentally but scramble for the adhesive.
---
And you also open the system up to paying real money, in game, for gear. "I'll give you 1,000 atoms for that weapon."
---
I'm actually new to reddit, so i've never seen your posts. Mines a 3* tse .50. Just got it and i'm really excited about it. Thanks for the link, tho.

Others do if you have Pack Rat enabled but thats only if the Bulk is on your person. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqP4Z1L-p8pZ8LNBJ52Am_N11Rn7t6-DK3vs3J6yrck/edit#gid=735562553

30. Baseline is 60, extra is 120, all the others are 30
---
What kind of colorblind are you? I have severe red-green colorblindness and this game doesn't really give me any issues. The options are nice though, going from Battlefield 1 to V was tough because of the lack of multiple colorblind modes. It's something that few games have but should be pretty easy to implement and is a huge improvement for a lot of people.
---
Up near Abbies bunker once I did actually have an encounter with something that's name was Flatwoods Monster.
---
It was a Zetan model with no shell of the monster. 
---
It hit like the monster even though the zetan itself didn't move so it probabaly didn't load properly.
---
I even took a photo for posterity for my loading screens of it dead :)
---
You treating a 3* like a 1* with a CHANCE of dropping 2* or 3* weapons would solve all of this. Demanding BGS to waste their time to change this mechanic just because you refuse to change your mentality is BS.
---
Bet those 3 stars were all from week one?
---
Auto Tesla Rifle dominates this event. Just arc into the ground and it bounces the arc around and smokes everything, radscorpions included. Everything spawns at such a low level even the mobs of flying stuff don't stand a chance.
---
Uh. That was supposed to be ‚Äú30‚Äù, not ‚Äú1.‚Äù
---
Add it up and keep track. Math isn't that hard, people have been using it for thousands of years.
---
Death Mechanics: Cap losses on death in the Survival Beta are now based on the player‚Äôs current level will not exceed 50 Caps. 
---
They haven't changed the adventure mod caps dropped on death thats why is still 50. But you wont find people to pvp unless contesting a workshop and even then people just let it go and switch servers.
---
You waste the Plastic you used to bulk it.
---
Don't get me wrong, TSE is OK, it just got nerfed so damn hard.
---
 I also can‚Äôt think of a single reason to break it back down again other than to use one component out of the entire bulk stack. The frustration is endless
---
It‚Äôs a combo of 15 str plus 20% weight reduction on ammo, weapons, and junk from my armor.
---
Yeah, but you can only have 4 vending machines with 30 items per machine for a maximum of 120 items being sold at a time.  While waiting for these 120 items to sell, I assume you are also out in the wastelands collecting even more chems and plans.  Your supply and demand chain here is lopsided since you are accruing goods faster than you can move them.
---
Then some people will exploit it by creating unlimited multi-accounts for gifting atom shop items to themselves (even run business, just like selling dupe items for real money), as there's a large amount of easy free atoms for new accounts from the challenges.
---
It‚Äôs so much better than adventure mode.
---
There is no wendigo when you get three waves of bugs.
---
And it's a she wendigo...
---
No doubt that Bethesda could solve this exploit by making the Atoms gained for free from the challenges unable to be used in gifting.
---
If today is week one, then sure
---
I concer. Had a tse shotty build, and that got hit hard. Was doing almost 1000 damage per shot...
---
I don't care what they are in, but as long as its some form of buildable spot ill take anything. Planting a farm on terrain that isn't 100% flat is a massive chore in itself :/
---
Do you happen to recall those locations offhand?  Need me some jelly for my cooking badge!
---
Only 120 unique items. You can sell as many in a single stack as you can hold. Not to mention the amount I sell is more than enough to keep up. I actually struggle to keep up with the amount of stuff I sell. It is why I quit selling serums for 100 caps as I couldn't keep up with the demand.
---
I found one at a static location (thanks to [Mappalachia](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia_my_project_which_can_automatically/)) and it wasn't the Aid one it was the Junk one. Was trying to finish my Cooking Merit Badge and i haven't even seen Royal Jelly yet.
---
&gt;  last night.
---
&gt;As I don't check the exact numbers every day, because they don't matter to me
---
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/335501253394038794/583310169149276166/unknown.png
---
Should I do a month now?
---
Um what? Engrish hard. A 1 Star drops a 1 Star, a 2 star drops a 2 star, and a 3 star drops only 3 star. With spawns adjusted so that the looted number of items and their stars DOES NOT CHANGE would literally remove the negative feeling with 0 negative implications to the game or economy.
---
Yeah this would do the trick!
---
You, sir, are most loathsome. üò°üò°üòÄ
---
Damn thanks for the tip dude!
---
Alright cool thanks for the response. I'll have to check if I'm in survival mode or adventure, and if I'm in pacifist mode or not. I'm at work right now. Pvp sounds cool. Building a base with crazy defense seeing how it holds up to other players. Something I always wanted in fo4.
---
Would completely turn me off if they nerfed marsupial because it isn't balanced in their half ass, jerry rigged abyssal excuse of a PVP mode. That's one mistake i've been drive people away over and over in games. Nerfing things because they don't work well in PvP which makes them less useful or fun in PvE.
---
Considering how little stuff comes out for Atom shop that is a pretty bad example.
---
At this point, it's quite aware they are trolling us. I used to get at least 4 dailies done a day, now I'm lucky if I get 2. They are a petty company, and have no idea what they are doing when it comes to small item sales. They make an armor set and sell it for 14 dollars and purposefully handcuff our ability to earn 50 cents a day. It's shady. Not to mention, once you finish most challenges, you absolutely have to spend real world money. I thought they were getting better, and figuring out how to properly structure their item pricing, then yesterday they went and put out another 9 dollar outfit.
---
 Four leaf clover add 10% chance up your meter with 1\*, 11,5% with 2\* and 13% with 38. Are you sure you want use it??
---
I'm really wanting the backpack but constantly hear complaints about it, can you briefly explain what the big deal is?
---
Maybe even a ‚ÄòLooking For Group‚Äô emote or tag?  Perhaps even one that can be see on the world map?
---
Do whichever you like, my point has been made, that a years old single player game with roughly 10k players is above a 7 month old online multiplayer game is very telling. LOL
---
You seem to think I care if I'm a bit off. 3500 or 7k aren't very far off each other when even in your pictures it fluctuates more than that in a day.
---
I've already proven my point and even gotten you to supply the proof for my that this game has under 10k active players. LOL
---
I know it‚Äôs debatable that charisma changes anything but i added the point and got decent crap for once, that‚Äôs the observation take it or leave it.
---
Fired up 4 to test. For some reason my savegame was in a set of Marine Armor, so I used that.  
---
In armor: 132/131/75  
---
In PA, naked: 1200/1000/1070  
---
In PA+armor: 1200/1000/1070  
---
Guess I was wrong. I was sure it stacked, I seemed far more invulnerable in armor than not in PA.
---
Behind the left cabin at "Middle Mountain Cabins".  It can be found next to a grave in a box.  The second is on top of Tanagra Town in a bath tub.
---
Again with this?
---
Please, with your genius level reading comprehension skills, point out where in the original (without the edit at the bottom which was done after my comment) post does it say anything about gifting atoms so that the friend can buy the outfit on his account? The other guy couldn't. 
---
It says that he would like to gift the outfit bundle. Without any mention of payment this implies that   he wants to give a copy of his already purchased outfit to his friend. 
---
Oh- and then the original author clarifies his statement and I relented the point that I was wrong on his wording. But you would have known that if you had used your superior skills to read down farther.
---
Which is why you contest it and then fast travel to where they are at on the map and kill them away from the workshop.
---
It's what you get for keeping the company of meat people. Do you want wendigos? Because that is how we get wendigos.
---
Monochromatic meaning everything is black and white. That's why id prefer to change the colour of the interface to white so the black doesn't eat up the green. I do have really good chroma glasses which allow me to see colours properly but I don't wanna wear glasses forever you know.
---
u/JustJohn99 you're my hero.
---
The problem with this is that the reason I am bulking it isn't really to sell it, but to make room in my stash. Otherwise it'd be smart to bulk it, throw it in the stash, and the next time I'm at a train station just pull it out of the stash and sell it.
---
I‚Äôm the wonkiestdonkey, and it‚Äôs ma‚Äôam. ;P
---
Would be faster by just having the option to 'gift' the desired item to your friend in the atom shop.
---
A free to play game called the Guns up on ps4 had a gifting system like this, it was maybe little bit different.
---
Welcome to Whitespring.  Or West Tek.  Or Robco Corp.  In other words, farming and exploring and if you want to max out Perk cards, do dailies, events, etc and get that XP moving.  
---
Now that the main story is finished for you, there's plenty to do and see.  Have fun with it and don't make it like it's a chore.  More often than not I will go to an event and just explore the area after its finished, and keep moving and exploring.  There's still plenty of stuff for me to do, at level 146 and just shy of joining the 500 hour club.
---
Have fun and safe Wanderings!
---
Cool video! I love these camp showcases and it‚Äôs good to see someone finally doing them on PS4. Ive got a camp you‚Äôre going to love, I get compliments on it daily. I‚Äôll be on later tonight if you want to check it out! Same psn as my username here
---
Mastrubatory nonsense. Stop inboxing me. I don't care.
---
That would only happen in survival.
---
The problem with this is that the reason I am bulking it isn't really to sell it, but to make room in my stash.
---
I dunno‚Ä¶ only ever seen them shoot them. Never fix them, or reload them... and they do tend to just attached spiky bits and barbed wire to them and use them as clubs.
---
never seen one use, say... a cryolator, or plasma gun, though.
---
This would be amazing! I really just want to put foundations and then put planters on it so I can put corn somewhere that it doesn‚Äôt float. So frustrating going back to your farm and half of it is 6 inches off the ground.
---
Ma‚Äôam. :)
---
I think I've gotten them as rewards for doing enclave events like bots on parade
---
Meh. One exception does not justify a gameworld filled with "Hancock": player characters.
---
Ps4 üôÅ
---
I don't get why they'd have to remake the server. You could make a data scraper that gathers the info. It would only take as long as it does to load your characters inventory.
---
There's plenty of mods that assist in inventory management on PC. This would be akin to that. 
---
Again read only gather the info and get off the server it doesn't have to be actively on the servers.
---
Yeah, all these are so valid. I cant stand building a house that can only be placed once.....for no apparent reason.
---
There are a few around military bases, and AntiAir missles, around Watoga.
---
get the white knight perk.  I have over 140 fiber hoarded and I don't even farm for it anymore because of this perk
---
Camp Mclintok, fort defiance, and the BoS stations in the bog.
---
I don't know why there are people still saying sloths and deathclaws can't be tamed. I had to tame a new sloth yesterday when mine disappeared for the 10th time. I don't use WW, only Animal Friend.
---
I do a lot of scouting and stealth in survival and at times actually try to avoid engaging other players.  Sometimes it‚Äôs to trial out different perk builds or learn tendencies or locations but most of the time I do not draw attention to myself.  
---
Getting highlighted on the map though is the worst and is such a dumb design.  I don‚Äôt mind the leaderboard but get rid of the 1-3 circle on the map.
---
It was a joke anyway.  Sheesh, people and their downvotes.
---
So if OP is getting twelve caps per kill it's because he's chasing around little level 12s? In bird culture, this is considered a dick move.
---
Because the servers themselves aren't designed to communicate with anything but the client. To add in the ability for another server to scrap info from the servers would require a whole rewrite to allow them to be scraped.
---
Can't do that anymore. They need to be in the settlement area to be flagged. Unless I read the notes wrong a couple patches ago.
---
And thunder mountain too, in those little tents
---
I think a server wide chat would be a nice addition if nothing else. Like being able to say hey any wana do  the queen or wanting to trigger project paradise. Or like let‚Äôs team up so I can keep respawning the ghouls at white springs. Something around this allowing players to communicate other then fast traveling to camps. Half the people I see in game are usually in a Xbox party and can‚Äôt even hear me talking in the first place. I my self am usually in a party so i don‚Äôt see people talking either. But like last night I wasn‚Äôt and just used my in game chat and no one ever responded to me talking. Not sure if they had mics or not tho.
---
Slightly east of the Becker farm marker just NW of Grafton station is an open house you can build in. There's two more where cow is on the map. You probably know about them, but the house east of Becker was the only pre built house you could attach a lockable door to. Since the last patch you can't do this anymore, which is a shame!
---
Which exactly why they added this. Just so griefers like you can't ruin people's experience.
---
Workshop PVP: The following Adjustments have been made to the rules of Workshop PVP:
---
    Workshop owners must now enter the bounds of the Workshop before they are placed in PVP with the contesting players.
---
    Workshop Turrets no longer attack a Wanted player unless that player is contesting the owner‚Äôs Workshop.
---
    Players that are not actively contesting an owned Workshop cannot damage the objects built there.
---
Depends if you fight back or accidentally hit one of the aggressors
---
Good idea. I do, though, have a vague memory of them being sold at the enclave bunker, where one buys scout armor. I could be delusional.
---
You think that‚Äôs bad.   I had to take some rad-x to drop mutations so I could get 5 str for my athlete badge.  Had to call a drug helpline so someone could be with me for those few minutes I lost marsupial...  those were dark times.
---
You NEVER put rare items in pvp zones ever. It‚Äôs a horrific idea in a game that has more pve players.
---
They don't take up budget anymore.
---
So here is the real way to farm the jelly...  Fair warning it will requires two people.  Player one jumps into a game and goes to Middle mountain cabins and find the jelly.  Player two logs into the same game and waits.  Once player two sees the jelly, player one leaves to find another game.  Player two gets the jelly then follows player one into the next game.  This continues until you have all of the jelly you need.

That last big round of the duped explosive shotties the gf and I ate dinner on the roofs of the whitespring that Friday night and just watched people kill themselves over and over.  We bet on who would or wouldn't and gave bonus points for particularly dramatic deaths.  Winner got the last piece of pizza.  I did not win lol
---
FIREPROOF should be a part of any explosive build.  Honestly every build if you can fit it in.  Cant tell you how many times its saved me from an exploding car or supermutants going ham on the rocket launchers.  And if you're running an explosive shotgun the extra explosions from the pellets really require dense mods or PA so you're giving up quite a bit.  I moved from explosive shotguns to a BE submachingun and I'm not sure how I lived the other way all that time.  Kinda feel like a fool lol
---
Still works with teams, just have to have one being in the workshops area and the other player can go hunt down the workshop owner.
---
Because it‚Äôs an MMO not day z. What don‚Äôt you folks grasp about this? It was NEVER intended to be survival
---
They should really add upgrades that strap backpacks and saddle bags to PA pieces. Similar to the FO4 automatron carry weight upgrades for robots.
---
Whitesprings guardhouse, down the road from the main entrance to the bunker.
---
Wendors are nice creatures, if not little aggressive and messy. Don't try to pet them.
---
You use teams, one player contests the workshop in the team while the other player hunts them down outside of the workshop. The game just checks if there is at least one person inside the boundry. Otherwise a workshop owner could stay just outside the boundries and snipe anyone who tries to take it with impunity.
---
A lot of new people joins the survival mode thinking is like fallout 4 survival mode.
---
A fix to queen of the hunt would certainly make finding an alien for the daily and weekly atomic challenges much more doable.  In my 600 hours of playtime I have only seen the flatwoods monster twice and both times it teleported away.
---
Oh, but you clearly do. 
---
I will give you full credit for seeing that I am easily arguing you into a corner. Most people get too rage blind to notice. 
---
And the mastabatory comment isn't too far off. I am totally using the opportunity for a bit of self amusement, but if you think that I do it to make myself feel smarter or better in some way...well...that honestly makes it just a touch more funny to me.
---
Right? Sometimes multiple bugs makes it all work. "Well, it's going to take 5 minutes for my CAMP to load up, might as well reload the primary weapon. Let's switch to the secondary and see if it is loaded... ope, got that bug where it takes 10-15 seconds to switch between weapons. Oh there it is, time to reload this one. Hey, look at that! CAMP's ready!"
---
Awesome thanks
---
Just noticed it too. No noticeable changes as far as I can tell. Could be a fourth Nuclear Winter clue that has been added in somewhere.
---
I bought the disc version on PS4, and on launch day alone there was a ~50 gb "patch" you had to download.  There've been plenty more since then, so yeah I'd guess 80 GB+ with the disc not seeming to be involved much.
---
kind of geeking out a Bethesda employee saw this. Love the game since Day 1!
---
You the man!
---
the fking stairs are the bane of my existence in fallout. how tf do the stairs cause so many problems??? was initially gonna put a 3rd floor on my camp, decided that would eat up too much budget, but i had already placed the stairs...now i cant un-place them because of the 1 piece of floor that is attached to the stairs...and can i delete that 1 piece of floor? fuck no i cant because of the fucking stairs for some reason. ended up having to move my camp so that the game could break it all down all because of 1 fucking stair case. 
---
fuck stairs.
---
Owner of the workshop has to be in the area of the contested workshop.
---
I got it! Thanks though!
---
Only SeventySix - Startup.ba2 updated

IDK why update this file

Try taking radaway it lowers your diseas resistance.

I'm so defeated by your intellectual superiority! Please, have mercy!
---
I'll make sure to gift you 500 atoms when they implement mail boxes. Byeee.
---
Hi! Yes, we had a small update for PC today to address a stability issue: 
---
Agreed! The spawn rates are simply too slow/inconsistent to fill the troughs, even with multiple players in position in each biome. 
---
Played the event last night and 3 players waited 3 minutes before a single radstag spawned in A. I like a challenge, but this is getting ridiculous.
---
It kinda sucks that agility doesn't increase movement speed but i can also see why it doesn't 
---
It would destroy the PVP
---
damn that's a lot of questions.
---
I still wish we could craft special ammo, but that seems to have been relegated to legendary effects
---
Glad to see it‚Äôs a positive suggestion! It‚Äôs just great to see that the devs appreciate the work we‚Äôve done to help the game and them see the praise we give them!
---
Even if a live chat about the game isn‚Äôt possible, maybe something like a regularly updated page with sections like ‚ÄòKnown Bugs‚Äô &amp; ‚ÄòCommunity Suggestions Under Consideration‚Äô could be considered as a way to give the community (this sub especially) a clear idea of what Bethesda are looking into so it saves everyone reposting the same ideas!
---
But what if it was a egg
---
I literattly stood in the area where others say its at from sunset to sunrise and it never spawned.
---
Nope, otherwise the owner could stand just outside of the boundry and snipe anyone who tries to contest it with impunity since they aren't in the boundry area. The server only checks if there is someone actively inside the boundry contesting it. So you can use a team to bypass that.

Well it does go up to 120 from 60 but lowers energy and rad resist by 60 each, I don't own any other mod plans but I believe they all lower it's carry from 60 to 30. A lot of people seem to like the refrigeration mod but in my humble opinion I think it's best to leave it un modded, it's really just personal preference.
---
Lol, please cite your sources.
---
Imagine some guy moving and jumping around while shooting you with an explosive pistol and you can't hit him because he's way too fast
---
Well I decided to wait around on that server for a bit and came back to the dome and the plans had respawned. üòÅüëç. So I‚Äôm good to go üòâ.
---
Except sending wires through walls - this is already a thing. Conduits and advanced wiring is already in the game and work reasonably well.
---
Your just starting here to to the cranberry bog straight away
---
Thanks for this! I had no idea it was unlocked.
---
Said this myself too. It could even be a topsoil texture applied to a foundation piece that you can snap to your building, and put the fences around. I really want this.
---
Nuke Zone warning would be nice.
---
I feel like a radio station would be more fitting. Call it a distress call or a rallying signal. Kinda like Hunter/Hunted where theres a server wide alert saying "X is looking for a group"
---
You know what, fine. Keep complaining and having negative feelings. This is pointless.
---
Yeah.  Endurance is home to a number of QoL perks, but I've paired it down a bit to put more into Luck over time.  The important one for me is Radicool, because Bloodied.  But the other three - Good Doggy, Slow Metabolizer 1, and Vaccinated 1 are there simply because I want to deal with having to eat all the time.
---
Even though I have a massive stockpile of dog food now... I probably should rethink that. üòã
---
I remember someone in this sub saying they should send out a server-wide alert if you need help completing an event.
---
OK. All arguing aside. Do you actually believe that anything resembling that will ever be implemented?
---
At most all the mail boxes will do is allow you drop items into a box that won't be wiped clean when the player jumps servers or gets dumped or whatever.
---
I could build all of this for you, but I can't be on till later today. Just gonna need the materials for the X-01 calibrated shocks.
---
Hydroponic labs would be cool af. You could take plant varieties and modify them with nuclear material to create mutated variants with bonus effects. Then farm them in hydroponic irrigation systems. Fallout universe is definitely pro GMO.
---
That makes me want a hammer with a small handle
---
Thats been patched already. If owner is outside the boundry he cant damage people contesting. I tried

Isn't Unyielding Armor Expensive?
---
It works with teams, I did it last night multiple times against people doing the claim the workshop daily.
---
Passive mode. I‚Äôve learned the hard way. There are people out there who see easy caps n junk when some one accidentally hits them. Was in a nuke zone at white springs using a automatic quad Tesla rifle hit 4 or 5 players while not in passive mode and then they all turned and attacked me killed me and took my loot. I switched on passive mode. The other day I was going through about 20 or 30 different legendaries turning in script and some player just started firing on me and kept doing it so I backed out turned passive off when back on to the script machine he attacked me again I backed off let him get on and killed him took his loot and put it in my junk put passive back on and continued my scripting. He messaged me very angry and I just told him it‚Äôs probably not a smart idea to be attacking a lvl200+ player while in the middle of something just because your impatient trying to do the same thing I was doing and told him there are many other train stations if you can‚Äôt wait.
---
Wait, there's atom cards for PS4?
---
Just to clarify, bloodied weapons start to work well before 20%, but the 20% threshold adds in the last stat boost from unyielding armor, activates nerd rage, further increases bloodied weapon damage and triggers a few other low-health buffs.
---
No problem!
---
Ok thank you, do you know if the bee swarms give the disease or the Honey Beast itself?
---
Glad to help!
---
If you haven't, you should totally post this in the Forza subreddit.
---
I use bolstering, but I've been considering going unyielding because everyone raves about it lol.
---
&lt;player name&gt; level 4 is fighting level 78 radroach and needs help!

Ah that may be better than my Miller Lite delivery truck livery üò≠

If you're noticing the reduced weight of bulked scrap then you are holding too much fucking scrap.  The fraction of a fraction that bulking actually does reduce is likely an error in coding/rounding and is only noticeable if you're using the junk weight reduction perk and holding dozens and dozens if not hundreds of bulked scrap.
---
100% agree. And for the love of all that is good in the wasteland please fix the bottom of razorgrain so it clips through the ground instead of sitting on top. It looks like ass and makes my OCD go through the roof.
---
Heart of the Swamp is also broken. The "boss" will sometimes not open up, or it will stop taking damage, or it will disappear entirely and the quest goes with it, without so much as an "event failed" message.
---
Similarly, I've had events pop up before and once I've fast traveled to them, either everything flops over and dies and the quest poofs, or the quest simply goes away. I've also had timed quests fail with several seconds/over a minute left.
---
That I don't know, I just know some of the diseases are nearly impossible to catch without having your resists lowered by chems.
---
Wow! As a Crit Rifle build...this is devastating to hear. Guess I use Tormentor for now...hope this is patched.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the honey bee itself.
---
There's gear that increases specific stats right?
---
Same thing happened to me. Apparently I got the backpack the 1st time I did the event. No reward notification though.
---
I had to spray my camp for wendigos last week.  The week before, it as ninjas!  Gotta keep ahead of the infestation.
---
Because every bulking consumes plastic.  Your stash is getting two plastic lighter but whatever you're bulking stays the same.
---
Per item. A stack of 500 5.56 ammo set at 1 cap will sell that ammo @ 1c each, equaling 500 caps - the 10% "tax", so in total you should net 450 caps on a 500 caps sale. The whole stack is set price times amount. Any stacks will be this way. Now if you're talking one single item, then obviously the price set is for that one single item.
---
&gt; Possibly because you are intending to sell it to a vendor once you get to the nearest train station?
---
&gt; This exact scenario happens to me all the time. Need to trim down my stash, so I bulk up all the junk of which I have too much. Start walking to the train station
---
The same thing happened to me last night with the frat houses. Had to server hop to get the door to even appear.
---
Yep - my go to armor in nuked areas is the hazmat suit.
---
So weird they don‚Äôt display it. There was one time I completed it where the reward screen had ... at the bottom, but still no plan to learn. Weird
---
What version are you playing? If on PC I can help you out and sell you a bunch of ballistic fiber.

True, I just got the whoopsies one but it didn't take me this long. I popped one radaway during the fight, maybe if I pop more than one? Or some other chems?
---
Or just a scrapper you drop ammo in and get lead, steel, plastic back and say 90% return.
---
But mainly if some one spawned in an area just to meet and team up I‚Äôm assuming sure there would be griefers there just trying to initiate pvp I‚Äôve seen that as well usually players with some crazy gear. Other day in a nuke zone saw a player with the GT oneslickpup running around no hazmat no PA just trying to get everyone they saw to pvp. And I bit back I have some pretty decent weapons for pvp AAe hand made quad Tesla bloodied power fist. And he started it attacked me I unloaded the Tesla at point blank and watched his life go all the way down but didn‚Äôt actually go down.  I died he won and I gave up cause I have no idea how they were able to one survive in a nuke zone with no protection. Even with all the rad resistant armor rad x and rad shield you still need to be spamming radaway and stims.
---
This more than I can say. A lot of games have added color blind support (some better than others, looking at you Red Dead) and Fallout def needs to catch up.
---
Is it at least an ill tempered mutated glowing mosquito?
---
Thanks I appreciate it, I was super confused
---
I have not the only thing I have been noticing is that it doesn‚Äôt auto reload when you run out of Ammo
---
Great so crit shots are merely guaranteed shots till its fixed, also great investigating you just saved me from a wasted perk card slot!
---
It's can't even be that hard to implement either. It's literally just a filter.
---
He won't, though. Ammo is bugged. It'll generate far less than 450 caps.
---
I have a mix of rifle and heavy guns. I found the SBQ fight too daunting running a rifle build, but heavy guns (HG) aren‚Äôt good for sniping or ranged attacks. The idea is too keep your rifle build, but also have some hg perks. 
---
I will disclaim that this only possible for me due to the weapons I have. I carry a TSE lever action and a 3* Ghouls Slayer Tesla rifle. These are the only rifles I carry. For my hg I carry a 3*Vampire Gatling, 3* Furious Explosive Gatling, 3* Weightless Fatman, and a 1* Furious .50 cal. There are other weapons I mix in, but these are my favs. 
---
HG requires use of the Excavator Armor with calibrated shocks, bandolier perks, bear arms perk (I have this at 2), PA user perk, Strong Back perk (at 3 for me), and Ordinance Express (only at 1). That‚Äôs 8 perks associated only for weight  issues. I‚Äôve squeezed in Heavy Gunner at 3 leaving my Strength 12 including Traveling Farm and one more I can‚Äôt think of right now. I‚Äôll edit this. 
---
For perception I have maxed out all rifleman perks, maxed out glow sight which I swap out with tank killer, and I have the farmer perk to pick up flux at double rate. 
---
You‚Äôll also need some intelligence perks and luck perks: stabilized and one man army. 
---
It‚Äôs an investment for sure, but if you have the right weapons it‚Äôs worth it. I can stand in front of the SBQ all day with my Vampire Gatling and keep her down for the majority of the fight. I went from losing most of my SBQ fights to winning all of them. If increasing your chances of taking down bigger enemies is on your radar, then yes, the juice is worth the squeeze.
---
Quote a number are defective.
---
My fave is my fully modded shotgun at 18.9 lbs
---
And the one that's supposed to weigh 90% less (same spec) but weighs 11.2 lbs.
---
Pretty sure it has to be diseased
---
absolutely.
---
the 666 in your username allows it. my gamertag is 'six six siq' haha
---
1. Lead is special, due to a likely lucky error on Bethesda's part Lead and Aluminum are the ONLY scrap that actually lose 50% of their weight on bulking.  Pray they never fix this.
---
2. Even then you should still not be bulking that much lead.  Lead ore is INCREDIBLY easy to mine and in the right locations you can get 9-12 acid in under a minute with each server hop to break it down.
---
I use a whole set of unyielding with 3 pieces of weapon weight reduction, 1 ammo, and 1 junk. The carry weight alone is enough for me to run it full time but I have thought about adding a piece of bolstering but kind ditched that with the armor plated back pack mod. My build is kind of wacky right now (just got a couple autos so I have to sort that out) but I would call it stealth sniper/unarmed build. normally my dps on my be lever is in the 700s with nerd rage and even higher with adrenaline factored in.  I can‚Äôt use PA because of the weight reduction pieces tho so that sucks but I‚Äôve been wanting to add emergency protocols for when I can get back in successfully.
---
They might as well highlight the correct answers for the quizzes while they‚Äôre holding your hand on all the ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù. I mean they are called challenges. What kind of challenge would it be if they pointed you to exactly where it is?
---
Fort Defiance: what terminal? Where is it? I get NO quest markers, have no idea.
---
UNI: same question. No quest marker except to take me to the UNI
---
so I have simply not finished the quest despite trying a few times
---
If u r on Xbox I think there are console setrings for this and also you can Zoom the screen in those moments when you cant read ;)
---
Bloodied is running low life, usually 20% or less to take advantage of perks like nerd rage and weapons with the Bloodied name, which does more damage the lower your health. 
---
Fair warning, they require either expensive gearing, or at the least not caring if you die a lot. 
---
Here is the build I‚Äôm using atm, but I think it needs some tweaking
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f355b89&amp;d=s42sm2se2sn2pe1eu0c72cr0i44ir2a04a12l71lt2lu2ee2p10ih2sg2l20&amp;w=&amp;n=Bloodied2Hbuild&amp;m=2389cdefh
---
what are the steps in order?
---
Yeah, there's that one spot with a skeleton and a bicycle that's the junk item. Typical Bethesda fuckery. The other two locations are valid.
---
Yeah, this event really needs a party to be done properly. Done it twice now. Once me and a random, and once I lucked out and caught the event with a full assembled group already down there. I'd be down for teammates, only downside is I'm not able to be online for another 5 hours or so : ( .
---
So you prefer not running a shotgun build? Mind sharing why?
---
What about the localisation issues? Many people with different languages (mine is german) cant do missions and/or the scout badges, because we dont know what we have to do (it just lists random gibberish). Some Mobs have names like "template: long barrel" or even spoilers for upcoming contend.
---
Have you noticed some weird texture issues on the sleeves? Just asking to make sure it's not something on my end.
---
*gasp* You muenster! üò±üò≠
---
Just checkdd Mclintock. I found nothing. Either nothing spawns or i missed it
---
am i supposed to scroll over the hundreds of discovered icons on my map, hoping that one of them could be the place that i need to go? what kinda challenge is that?
---
Is there a FOREST mask or do u mean the the urban scout?
---
Survival is hella fun until you run into some spawn campers camping near something you need to do. Eff that noise, lazy twats need to go do something else for a few minutes
---
There‚Äôs a forest mask that matches the forest armor
---
You have all the links in the right sidebar of this sub.
---
I'm Deuteranopian (red-green)  deficient... And I have the absolute hardest time finding my damn paper bag! Especially in grass or something like that...
---
The current belief is that target switching resets the stack-the stacks are target-based, not player based. Misses don‚Äôt rest it though (that I verified in testing on another player back in patch 6)
---
Sounds like a good Camp idea. I still need to find neon letters.
---
Survival mode is actually pretty exhilarating if you play it as though its PvE (I don't actively hunt players down, but I'll engage them if they're in my way or coming after me). 
---
I go in to rack up mass XP through Wes-Tek runs or just try to complete the daily challenges/quests there, which inevitably puts you in the leader board. 
---
The goal is to survive and complete my run/objective while camouflaged assassins jacked up on psychobuff with explosive guns try to hunt me down. 
---
It makes adventure mode feel like a walk in the park as far as difficulty goes :P
---
I don‚Äôt ever use third person so it‚Äôs not all that important to me.
---
Not colorblind, but tons of games these days support basic "filter"-type options to accommodate different kinds of colorblindness...I know nothing is "easy" but even if they could implement something basic that would be better than nothing. :\[
---
Not at all, I've killed level 100+ players and gotten a max of 12 caps. When I get killed at level 123, I lose max 12 caps. But when I've been killed in adventure mode, its 50 caps
---
If it makes you feel better, I run away.
---
Starting with heavy deep pocketed leather armor and a shielded Vault suit would be golden! 
---
Throw in a lvl 1 BOS 308 sniper rifle and it keeps going up from there! 
---
Cards that keep you healthy or lightening your load overall are key in the beginning then work on other cards once you start leveling up. 
---
Staying in areas that will be around your level is better so you can farm easily junk and items you need! 
---
Following the Overseers journey and where that takes you instead of going off on your own. Doing events like Fertile Soil as much as you can to get rewards! 
---
Head also to WV Lumber for low level Super Mutants and farm that daily for more items and plans after scraping all the weapons you get... plus side you also get a lot of caps off them!
---
I can do it as well, just need materials. I can be on now.  Send me a pm if you want it
---
I didnt know that lol
---
Damn, I always get the wendigo and a bunch of bugs. More if an "it" anymore
---
:)
---
Yeah - the unyielding gets you carry weight, but not much damage on the actual sniper. Emergency Protocols would boost the non-melee damage a bit more.
---
I've killed level 100+ players and it's only been 12 caps, same as when I die. So I don't know what they fucked up if you should be getting up to 50
---
From what I've seen you DO get the correct amount of caps, but the notification on the screen DOESN'T indicate the proper amount/sale, it shows the purchasing players current amount of that ammo from what I understand. That being said, it's obviously not out of the realm of possibilities with 76 that different players are experiencing different outcomes/problems with vending.
---
The majority of end game players are not playing bloodied builds.
---
I'd never bring my level 100+ characters over there, but Survival is a great way to level up new characters. I brought a new toon from level 1-50 entirely in survival, and I only got killed twice. Once when I claimed Poseidon, and once when I had been on top of the leader board for over an hour and had 8k+ survival score, both of which are understandable.
---
Beyond that, it seems like people have at least a little a little honor and don't go killing relatively defenseless low level players for no reason. I ran several events with others, and even when the event protection ended they didn't gank me, they just waved and fast traveled away.
---
Alright cool.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the level 5 PVP limit has nothing to do with pacifist
---
It‚Äôs supposed to challenge you. Do I need to provide you the definition of what challenge means? Challenge: a task or situation that tests ones abilities. It‚Äôs a challenge. Not a task to complete with waypoints.
---
I have to agree with the request for a hardcore, not just a PVP Deathmatch, mode. Neither the Adventure mode or Survival mode encourages the type of behavior that you‚Äôd see in this setting: 
---
Players would have reason to cooperate and largely would. Difficult to get resources. Difficult to defend your CAMP. Difficult to take on large mobs.
---
There‚Äôd be repetitional consequences to actions, although yes - always the chance that you‚Äôd get double crossed. 
---
And there‚Äôd be permanence rather than server hopping. 
---
More like ARK or even some of the Minecraft worlds then what we have now (FWIW).
---
r u on ps4?
---
That is because of your foundation.
---
Build a new camp.
---
Play with foundation.
---
If it's too high or too low, when you attach anything, it can not longer be removed.
---
Introduced in the latest patch.
---
Hopefully fixed soon.
---
They did not.
---
Then it would be adventure mode...
---
Nah, Moo moo just sold that DDT really well. ='D
---
Well you have to know that you are dealing with bugthesda , if anything is not broken is not. Bugthesda game.
---
okay henny
---
Quick question about that event... Does a single person need to accumulate the 50 fluorescent fluids or can all of the players collect it together? I had about 25 and wanted to put it in the lighthouse but it didn't work
---
The only things that get lower in weight from scrapping is lead and aluminum. If your're bulking anything else to 'save space" you're just wasting plastic.
---
So close, but missing those sexy stylized curves!
---
This is amazing! I really hope you go far with this, it might take a while for those YouTube algorithms to start sending traffic down your way.
---
I just had a birthday and my friend told me her entire journey trying to find a way to give me a giftcard for Atoms specifically/Bethesda games generally all leading up to her just handing me a wad of $$ and telling me it was only for cute CAMP stuff lmao
---
I don't think an option exists for PC. :(
---
Wire through walls, already done, advanced power conduits. Can even send power through floor and ceiling with these conduits.
---
I vaporized myself into a blue dust cloud a few times with my Tesla...lol
---
Lots of the camera picture achievements are not working for me.
---
This is precisely why we need test dummies (like Overwatch).
---
With automatic weapons that means it's pretty much guaranteed to proc within your average burst of fire, it works really well. I can usually get a crit banked for every enemy with it.
---
Gatling plasma/laser cores are like fusion cores. If you‚Äôve been reloading your core when you have like 50 rounds left, that 50 round core goes into your inventory and you load the highest charge core in your inventory. 
---
So you‚Äôve probably just run out of high-charge cores and have a bunch of near-depleted ones left.
---
One of many reasons I don‚Äôt use the energy HW. Ballistics for life!
---
I blame duped gear for being able to kill people too easily. Not for my loses. How about that?
---
Explosive lasers are broken and need to be fixed, period. It's not possible that the design intent is to perform the way it currently does (i.e. bugged/broken) why is this so hard to understand?
---
Do you like playing a flawed game?
---
Thanks u/xatrius!
---
I am starting to see the benefit of the bloodied build, maybe I will got with the standard 2H build and then move into bloodied. Thanks again!
---
Bulking doesn't save weight on anything other than lead and aluminum.
---
Okay thank you. I did a search on here and didnt find anything.
---
at lv 25 you can start using a handmade and a lever action, both are very good for that level :)
---
I won't be able to login for a couple of day but I will add you when I get the chance.
---
I can't even respawn at vault 76. It was a major bug, I would have been fine if I could have respawned at vault 76, yeah it would have been a 10 minute jog but whatever. I just wanted all that damn junk that I spent 2 hours looting
---
The venison, kelp and goo are tied to world loot as well so it doesn‚Äôt even make sense to have more than one person on each area. The event can be completed solo with a rank 0 rad roach. But throw 3+ people in and it‚Äôs a complete clusterfuck.
---
Hunting rifle or a double-barreled shotgun
---
Fortnite has a system like this..."VBucks" purchased or earned in-game can be used by one user to buy+gift an item to a friend. I think there's restrictions like you have to have been friends for 3 days or something(?) to reduce the exploitation of hacked accounts, but you get the idea.
---
Well I want to show of my rare outfits lol
---
Summoned Minutemen if you had a nearby settlement that you had allied.
---
I began to chuckle, until I realized how real that might be... then I got the sads. :/
---
I took off all my armor and made sure I didn't have any statuses affecting the following tests. I don't use any weight reduction perks or any stat altering perks. 30 steel weighs (30 x .05) = 1.5. 30 steel + 2 plastic weighs (30 x .05) + (2 x .05) = 1.6. The game for some reason says 1 bulk steel weighs 1.5. When I drop 6 bulk steel on the ground I lose 9 carry weight. When I drop 10 bulk steel on the ground I lose 15 carry weight. If I drop 12 bulk steel on the ground (or put it in my stash) it amounts to 18. So to summarize, bulking steel saves no weight but also doesn't use up the extra weight from the plastic used to create it. Please ensure that you don't have a piece of armor with junk weight reduction on it or the Str/Pack rat perk card. This begs the question though: if the weight of plastic doesn't get added to bulk steel then are there any other junk types that are the same?
---
I use a mix, 2 unyielding (+6 stats), 2 bolstering (+70 DR/ER), and 1 chameleon piece.
---
that would be awesome. I will check mats list for the shocks. I can't remember what flux is needed. No rush, btw. Game name same as Reddit handle?
---
A slice of pie worth a goof 25,000 caps. üôÑüòÇ
---
Hopefully they‚Äôll fix that soon.
---
Orange Mentats make VATS better, Berry Mentats are the ones that highlight living things.
---
I buy mine from vendors and ammo vending machines. It‚Äôs easier than farming it
---
I mad to move around and take multiple pictures before it worked for me. It does work, it is just tricky.
---
Well at least I know it may not be intentional then lmao. Would be nicer if the 50 caps were what you actually got. Because in teams youd then get 3 or 4 caps with 3 of tou
---
Yeah instead last night I just messaged other people off the map after triggering free range and invited them to team. 
---
Only one person came to help until the end, a lowly level 28 with overencumbered problems. 
---
My point is, nobody seems to care much a lot of the time.
---
I never actually noticed that bit with the near depleted cores.  But mostly because I'm not a huge fan of the energy weapons. When ever I do snag one and I just happen to have cores, they never seem to deal enough damage (other than to ghouls or the like).  The cost of weight vs effectiveness just doesn't seem worth it.  I prefer three-clawed death-claw gauntlets and my sniper rifle.
---
FWIW, I'm 99% stats play no part in her RNG. If it did, my bloodied build with 20+ charisma (and luck) would be rolling in god tier items.
---
You actually believe they forward anything? Lol
---
Yeah I am on Xbox I'm gonna have a look now üòÄ
---
This is a great idea I need people to play with but I don‚Äôt have a set schedule or friends that play. A place in game to group would be great!
---
I run max charisma with unyielding gear at 19hp. Charisma hasn‚Äôt helped me much at all I still get crap from her all day
---
S:12, P:7, E:5, C:6, I:12, A:7, L:7.
---
Your armor is so low at that level I have to think berserker has to be a viable legendary for low level players
---
S.P.E.C.I.A.L.
---
I've played almost exclusively vats builds for well over half of my 880+hrs so far. My choices are a result of that experience so yes I am absolutely certain.
---
Stairs ruin everything. :(
---
Bethesda needs to just let us fucking delete stairs in CAMPs. With the ability to fast travel, I honestly don't even care if I spawned into someone's floating blimp CAMP, I just want to be able to build without replacing my camp 50 fucking times to get it to work. Half of the CAMPs I visit are floating anyway UGH. &gt;:\[
---
How much does that cost you? I run down to Fort Defiance and nap seven bags each time. Quick in and out names be enough to easily repair all my amour.
---
Grim reaper sprint barely ever works either . Seems like lots of stuff related to vats does not work, or works very poorly. Grs says 35 % . I have emptied multiple clips of ammo and never seen it proc . Gun fu is useless without grim reaper sprint . Not saying it never works . 1 in 100 shots procs it. That is 1% , not 35%.
---
The Circle shit is thee dumbest thing, survival mode, but hunt me down with my exact location on the map.. so stupid. If you want people to PVP in survival mode, add more players.
---
Serious question...how do you play with 15 in 3 different stats (and non-combat ones too)? That leaves like 7 or 8 points for everything else. Is a 3 at most (average between them all) enough? I'd feel so limited.
---
Yea was just thinking since i couldnt do it on my main back when i was level 3. They might have changed it.
---
Perhaps make the shovel for burried with honor respawn more frequently. Annoying that a shovel is part of my stash for this reason.
---
The best shotguns have abysmal range and ammo capacity unless its quad in which case you just lost a better dps stat.  You need dense mods or PA to not have an accident further gimping your dps.  Crafting ammo uses plastic which is way too valuable to waste on shells when nothing else uses plastic for shells.  And on a personal level they made me a sloppy shot cause I could just rely on the spread.  Maybe if they add shotgun slugs I will go back.
---
The fixer, handmade, lever action rifle ...
---
Nice to know. I‚Äôll pass. I wish Bethesda would remove all PvP from Adventure mode. Maybe the workshops would get some use again. Until then, I‚Äôll continue avoiding workshops, thanks.
---
Max out Armorer ( Rank 3: Your crafted armor has improved durability. )
---
Max out Fix it Good ( Rank 3: You can repair armor and Power Armor to 200% of normal maximum condition. )
---
Max out White Knight ( Rank 3: Your armor breaks 90% more slowly and is cheaper to repair )
---
Max out Lucky Break (  Rank 3: Chance your equipped armor will greatly repair itself when struck. )
---
Do this build and you'll never repair your armor again.
---
Southeast of Yellow Sandy's Still in the Savage Divide is an acid node. Nearby somewhere is a spawn point for random critters. I have my camp at the acid node and have seen the Flatwoods Monster about a half a dozen times upon fast traveling to my camp. If you are looking for it, it might be a place to check.
---
I am on in 2 hours! Psn same as here
---
For me they sometimes don't count when I use a camera modified with a lens. Try crafting a new one without any mods.
---
I'm on xbox :(
---
Welcome to the freakshow
---
Hide backpack and armor per piece option.
---
If you're a rifleman, there's not really a point in raising all your stats into the 30's. All of my primary stats are 20+, which is where you get the most cost/benefit.
---
1800 atoms later...
---
I've been asking this since launch. I hoped it would be fixed when Royal Jelly was needed for a recipe, but even with the cooking badge, nope. :/
---
It wasn't a problem of the bulk scrap automatically being used, the original problem was that mods were being scrapped during crafting.
---
But not in the Atomic shop...
---
I‚Äôve sent a request
---
First we need more flat land or a more robust bulldoze feature.
---
Thank you! I know...things will pick up after the iTunes podcast feed goes live. :)
---
So this is a typical scenario for some of us on PC: log in, see your friend is in the main menu although you are talking to them on discord and they say they are waiting for you to log in and join them.
---
So you relog and can join them, yay. Then you both go into a room and find that your companion is invisible now. Great. Try going out and coming back in, no dice, someone gotta relog.
---
Or hey, you are on a team but the teammate's IGN isn't on your screen, and you can't see their camp or anything. LEAVE TEAM, hope you can re-team up. Now your friend is in the main menu again, relog
---
OR
---
Maybe the game says your friend is in another world, but they are standing  next to you. BUT ARE THEY??
---
No. That is a copy paste, your friend did leave the server to go to another server but their body and gamertag are still standing next to you. Confusing! 
---
*******
---
That's just a small taste of what we go through daily
---
Thanks I appreciate it!
---
Unlike legendary weapons, armor legendary effects are a complete mess and there‚Äôs no clear tiers, that‚Äôs why you have sentinel stacked with ass and becomes a must-have magic armor for pvps. That of course also makes the naming convention nonexistent in armors. If they do the same with weapons you will have Bloodied stacked with Two-shot and the name of the weapon will be ‚ÄòExploder‚Äôs Pipe Revolver‚Äô
---
&gt; it's best to leave it un modded
---
Based on the wonderful info you shared, I'm tending to believe this too! I even choose to take the silly tadpole logo off. Wow, I'm so basic.
---
As someone looking for and selling apparel items, I would also like them to be separated. :(
---
Yeah I totally don't get why they don't do this. More money for them! I've had people say so many times they wish they could buy me something in the atom shop. 
---
I want them to buy me things in the atom shop lol! Let my more wealthy friends shower me with gifts dammit
---
You can usually find 1-2 military ammo bags per day in the bar at the Sons of Dane compound
---
Nuka Gas Station?
---
Did you calculate the critical boost before the damage boost was added from overdrive? They might not add the 15% till after the critical is calculated.
---
At least one of my characters will never wear a backpack because it completely ruins his outfit. Unfortunately, a skin won't fix the issue for that particular character (but it would for the others!). While this option would be great for people like me at the same time I didn't *need* a backpack before and I don't *need* one now so it's not a big deal. Nice QoL suggestion though!
---
Lol this post came up just after one from a stardew valley subreddit on my feed. Never thought id see such overlap
---
Fucking PC players keep games like f04 alive and yet get NO LOVE from BETH when it comes to things like this. gift cards ? man why they shaft PC players so much, we want those too
---
People are spending hundreds of dollars on weapons and armor in this game, on ebay and elsewhere, so why not
---
Yea, a full set of unyielding heavy combat armor with other good legendaries on it usually would go for 20k+ caps
---
How do you propose I buy my buddy ten dollars worth of atoms? I see no way to do that
---
Pretty sure something like vampires, two shot explosive Gatling Gun would be just completely awesome. :)
---
I feel like McClintock is hit pretty often since it's a spot people reach early in the game. What you're looking for is those green ammo bags, but since they're world objects and not container loot, you won't get them if someone else has picked them up recently.
---
The answer is to buy what you like, not what‚Äôs sold as limited. Don‚Äôt buy with fomo. I‚Äôm mad too but what can we do
---
PA? Who needs PA to solo this event? Crouch behind  the bar area in the corner and pop each one as they round the corner. 
---
And this method, it works.  I was doing it last week and a guy got on the mic and told me what to do.  Got 3 additional legendaries.
---
We can start a chain! Wendigo Inn Inc
---
So this is the bottom line?
---
----------------------------------------
---
Baseline is 60 with no neg effects.
---
Extra is 120, others are 30 all with Neg effects
---
my low level character is at lv25, 3 in charisma and 1 in luck, she has been saving her as.. of and had 196 scrip last night.
---
Went to Las Vegas, sorry, the purveyor and gambled 1 time for a 3\* ranged weapon, got a handmade lv25 explosive with + 1 perception, dont remember the last star.
---
She dose not fear any lv68 super duper mutans anymore and here old normal handmade is in the trash  :D

I tend to farm for them from the Sheepsquatch event. Its fur gives you some Ballistic Fiber.

IGN Sgt\_OKeefe. I'm on now.

Omg yes and it still casts a shadow underneath itself too drives me mental üò≠üòÇ
---
Oh snap, any advice on where to find a diseased one? Or should I server hop until it's spawns as diseased?

Added Qol features like Implementing (known) to plans we already have or more convenient way to serverhop if your campspot is taken, is just a couple of examples that were requested by the community

I am the token colorblind person on my team. Any time anyone is making a user interface, website, or powerpoint graph with colors, they come to me and ask how it looks. I am the most common red-green colorblind, and often times I have them steer away from reds and greens together to make things more readable. I'm glad they ask, but I also make them aware that there are multiple types of colorblindness, and I am just one.
---
Unyielding. No question.
---
VATS accuracy (perception)
---
Action Points and Stealth bonus (Agility)
---
Crit gain rate (luck).
---
Less direct but still quite nice are strength for carry weight (and melee backup weapons!), charisma for vendors, and intelligence for faster leveling (more int=more XP), and the higher condition on found equipment (luck- for higher sell value).
---
With enough agility/stealth, who needs bolstering? They never see you. 
---
Unyielding is hands down the best PVE bloodied sniper armor.
---
THANKS
---
The underestimate how many people used to play Farmville and are already programmed for this content.
---
Those are all the same ones I‚Äôve got so I think you‚Äôve covered them all! Except the molerat, I don‚Äôt have that one. (Thick should be changed to tick though and it‚Äôs bloodbug not bloogbug)
---
Yep, shit ain't no joke. Would be such a cool place to build otherwise!
---
And this is why I still don't take workshops , or accept random team invites . Thank you for being honest . Many of my friends have argued with me that it's safe now. I know better tho, Bethesda loves griefing. They made an achievement called good grief . Is that not clear to most players . Happy sucker hunting dude. I will be chilling witnessing the madness.
---
PA becomes a huge pain in the ass when you‚Äôve got all your eggs in the Unarmed basket.
---
YES! amen. Fences are also notoriously bad for this
---
Yea I just like to have crazy carry weight and super high stats!
---
EP doesn‚Äôt boost damage. It caps your move speed bonus (which is still lower than out of PA) and gives you 50% damage reduction. But power armor is horrible for VATS builds, it burns cores like crazy. Plus you lose all those unyielding SPECIAL benefits, plus the secondary/tertiary bonuses.
---
not really.
---
This patch failed you wanderer.
---
Some do some dont some dont care
---
This has been my complaint since Fallout 4. I'm in a walking tank that was designed to survive anything short of a nuclear blast but a dog can bite through it.
---
Campfire Tales drops plans? New to me. I've gotten all my bug plans from Stings and Things: firefly, tick, radroach, bloodbug, stingwing, and bloatfly so far.
---
Nope, my PSN name is Diggy_Dane 
---
I am fairly certain it is violet flux. That's really the only part I'll need to craft them for you.
---
I carry more with my excavator PA than without. I can carry 450 with it and only 300ish without. When I load into the game I have a nice 100 boost so I run around packing 550 until I jump out and it drops to 450 again. I carry too much crap, lol.
---
Awww drat. Sorry, I dont know too many over on that console.  I would suggest you take a look at one of the market sub reddits specifically for FO76. Some stuff is way over priced but once in a while there are some gems and of course visit as many player vendors as possible!
---
You join them while they have players waiting.  They go and attack another player, which is actually their friend, which immediately makes you hostile to them.  They kill you, then destroy your camp.  New teammate leaves.
---
unfortunately only xbone at the moment
---
Wow, that's got to be super rare, I've never met anyone with that type. I can say I sympathize with wearing glasses though, without mine I literally couldn't see the TV. Once you wear them for so long you get used to them.
---
I like the idea of going on a "wait list" that the servers can put you on. As long as you're on the server, you'll remain on the waitlist until someone comes along to join the list as well and you can get a "Your party is ready!" notification on your pip boy.
---
I do like it, im frustrated that i cannot take advantage of the bundle. 
---
Fomo?
---
Survival would work so much better if the system still generated bounties.
---
I'd like a whack-a-commie machine for my house.
---
Heading to you
---
Yes. I‚Äôm on right now if you are available.
---
ü§û
---
Fomo is an expression when something limited is available. Fear of mission out. It‚Äôs a tactic used to boost sales. So everyone buying the limited items with fear of missing out got screwed because it came back anyway and cheaper.
---
They‚Äôre just there it‚Äôs at the place you get the prototype hazmat suit, they‚Äôre really heavy too I picked up all of them and forgot about them for forever
---
oh right, theres that too. Finally my wack a commie weapon might come to use
---
1. Go to literally any gas station, supermarket, tool store, or pharmacy in America and buy a gift card. Give your friend the card or just the code. 
---
2. Enter your card numbers into your friend's machine for a one time purchase of atoms. 
---
3. Transfer your friend $10 on PayPal or something 
---
4. Hand your friend a crisp $10 bill
---
I know it's the age of technology and all, but just because there isnt a one button solution to every problem doesn't mean that it can't be done
---
So, uh, your group wanna adopt me? Lmao
---
Need to revive you in water
---
I have never gotten taxidermy plans from Campfire Tales. I have, however, gotten Firefly, Bloatfly, Bloodbug, Stingwing, Radroach, and Tick from Stings and Things. Additionally, I have not gotten a Molerat plan from Stings and Things so I'm not sure your attributing that plan to that quest is correct.
---
Then there would be a southern states easter chick hatching in full uniform ready to go to war because of an act of Northern aggression..
---
I'm pretty lucky stability is good on PS4 rn. They should fix those issues I never see them so I don't know about them.
---
Lol yeah I‚Äôve got a healthy stash.
---
Maybe a bit too much in the middle, but near Top of the World you have a nice spot; flat area, water, aluminum and your base won‚Äôt get attacked that often. It‚Äôs [here](https://imgur.com/a/ZVjRjYX) at the red circle
---
The only benefit I know of to unyielding in this case is if you're a heavy VATS user. If you can get your AGL and luck close to 30 your AP bar will refresh in a heartbeat, and your crit meter will fill every 2-3 shots. Faster if you have any of the appropriate crit perks.
---
We actually have a [Known Issues and Feedback](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/319566/fallout-76-known-issues-and-feedback?language%5B%5D=en) section as well, also as a reddit post! It used to be pinned in here, perhaps the mods can repin it sometime.
---
i think its 'gregs' terminal. use lift to top flr, in room with work benches.
---
orders 099. or something close.
---
note and holo across the corridor with acsess code 'Hope4future'
---
if you get to uni without those the quest will stall.
---
quest marker is hit and miss. marker to defiance,get there,get in,...no marker or changes to uni ???????
---
actually spent more than a week trying this.
---
once youve completed fort defiance part , head to uni and find centrifuge and terminal, the afforementioned code will unlock. it.
---
uni building with the statue in front. (there are 2 buildings).
---
dont insert the dna until you have restored power.(downstairs maintainance terminal)
---
you must have done the bos quest, its the same run but with s/b dna.
---
hope this helps a bit. Its always failed for me, but thru glitches.
---
nb. markers in the uni only visible when you get close.
---
Higher level players are gonna be defenseless against you.
---
It‚Äôs so easy to mine I get hundreds and hundreds of lead scrap on one trip, which is why I have so much bulked. I don‚Äôt hoard it, that‚Äôs just how much I got from that one farm run.
---
Simple fix - robots need to be shut down and updated üòÅ
---
Wtf, no option to save
---
This game is way way different compared to fallout 3 and slightly different from fallout 4. There's more of an emphasis on crafting and in-game economy. This essentially is the fallout mmo in a sense. It'll take some getting used to compared to other fallout games that came out recently. Plus there's no NPC people really, so be prepared to get interactions with robots and other players.
---
Make sure the likes reach 760k.
---
It didn‚Äôt ‚Äúcome from‚Äù this game.
---
I have a bloodied crit damage dragon that i still need to test but at 1% health that should do a lot more damage, especially considering dense plus fireproof basically completely nullifies the explosive part of the effect so the damage dealt is a lot lower than listed
---
&gt; Am I just going to be defenseless against higher up players?
---
Play adventure mode till you gear up and you will be fine. We're Care Bears over there. Hell you may get lucky and have a high level character roll over and help gear/chem you up.
---
&gt; However, I do want to play survival mode on it. So it's probably something I'd have to deal with.
---
Gear and grind up legendary weapons and armor. There will be a lot of high level players over there.
---
Or don't. The worst you will lose is junk and some aid items, and those are readily replaceable.
---
Have fun. Good aiming.
---
I‚Äôm not saying it gets lower in weight by bulking, but you can only sell it to a vendor if it is bulked. Bulk the junk + take it to vendor and sell it = more space in stash.
---
Have a lot of patience.
---
Everyone knows the song was written for Kingsmen 2 :)
---
Springs? Please?
---
Any update on this? I'm tempted to toss them but they've stayed in game so long; there has to be a purpose.
---
I've got a set of unyielding &amp; building a set of bolstering just so I can swap if desired. Was running a mix until I got a good deal at a vendor on an unyielding Lft Arm.
---
One thing I haven't seen mentioned is how much of a boost unyielding can give to stealth (while its working). Literally dropped down behind a mutant last night &amp; he was clueless. Almost felt bad.
---
You literally said "I am bulking it isn't really to sell it, but to make room in my stash" which is a false statement, except for lead and aluminum.
---
Fair point. I tend to build in between the Whitesprings Station and the Blackwater Mine which is about 50/50 when Whitesprings gets targeted.
---
If I'm in game and see that my CAMP is going to be in the nuke zone I'll exit the server to prevent if from being flattened. Having the same choice on joining a new server would be an option I'd like to have.
---
I may also start carrying a hazmat suit with me on the fave wheel as suggested above. I generally don't care too much about rads, until I do...
---
But it's regular spawn only for those who have already found the body and note. The camera after that spawns into every second container for some stupid reason. I just dropped 27 cameras and game gave the message of them being destroyed since it's personal item.
---
Read that all wrong, sell the handmade someone will give it a good home.
---
No idea why it won‚Äôt let me revive
---
Like the other guy said, South of the southern most silo, just west and slightly North of the fissure you'll find down there. The cave is on the lowest wall, and the lead producer is up above it.
---
Mine has always sounded when empty. I'm not sure it's meant to work any other way. It's alerting you to the location of a cap stash not caps. :)
---
I‚Äôm only intending on selling it in order to get it out of my stash to clear room. Otherwise I‚Äôd hoard all the junk ever. I don‚Äôt need the measly caps from selling junk, I need space. The best way to get space is to bulk and sell excess.
---
Cheers back at you mate. Thanks a ton, I don't know why I don't get quest markers but certain quests have always been like that since beta for me. Thanks for taking the time to write that out
---
I'm not on during the day much but feel free to add me on live and join/invite me whenever you're on. 
---
I love doing this because the sentry bots usually drop full fusion cores. When I leave I usually walk out from the shops and kill all the sentry bots and exit through the gate toward the station and get those bots too. Usually snag about 2-3 fusion cores and other junk.
---
Are they hostile to anyone/anything else nearby? That's caused it to happen to me again recently.
---
Not sure. Try Drowning and let me see if i can revive you.
---
You don't need PA. I was referring to those in PA who have to exit it to play the instruments.  What I'm saying is if you're in PA you do not need to exit your PA at all, just activate the jukebox.
---
Oh yeah you are talking about friends that you know their emails and addressses. There is no way to gift someone atoms without knowing those things is my point
---
I can honestly say I have never eaten anyone who asked for help. The rude people on the other hand...... hmmmm mmmm salty AF! Why don't you come visit us or add one of us, you might be pleasantly surpirsed. We don't bite! Much. 
---
\- PSN Darthnick
---
I always loot kid bedrooms or play areas. Their existence makes me sad, but the kids are long dead so I can use the lead from the building blocks or screws from their toy trucks to rebuild the world for the next batch of kids.
---
I shot a fox once, though, and never again. I don't feel bad killing anything else, but man I felt like a monster chasing down that passive fox.
---
Well yes, but actually no.
---
But actually yes since the version that's soaring in popularity and why it became a meme came from this game
---
That's what I thought lol.  I'll probably sell it later tonight once I get to 50 and can use the AR.  So I'm assuming it valid with weapon weight affecting the amount of hits in VATS you can have?
---
Collections? What are collections ?
---
For me, I have found that it has something to do with the Hdmi port on the xbox1x. The first symptom for me is when moving through the Hud menu's, Dolby Atmos cuts out and reconnects to dolby vision and I get a screen flash.  If i don't fix it then, the screen will eventually flash and go to static but will full audio.  If i pull the HDMI from the xbox and reconnect, it will fix the audio cutouts and act completely normal.   Happens maybe twice a week but ALWAYS after a hotfix or update.  As soon as i experience the first symptom, pull the hdmi, reconnect and its back to normal.   Also have experienced it when exiting the game but not closing the app, going back later and having to log back in, the audio output is in regular dolby vision, not atmos and cuts out for a few minutes until I connect to the server to join a world.
---
Come to grafton and let murlock kill you in shallow water
---
maybe the water isn't deep enough?
---
Exta is 120 with negatives. Others are 30 with OTHER buffs (no negatives). So backpacks are pure upgrade over no backpack; the different backpack mods are better in one area and worse in others compared to the base backpack.
---
same here. whats even more absurd.......the shovels are leveled........mine is now a lowly level 1 @ 6lbs !
---
I do think it's cool to have survival and have a threat of other players. But I just don't want to keep dying when trying to do other things lol
---
The range is what I hate. I need to get up close,but that kills me. also I can't run silencer or I have to more or less put the barrel in their mouth to kill them.
---
If your talking about badges you very likely still have them. Go check a tadpole/possum machine.
---
My Pip-Boy said 0, sure as hell possum machine said 8 &amp; I happily walked away with my fridge mod.
---
Collections sometimes don't appear. A relog usually fixes it.
---
I did, before restarting the game this time Super Duper made no sound or icon and my ammo quantity was exactly a multiple of my crafting actions with no extras.
---
After restart Super Duper worked as expected and I received extra ammo units.
---
Activate pacifist mode and don't engage in pvp which includes workshops until you have leveled up a bit. It might best to play adventure mode instead of survival too. Don't rush leveling and take your time exploring. Events are good for getting plans as well. Melee is super effective and resource efficient. Don't just put points into perks unless you are sure you will use them.
---
Yeah I kind of have an issue with saving my caps so once I can save up a decent amount I'll go searching the bazar.
---
Try relogging, it happens sometimes.
---
Or just scrap ammo option to get back 50% of resources needed to craft it.
---
Play around without starting the main quests until you are level 50 (to have leveled gears); levels between 20-40-ish are harder (IMO).
---
Do public events, get public workshops in the Forest, Toxic Valley and Ash Heap.
---
Gather/Pickup everything you find, scrap **and stash** materials, especially adhesive, spring, lead, plastic, ballistic fiber.
---
cool, yeah i'm usually on in the evening. around 6pm eastern time. i'll add you later tonight
---
Let one live
---
Well that's the problem, it's on enter, not timed.  If you don't enter the area when it's available, it won't spawn.
---
(Don't quote me on that, I haven't seen the game files, it's just the way it seemed to work for me...running out far enough and back triggered the event, or zoning in when it was the correct time period)
---
But doesn't bulking mostly increase weight? Lead is an exception though (and aluminium?)
---
You got to get over that language. Man im gerting tired of uppity fuckin people who are never happy. Its insane the entitlement of some people. You almost wonder how they make it thru life with attitudes like that? 
---
Its not a fucking house or a yacht! Its a 20 dollar game. Take a chill pill dude.
---
I FT to Kiddie Corner to start Tidy quest. Dead eyebots all over. A few seconds later they all sprang to life and ambushed me. Killed them. Walked to Scout Leader and saw Mirelurk Queen walking. She fainted.  While waiting for Scout to finish talking two Yao Guai attacked.  Killed them. While laughing at that a Deathclaw attacked.  WTF is going on with this game?
---
Let one kill u in shallow water
---
I have not seen that happen, it only takes your plastic and consumes it to make it vendor sellable.
---
Thank you! I have to say it did make it much more interesting. The stealth thing is really great for solo exploration, but I feel like I'll be spending my post 50 time building a more versatile load out. Part of the reason I went with stealth was to hide on the map, but now that I've gotten used to using area chat and playing with other people I like running into new people more than I did in the beginning.
---
Maybe I'll focus more on direct rifle combat. Not really sure at the moment but I have time to think about it. Might even step into some power armor now that I can deal with the upkeep. The sky's the limit.
---
Yeah, I guess I am implying that it would actually be your own real life friends. Didnt think of the angle that you may want to give some random stranger your hard earned dollars (or whatever currency you may use)
---
Don't worry about it. You can freely switch between the 2 modes as you like. You aren't locked in.
---
I never wear PA. I'm not a melee build, though, but yeah, between diluted RadX or Radshield, and Radaway, you have all the same functionality.
---
Like I said, one of many reasons I don‚Äôt use the energy HW ;)
---
Spin-up time sucks. 
---
Goo/ash piles can‚Äôt be searched by butcher‚Äôs bounty. 
---
Armor reducing effects are broken with energy damage (don‚Äôt work). 
---
As mentioned, Core mechanics are annoying.
---
Plasma gat has same fire rate rate as 50cal, slightly higher base damage (but worse actual damage since it hits full armor, not reduced armor) but worse recoil (harder to control sustained fire, and HW are all about sustained fire. Plus the spin-up mechanics. 
---
Laser gat is just trash. Might be equal to the minigun if armor-piercing worked for it. But the minigun is a very low bar to set- it‚Äôs very mediocre.
---
Sounds good, I'll be around.
---
It's not that 'I'm not good enough' I can do that new mission without my power armour if I'm squaded up and were sharing the right perks.
---
Please show me a video of a solo with the Quest Complete and The Boss dead- I'll pay you to show me.
---
A black powder rifle, shotguns, and power armor
---
one does get into a routine . I can hear the mutants firing, BEFORE the first turret has appeared,and the turrets are the first to appear.
---
They're stashing their caps on an alt / friend before going to survival.
---
Thank you! I'll see what I can do. I'm going to have to log more time in game to get more campfire tales lol.
---
Not random strangers, bub. But I do play quite often with people who are not about to give me their addresses, however I would like sometimes to reward someone or be rewarded by strangers, if they were so inclined.
---
1 Glass, 3 Antiseptic.
---
Agreed I get they dont want to make them impenetrable,  but come on, taking damage from insects and dogs?
---
That's incredibly hard to do because people always show up, but I'll try tonight. How much are you paying for this demand?
---
Yeah, power fist is my main weapon, though when it comes to sbq I use either an auto laser rifle or gatling plasma
---
Die in shallow
---
I use the same loadout and I like the way it looks. Looks like I have a backpack made just for holding the tank.
---
I only use Party audio on Xbox now - it seems to work fine
---
That sounds like an almost ideal harpoon gun. I personally would rather have two shot over explosive if that is possible. Either way that sounds awesome. Thanks for the reply.
---
I sits. While watching my friends build or shop
---
I relogged a few times and still zero, doesn't really matter, just wondered if others would reply with #metoo
---
Love this inst, one and done. And I live about 30 seconds out from that yogi. Oh did I "instigate" his death lol
---
vdub580
---
In your pip boy, shows a list with your Scout badges and legendary scripts total.
---
I want one of those huge REI backpacks, the kind with the metal frame that sticks way up above your head, I want to be like Cheryl Strayed in WILD with that huge pack I can barely lift
---
12 hours of server hopping in one cave, that determination alone should be rewarded with some serious atoms üëç
---
Oh, probably a visual glitch that it‚Äôs not showing how much you actually have.
---
AND, yes AND, if you WANT to find a scorchbeast.......................................................................
---
I'll go check the machine, but my Legendary Scripts should be at the at the bottom of the list.
---
The forums?
---
I'm not sure I'd want to give money to someone who doesn't trust me enough to give me a relatively anonymous email address (doesn't even have to be your main mail), but if that's your thing than far be it for me to judge. 
---
I'm not sure what you play on, but on the Playstation I can easily communicate with just normal messages. I could send a gift card code in like 4 seconds.
---
I've lost so many atoms to stuff I bought, didn't like, and never use. Early adopters are experiments in how far you can push prices. Like I don't jump on new tech anymore, used to, but it changes so fast you see something next month better and half the price. Least you're using it!
---
You need a good melee weapon for when they get close.  Executioners fist weapons was what I used back when I was shotgun spec to finish them off up close.
---
OOC are you running 3/3 enforcer?  The leg cripple then finish them off approach works well with an explosive shottie.
---
It's 300ish per bulk from vendors. I bought some during a time of crisis months ago.
---
Yeah I Play on PC. Bethesda don't gaf about PC players until their game starts falling behind in sales then they'll open it up for PC modders to save their ass but no, we can't message strangers or message ANYONE not in game on our own servers at the moment
---
The main reason I am bulking it is to make room in my stash, because the best way to make room in my stash is to completely remove the items in it. The only way to sell most junk is to do so in bulk form. I am bulking junk to make room in my stash, because selling it is the best way to clear it from my stash.
---
I can't make this any clearer for you. I need space in stash. Too much junk. Don't want to just put junk on ground. Can't sell scrap junk, only bulk junk. Bulk junk in order to sell it so I can make more room in the stash by way of not having as much in it anymore.
---
Maybe the dislikes are because the 'new' version is a remake.
---
It's a good song, but I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for the original.  The differences aren't *bad*, but they're jarring enough to kind of bring me out of the moment when I'm listening to it.
---
Sweet! I'm all for sharing knowledge
---
Hmm. Because the player base of this game want to be assholes and gang up on someone I'm the coward for not letting that happen. I doesn't have anything to do with being worried about someone seeking revenge. Let them... but when bubba and his 4 chicken banging cousins are hanging out around the corner to kill me for collecting said bounty isnt fun for me. So I avoid it.
---
I got the reward notification, so I guess it shows occasionally.
---
Sorry not currently, should a ver2 take place I'll definitely shout about it
---
What kind of weapon are you using for the SBQ?
---
Pumping iron should give you +1 strength for the same amount of time well tuned does.
---
Man, I'm sorry 
---
Seems like such an obvious thing that would need to be implemented. 
---
Come to think of it, would you even be able to buy a gift card on PC? Do Bethesda make cards for their own launcher?
---
Ok will check the others out. Checked the one in the Forest it was the Junk Item. Couldn't find the one near the Cabins in the Savage Divide but will check again. The Yao Guai there can be pretty tough though.
---
Ahhh gotcha
---
Now you know we going to have people running tricks in there if that happens..
---
Yeah. Aside from the intimidating look it gives when you walk up to someone holding one.  It losses it's lustre when you know that once being fired, it's not as damaging as it looks much less how much of a spread it gives off at any real distance.
---
Running around with a ~25lb Gatling limits to you to caring around several more effective weapons. Much less the ability to carry any loot you find along the way.
---
Is that where it keeps coming from.
---
Check out Oxhorn's video on Emmett Waste Disposal Site. It is part of the lore based around how they got rid of the bodies after experimenting on them with the FEV virus. It happens in one of the towns in FO76.
---
This is the shit beth cares about...not the fact that people have hit lvl 50 and not received the trophy.  Their response?  "Create a new character and do it again."  Uhhh no...
---
It seems that for certain mods you have to scrap items with that specific mod in order to unlock it, this applies to both weapons and armors. I‚Äôve tried to unlock all mods for some weapons by scrapping a ton of them, didn‚Äôt work. But they were unlocked as soon as I scrapped a unit that had that specific mod attached.
---
Thanks for correcting the typos. I'm missing the molerat and tick still, trying to do stings and wings to get it.
---
That looks interesting, if I'm on later I'll be sure it pop on by
---
Ill be on tonight in about 7 hrs or so if youd like to team up
---
Pharma farma is a great perk early on and max level only costs 3 points of luck
---
Yeah I'm not bulking it and putting it back in my stash, I'm bulking it and selling it. I'm making space in my stash by getting rid of it entirely. 
---
So the scenario is - stash is full, but I want to put some sort of critical item in it. New legendary to sell, more chems, whatever. I check which scrap I have way too much of, and bulk it so I can sell it. I put the critical items in the stash now that there is space. I can't put the bulk items in there in order to ensure I don't scrap it before getting to a train station; it's full again. I have to carry it on me and just remember not to scrap all before I get the opportunity to sell.
---
Is the dev team aware of and looking into the 0/5 motors crafted bug for the Early Warnings quest? It has been 6 months now and no fix...
---
I sever hopped about ten times and finally found a diseased one outside in the gift shop. It spawned with a bunch of wolves.
---
Yes, it does drop, but I'm not sure which so far... I need to do it again to understand which though.
---
Probably a semi auto build, I‚Äôm quite a fan of the lever action rifle and handmade rifle, prefer my semi auto weapons
---
Ace job love me some nuka cola. Would love it racing with that paint job on good work üëçüòÅ

I play survival only. I made a new character when survival started and that character has gotten to lvl 90 only in survival.
---
I don't have duped armors or weapons. Everything I use I found in game. My weapon is an AA Handmade. One star. And I can get to the top of leaderboards. I have never played PVP before this either.
---
My partner and I play with some honor. I will kill you but I generally won't take your loot. Unless your one of the "raiders" that camp spawn points. We like to hunt them and ruin their kill counts.
---
The other day I decided to try and hunt the No 1 guy on the map and he just ran and ran from me. If he had turned and shot he probably would have killed me. But he just ran.  I hope he continues to play survival and learn to protect himself in the wasteland.

Survival is the fallout I always wanted. You have to think about every move you make. When I get on the leaderboards I like to go someplace cool like flatwoods or white springs or pleasant valley and lure the killers to me. Where I usually kill them. But it used to be me always getting killed.
---
Now there are factions of assholes and there are people like me who try to kill them. You learn their names and root for them when they kill an asshole. There's lots of drama and beefs. Just like what would happen in a real world. Not everyone is a polite and friendly redditor irl.
---
For people getting bored with farming come to survival. It really is fun
---
Mainly run and gun! Fire a few shots, run a distant and fire a few more, helps save on my health and medical supplies!
---
I just got another hang today after drinking alcohol for Biv‚Äôs daily, but did not get a dump from it. Since it was a hang and not a CTD, I had to kill the process via Task Manager. How do I go about getting it to create a dump file in this case?
---
Nice one dude, I‚Äôll check it out!
---
In my experience nothing infuriates these players more than "shooting" back with the taunt emote. Also, taking pictures.
---
I would argue the egg cracked under pressure because of Northern aggression.
---
100% agree. The name matches the observatory's "purpose" and the space would be perfect for either deathmatch or a small Battle Royale. Think about all those little rooms, stairwells, broken ceilings etc. For a deathmatch set up. Perfect.  The survivor gets to trigger the machine and cause a weather event to delight/destroy the players in server. 
---
I'm more excited for this than any of the DLC they've dropped so far.
---
I've probably done it 100 times and only get a badge, Campfire Tales Tent, S'mores recipe, or a bunch of standard items like stimpacks and water.
---
good question lol
---
But. I wouldn't wish this hot mess on anyone who hasn't already experienced it and knows the ins and outs of the bugs and glitches. it really is a mess for some of us, and it's a random thing. I know people with superior PC builds who have the same bugs I do on my fairly good build. Some blame it on their internet connection: I have comcast, I live in an apartment where you can't get anything BUT comcast. If it's the internet doing all this, I am so fucked
---
Happens with scrips as well. Pip bpy bug. Almost said some unkind words before i went to verify at vendor.
---
I'm often a solo player, and I just can't agree. 
---
Some of the content is indeed geared towards groups, most of it in fact.
---
I knew full well that 76 was a Multiplayer game, and the content being geared towards that comes at no surprise. 
---
It's not ideal for solo players, but we bought in knowing what it was. 
---
It's like going to a burger shop and wanting them to serve more taco options.
---
That's one rad ride! ... ha ha
---
I can understand that. I've done the same when I couldn't find gears or adhesive.  Once I found locations to snag the other stuff like cans and ballistic fibre, I just go there every couple of days (actual days, not in-game days).
---
Nice one dude I‚Äôll give it a shot! Always struggled finding caps on my last play through!
---
Yeah, Stings and Things gets your Firefly, Bloat Fly, Stingwing, Radroach, and Bloodbug
---
Lying Lowe and the side quests on the bulletin board gets you the Wolf, Radstag, Yao Gui, Owlett, and the Wendigo
---
This is all that has come out so far.
---
I found them about the third time I served hopped
---
Perfect! I won‚Äôt be on until 8pm ET tonight
---
backpacks and brewing was community ideas presented on reddit too
---
Level 100 you should be able to take down a sheepsquatch.. You're doing something wrong.
---
I'm level 101 and it's pretty much easy peasy sailing.  Maybe look up how to build your character and switch around some perks. Should be pretty much slaughtering things by now.
---
I paid 4k for a 2* TSE yesterday
---
I'll take it to, but offer a few caps to sweeten the pot!
---
PS4 "Junkseller69"
---
FO 76 already suffers from enough ambiguities in language without building another in intentionally. Bulk scrap is still scrap and if all scrap is going to be scrapped, no reason not to include bulk. Perhaps annoying the first time accidentally scrap something you don't intend, but once you figure out that's going to happen you rarely make that mistake again. I don't need 'scrap all' to have an exceptions list.
---
You need to get closer to them for the tame prompt now. Everyone is inventing every sort of fake info around this problem but this is it.
---
It's a step back but still possible.
---
Source: a friend found me a sloth yesterday and i could tame it with animal friend.
---
I actually just use weightless. Then again I also use stealth so my armor is nearly irrelevant
---
I have an AR with ffr and when you put an automatic receiver on it with an ap magazine it's down right nasty...I never use it except for events cause it too easy. Base dmg isn't as high as handmade but the fire rate and being able to vats for days are great.
---
Learn early what gear does what, get mutations early on.
---
I appreciate the way you come at the topic. Agreed and supported. We should be expecting other builds to be uplifted and made more interesting and flexible, buffing certain weapons and builds and prefixes to be more useful, not tearing down a good build or two to dilute everything into an unfun game for everyone.  And I say that as someone that doesn't run a Bloodied build and never wants to. I don't want to see them nerfed. I want to see other weapons, gear, prefixes, and builds uplifted.
---
I really like Vanguard on paper but getting rads happens so easily and often and everywhere that the usefulness and uptime of tankiness in vanguard doesn't feel as rewarding as even being an unyielding/bloodied style.  Maybe if it was dependent on actual health lost from attack and didn't count rads it would be nice?
---
Yeah. I don't get that many bugs. Sometimes I get kicked (like maybe once a week) and sometimes there's a graphic glitch or something doesn't load properly but other than that it's pretty easily ignored. 
---
And I live in the country too. Not the worst internet (even though I'm also forced into Comcast) but its not lightning fast either.
---
Good to know it does show. I guess it‚Äôs dependent on if there‚Äôs room in the rewards list. When there‚Äôs too much stuff it just shows ..... with no way of knowing if the skin unlocked or not unless you manually check.
---
I will join you, gimme sec.
---
Screws. Don‚Äôt forget screws.
---
What about Campfire Tales? Does it drop any plans? I am quite sure it does but... I need to re-test.
---
Sure. PSN is str8upnobs just like Reddit. Anyone with interest in running it, I'm down as long as there's enough to feasibly do it. I'm thinking at least 5-6 people.
---
Just my own opinions, but personally, I think it helps to look at the game as a long haul and not a race to become godlike. There are elements that can seem like a tedious grind (getting/making ammo, farming for materials like screws, etc.) especially in the earlier levels when perks that help with that are not available to you. If you can keep in mind that these are mostly "growing pains," and that it's still a fun world to play in nonetheless, it helps with that. Makes the whole trip last longer than just farming XP as fast as you can. And lastly, when you get quest to "Tune in to the Top of the World" as you surely will early on, be careful about attempting to do the quests leading from that immediately. It will eventually lead to a fairly large jump in difficulty from stuff you can do in the Forest, the Toxic Valley, and eventually, the Ash Heap.
---
All that is true but the plasma gat is FUN...
---
I agree, but we can still die in less than a second if the enemy is using the right weapon.
---
Sounds like you would enjoy a rifleman build.  I'd recommend getting your hands on a handmade or a lever action and stack up on perception.  Rifleman pretty much *depends* on keeping the enemy at mid range so you may also want to put some points into agility for that purpose.
---
Please make more. It is fun to listen.
---
I saw someone make a mayan style pyramid using foundations and concrete stairs a while back. I'm not sure if you can still stack foundations or not, but maybe you could try something similar with walls, roofs, and stairs.
---
As a sneaky sniper I agree with this also. Def needed.
---
Eh, bear arms. I carry.... 3 daily-carry HW, 3 daily-carry heavy launchers. Also 2-3 toys at any one time- harpoon gun, plasma or laser gat, broadsider. Those 8-9 weapons weigh about 20lbs with bear arms.
---
I'll pay you 10k for a video of a solo that I can confirm.
---
Cry about it
---
I was wondering why in the world did that pop up.  But then I reread my remark lol.
---
I ran into a guy who had some questions and was looking for ammo. I wound up giving him a few hundred spare rounds and a spare Ultracite armor set I had laying about. Always good to lend a hand!
---
I have never came across 5-6 scorchbeasts in the Glass Caverns.  
---
protip, all you have to do is get into the cavern and find Tagerty's body.  It's near the huge opening of the cave (at the end) 
---
If you can't get by the enemies, you'll have to level up or bring help.
---
wonking, alt account of guojunhao1992
---
He, and some of the people he plays with use aim hack, and something similar to an invuln hack. You also can't assume all rocks provide cover vs some of them. They are still killable, but there will be times when you attack with a weapon that isn't damage bugged and they should definitely die, but don't. Different to sent/ass protection. I've heard it involves the agility 10% damage reduction being applied multiple times, and is a feature of the same hack that gives the aimbot.
---
It‚Äôs meant to be rough like that... it doesn‚Äôt sound bugged to me... get a few friends to lend a hand .
---
Nice one! I‚Äôve always liked the over action and handmade rifles
---
Sorry, on Xbox :(
---
Btw, if anyone has the flux, I‚Äôm happy to make serums for free on Xbox.
---
\+karma
---
Red rocket mega stop
---
Lol k
---
I will indeed!
---
How strange and interesting! What enemies typically tend to drop a lot of leather items, I wonder?
---
Oh. Thought you meant real money. I'm maxed out on caps on 2 accounts, no room sorry. I'll still see if I can do it though. The only issue would be getting enough of the food to get a level 2 or 3 friendly animal I'd think. Otherwise... pretty easy?
---
&gt;If I want to build under stairs/Tents/Vault Tec covers, place my thing BELOW the tent/stairs instead of on top of it.
---
God I hate that one with a passion. It even show green in the location I want it. Then hit place and boom, its gone. On the goddamn roof again.
---
Oh jear desus
---
Really, you can do whatever.
---
Just don‚Äôt forget that super dmg builds will end this kind of stuff, killing part of the fun.
---
See you in the wasteland!
---
Sounds good. I will catch up with you when I can. Look for friend request from onetrickhomie...
---
Oh, lol should of guessed.
---
Got a 2 star explosive zealots lmg the other day
---
And aluminum.
---
Upvoted for important relevance.   
---
Super Duper = more scraps for more caps
---
Real quick, do you know the method to putting support beams on corners and on the centers? 
---
If not I‚Äôll try and explain it (try) if this makes zero sense just YouTube it lol.
---
So say you got a square box and you want to place a support on the corners, take a half floor and put it halfway on the edge of the floor and halfway hanging off. Take your support beam and slap it right where the corners meet. Scrap the half floor. Wha la! 
---
We do need more decor though. Fridges, sinks, showers, cabinets etc as well.
---
If by reasonably well you mean "holy shit I've been fiddling with this for an hour why the hell does it refuse to place?"
---
I have never gotten the conduit through the wall to work. It never turns green, in any orientation or placement.
---
You don‚Äôt need to do that. Junkies is about ADDICTIONS, not active withdrawals. You are addicted whether or not you are in withdrawal or are ‚Äúself-medicating‚Äù.
---
You could always sneak by...
---
Yeah, it must've been bugged then. Thank you for letting me know. I was a bit upset hahaha
---
Atom cats. Yes
---
Factions. Yes.
---
Vehicles. Throw the whole post away.
---
Actually it was the War of Northern aggression ya yank
---
Yeah generally I like the different game modes and go between them from time to time. Mostly just helps me change up my approach and build a little bit. 
---
Don‚Äôt necessarily agree with all the hate.
---
You can't make it any clearer because you keep saying you are bulking to save space (which it does not do), then you are saying you save space by selling (which is why people bulk).  So it sounds like you bulk to sell your junk.
---
I just don't like the spread of misinformation.  Stating you are bulking to save space is incorrect and could mislead new players.
---
For what it's worth, the mechanics on radiation resistance are now known at least. A hazmat suit has 98% radiation reduction (works like damage reduction, probably applied before the RR calc), while PA has 15% radiation reduction per piece for a total of 90%.
---
Those can be read from the ESM (main game data file). Criticals and explosive effects need a lot more testing as they're heavily code-based mechanics.
---
Worrying? Why would you worry?
---
I say fill those rooms with hookers and black jack.
---
It drops plans, like the tent, Bowie knife skin, s'mores recipe, and occasional Oppossum badges IF you are a Oppossum scout.
---
Please enable all fallout 4 content.

Always down to help out and run events.

It's for the starters that are redditors, not just for you.
---
How is the pvp for survival mode? Can you still deny combat from someone else or do you have to defend yourself
---
There‚Äôs that ‚Äúassume‚Äù word again
---
I got a 
---
‚Ä¢suppressors harpoon gun with exploding bullets
---
‚Ä¢Two shot VATS CRITICAL Gatling laser
---
‚Ä¢Faster fire rate, Furious Gatling plasma
---
Those were the best ones so 3/6 were really good
---
Hopefully Bethesda adds this in a future update. Most of friends have moved on to other games. The ones that still play I feel get annoyed when I ask them to help me transfer stuff every couple of days. Lol
---
May I know why you don't agree with that last part? :)
---
‚ÄúMust have been‚Äù
---
Maybe because it‚Äôs harder to get kills in adventure mode I‚Äôm assuming?
---
I want a medic skin.
---
Oh ok then.
---
In this context trapper would refer to hunting trappers, not fishing trappers.
---
Is that so.  I was going on the Active Effects section in the pip boy.  Anytime I pop a psycho, under active effects it no longer says I have the withdrawal.  It only shows the positive effects but once it runs out, it shows my addiction to psycho.  I've even check under the stats section to verify it.  Is it just a visual bug like when you pop rad-x diluted and it still says suppresses mutations when it really doesn't?
---
I'll pay you $10 PayPal if that interests You?
---
I would like to echo your sentiment. Lots of nice friendly people (and one asshat) visited my camp last night and the day before. I had plenty of good stuff for sale and the prices were reasonable so my stash weight plummeted. 
---
I made a new friend who was looking for something specific and we'll talk again. I cleared out my stash while earning enough caps that when I eventually found my first Instigating lever action I could afford it easily. 
---
As for the ASSHAT she/he/it came up while I was restocking my weapon vending machine and couldn't wait the 45 seconds it would have taken me to finish pricing my latest haul. To make itselfs presence felt, I got a lovetap in the back of the head with an explosive rifle. 
---
As soon as I disengaged the vendor machine she/it dived in, while I warmed up the flaming chainsaw in its ear. She bought nothing and stole my purified water on the way out if camp as I blew fire and brimstone. 
---
I keep my game in passive mode so no point engaging. I did visit it's camp and leave a little brown paper bag on the doorstep to show my appreciation. Rant over!! 
---
Everybody else was cool!
---
PS I have two max level long bow bar flaming chainsaws for sale. Damage looks awful on them but they somehow mince the SBQ  once she lands. I was surrounded by 12 high level players and did at least 40% of the damage with my level 20 Chainsaw last time I visited fissure site prime. The more damage you do the better the rewards too.
---
400 caps each!! PC ign wellibootz
---
How do you start the Stings and Things repeatable quest? Do you just go back to the cabin with the robot?
---
Everything‚Äôs pretty clearly laid out in the Cornerstone speech.
---
Well this is 5 months old so..
---
Log cabin for sure. Also, the junk walls from FO4 with little to no restrictions on clipping. Won't happen, but a man can dream.
---
Since they fixed the addiction loss, junkies is basically the best non-low-health build effect. For my unarmed build, I‚Äôm losing 3char, 2 per, 2int, 1 agi, 10 dr. That‚Äôs if I‚Äôm not self-medicating, which makes some of those negatives vanish. For a melee build, those are very minor losses- I don‚Äôt give two shits about losing cha or per or int, 1 agi is a little bit of lost AP but oh well, and 10 dr is nothing. 
---
For that, i get 50% more base damage. You can‚Äôt beat that outside of a bloodied build; you can match it with Furious or Berserker but I consider the tradeoffs to Berserker to be FAR worse (berserker needs fixing) and Furious heavily depends on your build- it‚Äôs really only any good with a high ROF weapon because it takes 10 hits on each target to reach 50%, so in general, it‚Äôs quite a bit worse.
---
I ran into a real PvP this morning at the WS train station.  Was cashing in some legendaries after farming the golf club and 2 players miked up were trading when a team of 3 just started blasting.  The guy on the mike lost his shit and started name calling and taunting and I almost joined in the fray but was limited for time and wanted to dump some weapons and armor. 
---
Haven‚Äôt encountered too much banter in survival because quite frankly the mike sort of gives you away lol.  Some people don‚Äôt care but whatever. 
---
I almost always play solo but I do think the best way to play survival would be to team up because you could strategize kills and farming a bit differently.  Plus, you could optimize builds and weapons as a pair.  One person could have a melee and one a rifle or heavy gunner build.  That could be a lot of fun. 
---
I hated survival at first but have come to enjoy the challenges involved in it.
---
Radx best answer, sorry but hivemind going to downvote you though. 
---
Another option if you dont want to be bouncing around and sneaking instead is to not get the mutation and just use a serum for temporary purposes.
---
Sorry but trying to change the functionality of a huge fun and qol mutation many ppl enjoy just so you can have what you want comes off as very self centered.
---
Back packs are not supposed to work in PA. If they are it's a bug and will be patched..... well possibly patched....
---
Power armor removes your regular armor and the backpack.
---
Sure, I'll be on / off throughout the day - just hit me up whenever.
---
I got all leather mods by crafting level 1 light arms with armorer perk and super duper, and then scrapping them while having the scrapper perk on. Armor doesn‚Äôt have to have the mod in order to learn it, disregard the guy who told you it does
---
They need to bring back the red rocket sign and the inflatable snowman üòí
---
I know, I found this page when I searched up fun things to do besides trade, sell, and find stuff. Other ppl may too.
---
Full team? I should record us two saving all 3 or soloing the event. You need all 3 to get the diffuser. Formula P is a common drop, had the bear arm plan drop twice with 2 alive and my friend had the diffuser drop once, it's not a guaranteed thing. If you're having problems with 8, maybe scaling? We like it when noone is there. Sometimes a troll will shutdown the experiment and that makes the animals aggro, and a lot harder to complete.
---
They are already an in-game item, and they already have crops in them. So the asset and the process exist, so surely it isn‚Äôt a challenging process to add to the ‚ÄúPlans‚Äù rotation at vendors?
---
Completely agree. I like how friendly FO76 community is (one of the best I‚Äôve ever encountered) but sometimes too much is too much haha. 90% of players are so afraid of PvP, drama, beef, grief and competition. They want safe spaces 24/7. They never want to loose their precious loot and then they complain about new game content being too easy or boring.
---
Is it a separate item that can be equipped or is it all part of the outfit?
---
LMAO üòÇ
---
How long are we supposed to wait? I sent my shipping info but haven't heard anything since
---
Funny, I can read the pip boy perfectly. Can't read a single god damn note in the game.
---
Sure, just out of curiosity... why do you think it can't be done solo? Like what do you perceive as the thing preventing people from doing it?
---
Use ur mic. Get in a team. Having traveling companions makes the game 100x easier. If I'm ever looking for materials, someone in my team usually has what I need and vice versa. "Oh ur looking for springs? I have tons plz take some. You got some spare 10mm. I'll trade you for the springs."
---
What mods do you have unlocked? Some such as deep pocketd and shadowed are not available via scrapping.
---
Completely agree.
---
The fact that explosive lasers are OP is just a coincidence, the main point is that it is a flaw in the game design. However, it does and to the reasoning that it should be fixed. We deserve to play a bug free, comprehensive game that is well designed.
---
Your idea of the new transformed version of the explosive lasers sound awesome, but personally, I don't care about it's current effect, as long as it's mechanism is fixed.
---
I know this thread is kinda old, but I hear what you‚Äôre saying. When I first started this game, and all fallout titles actually, I couldn‚Äôt wait to get into some power armor. But honestly, now, I only use it for nuke zones. I respected my character for non power armor. I picked up barbarian in Strength, iron clad in endurance, and junk shield in luck. All of these perks give me an extra 160 damage resist on top of my armor. As for armor, to get the most damage resist, you have to mod it with either Shadowed, polymer or bos. I‚Äôm referring to Combat armor btw. These mods not only look cool, but are some of the strongest in the game. Also, make sure to pick up the mutation Scaly skin. That gives you an additional +50 dr/er. So if you do it right, your damage resist will be over 400!!  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs not going to keep you alive during all battles, but it‚Äôs pretty good. Does it beat power armor? No. But it‚Äôs close. Now if you get really lucky, you will find/earn good Legendary armor. Like Vanguards. With each piece of vanguard armor, it gives you an additional +35 damage and energy resist the higher your health. So if you had 5 pieces of that armor, that‚Äôs an additional + 175 damage/energy Resistance on top of your perks and armor stats and scaly skin if you have it. So that would be over 500 dr/er. Anyway, hope this helps if you even see it. Have a good one!!
---
But when I die with 18k caps I only lose 12. I killed 2 players multiple times in a row and it was 12 caps each time
---
Level 20-30 was the most painful for me. Constantly short of resources, with ambitions of a high level player but without the info/skill/perks/ weapons to really make a difference. Bit the teenage years irl.
---
Same with the travelling leather coat and marine armor and under armor jumpsuits.
---
Guild Wars did it too. Break apart balance and skill changes and damage or effect caps between PvE and PvP modes. Trying to make things work in both is how many games sink their gameplay ships.
---
The map isn't so big and fast travel isn't so expensive that we even slightly need them to add a vehicle system. And it's quite lore breaking since not a single car has ever worked in a fallout game. Plus the atom cats were founded by Zeke in the 2200s, and had absolutely nothing to do with cars. We're 200 years to early. Ya it can be argued that he stole the idea, which is my mains RP, but the cars thing just doesn't go with anything fallout
---
Just server hop until you see a diseased one - and it‚Äôs the honey beast and not the bees
---
What motors?
---
I hear people complain about locked water purifiers but the irony there is no one has ever ‚Äúpurchased‚Äù any of the zero cap purified water I have in my vending machine. I‚Äôve had some luck with healing items. Shotgun shells and mini nukes sold well so far. Frankly the ammo has been the only thing I have for sale that has felt worth the trouble. Partly because I don‚Äôt have any cool armor or weapons to sell.
---
I had an a**hat like that once too. I was apparently in his/her way so I got a back full of automatic lead. No damage so I just finished what I was doing and left it at that. Fortunately no camp-destruction revenge.
---
I think I should move my CAMP but building is so glitched I haven‚Äôt had the patience to deal with it.
---
There's no such thing as a molerat mounted plan...
---
That's .... odd. That sounds like a bug.
---
Get your caps and jump around every train station vendors for plans. That was the biggest spend for me for the first 30 levels.
---
No idea. Still haven't heard anything
---
Get a "breath underwater" armor piece and jchill at the bottom of a lake
---
I dont think I use/have the bear arms perk.  One of the problems I've had with (probably all) Fallout, I collect too much crap.  Between having a lot of items tagged for search, I tend to carry too much scrap.  I'm always afraid of dumping it then needing it right after I get rid of it.
---
I carry a Recon Hardend Piercing rifle, Large Deathclaw gauntlet, and a quad-double-barrel shotgun with exploding slugs, various grenades and body amour.  The rifle is 16lbs and the gauntlet is 13. Though they both weigh a lot, I find them more effective than any of the big Gatling.
---
Alright awesome thank you
---
Thank you! I have submitted a ticket
---
Turn your bullets around, you're shooting them with the wrong end.
---
Either the Handmade Rifle or Lever Action Rifle
---
Room for one more?!
---
I‚Äôve tamed two deathclaws, a Yao guai, and molerat since the patch so not sure what‚Äôs going on for you :(
---
Literally go fuck your cousin
---
Interesting. I noticed some performance drop when I put DOF at minimum, so I put it back up to max. I'm gonna try it at 50% and see how that goes.
---
Been playing since beta. Never seen one, but now I want to
---
I love the idea of hydroponics! Would be cool if there was some sort of quest centred around creating new mutated versions of the standard crops and then recipes that could be created with them. Kinda like the alcohol quests.
---
I have work for the next 8 or so hours but I should be able to help in like 10 or so hours if that works
---
It is quite strange, I had thought if I craft a ton and scrap them, I could unlock everything? Nope didn‚Äôt work that way for me. But for leather I think it could be dropped by anything, completely RNG.
---
You can‚Äôt be moving when u take a photo of u want it to count
---
That's how it be already. Even after they "fixed it" I'm still able to get into where vendor bots stand at train stations and stuff like that because of speed demon. If it stacked the game would crash after 30 seconds of sprinting
---
Pharma Farma is a good perk to max out early on, itll help build up your supply of meds and it only costs 3 points of luck
---
Damn and I need Shadowed, too!
---
my friends think im weird for liking 76
---
Agreed, it's hard to get all the friendlies to rank 1 never mind rank 3.  most times I'm happy to get something, anything, to rank 2 and just focus on that 1 stronger friendly surviving.
---
yeah i snuck past the ones in the Caverns but couldnt find the objective
---
Died in the mine at ash heap and could only spawn at the ski resort, that was an expensive trip getting back.
---
Again, it‚Äôs about ADDICTION, not WITHDRAWAL. When you are addicted but on the drug, you aren‚Äôt suffering withdrawals... but you are still addicted. Junkies doesn‚Äôt care about withdrawals, only addictions.
---
yeah i found the body and got everything from the inventory but the objective marker stayed on the body
---
I got the mounted tick last night from doing Stings &amp; Things at Dolly Sods last night.
---
What do you think this is? A non profit game?
---
Someone spawned the scorched beast running by all the fissure sites. There are a few spawn locations around that mission also one in the cave. If your solo run through the cave loot the body and leave
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals would like to welcome you
---
You'll be looking for an oddly placed dead body. If I recall, it is on a little raised chunk of rubble.
---
Just have fun, explore and dont read too much...It is a fun game and there is a ton to do!
---
SM used Tri-beam lasers in FO3 and Nightkin know how to utilize Stealthboys. They also know how to train attack hounds so they‚Äôre definitely far from the dimmest creatures in the lore.

Double your RAM and turn off the pagefile completly. I know thats not specific to an issue appearing since the 21st, but you will be much happier in general.

Ghoul Slayers‚Äô Gamma Gatling?
---
Cars can work in the fallout universe post war its just extremely rare. The ncr for example have multiple working trucks at mccarran. Vertibirds though not cars are have been used by the ncr,bos, enclave, and railroad. The boomers used a damn plane in the second battle of the hoover damn. Also i shpuld mention the boats and trains thst have been used in new vegas and 4
---
Like I said, I got hundreds of crap items and the moment I add a point 2 explosive decent ones?
---
It's not really  a "remake." The guy singing this version is one of the original writers of the song.
---
So do mine, and I say "IDGAFF"
---
You can also look it up on a personal terminal. And it's a daily quest so once you do it, you have to wait until you can do it again.
---
My Camp is situated between 2 fissure sites, and I highly recommend it, my Camp has been in the same location for about 3 months, and has never once failed to load in.
---
Sure the numerous enemies in the area do a lot of damage sometimes, but more often than not they end up fighting amongst themselves and my camp holds up OK, besides that, many of the enemy spawns near my Camp are frequently legendary.
---
I have suppressed mine so my electrically charged doesn‚Äôt kill low level enemies when trying to get challenge diseases like whoopsies from the mirelurk spawns
---
It would be nice if they put in the atom store, for 500-1000 a self-mountable tent like the one near the house of the pumpkins, she with the basic things, without any drinks or servo.
---
Personally, I created my module with 4 frames where I put everything except the drink furniture (with music, servo, terminal and other ornaments and still plenty of space).
---
Then apart from that luxury would be a free predefined or with cheap flat style normal tent or junk way ... although for that, well, and are large tents and put almost everything inside. I would even say that for that they were created although they could put something more variety with more straight walls to facilitate the placement of the furniture.
---
Sometimes, using schemes is too risky, I had to create 0 my base when I only needed a free foundation, a single foundation ...
---
Always!
---
10000% THIS!
---
Charleston station. That bot sells a few mod plans for leather
---
OP this is the answer.
---
I'm leveling my second character up. Currently level 20 but my other characters are Level 190. If you want to grind some events together I'm down
---
I like the absurdity of the plague doctor mask with the imposter sheepsquatch helm.
---
Okay so I play mainly with two other guys [3 total] we've all put in over 500 hours each. 
---
All of us have explosive weapons, my main dps; level 204 is bloodied, has full unyielding, has an Anti armour and a bloodied power fist and a furious explosive shotgun. Perked out for Both Shotguns and Unarmed. All it takes is one hit from anything [bear, angler, snallygaster] and he's dead. Count in the loading times from respawning and there's no way the friendlies are surviving without protection. 
---
My guy is built around Fully Auto Rifles:- I'm level 140- have all the perks for auto's- mutants explosive 10mm, executioners ffr 10mm, team medic, action boy- I play as an assist role for the Dps, unless I'm calling, he's swamped by enemies and dies. 
---
Our 3rd- level 95- fully built out for vats crits with a Furious Explosive hunting rifle, full Sentinel, popping off team medic to keep us healed. 
---
We've failed this so many times when usually we can kill imposter just us, queen just us. Im genuinely curious to see if we're doing something wrong or our builds are wrong.
---
You want wendigos?  Because that's how you get wendigos.
---
It did got back. But when I sold my stuff I also spent it on legendaries and the legendary i got I still have. So it saved the legendary I bought before the servers got  roll back. Wierd?
---
As someone else said, build another set of stairs and then delete both. I had this happen twice this past weekend. Both times it eventually let me delete the stuff. I wouldn't scrap my CAMP when this happens just give it time.
---
This, totally thought this.
---
Limited - not exclusive. They never said these items wouldn‚Äôt return. Many items that were limited have come back so. Safe to assume all the others will as well.
---
My main character is a melee/cannibal build and I really like the mole miner gauntlet, they drop very frequently from Mole miners. A good starting melee weapon for a level 15 is the ski sword which you can find a bunch at the top of the world (big red/glass dome) you can keep 1 and scrap the extras you find for parts and possible mod plans
---
I was making a joke
---
Apparently the responders fire suit works too
---
I see thanks for clearing that up.
---
I'm excited to play it!
---
The .44 gold skin has returned for like a week etc
---
There's always that one guy who comes in and shits on a post like yours, and I'm afraid I have to be him. I am making money hand-over-fist on 5mm, 5.56, .308, and .45 at 1 cap each - and shotgun at 2 caps each. There's always someone hurting for ammo who doesn't want to grind, so they'll buy it.
---
I think it has a lot to do with your caps situation, level, and game goals.
---
edit: I'm also practically sitting on Arkos, so it helps.
---
Someone say hookers and blackjack?
---
Oh okay that makes more sense. Yeah I remember my low-level days where I would be in my power armor that have to pop out every time to play the instruments. That was a course before I knew that you can just turn on the jukebox haha
---
I‚Äôve got more than two dozens of trash so far, most of them came with ‚Äòbash damage‚Äô as a star. mama murmur really wanted to bash me.
---
Swimming is also pretty easy.
---
Thank you! Would you recommend the cannibal perk for a brand new player?
---
Cool, im just annoyed i cant take advantage of the bundle.
---
It rare but possible I have tse VE FE and more LMGs
---
I know - it would be nice if they had at least separated the pip boy
---
There are only certain quest to hold off on until level 50.
---
Also they are mostly the side quests. The biggest one is "mayor for a day".
---
Other ppl will respond with other quests to hold off on, i just cant remember names atm.
---
tfw....
---
There are places you can easily build a camp without any issues.
---
I doubt your doubt.
---
It‚Äôs like rape, no consensus.
---
No we dont.. We join cause we like hard versions of games. But i didnt know there would be a leader board thst takes all the fun out of the mode. I just jump off a cliff if i get on it then get back to more tense fallout.
---
Only completed it once and can't check now, what are my chances do you think?
---
I love survival but only play it when my aid tab is sold off. My aid tab has been very heavy for a while unfortunately
---
You actually have two problems. RPG‚Äôs have always rewarded specialists. You‚Äôre spreading your perks (I assume) across 3 different types of weapon. Cut it down to 2 or preferably 1, and you may find you now perform well enough with that 1 that you don‚Äôt need others. 
---
Single shot rifles often do end up needing a backup weapon, depending on your playstyle, although my sniper only uses her revolver when her lever-action rifle breaks; the lever action has decent hip-fire (especially modded) and a good fire rate that even if something gets in your face, you can still drop it without too much trouble. 
---
My HW guy... only uses HW. Heavy launchers fall under the same perks for weight, armor piercing, and reload (although i don‚Äôt use reload), but I have allocated perks for explosive radius, explosive ammo weight, and explosive damage. 
---
My rifleman... has a knife and pistol as backups, but they‚Äôre mostly for show. All her perks and 99% of her combat is with a rifle. 
---
My melee specialist... uses mostly melee. I do have an automatic L50 The Fixer because, well, sometimes I need some range capability, but I don‚Äôt really expect to do much damage with it, it‚Äôs mostly about getting tags in group action, or having something to do when SB are flying. I have zero rifle perks.
---
And I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house down.
---
Yeah, Mayor for a Day is one that I read about last night. Thank you
---
My god, you're a fucking genius. 
---
Good shout man.
---
Specifically the Gorge Junkyard
---
Or, just scrap LOTS of garden gnomes
---
What do you play it on if it's pc I don't mind helping you a bit
---
My opinion of the what to do with survival would be to remove legendary weapons and armor. That makes it as level of a playing field as possible while still allowing you to play whatever way you like.
---
Same here.  I have not gotten a single plan from Campfire Tales.  All of my mounted insects have come from Stings &amp; Things.  So far, Operation Tidy has only given me weapon plans (Pioneer Scout bowie knife, for example).
---
There‚Äôs two different final phases. If the holotape is some girl singing about bugs, it‚Äôs 3 waves of bugs. With a legendary radscorpion in the last. If it‚Äôs the girl talking about her counselor, it‚Äôs the wendingo.
---
Not in real life.... :P
---
But sure we will take you...
---
When a group is working together even silly stuff like.. "Let me check my stash, yup, I got that cloth you need for that.." is a big deal..
---
Not everyone has the ability to collect glowing masses, or violet flux for that huge upgrade. Sometimes even just a body that can be a Rad Sponge partner in a radiation suit is the largest deal!
---
have you guys tried forming a party in the Xbox app  ( Android/ iOS?) and text chatting in there, thats how i comunicate with players in the game.
---
I really like it! I never need to worry about food, and any damage I take from ranged attacks I can heal up as soon as I melee someone to death. If you take it, you also want to either take lead belly so you don't get rads from eating corpses or take ghoulish and you'll still take radiation damage, but you'll heal more off of eating corpses. It's really just up to you if you want to stock either more stimpaks or radaway
---
I run a stealth commando build. It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs functional. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f12aec&amp;d=s01p02pg2ph2pp2pi2eh0c70ib4ir2a72ar2an2ao0a03s11l71lt2lk2lu0lv2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=24689cfi
---
Are there caps/hats for the uniforms? My dudes moustache is highly complemented by the Confederate uniform and I want to complete the look :-)
---
+karma
---
I mean, you can buy all 3 separate, but if i were to buy the pipboy skin, i will have spent 2500, whereas anyone who buys the bundle now pays 1800. I feel like i was punished for not waiting.
---
If Blackbird were to return, i wouldnt be upset to see it for higher than it originally was. I missed out. A lot missed out. And which has a lot of hype and yearning for. But maybe we should have gotten it the first time.
---
had one kind soul let me know that he'd fast traveled into my house. lucky bugger.  FT always dumps me into the river on the south side
---
My best seller's in order from most to least:
---
Recipes
---
Plans
---
Aid (radshield/antibiotics/addictol)
---
Stimpacks
---
Ammo (5.56 and shotgun)
---
Shielded under armor
---
Rare apparel
---
Low level legos
---
GOOD max level legos
---
I run a high luck build so I get plans/recipes almost every single event I complete.  Sometimes 2.
---
Also around arktos and the whitespring are where the money is but I also dont want to rebuild as my current little castle is a 14 hour build I'm not ready to reundertake.
---
Its needed for the free states
---
The Daily Ecological Balance is also glitched like this.  No matter how many times you do it - you always have to go back and get the terminal password first - but the quest chain doesn't tell you that, the markers just direct you to the terminal to upload the data.
---
Love to see a video version of inside the vault
---
When doing my last project I had the help of a Yellow/Green/Violet assistant. Wow sometimes color selection is tough. Best bet is just let the user set the colors when possible. there are some websites that let "regular" people get a feel for what colorblind peeps see.. great stuff.
---
Probably too late at that time. I sent you a PM with my gamer tag. Maybe we can find a time that works in the next few days or on the weekend. Appreciate the help. :)
---
Kill everything in sight, don't stop unless you must heal, eat, drink, or fat travel.
---
The armour used to not go over. Im also wearing a suit under the spacesuit
---
I bought a forest camo jumpsuit from a level 3 in the same type of scenario. He has a main but started on a new character and got the suit from an event. RNG, man.
---
"soon" is probably not as soon as you think it is. The first batch of new features comes at the end of nuclear winter, after the nuclear winter mode and after vault raids. If it doesn't come then, you'll have to wait until after the wastelander quest and events
---
*Takes microphone*  I'd also like to thank a few people. *Raises glass*  I'd like to thank Bethesda for putting a major event in Arkos, which is right by my long-standing homestead. Were it not for you, I'd never be earning 2-3K a day on ammo and repair mats. 
---
I'd also like to thank all the customers who saw the humor in my shelf full of frog jars and purchase Captured Frogs and Frog Jars from me daily. When I've been at my camp I've even thrown in the frog for free if I was able to catch you in time after purchasing the jar.
---
I'd like to thank the guy who sold 35 fusion cores for 15 caps each, as well as the guy who sold all his mods and notes for 5-15 caps each yesterday. I don't know what you were thinking, but I was happy to take them off your hands. Sales have been excellent.
---
I'd like to thank the customers who shut my doors or otherwise showed appreciation, walking around my camp and giving me the thumbs up. I too appreciate people who take time to explore what others have designed.
---
*Here-here!*
---
Thank you. I was going to ask if there were drawbacks. But you've explained it wunnerfully.
---
I‚Äôm in the forest area now which has the benefit of being relatively safe. But most players interested in shopping our well east of the forest.
---
Intresting, quite a detail.
---
there's going to be a lot of haters commenting on here soon. The same comment again. bunch of losers
---
just had someone call me a f\*cking c\*nt because i wouldn't trade with him &gt;\_&lt;. On the flip side, some kind soul liked my house after he let me know that fast travel let him in (FT always dumps me into the river i'm built on)
---
Do events when you can
---
I've played it solo and had to put in 75 before. As usual the event can be buggy.
---
Alpha_wolf00
---
The planter thing they had in fallout 4 with one of the workshop updates would be awesome but I dont plant stuff honestly I just want more camp stuff for decor like a bobblehead stand
---
Nuke zones are great for leveling. However if you want a less challenging experience with decent xp rates there are a couple places. 
---
Whitesprings golf club. Clear the place out, then follow the houses around whitesprings, killing all the ghouls until you end up at the super mutant shack to the north. Fast travel back to the golf club, server hop, repeat. 
---
West Tek, near that giant satellite at the center of the map, is full of super mutants. Clear it, server hop. It's a great place to collect steel, gunpowder, and grenades if you grab everything the mutants drop and scrap it. Scrapper perk required for maximum efficiency. Or you can sell all the loot to get your daily vendor caps pretty quickly.
---
Harpers Ferry is full of scorched and super mutants. Clear it out, do what you want with the loot, then head down into the Burrows to kill bucketloads of ghouls. Server hop, repeat. If you nuke this area, the burrows becomes a nest of hordes of bloated glowing ghouls, but you need a pretty solid build to clear it efficiently.
---
Depends on what build you are. I'm a melee build and I use legendaries but for a level 25 get a modified axe or super sledge.
---
There are still many game breaking bugs
---
I've seen it go nutter butters after rad-x or similar meds wear off. I've just stopped carrying the stuff since it adds practically nothing vs. the stealth rad resistance PA has natively.
---
I think it's "grant terminal". On top floor. I had that quest pop up when I was there. It's heck of thing to fast travel around, I would just ignore the whole thing.
---
Yep it's grants. After that you also need to check a holotape nearby. If the game doesn't give you the quest markers, it likely wont work anyway.
---
Looks like a relatively balanced build - you can do a little of everything, and your specialty is in building stuff.  
---
Brains /and/ brawn :)
---
While all the points in "I" allow you to make and repair good weapons, but that's likely at the expense of perks to maximize the damage done by those good weapons.
---
Personally, I would move a few points from I to S and/or P.
---
S for Melee or hefting heavy weapons, and carrying the ammo, P for rifle and shotgun accuracy and damage.
---
 I know its a PITA to swap perks in an out for crafting and selling vs adventuring....
---
High Charisma helps in a team; how often do you play team vs play solo?  
---
The high "I" indicates you probably the ability to repair to 200%  So it will generally take a really long time for stuff to break.  Given that, logically, you won't really need luck of the draw/lucky break points.  You can move those..maybe to E, which is stuff to help you live longer or take more damage before dying. (unless you want to play a bloodied build, where you want to constantly be low health...)
---
Also with the current system of leaderboard and being marked on the map... all it does is encourage griefers.  I had some dude track me down in my base (i had no idea I was even on the board, I‚Äôd only been in the server for 5 minutes working on the weapon challenge), 1shot me from the back, and then proceeded to try and wipe out my shack before I logged off. That‚Äôs not survival, that‚Äôs just griefing. 
---
Getting rid of the map markers would go a LONG way towards fixing survival. What purpose do they serve other than some bullshit battle royale thing?
---
The leaderboard is fine on it‚Äôs own.
---
The handmade and assault rifle are two of those worst vats weapons. They both cost around 31 AP per shot. The combat and radium rifles are better at only 26 AP per shot. Slap an auto receiver on those and you get down to 13 AP per shot.
---
From what I gather, weight does not effect AP cost. At least, the weight reduction perk cards don't seem to change anything.
---
You should name it Seymour, because like Fry's dog, it'll be waiting for quite some time.
---
Do you have Rad Worms? It works as intended now, so it becomes a real problem in Nuke Zones.
---
I‚Äôm holding onto my level 5 Instigating Explosive Hunting rifle for just this reason.
---
I recently reinstalled the game on my PS4. I also have a physical copy. After the the game installed from the disk, it occupied around 45 gb of space. Then my PS4 started downloading the latest update which was around 55 gb in size. After the download finished the was occupying a little over 60 gb.
---
There's also Scorchbeast, and Scorchbeast Queen, which I don't see listed.
---
Yes, I believe they are either at Phillipi Cemetary or the fort just north of there. I ended up with the plan for crafting the Union hat, but it was so long ago I don't remember where i got it from.
---
I'm in the forest as well.  My build does not have room for a single turret, luckily where I am I only ever get attacked by bees.  Everything else is neutral that spawns (foxes, cats, frogs, fireflies etc)  This does in fact hurt my business.  I mean some nights it's really quiet for like an hour then out of nowhere I get like 15 sales at once so fast youd think I was nailing that cash register.
---
Great thanks how do you sever hop now as it was changed so you get put back in the same server
---
Legendaries lol
---
Add me: Arkenith
---
Got it.  Relax.  Don't have to get all CAPS ON EVERYTHING BECAUSE OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS.
---
Yes to an extent, try using rad x, rad x dilluted and any other rad resist meds you have access to as well.
---
Remember rad x normal will suppress any mutation you have for like 10 min.
---
Second, check diseases to see if you have rad worms, that can be annoying as well.
---
You mean gas station letters? If so, I've got the plans.
---
Shot a level 5 guy he had a explosive rounds gun i was level 60 or something he shot first with a low level pipe gun then when i shot back at him he took out his explosive rounds and that was that for me
---
If you're on PC, you can change your PipBoy colors with a simple .ini edit.
---
It has the side-effect of changing Terminal font-color and your flashlight color too.
---
The upgraded motors spawn at the campsite by the overlook NW of Monongah Power Plant.  Perhaps elsewhere as well.  Maybe you can complete this without crafting?
---
The guy was likely running an unyielding bloody rifle build like myself, I can pull very close to 30 perception. The range in which the red dot shows up on your compass is directly effected by your perception. So all the guy had to do was spin in a circle and look for your red dot
---
One thing I know is certain that the legendary effects will be similar so test the water by getting a few legendaries in the wild, that‚Äôs why I used all 400 script. Got one explosive, I could expect another.
---
One of the key things I've taught them to be more accessible to colorblind people is to not rely on color alone, use symbols/shapes as well. Different colored circles can be difficult, but if they are different shapes as well (stop sign for red, warning sign for yellow, etc) will communicate the same information to both colorblind and not. They've started doing this everywhere.
---
Dayz is mmo. It's mmorpg too. You just have to make your own quests/factions ect.
---
Dayz has 1 thing that no other game has. The most nerve racking decisions about where to get water/is this guy going to try to eat me? No game is 30 years has made me so tense. Its not long stretch to want some of that in our favorite alternative universe.
---
Thanks for the input.  I will definitely be testing this out tonight.
---
I sometimes spawn in locked rooms. What I do next is fast travel away and run like hell to their place. I myself leave everything unlocked except for the generator room and the supply room (in the future it will hold all my food items inside)
---
Hopefully once we get displays and camp decorating, players won't be able to find a way to grab your stuff or find an exploit to do so. I will hunt down anyone who steals my collectables of magazines, comics, books, bobbleheads, and trophies. I want to make it where my shop is a museum to show my hardships and struggles to find things.
---
I want to spawn at my steps or in my home.
---
Charisma only works with pricing..which..has no effect with the purveyor whatsoever
---
Thank you fir bringing proof i made a post about this about a month ago people told me im stupid and crazy and ignored me... i knew crit bonuses dont work im not crazy
---
You can Pacify him but I've never been Able to tame him..... Or anything else for that matter.
---
Thanks for this! I would love to get the mounted cat head .... I wonder if anyone knows where that one comes from?
---
T60 is best for rad resistance.
---
Agreed. Backpack plus gas tank from engineer outfit looks bad. One or the other needs to be hidden.
---
If you are on Ps4 I will buy it
---
Do a hybrid, it is a mix between melee and gun builds. Works like a charm.
---
For some reason I was thinking Survival mode was basically FO4's survival mode with PVP. Harder enemies, no fast travel, etc. Guess not, so yeah fuck Survival mode then if the only challenge comes from not getting ganked.
---
Like I said I only completed it maybe 4 times and have it, but don‚Äôt know anything about the drop chances. Fingers crossed for ya!
---
I checked to see if I did but it doesnt seem like it.
---
I didn‚Äôt. I just capped the words that you didn‚Äôt catch the first time. To help with your understanding.
---
We really need a "looking for group" radio station.
---
Was lucky enough to get Formula P with that completion, hope i got that too
---
Ahhhh ok, my bad. So you can't even give one to somebody that needs it? Dayum
---
Sounds good! Should be home in a few hours
---
Is there mounted  deathclaw?
---
I really doubt that it‚Äôs going to be a literal reset. I can only imagine the screaming if players lose the ability to use all the gear they‚Äôve been grinding for.
---
That's where my camp is!!  I was looking for wood in the area a couple days ago and I got attacked by wolves that were glowing purple, which did seem strange.  I'm halfway through killing them, when out floats one not-so-friendly Zetan.  First time I'd seen it since hour two of playing, months ago.
---
one should know the rules of survival before engaging.
---
The MooPlex!
---
I'm pretty sure they changed that. I have no issue server hopping.
---
The MOOnsault!
---
Wasn't  the guys build that I found annoying ( that 30 perception sounds nuts) but the fact the compass gives out your exact direction even when I have just spawned and in sneak mode, it's a death sentence when against someone who's built like predator with an op gun and has more range who can burst you down before they are in your range.
---
The damage bonuses to low level players are ridiculous. I even went as far as changing all my blinker fluids and equipping the sky hook... they still walk all over me.
---
Yes I test water and hop server when I get a junk item, and that always landed me another junk item. Rather than the effects, it‚Äôs the items that always come in bundles, often two in a row. So far I‚Äôve got two radiums, two pipe revolvers, two 10mm SMGs, two auto grenade launchers, all came consecutively with crappy prefixes. What you got there was super rare üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
---
No, the disk does install the full base game. However, the first 2 patches for the game included 5 gb of changes and fixes. However, the problem was that Bethesda used a weird patching method that required users to redownload the full game with the patched files. Look it up, this caused major backlash for Bethesda. Bethesda responded by promising to make future updates smaller in size which they have.
---
I buy every .45 I see at 1 cap each. If you want to sell ammo the price better be decent people! Coz everyone know you wouldn't be selling it if you had a use for it!
---
I would like to know how they did this
---
Does rad resist armor not stack? because I know I have 3 or 4 that have 20-25% rad resist, mostly Maine type- i just haven't tried them out yet
---
you made me think...match making for events would be perfect. Maybe use terminals, pip boys, etc to "queue up" for a selected event. When enough players have queued up, the event starts
---
Also feel free to add me. GT: Kingdropbear97
---
 The halloween candy event at watago high school.
---
This is a pretty solid run for leveling up. The only place I‚Äôd add is Fort Defiance.
---
I painfully agree. Endless nights cleaning out my Fisto bargaining for a handful of screws...
---
Is this the source of the ground textures in the Ash Heap looking like snow from time to time?
---
By hard version of the game do you mean getting instant killed??
---
Legendary wood right.. +1 No Huff and Puff, +Cinders Explode
---
Which platform ya on ?
---
No thank you! I like to carry about 100 lbs of aid - just in case. 3* weight reduction armor halves this number to something manageable. This is why is have never and probably will never click Survival (beta). Or if I do go crazy some day and somehow decide to take the plunge,  I'll probably forget to turn off pacifist mode....
---
From my experience yes. Since disabling Enlighten, snow no longer exists!
---
Yeah man the games been out for so long you'll see a lot of people like that who can't handle the ppl like themselves with min maxed builds so they specifically target workshops because they have limited pvp in adventure to such an extent its one of the only reliable ways to grief ppl. I used to spend a lot of time killing ppl like that who enjoy preying on people who can't fight back but now it's too difficult with the new pvp rules.
---
Not even a melee player here myself. But after over 200 lvl's of playtime, imho that's really THE only one worth holding off for. All Rise is a really solid melee weapon. I can't name one other original quest given weapon/armor that's anywhere near it's league. Voice of Set is ok, but not great (.44 pistol, does +dmg to robots). Blade of Bastet is meh imo. I say just go have fun, and save Mayor for a Day for later. Just my .02 though.
---
Awesome. I'm assuming that means the awful LOD textures are fixed, as well? Thanks so much for posting!
---
I use a glowing blood pack that can be made at the chemistry bench under healing it's not very complicated. It helps to control the rads but it's not perfect.
---
Why two players? This could be done alone or with four players, but everyone gets the same amount of jelly, yes?

Lol yeah, my ammo is always 1 cap and I would go cheaper if I could.  Weighs too damn much to sit on forever.  Never could sell .45 ammo though and now that I run a BE submachine gun I literally cant cause I need it.  5.56 sells off the shelf.  Sometimes faster than I can put it in the machine and fast travel away.
---
Same for me too, I found the password on the fourth floor at the fort.
---
You're a clown if you play this game LOL.
---
I run fast and play Bloodied. It‚Äôs tough but it works.
---
Get you somma these as soon as you learn the recipe. Way stronger than rad-x, cheap to make and they don't mess with your mutations. https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/RadShield
---
It's been a thing since the vendor was available.
---
Effecting  the AH and some armor.
---
Except it doesn‚Äôt scrap all scrap, beer bottles, death claw hands...
---
If they are garbage people will not buy them!
---
 I have no problem selling good items for over 5k. Best sale was 15k for a sentinel assassin chest after the nerf.
---
Would also be cool if you could have a community quest board in there as well. Could be simple stuff like body guard services or just rewards if brought certain items.
---
Once you pick it up, it doesn't spawn again for some time. Player 1 is spawning it in, 2 comes in after and picks it up.
---
Yup know bug. It happens to the assaultron heads and any wood armor over 1star from the purveyor
---
I'm not sure if this is related, but after the patch all of my fusion cores were gone. Also, all of my vending items returned to my stash and I had to re-post them. Super aggravating :(
---
That‚Äôs what I was going to say. I haven‚Äôt seen a single person with a mounted Molerat head yet.
---
Good stuff should sell, but there's always people that want something for nothing.
---
Yea just because they are 3* doesnt mean they are good or worth much
---
Thanks for the heads up. I ended up scrapping it for scrip. Such a cool effect though too üò≠
---
I'm looking at the wiki for full suit rad resist values and it looks like X-01 is the highest at a total of 453 vs T-60 with 415. Ultracite has a total of 393... I guess I'll be making an X-01 suit now...
---
It cracked me up when I saw it.
---
I have a pair on me all the time. A lvl 50 executioners Gatling  Plasma prime and an FE Gatling Plasma  prime. I melt the shit out of anything dumb enough to engage in a hurry. I'll use the FE on larger legendaries like the sheepsquatch til the regen and swap over to executioners quick and absolutely murder it. Scorched beasts, even level 90+ have a sub 5 second lifespan if they land...
---
Cores are a problem, but its a USER problem. Don't reload them like your using a ballistic weapon. Eventually you'll pay for that.
---
Are you sure you have played in last 2 months? because I've had it and then after they patched it all I have not had any of listed issues.
---
T-60 is **much** cheaper to repair. It's what I use for radzones
---
It's a shame really because I think it would make getting revenge or workshop battles a lot more thrilling and nerve racking if you didn't know where exactly the other person was or coming from
---
I think people are just getting pickier/snootier. I sold a 3* Gatling laser for 5k last week, and a 2* vampires LMG for $2500. With the purveyor people probably assume they can roll better weapons than the ones you sell, even though it's still the same RNG. I'm sure your prices are just fine. I've seen slot of 1* for sale lately for under 100, I buy them all for scrip. Maybe people see that and just assume everything should be cheap now.
---
That's not how it works. That data is already on client side, there's no need to contact server at all for app...
---
Given that C-B &gt; B-A, it seems more likely that cases A and B are accidentally in the right ballpark but the assumed formula breaks down for C.
---
My best guess is that the crit bonus bypasses the DR calc, and this crit damage is dependent on a weapon base damage value rather than either the post-DR damage or the pip-boy damage. How exactly does your test rifle stack to 100 damage?
---
For what it's worth, the calculation of the crit damage multiplier in the ESM would appear to be:
---
(2 + 0.4 (better crits)) \* (1 + 0.25 (eagle eyes) + 0.15 (overdrive))
---
Can't be sure about the 2.
---
Yeah that's exactly what I mean by that lol. Compared to something like stairs placement, conduits work perfectly.
---
Yet it's still 79.99 Cad at Walmart here in Canada
---
Does this on the slopped roofs as well, sometimes.
---
You got it from a Civil War Reenactor, random event spawn. Check daily just south of the Overseer's Camp, they spawn there fairly often. 
---
You can get plans for:
---
Confederate Hat and Uniform 
---
Union Hat and Uniform
---
Civil War Era Suit 
---
Civil War Top Hat
---
Civil War Era Dress
---
The grind for backpacks is helpimg to keep numbers up. That's the entire point.
---
It‚Äôs an online game. Players knew/know that this feature would be coming. If they can‚Äôt deal with the idea. Then maybe online games aren‚Äôt  for them. 
---
From what I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs a choice reset. Giving you something for doing so. Maybe it‚Äôs a chance to get the 4* items. Maybe it‚Äôs a passive perk card. Who knows. 
---
Maybe a soft reset is what the game needs. People starting back at 1-2 will force out old builds and open doors for new ones as well.
---
are you on ps4 if so check out my account and feel free to visit me some time
---
The lead vocal is performed by Scout Ford, who is excellent, but is not one of the original writers. The song itself is absolutely a remake, produced by Copilot Music and Sound‚Äîessentially a music factory for the gaming and entertainment industries. They also produced the remake of Gold Dust Woman for Dishonored 2. 
---
This isn‚Äôt intended as a knock on it in any way, it‚Äôs excellent all around.
---
Xbox. I guess I should have mentioned that. But I truly appreciate it.
---
I am on ps4. Will be on later today. I'll pm you then.
---
\#A. if you haven't left the server yet. try going to the next objective and using the terminal. When I did this mission, the quest marker was bugged. (that was many updates ago.) #B. did you kill that last scorched beast in the cavern? it's actually an objective. It doesn't help that you have to finish the mission in one go, or that you have to start over again upon disconnect. I can help you if you're on \[xbox\] I'm not on at the moment, but I could log on to help. (gt Deviant Monster) lmk!
---
Jesus Christ man I play for hours a day and yes this shit is going on all the time
---
No.  It is a static object that can only be looted by a single player.  Once a player loots the item they cannot spawn that item into the world for 24 hours.  But if the item is spawned by some who has not looted it, it will be there and another player can loot it.
---
Proboscis are needed for the scount daily.
---
You're checking vendor camps, right? I almost always see flux.
---
Contesting workshops.
---
I‚Äôve found that deleting flooring in the order it was originally placed fixes this issue. So just try and figure out what piece you dropped first or trial and error remove a piece that‚Äôs close to it. That solved my issues when I dismantled my entire base piece by piece when player vending came out and I decided to rebuild it differently.
---
Cook, repair, build too. It all adds up! All you need to cook everything you find is lots if wood scraps and boiled water. Walk south of Vault 76 picking up from every log you see. You'll eventually get to a lumbar yard! Talk to the robots at the yard for 20 more, pickup every piece if wood. Woodchuck perk in luck pretty much doubles the wood- I got 400 wood scraps last time I did this. Pick up water from Rivers way faster than hand pumps. Pick up flowers and veg every time you can. Craft every recipe you know. Sell the excess (yes you get XP for selling). Caps and XP for days without a shot fired.
---
Workshops
---
like? the only __game breaker__ im aware of RN is the one that locks you out of your character if the camp does not place and the guy "in your spot" logs out with you nearby
---
The purifier pictured needs to be given to the people who purchased the small corvega one. Anything less is basically false advertising.
---
Leave and rejoin the game = server hop
---
I play solo and have no group, but I'm supposed to revive an ally before I'm allowed to own a backpack?
---
Todd Howard: I said you could play any way you wanted, I didn't say you'd be able to play *the whole game*...
---
I mean 100% is still a percent. It is annoying though, I jumped in to level up last night and ended up losing l of my disease cure and calmex(?), which isn't the biggest deal but still incredibly annoying to lose All of it.
---
I like this version better than John Denver‚Äôs, but the best version in my opinion was by Toots and the Maytals on their 1973 record, ‚ÄúIn The Dark‚Äù.
---
wel not really necessary to mention that in this post no worries
---
no problem btw when i was that level i used to grind the jail dont know how its called (eastern region jail) or something and the charleston area
---
All my stuff related to that are ok. But yet again I‚Äôve had learnt plans just poof. My energy weapons character is now missing both his laser and plasma guns I was able to craft.
---
There are lot of things out there in the world that we just can't do in our camps. I would love to leave a stack of cash on my bed or place magazines on a coffee table. I wish they had the medicine cabinet for us to store just our medical supplies in. The list could go on but some of these things just won't work.
---
In my opinion, no. There's a whole 'nother game mode for that now. I imagine that if one wanted to PvP, they'd go where there are like minded folks-which would be the PvP mode. Not only that, but seems like Bethesda is actually trying to encourage the same idea by nerfing damage to other players while in PvE and also not allowing damage to ones C.A.M.P. structures unless they are currently agro to the person attempting to cause the damage.
---
Agreed, this is annoying as hell. Mr fuzzy hats and Nuka Cola outfits are not armor and not what I'm looking for.
---
Does it? I can be at 800 weight, bulk a bunch of stuff (not like about 50-60 plastic worth - so not much weight lost there) and then be down to 750 even after putting all the bulk back into my stash.
---
It's not a bug, but a feature. Fallout Infinite, lol. Sorry just had to say it. Haven't had this particular bug myself. Does this occur at every time you use the work bench? Perhaps using the bench somewhere else?
---
Not everyone is kill on site. 98% of you don't even realize you've been in my cross hairs.
---
Go to a used game store, and look for copies of the game. Open the case, and take a picture of the code insert for 500 atoms with your phone. Do it with every copy you see, take them home, check the codes.
---
Sweet home Alabama
---
I once found a guy charging 2c each for things like copper, aluminum, steel and so on.
---
He also priced bulk the same way. 2c each. 
---
And that's the story on why I still carry my schoolbus power armor around still.
---
Vendors being broken, combat stuttering which creates teleporting enemies, constant crashes, my items disappearing. But no, no issues, my game perfect, Bethesda the best!
---
The proboscis can absolutely be scrapped. I found farming Campfire Tales a great way to make acid. Like someone else said it's also used for the repellent in the Stings and Things daily. Still no clue what the cricket gland does though!
---
Ok now this is hilarious
---
Yeah man I have an explosive lvl 5 pipe rifle lined up for when I reroll my main :)
---
Think of it like what they did in call duty black ops. You get to level 50 then you can choose to make your character reset to level one but you keep everything including all of your perk cards. Just have to level back up to level 50 to use everything again which is pretty easy and will supposedly prove extra benefits as well. Mainly would use it for fixing character builds or changing them.
---
Very strange, me and my brother had this all all the time and it stopped for us both...
---
Maybe try resetting game ini files could help?
---
It has an armor rating, so it could fit under armor (pun intended)
---
Gonna play the minority here, but a good modded laser rifle or plasma. By level 25 you should have amassed a small pile of cells or cartridges. The damage is low compared to ballistic guns. But the burn and the weight per gun is good.
---
My group is PC too.
---
Join up..
---
Even when you have lots of regular people 1/2 of the group might want to do this the others do that so there is always room..
---
PC "Farplace"
---
Same. I just miss the tank, it went along a lot better with my steampunk-style look.
---
This would be great. If a little detail could be added too, like a terminal you sign in on under a category. Questing, Exploring, Boss Hunting, or whatever.
---
Purveyor update stated they have pushed back the display case by a few weeks.
---
We are going past that now.
---
Hopefully soon.
---
Someone mentioned they wouldn't put it past Bethesda to release it at e3 so they can say "available today" and everyone get happy.
---
I'm hoping soon.
---
Or the Aquagirl perk. Or power armour.
---
Games have conditioned me to think the same.
---
I've gotten a level 35 I think last night.  But I've been hoping for a level 50 one.
---
Thank you.
---
I would also like the stairs to stack onto each other so you can build staircases.  I have a build in mind but cannot do it because they won‚Äôt stack.
---
Cranberry relish, Well Rested, and the Leader bobblehead paired with the farming routes above will increase XP.
---
Oooooo kill em!
---
They're synths
---
We were told specifically that solo and group play were equally viable, and that the entire game was accessible through either approach. If this is ok, then there should be content for players than only play solo and no one should complain about it.
---
Glad you like to build and look forward to seeing what you accomplish. Unfortunately Bethesda really sucks at fixing their broken ass game though. Going to grow old and grey before this game has even half the issues ironed out.
---
Oops you're absolutely right. Seems like I was thinking of something else that cannot be scrapped 
---
Great idea to farm acid at the Campfire Tales
---
You consider getting those lenses for glasses that help see colors?
---
IDK about Templates, but I'm liking bus, trailer, and van's as buildable c.a.m.p. items.
---
If people wanted a Workshop they would server hop and grab it from an un-owned location.
---
Grabbing an owned Workshop seems more like getting the PvP is the primary goal.
---
If they removed the leaderboards, it would be perfect for me!
---
Seriously dude? It's not strange, it's the norm for many of us. I've reinstalled/repaired/you name it, i've tried everything. It's not me or my computer, it's the servers and the game
---
Don't you have to test each person to find out if they are a commie first? I hear Camp McClintock calling, they want to take away your Solider papers!
---
As far as I can tell from the ESM, the mutation is both individually stronger than the perk card and multiplies the effects of it. You'd see a smaller difference between "just Eagle Eyes" and "just Better Criticals". I'm not sure what the intention was, but arguably Eagle Eyes is the bugged one.
---
Yes! Mine bugged out like crazy last night. I would get part way through a core and then it would jump to 0. Reload. Almost empty it. Say it's out. Reload. I ended up using all my full cores down partially and now I have 30-some partial cores in my inventory. I never manually reloaded at all. Some of the cores  have only a percentage or 2 left.
---
It depends on 3*. People usually sell 3* trash legendary rolls for 500 or less caps, to make scrip. You cant expect people will buy a Nocturnal Walking Cane for 2k
---
The guy below you says otherwise.
---
I'm not familiar with that issue, but if it's related to textures, then it may make improvements.
---
I like it
---
That would the best case use of prestige. I‚Äôd love to see the option to use your animated perk cards at any level. Being that they are special. You should still have to level into your perks. No need to give Overpowering players free reign. By level 100 you should have your primary build maxed or at least have enough points saved up to fix your build. 
---
I could see every time you prestige you gain 1% to legendary drop chance and it maxing out at 5%. Meaning 5 prestige. Maybe adding tiers to prestige offering other stuff.
---
The stairs stack. Always have. 
---
Just placed the stairs, then climb up, and snap the same stairs to the top.
---
There is a cabin in the game that has one of those in it and you can build in the cabin. You can't use the stupid game though, just like we can't bowl or golf although we could have in Fallout 4
---
What?
---
# The damage bonuses to low level players are ridiculous. I even went as far as changing all my blinker fluids and equipping the sky hook... they still walk all over me.
---
Cat burglar scorchbeast?
---
Haha! The new feature from Bethesda. Now serving a life sentence at a workbench near you.
---
Not every time. Honestly, I notice it most when I‚Äôm flying through the actions on a workbench. You know, when you know exactly what you have to do. Like on a weapons workbench, repairing a weapon and pushing ‚ÄúO‚Äù on the PS4 controller quickly to get out of the workbench to go back to playing. That‚Äôs when it seems to do it mostly. But it‚Äôs a habit that‚Äôs hard to break. Lol
---
Scrapping the 4 filled up shops I had and rebuilding them solved it for me.
---
Uh, yes there is, did you even listen to OP? He wants it to be a third party app that isn't part of the game itself. Talking about wanting to add a server that scrapes all inventories.
---
Not on xbox, on PC, there is zero way to communicate outside of voice chat.
---
can you still play? yes? not game __BREAKING__
---
__where did i say bug free? i specifically said there are still bugs.__  hell i even mentioned the active game breaker.  i think you want r/fallout with this attitude.  
---
1. combat stutter: not seeing where you ruled out your ISP. any other tests ran? is it system related stutter? background tasks eating ram? download in background? RULE OUT VARIABLES
---
2. vendors broken: 1 minor bug where you need to reapply vendor items, one __unconfirmed__ where you do not receive the item? hardly game breaking unless part 2 is confirmed
---
3. crashing: i have yet to crash for months outside arktos, at arktos you have a point and its well known.
---
"bethesda worst dev ever, *jerk jerk jerk*"
---
the¬†Falloutfranchise,¬†cites Bill Danoff¬†as the artist behind the¬†Fallout 76¬†version of ‚ÄúCountry Roads.‚Äù At first glance, that makes sense since Danoff was one of the co-writers behind the original Denver classic.
---
Can you wear a visible back pack with it or it wont show because of its hood on the back?
---
It saves like .2 lbs per bulk of steel.
---
You can tell who is used to being a spawn camper on survival mode...when they come to adventure mode and sit around WS blasting people that walk by , eff off with that crap
---
Great thanks is there a fixed location for the leader bobblehead
---
The event was.  Complete The Path to Enlightenment naked.  Thats what lead to this. =D
---
&gt; Apparel: Fixed an issue in which some Apparel items were incorrectly providing +1 Damage Resistance when equipped.
---
This was actually a pretty cool bug. You could get up to +5 DR with all the apparel equipped. My hat, sunglasses, bandana, suit, and wedding band each had +1 DR until this patch.  
---
It's not much, but it was something extra that was nice to have.
---
You like killing things then having them fly where you cant loot them? Makes sense. Its really realistic too!
---
Survival is fun for just pvp. I say this because say you‚Äôre out trying to get loot off non player enemies and then you die respawn at a station get killed again and maybe again yr bag is out in the middle of fuck all nowhere and you gotta book it back to there. I have 2 characters. One for pve and one for pvp. My pvp player has minimal stuff I barely carry aid I never have many caps and I only carry the weapons and armor i need. I try to stash junk ASAP if I have it. I don‚Äôt have the gear I need exactly but I do have some pretty nice weapons just for pvp. Aae hand made tse hand made quad ffr less vats Tesla and a bloodied death claw gauntlet. My build is all agility luck and perception. Sneaky commando. Try it out you‚Äôll enjoy it. I still die I still kill I hunt players because that‚Äôs what the game wants you to do. I only take what I want out of bags like stealth boys rad away and stims.  If I get other chems I usually just take them right then and there. If I get a kill streak I tend to fast travel away pretty much right after because at that point they all know where I am. The amount of caps you gain and loose are so low now that I find a lot of pvp players have gone to adventure to try and engage just to make more caps and steal players loot.  
---
All of this being said I totally recognize some players that are one either really good at it or two have some kind of exploit/insane gear. Legacy weapons are absolutely insane. First time I got killed by an explosive energy weapon I invited the guy to a party just to ask him wtf he was using because I was honestly amazed. I give props to the players who are really good at it because I feel that after almost 700 hours I have a pretty good understanding of the game I watch a lot of YouTube videos I‚Äôm on reddit all the time I pay attention to the game on a lot of different social media or what ever. Obviously sent/assassins was out of this world. Post nerf of the gear I would say it‚Äôs not as viable until the other day in adventure in a nuke zone seeing a player run around with no PA and trying to antagonize everyone to engage. I finally bit with my pve player and I have some super high dps weapons. 4 shots with a quad explosive harpoon from close up and still no damage?!  Ok he killed me. I log off grab my pvp player go back in find him wait for him to attack me I unload 60 rounds out of my auto quad Tesla see his heath go all the way down but just grey out. He hops in place and kills me instantly. Now I‚Äôm like wtf. I know the armor got nerfed but how is he in the nuke zone no pa or hazmat and killing me like it was nothing and taking no damage at all. Of course I thought he has some exploit or something that I‚Äôm not aware of. I don‚Äôt know. But dying the second time I just didn‚Äôt bother anymore because I obviously can‚Äôt kill the guy. Those are the players that make people whine about the game and how it needs balance. I don‚Äôt think anything besides nerfing it even more is gonna balance the game. Some people just spend hours grinding for caps and buying gear to be the best pvp player. Don‚Äôt let random teams or solo players ruin your experience. Join a different server or move on. I promise there is fun to be had. You‚Äôre always gonna run into people who are better or worse then you. Any one over level 50 can have the best build and absolutely destroy in pvp but die constantly in pve.
---
I'm a clown. =D
---
Try to replicate the loop by going through the steps you normally do in the work bench one by one. Maybe it's a specific action or item used in the bench that triggers this. If you can repeat it then I suggest blasting Bethesda to fix this bug
---
Totally agree with the stuff you said.
---
But there is actually a way to send wires through walls. Don‚Äòt know the english name for it, but it‚Äòs some kind of bent metalpipe with a powerconnector between it. It‚Äòs not the prettiest or most convenient way to do it, but it works.
---
No I absolutely love the physics. It's funny watching them fly on a tent/wall whatnot and be all limp. I even saved a few video clips on my ps4 because it was hilarious how they flew or fell. I'd honestly be pretty disappointed if they changed that.
---
That‚Äôs the problem. Your connection matters as to when you can access the wheel. The rads are not the issue but why waste radaway and radx if you don‚Äôt have too. Or even if you don‚Äôt have either. 
---
Adding a simple 10-15 second immunity shield would fix the problem.
---
It does work for steel as well. Someone just checked it because they didn't believe me. unbulked the total weight is 1.6 for all the steel and plastic, bulked it is 1.5
---
Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt mind them releasing it a bit later than expected. Better delayed than broken. Thanks.
---
There's way too much junk to scrap in the wasteland. You get used to it, though. Your brain does the translating. I don't even see the junk. All I see is screws,¬†lead, plastic...
---
we just need light pillars for legendary corpses
---
Imma be real with you chief.  There is no reason for PVP in adventure, esp when there are assholes out there trying to trigger PvP by hitting players to set off the unstable isotope or electrically charged mutations.
---
Yeah exactly. There just trolling trying to get you to bite. And notice that they won‚Äôt ever trade. EVER.  They won‚Äôt show you what they have for some reason it‚Äôs like they are using something or doing some exploit and it‚Äôs honestly frustrating. I‚Äôm only curious cause I want to learn.
---
I believe they're all random unfortunately. With just well rested and relish you'll be getting +15% so, the bobblehead is just the icing on the cake.
---
Any corpse that gets gibbed or falls somewhere you cant get to just wait a few minutes and it will transform into a meat pile PRECISELY where you killed it.  This includes mobs clipping through walls or falling through drains. This has 100% worked for me too on the ISS too if he gltches.  Hope that helps.
---
Yes, most of the junk items you can bulk that weigh .03 tend to at the least break even or give a slight weight reduction.
---
I wear the Ritual Bindings outfit, and none of them go well with it, but I like the utility of having it.
---
As a Stealth Sniper Character, what I really want is Ghillie Suits, there should be at least 3 variants, 1 for Forest/Mire, 1 for Toxic Valley/Savage Divide, and 1 for Cranberry Bog, the Hunter's Long Coat is good for the Ash heap.
---
Ghillie Suits need to be a quest Item like the backpacks, and should increase Stealth.
---
Thanks, it's going to be a while before I get to grips with this I must admit, even the snapping is broken lol and I've got to get so many plans still but I'll persevere :)
---
That's how I do it. Spawns you right there, hey the work shop is mine for the taking again? How nice. Server hop until someone owns it or is around. I'm not a PvPer so this is my way around it. It is what it is.
---
This issue literally drove me away for 3 months.. still not fixed.  
---
Then monday night I finally went to bulk up the excess to sell. grabbed what I wanted to bulk and went to work... Took me almost all my plastic (430) before I realized I was bulking everything in my inventory AND stash... so now I have to scrap a bunch of what I bulked... :-|  
---
An easy fix to this would be to fix the bug they introduced or just let vendors buy non-bulked items. 
---
It doesn't make sense anyway as some items they buy non bulked anyway. I am sure it has to do with fractional cap values, but there has to be a middle ground somewhere.
---
Give me a way to be rid of all this .38 in a useful manner!
---
My god this store.... what an adventure
---
That is the same build captain noob runs, correct? I based my build off his but tweaked some things
---
I've never had this happen to me, it only happens on players with power armor, and its pretty enjoyable :P
---
...&lt;screams internally&gt; 
---
Coolcoolcool woulda been good to know before uh level 32
---
If it were simple you think it would have been implemented by now...
---
I have NO idea. Like I‚Äôve tried it using rad ex full marine with +25 rad resist on all pieces and RadShield and the endurance perk maxed out. Still getting a ton of rads. Even if you had Rad sponge maxed you‚Äôre gonna need to be next to others at all times and spamming radaway.
---
At a camp, you can look up and accept dailies?
---
I love this.
---
It isn‚Äôt the first time I‚Äôve seen it.
---
Agreed! Much love to the wasteland shoppers!
---
 And anyone in the market for a boat load of Ultracite 5mm, I'm your guy. Recently un-primed my Furious Gatling Gun, and am sitting on around 14k rounds of it. Been only putting in 3.5k of it into my vending machines @ 2c per, as to not hit the cap limit if someone decides to go ham on it. So alas, if anyone is in need of it come get it. Also, depending on my caps situation at the moment, and my availability I will refill immediately after the 1st 3.5k is purchased. If someone mssg's me beforehand, and I can make arrangements to move some caps, I may even be willing to bulk sale the whole lot @ 1c per. PSN str8upnobs.
---
I love this idea. There are so many rooms in the WS that don‚Äôt have any functionality. Granted some are probably for future DLC but. Theatre: watching player made short clips. The room after the bar on the second floor would make a great location for a LFT hub.
---
Disarm can chimes
---
Its why I have a Bloodied Auto Grenade Launcher. To distribute the bits well. Makes the flowers grow. ;)
---
Maybe it is when not counting the plastic but at least this is how it was before: Copper bulk weigh more than same amount of copper as scrap. I only bulk lead to save space
---
Ok that's fine :). How do you get relish?
---
This is especially noticeable on scorch beasts, when they fall after death, they always bounce up and away.
---
Right now it's for griefers who get bored getting one shot in survival mode to server hop looking for workshops to contest, then once they gank the owner, move on to next server before the victim can even respawn.
---
They call themselves "raider roleplayers" and you a "carebear" for not liking it
---
Griefing.
---
Workshop pvp is lame, if your contesting a workshop you only want to pvp. If your only doing it to pvp why not go to survival.
---
Way easier to server hop if you really want that workshop.
---
I play with people who just love to build, they used to take workshops in order to build. Now they dont, bethesda should start looking at fallout 4 and how much people enjoyed settlement building rather than forcing pvp. 
---
Believe it or not but my friends who build spend more atoms because they want the newest rug or what not, they are also very much into the outfits an pa on sale. My pvp and hc pve barely even use atom earned in game.
---
Oh and i understand the claiming workshop is also agreeing to pvp mr. #raiderlyf.
---
Found mine at fort McKinney
---
Same, once I got the pw one time I didn't have to get it again.  The quest is still a bit buggy for me.  It activates most of the time when I go near watoga train station, sometimes it goes away and I can't reactivate it.  For example if I jump servers or crash.
---
For the love of Atom, if the item shows as green I should be able to build it.  I can't count how many times I get an error message when I'm trying to build something that shows as green.  Seems like a pretty easy thing, if I can't build it/place it, it should be red.
---
Steel scrap weights 0.05 each, 30 of them are required to make bulk steel which weights 1.5 each.  Plastic weights 0.1 each.  The 0.2 you are saving is the plastic that you are using up to make the bulk steel.
---
I roll with the nuka cola backpack skin on my arktos lab coat with medical goggles. Think it looks hilarious!
---
Which is still a weight savings.
---
Ok thank you so much for your help :). One last question what is relish?
---
Yea it effects damage at range. A hunter rifle shot at distance does less damage then closer range and to far means it won't do any damage.
---
I feel like you neither understand the terms "asset" nor "open world."
---
Sounds easy enough... until you change it on people that have played for 200+ hours. Then they get to retrain muscle memory and routines... Nothing a few thousand plastic can't fix!
---
This game is enough of a grindfest I don't need to server hop for an hour a day to regain plastic.
---
*Look at you, having friends and shit!*
---
That hasn‚Äôt been my experience hunting for it. I believe it‚Äôs a server-side 24hr timer, not a player-side timer. I‚Äôve gone days without seeing it behind the cabins. 
---
It may be a combo of not spawning for you for 24hrs AND only spawning once every 24 per server, IDK, but I‚Äôve done several server hops a day for 3-4 days without seeing it spawn in.
---
I would so enjoy crop planters. Or a leveled dirt plot.
---
The backpack doesn‚Äôt show when I‚Äôm in my NukaGirl outfit. ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
So, I'm level 380 with a few other level 60-100 alts, and bunch of level 50+ mules. I'm a full bloodied heavy weapons power armor build. I wrote a guide on it with several variations for group vs. solo play, and a new "nearly immortal" variation I'm testing right now that is so far very promising (I can sit at the lowest HP breakpoint for maximum damage on bloodied / adrenal, which is 4% HP and not die). 
---
I play solo 95% of the time. I mean, people show up when I nuke prime, but it's rare that anyone really contributes much. Still, even when the entire server shows up and half of them afk for the fight, I can take down SBQ in 3-4 minutes at most. The only times I die are when I'm purposefully dying to get a revive so I can pop Revenant for that sweet 50% damage boost for 2 minutes.
---
I don't mean to belittle your builds or efforts, but frankly.. the idea of dying during the Arktos event with my build is laughable to me. I mean sure, if I'm afk I guess it could happen. And I'm quite confident that I do dps on par with a BSS meathook build, but I'm not squishy.
---
Build guide is here, it's pretty extensive:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/blw1y6/the_bloodied_heavy_weapons_tank_an_end_game_pve/
---
The devs are reading a script passed down from the bosses. They aren‚Äôt about to skip something for a idea that doesn‚Äôt effect the $.
---
Think about all the ideas that players have asked for but still are floating around in purgatory because the devs are following the bullets on the page. Account banks, more weapon skins, so on so forth. 
---
At least this is a feature that probably exist in the game code and doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúseem‚Äù needed to them.
---
My kids were getting a kick out of it.
---
&gt;Oh hey look!  There's a level 2 with low health, we should follow him around and try to kill him indirectly.
---
&gt;Hmm he's not dying, so determined and fresh to the world!
---
&gt;Almost dead... no!  He killed everything in the building!
---
The middle mountain one is literally inside a picnic basket by the grave. But the spawn for it seems very funky. I‚Äôve gone days without seeing it spawned there. 
---
Same with tanagara town, but I don‚Äôt try that one often, it‚Äôs really slow to go check it!
---
I would just put it on torso 99% of the time and only change it rarely for high lvl mobs..
---
but.. liberators.. use vats on a liberator and it counts as head so the next mob type its still on head.. blah...
---
thats why I stopped using it...
---
Cranberry relish is an in-game learned recipe. When eaten it provides a +10% xp boost. You'll need non diseased cranberries and a few other items to cook it.
---
Join us!
---
Same thing happened to me last week! Mine was the ultracite Gatling plasma and those cores are hard to make!
---
Not true at all. There are still specific tiers for primary, major, and minor effects. See below:
---
You seem to not realize cryengine is also being used for Star Citizen which is absolutely open world to the point it is actually open universe with zero load screens from a planet to the next planet.
---
You can get bloatfly, tick, and bloodbug mounted plans from stings and things
---
Wow 0o0 I has no idea thsnk you so much.
---
Dang and nobody sells those lol RIP
---
I remember some guy trying to engage me in PVP and asking me what my build was. Why would I tell you my weaknesses? jfc
---
Bye
---
Re: your last, Not anymore, at least not on PC in my experience. Game has been rock solid for at least a month for me.
---
You're getting an upvote because I think Eddie Izzard is hilarious :)
---
Same
---
All those handmade fans.
---
The black shovel backpack goes pretty good with the drifter and the new stalker outfit. I could imagine that I would go well with the leather coat as well, but sadly I don‚Äôt own one. 
---
Might be worth 500 if your atoms
---
I can take down a sheepsquatch, that's not the issue. Don't know what I've said that made you think that. I can't take down the imposter sheepsquatch, and I can't keep the brahmin alive in the free range event.
---
No. That would break the rules of no non-cosmetic items in the atomic shop. This would be a useful item, rather than cosmetic.
---
Tips that helped me work around the current camp issues.
---
1) before doing anything, place your foundation and attach a metal stairs. If the stairs is able to be removed, continue. If the stairs can not be removed, start over and adjust how high or low you place your foundation. Too high or too low causes the"iitem would be floating/structure needs support" errors. Foundation has to be just right and nothing will be locked into place.
---
2) after foundation is good and you can attach and remove items --- start building from the top down. Currently, nothing can be placed above stairs. Floors, walls, decorations, nothing. Work around this by placing your stairs in an area you DO NOT want it to stay. Build your upper floor. Then go back to the lower floor and move the stairs to the location you want it. Then back to the upper floor to fill in the area you couldn't due to the original stairs.
---
3) use advanced power conduits to run wires through walls, floors and ceilings. You could turn a section of wall into a door, run the wire through the door then turn it back into a wall.... I have experienced issues with this glitch that cuts power off, says items are intersecting when they aren't and more. Suggest using the built in method of the advanced power conduits.
---
4) hook up vendors to a switch behind locked doors. One of the new griefing methods is to turn your vendors off if on a switch. If it's behind locked doors they can't without becoming wanted... Then you have an open invitation to kill them and take their junk. üòÅ
---
QoL tip for anyone visiting... If you place a decon shower, put it on a keypad switch and put the code below it. I've had people turn the shower on and leave which stops people running unyeilding, bloodied and/or mutations from entering my camp cause the shower would take their benefits away. Keypad switch auto turns off after a few seconds.
---
I did a bit of type type on the internets and it seems that around about 8.5ish% of people in the world are colorblind and about 5% are deaf.
---
Given that deaf people don't generally have or take up hobbies that involve sound as a primary function of said hobby....
---
But yes, give us text chat, just don't try and make it a "disabled person" issue.
---
It's happened to me too
---
Maybe Bethesda should finish building all the rooms and let us explore all 6 floors.
---
Then if we ever go to visit Greenbriar, we'd know what to expect
---
There are, I think he‚Äôs talking more about how the tier‚Äôs are balanced, as well as how there‚Äôs bugs with how names get applied (primary effect should be the name of the armor, but you can have secondary or even tertiary effects dictating it, like Poisoner‚Äôs armor (I‚Äôm not sure about tertiary‚Äôs changing the name actually, but I know I have some Poisoner‚Äôs labeled armor, and poisoner‚Äôs is a secondary effect)
---
I live in the forest near Flatwoods, I'm level 138 and I never get high level spawns.
---
Also plague doctor mask did nothing to protect the wearer from disease 
---
The mask protects them from their patients so they could get away with selling false cures
---
Survival mode atm is.  Get in, get your weekly weapon asap, than gtfo asap.  The top comments explained the current state of pvp and I pretty much feel the same way.  Friends and I are loving the normal adventure mode, and playing lots of it.   CHR ftw
---
Yeah I've got some chroma glasses that let me see normal colours. But I don't actually need them apart from my blindness my sight is fine. I just want them to have a colour blind option so I don't have to wear glasses constantly üòÄ
---
Excellent!
---
They have melons growing in a planter in the new event, could they just let us build that in our base too?
---
PS4
---
Got a full set of unyielding combat armor (with BS mod), took me 2 months to complete.
---
I mean it's the 21^st Century.
---
Why in the world would you make a 100% ONLINE game....with no freaking text chat in the first place.
---
I understand cutting corners (where's the "16 times the detail"?) but come on, no text chat....
---
On the side note of cutting corners, I guarantee you that the real reason behind there being no NPC's in the game is that Todd didn't want to fork over money on all the extra voice actors.
---
Plenty of deaf players play video games, especially online multiplayer games, specifically because they have text chat and they can play with non deaf people without anyone even knowing they are deaf.
---
Also, you really shouldn't be trying to pull that when I literally have family members who are deaf who want to play this game but can't due to the lack of text chat. Not to mention literally color blind people have asked for the pipboy fix less than 24 hours ago. 
---
You know those % are also about the percents of gay people in america, should we just say screw it about gay marriage since they only make up a small minority as well?
---
It just stays on the head for me. The only time it changes is if it's a 2 headed thing and then it changes but otherwise headshots all day.
---
Don't worry, I'm sure it will be Atom Store exclusive.
---
Oh ok. Ill try again tonight when I get on.
---
Ugh, what a bummer. Used to get it reliably off of Raiders back when the Fallout had humans.
---
Yep, what he said.
---
Damn. That‚Äôs crazy that it took you that long. I‚Äôve been farming for weeks and haven‚Äôt been lucky so I came on reddit to see if I can get lucky lol
---
What is your carry weight without your armor on? Are you over encumbered? Your armor is ‚Äúunequipped‚Äù when you die and if that puts you overweight, your spawn options get very, very limited
---
I would happily play it if the aid items dropped on death either didn't exist or just wasn't so horrendously broken.
---
Yeah, outside of nukes zones in the Forest I never see a high level mob. I have a crap 10mm just so I can kill stuff there without wasting shotgun shells.
---
Anytime! Happy grinding my friend.
---
Nah, it would make it suck, the -2 perception
---
Nice one dude!
---
The game was advertised as both though... so if a restaurant advertises as a burger and taco joint but only offer one basic ass taco and a bunch of gourmet burgers damn straight I'd suggest they add more tacos to the menu.
---
Class freak reduces the str reduction to one point, which is a whopping 5 lbs.
---
This is after the fact of being killed and being in adventure mode trying to actually talk to them and obviously the guy killed me. You can‚Äôt see people‚Äôs stats or perks. I only wanted to know his gear. Because if he still had full sent/assassins I would have been blown away that it was still working that well I have a full set of sentinel but not assassins and also a full set of cavilers. I get the not wanting to share your build. Usually you can tell based off of people‚Äôs weapons. I have a new build I‚Äôm going to try out just for team play and be a tank full endurance max hp and all charisma and luck. Only heavy combat armor and full modded xo1 full bullet sponge 9 points in strength just to max out either heavy weapons or melee
---
Forget the goblin slayer I am the ghoul slayer 
---
XD
---
I didn't find the constant loop of the top 3 killing each other fun. I made a new character and a level 100+ kept killing me over and over.  i even holstered my weapon so i wouldnt appear hostile. one time that was kinda fun was when i finally hit level 3. i was checking in at responders terminal and shooting breaks out cuz of Fertile Soil. I stayed in a corner for a while l, shooting wouldnt stop. I went out and some level 4 was barely hanging on. I helped, knowing full well this person could kill me. After they were safe, there was a moment of us staring and then I emote a wave and we go our seperate ways. Had this ended in us fighting each other, I think it would've still been fun for me since we hsd some of the "is it gonna pop off" drama.  I was hoping for more of that. Instead it's an instantly let's go kill top 3.
---
You need to be more self-confident in your dress. Own it.
---
yes.  it's in the settings.  that's enough help for you to find out how to increase it yourself.
---
Ah, **third party** app, that would do that would be against ToS/EULA  as you are prohibited from scanning your own memory.
---
First party apps are an interesting legal black hole though, but scanning own memory is still against ToS/EULA.
---
I would have already done that app if not for that.
---
p.s. Good luck finding F76 ToS/EULA =)
---
Yeah but Rose is in the Divide, so a low level person shouldn't really be working on her anyway. 
---
Pretty good rule of thumb, if the things you're fighting for a quest massively outlevel you, and you can't survive them, try a different quest. Level up in low level areas before tackling high level areas. 
---
It does suck that the game kind of points you in a direction, which keeps getting more difficult. But this is a Bethesda Fallout, they fully intend you to explore each location and do side quest stuff and not just focus on the Main Quest.
---
I love survival, minus the PVP. If PVP wasn‚Äôt included, I‚Äôd play it all the time as it‚Äôs much more enjoyable.
---
But you lose the plastic, you could achieve the same thing by just tossing your components on the ground.
---
Bethesda hasn't provided any information along this line, and all testing that points to this being a thing at all are the works of individuals from thousands of loot drops across hundreds of servers.   
---
Bluntly speaking, there's no way to know. r
---
[This](https://gph.is/2LLiHYo) is all I could think of... SNL Herlihy Boy.
---
"Bethesda... Please let me sell my backpacks. I take a lot of pride in them. They're real good quality, I promise. Just, please let me sell my backpacks!"
---
The queen event gives a guaranteed 2* heavy combat piece, ive probably dropped 10+ sets of unyeilding from that, only kept unyeilding strength pieces. If you want a set just kill the queen 20-30 times and you should get at least a few pieces
---
8. I got tick plan from there supposed to say 8 not 1.
---
Obligatory "KEK" here
---
Yup. One of many examples of lazy, incompetent game design from the devs. I've lost two of my best weapons this way.
---
üò±üò±üò± do you want to help me do the event? lol
---
I commented on the other post that the trend that I have found that these Magic Servers have is that on every one a Nuke has been launched and has or is in the process of subsiding, and players have been active on the server for at least 4 hours.
---
I don't believe it's 'magical' or a bug, I believe it's loads of enemies being killed on the server allowing new ones to spawn in and roll the dice on spawning as Legendary again.
---
I've been staying on Nuked servers as long as possible and the "Tell" is that Diseased Ghouls spawn at WS in large numbers and Legendaries show up when I take the scenic route and walk through the Bog and Mire without Fast Travelling. 
---
Yesterday's haul alone was 30-1*, 15-2**, and 4-3*** and I didn't buy any from the Purveyor.
---
This is what I have been experiencing, perhaps others will test things out and elaborate about their findings. :)
---
You can find them during SBQ event. If you dont want to launch a nuke, can find a Megasloth corpse near fisure sites, and inside cristal cavern you will find some cave cricket bodies. Just wait to the name of the creature spawns in your lens when you're aiming with camera, otherwise it won't count
---
I‚Äôm grateful for sure. Can‚Äôt imagine how long it would have taken otherwise. Once I acquire enough resources and level up, I plan on giving back for sure!
---
I have a full set of assassin's sentinel I traded for. I am sure it was orginally duped then bought off e-bay because I saw ads for it on there... 50 to 80 bucks! Crazy. Anyhow, it's great in adventure mode, PVP it is worthless because they all know how to stagger you. I keep it because it's good in pve. I'd trade it for cavalier's though
---
Yea Idk man
---
I mean, sometimes even I've used grenades on lvl 1 scorched and they don't die
---
Except if you drop them on the ground you don't get to keep them for use later.
---
It's called Ultracite Ammo..
---
there's a lot more but im not sure they are already dropping
---
I love this game.  I love this community and this subreddit.  I love Bethesda for plugging away at the game and keeping it going, smashing bugs, implementing QOL improvements and new content.
---
Are you on pc? I do it with a pretty large group so im sure you could join us when we do, though we've been doing less now that arktos and encryptid exist
---
Do a bounce between Mothman (foot of the statue) Whitespring (hood of the red car) and the Teacup.  Check all three before you hop.
---
With Travel Agent and decent CHR, it‚Äôs not too expensive.
---
Pretty good
---
Depends on the effect we are talking about. I‚Äôve been told by someone who seemed knowledgeable that at a certain point, the str bonus to damage halved (from 5% to 2.5%), and then halved again (2.5% to 1.25%) at another point. I want to say it was 20 and 40 str. To be clear, I haven‚Äôt tried to verify this. 
---
The benefit you get with vendors from Charisma is capped, but it‚Äôs not strictly a max point you can take charisma to, it‚Äôs that you can‚Äôt get more than X reduced price, from whatever combo of charisma, perks, and chems that you use. 
---
Other passives like crit gain from agility also follow some regressive formula; the higher your agility, the less boost each point gives to your crit gain rate. 
---
But some things are always a flat gain- action points from agility seems flat, carry weight from str seems flat, hp from endurance seems flat. 
---
I don‚Äôt have a full and complete list on me; i may be able to dig something up later but not now.
---
Yes, that was it. Thank you or jostling my memory. I didn't realize you could get multiple plans for doing it multiple times, but that seems consistent with other dailies (e.g. Biv). I did it at such a low level that a deathclaw there scared me off from doing it again. XD
---
Who's gonna send the .38's to Bethesda and ask to weigh these to prove they don't weigh 0.
---
Please this was to be funny not serious.
---
Of course, because gas masks so rare ingame. Almost 800h and still haven't found one.
---
Nah I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm just play on ps4 for now. I‚Äôm still saving for a bomb pc so maybe one day :)
---
Cool. I‚Äôm thinking 1x chameleon + unyielding ... possibly a single life saving ...
---
The really need to use base classes for recipes. XD
---
&gt;Water =&gt; Purified Water
---
&gt;Water =&gt; Boiled Water
---
Recipes use water.
---
Make critical banker a pistol only perk?
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs my wonder.
---
It's better to look good than to feel good
---
The OP is saying he wants bethesda to create another server that scans all the game servers for all players inventories and then have an app on his phone or such that he can use to view all his characters inventories.
---
Which I had to explain to him with the issues the servers already have with inventories it would cause massive lag on the servers, not to mention bethesda would have to pretty much rewrite a lot of the server code to allow it to communicate with another server that isn't the client to collect all the info of what is in each inventory.
---
She wasn't called the Mister of Mystery. 
---
Besides, a tattered suit with HUGE gold lame' ruffles would look silly! üòÇ
---
Ah no worries, you could def just launch nukes though, or try find a group on discord or something that does nukes
---
I did not know about that second location! Thank you!!!
---
You were being sarcastic, right??
---
I‚Äôm new to Reddit. Do you think you can guide me through so I can learn on how to discover ps4 communities for 76
---
Channel your inner Corporal Maxwell Q. Klinger and go with it!
---
I have 5 for sale in my vendor for others to pick up (Xbox). I'm camped near there and just run down when i join a new server to see if it's there. It's about 50/50 so far.
---
You lose them. The person gets what they want and you get nothing. So pay attention to your caps vs what you have in your machine
---
The never were "gas masks", though... that beak was just stuffed full of perfumed crap and rose petals and shit to mask the smell of decaying bodies.
---
It's just a leather mask... not a hazmat suit.
---
Before switching to being a heavy gunner, I was running explosives constantly, but only Nuka grenades and MIRV frags.  Try those out.  I never found a good use for quantum grenades.
---
I do! I have no choice!
---
Can you pacify first and then get close to tame or do you have to immediately tame?
---
I have 10 charisma, maxed Whisperer and Friend, and spent hours yesterday. Found lots of solo creatures along a popular random encounter route but none of them gave the option to tame.
---
Hey check out that big palace at the top of the map. I found a dead tourist there. Sorry forgot the name of the place.
---
Same thought here. Survival has a lot to offer, but I‚Äôm not interested in being one-shotted at spawn points or while minding my own business. (Before someone jumps on it, not wanting to be involved in PVP is different than crying about it when it happens.)
---
Terrain in the distance turns this sickly green color. It's disgusting.
---
My friends think I‚Äôm crazy as well for playing... so I made in game friends lol
---
You srent shitting on my post, true that sometimes you can sell it for more tha. It's worth but that doesnt negate my suggestion at all.
---
Yes, please!
---
I would love survival mode if that damn psychic map marker went away. It would be a great experience if it wasn't for the leaderboard markers.
---
Their inclusion is one of the worst decisions I have ever seen in the franchise.
---
What are you talking about, nothing can be placed above stairs? I've built multiple level CAMPs many times, with 3 floors.  I've got 53 camps under my belt, I've had many of them multi level structures. You can't build too high, or too low. Place your CAMP device in the middle of where you want your structure to be, and you  can have up to 6 different floors, 3 up 3 down.
---
And I put wires through walls in every single build I've done, and never had power cut off. 
---
You can also put the decon arch on a regular switch, it doesn't have to be a keypad.
---
&gt;If your only doing it to pvp why not go to survival.
---
Because survival is pretty much dead at this point
---
So max range is where damage becomes zero? And if your range was 100, then you deal 50% damage at 50 units distance for example?
---
Maybe a lil bit. Hard to be straight, when reading...this
---
Put your good items under favorite so you don't exidentally sell them.
---
Shit. Thanks for letting me know!
---
Yeah the map markers really ruin the mode
---
There's been dozens of 'how to do the event' posts and videos posted on this sub.
---
It is super annoying. I'm hoping we see some better prices when the summer sales start in a few weeks.
---
I've personally found the MIRV frags less effective than the regulars. Nuke grenades might not be bad, but I dont know if I can make enough to have it be a viable option
---
Well, he din't specifically say how data was to be acquired, and Companion App saved data from client and you could browse it without game running, thus I assumed that is what he meant.
---
Oh goody
---
Honestly im not really sure, i just happened to find my group because one of them had a discord link in their camp. I would try making a post just asking if there are any ps4 groups that do a lot of nukes, or if you see someone in game launch more than one nuke on a server maybe add them and join them, since its fairly likely theyre going to do a lot. Again though i got lucky by just talking to people doing nukes in game and im not on ps4 so not sure.
---
That really suits it, like an old school NASCAR racecar. I downloaded a Nuka Cola Livery for one of my  "classic racer" class cars
---
That means you can fully complete it with one team... you can complete 1 third of it with one team.
---
If ghoul radiation is an issue, work on your rad resist. It‚Äôs why i always chuckle at people saying BoS Combat is the best. Yeah, your DR is a bit higher (it‚Äôs not much higher compared to buttressed Marine), and your ER is a lot higher (but high ER is fairly worthless; there‚Äôs basically no sources of high ER damage in the game; going from 200 ER to 300 ER against a robot shooting a 50 damage laser is only going to change the final Hp Damage by a very small amount.)
---
But Buttressed marine armor gives you like 100 rad resist. That is HUGE compared to 0 on combat armor. 0 to 100 has a MUCH bigger impact than 200 to 300. 
---
Look up the damage formulas. 
---
Buttressed Marine or polished Heavy Robot are the best all-around armors IMO. Trapper goes too heavy on the RR; there just isn‚Äôt enough big damage Rad hits to justify losing that much from DR/ER.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.
---
Point towards enemy.
---
Seriously though, get dense mod for your chest. Reduces explosive and sb attacks.
---
You‚Äôre dead before you notice them. Some will camp the nearest spawn point after they kill you just for fun.
---
hey, whatever floats your boat man. If everyone wanted/needed the same exact resource nodes, the game would kinda turn into a shitshow.
---
Either is the mistery bandana thing, but it counts
---
Thanks! I had thought of doing a Red Rocket one, actually. I may end up doing both though, lol.
---
You can easily get disease just from farming Whitesprings, which spawns high level ghouls, no point in going to low level enemies.
---
Thanks for the advice, I will definitely try to find a nice group to join because I definitely need this set since I‚Äôm a bloodied build and it would support me big time
---
Ive never lost any gear.. but I do wish balance and bugs were a higher priority...
---
Well tell Todd Howard you're going to eat a Jeep unless this is changed.
---
You can only get whoopsies from diseased mirelurk spawn :)
---
Congrats. Wanna cookie?
---
I tested myself a few days ago. Had a guy not on my team blast my lvl 16 bear with a TSE 50 cal... nothing happened.
---
I knew of the bug.  All my good guns are favorited. Didn‚Äôt matter here and I know I didn‚Äôt sell or drop it.
---
Buggy game is still buggy. This should‚Äôve been at the top of a fix it list from the beginning. 
---
In the end, what do we play for except to get gear?  There is no real endgame- that‚Äôs it. 
---
As long as this bug exists, it‚Äôs a random chance every log out to lose everything you‚Äôve worked for, which essentially invalidates possibly hundreds of play hours.
---
It‚Äôs unacceptable. It‚Äôs not fun.  
---
It makes dealing with all the rest of the buggy garbage senseless. Why bother?
---
I really only ‚Äúenjoyed‚Äù playing After getting that and being able to stomp the ws robot rush - 1 hit, groups down.  It made me chuckle every time.  Most of the game gives me a migraine.
---
I could solo card conveys so quick they never got away. I did solo silo runs easily.  
---
The parts of the game that were a slough, a total grind fest, became fun to do- like when you finally got to get scorchbeasts back, but it didn‚Äôt get old after a day.
---
I went to grab it last night when I saw a convoy fly over ws golf club and after realizing it was gone, that smile dropped to nothing but that feeling of being screwed over again. 
---
I feel that enough irl, I don‚Äôt need bad game developers giving it to me during my down time.
---
Whew... ok. Lmao. I was going to gentle suggest trying legoland instead.üëçüòÇ
---
But I don't want to look hilarious lol
---
It's a weapon. Thus it's levelled.
---
Has to be.  Cant remember the last time I saw someone use an assault rifle that wasnt 8ft tall and green.
---
This needs to happen time now. I need my crops inside so that I don't have enemies attacking them.
---
Plus this would be great if we had other content to make a green house.
---
REALLY?!?!  MIRV frags KILLED when I would run them.  Make sure to invest into Grenadier.  It increases the blast radius of your grenades.
---
Yeah went home for lunch and tried both spots thanks to [this guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn0tqj/psa_here_are_some_tips_for_the_cooking_merit_badge/) giving the exact locations. I lucked out and got both.
---
Tick is from Stings and Wings for sure.
---
also make sure to run pulse grenades for robots.
---
I'm on PC too, and I agree there's been significant improvement, but it still seems like nearly every time I try to take a workshop, or run a Silo, or fight the Queen, I'll get dropped. If I'm just fucking around Flatwoods and my CAMP, I'll be fine for 3 hours straight. Anecdotal yes, but that's my experience.
---
It's been happening to my friends and I randomly as well. Sometimes if we leave the server and rejoin it fixes it. It's very random tho :(
---
Yeah, but that's a story item, so it gets a pass. Plus, it belonged to one of the Unstoppables!
---
Also to stop self damage you could go with the perk in endurance. It should reduce explosive damage by 45%. I think it is called fireproof.
---
Yeah, I crash sometimes but not nearly as bad as I used to. I also find myself hopping servers between market sales and nukes. I try not to hit a triple nuke, usually causes a lot of lag if anything else.
---
There should be no limit what so ever. Bethesda needs to remove it.
---
 The PC has been very stable for me lately.
---
They havent sold anything like this in the Atom shop so far...  not sure why everyone is saying that anything nee coming to the game is going to be pay to win.
---
Nice! I got both the first time i went looking. Then I was mostly just checking middle mountain; and yeah, days before i found a third.
---
Because Bethesda Austin literally cannot figure out how to fix it. It worked before but they did something and broke it. Then they gave us a BS excuse as to why they couldn't figure it out. Now 6 months later, we're still wondering why they can't handle this game.
---
Yes just east of Berkeley is a junk node under a power pylon and a small pond is also in the radius. If you place your camp just right you can get both.
---
Naw, I'm pretty sure he wants it on his phone, I assume, as he says "I'd like to be able to look at my inventory during my lunch break." So I assume he means an app that isn't tied to the client in anyway.
---
Been playing for 2 hrs now... No instant kill yet.
---
And the server seems full. Im hovering around 4 or 5 but not marked yet. I ran in to a triple diget... I scooted away but he caught up and waved. I waved back and he gave me couple stims and went on towards the other high lvls that were battling in Charleston.
---
Everyone blows this way out of proportion. It's fun
---
It‚Äôs based off it, but I‚Äôve tweaked a few things to accommodate my play-style. I have both non-automatic and automatic rifles, so I constantly switch between commando and rifleman. I also change my endurance perk depending on whether I‚Äôm in PvE or PvP. For PvP I use Fireproof and for PvE I switch to Rejuvenated.
---
Edit: I forgot to add, having ultra-light armour gives you extra AP that you can use in VATS.
---
I dislike PVP too, but disabling it all together is a little extreme. I‚Äôve yet to have a problem taking a workshop.
---
Granted I tried them when I was much lower level, so maybe with the perk set up I have now they might be better. I think radius was the issue since they tended to scatter away from my intended target
---
The plumber build can be fun. They have so many weapon mods you can choose from and actually think the rifle and pistol works for the revolver if you upgrade it with a rifle barrel. Can‚Äôt confirm personally but seen people taking about it
---
I know, just trying to make it even easier.
---
It also makes sense if the perk stops radaway from curing your mutation it should avoid suppression.
---
Time to spend em!!
---
It was a bit of a joke, but at the same time .....
---
Have you played recently? Teleporting to Arktos is still a healthy 30% chance of an app freeze. Servers still die unexpectedly, stutter, etc and I generally play with friends so it can't be 3 people's internet connections simultaneously dropping _and not the servers still_.
---
I'm glad you enjoy the game enough to suggest that someone else can't be right. I enjoy it, too. But your insult is very naive.
---
System?
---
Haha, yes, a lil more gentle, like a ocean breathe in late summer.
---
Not sure I believe that you protected 3 habitats with 2 people.
---
we JUST had this convo earlier this morning 
---
If you want to keep your junk...stash it before a large event and/or going to an area with a ton of players.  We can't differentiate between dropped items, or dead paper bags...nor do we want to.  There has to be consequences for dying.
---
That's exactly what companion app is: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bethsoft.falloutcompanionapp&amp;hl=en
---
I miss FO4s survival mode..
---
Yeah same here. Not too painful an experience thankfully
---
i agree,  it should put a bounty on someone.  i hate seeing "another player has looted your bag"
---
I have it at rank 2, it helps, but I still get myself far too often
---
Just to make someone angry.
---
Radshield has higher rad resist, that's already a trade off.
---
Just stash your loot. It's not a crime to loot a dead person.
---
I don't think it would be that overpowered, maybe just let us apply it as a skin for the gas mask
---
Newest patch introduced a glitch where if foundations is too low or high items are locked when placed and can't be removed unless you move your camp.
---
Also introduced a new glitch where you cant place anything above stairs.
---
It's new.
---
Have you built an entire camp since they changed foundations to allow floating buildings? That's when it happened.
---
Search the forums.
---
Also, glitches don't happen to everyone. Count yourself lucky. I'm giving tils to help avoid these current glitches. (And a form of briefing).
---
Shower - read my post again. If on normal switch people are trolling by leaving it on and in some cases you have to go thru it to get into the base. Keypad prevents this.
---
Read the forums to confirm any of this.
---
In the future, maybe do some research before saying someone doesn't know what they are talking about and make sure you do.
---
I saw some stuff about it. But I never got confirmation on if pope weapon benefit from rifle and pistol damage increase perks. But it‚Äôs a cool one.
---
Sometimes. Every time I have seen this bug it has never actually stopped something from being accessible. I have had to completely redo my camp before to get rid of it.
---
The point is that it is the only consequence of dying in the game right now. If you don't even risk losing your junk then death in this game is basically a free stimpack with possible travel benefits.
---
Knowing them they'd totally introduce an infuriating bug if they added it to your camp and then never fix that bug.
---
I say it somewhat in jest. I really don't care even if they do. I only use ultracite .50 cal and 5mm, and both of those I am able to farm in enough abundance that I never have need for anything else, and I sell all my shotgun shells and 5.56 at 1-2c each.
---
The whole repair kit thing? Has been nothing but a positive for me. I'm sitting on 80+ improved repair kits and haven't needed to use my own materials to repair stuff in ages. Unfortunatley it did devalue the gears / springs that I had stocked up.
---
That would technically be pay to win
---
do me a favor and put on grenadier (I only ran level 1) and carpet bomb with your mirvs.
---
Sorry didn't read through the whole comment but why would you even get such a useless mutation.
---
Stop being a wimp about your little bag of screws and plastic. If you don‚Äôt want to loose junk on death, stash it, or don‚Äôt die. You want to remove the one minor bit of tension death brings to the game.
---
What did you use as your chef outfit?  I have the hat and a rolling pin of strength, but no outfit.
---
No thanks, we don't need more inflated prices.
---
Both are now uploaded onto the Forza Horizon 4 design catalog. Searching "vault 76" "tricentennial" or "Retro Flutter" should bring them up.
---
Those exceptions are valid imo. Those items actually have crafting use. Bulked scrap has zero use besides selling or scrapping for material, which is exactly the same as any other junk such as desk fans and typewriters.
---
It's not a mutation - it's a disease you get from the mirelurk spawn that you need for one of the atom challenges. and if you are referring to electrically charged then it's great for killing things dumb enough to melee me :D
---
I have a set of stairs where my old house was at my camp that I cannot get rid of. Says there is something that will be floating if I scrap it but there's nothing else around it. Fucking annoying.
---
They are now uploaded. :D
---
LOL. You get killed by your own stuff? I am largely immune to explosions. Its 3 Fireproof and a Dense Chest to avoid almost all explosive damage. I thought that was essential for an explosive build.
---
 I run a Bloodied Auto Grenade Launcher. I don't have a Bloodied build but I can get worn down on occasion, and its just fun. Blew the Sheepsquatch away the other day in about 15 hits. So a bit more than one mag. ;)
---
Yeah, Mirv frags seemed to have a smaller blast radius, same as nuka quantum grenades. Most enemies side stepped away and I got in 0 dmg.
---
I mean the thing you suppressed :)
---
I'm getting +120 carry weight... with that kind of bonus they can strap a fucking scorchedbeast shit to my back.
---
It is done. :D
---
You‚Äôre not wrong, but neither is he. All Rise IS better than both weapons OP posted.
---
yeah then it does damage to melee attackers which is useful in normal play
---
Wtf
---
Yeah the amount of shit you drop is absurd currently. I tend to horde and have Through hiker, I die in Survival and drop like 200 aid items...
---
I figured on death it be like 2-3 Stimpacks, maybe a couple Purified Water or something, nah shit is like....
---
Die = I drop like 97 Cans of Dog Food, 75 Purified Water, 18 Stimpacks, 20 Canned Coffee, ect, ect, ect ,ect
---
That is for fallout 4, a single player game, not a online multiplayer game like this. With how poorly the servers handle inventories the last thing we need is to stress the servers more with API calls for what is in the players inventories from the server.
---
It gives a "crafting item unlocked" message in the top left corner when you get it at the same time as the rewards pop up so you may not have noticed it?
---
Let's not forget that the Vaccinated perk appears to be utterly useless in preventing diseases.... you've contracted BoNe WoRmS. In your PA. With 3* vaccinated.
---
Oh. Do it kinda fun tho or no?
---
You‚Äôre not doing anything wrong, enemies outside the forest take several explosive hits. It‚Äôs not that big a deal, I run explosives a lot and you find tons more than you‚Äôll ever really use.
---
The black backpack almost perfectly matches the Hunter's Long Coat and the Standard Backpack that's green goes well with the normal Leather Coat (not traveling)
---
And yet in all that time, you haven't run into this incredibly common problem? 
---
Your egotistical, insulting reply was offensive, and it showed ignorance of a _basic_ problem known about by a broad swath of the player base, that has been touched on here in this subreddit _many, many times_. Your egotistical, insulting comment showed your _ignorance_ which is, generally, based on _inexperience_. 
---
It's fucking hilarious that you're getting mad at me for saying you were probably a new player, based on your _lack of experience with the game_ when you're just...willfully ignorant. 
---
The issues aren't caused by my playstyle. My playstyle is fine, the issue is with _incompetent coding_. If you can build for a specific playstyle with non-bugged game mechanics, you shouldn't be _punished_ for it by _bad game design_  when you die. 
---
You egotistical ignorant troll.
---
Thanks. :D It was the most deserving vehicle for it.
---
All I had was flamer, shishkebeb, rolling up, chef hat, Molotov‚Äôs, and any of the lab, or science outfits.
---
I run an automatic L50 The Fixer. The damage boost on the Fixer is nice, as is the sneaking movement speed bonus, and I can put a recon scope on it for scouting.!
---
I agree, but they are an exception to the ‚Äòall scrap gets scrapped‚Äô idea. Adding a ‚Äòdo you want to scrap bulk?‚Äô Option would really cover all bases as there are already exceptions within junk, why not have that as an option?
---
That is precisely why I said that it have no need to contact server to collect data, it can get it all from client while game is played and only then.
---
Indeed! Whitewalls are amazing on old school rides.
---
It‚Äôs not just precious loot it‚Äôs their precious camps too. I mean, I am really impressed how some players have built their camps.  But it‚Äôs Fallout 76 not SIMS.  I think that‚Äôs a reason why people don‚Äôt play survival because their camps now become fair game.  
---
It‚Äôs almost like they need an architecture mode!
---
Agreed. They've seriously assaulted solo players in every possible way with this game. They said we could play it alone but we're at a big disadvantage.
---
It's not as broken as it was a month ago, I only drop 2-3 at a time.
---
is game. why you heff to be mad?
---
You can one shot everything with melee and you keep your distance with guns, I don't see why you need it.
---
you have to have the right perk cards and lower your health below 20% as well as having the right mutations.
---
Please support all the industry standard accomodations that have been asked for since release. Not having support for the deaf or colour blind is absolutely ridiculous when indy games accomplish such feats on a regular basis.
---
Yeah, the add another set of stairs doesn't always work, but it is worth a shot in the small chance it will work. Basically he needs to add something to "support" the floating floors, be it another set of stairs or a wall and stairs to be able to remove the floors.
---
Unfortunately CAMP building is extremely buggy with "floating" items even if they aren't floating sometimes the game still thinks they are, or that they are intersecting with another item even though there are none around.
---
That‚Äôs a good idea. Only problem would be if they were like me and were always almost over encumbered. That 5 pound hazmat suit adds up
---
And...dude..I've been using this "niche meta build" for more than 700 hours of play time. The fact that so many other people are doing the same shit as me is telling.
---
Cause at Bethesda Austin, none of them have common sense or any level of creativity.
---
*has enough caps to purchase 1 serum recipe before purchasing. Sudden sale at own vending machine and loses excess caps for a high priced item before acquiring serum recipe.* üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±
---
Edinburgh actually.
---
It was 1 skin a week for a month. Due to their special nature, there‚Äôs a good chance they will not be coming back, but no one knows for sure.
---
Never said I needed it but I like it and I'm not going to russian roulette radaway to get rid of mutations until it's gone and then have to redo all of them when instead i could just pop a rad-x for 5 minutes :D
---
There are no good, and there are no bad.
---
There is only RNG with a huge list to pick through. 
---
People often don't realize the random distributions are can quite often be pretty damn lumpy.
---
They are fixing bugs. We dont know why they fix some before they fix others, but to say they aren't fixing any bugs at all is a blatant lie.
---
Survival could just cut mutations benefits in half, can't be that hard to do. If they cut them in adventure mode I'd be pissed, they're fun as hell to use but I absolutely see them being dumb in pvp.
---
Not if he wants it to update daily, and do it on his phone regardless of if he is playing or not. Read the conversation I had with OP above, what he is asking for would require a whole rewrite of the server software to communicate with some random phone APP.
---
Where will this be posted?
---
so are our CAMPS still immune in survival? that is the only reason i havent tried it yet, i just know my house will get demolished if people can
---
Um I paid 60 dollars and the thing barely ran and was a technical disaster. This has nothing to do with needing a chill pill. I replied to a comment saying it was all just a bunch of people that didn‚Äôt know what they were talking about that were putting the game and studio down. That‚Äôs factually incorrect.
---
It‚Äôs been improved in that there‚Äôs a delay in spawning in so it‚Äôs not like instant killing.  Now, you spawn into WS or the train station and you will attract some attention.
---
The backpacks look alright with some outfits - like the Hunter's Long Coat + Black backpack w/ Shovel looks nice and the standard green backpack looks good with the normal leather coat but I would like the option to hide them as well because right now I am running the Engineer's outfit + helmet and the plague doctor and while the backpack is hidden by the tiny thing on the back of the science scriber's outfit - the engineer's gas/oxygen tank does not hide the backpack which makes no sense lol
---
I think everyone agrees on that, hopefully they remove them soon. Legendaries should be removed too imo.
---
They‚Äôre supposed to explode in a shower of tiny grenades but they don‚Äôt anymore.
---
I have neither of those things just yet! Appreciate the tip though
---
Chocolate chip? That would be nice thank you...
---
Take a breath, go into adventure mode and gear up.
---
How many were you carrying?
---
I wish bugs and balance were higher priorities...
---
I hope you find what you're looking for friend. Try questing up near Grafton for a bit.
---
Redo it? There are serums lol
---
You are right. Suggestion B would indeed imply that dieing has no real consequences.
---
What do you think about suggestion A? It adds the extra difficulty for the player that loots the bag wether it is worth taking the risk to collect the bag.
---
I dont really have an issue with losing the stuff. Its the feeling that the other guy got it for free and I want to pvp him for it.
---
That‚Äôs gotta be it. Guess I just didn‚Äôt see it unlock. At least I‚Äôm not the only one!
---
Yeah - that cost materials or I could just use rad x.... for free
---
Lol no. Brewing was supposed to be ready for launch yet wasn‚Äôt. Backpacks is a creation pack mod from fo4 that was brought forward.
---
Nothing is more attractive than a pink asylum outfit on a man. üòª
---
Well the improved repair kit I get from SBQ events really came in handy when I was doing project paradise and my weapon broke mid event so I have no problem with them and you got my upvote
---
My mileage varies. I like to go straight for the headshot, every time. Or legs.
---
I just wish I could find a recipe for the normal wood ones!
---
Agreed - this guy has been confusing either himself or other people
---
They can only destroy it if you engage with another player when you are at your camp.
---
You don't need materials just some caps, in PC there is even a guy doing it for free lol
---
Wrong, even steel saves weight by bulking. If you bulk steel it goes from total weighing 1.6 lbs, to 1.5lbs, so each bulk of steel saves you a .1 lbs, that adds up when you have over 1k steel.
---
Totally agree with this.
---
I have several from the SBQ and use them for those moments late in a gaming session where I just want to finish a quest/event now because I'm about to stop playing.
---
or or get this.. ican just use rad x instead of wasting time/materials/caps :D weird
---
death should have consequences..
---
You should receive them once you‚Äôve taken a workshop and defended it once. They will be under the defense tab in you building menu
---
So explosives in this game was seriously underpowered at launch. Then it got a 40% damage Nerf when the TSEs got nerfed. They reduced demo expert from 100% dmg to 60% dmg. So now they are even more under powered. 
---
I'm not talking about paper damage. I'm referring to the weight to damage ratio you see in other weapons and firearms. Although explosives does area damage and makes quick work of smaller mobs, especially good for clearing those pests on Free Range, they do next to no damage on heavier enemies. 
---
The missile launcher damage window is important to consider. I've had several bouts with some flying scorchbeasts which sometimes they take tons of damage other times next to none. This is determined by which way the creature is moving. If they are moving towards the center of the explosion damage window they take more damage, but if they are strafing to the side, they take significantly less damage. I don't know the effects of other explosives, but I'd imagine they are similar, if not the same. 
---
When using explosives like grenades, missiles, Fatman, or even explosive legendary effects on other weapons, there is an import rule to consider: #Apply Liberally.
---
Or get this you are too lazy to get rid of something you don't need :D
---
TIL: They have weight to them.
---
I agree completely that it is irritating. I still don't want a higher caps maximum because of the negative effects it will have on an in-game economy.
---
How do you like the TSE Gatling laser?
---
Stupid question, how much weight are you carrying?
---
Nope, lead, aluminum, oil, and steel all get lighter by bulking vs the mats to bulk them.
---
or i could spend my caps on things i do want/like and use my materials to make things for other people :D how is that lazy to use an item as intended?
---
Are you being serious? There‚Äôs gas masks everywhere.
---
From your personal terminal, yes.  You can currently launch three dailies, Biv and the two Scout quests.
---
It typically crashes for me after I remark what a great server it is. Every other enemy is legendary, some 3 star, and it crashes before I can loot them all.
---
You must not carry much, my experience dropping all that stuff was from playing less than 2 weeks ago.
---
What bothers me the most is being able to drink and eat under water in power armor. There clearly isn't enough room inside to do so, unless it's jammed into the headpiece before I put it on.
---
Mmmm üòçüòú
---
Conduit, and it is under advanced power connectors
---
Placeable planters don't seem like a difficult thing to implement. They have non-placeable variants already in the game and Fallout 4 had a placeable planter.
---
Bloodied stealth VATS sniper build. 1 str, 15 per, 1 end, 4 cha, 5 int, 15 agi, 15 luck. With unyielding and herd mentality+strange adding.. i want to say 18 to each stat (15 unyielding, 2 herd, +1 SiN), plus a few points here and there from armor (34 is the magic number for luck and VATS)
---
I can‚Äôt equip many str/end perks, but I don‚Äôt really need to. Between 18 str, and a high-cap backpack I can swap in (normal combat is an armored backpack) my carry weight is pretty good. Endurance perks are minor QoL items as far as i care. Not essential. I have enough Charisma for a 3star flex card and SiN. I have just enough Int for any 5star card, but usually it‚Äôs 2/5 Weaponsmith and 3/3 Nerd Rage. 
---
So really, most of the time I have 18+ in EVERY stat except Endurance. And as a stealth player, endurance... eh.
---
Your very much in the wrong mode switch too adventure survival is where people go for more pvp
---
Bugged.
---
It's understandable and I don't want it happen either.
---
Seen it at most vendors. Always see it at watoga.
---
Yes it was instigating with faster reload and bash damage, a perfect roll for a crossbow. I was quite disappointed.
---
 The only thing that upsets me now is the delayed damage bug. 
---
 I run the Golf Course with my Combat Knives and I can take almost no damage if I am careful. Now with that bug running, its much more dangerous for me.
---
You can use discord on your phone as a temporary solution.
---
Yeah, this "I used to have a moral objection to pay to win mechanics, but they're so HANDY" bullshit does indeed get my downvote.   
---
Ironically, this comment will  also get downvotes.
---
best place is the area below white springs with the soldier statue on the map above uncanny caverns. on the steps
---
How does that help deaf players? All that is doing is moving the voice chat to a third party app. Not to mention very few people use discord while playing the game.
---
Exactly.  Sometimes I just track other players to learn their habits or commonly travelled spots or paths.  You can also observe how other weapons act and or tactics that people use.
---
Heh....you know, I have pretty significant red/green cone deficiency (whatever it is technically called), and have never given it much thought what all I might be actually missing in the gaming experience in general.  Hmmm.
---
Straight jacket. That's what I use for my raider chef "Dr. Sizzler"
---
I would actually pay money subscribe to a devstream with Q&amp;A access.
---
When you get to caps limit all the time like most players do, buying some serum don't even make you feel like costing anything. Maybe you should work on getting some caps then.
---
I'd like to see an alternative to the price set slider. I'd rather punch in the number on a keypad or even use the PS4 keyboard. The slider is annoying asf.
---
rule #1.. never bulk unless you are going Directly to the vendor to sell...
---
Also why isn't the vaccinated perk working?
---
That default backpack is super hideous, yeah, probably so you shell out some atoms. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to wear it for a while until I bought the shovel one, which looks ok I guess.
---
Yeah I noticed that last night. I switched and things have been better just still can't seem to get past dying every hour.
---
 You died. You have nothing to say about it. ;)
---
You get my vote for "Mister of Mystery"...
---
though "Myster of Mistery" would look better on paper.
---
No. Never was.
---
Gotta get people to buy those emotes somehow /s
---
Had that panic yesterday. Got an onscreen notice that I earned 1800+ for selling shotgun shells.
---
I had only listed 400. And they were set to 0 caps. I panicked because I use shotgun ammo as a backup and worried I accidentally listed ALL of it instead of just the crazy overage amount I had.
---
Looks like someone with 1800 shotgun ammo "bought" the 400 I had listed, lol.
---
All my unlisted ammo was still in my stash and I gained no caps from the sale.
---
I have max caps on 3 alts right now lol I have caps and I can afford serums all day - I'd just rather buy items / armor / weapons for my friends and I than waste them when I can get what I want for free? You seem really dense \^ \^ good luck bud.
---
So I had a good learning curve for this as well, but once I got used to it, I prefer this way now. I still sometimes forget which way to go if it comes off the head target, then end up cycling all crazy lol
---
Can you add more than 1 mod on a backpack? I have high cap only. I have the marine wet suit and the shovel backpack with an assaultron helmet.
---
Ha! Try playing when they release modded servers. Then the modders will fix all of the bugs, and nobody will play regular servers anymore. Just like in fallout 4. The modders will fix 99% of their glitches with mods. That's what happened in Fallout 4.
---
I guess it's one reason I like the game and why I can look past the lack of engaging NPC : when you get around level 40 most places are no longer a death treat and the game turns into a walking simulator.
---
Some people mgiht see this as an insult, but the point of most walking simulator is to offer a story that is usually delivered via letters or recordings... like Fallout 76 does; you also follow that trail of clues until you fidn the final fate of the people you followed, like Fallout 76.
---
Now of course different people have different objectives, but just exploring and reading all the stories of those people who dissapeared, either during the Great War and the chaos that ensued, or later, victim of the plague, is something I enjoy.
---
I have learned to live off what I find in the field. I'm not great at PvP but Adventure is so boring. 
---
The first time I lost all my precious aid I was devastated. But I've learned to live lean. Adds some sport to the game.
---
Like I'll get parasites and I've run out if my last can of dog food. Time to get to whitespringns and Sprint or sneak my way to the fountain. Sprinting works well as long as your weapon is away nobody can VATs you. Then I get my cure and try and get out.
---
There is already far more solo content in the game than group content.
---
This is a multiplayer game, it should focus on bringing players together. 
---
Learning to work with other players is a benefit of online gaming.
---
Discord does text chat too. In fact that's the only way I use it.
---
Nope. Live with it.
---
I'm still waiting for Beth to make all the hairstyles open for male and female characters.
---
Thag the Destroyer wishes to slay Super Muties while wearing a sparkly red dress and pigtails, please.
---
Just did SBQ for the first time, didn't join a team or initiate it just showed up. We killed it but then someone followed me around and griefed me until I left the server, reminding me why I don't do stuff like that.
---
Then maybe you should rethink your priorities lol.
---
That sounds exactly average.
---
There is an issue that will make the game stutter if you have a particular long friends list. Apart from that i have no idea what it might be
---
Ok, haven't experienced this glitch, but I'll take your word for it. 
---
Yeah, a regular switch can solve that problem, though. Just place it so you can access if from either side of the arch. I'm running like 10% health and get annoyed when people just have it hardwired, but with any kind of switch you can still turn it off, it does not have to be a keypad. I have mine on a switch, people use it and leave it on all the time, I just turn it back off.
---
If I'm claiming one of those useless workshops, it's just for a challenge. In which case I'll just server hop to find one that's unowned.
---
That makes 0 sense but like I said - good luck dude :D
---
Atta boy!  See...not hard to come up with a perfectly reasonable explanation 100% on board!
---
Are you playing in the forest region still? Because you should still be in the forest region. Don't follow the main quest, it's \_laughably\_ badly implemented.
---
Here's what you do. Stick to the forest, explore that coastline, grind up a few levels. When "leader of the pack" pops up, at Tyler County Fair Grounds do that, because it can grant you some legendary loot suitable for your level, pretty quickly. 3 wolves with (usually) 1 star gear. When you're level 30-35, continue with the main quest.  
---
And if you're actually trying to play in survival mode...don't. It's even more badly implemented than the main questline.
---
80, wow!  I must not go on enough SBQ runs.  I have about seven of them.
---
My opinion hasn't changed - they're fine.  I don't care if someone else buys them or earns them.  I see the argument as far as *"This might lead to truly problematic paid content down the road"* but I'll save my outrage for if and when that happens.
---
I've had 1 issue ever with greifing actually around launch. Everything else has been people being friendly, generous or nice. I just don't like talking.
---
Speaking of deaf...  (as in tone)
---
Yea whatever good day to you lol
---
Fair point haha
---
I guess you failed your reading comprehension classes in school huh?
---
Improved repair kits are only from in game events like Scorchbeast queen. Those are all I use. I haven't spent a dime on the Atomic shop, nor have I spent any atoms on repair kits ever.
---
$$$
---
Your still learning to play so things will take time if enemies are too high lvld in an area you need to be in server hop. Enemies spawn based on thenlvl of the player entering so if a high lvl player enters enemies of high lvl will spawn. My other recommendation is that you should plan and focus on a specific build as a good build can make the difference between this game being super difficult or easy mode.
---
Think I had to hop 40/50 times to get it to spawn for me. Keep it up, they'll show eventually!
---
(Although you may want to check the map/nearby players every so often to make sure your actually switching, ever so often you get stuck rejoining and may need to wait a bit before reconnecting)
---
Yes, but Fallout 4 wasn't running a simulation for 20+ people at once. We've already seen how hard personal *vendors* are on the server. Planters could have issues as well.
---
And, y'know, -2 PER penalty
---
In fact, this would be like a Pay-to-*Lose* since you're getting a penalty instead of a buff
---
I know but will they fix all the shit people keep complaining about or just continue to release new bug patches that don't seem to appease us all that much? In other words are they hearing us or just doing what they think needs fixing?
---
Oh nice i thought theyd mess with mutations. Thanks!
---
How are you going to communicate with strangers in one off encounters? Are they supposed to use voice chat to tell strangers to join their discord for a minute?
---
No insult, genuine question. What platform are you on? I get the impression PC stability is much better than others. I run two clients and while I average a client crash or two a session, I play for hours at a time usually 4 times a week, and I know they‚Äôre client crashes because the second client stays in. And I blame that on me abusing the game; running 2 clients simultaneously along with 20+ tabs in a web browser and tabbing between them all regularly is not going to be good for stability. 
---
I‚Äôve joined Arkatos 3 or 4 times now, never had performance issues with it. Well, performance from teammates, sure. And they definitely fucked the spawn rates for resources to improve the friendly spawns, but that‚Äôs not a performance issue, it‚Äôs a design one. 
---
Although, I *joined* Arkatos. I‚Äôve never taken the elevator in.
---
Yeah, and if the only repair kits in the game came from boss fights, I'd be agreeing with you. It's "and if someone is bad enough at the game that they have to spend IRL money on atoms to buy repair kits...that doesn't bother me" that I'm objecting to here, dude.
---
Look, I dont mean you would be winning everything and I personally wouldn't care but you know that the trolls would be coming out if the woodworks saying "Atom shop is cosmetic only!" and "This is a sign of things to come!"
---
If the promised ammunition converter runs on atoms... or we get a fridge that has to be purchased in the shop... yeah that will make me quite upset.
---
Recently I've made a point of spending some time in a play session walking a route.  Mainly I'm looking for the Mothman for a wing, but you trigger so many random events it gives the world a different feel than fast travling from Event to Event.  I also seem to have better lucky in stumbling across legendary creatures this way also.
---
I just heard about that but i assume that is not the problem for me as I have only one friend in my friends list.
---
I do'nt see alot of players, but I bet most of them haven't seen me, male player, walking around dressed as the Mistress of Mysteries, complete with the big-ass ruby and the Veil of Secret.
---
And a Mining helmet with lamp because, better light. I wish there was a Carmen SanDiego-like hat to go with tht costume, but heh.
---
Still requiring a whole different program just to communicate with people and most people don't use discord, not to mention. How would you even contact people in the game with discord unless they just happen to also be on the same discord server you are on? Since there is no way to send a text message to the other player you are playing with in game to say "hey join this discord".
---
Not to mention, it still doesn't help the issue of color blind players basically being unable to read the pipboy UI.
---
Here is what I know for a fact: bulking everything makes more room in my stash, end of story. I'm guessing it's the plastic that gets used to bulk: some of it goes bye bye when you bulk.
---
It's a bethesda game. It will \_always\_ have more unfixed bugs than fixed ones. No bethesda game has \_ever\_ been a even remotely bug free experience.
---
True I overreacted, it is frustrating tho like I wish Bethesda would at least be like "yes we will fix disappearing bodies, perk issues, weapons/damage issues, and whatever else is broken that players want fixed we just need time." Why can't they just tweet that?
---
The RNG gods have not blessed you this day
---
Cool beans. I did the same deal and so glad I did, too!
---
Yeah legendaries just break pvp. I actually just hate the way legendaries were included in the game at all, totally makes crafting worthless.
---
 They are a bad idea. I don't care about pay to win 'cause it ain't. 
---
 Be prepared.
---
 I spawn at my CAMP. I sleep for XP bonus and play the piano for that buff. I wander over to my workshop and look at my Weapons. Any that are at all low get repaired to 200%. I look at my Armour and do the same. Then I fire up the Tinker's Bench after checking my ammo and make what I need.
---
 Then I go out to play.
---
When you get a 3 star assaultron head or wood armor piece, scrap for 40 scrip immediately or else it becomes 1* worth like 5 scrip.
---
Yes please, some of us missed it and want to give you money
---
Survival server is just for PvP, if you're trying to do main quest stuff on there it's going to really suck. Use Adventure mode, at least until you really get the hang of the game.
---
I recommend the keypad but placing the normal switch where it's accessible from both sides works too. The bases ibe been too all have them inside but the shower right at the door so can't go in die to me running unyielding and needing my high rads.
---
That one was more of a QoL tip for visitors.
---
Ok see this makes sense. I was told to do the main quest to help level me up. But it doesn't help losing all my ammo and stimpaks in the process. Ok ok thank you. I'm over here exploring the mountains hanging out way North and South.
---
The station or bos vendor?  
---
Edit: Blessed bro thanks so much I found it at the station in watoga.
---
I had a lvl 4 guy kill me in survival mode.  I went back to trade and the guy had sent/cav armor and like 3 or 4 of the best legendaries (bloodied build).  Granted, it may have been duped or muled but it didn‚Äôt matter and lvl in survival can be misleading. 
---
I have seen an uptick in griefing in adventure mode because the cap benefits are actually better and there are simply more targets in adventure mode.  Not that I do it but I see a lot of others that try to instigate.
---
No the sloth could not be pacified at all.
---
If it gave someone actual power in the game... i might object too. I do object to BGS breaking their promise of cosmetic items only. Maybe other people actually do struggle to keep gear repaired, but I repair mystuff like... once a week. Power armor only needs repaired like once a month. I just wish I could trade my Improved Repair kits because it feels bad throwing them away.
---
I think this has been a problem since launch.
---
Sadly, this will get review bombed, because the sheer number of soulless thieves who like being able to steal your shit without any consequences is depressingly high on this subreddit.  
---
People will go "We need consequences for death" and no one's actually arguing against that... they like being able to steal your shit when the lagspike hits at the end of a queen fight without consequences.   
---
The reality is, this game is such a unstable, buggy mess that there's a very real risk of loosing your loot on death without some soulless shitbag walking over your loot and going "oh, six hundred caps worth of flux, nice". Without the possibility of shooting that soulless dickbag in the face and taking your flux back.   
---
There should be consequences for \_stealing peoples shit\_ as well as death.
---
That's the combo I'm rocking.
---
It can be a tedious. At level 15 I was running circuits around Charleston just for lead, steel, ammo and gunpowder from super mutants, and those precious, precious, screws. Not having Ammosmith nor Excavator armor was making me a bit depressed. You get through it, especially if you give yourself breaks from it to just run around and explore.
---
I did have a client crash when I was about to launch a nuke last week... but I don‚Äôt do that often, I didn‚Äôt expect that to be the norm. I‚Äôll be on guard for that. Haven‚Äôt had issues with a queen fight or a workshop in aaaages. 
---
But that‚Äôs why I tried to clarify ‚Äúin my experience‚Äù, I know mine isn‚Äôt universal.
---
I'd buy 2 more just to see if I could actually pull off running the game x4 on my PC lol. Full solo party with a ton of extra perks!
---
Why so passive agressive? I only stated my thoughts. That doesnt mean I agree with what you say. As stated above, It would bring more tension if taking the actual bag has consequences aswell.
---
so the fact that they are available for IRL money is completely irrelevant to your post, then? why even include that in the subject line if you haven't purchased them?
---
Nice camp!
---
oh great! i think ill try it out tonight then
---
thanks for the reply
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9vkwc2/fallout76_zone_map_with_level_ranges/
---
Make this thing your friend üòâ Along with what others suggested about adventure mode. üôÇ
---
It‚Äôs always like that for me during low level. Can‚Äôt have enough materials to build (loot everything, scrap, repeat), not enough stimpack (diluted is better low level), gears keep breaking (do not repair, wear/use what you find), always over weight (cook radstag, drink whiskey etc. for buffs).. that helped me a lot until I was high enough level where it‚Äôs not too much of a headache. Now I worry more on my Stash limit cuz I have way too much of everything! üòÇ
---
I get that and taking workshops isn‚Äôt my thing but I don‚Äôt mind a PvP episode every once in a while in adventure mode.  It keeps things interesting as long as they aren‚Äôt jerks about it. Sometimes people just want to go or fight.
---
And ya, I'm not.movomg.my.base until these are fixed.
---
Moved my sons and had to do what's stayed above just to get a 2 level base built.
---
Worked around it and now have him a 4 level base hanging off the side of a cliff.
---
The glitches forced us to build differently, lol.
---
Just checked it out and you‚Äôre right, what I was seeing was dark parts on my outfit
---
A bathroom stall...
---
Close to 100. But let's make sure were on the same page, I'm not complaining about getting killed. Fine I got killed. I knew going into survival and doing the challenges that it could happen. But I thought Bethesda fixed it so the player didnt drop an excessive amount of aid? 
---
I also didnt think about leaving it behind in my stash before hand either.
---
I feel ya. I was new to Fallout and this was my introduction. I had the same thing happen where Rose sent me into the mine and it took me 2 hours of taken my pot shots at mile miners that were too strong for me and running away. I finally started to realize I was in wrong part of the world for how weak I was. It‚Äôs been mentioned before but the main quests don‚Äôt scale well with player level of you set out to do them right away. I‚Äôd just stick to events around the forest until you get stronger, or find a higher level buddy to explore higher lever areas. They can do damage control if you get overwhelmed.
---
 Third person problems. I have no sympathy at all. ;)
---
&gt;I never had issues keeping my gear repaired before repair kits.
---
You don't use launchers then I'd bet. I was really looking forward to the idea of repair kits since launchers break after 10-45 shots. If RK's had been craftable it would have made the class of weapons usable. Instead they'll stay a heavy situational novelty.
---
Is there an update to this?  I saw someone rocking olive drab on X-01
---
Pretty sure. Though it is hard to test on console because you can't really tell distance.  It is probably effective range of how far it will do max damage before it starts to taper off.
---
Wait, the dress gives +1 PER?  You mean to tell me I've been wearing a woman's swim suit and a clown hat for nothing?
---
PvP in Adventure has literally become the domain of griefing/team-baiting assholes.
---
And it's getting worse. Within 5 minutes of log-in last night, I got three team requests and 2 party requests. All high level characters, nowhere near me on map.
---
Congrats, dudes. You've managed to make players leery of MP mechanics in what SHOULD be a fun MP game.
---
*slow clap*
---
I said it was a temporary solution, it has a text  that feature which is really easy to use and you dont need to create an account you can use it as a guest. Maybe you can create your own server for hearing impaired players. Many PC players have discord or are familiar with it, not sure how you would ask random players. I was thinking more along the lines of your group of players. Xbox has internal messaging so it's easy to invite players to discord or to send chat between each other.
---
Nor the day before üòì
---
To be honest it was more advertised as a Multiplayer game that you could also enjoy solo. 
---
The solo aspect was clearly not the focus, nor did they imply it would get equal treatment.
---
The only time I remember that I have them is when I go to repair an item on the work bench.
---
Also, it's best to stick to the Forest until you're a bit higher level. Explore the region, do events. 
---
You're scrapping and stashing all your junk, right? Always make sure to do that fairly often. Go on a junk run, scrap it down, stash it. Then if you die it doesn't matter. There is literally no reason to not just let yourself die, unless you're hoarding junk. There's no repercussions to death besides loss of junk in Adventure mode.
---
 A lot of those are network problems. The damage bug is one that affects me.
---
It‚Äôs just junk. Literally. Just. Garbage.
---
They‚Äôve already babied you and made sure you don‚Äôt drop your weapons, armor, ammo, caps, Holos and quest items. 
---
They‚Äôve already put stash boxes at EVERY train station and Red Rocket. Plus most CAMPS have them and they‚Äôve marked those too now with vendors.
---
And - that‚Äôs not enough for you? 
---
FFS... ok üëçüèª
---
Would either summon minutemen to come help you fight or you could call in an airstrike if close enough to a settlement with artillery.
---
Yeah a couple were false switches!
---
That entire red rocket base was perfection.
---
Yes. They are visible
---
Could be. But ingame these people are a rarity. Thats why I thought my post would have a bit more discussion. But as someone mentioned before this has been discussed multiple times apparently. Cheers.
---
Edit on your edit (or i missed half of your post before) : I agree with you.
---
Cheers!
---
I crash 3-5 times a day. It was getting better before ..I don't know, the lying lowe questline was added, I think, but it's been getting progressively less stable as time goes on for me, on PC.   
---
I crashed drinking beer one day, I crashed eating meat yesterday, I crash when looking at my pipboy to early on log in, I crash on re-spawn frequently...
---
Sounds like you're focusing too much on the main questline. Just explore. There are tons of hidden side quests around the map. If you hear screams in the woods, go follow them. Find a random computer in a shack, read about a drunken man's ramblings. It's just like fallout NV. You could go straight to NV, but you will probably get ur butt kicked
---
Is that the winding path one?
---
Lol it does...as they say a females perception!
---
Sorry to necro-post on this, but I just had it happen to me and figured it out.  If you're running Aquagirl/boy, it has no effect.
---
I'm sorry man that sucks.
---
Can you wear the tattered dress and shielded underarmor?
---
Literally throw a dart at any point in the SE corner of the map? I‚Äôve been outta the loop for a bit. Did they start reducing static spawn zones when on a quest for it? Man. That‚Äôd blow if so. Cheers
---
I'd say that's some bad advice. Following it while you're still in the forest is great. Following it when you're getting shredded by mobs 3 times your level due to shitty game design...not so much.  There's a giant section of the map the game doesn't ever point you to at all that is _designed_ for low level players, and that's a tragedy.
---
I used the auto grenade launcher for a bit but... I was as likely to blow myself up as I was my enemies. Stopped using them after they got nerfed and no longer benefited from both heavy perks and explosive perks. Haven't used a missile launcher in ages. They BADLY need a buff man. If they just did more damage against very large enemies or something (like 10x more damage), I might pull my B50 missile launcher out of storage.
---
I'm not asking for much nor am I asking them to scale back group content, what's wrong with wanting more stuff I can do alone?
---
So... I'm going to throw out a couple things here, hopefully it will be taken in the right way, I'm just trying to help you!
---
Is it possible that you assigned it to your vending? It's fairly easy to do if you are moving a lot of items at their base value. I'd go check your stash first thing to eliminate that possibility.  
---
Second,  you've said that this has happened multiple times to you. What platform are you on? Have you recognized any pattern? What did you do just prior to logging off? Had you just fast traveled? I've got a bit over 800 hours in and I've not heard or seen of this since the first week or two and most of those turned out to be the result of spamming while the server was lagging...were you by chance have server issues,  like heavy lagging, during the last session you know you had the weapon?
---
Thank you. But why?? Doesn't that mean players can just come in and trash your camp and kill you while you're using a workbench?
---
You can claim them on your 2019 taxes as a write off
---
You read my mind!!!! I just got on to play for a hour before I leave for work and I was like ok let me equip my sword and adventure the forest.
---
They are useful but aside from putting them in atoms shop I'd like them to allow us to make them in game with large amount of junks, no one buys them anyway.
---
They aren't visible on adventure unless you have a vending machine on to sell to other players. Same should apply in survival. By default they are not visible in either game mode.
---
I dig the pack with BoS Engineers and Scribe outfits. On the engineers the tank actually clips with the pack but it looks appropriate in its own way.
---
Black shovel is definitely the best one currently in my eyes, the standard is okay thats what I put my reefer on to visually distinguish them.
---
Ps4
---
Amen.
---
They're only visible if your vending machines are powered up. Turn them off before jumping to survival and you'll be fine. 
---
Word of warning, be very cautious around other player vendor camps. Turrets are automatically hostile.
---
These people are at every single queen fight I've ever died at. They aren't rare at all.
---
True but in 3 there are few problems like a weapon not working right or the game killing you by not functioning. I believe some unique flamers are unaffected by pyromaniac perk perk for instance but other than that all bugs in other Bethesda games are only marginally annoying or prevent you from finishing a quest. In other words the gameplay mechanics of the other games work much better. All weapons and perks work as described in 3, bodies don't disappear in 3, and in 3 there isn't respawn issues since it just loads last save but in 76 there is a respawn system and it is broken
---
I‚Äôm there as well. Bought 1000 shotgun shells yesterday morning off a vendor selling them for 1 cap each.  Passed a few others selling them for 2 or 3 caps each. Not interested. 
---
The locked purifiers are annoying.  The way I see it it‚Äôs a cost of doing business.  I don‚Äôt help myself to free water unless I buy something or repair something or kill something attacking a camp.  Again, cost of doing business.  I also close the doors I open and don‚Äôt wreck shit.  
---
But I‚Äôll admit it‚Äôs a pet peeve - people that lock their purifiers.  I won‚Äôt buy a damn thing from you or help defend your camp if you are going to be that much of a tightwad.
---
Workshops are for farming Plans. IMO.
---
I just wish I could find some stuff worth buying. Someone just has to have the Vampire plasma gattle of my dreams.
---
Man, there not literally stopping me from playing, but they're definently stunting my enjoyment smart man.
---
Oh sorry I missed that.
---
Try teaming up with other players, and equip the inspirational perk for extra exp. As long as you tag an enemy you‚Äôll get the exp and drops from the kill.
---
Because, the players doing it can't cut it in a world where other players are fighting back. They'd rather kill and rob players 200 levels below their own.
---
Hahahaha
---
If you cannot keep your junk safe, you do not deserve it. I promise I will give it a better home.
---
I guess not, maybe 10 stims and 10 radaway and some food.
---
Save them for the Bug Daily. The only one that can spoil is rad roach meat, so I keep the other 4 in stash to make it easier to complete every day. Hard part is remembering to not auto-scrap em.
---
Same here. Everytime I log on I turn in technical data and I've never gotten the plans.
---
Only if you have no intention of using gauss rifles.
---
Go to adventure mode, go back to the forest, get some wood, build a camp.
---
Then grab a 2 handed melee or a pump action shotgun and start your rampage.
---
That's the issue. People warming to THIS bit of inappropriate behavior just paves the path for future shitty behavior from the company. 
---
If this wasn't implemented as a push to make you buy micro-transaction currency, we'd be able to list the repair kits like everything else, and I'd be FINE with that. That would be AWESOME. 
---
The issue isn't the repair kits. Its the fact that the VP of the company either has zero say in the future of micro-transactions in this company, or he lied to our faces. Neither of which are good things.
---
If I‚Äôm doing a Whitesprings run I‚Äôll swap out fireproof and swap in 3* rad resistance. It‚Äôs all you need to do. I use rad x quite a bit to suppress mutations.
---
As a rifle and shotgun guy the 556 and 45 and shells are prime ordinance for me.  I‚Äôll bet I have purchased close to 15K caps worth since player vending went online.  Yet I still have close to 25K to spend.
---
They devalue junk and allow evasion of game mechanics.
---
Those are my two biggest complaints. Honestly they would have been far more interesting if players could have crafted and sold them.
---
I like the repair kit as a thing in game, I just hate how they are a thing that kind of sidesteps the whole in game economy and social interaction.
---
PS4 mostly, but PC sometimes. More friends play on PS4. :\
---
Joining or elevator doesn't matter. Either I or someone on my team has a client freeze/crash or a hand full of other problems happen - frame rate drops, enemies don't spawn in but you still take damage, etc. Happens on PC just as much and is widely reported as a problem by players. We don't have potato internet and our PCs are fine.
---
Surprisingly, the least issues come from the PS4 standard player. He's our anchor to the instance when everything breaks down.
---
I can definitely say we've run arktos a lot more than 3 or 4 times.....
---
Wanted no, but it should open them up to PvP, if only just to you. Maybe also temporarily server locked so if they try to leave they automatically drop the loot.
---
IMO... nothing should be visible on the map with regards to other players in Survival mode. Nothing.
---
No
---
Dont think their is another way besides maybe buying off someone who has an extra. This whole rng is ridiculous. I turned in 100+ and barely got the Bomber jacket and my friend turns in 2 and gets the bomber jacket lol... some people have all the luck.
---
Heck
---
I have a bloody explosive build and while I'm still not fully leveled on this character yet it seems to preform great. Max demo and grenadier are musts. I'm also having fun with last laugh (drop grenade on death) with nuka and plasma grenades.
---
they gone...
---
2 days ago i spawned into my CAMP, and right were i spawned in was one of my 3 star armors, it was just lying on the ground, not in a paper bag
---
i couldnt pick it up!
---
it was just stuck there on the ground, it showed me the name of it when I put my cursor on it, but couldnt pick it up
---
I remember there was a previous bug where sometimes you would drop a document (was it a technical data?) when you spawned in, and like my situation you could see it but couldnt pick it up
---
so, it seems this bug has mutated and returned
---
Most deaf players don't have a "group of players to play with" in this game precisely because there is no way for them to communicate in any way with them on the PC. Instead of trying to make work around and excuses we need to hold bethesda to a higher standard when it comes to how they treat disabled players.
---
This is one of the only games I've every seen that is a online multiplayer game on the pc that doesn't have a text features specifically because of deaf players, women who don't want to be harassed, and people who have speech impairments such as stuttering. The fact that they are just ignoring the disabled isn't cool and needs to be pushed and not ignored.
---
If you're in pacifist they can't destroy your camp unless you initiate PvP with them.

Yeah I made a post about this and people argued with me that they "need their rad arch", well duh of course you do, but put a switch on it so people aren't forced to use it. 
---
I still think if we had FT mats we could just place them near our Vending machines and then people wouldn't have to worry about where people spawn into their camps.
---
The hiccup in the Heart of the Enemy is due to the note "Mission 099-01 Orders" being the trigger to add 'power up the generator' quest stage. This stage isn't bypassed when the quest resets (you can retrieve DNA sample just fine), so you need to go read the note each day. The note cannot be picked up.
---
Once the note has been read, you can access the terminals properly even if you have already inserted the DNA sample.
---
This can be rectified by changing the way the triggers fire, allowing the note to be picked up or by adding 'VTU terminal password' as a key when the note is read, so players cannot drop it.
---
Easy solution. Turn off the power to your PVMs before you go in to Survival. Mine are all connected to one conduit which is connected to the Generator. Just have to remove one cable and my Camp is invisible
---
Yep.  I do drop some items but nothing too extreme
---
I played (more like farmed) pretty much all day yesterday and no crash. Even had Netflix on for a while at the same timeüëç
---
Stutter and FPS drops are still a very consistent issue on consoles
---
The fps drops especially in events like ISQ and Project Paradise are especially bad and I still crash at Arktos 50% of the time
---
Consistently not being able to buy essential things like plans from vendors I'd arise is fairly game breaking
---
That document bug has always been with me. Nukashine label and tech documents every login. 
---
Never seen the items but wouldn‚Äôt surprise me.
---
I hope they fix it, as I like rebuilding my base in a new area fairly often. Was starting to think it was time for a move. Just got the signs and letters plan, so I need to rebuild a smaller structure as I have no budget left.
---
Yes but the dress is over the top of it
---
There is some great advice here, not much I can add other than saying that the 20's are the most grindy levels in game. Once you hit 30-35 you'll most likely see a shift in difficulty.
---
I'm working on a Mistress of Mysteries build. Pistols, 1h melee (swords), and stealth. She won't be OP by any means, but it should be fun.
---
Basically, it unlocks 100% of the time if you go find the weird NPC robot that thinks he's a dog right after you start the timer up, and he tells you to go to the basement to get a shutdown code,  and then you shut down the evil robot machine and he takes over.  You won't get it if you fail but even if just 1 animal survives, you should get the unlock.
---
Can we also get the camp stoves (the green and yellow ‚Äúsuitcase‚Äù ones) for our camps?
---
Ok I got my black diamond sword. Have a decent camp. And I'm sitting in the forest region chopping down super mutants and hounds. This helps so much. I appreciate y'all.
---
Hmm, thanks for the info. Ghoulish is pretty good, while in a nuke zone I just use that and when I get too many rads I pop a rad away then boom, due to the radiation health just regens as fast as I lose rads
---
Not multiple times to me.  To others. 
---
And no.  I checked vending just in case but it‚Äôd be more likely I‚Äôd sell my balls before I‚Äôd sell that gun.
---
And lag? That‚Äôs a joke, right?
---
Game has never not lagged.  Not since day one.
---
Anyways. Appreciate the pointers but I spent two hours trying to figure this out before I just accepted it was that damn bug hitting me.
---
This is also hundreds of years after nuclear war some degradation on armor and weapons his highly understandable. They don't have the gear or technology to make that stuff anymore let alone at the strength it used to be.
---
Edit: oh yeah this is on the fallout 76 subreddit so I guess it's only a few years after but even still everything's rusted to shit already. And metal when it gets rusted it's way easier to break.
---
Try the cemetery upper right side map where the the blackpowder guns are in display cases.
---
 Forgot the name of the place but found the tourists there in the cemetery.
---
Bro can you relax, literally all I did was offer you a temporary solution. No need to get uppity with me, I never said Bethesda shouldn't offer more support for disabled players. I'm trying to help give you options. If you dont have a group of players maybe as I said before you should start your own discord server for disabled and hearing impaired players to connect them. Then you can enjoy not only fallout together but other games as well as casual discussion. Then you can post your server here and invite others to join. It's not too difficult to have your phone next to you or a second monitor in order to use the discord while playing, if anything it's even easier than in game chats most of the time.
---
The version of skyrim they are selling for the switch for $60 right now has a game breaking bug in it where you get _stuck in the elder scroll_ that was known about within the first week of launch for that title...what, most of a decade ago now? 
---
I can't speak to 3. It was a lackluster experience for me, I didn't play it nearly as much as I did 1, 2, new vegas, or 4, so I haven't run into as many bugs there as I have in other bethesda fallout games, and in the elder scrolls line of games..so you might be right about _that_ title, but over-all? no. 
---
Bethesda games are _chock full_ of annoying, game breaking bugs.
---
ü§î guess gotta go drag for that extra 1p then
---
What platform are you on?
---
I actually think it looks OK with the shovel backpack, I also sometimes use the engineer outfit and when I do I use the shovel backpack.
---
I was thinking of that awhile ago. Or least a build for each of the unstoppables.
---
I didn‚Äôt even know I had any until my main weapon broke during a SBQ event. I went to switch weapons and accidentally clicked on my main weapon and it asked if I wanted to use a repair kit (or whatever the actual verbiage is) so I did. After the event I went through my inventory and found I had 30+ of them. So while I personally wouldn‚Äôt spend real money on them, they can be handy. I still go to my camp and repair my weapons/armor to 200%, but it‚Äôs nice to have the repair kits for situations like above.
---
Going straight north in NV towards the quest marker is a great way to die.
---
Yeah, thats right. It does give healing outside of combat, but the description just makes it look like natural healing x4, generally it needs a new description and a better definition.
---
Git gud scrub.
---
Basic repair kits are pay to lose for the truly lazy. You can over repair your gear at workstations. Kill sbq for a handful of improved repair kits as emergencies and you're good to go.
---
I can in about 2.5 hours!
---
Yeah, I'm not sure how you can play this game and not make money.  I've had to shut down my machines on more than one occasion because I was approaching caps cap.  Then I have to go and find something, anything to buy which many nights is harder than it appears.  I've taken to investing in items I know I can sell back out at the same price or for a very small profit just so i dont lose caps.
---
 I'm a bit puzzled by the Scorchbeast insta-kill. Now they are my toy and I play with them quite a bit and the "super gamma waves" do nothing to me, except obscure my vision a bit.
---
 Now I'm set up for that, but even when I was not and ran and hid from them, they never insta-killed me. Are you running around naked or what?
---
Honestly when i run unyielding and 19% health and my per is like 32 w ua and base 15 i don't really notice a difference than when it's 15 only.  Maybe drop the dress ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Mayor for a day starts in places a L15 should probably not be.
---
You can start the quests anytime.  The objective (subjectively) is to not complete them until near level 50, as yes, the reward is scaled to the level you are at the time you finish the quest.    
---
I completed wavy willards quest about L20, I stopped using the reward by L35.
---
Roses and Mysteries, I complete after I made L50.  I'm L90 now, and I still carry/use those rewards.
---
  There's a bunch of places in the forest with high super mutant counts, which will give you lots of XP and weapons to scrap.  
---
IMHO, at 15, you should still be roaming the forest and trying to follow the overseers quest.  It will keep you more or less in level appropriate areas.
---
Next time you are at Top Of The world, head to the top and pick up roses quest.  It'll take a while, and will eventually lead you to areas you are not ready be in quite yet.
---
Since you are already in the charleston area, stop off at riverside manor and pick up the mysteries quest, then go to the SE corner of the ash heap and pick up the excavator quest.
---
I believe Deathclaw hides can also be found in piles of Scorchbeast poo...
---
A lvl 50 set of T51b has a higher ballistic AND energy resistance than BOTH Ultraicte and X1 PA. It also has every PA mod available as an option. No reason to use any other PA.
---
Suggestion A could possibly work in Survival, but i think in adventure mode it is just to suck it up. It sucks, sure. But it is a part of the game and it is there to make death be a punishment for you, not for the guy who lived.
---
Compulsory upvote whenever this subject comes up.
---
Indeed, about 7200 is the lowest Fallout 4 has been at over the last week, it is literally impossible for the average to be 3500. These numbers do not however mean that only ~10000 people play Fallout 4 on PC, because players are in game only for a fraction of the time, rather than 24/7. In any case, while a similar count after half a year is not a major success, it is hardly a dead game either, Rage 2 did worse already after a few days.
---
It may also be too early to write off an online game just because it does not have a huge player population early, for example, [The Elder Scrolls Online](https://steamdb.info/app/306130/graphs/) on Steam was at only a few thousand concurrent players all the way until November 2016, but then it took off and is now more active than Fallout 4, and is a top game by [gross revenue](https://store.steampowered.com/sale/winter2018bestof/) as well. A similar improvement may or may not happen with Fallout 76, it depends on how good the updates are in the future. [BGS Austin is expanding](https://jobs.zenimax.com/locations/view/53) at least, so it does not look like the company is giving up on the game.
---
I'm not being uppity, if I were I'd bring up the fact that by not including text feature in the game they are actually breaking EU laws. You are the one that seems to keep banging on about "oh get discord" well, no one should have to, as for one. Discord is a shit company that sells your personal info, so fuck them. Two, it isn't the disabled persons job to "make do" with a multi million dollar company shitting on them because they are either too lazy or incompetent to add text chat to the game.
---
Also, most deaf people don't carry phones, because surprise surprise without a TTY system they can't use them.
---
I had gotten back into Fallout 76 since release a couple days ago and was making good progress. Grinded to my backpack, killed my first SQB, set up a profitable shop.
---
Thing is, I'm a hoarder, I cannot help it, it's just who I am. I can't just let go of what can be of use. So I run with all the perks that reduce weight as I can, and often move around with about 800 lbs on me. That's fine with me, I never fast travel in Bethesda games anyway for the immersion. It allows me to find what others don't, and know the map like the back of my hand instead of having to look at it.
---
Then 2 days ago I took over a power plant to produce some fusion cores since my gatling laser was taking a lot of them and my squadmate stayed there while I went shopping. As I'm in morgantown, I hear him get upset about a guy that came in to the power plant, saying that he's getting one shot. I get back there as fast as I can and find a guy with marsupial bunny hopping around with a TSE combat shotgun. I killed him twice with my gatling laser and I thought it'd be the end of it.
---
But nope, he came back about 5 minutes later. This time he made sure he had 90% rads and was equipped with what I imagine was his Anti-Armor Bloodied Railway Rifle. Guy kept bunny hopping around spamming it and eventually a stray shot did hit me... and I was dead. While wearing full X-01 power armor.
---
So he took all my junk, 3000 lbs worth (compacted into 300 by pack rat to be exact) and left the server so we couldn't kill him again. I had like 1700 lead, a lot of springs and screws, basically any material you would need for anything. I was the one who ran repair perks and fixed up my friends' gear or crafted stuff in their camp. It was pretty upsetting and I haven't been wanting to touch the game since.
---
tl;dr: I'm a hoarder and got one hit killed by a dude who took my stuff and bailed
---
Here I am waiting on a simple text chat added. Gotta be hidden when not in use tho.
---
Try the Colonel Kelly Monument and Phillipi Cemetary. They are only 1 cap away from each other, so it's cheap to server hop, check both spots, and hop again.
---
If you need any help with anything my gamertag is Bekbekk94 :)
---
One day we'll get it, one day
---
Oh really? That‚Äôs good to know. It was a little time consuming getting that code and entering it, but it was great to see the animals get a health boost between rounds. Plus no violent robots which helps. Thanks for the info!
---
1- remove the wall in the way.
---
2 - connect the wire 
---
3 - replace the wall
---
Thats awesome
---
My primed ultracite gatling had infinite cores for some reason two days ago.
---
What system are you on?  I think I still have some in my vending machine. PS4
---
Except it happens with X-01 and Ultracite PA as well, both of which are brand new, and weren't created til post war.
---
The astronaut helmet serves  as gas mask in the shop
---
I would check the vendors at whitesprings for the normal tents - unfortunately I'm not sure which exact vendor sells them. 
---
You can get a pioneer scouts tent plan randomly from doing the Campfire Tales event!
---
It‚Äôs coming pretty soon, also red rocket tower is the best
---
I wrote a note with the small letters set on my shop front that said "I need 2 revive some1 4 back pack unlock plz!" and the second customer happily obliged, after I showed them the cliff next to my base. by jumping off and dying next to them, giving them the revive achievement too (if they needed it, we didn't speak, lol)
---
I think I still have a spare one in my vendor. If you're on PC I'll pull it out and hold it for you. I think I had it priced at like 500 caps.
---
X01 is cuter. Fite me lol
---
But that can be glitchy and looks crappy.
---
Power conduits keep it clean. No glitches and is built in.
---
Yeah I also always sell my plans for 15 caps because I live in the far south east of the cranberry bog, so I have to make my customers count.
---
Yeah , it definitly takes a person out of the collection game for a good minute but well worth it, especially if you get some of the weaker animals with low AR
---
You can get the hat at a cemetery on top of hopewell cave, and you can get the union uniform, confederate uniform, civil war era dress, civil war era top hat, and a bunch of black powder weapons at Philipi battle cemetery as well. The civil war reenactor I'm pretty sure can only spawn in the toxic valley, BTW.
---
If you are wanted, there should be a little red cap with an amount somewhere at the bottom of your screen.  Or, maybe just no one's vending.
---
If your wanted you wont see anybody
---
I see it all the time. I honestly wish that Bethesda would of made it that you couldn‚Äôt transfer players to other modes. It would have been way more exciting seeing people start fresh low levels trying to build new characters and trying to obtain new gear everyone would be using the survival reward weapons and the balance would actually be there because players that were able to use the exp glitch or obtain gear from duper‚Äôs would all be relatively the same levels and I think would of brought a lot of pve players into the mode. Instead they just see people complaining that they get killed all the time or bullied and so with the way things are in normal society naturally people complain and there for Bethesda nerfs the game due to people being op. The first time I started engaging in pvp I went from 13000 caps to 5k just from trying to actually kill some one. That‚Äôs why I started a new player when there was the double xp weekend. And only really use that player in pvp. Once you build your first character you learn what perks are more valuable and what stats you should have. I think at level 50 there should be a chance to re stat yr character. And choose all new 50 perks.
---
I also have many aid that i don't want to lose.
---
I did the workshop part with a alt lvl 4.
---
It took me 5 servers because there were always campers ,that totally had to kill me for a gran 1 cap and zero loot.
---
Had my Fasnacht Beret and Shielded Vault Suit vanish on me on Saturday. Wasn't pleased. Friendly fellow player hooked me up with another beret for 500 caps, found a Shielded BoS Officer in a vendor...still a bit salty about it however. Was on PC, no real indicators as to why (was just mucking about CAMP).
---
They were both named, and it makes me worried its tied to that system some how.
---
I rarely crash unless I'm in a nuked zone. I could spend 5 hours of doing anything else and be fine but if I try to go into a nuked zone it will freeze eventually.
---
Yes... its because you are wanted. Lets someone kill you
---
First time seeing the SBQ I launched the nuke. She would NOT stop flying out of the nuke zone and back in, only to repeat. It would land, then instantly fly back up.
---
This really sucked
---
\+1
---
Indeed
---
That would be wonderful. I am on PC.  Thank you. :D Sent you my ID directly.
---
Okay thank you. That must be the reason why. Nobody wants to kill me for the caps though lmao
---
Took a ton of farming for me to get it.  Strangely, it has dropped more than once and I even sold some in my vendor station.    I don't keep count but I've probably passed 120.   I  got a   BOS T60 paint on my 3rd drop but it took well over 100 to get the second one.  The RNG is pretty merciless in this quest.
---
my experience with survival mode was being ambushed by clearly overpowered other players and them melting me in a nano second.
---
Beatle looking head ass... lol.
---
Not sure of the practicalities but if we ever get a quickswap ability for skill cards I want to stock up on booze and run a support build with Quack Surgeon (revive players with booze).
---
Tuxedos from Atom Shop too, if you have Atoms to spare
---
Large Tent can be purchased from the Responder vendor in Whitesprings
---
Yeah it's from tech data. And yes the rng is ridiculous. I've done hundreds on one toon, got all the BOS paint but still no underarmor plans. Another toon got them on first hand in.
---
Just go to whitespring sta. Stash your junk, remove your armor, and await justice.
---
How do you initiate the event?
---
me and my friends have seen something similar to this, but also noted that on a low pop server the odd of getting legendary gear on non-legendary goes up. a few time when doing whitesprings run when there was only 5-6 players we found almost every ghoul had a legendary some times 2, desite not having the legendary title or a \*. This is mostly anecdotal, but if the server is rolling RNG as an even spread across all players (similar to how network slot machines work due to gaming regulations and have a statis return value set) it could mean that the server has a % chance on per kill that a player on the server will get a legendary. think of it like this if the server has 25% legendary item spawn rate per kill and you have 24 players then it would get divided up to were most legendary kills would meet the requirement. but if you have a team a 4 people an no one else then its possible the server would compensate the amount of legendary items given. again this is something we only observed a handful of time as its hard to reproduce lately after player vending was added.
---
Too me it's too wide. I don't really need it right now so I only use it when I do. 
---
The keep out skin is too long. 
---
I'm not really going to be happy with it until the sloth or Mr Fuzzy (or mothman pappoose) skins come out. (If at all)
---
I dont really use them at all. Shame I cant sell ones Ive got.
---
My Big Iron! Build has that I as a perk. And the one that removes addiction from booze. So I can revive and get sauced.  And the think has the one than improves luck as well.
---
Days isn‚Äôt an mmo in that sense. It‚Äôs a survival mmo built around that. Falllout isn‚Äôt.
---
You should have got them to die in water to double up on badge requirements.
---
I'm still trying to do the water revive
---
Thanks, my dude.
---
Agree.
---
Slow clap intensifies.
---
Vendors. I've found them pretty consistently at Sutton station.
---
It works on the bolt-action rifle, but not the pipe revolver; re: stacking pistol + rifle. Arguably, 1 point in each level of both lines is more efficient perk/damage wise, and you only need 3 points of licensed plumber to get 5 points worth of weapon degradation reversal. I would definitely go stealth crit as well.
---
I use ultracite 5mm so I'm limited to how much ammo I can make for myself. Based on this thread.. I'm going to start to be a 5.56 manufacturing plant!
---
I always sell at the lowest possible cost of 1 cap/per. I can't sell at 0 else I'd never benefit from my efforts.
---
look for me PC ign "FarPlace".
---
They changed the system.  Before, repairing items made them better.  Most armors got bonus DR/ER, and melee weapons got better damage.  
---
They changed it so that item stats are no longer affected due to condition which imo removes the "pay to win" aspect of repair kits which was my only objection.  
---
So yeah I don't see much of an issue now that repairing doesn't make your character more powerful by increasing your dr or dmg.
---
The new xbox game bar has group chat, including voice, text and image iirc
---
Press Windows + G
---
What they need is a category for crafting items that can be used in their complete form rather than scrapped form for the things like the bottles and deathclaw hands and bulked scrap. Junk that's not junk, Sugar Bombs that aren't Sugar Bombs, and Royal Jelly that isn't royal jelly is pretty sloppy.
---
Just get your guns out, run up to people and do the pvp emote. Someone will eventually take you up on the caps. Give them some thumbs ups and maybe a gift afterwards to show no hard feelings.
---
sometimes in fact, the meat pile will re-appear where the enemy intially spawned in at, not where you killed it
---
usually when you get those "disappearing bodies" they will do this
---
Yeesh, while I'd love it... I can only imagine the strain on a servers, with 9 bajillion items spawning into existence.
---
Todd......ok.......We know it Todd.........ok......
---
Yeah I noticed. I love it. 
---
But does the traveling coat and backpack clip like the trapper torso? Or does it remove the backpack?
---
Yes. It's my main
---
There will always be cheapskates. Always.
---
Looks hella awesome in my opinion. 
---
Good choice ;)
---
Good post. Yea, it would seem to me that survival mode is much closer to the game they wanted to make but it changed a lot after people freaked out that their precious ideas of Fallout were solo player experiences. it's still knocked all outta wack by the builds and the way the meta settles in PVP games that feature these type of builds. 
---
This is a real bummer. I hate that so many fallout players are ANTI-PVP. Really upsets me. This thinking killed what would've been a fleshed out PVP in the wasteland full of tension and trust and survival. PVP paranoia is the most misguided and thoughtless shit. Ruined an aspect of this game that could've been so awesome.
---
i jsut wish my VATS and Melee actually worked, its still broken for over a month now
---
What does the pioneer scout tent look like?
---
You're going to love having 2 fps in your camp!
---
2 things:
---
1. clear out your friends list. pending requests seem to cause stuttering.  Accept or decline but don't let any stay pending.
---
2. Use the "verify and repair" option in the launcher.  
---
Those 2 things will at least reduce this.  Won't solve it though, you will still get hitches but they will be shorter and less frequent.
---
I'd really love to see this problem fixed though.
---
It doesnt show the backpack at all last i checked.
---
You go to camp adams at night time. sometimes you have to walk down the hill and walk back up or re-fast travel to trigger it.
---
I like RMS, Dicks also has them. If you want cheap, walmart. 
---
If they dont have them, campfire tales. 
---
Go to that pioneer scout camp just north of nuka cola in the night-ish...maybe like 8pm and that can start the event. It's a pretty easy event too. Good acid farming.
---
hell ye lol
---
It's really surprising to me that people suppress mutations at all.
---
This perk could be a lil useful but wouldn't it be nice if they can let us choose whether to suppress our mutations when taking Rad X, so you don't even need to switch to rad resistance.
---
It doesn't have to be on Starched Genes tho, I just picked a perk that has similar traits.
---
Damn good points. Maybe take up a new hobby like miming where you won't have to worry about a multi million dollar company "shitting on you". You've got all the qualifications already dick head.
---
This fixed it thanks!
---
Are you seeing anything in your event viewer?
---
I don't know if they would actually stand up in PvP (probably not given the wacky builds), but in PvE, the Bloodied one can do solid damage at 400+ a shot.  And though it doesn't have the fastest fire rate in the world, you can go for 500 shots before you need to reload and it basically sips ammo compared to other heavy weapons like the Minigun.  Anything short of a Scorchbeast or similar boss-type enemies drops in 1-3 shots, so that's pretty darn efficient.
---
Dont forget the t51 is cheaper to repair than x01 and Ultracite. ;)
---
That said, while I am a primary t51 user, I have to say I prefer x01 for nuke zones.  The extra rad resist means a lot less maintenance over the long haul of raiding the nuke zone.  Just a QoL increase.
---
 You lose junk, not loot. Is yours important? Mine ain't.
---
Interesting, I don‚Äôt have that issue with that quest- my problem is I just get a stupid minigun every time I turn it in. :(
---
Edit: referring the Heart of the Enemy, I‚Äôve never had the other trigger.
---
Glad I could help\~
---
Bethesda, please give us Kilts for the male characters (with a sporran and scarf) with the  +1 Perception
---
Since it requires the rocket structure to be destroyed to launch it, and now CAMPS are indestructible to players, it seems like they'll never launch again in Adventure mode.
---
nope, some servers are loaded
---
how else can you explain when almost EVERY ghoul drops a legendary? then other servers not one will at all
---
i do alot of farming, its obvious there are some servers better than others, i invite friends in that were farming on different servers, its fun to hear them get so excited-
---
"Another legendary! ANOTHER!!! ALL OF THEM ARE GIVING LEGENDARIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
---
 **Firecracker whiskey** was one of the drinks that you could get from  wasted on alcohol, as far as i know no one has gotten it.
---
On a side note, don't do a Google image search for "animal trapping" unless you wanna be sad.
---
Thank God. I tried to Google it and all top answers were just people asking if it was. Got a furious one and wanted to try it out.
---
Bloody Mess is working a bit too well it seems =P
---
Every time a SBQ dies, I get a lag spike. About half the time, in that spike, due to rads,the last spawn wave of mobs, or other factors, I die. 
---
And when I die, about 90% of the time, some soulless sack of shit comes in and scoops up that nice pile of consequence free flux. 
---
That's 600+ caps worth of mats, out the window, because some soulless piece of shit decided they liked the ability to, without consequence, steal from me due to two stupidly bad bits of game design.
---
No, people just stay at their Camps decorating
---
YES! FFS, YES!
---
i know how to stop it! simply dont push your controller dpad in any direction when leaving the workbench, then it will let you leave
---
if you try to move your dpad as you are leaving the workbench, it pulls you back in
---
its reproducible!
---
hope this helps
---
You get even more bonus if you complete the Mistress of Mystery quest.
---
The restaured Garb of Mystery give you +1 perception, 5% stealth (and 20% if you wear the Eye of Ra jewel).
---
It provide damage and energy resistance, but at the cost of being unable to wear any armor or clothing, save for glasses and hat.
---
It does have the interesting characteristic of being unbreakable and only weight 1, so if you want to do a mostly stealth-based character, save carry weight and never have to bother about fixing your broken armor or getting your armor broken in battle, this is the stuff you need.
---
Just to add, you can't wear armor with it, but you can use Power Armor and backpack with it.
---
When you log off, your camp is saved so when you log back in and join another server it just appears. I have never had my camp deleted, I'm pretty sure thats a very rare bug now. The different modes are Adventure, standard mode which is the same mode from when the game got released, Survival, also called hardcore, with a large focus on PVP and no restrictions on said PVP. There is no matchmaking for missions, you can do quests on your own or in a group, if you have friends. A little piece of advice from me is to join a discord server for Fallout 76, it just goes a long way into helping find people to play with and it's just fun to roleplay in a community. (Pls just join our's here: [https://discord.gg/uSedh7](https://discord.gg/uSedh7))
---
Yes that's what it's called
---
Those grenades are significantly more effect if you shoot them in vats. The MIRV is better when it explodes in the air. The Nuka has a small radius, so you need to get it to explode right on your target.
---
If you do it right, you can clear a swarm of ghouls within a second.
---
I want to double thumbs up this
---
simple, some players may be far less casual than you and run across bugs that you would not encounter at your depth of play.
---
I have a full compliment of 20 purifiers and they are all open. ya I loose about half of my water and your right it's COGS, cost of goods sold. &lt;-- real financial term.. woo hoo.. I'm a post apocalypse entrepreneur who rolls out solid financial advice diluted down with purified water. I would not recommend investments in housing!
---
Seems like it's better on xbox. I haven't played in 3 months though, so IDK. I'll play later today. I lagged out maybe twice a week, and I have bad wifi. I get literally 15 mbps, and that's after I optimized the damn xbox to use the best DNS settings! So you're probably lagging because; A: Your PC is slow. B: You have HORRIBLE wifi. C: You have a specific type of AMD processor that enjoys lagging out of specific games for no apparent reason (Xbox and PS4 both have different AMD processors, and either of them could have one of those bad processors). D: It's device related, and not AMD.
---
It's most likely C. I had a horrible PC. It was 1000 dollars though, but it had an AMD, rendering it mostly useless for gaming.
---
Makes sense!
---
I ended up buying it from a player vendor.  I sell the Shielded underarmor from time to time.
---
Like others have said, the odds you get from Forbidden Knowledge are pretty terrible.  It's got to be a ratio of at least 15-1, even for mundane stuff like the Engineer's Outfit.
---
I can help you, PSN longtrainrollin
---
I never played other Fo games, but knowing where to source certain weapon/armor types will definitely make it easier. In Fo 76 the most consistent source of armor is the scorchbeasts, nearly every single one of them dropped armor pieces for me, don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the case for everyone.
---
it's just open season 24/7. weapons hot. No pvp combat opt out.
---
All I can say is this has been happening to me as well. It appears to affect all consumables. It happened when I chowed down on a bobblehead least night.
---
I don't like people going over my bag after I died either, but I think it is reasonable to drop junk on death, at least they don't make you lose exp.
---
If it marks player as PvP/wanted then I think there would be trolls just dying on purpose waiting for people to pick up their stuff.
---
I usually went after midnight, though it did trigger earlier sometimes.
---
If you get there and there are corpses, hop servers.
---
Remove your armor to avoid reducing condition.
---
they both were, i had gotten 3 crafting items over nukashine before it stopped giving the quest. and tipsy still runs giving me the same plans over and over.
---
Deathclaw hides can befound in boxes at fort defiance
---
 Yeah maybe 600 caps to buy from vendors, but that is not at all what its worth.
---
 I'm sad for your lag spike, my PC does not do it that much, so its not a problem for many of us. Still its junk, I hardly ever go back for mine as it will be trivial, from my point of view.
---
Thank you! I will look for a plan!
---
You could craft both versions.

i assume you've tried all 3 vsync options? i had mini stutters and frame drops until i set my vsync to the "fast" option in the nvidia control panel
---
It's really strange that the main way the story is delivered is via holotape, which has zero playback controls.
---
Imagine listening to an audiobook with no pause, no play, no progress bar...
---
What are you saying lmao no you cant
---
How did you start the nuka shine 1 a second time?
---
I agree. The whole Anti-PVP Community really ruined the game for me a lil with all the raider threads being downvoted to oblivion.
---
Honestly wish they left the ability to do 1% of damage to a player.
---
Yeah, I have over 50 of them and depending on how often I run the SBQ or Encryptid, I actually have little reason to do manual repairs at all and have stayed afloat solely on these since they've ben introduced.  Like you say, they actually have a weight of 0.1, which is kind of irritating... wish it was more like .05.
---
You get the regular ones on the atom shop and the better ones are rewarded fighting the SBQ
---
I won't be on for another 5 hours but send me a request anyways!
---
Regular are shop only, Improved are rewarded by completing Scorched Earth
---
You can get improved repair kits from doing events like the SBQ. They repair to 150% - normal repair kits only come from the atom shop
---
I'm level 145 and have played since beta.
---
Go to your work bench and find that you actually have a plan for the backpack and maybe craft one that has a better carry weight. level 50 gives you +60 carry weight.
---
If you have one, why would you ask. Equip your rifle perks, look at the number. Unequip them and look at the number.
---
 Mystery solved!
---
While not the same glitch its definately relevant. However, I personally haven't seen this glitch since I stopped farming the whitespring and doing straight jacket runs at the asylum.  Kind of assumed they fixed it lol
---
Mine was a card with a code from there, that was when it first released though
---
SBQ event or Imposter sheepsquatch, maybe a few others. Note these are free and called improved repair kits which repair to 150% condition. 
---
The ones in atom shop are just plain repair kits and only do 100% condition. 
---
In game free are clearly better.
---
I disagree. Plans, ore, and 300+ XP for 2 minutes of minimal effort. Opinions are like assholes, we all have them.
---
It rewards that plan to me pretty frequently, think I've got two in my vendor. Probably worth checking some player shops. Event is pretty damned easy though.
---
You can buy them in the Atom Shop or by running the scorched earth event and beating the SBQ.
---
Sometimes a reward for scorched earth. Other than that you have to buy them for atom shop.
---
PVP is a broken mess, of course it won't stand up unless you're using a bloodied explosive laser or handmade. 
---
As for playing in the actual game, yeah the gatling gun is great. With the right perks it goes well above 100 damage per shot and is good even at long range. It's extremely ammo efficient, too. That makes it the perfect weapon to bring to a scorchbeast queen fight. It's accurate enough to hit her while she's flying around, has enough range to deal good damage even while she flies, and does not waste an hour's worth of ammo like the .50 cal
---
PC?
---
"FarPlace"
---
Can vendors sell them?
---
Not even train stations! üòè
---
Ok i did it again with video.I got deathclaw now and sheepsquatch.Used one stimpak for safe but i did it.Where i can put the video?
---
Since you mentioned it... How do you build down? I can only build up and/or out. How you going down with the camp from foundation level?
---
Yeah, crafting both would be the change.
---
Ok i have video about it.I did better than yesterday.Where i can share the video?
---
I agree I just think fallout 76 has more problems than usual even for Bethesda. Plus the multiplayer server nature of the game makes the risk/loss much much worse. In other fallout games if u have to reboot u can still find the same spot you crashed on, in 76 if it crashes during an event or scorch queen then you can't just jump back to it necessarily. There's placement loss and data loss and lots of other irreversible shit that will happen to you only in fallout 76
---
You forgot - Mothman
---
Compared to other heavy weapons how well would you say it preforms against the SBQ? I was thinking of using one of these to trigger LotD more than an auto heavy would
---
Like player vendors? Maybe the ones that you get from scorched Earth but probably not the basic ones since you her them from the atom shop. Honestly I don't think they're worth it. The basic ones only fix your stuff to 100% and the other ones l, that I've seen so far, only fix to like 150%. Just not worth having...in my opinion. I'm sure there's people who feel differently
---
Hard to give advice based on your post but a few tips:
---
* When you scrap weapons, you learn new mods you can then use to make a better version of that weapon.  So if you are using say, hunting rifles, scrap a ton of them so you can craft better mods using a weapon crafting bench.
---
* Same as above for armor.
---
* Weapons and armor have levels.  So if you are level 20 but still using level 1 armor and weapons, you are gimping yourself and not ready to face level 20 enemies.  Buy or craft weapons and armor that are your level and whenever possible use the crafting system to make these items better.
---
* Perks are important.  focus on one weapon class and take perks to increase the damage for that type of weapon.  Specializing will make you stronger.
---
* aim for the head to deal increased damage.
---
Pimp of Paranormal. There. Tossed in my two cents.
---
Most of the complaints about them weren't ever valid to begin with. I've got plenty of them from SBQ fights and sheepsquatch events. They're all just sitting in my stash because I never need them. It's a convenience item at best. It's not even a crutch because I highly doubt somebody is willing to shell out the money to regularly use nothing but repair kits for all of their gear. From what I've seen, the only changes this makes is for people who are too lazy to spend 3 minutes getting some resources or those who don't care about the atom shop cosmetics. Lazy people are happy, and people who never spent their atoms before are also happy. I am unaffected. So who cares
---
My only complaint is that they're not tradeable. I can understand the basic atom shop ones, since there's already a precedent of all atom shop items being tied to the person who bought it, but you get improved repair kits from events. You should be able to sell those, at least. I'm most likely never going to use mine, I wouldn't mind giving them to somebody who values them
---
Bit of an exaggeration on the 400%. Its not like you can just grab a weapon that is bloodied and magically become invincible. I can get killed by a cave cricket. Or one shotted by a high level super mutant. Encryptid event? Yeah im going to die 30 times if i dont switch my build up and pull out my troubleshooters armor/weapons or my vanguard sentinals. Scortchbeast queen? Have to switch to my zealots weapons...There are pros and cons to being bloodied.
---
For future referwnce, type the weapon name into the wiki. It will say what weapon type it is.
---
 https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Railway_rifle_(Fallout_76)
---
This is the best answer. Queen drops like 4? 6? Imposter I believe drops 2
---
Appreciate the offer but I'm XBox.
---
I followed a low level today in the water park in hope but he / she just wouldn't die. I opened a trade and they had no stimpack but somehow managed to clear the whole park so I left disappointed.
---
Have tried many times at the imposter sheepsquatch event too.
---
I'll manage eventually üòä
---
Ok.
---
Lol.
---
Something something something pAy tO wIn
---
Well, it will be when we strap a laser to its head....
---
When the drugs (or Nukashine) wears off and it's 3am and you don't know what happened...
---
To expand, it didn‚Äôt until like patch 8 or so. So google may be giving you results from old gameplay.
---
After I finish one of the events that gives them, I immediately forget about them and then a few days later at a workbench I realize "oh, I still have these weighing me down, I should stash them next time I go to my camp"
---
No sporran, but there is a kilt.  It kinda loops up a ways over your shoulders, not quite authentic.  And tartan is too tough on the graphics, so they had to make it one color.  They chose red.  
---
It's got a funny name though, can't remember just off the top of my head...
---
I had like 10 cores I made, then I kept reloading and each one had like 1 or 2 shots and now I‚Äôm down to like 1 core.
---
Good for you. And generally, I feel the same way, I _choose_ not to go back for it, and I _choose_ not to get upset if something disappears. 
---
Just like I _choose_ not to rage quit when the bag just _never shows up_. 
---
But that doesn't mean I shouldn't have the _fucking option_ to take it back from a thief if I decide to do so. Would I ever use it? Maybe, maybe not. But it should be there. There should be consequences for the vultures in this game who stand there as you're trying to get help to resurrect and then steal your shit as you're dying.
---
EDIT: and...flux goes for 100+ per, all day every day in vending machines. They ARE worth that. They are, by definition, worth what people will pay for them. I don't get that objection at all.
---
Best to keep some padding and never hit max.  Personally I buy plans whenever I'm close to max caps and I try to consider \~24k my "max" so I have room in case someone buys a ton of crap from my store.  Still wind up getting wasted caps at max but whatever, caps are kind of meaningless once you are capped out anyway :P
---
But how often do you run into other players? Also can you play non survival and level up your character or gather supplies first?
---
No. Repair kits regardless of free or from events, you cannot sell, trade or drop.
---
would it really tho? look at the practical side. This isn't charity work. This game needs $$$ to develop some of the hundreds of things just this sub has suggested. I can't imagine Fo76 is making ANY money for Bethesda right now. If they asked you to come out of pocket for something valuable to you in-game I don't see that as a crime or evil. You could always not buy the things. 
---
I get it. I don't love pay to win either but this game needs to find a way to generate revenue. Occam's razor. 
---
In very stark contrast to my comment, this game needs a FREE WEEKEND or a friend discount to get your friends in for super cheap to try it out. Pad out these player numbers. I find it especially baron on PC some days. Need an influx of new players to possibly buy atoms for the atom fueled ammo converter or the post-apocalyptic fridges.
---
Just last night I killed a legendary super mutant at robco (clearly did NOT kill a legendary robot) and as i'm casually looking thru it's body for loot it explodes on me. Dafuq
---
I'm still level 26, so I won't be able to craft that one for a while.
---
Got mine from Amazon and it came with a code printed on a CD-shaped piece of cardboard. Very bare bones case materials.
---
I know the issue been mentioned before, but great level of detail on this.  You've made it specific and testable, that's what we need to be providing in our feedback.
---
I was able to do the sheepsquatch event once and got a revive from it on my main character, the above story is from my alt I'm leveling up for a bloodied heavy weapons build.  All kinds of helpful people getting revives at that event, just keep doing it and you'll get it.
---
I renamed all my guns. That would suck.
---
Oh no question, this game has it's own...pile of problems that are unique to this "new" realm for this publisher. But people who look at this game and are _shocked_ that things aren't fixed instead of simply _disappointed_ that they aren't fixed amuse me. 
---
I want shit to work better. I loathe a lot of these bugs, but I also recognize the sheer, mind-numbing incompetence or lack of care that has come from this developer for the quality of their games, based on everything else they've ever published.
---
Pc
---
The stairs with the posts and wire floors do not stack.
---
I think it's just how you build your character. I can kill a basic 50 SB with 4 missiles from a bloodied missile launcher.
---
Battle royal mode. Hope not though
---
Holy shiiiiit. Hi. I thought I was the ONLY person who was very interested in PVP open world fallout within the community. My heart sank pre-release when I saw fans bashing the hell out of fallout having PVP elements. I knew it was doomed then.
---
I'm certainly not the first to think of it but I'm planning out a John Wick build for my next character. It's a modified stealth commando to use auto pistols and a combat or bowie knife (if only there were a pencil weapon). It will be a bloodied, VATS heavy build with Gun Fu and other perks to get reliable damage numbers. I may tweak things to get more points in Adrenaline because that feels appropriate.
---
Here's my current [plan.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=b6345de&amp;d=s50si0sj0ss2sg2p02pb2eh2c72ab0af0ai0a71a80ar1ao0a32a00la2l71lt2lk2ic4s01l12&amp;w=&amp;n=John%20Wick&amp;m=125cf)
---
3 to 5 K
---
Yes but with post-war materials metals that were salvaged and scrapped not fresh forge not and you're not understanding that they don't have the materials that they used to. Yes the XO one in the ultracite are stronger because they were created later. but because of the materials used it would be easy to get a sword in there that's why you see Raiders running around with swords that's why you sea Raiders in power armor with pipe weapons.
---
Value: 0c
---
Yet another thing ruined by duping.
---
Isnt it rare ?
---
Yeah I totally forgot about that, was in the moment and just really psyched to have someone willing to just keel over for me.  I'll eventually get that I'm sure, more concerned with unlocking the backpack that grabbing all the badges yet.
---
Because it scraps all.
---
Im happy i got it atleast lol
---
Gatling gun in PvP? Oh hell no. Gatling gun in PvE? As a HW player, It‚Äôs my sniper and my everyday trash mob killer. Crazy accurate, very ammo and repair efficient, and as a bloodied HW PA user, my instigating 25% fire rate Gatling with speedy receiver is just perfect. Once Adrenaline stacks up to/past 50%, it oneshots max level supermutants, and with speedy+fire rate, it feels like a good firing speed. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt have the raw DPS, but the accuracy and single-shot efficiency make it fill it‚Äôs role perfectly. I still use a 1star bloodied primed 50cal for big enemies or hordes of fast movers (ghouls) because the raw firepower is unbeatable.
---
The only other HW gun in the running for me is an LMG, but keeping it fed with ammo is just too annoying. Ignoring reloads, it‚Äôs DPS is higher than a 50cal; I haven‚Äôt bothered with math including reloads. I carry a vampire‚Äôs LMG for fast health regen.
---
The South literally started the war you dumb fuck.
---
Slavery is bad, you lost, deal with it.
---
yep, 6 perk ranks (just rank 1 in each rifle and pistol perk) = +60% damage which normally takes 9 ranks.
---
You can go apeshit and take 18 ranks (9 in both pistols and rifles) and get +120%damage.  That's a HUGE investment and would kind of gimp the rest of the build but holy crap man you'd deal a fuckton of damage...
---
What platform?
---
Not anymore. It was literally the rarest item in the entire game until another dupe method came out... now it's all over
---
I half considered stacking stairs on top of each other to make a tower up to a killable height so you could do that anywhere.
---
Ditto.
---
Could have emailed me the code and would have had an identical install experience.
---
Yup, maxed rifleman get you to 160 HP w/o any mods. 
---
That's more than the lever action rifle or the Hunting rifle.
---
See the Munitions Factory for just this scenario. Although post nerf it isn‚Äôt giving what it used to.
---
All over? I am yet to see it
---
One of these days I want to test how much of an impact it actually amounts to. Run a timer Full health to death in x-01, then same in t-51b.
---
I have done a tiny bit of PVP on my heavy character. I was two shoting a dude with my AAE Gatling gun. I even managed to one shot him with a critical hit, which should be impossible. It was surprising.
---
What platform are you? If PC the person who replied above may be able to help and if XBox I'm game if you reciprocate?
---
Yea as far as I can tell you characters are the same in either mode; item wise. 
---
How often do you see other players? ummm I didn't have trouble finding other players to fight or make sweet love to. But I image that will vary greatly based on a number of things in any given session.
---
That seems like a good idea! I was in the middle of a fight last night when someone went to my camp and started buying loads of heavier priced items. I quickly hit 24.5K and was trying to get to my camp to kill the power to my vendors when someone bought a 3.5K item. Wasn‚Äôt quick enough to stop it, and I‚Äôm pretty frustrated to have lost out on the sale. I wish there was a settings option, or something of the sort, to enable and disable your vendors without having to manually go to your base and shut off the power.
---
Agreed. I farm a lot myself and some servers are just super hot. First thing I do is clear whitesprings, check safe and clean if it looks good I move on to West tek ... still good then it's time for the antique store, nar and flooded trainyards in the bog. By that time everything should be reset and you can start all over. If whitesprings isn't dropping I server hop till it does.
---
It is more or less confirmed in the latest [Inside the Vault](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5Ri0eXAqfcYRC8dLq3qKk5/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-wild-appalachia-concludes):
---
&gt; As mentioned in the 2019 Roadmap, we‚Äôre planning to roll out a new game mode with Nuclear Winter, send intrepid explorers into Vaults 94 and 96, and make major changes to the main questline with Wastelanders.
---
&gt;
---
&gt; We‚Äôre excited to continue this journey with you, and we can‚Äôt wait to share more details about what we have in store for Appalachia and the Fallout 76 community during our fifth annual Bethesda E3 Showcase.
---
Pay To Win
---
I sure hope so. I'd love to get a brotherhood backpack
---
See... the problem there is that I can kill a level 80 SB with less than a second of sustained fire from my bloodied .50 cal, and maybe 5-6 shots from my BE gatling gun. So why would I ever use a missile launcher which fires slower, breaks easily, and has very heavy ammo?
---
I have no problem with limited PVP but No PVP is just ridiculous. Fallout isn't a utopia. We have the Pitt to the North and the Capital Wasteland to our East this shouldn't be close to a paradise.
---
And the toxic behavior to the raider community is just immature. We are supposed to be the Toxic cruel ones.
---
When they first started appearing, people were asking $70 RL for them. Then as it continued, I've seen them in vending for 750c. 
---
As irked as I was by the rare mask drop rate at the Fasnacht event? Them being duped and monetized ruined the whole thing for me. At least I haven't seen any sun or jester masks.
---
I see it EVERYWHERE on xbox.
---
FYI, tagging people in a text post doesn't do anything. You have to tag them in a comment for them to get notified. And even then, you can't tag more than 3 in one comment, or none of them will get the notification.
---
This would be fun in encryptid or other events where people tend to die a lot :)
---
Code.
---
Seeing a ton of them on Xbox.
---
Don't draw attention to the railway bro, it's one of the last good guns. Do you want Nerfthesda to ruin for all of us?
---
They have been. Id you‚Äôve been playing for a long time and paid attention to patch notes, there‚Äôs been a bunch of fixes for things we complain about. 
---
The problem is there are a LOT of bugs, and each patch fixes some and makes some other new ones. 3 steps forward 2 steps back, basically.
---
&gt;bulked junk does weigh less
---
[Actually, in most cases, it doesn't](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cH0AdM1waoEGxA0IRcAsuGtSyOk05COWopSbEsfZDds/edit).
---
TLDR: only bulked aluminum and lead weight less.
---
I think the caps limit need to go, but they can put other limits to make this work.
---
Maybe they can limit the daily amount of caps that can be spent or received through personal trading to 25k. 
---
This way, if people want to do more trades they will have to use vending machines which take 10% as tax.
---
I guess I'd say stay away from people with low health.
---
Dammit...
---
Right. Ever server is different lol. I‚Äôll try to level up and get some gear first before I got into survival lol
---
I was able to score 80 fragrant venison despite dying twice.
---
Granted I punch for 800+ dmg and fly around the biome.
---
Getting rank 3 by yourself is possible if you are fast, but your character likely won't be spec'd to tank the alpha.
---
The best way to remedy these group-centric events is to implement a radio station to serve as a lobby, just like Hunter/Hunted.
---
PvP in adventure is currently exactly how it need to be as far as rules of engagement.
---
True  
---
IIRC, the first part of Rose is in the forest.  I had already learned (the hard way) about roaming parts of the Divide.  But most of the western edge of the divide scales, so if there's no high levels around, path of the wind and the top of the world proper have low level enemies.  
---
But the other areas Rose takes you....that's one reason why I had the quest for 20+ levels before completing it.   The other was to get the higher level reward.
---
Actually, I think at least one step of each of the named quests will take you to scaled enemy locations.
---
Because why not it's fun using different things.  Besides I like to blow stuff up that's the main reason I run dense and fireproof.  I like to suicide run stuff with a bloodied mirv fatman and still live. But on another note what are you running that u can kill a SB that quick with a .50 cal.  It takes me a good min to take it down with my BE minigun while it's flying
---
It doesn't seem to work in a normal wall but it worked for me last night in a door frame for a powered door which was great.  Mind you this was after building for 5 hours straight with 2 of those hours laying down conduits.
---
Has anyone had any luck with the conduit radiator things?  I think they're supposed to distribute power through the floor/wall but it seems to do nothing which is annoying the hell out of me.
---
Nuka grenades and auto grenade launcher are better since they take much less weight, try them.
---
This. Very silly it does not set a marker for it though.
---
I would like to see a single player, not solo player option. I am not much into MMO's and while I am trying to like 76, it is just not what I like. A single player game set up just like this without all the gimmick MMO stuff would be pretty good. An offline single player mode would also be great. We will more than likely get some battle royale game mode, sigh. 
---
Though it will not happen some ES 6 news would be good for us single player only gamer types. I am just mostly confused with the content released for 76 so far, that is mostly just me, I just do not get what they are trying to do. There is no way to complete the overseers quest, which is kind of the main story so I am not sure why they included it. The rest of the stuff is just kind of meh... to what? I am glad people seem to like it, just not my kind of game. But some single player, not solo player stuff would be great.
---
It's a known bug that Betheada wont fix for some reason.
---
It took me several hours, but with trial and error I got my house wired properly. I used those long pipes along the floor or along the ceiling, hides pretty well and no hanging wires. The pass through wall conduit is hiding in a corner with a piece of furniture blocking it.
---
Back out of the building menu, to game, then try again.
---
Works 90% of the time for me.
---
Let it be a lesson to you... Stop traveling with so much junk on you.
---
If I come upon a bag filled with a smattering of random junk, I'll leave it be.
---
If I see a ton of steel/lead/etc that shit is as good as mine...
---
I agree and this could help out many players online.
---
This would also allow vending machines to be used more when others need stuff.
---
I am on Xbox, GT dashsixteen
---
If you have a good automatic pistol paired with concentrated fire and other vats stuff this can be a pretty good vats build.
---
Hoping they blow the map wide open... wanna see what's west and north, please.
---
Never done an official test but I notice a difference in how often I have oh sh*t moments.  It isnt just the rads it's the creatures, especially ghouls.  They do radiation damage on top of whatever environment you are experiencing.  Plus I run bloodied so I run hot already at 50% rads at least.  If I am in my t51 I have those "I'm gunna die, I'm gunna die..." moments constantly, x01 very rarely.
---
It has one of the lowest DPS of the heavy guns class (excluding joke weapons like broadsider and harpoon) but it hits pretty hard and has incredible ammo conservation making it good for trash clearing.
---
So much crying over "pay to win" from delicate wasteland flowers.
---
Joking aside, they're following the tenet of only cosmetic only items offered in the Atom shop. I'd like it better if it would have been a gasmask skin. Could have solved the problem, and still offered it.
---
You on now? If not ping me when you are ill drop on.

It gave me the most fun in Runescape which cleary was a pve game too. Its more fun than have those two seperate modes. They will not work. I bet they will not continue the survival mode so you have to unite it and the best way to do so is having zones. In the best case they do it with an dlc and increase the whole map by far. I believe that would be the best for his game + extend the player limit to 30-40 than.
---
this guy gets it! if its not a hot server i also just jump
---
Nope, at work right now.  I'm usually on around 10PM Pacific time.
---
It takes my CAMP a full 2-4 minutes to load. Last time I was loosing health because I couldn't see whatever it was attacking me. Had to find a building to jump on and wait it out.
---
The only thing that fixes it for me is to add more foundations to the chunk that is giving the error then from the end delete until you get to the foundation you know is secure and placed according to the editor .. it's a huge pain .. and when the editor says "Nothing is selected" that is some kind of interface error I guess but exiting out of the editor and jumping back seems to fix it.
---
Yep only real noobs measure items‚Äô values by counting stars.
---
Claim every workshop you can even if you don't intend to keep them, it's easy quick experience. Use your XP boost buffs (well rested, Cranberry products, etc.). Visit nuke zones as soon as you are able to
---
If any of those were glowing variants I'd wager that's the reason. I ran into the same problem with last week's challenge in the Ash Heap. Annoying as fuck.
---
reinstall windows
---
One of many reasons I've never bothered with that place.
---
The buildouts linked in this thread are a pretty good starting point.
---
In general, I would look for these options in a good rifle/stealth build...
---
1. Bandolier (2)
---
2. Rifleman (9), and Comando (9)
---
3. Tank Killer (3)
---
4. Concentrated Fire (at least one, 3 if you can)
---
5. Covert Operative (3)
---
6. Sneak (3)
---
7. Bloody Mess (3)
---
I run Intelligence a little higher for Nerd Rage (3), but low health isn't for everybody.  Escape Artist, Adrenaline and Tormentor are worthy picks as well.
---
There is an argument that multiple pieces of Chameleon will stack for more invisibilty; others call BS...might test that for yourself.  Shadowed armor, too.  Otherwise, higher agility means higher sneak.
---
I've run WesTek, successfully,  with a non-legendary lever action using this build.  Don't think you need an explosive rifle to get things done.  Top teir legendary weapons can be fun, but aren't mandatory.
---
My favorite rifles so far (in no order), Bloodied Handmade w/perforating mag, Anti Armor Handmade w/perf mag, and Instigating Lever Action.
---
I thought I saw that this was confirmed via a YouTube video referencing data mining.
---
I have bad luck on PS4, everytime I go do the event there's only 3 or 4 people attending and no one wants to feed the troughs or protect the friendly. I've won 1 time in 8. Only got junk.
---
I asked someone on mic to kindly jump from their cliffside CAMP a few times. She did, it was fab.
---
I've seen several comments about battle Royale ... Hopefully and they don't do that since I don't play those types of games.
---
I don't use them because I found the team based nature of the missions too much of a hassle to go through. Also , I get distracted by other things each time I start making headway. Still been trying to get in a full team for Arktos... if I notice the event is starting at all..
---
Wooohh! So the state of this game won't be West Virginia anymore?
---
Idk lol that's funny though. Maybe you can request an unban
---
I just bought this game yesterday and I'm having a good time even though I'm playing by myself. It feels a little lonely since people just ignore me :u
---
Probably linked, something got reset I guess, I've no clue about coding so I bet it's super complicated and hard to fix everything.
---
Anyone on ps4 willing to die for me? I‚Äôll die for you :)
---
That's about 6am my time (BST) :P
---
I'll probably be on about an hour or two later than that so will check if you are still online and message you. Adding you as a friend now so I can see.
---
So I was lucky, as that's the first one I got....
---
Saw it was in the list along with some other BoS stuff....read the plan.
---
Then a couple days later when I tried to build it....not in the craftable list and the plan is gone from my inventory (not listed as (known), not listed as Plan:
---
Maybe it went the same places as the 15 odd pieces of tech data I had on hand when I turned in the first marked by the quest diamond piece....
---
Now I'm concerned about the 2 T60 paints I know I got, as well.  
---
Looks like I know what I'll be doing when I get home from work :)
---
Mountain mama, take me home
---
Xbox
---
Just use a different email and create a new Bethesda account to start over.
---
I thought it was funny as shit when I got banned..... But now id really like to play it XD and I screwed myself there.
---
Still in the blast zone though.
---
Get another account, buy a new copy
---
Yea put up a lfg on xbox and you will get one quick if you want to buy one.
---
Can take a little longer if it's far away, but that's due to being out of range. I don't bother if it's that far away.
---
Kentucky, Ohio, and Pennsylvania
---
Fine, fuck it, lets sit down and not cherry pick your fucking numbers
---
Fallout 76 has a higher play count then ESO, an extremely popular MMORPG with constant updates and no issues in player counts.
---
Fallout 76 has a higher player count then Warframe, *a free* to play MMORPg with an extremely large player base and no issues at all in player counts.
---
Fallout 76, a total failure, an unplayable flop, a dead game with a dying community of just a few thousand, out does two of the most successful and popular MMOs on the market right now, one *free to play*. It didn't sell like the best thing ever made, no one is going to deny that, but it *has*, a large player base, it has a *engaged* player base. 
---
ESO has about 25K concurrent players according to Steam Charts and those numbers are unreliably *low* and Bethesda never has released or made public any kind of official player counts, but they *have* made public that ESO has a fairly even 33/33/33 split between all three major platforms in terms of purchases. So it's almost certain Fallout 76 surpasses those numbers by at least a few thousand, possibly over 10 thousand or *more*. And that's just *concurrent*, at any given time, that doesn't account in anyway for *total* player base, the number of people who log in for a few hours every week, or plan to come back in a few months, or any number of massive variables.
---
So lets review. You're completely wrong about sales numbers, you back pedaled on steamcharts already, you've ignored the games that don't line up with your ideas and you've still not bothered to post a link that isn't a reddit post about the game selling for cheap. I have proved my point, because I have bothered to post *proof*. 
---
And yes, this is me trying to get the last word in and yes I'm being as petty as you are obviously, but at least it's better to be petty and *right*
---
After a few restarts of the game everything has returned to the Collections list.
---
I need to learn develop more patience.
---
Ammo factory is worth it  for more than just defending it
---
They are already sellouts so I wouldn't be suprised.
---
I've been blessed with RNG lately and found that there might be a pattern for unlocking the power armor skins. I got the BoS Knight T-60 paint a few days ago (I played until level 120 since launch with no exploits and recently came back from a 4 month break) and today got the BoS Knight Captain paint. Perhaps there is an order for the ranks of paint you have a chance to unlock? I'm not sure what the highest rank power armor BoS paint is available in Fo76.
---
FYI: I have turned in HUNDREDS of technical data, so keep at it guys.
---
I thought of that but I felt like i probably have cheated the system enough XD.
---
I hope they drop a bugfix or two before E3...
---
"EU" Laws. A bunch of bullshit programs built to tax and slap the shit out of everyone with fines to grow revenue?
---
Dude secondly thanks for offering at least a solution. Never seen a console game offering an in game texting function. If this guy finds other people to play with who are deaf and wants to text one another just use Discord or any third-party app. Other than the initial organization of this it would be very simple.
---
I haven't actually heard of them unbanning people for second chances, but you can say I did the crime I did the time and now I wanna play again. Maybe offer them some sweet deals like you'll buy some atoms üòÇ
---
Yes, Codsworth for everyone!
---
Yeah I have to make a mental note immediate after bulking.
---
Go straight to Sutton Station, thinking to myself **"do NOT touch the crafting table, sell your crap."**
---
\*Oh look a radroach\*
---
\*What was I doing again? Oh some adhesive\*
---
\*Better break down this junk\*
---
\*Why do I have soo much... ah fack! NOT AGAIN!\*
---
They need to fix duping forever, nerf the pvp gear, balance weapons/armor so average players stand a chance, introduce the next tier of gear to make duped stuff useless, seperate solo players from groups, then maybe it will catch on.
---
I don't think they can/will honestly.
---
I like my account. XD
---
The game is still young. They probably are saving them for the major launches. Don't ask for everything right away. Also I can see them adding 4 star then waiting a while for the 5 star
---
congrats!
---
Seems like it. Probably since they fixed server hopping for checking containers unless if you pass your daily reset
---
There will always be someone out there who wants an online game to be solo so they can be by themselves. Thing is, would that be one server for just one player? That would be a bad move.
---
In my opinion the way this game is made is really good and it helps make it even more unique.
---
Don't worry you will meet others. Are you on PC? IGN: Crimsunwolfxiii
---
They better not wait to long. Save the content for too long and you wont have a playerbase to use it. Other games come out all the time.
---
You can go to a fissure site at the northern end of the cranberry bog and there's 2 corpses of mega sloths. They work.
---
Projectile speed and server lag makes it really hard to hit enemies for me.
---
On?
---
I had the same issues when I started doing this event. I then did it solo a few times to learn the map and figure out which biome I could get to 40 in time. Yesterday I solo‚Äôd it by shutting down the robots and focusing on biome B. Stunned the grafton monster with my cryolator and beat him to death with my bloodied mole miner gauntlet. It wasn‚Äôt easy but very manageable with that cryolator
---
Probably just a pre-recorded message where the devs thank the community, and then a trailer for Nuclear Winter and a shorter teaser for Wastelanders. Kinda like how the second wave of DLC for Fallout 4 was announced. 76 isn't Bethesda's main event at this E3, so I don't think they'll spend a lot of time on it.
---
your opinion
---
No Jetpack for Ultracite or Excavator, 
---
Ultracite has the highest Ballistic DR
---
X-01 Has the highest Energy &amp; Rad resistance
---
T-60 is a good balance between them, and has the most available mods of any PA, and is the cheapest to repair/maintain (Doesn't require any Screws, Springs, or exotic materials, just Steel, Aluminum, &amp; Plastic).
---
&gt;...change the pipboy UI color in the INI files 
---
You mean like this?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9uixqm/found_where_to_edit_pipboy_and_interface_colours/
---
It also changes your pip-boy flashlight, so I changed my all of my RGB to 1.0  for the brightest white possible!
---
EDIT: Changed 255 to 1.0. Sorry, it's been a while
---
You can hack robots bit I don't know to what purpose.
---
I didnt put an opinion in. Never put my personal feelings about anything here.
---
I have a level 1 bloodied hunting rifle, I use it to one-shot everything when I‚Äôm building my 2nd character, it‚Äôs just incredibly efficient.
---
Yeah I know. Actually when we did it, my buddy said no one is going to believe this. That's ok we'll do it again but I'll record it. It's possible with only 2 people there. One take hab C and the other takes B. You leave A alone, don't kill the robots there. Defend B and C- the robots take out the trash in A and the level 0 tick will live. The alpha is then crippled and solo in whatever hab he pops into.
---
Right?! I pulled a BE from a player vendor for 1500. I had the auto plans apparently,  and I must have learned the long barrel somewhere. Just need a better stock. 
---
Omg this thing is a vats beast!!! I can get a crit every clip, like every 5 seconds. Super long range!! How did I get to lvl 150 before discovering this??
---
Not sure why so many downvotes, helpful response to teach how to check yourself. Reddit is savage today.
---
I agree. It's stupid. It's a holdover from a poorly implemented pvp system. As for the folks saying that it adds tension or whatever garbage excuse, go shuffle off to Survival mode and fight for your loot instead of being a low effort parasite.
---
Don't rush the game or people will be bored and leave
---
Did it end happily?
---
I had 58,use 999 ammo, new core loaded, 58 left. Which i want to really test cause I know for a fact fusion cores have more juice in them than is used for ammo (weird why not) and i had like 3-5 low cores equipped at a time. So if it means primed ultracite gatling can combine them i am never going back from my green laser.
---
Well so far you have have been the most constructively helpful.
---
So if it were true RNG, what would you say the odds are that I'd get 3-4 items with the same legendary effect from consecutive enemies on four separate occasions over the past month. That would be an infinitesimally small chance, right?
---
There has to be some kind of seeding system being used.
---
Like they have been for months already?
---
Well now.... that explains why my excavator is now listed with a DR of 36....
---
Why does everyone have this problem? Simply put your bulked scrap into your stash when you're done bulking it.
---
I play solo, so I cannot have input on group loot rolls, only my own because of that
---
We should be able to "favorite" junk or something to prevent scrapping. I want those goddamned bloatfly glands to stay where they are.
---
And yet... here we are. With people still playing the original StarCraft, a few years into ESO, WoW is still going...
---
This gun is designed for vats. I don't even bother to use it without vats.
---
I hope the new game mode is a true hardcore mode full of radiation and high level scary creatures everywhere, instead of battle royale
---
Video is in my PSN-Profile media watch it 12minutes.Myyramakoljonen is my PSN-name. and its in my Youtube channel Bloodied Sealboy if interested
---
Jebs log one, I just got out of the vault and it doesn't look too good, already there is a guy in power armor pointing a shotgun at my chest (Shotgun blast and a small explosion)
---
The way I look at it, if it's got a valuable * plus others that aren't garbage, it'll sell. Someone is looking for it.
---
Pretty sure the meat hook is a "lower tier" unarmed weapon. In my experience, the deathclaw gauntlet does more damage.
---
The problem for me is even with vats I can't hit anything....
---
That's explained in the game though.
---
You can only use the pass through conduit from one side of the wall for some silly reason. The little conduit nub has to be on the exterior surface side. The two pipe ends have to be on the interior surface side of the wall. It's silly. Try turning it around and trying to pass it through. From there, you can rig connectors and /or conduit pipe to get the power going.
---
I have a fully enclosed generator and I run power through two pass through wall conduits and through another conduit that passes through the floor above to the top level.
---
Hahaha it‚Äôs been half a year and they still haven‚Äôt fixed it? I got tired of bugs, quit and bought RDR2 lol. Haven‚Äôt looked back!
---
Had it with aid items, but is gone now and can't replicate it with your method.
---
Maybe you have different equipment/perks?
---
Not any more than the underarmors do.
---
I got the beaver by taking a photo of the dead one in the lab at the ranger station in Cranberry Bog. Might try that one if the other photos aren't registering.
---
BBQ joint
---
I think if you keep your store stocked with reasonably priced items, you won't miss the little bit you lost, it will be replaced easily enough.
---
I shut my store down *before* I would go over by selling the highest price item I have up (which I did after I lost a bit to the cap too).  That does mean that my best items are rarely ever in the ship though.  I've spent down a little with plans a couple times, but I'm shopping for something pretty spendy, so I want to have plenty on hand - it's killing my income, but there's no rush really.
---
The only guns I use solely for vats is my aae 10mm pistol with -25% ap consumption and FE Pipe pistol.
---
I use concentrated fire to aim at the head and with auto fire they kill everything.
---
Ahhh, so more spawns  will come according to level?
---
Or you can use the overlay on PC, default Shift + ~
---
Fred‚Äôs bbq shack? I think that‚Äôs the name of the place. It‚Äôs where the free range event starts near top of the world.
---
The BBQ place *always* has a few foxes
---
I wish I could solo this.....I'm not that good or outfitted well enough.
---
I always have a ton of antibiotics on me and clear anything I catch straight away, I don't think most cause me an issue I just get annoyed by the constant messages at the top.
---
&gt;(please stay out with your "It was actually the War of Northern Aggression" garbage. There are other places for that.)
---
yeah, the garbage bin of history, lol
---
I have a ve auto and it melted the alpha at arktos...plus with so trigger control you can get off single shot...plus really cheap ammo crafting requirements..and the ammo is recoverable! ( She does kick like hell though).
---
Maybe just ask if you can play it on your account with a new purchase.
---
I play mostly survival so I just unhook the power lead to my vendor.
---
Not in game yet.
---
My (disgusting) sister left a coolant bottle on the ground by my fence. Bright green. Every time I see it I think 'oh plastic!'
---
Hell I'd be okay with a 25% return. Just something to get rid of ammo I don't need. Especially missiles.
---
Oh sadly I'm on PS4 , don't have my PC ATM since I'm traveling :'(
---
I don't think it's in-game yet.
---
I would love to see the map expand even more. This could open up even more content for us to do. Also, I feel that if a player hasn't completed the main quest, then they should stay on servers that we have right now while the rest of us hop on to a bigger map. 
---
Maybe have it where you complete some quest and have the map grow over time to reveal new areas to enter into. I have confidence that Bethesda could do this since they have ESO with a growing map system with each new update and dlc. If players manage to progress enough, so does time and the same with enemies and bosses going away.
---
Once the scorchbeast queen is defeated, then the players won't deal with the scorch as much but it will be remnants of them as they thin out.
---
I seen the guy who has it on PC. Remember seeing a pic of him during fach event and it's the same guy. Burned him up in my trap and he roid raged though. Haven't seen dupes in the vendors, maybe xbox.
---
Hey FarPlace,  I could use it. I'll toss you a friend invite tonight when I get home from work. Same IGN
---
Yes, they will continue to spawn until the boss is killed. The newly spawned enemies will sack to your level if they can. For example a mole miner cannot spawn above level 40 as far as I know.
---
I wasn‚Äôt for 800+hrs. Then I discovered unyielding gear and bloodied weapons, and the right perks, and the game hasn‚Äôt been the same ever since
---
They need to relax the rules and be way more liberal with clipping.
---
Here's mine.  
---
1. Wires!!!  Whoever did "QA" on wiring in this game needs to be fired - it's the most pathetic job of QA I've ever seen, and it's what I do for a living. Wiring objects is buggy and frustrating as hell.
---
2. I don't care if I make an area accessible. Remove that check and I bet a ton of bugs will go away.
---
3. Never made something green that can't be legally placed Seriously, it's annoying.
---
4. Give us more prebuild options. This will help cut the object count down. For example, 2x1, 2x2 and 3x3 foundations.
---
5. To be honest, I'd prefer just dropping all code that checks to see if objects are "supported"  It isn't working anway and just gets in the way. Players who want to build life like structures will do so. Players who want to build gravity defying garbage are also going to do so whether there are rules in place or not.
---
But I will say, I always do my part. I never leave the side of the friendly when the boss pops up. I can get legendaries elsewhere. I want the new plans and backpack most.
---
Because people running explosive heavy weapons are usually in power armor for the Stabilized benefits, and there is no Dense Torso for power armor.
---
Doesn‚Äôt work in the Forrest for sure or toxic valley for sure :(
---
I hope we can build upper floors directly without any stairs.
---
I mean most of us Fallout players don't care about a battle Royale so I it wouldn't make sense to put it :(
---
I know there aren't 'good servers' and 'bad servers' and that every server is running off the same RNG and loot tables, but I do know for sure that I've seen people get several god drops in a row, and then go to the Purveyor and get more of the same. I also know some servers are straight dog shit, from personal experience.
---
What I'm saying is, can someone have this 'god drop' scenario happen and then make a forum post for others to come and play the, assumingly, better than regular odds at a good weapon? If so, we need to help each other out. 
---
Side note: This post was inspired from my experience last night where I server hopped 5 or 6 times looking for a 'good server' until I got a Bloodied and a AA firearm drop right in a row. I went to the Purveyor to spend my 900 scrip and ended up with 2 ghoul slayers, 2 mutant slayers, and some other useless weapons. I know the theoretical methodology for maximizing your rolls, but I have yet for it to actually pay off. Yet, I continue to hear tales, see videos, and read posts of people getting 2 or 3 god roll items off the same server, using these strategies.
---
Almost certainly
---
God this just isn't the place y'all
---
You kind of need it. It creates some tension that can be fun. I'll get my score up and then go someplace cool like Flat Woods and wait for the hunters. 
---
The map is so large natural interactions are rare. I have had less than 5 natural encounters in a few hundred hours on survival.
---
Do I've had to do a workaround, basically create a brand new pathway way that doesn't connect at all to any of the pieces in that area and have it connect to the bad piece. Usually it let's me store the bad piece, but sometimes I just replace my camp. Lol
---
I'm rifle spec'ed. I've thought about switching things up.
---
I have a forest scout leg with 50% reduced fall damage. Got it on my first 3 star armor roll from the purveyor.
---
I would kill for a classy backpack to pair with formal wear.
---
I have, but eventually I figured out it was my own lack of attention that was to blame.  That was from dropping items without realizing it (easier to do than you think).
---
I haven't lost pieces that I *KNOW* were in my stash, or bits of PA gear out of a set, those reports have me worried a bit.  But my disappearing All Rise?  Yeah, pretty darn sure that ended up on the floor somewhere.
---
Let us grow more plants. Cranberries, pumpkins..
---
You can get into power armor and measure it exactly with the health bar on the hud.  Just collect dirty water to gain +1 rad when you get close.  Then note what your current hp level is in your pip boy
---
No idea but I can say that some servers are stupid lopsided. 
---
On Monday, the first server I had spawned 8 legendaries in the White Springs Resort (1 3\*, 7 1\*) and then 4 3\* for Uranium Fever. 
---
Then, the entire server (16+ people) did 6 back-to-back SBQ runs which I personally got at least 50 legendaries from (only 4 3\*s though). 
---
When I got back on, later that day, I didn't get shit from a Whitesprings run, a burrows run, and one SQB run besides 3 1\*s and one 2\* (all crap).
---
Someone said you can in another Reddit post, I read so many yesterday. Maybe he was trolling? Or maybe there is another side mission to get it...
---
So I deal with this almost every time my wife and I play.  Then again if either of us gets disconnected, etc.
---
I found the best thing to do when its being a pain, is for everyone go to the social menu/teams and make sure they drop team if they are in one.  It gets in this weird state where it thinks you are in a team, but not all the way or something.
---
Once everyone is out of the team, at least ONE person in the group should be able to invite the others, then that person can make whoever leader.
---
If neither of these things work, logging out to menu, then logging back in should do the trick.
---
Well, I did a "Tank Girl" character: All pipe weapons and raider armour, wore the ratty dress and the army helmet. Nothing really special about her though, and gave up.
---
Had a "junkie" character that was fun as a distraction at low levels. Consumed all drugs immediately on finding them, would trade for chems regardless of whether or not it was a "fair" trade. 
---
My "Mad Doc" is a ton of fun. All energy weapons all the time. Mod all weapons to the most "tech-y" mod available, even if it's not the "best" mod. Scrap or sell all low-tech items. High INT and CHA for group heals and "medic" class stuff.
---
Have a Ghoul character. All END... with some into AGI, right now. (Still super low level). Plan is to make him as "self sufficient" as possible... low food and water requirements, low chance of disease, low rads, etc... basically, gonna try to remove his reliance on "survival mechanics" as much as possible, just to see if I can do it. Keep him super mobile... sleeping bag, stash box, campfire. That's it.
---
I only added it because I saw someone saying you can get it in another thread.
---
I asked players until someone agreed, gave him 2k caps afterwards, we were both happy
---
Yes, that's clumpy RNG with weighted reward values.
---
When flipping a coin HTHTHTHT is suspicious if it occurs too frequently.
---
https://youtu.be/tP-Ipsat90c
---
Like cranberries and silt beans and snaptail reeds and bloodleaf and such?
---
I like the foxes they are cute.
---
Nope. Dupers destroyed it as fast as it was released.
---
*As the player builds their Camp they hear their robot say...*
---
"Just know that my sensors indicate that you have dangerously low levels of class for this establishment."
---
Use power armor then look at your pipboy to see how much hp you have at 20% and remember it
---
I like how you post this in an ACTIVE Fallout 76 subreddit which has 10s of thousands of ACTIVE people who play the game. Makes me question why you‚Äôre even posting this even though you don‚Äôt like the game.
---
Yes, talk to him until he gives you the quest, if it doesn't work, join another server or do something else then return. (it's kinda buggy sometimes)
---
Mixing up your armor is the only way to go in this game...x-01 head and arms for a bit of radiation boost, t51b torso for extra armor (plus, before the patch that let you buy x01 mod plans, mods..) t-60 legs for the cheapest repair in the game on the most frequently destroyed part.
---
What sorcery is this? I thought my +75 was legit.
---
Why stay below 20% lol I never understood this logic.
---
It's really a daily? I thought you could do it several times per 24h
---
Yes that would work but I rarely wear PA any more and hate the entry exit animation, it has become a pet peeve. But yes, that would work.
---
Ditto. Crashed out after a imposter sheepsqatch fight when I tried to eat some meats. Have crashed out while drinking alcohol for daily challenges as well.
---
Mine is a mansion that sits on top of the Ridge, no problem.
---
Not in game yet, as far as I know. Like you can see 43 heads in build mod but most are not accessible yet.
---
There more to do before you get full access.
---
I mean maybe it makes them friendly. I never hacked one except the vendor bots. Apparently the Charleston vendor bot has it's trade and hack being the same button somehow while others don't. When I interact with it, a notification for the perk appears.
---
I dunno...the skin for the "Keep Out" backpack is fucking awesome with any armor/costume combo.
---
The problem is all the other games were single player. You had saves, you had console commands, you had no reliance on server stability/memory. Nearly every major issue with the game had a community-made mod to fix it. You can't compare a MMO to the same standards as them. At least they are still fixing this game, while with the single player ones they just released a few patches after launch and abandoned ship. 
---
Also, that's just flat out wrong. Even the most recent versions of (for this example) fallout 3 have plenty of major issues with basic features. Here's some stuff taken directly from the wiki
---
&gt; The Puppies! perk also has a problem, when you have a follower fired, Dogmeat's puppy takes up a space and you will not be able to have a follower in your party anymore. 
---
&gt; [Demolition expert] The Nuka-grenade is not affected by this perk. Grenades and mines used within the Anchorage Reclamation simulation are not affected by this perk
---
There's an entire page of bugs related to the mysterious stranger, which usually boil down to either you get stuck in VATS and have to reload or the stranger kills you
---
&gt; [Warmonger] This perk works perfectly for the Nuka-grenade and bottlecap mine. However, for all other schematics, this perk only updates the notes section of your Pip-Boy. It does not upgrade the game variables that control the quality of the items you create.
---
Liberty prime also has nearly a full page of bugs, the main ones being that he can get stuck and break your game unless you can load back to before you started the fight
---
That's not to mention the exploits that people can perform that are unlikely to happen on accident, like finishing the entire game as a baby or the MANY ways of glitching outside the map
---
Short answer: No.
---
Long answer: Nope
---
I had the same problem.  Server hopping at Wavy Willards was what did it for me, plus its pretty quick/easy to see if the corpse spawns as hes just up against the first/central car in the parking lot.  You basically just run straight from the spawn point a few steps and if hes not slumped against the car, hop again.
---
I second the idea of checking nearby players because you will likely get back onto the same server a few times.
---
I kept a prominent section of my camp up with lettering that said ‚ÄúDISCORD‚Äù followed by my user name on the next line. 
---
Have to have your buddy follow you to camp and is a bit long in the tooth but it ‚Äòworks‚Äô.
---
Thanks for sharing! I think you can also get Stingwing and Radroch. I got a repeated firefly today, so it does drop here too.
---
You have a giant straw / tube built into the helmet obviously and carry a juicer to liquidise everything :)
---
I appreciate there is Fallout lore used to explain a lot of unrealistic things but it's so far sometimes that you just have to accept it and move on.
---
I've caught disease from bugs that I've killed before they got near me so perhaps it's more like Plague Walker and is transmitted by a radius.
---
I mite just try this.
---
That sounds like a really good idea. The map looks really big to me but what's missing for me is the NPC's :'(
---
People have a need to kill bosses as fast as possible, so let Explosive Two Shot mayhem begin :/
---
Yes. The radiators work for items that don't need a wire. The radiator typically needs to be within about 2 walls away (sometimes 1.5). If you connect the radiator to a conduit connector (the round piece with connector pipe on one or more sides), it should power up. And just make sure there is power running through the pipe -- that's where the round connector comes in. But it doesn't look great. 
---
On my current build, I just ended up using wire from one wall connector to another ( no pipe or radiators). And that does the same as the radiator, with less headache. My wire is right along the wall and looks a bit like part of the design.
---
Conduit is annoying though. The pipe won't even run straight and it's unsightly. On my recent build, I did use some conduit, and some pass throughs. But mainly tried to string wire out of the way in the best way I could. Saved me a lot on budget too.
---
I ment was the responders or brotherhood of steel, or the overseer supposed to give us hint or push us in the right direction, I just didn't want to skip anything
---
Something less linear than that.  I don't know the equation (it may be possible to data mine something like that), but I'm reasonably sure that I do just as much damage with my rifle at 50 yards as I do at 1.  But way out there at 100 or whatever, it definitely seems to do less.
---
Something like the first 50% of your range is 100%, then drops off 2% damage per 1% range after.  It might not be that smooth, but as someone else stated, it's hard to test when we can't really measure easily in game.
---
Wow that's abhorrent. Hard pass on survival until it gets to be more survival-y
---
50 yards is 45.72 meters
---
I'm not saying do it every time you just use it to get a frame of reference then you know how much hp you have after a while you'll be able to tell just by looking how close you are.  Also when you get the heartbeat audio that's your cue that your at 20%.
---
You must be tons of fun at parties

The enclave ai gives you quests over the radio, or it did for me

"I'll be breaking out the cheap moonshine, so that sir/ma'am may drink in a manner more suitable for him/her."

*Your robot hands you nukashine*
---
LOL nice one :) and true
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a little ridiculous. It‚Äôs sad that a level 200+ doesn‚Äôt know this. Hopefully this gets seen so more people understand.
---
Yeah but how many rods is that? :P
---
(good bot!)
---
I've never gotten one from Campfire Tales, but I can confirm all but the Molerat dropping from Sting &amp; Things. I've gotten all the mountable bugs from that event, not saying the Molerat doesn't drop from it but it doesn't really fit in with the quest so sounds odd.
---
Oh damn that's awesome, I didnt even know about that! Thank you
---
Aww man
---
Good boy Convertron3000
---
Right? FO:NV had ammo scrapping. Why not 76?
---
Is this fusion cores or plasma cores because I‚Äôm on the plasma Gatling
---
Hmmm, I might try this method from now on. I've been going more for the random occurrence of a 'good server' as opposed to the longevity of the server.
---
I was given the plans for a mounted tick from Stings and Things a few days ago
---
Some people like having an overpowered build that can one shot most enemies in the game. I find it too boring, but it's clearly popular enough to be meta. When you keep your rads down to 80% you don't have to worry about accidentally healing off that bloodied/nerd rage/adrenal reaction bonus
---
Maybe down the road as you travel, you can come across some. This could make it where we continue our mission to rebuild America. Maybe we are the first ones who actually create the basis for settlements and what kicked the turn of events for the other games. We are the first ones to help people learn how to rebuild societies.
---
It forces change and I see that is a very good thing. I play it maybe 10-20%, the rest is Adventure
---
Deathclaw Gauntlet and Mole Miner Gauntlet can both have an extra 'blade' mod added to increase damage and enemie pawnage.
---
I'm get over 2000 damage with my Bloodied Deathclaw, I'm hoping beyond hope for the same with +40% swing speed.
---
RNG is a Fickle Bitch, I'm still looking for the Raider Shielded Plan at level 130.
---
There are a few random Spawn points that it has a very small chance of spawning in (Still RNG).
---
The Train Car West of Watoga is one location, I have found it there myself twice, also laying on a bookshelf between Pleasant Valley Lodge &amp; Top of the World, from in front of the lodge, head towards TOTW, up the steps, then turn left, there is a little Flea market looking vendor booth with a plan Spawn laying on the shelf.
---
You will only find the plans there once a day, but if you server hop without picking it up, the plan will change, there are other locations as well but those are the ones I could think of right off hand.
---
Meat hook for now gains both unarmed and one handed melee perks so it does the most damage in the game
---
Where's your budget at?
---
If camp budget is full you can't place more turrets even if not at max.
---
Yeah I have more than the default carry weight. I'm at work so I can't check but I play with two builds:
---
One is a bloodied unyielding that doesn't wear power armor, has shielding underarmor and a standard 60 carry weight backpack. I am pretty sure my limit from memory is 340 at 20% health and 315 at 30% (when you respawn with a rads build it goes back to 30%).
---
So it's like +60 (backpack) +15 (shielded operative underarmor) + 50/75 (from unyielding, depends on rad level) 
---
My other is a heavy weapon power armor build, and I use excavator armor with calibrated shocks. Weight limit is something like 520 on login (you get a bugged extra 100) and 420 after exiting PA or dying. 
---
Excavator does something like +50 (PA STR bonus) +100 (full excavator) +100 (calibrated shocks) +100 (login bug, not always active)
---
The bug happens consistently on both characters. I am almost never overencumbered as I fast travel a lot.
---
Curious, can you use lettering in game on your CAMP that could shout out your discord?  I just got lettering and never used them yet. Greek, and those small letters?  Maybe this could be a walk around. 
---
I do think that text communication should have been implemented however take ‚ÄòRust‚Äô as a prime example of the fucking cancer that breeds there. So I kind of get it either way. Pretty sure we all didn‚Äôt want a Rust style game with fukboiz ruining it for all.  Sure, could opt out I guess?
---
That's good advice, I'll get a feel for it I guess eventually.
---
Give me your missles. Lol. Ive found so many players that just give me whatever missles they find. I always offer to pay like 10c each, but most of the time they just dump em because they are already lvl 200 or something.
---
I need to get on your server! 
---
Most people I encounter are listing their legendaries at 1000% increase - for crap! 
---
Now, if's it's actually good - the price is at least 10,000 caps. 
---
Every now and then, you get someone (usually a high level) selling at 2x value but ever sense the purveyor showed up, I've seen the opposite of you. 
---
Now, with all that, vending machines are relatively new so I'm sure the market will cool once people realize that nobody is going to spend that much for your crappy legendary armor/weapon.
---
Your nerd rage is your indicator when not on power armor it procs a soon as you hit 20%
---
Im working on a mad doc build now. Sadly I had learnt the laser and plasma gun plans. But they got snapped and now I don‚Äôt have them. 
---
The tank girl sounds cool. Definitely would need some work but seems like a support raider.
---
They could fix the mistake of scrapping bulk items with a confirmation dialogue. Not really a big deal if they just added that. It would remind us we have something bulked in our inventory.
---
It‚Äôs apparently a bug. Two of my turrets were destroyed by a scorchbeast. I hit ‚Äòrepair all‚Äô, everything else was fixed but the missing turrets don‚Äôt show up, the power lines just float there attached to nothing. I got into build mode, but it won‚Äôt let me build them, saying ‚Äòmaximum count reached‚Äô. So when the rest of my turrets get destroyed, I will not have any turrets to protect my camp any more. Very annoying to have bugs like these.
---
The quests for the various factions are modular, not necessarily linear. They are fairly self contained and do have an order in that when one finishes, it points you to the next, but most do not require you to do the previous faction before starting on the next with the exception of the raiders and free states since you need an item from the end of the raiders quest line in the first part of the free states.
---
So while the game will lead you in the order of Responders-&gt;Raiders-&gt;Free States-&gt;Brotherhood-&gt;Enclave  you can do them in any order as long (with exception of having to do the Raiders before Free States).
---
Completing any of the factions does not prevent you from completing any other quests for any other factions.
---
It's only extreme if you don't mind the occasional PvP. I do, and would prefer it go away. There's rarely a problem taking a workshop; it's keeping it that can be the problem. My own experience is that you'll own it until someone decides they want to pop you for whatever junk you happen to be carrying; frequently, they could care less about the workshop itself. There's zero sport in some stealthed sniper one-shotting you with a crit. Not my cup of tea. You're welcome to it.
---
Yeah I will miss enforcer when I go handmade. it's amazing lol
---
If the guy is high level and if there's shards, optics, or silver I'll take those for turret repair and camera. Looting the whole bag is kind of rude! xD 
---
Well that's not entirely true.. loot the whole bag if they are out of control around mein kamp, and get turned into iguana bits. Or if they take all the free magazines out my vendor or on the mic (even though I can't hear them, see the icon) I assume it's bad- so they get the chamber and a full looting
---
Oh I don't use any of the chems besides diluted stim and radaway, I just have to wait until I have the water to dilute all my stims, and wait for vendor to have more caps
---
Can confirm stingwing, just got it
---
See... just preference of course. But I like it that way.
---
Had a ton of fun in Conan: Exiles with my buddies... house rule was no telling each other where we were, had to find each others homes.
---
Too bad that game was such a dumpster fire, had great potential.
---
But, in FO76, I want a full on survival mode. No character indicators on map, more focus on survival than finding legendaries, not a "death-match = survival" game. I just want to feel like I'm trying to actually survive in the wacky, weird FO universe.
---
The only way to get explosive launchers to perform at the level (in my opinion) that they should, is by running a low-health build and then using either Bloodied, Instigating, or Two-Shot explosive launchers. 
---
I don‚Äôt bother with grenades anymore simply because there‚Äôs no legendary grenades. So grenades are fine when compared to basic weapons, but you start throwing legendary effects on the weapons and grenades quickly fall behind. Same problem with throwing knives and axes.
---
I die regularly, I may get a lot of damage from my bloodied weapons but it needs timing and being a glass canon adds a great thrill while approaching enemies, I only play PVE so no idea what bloodied is like against players.
---
One miss hit or network/server induced melee swing lag and I'm hovering over my body like a fly over a drain :)
---
Hello! Im here to procure your useless pipe rifle.
---
Yeah but I've seen plenty of camps inside nuke zone, only the nuke impact should wreck camps.
---
This is pretty much my set up I just wish they had a black suit with a black shirt and tie! I‚Äôve been using my handmades because it‚Äôs the closest thing to an AR but wish we had a semi auto shotgun like a benneli. I do need to get a good bloodied 10mm pistol though.
---
Pay to win*
---
*note I‚Äôm saying this being sarcastic.  In this day and age, I think pointing this out is sadly necessary.
---
Did you try switching pipboy modes and then back?
---
On Xbox it's select button while pipboy is open
---
I really dislike PvP. I'm not geared for it physically and not vested in it emotionally. The people who want to fight now have servers dedicated to fighting where things really matter (as the OP pointed out). Let the people who who want to fight head over to the PvP servers and let the rest of us live together in peace.
---
Turn on Nerd Rage, and then lower your health. When it procs on screen, you are below 20% health.
---
Particularly good ones will often go for over 10K.  I spent 10K on my current SBQ weapon, and would drop twice that for a better one (though I'm picky).
---
I also picked up a few really nice, but not terribly great weapons for under 1K, but other people sell similar ones for 5-7K.  It varies a lot.
---
Then again, I've probably spent 5K in travel fees just shopping.  It is probably better in the long run to eat the higher price and save on the airfare.
---
Wouldn't it make the game run slower if we have NPC's?
---
I spent the entire day memorial day rebuilding my camp it literally took me over 5 hours. Had to use so many glitchy work arounds. Agree with the whole post, even the pass through complaint, they are hard to use.
---
 No I had not. Thanks it does make a difference.
---
Hell yes!
---
I run a bloodied build and only carry 4-6 stimpacks on me. Thank you healing factor
---
i feel im too old to use certain phrases, but his is the very definition of "cringe"
---
That Plan can drop as well. You can also force it to drop in a clever way. Same with Raider lining too.
---
Before doing the BOS quest line or talking to Rose, buy the 3 plans before it at the appropriate vendor. You cannot server hop to force them to spawn the next level though.
---
So day 1, buy the level 1 plan.
---
Day 2, buy level 2 plan.
---
Day 3, buy the level 3 version.
---
Go complete Rose questline. Part of her reward on one of the later missions will be a plan drop for the underarmor. Since you already know the previous 3 she will give you the shielded.
---
Same with BOS storyline.
---
Figured this out on my 3rd character... never looked back since.
---
&gt;bloodied/nerd rage/adrenal reaction bonus
---
 bloodied/nerd rage/adrenal reaction bonus 
---
There's a mouthful, is this some Adrenal Reaction bug thing I keep seeing?
---
I saw people with the flame paint on their power armor stations before it was in the store soooo where do you get that in game?
---
At the cost of 60 RR/ER? No thank you. 
---
It's for emergency overencumbrence only.
---
Yeah it usually costs 20-30 caps for me, not to mention the two loads screens which is the worse part imo.
---
Seen this in another game, what would happen:
---
Scammer: "Gifting Atom shop items for caps."
---
Mark: "Sure, here are the caps. I want a-"
---
Scammer disconnects with the caps never to be seen again.
---
Now Bethesda has to manage an entirely new customer service category even if just to say "Can't help you, buyer beware". This is why we can't have nice things.
---
I appreciate it - duly - but I‚Äôm a filthy PS 4 player (I do see the message below)
---
Well, the over encumbered on death would normally give you choice of spawning nearby (potentially for a cap cost) or at ‚Äò76. If you are dying too far from a PoI, you may only be given the option of ‚Äò76.
---
And the thing I was talking about is are you overencumbered if you take off all your armor? Because that‚Äôs what death does. So (for example) maybe your carry weight in Excavator is 400 normally, and you‚Äôre carrying 300. But out of Excavator, you can only carry 250. Well, when you die, you‚Äôre now at 300/250 and thus stuck over encumbered.
---
Do you think that they will keep adding content to the game after this?
---
I would agree. I got it before I had to go to work and didn't have time to check the perks.
---
I think they look terrible too. I carry one for emergencies only.
---
I really do not want a Battle Royale mode... Isn't the whole purpose of the game to re-build together?
---
I see that - and I shall take you up on it. I don‚Äôt get to log in all that often, but I‚Äôll hit you up as soon as I can. Much appreciated. Let me know if you need anything in return
---
great idea
---
 They are fools. I can put a 40mm into a corner I'm standing in and take no damage. My X0-1 suffers damage from explosions and I have to be careful, as I'm used to my BoS Heavy Combat.
---
 I don't doubt the rest of the Heavy Weapons benefit, but for explosive builds its not optimum.
---
I gave up and glitched it through the wall for my generator room.
---
I just wish they had straps!! Lol i hate it being velcored to my back üòÖ
---
The enemies are like NPCs but made to attack. So NPCs won't do anything.
---
Gotta get the kids in though
---
I've had the others since around level 25, and done UF over 100 times, now at level 230+ and still never got the Raider Shielded Plan, but have all the others.
---
I ca two shot a lvl 65 SB with my 1* bloodied dragon.
---
So many unnecessary bounties
---
Try a YouTube video, or a few of them? This information is out already. Repair kits, camera, sheepquest, backpacks, burrows, atomic shop free items.
---
What daily is this? I'm not familiar with anything up there.
---
Its me. I make enemies as I'm old and not very gentle. ;)
---
A daily challenge, for atom points
---
They lack the tools to do so? If this is true I'm playing the wrong game because obviously if they can't correct something they can't protect this game from outside influences. üò£
---
I just got it done though
---
Down voted for sharing information.....wtf. I hate this community.
---
Raiding for life
---
 My Lever Action hits at 147 today. ;)
---
I was going to suggest that but it does take up a lot of budget to use those letters and I know personally my camp is maxed on budget so a lot of.others would have a similar issue I'm sure. Would also be a bummer to have to use all that budget just to shout out the channel.
---
Stash your junk and skip QoL perks and start killing scorchbeasts . The penalty for dying is pretty forgiving for a survival game imo.
---
Except the post is about selling modded backpacks, not about selling backpacks to people who can't wear them. Your issue has a simple fix, if you're not a possum, you can't wear a backpack, even if you buy one. 
---
That aside, we can sell the plans already (they're being sold for exorbitant prices). I'd be happy if people with plans could craft the mods as sellable parts like you can buy from vendors. Then I could craft myself mods and hand them over to my alts and be done with this mess. I'd be even happier with your solution, earn the badges and have it unlock account wide would be my favorite solution to this, I just don't see it happening.
---
They can't, or simply won't and say they can't, adjust player inventory.
---
the "rules" that were already broken by the Unstoppables costumes and the repair kits?
---
Option to not build a camp in Whitesprings would be... wait, there is that option!
---
Those are the best combinations I've been working with as well.  Wish it didn't have the shovel though, it kinda kills it for me a little.
---
Actually scrap that backpack and go to your armor workbench to create another that has +60 carry weight. Cool story tho.
---
Lol my alt is the same. Put a cop hat on him and own it. The tadpole hat is pretty good too with the tattered dress
---
In the trash, where it belongs haha.
---
Juciehead has some good YouTube videos about everything
---
Eastern side of the WS resort, on a small hill north of the WS bunker entrance and south of the WS service entrance.
---
The issue occurs when moving your camp from one location to another, and attempting to add it from the blueprint in "Stored".
---
The camp object will be green, however when attempting to place it, the error message is "Cannot place item: needs support".
---
I've read that the error can occur if one object inside the camp is clipped into another object.  Trying to place workbenches close to one another, or close to a wall, is supposedly related to this issue.
---
I just spent 4h rebuilding my camp for what must be at least the tenth time.  I've got a lot of conduit, so every time is a finicky time-consuming slog.
---
Bethesda, please prioritize this bug.
---
Make a new psn/Xbox account and log in with that one.
---
Most reports I've seen said no. But I haven't done so myself.
---
like 400 pounds XD
---
but like regardless of how much weight I am carrying, I should be able to respawn??
---
They give you a code so that you can‚Äôt request a refund.
---
Kill SBQ
---
No judgement here, I was wondering what the drop to carry ratio was for you; as you say, patch notes said the amount was reduced, but I wasn't sure what the actual number was to begin with. :D
---
But for some players the npc will say something and for another player it might say something else so it makes it kind of hard to program , gotta invest some time in Elder scrolls online to figure it out :o
---
Did your money transfer?  Sometimes if the owner of the vending machine logs out or gets dc'd the transaction doesn't happen.  I've noticed people's camps hang around for a bit after people log off so maybe that was the issue?
---
Thank you that help, but now I have to start over again because by 6th got deleted, 6 times, get ready for a rant later on because I got a fire in me and it's coming out
---
Don't buy a used copy. The code won't work if it's been used already. Guys are using a vpn to get the game really cheap, but it's better to support them if you have the money.
---
No! Do not day that !! U_U
---
Actually having an offline mode would allow everything to be downloaded, so you can just play whenever. Weekly updates to update the challenges or whatever. No need to take up servers with single player content. As I posted, single player is not solo player. I just get tired of starting over at level 1 and being shot at by 80+ level players right out of the vault. I know and they know they can not hurt me but, it is just stupid beyond belief. I had that happen day one, 56 level player shooting at me right out of the vault within my first 6 minutes of game. Things like that just make me dislike MMO and always online games. I have 800 hours in Diablo 3, all single player, lol. I get that some like multi player and such, I just wish there were options to not have to put up with others when you are not trying to have a comedy game.
---
I hear you. Luckily that survivor look is what I‚Äôm going for. 
---
But I agree, it could have been a foldable one or maybe better placed on there
---
Fred's Bbq
---
On xb1 sorry.
---
Pretty much. Although maybe have some needing to be placed on the edges of bodies of water like cranberries, bloodleaf, and snaptail reeds.
---
I do however dream of being able to farm mushrooms and fungi. [Farming mushrooms looks sick!!](https://grocycle.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Insulated-fridge-panel-mushroom-grow-room-1024x576.jpg) I mean [look at this!](https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/012/046/976/f59a583c6824c6cfbd9b2bb0efde0409_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-2.0.0&amp;crop=faces&amp;w=1552&amp;h=873&amp;fit=crop&amp;v=1463727113&amp;auto=format&amp;frame=1&amp;q=92&amp;s=79ed31a7a151a3e0ea987787296ecbc0)
---
[Here](https://www.namyco.org/growing_mushrooms_at_home.php) is some of the various methods to grow them! Firecaps, Glowing Fungus, Brain Fungus, Blight, and maybe those yellow mushrooms we always find across Appalachia! I want to farm them all!!
---
On XB1 sorry mate.
---
Its a random percentage, so you just dice rolled 75 stims away. Stack that percentage in your favor and carry less good stuff and more useless spoiled meats and beers.
---
I agree, I would like a single player or co-op game, with a zone or whatever for multi player pvp. Easy enough to implement. That way you can play the game you want to play and everyone can do the same. Immersion is a big thing for me,  so silly players and such break that feeling a ton in 76 for me.
---
It has a certain tension to it if that's what you mean.  But it's basically shoot first ask questions later.  The coop is the best part of FO76 imo and there is basically none of that here unless you play survival mode with your friends.  There really isn't much of a reason to play survival unless you enjoy pvp, and pvp in FO76 is not very good.
---
I think Bethesda has a timer that does not allow legendaries to spawn, and then it gives you a big wave of legendaries so that you stay addicted to the grind.
---
you can only go 5 or 6 stairs high...at least on PS4.
---
Now i have seen it all...
---
I could just as easily call you a fool for only running Explosives, it‚Äôd make about as much sense. If something is that close to me, I just spray it with an LMG or 50cal. There‚Äôs no reason for me to set off high explosives in my own face. They‚Äôre for groups of enemies at range (autogrenade), long range ‚Äúsniping‚Äù (tracking missile launcher), or one-shot supremacy on big targets (fat man).
---
Ya, they were in the camp and i talked to them to confirm they had indeed been selling a 2* Rifle from their machine.  They got the notification and caps, I got nothing.
---
ok peeps.  thanx.  i really think it is all because of my monitor.  actually, it is a 60" sanyo LCD.  all my other "real" monitors are hdmi or dvi ports, and this new vid card only has 1 hdmi and like 4 display ports.  looks like i am buying a new monitor next payday.
---
PC all the way. I have it on PS4 &amp; PC. Running it on PC is a much better experience.
---
I have and will not play PVP. It's all about your OP build. I really wish it was a more even playing ground. 
---
People put their worth vicariously in their armor and guns in this game it's kind of sad actually. I've ran into so many egotistical people in this game. That's right. They've developed a weird egotistical thing where they are proud of how good their guns and armor are. That and all the assholes who will grief and troll you in Survival. This game is full of some cool people, but equally it's toxic and fitting for it's reputation.
---
The only bug that fucking irritates me is the ‚ÄúFRIEND(main menu)‚Äù can‚Äôt invite the person standing right in front of you ! So aggravating.
---
Or worse, grenades.
---
Visit nuked zones, used to be Whitesprings but it was nerfed. I think that Burrows spawns a decent amount of enemies when nuked so you should be able to grab a bit of exp there.
---
Hell no! Mothman is mine and he doesnt have time for you groupies. If i catch you in point pleasant again, im gonna cut you. I catch you looking, thinking or dreaming about my man, imma cut you. Do yourself a favor sweetie and go after the grafton monster, your more his type anyways.
---
I did this earlier. First time was a mirelurk horde and I get 3 legendary drops including the boss. Had to kill it because the horde aggrod a scorchbeast. Second time was super mutant horde but a couple of other people joined the event and murdered the boss before I could really get any results. You'd think a player hanging around a half dead, crippled boss would've at least raised questions but nope, they just ran in and killed it.

Aquaperson perk would be best since it eliminates rads as well.
---
Have some

You probably got placed into the same server like 7 times lol
---
I am female and run around in the rocketgirl outfit. Usually with the fasnacht owl mask cuz it matches very well. But most of the time you wouldn't hear me. 
---
Most of the women I know don't use a mic. At all. A few will have one around for the occasional interaction. This seems backed up by research.
---
[https://kotaku.com/teenage-girls-are-playing-video-games-you-just-might-n-1724547085](https://kotaku.com/teenage-girls-are-playing-video-games-you-just-might-n-1724547085)  
---
I'm not offended by guys being rude. I have the chameleon mutation and will happily figure out some amusing method of stalking them &amp; murdering them while blasting a good angry rap track through the mic or whatever. But that's not my main motivation for playing fallout and I'd rather not make it a bigger side quest than necessary. So you're typically better off without a mic unless you have specific interest in roleplaying fallout 76 as an assassin. I'd really rather focus on important things like choosing the perfect scenic location for my new bar/club camp &amp; locating the disco ball.
---
A little. If you explore around high level players ennemies will have a higher level and vice-versa.
---
There is a mechanic to prevent unwanted PVP. If you claim a workshop you may lose that protection.
---
I‚Äôm only lvl 32 on my alt so I need something a little easier
---
So far I've only played it to do the weekly. Challenge and get a 3star weapon. My goal is to get in and get out as fast as possible.
---
Made for the shovel back pack it shows
---
My gt= texware
---
I mostly play on the weekends
---
One is a metal hook used for hanging up meat. The other is a gauntlet fashioned from the hand of a large, predator lizard.
---
For sure. You could get by with auto pistol for mob trash clear, and one-handed melee for your armor-piercing needs; "Dodgy" would let that large VATs pool remain helpful when you melee.
---
I cant tell you how many times my friend and I killed each other and ourselves to try and finish that darn quest.  Is there a extra carry weight upgrade for the back pack because I am over encumbered again ?
---
O_O
---
More, please
---
You could try backpacking an Arktos event. It is recommended 50+ but it spawns a ton of enemies usually if there's a decent sized group and if you just stay up high somewhere and tag (please do your best to kill things though) creatures you can also get a decent amount from there as well.
---
Here's a tip, don't carry your bulge around in your pants. You don't need to prove anything to anyone here. Just carry your junk instead of your bulk. Either way its still just junk in your pants. Please don't go around and drop your junk but if you do please pick up your junk off the ground as decently as possible. No one wants your junk let along see it on the ground.
---
I‚Äôm fairly certain the range stat is the range it does normal damage at; the degradation is past that. 
---
However, the range stat doesn‚Äôt seem to actually be in meters or feet, I‚Äôm fairly certain it‚Äôs in Bethesda Units. Significantly less than feet. I‚Äôve gotten decent at eyeballing distances and giving a foot measurement IRL, and that sure as hell doesn‚Äôt equate to what the range rating in-game shows vs what it ‚Äúlooks‚Äù like it should be.
---
I also scrapped a bunch of scout armor and got zero mods. I'd be curious where to buy them.
---
Unyielding for vats. I havd about 420 ap with 3 ap refresh pieces &amp; some ap refresh perks...lets say im not switching anytime soon üëç
---
I dont use sneak perk...agility at 34 and i can sneak up to a deathclaw infront of him
---
Pic?
---
Pretty good roll , glad you got something good. I've spent countless hours farming scrip and still nothing yet.
---
I have a toooon of random 1-2 star unyielding pieces on PC. Been collecting for months for player vending; really not selling very fast.
---
Every once in a while you'll get something pretty good. It is pretty rare though. I've gotten a few explosive 10mm pistols. If you are getting junk I would server hop. Seems like it rolls similar stuff for me. I got 5 heavy weapons in a row on one server and 2 were hunters prefix miniguns and 2 broadsiders.
---
That‚Äôs dope
---
Have they even made the color of the font/menus adjustable like Fallout 4? I haven‚Äôt played in a long time
---
fucking ice. cold.
---
SIXTEEN TIMES THE DETAIL
---
Yes is just a bug , happens with a lot of events look at the uranium fever sometimes it shows  next to the mountains of solomon's pond. But when you join the event is at blackwater mine
---
And since you didn't know that maybe you won't know this, there is mothman lore in real life. And a movie based on it.
---
Lmfao I‚Äôve done it so many times and still haven‚Äôt gotten the s‚Äômores recipe, I gave up and bought it
---
I can get up to 20 charisma with my armor...spent about 2k scrips and only gotten  shit from her
---
Id say Yes and no. Ppl are not running around with duped op weapons like everyone claims. I 2 shotted a guy with a no star marksman rifle who was lvl93 and im lvl20.  You just die that fast.
---
Events protect you so you can still quest with others. 
---
Only being able to fast travel to trains is a mixed bag. On one hand i like being forced to walk around and the world is big enough that you can never really run into ppl. 
---
But if you do travel be ready for instant death. 
---
I meet fun people all the time. I was hiding from a PA guy who happend to be in the airport with me... I put my gun away and he did the follow me emote so we cleared the place together.
---
Had a squeaky voice call me a dirty n***r. So same as any other game lol
---
Good out weighs the bad for me. Only big gripe is the leaderboard. If im off doing my own thing i dont want to be suddenly hunted by being on the map. Thats just stupid. Its much more fun when im clearing a building and i hear other players..just kinda run into each other and see how it goes. Freind or foe thats a much more enjoyable experience for me.
---
I have been playing, off and on, since February. I have heard in-game chat twice.
---
10mm pistols are kinda trash, I prefer the 10mm submachine gun over the 10mm pistols.
---
The only problem with the ragdoll physics is that corpses seem to either have almost no weight, or gravity is turned down to about 25%. Watched a flying scorchbeast die and see how far it bounces!
---
The left over .01x from (.03 x 3x) might get thrown away (assuming the weight of plastic for said bulk item is also discarded). I haven't tested it yet. Either way, cool and thanks for bringing this to my attention!
---
This soo much!!! I am really enjoying the game, I have finally figured out a way to play being a father of a 1 year old. It‚Äôs not easy I have to jump on and off and sometimes find a good place to hide. I do enjoy going to other players camps and running into a player here and there.
---
In the hopes I can contribute, the Warframe Devstream is the perfect example to refer to. While some aspects can be easily modified to fit time or staffing constraints, i feel they've nailed combining the spirit of community with progress updates. I sing praises to every MMO and MMOLite i've ever played that any addition to that effect significantly boosts community investment and positive outlook to the game and their dev team. I hope you can take a look.
---
10mm submachine guns are kinda trash, I prefer the Walking Cane over the 10mm submachine guns
---
I've made a good amount now so I'll throw it out. I've been farming these and selling them and I saw at least one other camp doing the same so you're not just racing the server/player side timer.
---
That‚Äôs more than high enough ;) 2 stairs on a high foundation will cripple you from full health. 3 would likely kill you.
---
And I'm sure both groups can get this to work correctly.
---
F!
---
My vendor account is by a pond with a nice high set of stairs and platform over the water for a nice little ‚Äúdie-ving‚Äù board.
---
I need more friends to play with! I play by myself a lot and it‚Äôs just ok unless I‚Äôve had a drink or two. I want to explore more with a team because I get too nervous to venture out a lot without backup.
---
I saw a person selling purified water for 20 caps each.  I was like WTF dude.  That deserved a thumbs down emote
---
I mean in game chat is how I‚Äôve found the people I play with now and have been for some time which is probably why I‚Äôm more drawn to play everyday if even a hour or so.
---
&lt;steps slowly away from keyboard&gt;
---
1 - Go to cranberry bog. Obtain as many cranberries and diseased cranberries as you can.
---
2 - Craft diseased cranberries into cranberry juice (+2% xp). Craft cranberries into cranberry cobbler (+5% xp).
---
3 - consume before performing crafting or combat.
---
You XP yields are increased with your current Intelligence stat. You can check this in the SPECIAL tab in your pipboy.
---
Take berry mentats (+5) or daddy-o (+3) to increase your Intelligence.
---
Survival mode (+20% xp). Inspirational perk (+5%, +10%, +15%). Leader Bobble head (+5%). Live &amp; love magazine (+5%).
---
These can all stack with eachother. I get well over 250xp per kill on level 62 ghouls.
---
Edit: Well Rested (sleeping for 30s) and Well Tuned (instrument for 30s) both grant XP boosts.
---
A full set of Unyielding armor grants +15 Intelligence at low HP. Happy hunting!
---
I am also confident that they con do that, I've been playing for almost a day and I really like the game but it is missing that .. The NPc's..
---
Aaaaannnd we here have the person that really tries to copy someone else‚Äôs comment and mock them because they have a different opinion..what do you people think about this person?
---
Hey. Maybe it's a good thing. More players spawning in more missiles. You could camp there and get their missiles before you even load in for them.
---
Turn pacifist mode on.
---
I know the feeling of wanting solo mode at times but I'm fine with online mode. It grew on me and I like that I can interact with others. I didn't enjoy playing with others until I played this game. This a unique game for me.
---
Yeah I like how they just added vender to shops that were already there. :/
---
 Lets put it this way. A level 80 Scorchbeast jumped me at the spawn point at Harper's Ferry. It landed, silly thing, and it died very fast to my Combat Knife.
---
 The reason I run Explosion resistance was for Scorchbeasts originally. As I like stupid things, I picked up an Auto Grenade Launcher for my big gun. That's when I discovered the resistance I have to explosives is so good. It is fun to use as a melee weapon, but really just for fun.
---
 When I rolled a Bloodied one at the Vendor I was happy as its perfect for Sheepsquatches and other heavy hitters, like high level  Deathclaws and Bears, things I don't really like to get right up close and personal with. ;)
---
You are not using the plastic and keeping it, the cost of bulking is 2 plastic. You're throwing plastic on the ground.
---
There's an old technique to send wires through walls but I don't know if it still works, haven't tried. But essentially you build a doorway and send the wire through the hole to its destination and then change the doorway into a wall. You can also send wires through windows.
---
Also you can send power through a ceiling by using radius power emitter on each side of it and then to get wires you attach the wire conduit to the emiter. Requires advanced connectors.
---
Something tells me that the personal terminal will handle this kind of functionality (and more) in the not too distance future.
---
Stick to the forest and toxic valley for awhile. A great way to earn caps, experience, meds, and plans is to capture workshops and defend them.  You can get lots of materials as well when you set up extractors in the workshops.
---
The first rule of Magic Server Club is that we don't talk about Magic Server Club.
---
I will be seriously bummed if this ever gets patched.  I found a Magic Server 2 days in a row this past weekend!  It's going to take days to dump all the loot into  the machine!
---
at level 32 best thing to power level is hit up whitesprings with an instigating weapon and sneak around 1 shotting all the enemies, you can start doing this around lvl 15, then server hop once you kill them all, repeat
---
then try the burrows or west tec if you get bored with whitesprings
---
be sure to get well rested bonus for more xp, if you have teammates use inspirational perk for more xp, and eat cranberry mash i think to increase xp gain
---
How can I get the crystallising barrel ? Is that a mod ?
---
No he I have seen him at many of the random encounter spots throughout the map. Farming his plans used to be very lucrative.
---
Not to mention how much camp budget they might take up.
---
Though Whitesprings is often the target, Nukes can be targeted all over the map. Back when I was a wee-level I was flattened near Morgantown Airport in my humble abode.
---
Being a Southern/Central location Whitesprings is a nice place to CAMP at for map access, the enemy spawns are very farmable, and the foot traffic for vending, or just hanging out to chat, is hard to beat.
---
Just saying that it'd be nice to get notified that things are about to get crispy as soon as you spawn.
---
Sure, brag about it :p
---
I suppose they expect everyone to be on reddit or be techy and understand concepts like jumping servers until they find the event active somewhere. I only attempted to start gaming with others relatively recently, but it's not at all uncommon that when my team(s) wants to hit an event together, that server's already full. I assume with all the other people who are hopping around looking for it. That just seems like a fairly inefficient setup and unnecessarily server-intensive.
---
I think it would be easier for people to say anything if you tell us what did you use.
---
i hope so! for the cost of the neon lettering its sad they take up so much space per letter
---
PC ): &lt;3 though! I'm determined to get my hands on it in-game at this rate!
---
Instead of it being a short and easy quest like the booze update was, it's a bit harder to get the back pack. For this one there's 4 parts. There are 2 small fetch quests for these scout robots, easy. The third quest is to revive another player, which seems to have upset people who play solo. Once these 3 are done you have to collect 3 tadpole badges, which has upset the most people.
---
The tadpole badges are under challanges in the map menu and some are pretty hard, pretty dang long, and some are just straight up broken. 
---
However there are 3 that are simple enough, Swimmer, Archer, Athelete, which will net you a backpack which you can then update to +60 carry weight. Again for swimmer, one of the challanges is ‚Äùrevive a player in water‚Äù so that riled some people up. I think it balances out as 3 parts to that badge are literally ‚Äùtake a picture at the water park‚Äù. 
---
People are being lazy because something they want isn't really easy to get. This is a multiplayer game and some are essentially mad that multiplayer content is being added. If you want the pack, hit up Reddit. There are guides on how to do it, and people who will help you get the revive challenges, locations for the swimming or balance courses, and so on. 
---
TBH once you've got it you can just stop. A +60 carry weight pack is great and if you don't want to mod (more armour, refrigerate food etc) it you can just get on with playing the game with a nice boost to your carry weight.
---
Just posting what happened, I changed my base charisma and got good drops.
---
The technology isn't there yet.
---
Boiling water grants 1xp on adventure and 2xp on survival (a rounding error I think). Any other crafting is lucrative if you throw in xp modifiers.
---
I can net over 4000xp just doing routine crafting/cooking on survival mode.
---
I think the term griefing is being overexagerated. If I need acid and I want hemlock holes - I will go and take it. If people are their I will fight them until they leave. Is that griefing?  It's a PvP area with resources I want. If you can't defend it why do you get to keep it? Should I have to wait till your done or server hop? There are enough poop sockers out there who would have workshops locked down if we had to take turns occupying them.  Sometimes I will be low on time and low on various resources. I see a group defending a workshop on the map. If I run up and attack once- steal loot and run away. Am I griefing? I call it stealing. Your guard was down and you were robbed. Why people go to a PvP area with so much junk makes no sense. Especially when they know anyone can attack at any time. It's happened to me a couple times and then I learned my lesson. Workshops are too be considered PvP areas. I don't go there unless I am open to fighting.. The other night I robbed someone. On my way out after breaking stuff down and storing it; 2 players rush in to attack. I killed one died to the other but lost 50 caps cause my loot was stored. They ran around shooting at me doing no damage sending taunt emotes trying to get me to fight. I just went on my Merry way to do what I needed junk for ( pacifist now engaged) they got mad and called me a griefer and demanded I fight . After they blocked my shots for a while and followed me around trying to block doors and such I logged off. Who's the griefer? I felt like I was being griefed. When I was robbed I never was left with the impression. I think it should be discussed though. I do agree that there should be a no PvP option but I think it will really be a lackluster experience. that's just my ten cents.
---
Trying the Lady Jane's spawn currently. Fingers crossed!
---
The story line right now has it where everyone got infected. So NPCs wouldn't happen that easily. But if you add them after the storyline is over, then you get to meet them who are struggling out in the wasteland. It would be awesome to welcome them to our camps and make our camp turn into a settlement as it continues to grow like in Fallout 4. The more people and task you complete, the bigger your camp...I mean settlement becomes. You can still relocate but requires more caps and resources. This would cause the settlers to become sad and you have to travel with them until they reach the new location. Then you begin to help rebuild but must make sure you keep everyone content. They will work the same way as your character but on their own AI.

I still can't move or remove my "Hero of Wasteland" statue without moving my camp. Upon placement it was nearly but not quite perfect and my design goal requires that it face EXACTLY west. My dreams of another "hidden" "easter egg" were crushed that day. Crushed I say!
---
edit: Yea camp building is really a pain in the ass compared to what it used to be.
---
/r/fo76filthycasuals. We have a discord.
---
Can confirm this. Did Responders, part of Raiders, then just kinda fell into the Enclave. I actually finished the Brotherhood ~~and Free States~~ before the Raiders too.
---
EDIT: I'm a dumbass, technically you have to do Raiders before Free States because a quest item for the FS comes from Rose.
---
Sorry man, Lead and aluminum are the only things that are reduced in weight - by 50%.
---
Everything else weighs the same amount it did in the beginning you are just loosing the plastic each bulk.
---
But you can get that in game for free. There's several items in the atomic shop for atoms that you can just pick up in game.
---
Same, plus armor &amp; PA. At this rate it's taken so long to get, I'd probably stop playing the character(s) if the clutch gear vanished. There doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason to the disappearances,.
---
Currently it‚Äôs at 64gb
---
Pistols are not so good but if you use 10mm sub you might as well upgrade to rifles.
---
Fireproof rank 2, Adamantium Skeleton 3, and Dense Chest mod. Now, you're invincible.
---
How do you get the broken uplink to finish the first part of free states without completing the Raider questline first?
---
Juicehead doesn't deserve promotion imo. He chose to ride the hate train and fan the flames for personal gain, and now that the game is in a good state he wants to act like he never trashed the game because now it's more profitable for him to make positive content. There are lots of smaller youtubers out there who didn't shit on the game for views and provide much better quality content.
---
Got a Mutant's explosive combat rifle the day it came out.
---
Sadly I only got this one good roll.
---
What system
---
He definitely spawns outside the Toxic Valley, especially in the forest, and at the spot I mentioned south of the Overseer's Camp.
---
Enclave bunker, military wing sells mods. But they're broken too. It won't tell you if it's for limbs or chest :/
---
Don't think they can be learned by scrapping, and as far as I know there aren't plans either.
---
I could be wrong about that, I finished the Enclave way back, right after the BETA, and I did the rest a month or so after. I might have done Raiders before Free States. I really didn't care for either.
---
But yeah, you're right, the uplink comes from Rose.
---
You want them to fix a bug but you dont want to report the bug to them? ü§î
---
I said drop psn (ps4)
---
If you‚Äôre not melee you have to consider ammo. 10, .38, shot, and .45 are the most commonly found. The hunting rifle takes .308 and while at spawns in lower quantities with player vending you can‚Äôt pick up .308 for 1 cap each. 
---
Handmade is great but making 556 is a pain in the ass if your not equipped to farm for the mats. Instead a combination of the lever and combat will give you the damage of the handmade with short to medium range damage both chambered for .45
---
I just said I preferred the 10mm sub over the 10mm pistol, don‚Äôt what‚Äôs wrong with that so much that 2 people have to downvote it

Slavery is evil, no question. (And I'm not the guy from above). 
---
But a lot of historians believe that it wasn't so much about freeing slaves as it was about the north gaining an economic and political advantage over the south. If all of a sudden, your would-be, republican-leaning  (at that time) freed slaves have the right to vote, then you can seriously change the political landscape of the south. 
---
Instead of slaves counting as 3/5ths of a person, they now each count as 1 person. On the surface, that might seem good for getting more house seats for the south. But in reality it means A-LOT of new people voting republican (remember, that was Lincoln's party at the time, and he ran on emancipation). So if you free the slaves, suddenly, in theory, Lincolns party gains a lot more power through freed-slave voters.
---
Aaaaand thats why you had horrible Jim Crow voting "laws", segregation, and gerrymandering during reconstruction. To try and dilute the freed slave vote as much as possible, so that the southern democrats could hold onto their power. 
---
TLDR: Slavery was/is evil, but saying that slavery started the civil war isn't the whole truth. Part of it, but not all of it. The civil war started because two political parties wanted more power than the other, and ending slavery happened to be, very conveniently, a good card for the republicans to play. It being the right thing to do was just the cherry on top. Wether Lincoln or many of the republicans at the time really cared about freeing slaves is debatable. Historically, through letters and journals, many of them genuinely did. But you can't deny that emancipation was, objectively, a power play. 
---
In any case, hopefully we're all thankful emancipation happened... right?
---
Edit: Oh and I forgot to mention, the only reason white farmers back then had insane amounts of money, and therefore power, was because of the free labor from slavery.  So hitting them in their "work force" was also advantageous to the north in that regard. A lot of people died and suffered as slaves, as well as died in the civil war. The whole thing was evil AF. Hopefully we can all agree on that.
---
The only thing the 10mm sub has going for is the fact it uses 10mm ammo and counts for the commando perk. I have a bloodied/Explosive and it‚Äôs a house.
---
That's the only thing I have found so far the forces any one faction to be completed before another. Would love if there was a work around for it so I could do the factions in reverse order just for the hell of it.
---
Double vegetation.

Fair enough üòÇ Donnieboy489
---
Do not level up your %damage perk cards, especially if you want to be a jack of all trades. Rank 2, 3 only grant +5% each, so you'll do +20% with Commando 3. You will get +30% with Commando 1, expert commando 1 and master commando 1.
---
If the marker is not at blackwater mine it means someone has already talked to the robot and when you join you will be inside the mine instead of outside.
---
Maybe the mine is physically located under there.
---
Yeah I use t51 except for nuke zones, and in nuke zones I use rad shield which more than makes up for the reduced rad resistance.
---
what story is behind surgeon mask then?
---
What about when i have both markers in the map??
---
HOPEFULLY THESE GET FIXED SOON. ITS A PAIN IN THE A$$ RIGHT NOW.
---
QoL tips:
---
1) use advanced power conduits to run wires through walls, floors and ceilings. You could turn a section of wall into a door, run the wire through the door then turn it back into a wall.... I have experienced issues with this glitch that cuts power off, says items are intersecting when they aren't and more. Suggest using the built in method of the advanced power conduits.
---
2) hook up vendors to a switch behind locked doors. One of the new griefing methods is to turn your vendors off if on a switch. If it's behind locked doors they can't without becoming wanted... Then you have an open invitation to kill them and take their junk. üòÅ
---
3) If you place a decon shower, put it on a keypad switch and put the code below it. I've had people turn the shower on and leave which stops people running unyeilding, bloodied and/or mutations from entering my camp cause the shower would take their benefits away. Keypad switch auto turns off after a few seconds.

Look for a similar weapon but named oddly. People have had issues with vending items renaming themselves after purchase.

Ah rip

I didn't drop it nor packed it in the stash.
---
Believe me or not - i check the note of Amy Kerry "Amy's Note" and it's not in my stash and as far as i know and did the daily it just vanish after the it's done. 
---
Just a little background - i'm a lore hoarder. Every note, holo goes into the stash and there is nothing.
---
Could be it's a platform thing were it differ but nevertheless - even if the note will fall under the note tab in pip boy - it should go into the same as keys, holo passwords and notes which were undropable

Haven't ever seen plans.  Probably don't exist yet. I tried scrapping a few and got exactly nothing. I didn't even get any scrap from them.
---
This is one of the best ideas I've read !!!
---
Bah given the task given to us with these challenges, I was quite nervous as well when it did this to me. Immediately fast traveled to Camp Adams to check the machines. Heavily relieved!
---
I haven‚Äôt seen anyone sell crimson flux yet
---
Same happened to me, I picked up everything repaired camera created film but never got the quest under data.
---
I‚Äôll try to find one again
---
What about JanSport? Especially if u should be at school but instead playing fallout 76
---
2 markers then idk lol
---
This is a shame. Cuz the armor looks dope af plus base stats are good but my bos is currently better
---
Really? Thank you. It means alot. I thought of it just now.
---
&gt;You use teams, one player contests the workshop in the team while the  other player hunts them down outside of the workshop. The game just  checks if there is at least one person inside the boundry. Otherwise a  workshop owner could stay just outside the boundries and snipe anyone  who tries to take it with impunity.
---
u/Valseek u/Ladydevann
---
There seems to be a bit of a loophole in the fix for workshop PvP.... :(
---
Following
---
Harper's Ferry has a good variety of violet, crimson, fluorescent, yellow and cobalt in that order. Make sure to hit the substation and cabins to the west of it. The Red Rocket to the south spawns mutants, scorched and ghouls that are sometimes legendary. Mama Dolce's is the best for cobalt. Whitesprings has a decent selection depending on where you put it. Lots of fluorescent, yellowcake,  some crimson and cobalt.
---
I'm level 120ish and everytime i do one violent night , guys that are high level or even low level they join i try explaining to them not to constantly keep the music running but they don't cooperate. So what i do i go to where the boss spawns and 1 shot it so they can't loot the legendary.
---
Can it not be in White Springs?  I absolutely despise going there.
---
I‚Äôve only used those I got from the SBQ. It‚Äôs saved me when I was out of repair parts and desperately needed to repair my TS handmade!
---
What's your IGN? I'd be happy to take a look.
---
That would be great  then I could start to sell good legendary weapons instead of scrapping them.
---
People would use them as a second storage and just make everything cost 25k
---
I have pacifist mode on always. They keep shooting and following me around, jumping and doing emojis. I have voice chat off also and now if/when I play I play with no volume at all. I have never been a mulit player guy at all. I did play the original quake online a ton until sniping became "you lame camper" and so I stopped. I even play Left 4 Dead 1 and 2 still, just with bots. If a game comes out like that with no bots able to be used I do not buy it. As a huge fallout fan, this game just is meh, which is fine, it is not my type of game,  a few small changes would fix it for me... though the lore breaking stuff is still annoying but tolerable, lol.
---
Slavery was the key issue that fed tensions leading into war. ‚ÄúBleeding Kansas‚Äù, the Dred Scott decision, the Fugitive Slave Acts...all centered on slavery.
---
Did freeing slaves motivate the North? No, not particularly, which seems to be your point. But I reject that it wasn‚Äôt the core issue (saying ‚Äúeconomics &gt; slavery‚Äù doesn‚Äôt float when the owned-people *were* the Southern economy)
---
What does shutting the music off do?
---
The pipboy dose not say intelligence increases exp but the condition of items plus other stuff but not exp.
---
There's a union hat? My God I must find it.
---
Honestly, if they'd rather use it as storage, fine with me.  They have to give up potential cap income to do it, so it's fairly balanced, IMO
---
If you use the appropriate perks, heavy guns are by far the greatest in the game. They have less mod spots, so less additions onto the weight. Mod weights are calculated by using the raw weapon weight value. 90% weightless isn't considered when applying the mods, so you'll notice your weight shoot up quickly.
---
Heavy weapons have the fewest drawbacks (weight, ammo and handling) and each is easily circumvented with proper perks and attachments.
---
Rifles will overtake them for best weapon class when the weight reduction perk for rifles is released.
---
Has happen since beta. No biggie
---
Then they should try to increase the stash limit to 1000 that would make everyone happy.
---
exactly!  Some of the nicer drops go completely to waste because the person who gets them can't use it, and doesn't want to give up the stash space on the off chance SOMEONE wants it enough to pay for it
---
Bethesda was thinking ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre gonna alert the enemies of your presence you mind as well do it in style.‚Äù
---
Agreed, ish. But I think the devs put references to the civil war, automation, and government acting outside the interests of the people in order to start a discussion. A discussion that unfortunately got over-shadowed by bugs and people freaking out over repair kits.
---
If you don't let the music run , waves of ghouls will keep spawning making it a good legendary farm. So event is 25mins you turn the music on and off for 20mins ish and once event is about to run out of time play an instrument and turn the music on to make the boss spawn.
---
Do you recall if you were able to get shadowed that way?
---
I'm having a great time in Survival. Lots of tension, more exploration due to limited fast travel and I've had fun battles with people that last beyond the first shot. Keep in mind, I have built for PvP and do my best to be in position during fights. If you intend on bringing a maximum carry weight build and stand still in a road during fights, prepare to be roadkill.
---
Tazier2 is my vendor account.
---
I got a mega sloth like two days ago
---
Allowing you to transfer your character over means a permanent no from me on survival mode. No clue why they went with this option.
---
I most certainly do not want that.
---
I got a furious + explodey + -25% vats cost. Used with concentrated fire I loved it so much I respeced to commando rather than rifleman. The ammo is a pita though. Yes it is easy to make only requiring steel but come on 5 at a time really.
---
I really want to prime it for that little extra kick.
---
So that squirrel on a stick is being fed to me stick and all? I suppose it adds much needed roughage. :)
---
Cryptid event is your best bet. That‚Äôs where I got it.
---
What timezone are you? Myself and one of the others on this thread are going to meet up at about 7 or 8am BST (11pm or midnight PST) to do it if you want to join us.
---
If BST timezone I can drop on to help at most reasonable hours :)
---
Spawns more ghouls. Keep event rolling and hope legendaries spawn. Problem with all these strategies are not only that people don't know them, it is also that not everyone can do 30min of gameplay for one event.
---
This mechanic has been present since fallout 1. The more you know.
---
Um... Look at the first page of your pip boy and do a little math...
---
It's easy to not know it. It is easy to not have the time to farm the spawns.
---
Only people who got the rare ones were those who cheated and got into the dev rooms as far as I know.  Something about the odds of getting the rare ones legitimately was so low they didnt register or something like that.  Maybe next Fasnacht =)
---
I did not know that, thank you.
---
/u/Valseek  /u/Ladydevann Can you folks please pass on that this weapon is missing a prime automatic option?
---
Hopefully next time.
---
Ha, each to their own but you are a survivor after all. Needs must
---
Tried to clarify in my edit. But I'm also not the best at being a history nerd.
---
I would like to post signs. Just like those Minecraft signs
---
You have the ability to report players. They can't do anything to you after that.
---
I play other games at times but Fallout 76 is my favorite of all time.
---
The tick is also in the game, I have all 11 of them.
---
Aw I'm a CST pleb so thatd be like 1 am for me. Appreciate the info but I dont think I can participate. Best of luck
---
Wait that's a real thing?
---
If you want crazy defense MAKE SURE to invest into home defense
---
I‚Äôm now level 70 and realizing I need those to make better turrets
---
I did that and the weapon changed its name to my T51b PA. So I had to rename it back to a gun name. Thought I lost it. Check at the weapons workbench to make sure what you have.
---
I've grinded (ground?) campfire tales and the 2 daily quests for my badges. Not so bad other than the fact the "story of the day" in campfire tales doesn't change every day
---
And whats with the other backpack from the shop, the yellow one with the chest, does it show it as well on its back?
---
Ha. Can't imagine defending a workshop from players with turrets, does it scale in PVP? I doubt it.
---
Vats and 10mm pistols can be pretty nasty. They have low ap consumption and high dps. The smg is nice because it works with commando perks. Both have the uses.
---
Go to West Tek, kill the super mutant outside and inside
---
Server hop and repeat.
---
Stash your aid and junk and Do it in survival for 20% XP bonus 
---
Get well rested bonus plus some cranberry relish or cobbler for extra XP boost.
---
You‚Äôre good. Would be happy to hear your point of view via PM
---
I almost just bought that but it sits too far up on the back. Feel like the shovel will be constantly banging into my head
---
It will .. they all do I‚Äôm just saying that the shovel one actually matches with the outfit
---
What time BST do you play? If its not a crazy hour my end I'm happy to hop on to help you out. Looks like you are 6 hours behind me.
---
Depends, it is a lot more intense, first month was basically a deathmatch. Is it the FO76 chill and have fun experience? Nope, it's pins and needles all the time, some people love it and good for them to have that game ode.
---
Yep found one in fort defiance just laying on the floor no bag no box no nothing just laying there..
---
Xbox as well..
---
Lmfao
---
Aaronholt seems also an interesting location for flux only.
---
Yeah, I really like your appreciation and not straight up downvote my reply because you don‚Äôt agree with my opinion. üëçüèª
---
Nope, not a bug. Hopefully they eventually add some way to add stars to crafted weapons because this and other sheep weapons desperately need them. Probably not, as it would make it easier to toss things for Mole Mama
---
Hah funny read, thanks:)
---
Bethesda didn't make eso. Different team. Bethesda doesn't benefit from anything eso did/does.
---
Does wearing the backpack count as clothing?
---
Making one yes, but don‚Äôt get your hopes up to buy one.
---
My husband and I immediately decided we had to have one in real life. We spent time searching online and finally found an almost identical version - the only version to exist, really - just to find out it was a famous proof of concept design that was made but never mass produced. We were super bummed. At least the metal modular houses in F4 actually existed.
---
I‚Äôll get the link from him later if you‚Äôre curious to see it looked like in real life. I forgot what it was called.
---
Lol I'm wondering the same thing myself. Got a FE with - vats cost a few days ago from the Legendary vendor. Just recently hit level 160 and never used a railway rifle at all before now in 76.
---
Totally high risk, high reward build. I enjoy it as well. Makes PvE content much more challenging. You should try Survival! It's frustrating at times but in the end you become a better player.
---
Edit: If PC I'll go with you.
---
Some helpful tips from someone who did NOT want to stay in the Forest:
---
- Try to use at least 1 piece of camoflage/steath gear and sneak around whenever you're near enemies too strong for you. 
---
- Run away from fights you know you'll lose. A lot of time if you get far enough away and hide out of their line of sight, they'll lose you. Otherwise they do give up *eventually* but they'll still chase for a LONG time.
---
- If you're near other people's camps, train stations, or stumble across a Stash box (at camps a Stash box can be a dresser, garbage, etc. - any container is a Stash in someone's camp), dump your loot so you don't lose it if you die.
---
- Go to your camp occasionally to empty you stash and break it all down to components that weight less, then dump back into stash.
---
- If things are getting tight and you're near a Workshop, take the workshop. Most of them have buildings or other hiding spots within the bounds and you can capture the workshop by holding the Build Mode button anywhere in the boundary, you don't have to use the actual workbench. Take advantage of a safe spot like an enclosed room, etc. Build yourself a workbench if you have enough mats and built a stash box. Scrap everything, repair any good armor/weapons, dump stuff in your stash.
---
I had explored ALL over the map before I ever hit level 50. LOTS of exploring as a level 20-something in areas I had no business being in, but I loved exploring. You do still die a lot, but like other folks have mentioned there's no negative to dying except dropping your Junk (in Adventure mode you don't lost Aid items or ammo or anything else when you die). And if you've explored a lot, you can just respawn at the nearest location to your death and run back to collect the stuff you dropped.
---
I remain suspicious that the LUCK Special Stat affects RNG for this purpose, as well as frequency of legendary enemies... not enough of a #s geek to be able to test. (but my 8 luck character has much better gear than my 1 luck character #anecdotaldata)
---
This bullshit is why we need to see some form of in-game feedback on the damage we're doing. Good work OP.
---
Yeah they could do with running this event again. Must be lots of newbs who haven't played it.
---
I don‚Äôt think they should add stars to those necessarily. I just don‚Äôt get why we can only apply the skin to non legendary heads only when obviously everyone who has it would much rather use a legendary version, which exists, to show it off.
---
I just keep server hopping until I find one without these types of players or just quit in annoyance. If I reported everyone that did this, it would easily be over 300 players. lol
---
Surgeon mask doesnt protect from airborne disease. Its a cosmetic like the plague doctor mask.
---
600 once made everyone happy. Then 800...
---
The vendor thing kinda messed with the 800 though.
---
Did you change the batteries?
---
Maybe turn it off an back on?
---
Otherwise go to RobCo and try get a refund.
---
Thats where my over abundance helps. I sell masks at my shop for fair pricing. About 500 each owl is 750 and the beret 1k.
---
Yeah at this point it's just a decorative paper weight
---
That is not true. The rare masks were not in the game when people were exploiting the dev room, and the dev room has been completely removed from game code now. So there must have been some legit drops of the rare masks.
---
They have always been around. I died of laughter when I got a Double Double Barrel Shotgun.
---
Legendary scorched seem to be extremely rare.
---
I run unyielding because it boosts everything except endurance. That's good, right?
---
Got these in Finland?
---
Existed since beta.
---
Awesome! I even had fun reading this post, made me feel excited to play the game buuuut there is that O.N.E bug that ruins your fun so much that you close the game and play it again after an hour.
---
Nah, it exists alongside Quad because Quad replaced Never-Ending from FO4 for F76, so we get both
---
Which bug?
---
Sorry, had to drop to deal with some sudden issue for work - but thanks for letting me browse
---
20% of 307HP I'm @ 60HP
---
307/x=100/20  
---
(307/x)\*x=(100/20)\*x  
---
307=5\*x  
---
307/5=x   
---
61.4=x   
---
x=61.4  
---
20% of 307=61.4  
---
there is no way I'm going to enter my pip boy and do math while I'm fighting a mob of Super Mutants, but yes that will give me the answer.
---
A nice quick and easy % number next to my health bar would be favourite. I can't understand why this is even a thing it's so bleedingly obvious.
---
Doesn‚Äôt have to be a specific bug, any bug could be that one bug I talked about. Even the RNG could make me mad
---
Oh fair enough
---
In the collectors guide there is a mention about own robots somewhere but i have to look it up again.
---
I mean it could be - there are more things in the guide which were implemented a while after release.
---
You can make this higher if you place your camp higher.
---
This analysis is worth a good read when it comes to scout armor. I‚Äôve picked up a bunch of decent pieces from the purveyor and found it very helpful, better than any article. 
---

---
:/  That's exactly what happened.  It's listed as a duplicate of something else I'd renamed instead of what it actually is.  Thank you very much; still a bug, but no where near as breaking of one.
---
Yes I know it's been in past fallout been playing since 3 but I have not seen a difference in exp gain depending on points in intelligence. I have also watched plenty of fallout 76 videos on builds and maximizing exp gain and non of them have said intelligence gives extra exp. Even the fallout 76 guide book says nothing about this.
---
Inventory is in a database. The game‚Äôs server side client talks to this database to get player inventories and pass them to the game client console side. 
---
It‚Äôs not unfeasible to use a second, light weight server client that can talk to the same database for the purposes of simple inventory queries. 
---
Since it‚Äôs read only, database collisions/race conditions shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. 
---
Not advocating they should do it. But it‚Äôs not impossible as you make it out to be.
---
Todd Howard doing some daily challenges. Thats what i really want to see.
---
Everything else is optional but welcome.
---
It's still 110% garbage after quest completion IMO. Was a fun quest though.
---
You could do a bloodied build and get this effect
---
Playing now and usually anytime during the day(CST) since I'm still recovering from having 4 wisdom teeth taken out. So like 3 am to 3 PM BST I'd have no problem getting on quickly
---
I had the same problem. On a random desperate hunch I had my partner leave the team and destroy a floating lone wall that would not store or scrap. When it was totally destroyed, it would finally scrap. But I don‚Äôt know if you can do that anymore with all the changes.
---
Happens to me too.
---
I'll hop on now, IGN?
---
So basically it‚Äôs like politics now in a simplistic nutshell? Like how all of the major left wing candidates promise amnesty and free stuff for the mass wave of Mexican/South American immigrants? 
---
They claim it‚Äôs for the ‚Äúgood‚Äù of the immigrants but the leftist leaders don‚Äôt give a flying fuck about anything but the votes they‚Äôll rake in by making everyone citizens. Basically cheating.
---
At least back then the left wing version AKA Lincoln actually cared about people. But then again slavery was much more serious than border hopping
---
You're a life saver. Its Ununoctium118
---
F Juicehead.
---
I will try this! Thanks.
---
Yes that would also mean the return of the dogs ;__;
---
There are set spawns for some of the games
---
Seems like it‚Äôs about 80% bloodied/unyielding 10% anti armor /sent/cav and 10% whatever you can get your hands on.
---
Ah how useless
---
Campfire Tales is repeatable in a day. Stings and Things and Operation Tidy are both dailies. They reset each day at the same time Biv does.
---
The whole purpose of Vault 76 was to rebuild America. What is going on in Vault 51 is completely different and in order to continue the quest of rebuilding America, one must wonder if dealing with the events of Vault 51 is part of that (since there is a really big suggestion towards that if you find a certain body is a certain area of The Forest). 
---
Also, it's totally optional. I'm personally excited, but I also don't participate in must Events because I just personally don't want to. It's that easy.
---
Okay. I dont follow him like that
---
It does protect.  I get the message that it is protecting me.
---
I think only Grognak, at the Grafton dam.
---
Ohhhh, THAT bug lmao
---
I have all 8 of them yes.
---
anytime
---
Bloodied + Explosive for ranged.
---
Bloodied + Swing Speed for melee.
---
For armor it's unyielding +  still Sentinel/Cavalier's, but the nerf (effect of Sentinel/Cavalier's works 75% of the time now) has made it significantly less irritating to play against.
---
Yup my alt (lvl120) has all the pipboy games, highly recommend playing grognak and the ruby ruins and wastelad they are both fantastic games.
---
Need a place to die which has shallow water and enemies not too high level to kill me instantly. Ideas?
---
wrong. I can confirm it protects you. at least one that is not from the atom shop.
---
Edit: and i just bought smile mask. It protects you too
---
Also Atomic Command at Big Bend East I believe. I've found 3 there.
---
I have a Double Double Barrel I keep it around for giggles.
---
Yes, I‚Äôve been seeing this recently. Only on my equipped weapon, others in my inventory aren‚Äôt effected.
---
Adding some events to suggestions below-
---
"One Violent Night" - Listen for "Sons of Dane" broadcast. The event wants you to play music to attract the Nightstalker... Don't do this. Start the jukebox to get meter bar to appear, then TURN IT OFF. Ghouls will spawn in waves until the timer runs out. Farm the ghouls until you have less than 5 minutes (out of a possible 28 minutes(?)) turn it back on unless the bar is already maxing. With Well rested perk, inspirational (team up!!!) and some of the other suggestions below, it's a very quick bump in XP.  If you are feeling frisky afterwards, pop down the road to the North a bit to Hopewell Cave, Wake the resident inside, walk back out and wake the Sierra Bravo and his buddies across the street.
---
"Uranium Fever" - it's been hit or miss lately, (more players usually equals more miners). As an added bonus, if you have the scrapper perk, the miners drop a ton of shotguns. I've picked up 700-800 steel in one event on occasion (+ XP). Don't forget to check the side tunnel for more miners...  and hit the Rad Shower in the entryway afterwards for a free scrub.
---
(the Low level version of this for me has been hitting the Grafton Steel mill/workshop, lots and lots of level 5-10 mutants...) 
---
\[Pro-tip for once you get comfy in Death from Above/SBQ fight... focus on the mobs for XP.   
---
(No, I'm not suggesting not contributing to the event, as I believe keeping those Scorched Conquerors from chewing on everyone is a valid contribution)\]
---
I'm at Spruce Knob, area looks clear of enemies
---
I think with how slow camps have been loading, especially with fast travel to a vendor and the camp not loaded at all that they are going to push this one back much later
---
Screw more stash limit enough will never be enough for most what we need is more space for pictures just love loading screens from pics I took
---
Me
---
I and many others have had this issue. It took me multiple tries. Logged in one day and it finally let me scrap the part I was having issues with.
---
Timeline wise, wouldn‚Äôt it be ‚ÄúPrototype: Spray and Pray‚Äù?
---
The F4 version would come after the one you now have.
---
Yup everytime.. if you quick change to another gun and then back it should be reloaded.. or you can reload it
---
\*IS\* the dev room gone? I went by a camp two days ago which had the flame-design power armor station that just unlocked, for example.  
---
(There's also someone with a camp WAY out of bounds in the top left corner of the map. I see it flicker in from time to time, but I've never been able to get there.)
---
Great thanks
---
I was playing rdr2 and simply floated off my horse mid ride about 30ish feet up for like 10 seconds and then dropped to my death. 
---
The only thing I could think was I‚Äôm glad fallout doesn‚Äôt have horses üòÇ
---
Bethesda fixed this in a patch several months ago, bulking now properly decreases weight for every junk item.
---
The bog is best for crimson (diseased cranberries everywhere) and violet (mutated ferns, also everywhere), but sucks for the other materials needed to make stable flux. Plus maybe a scorched beast there to kill and some stable flux from that. 
---
Whitesprings is best for fluorescent (in front of the cabins and the clubhouse) and crimson (near the entrance to the resort) plenty of cobalt too (mostly along the road between the resort and the train station and in the woods around the super mutant camp) . Probably best for the other materials to craft stable flux. 
---
Harpers ferry is pretty good all around ... but not as good as the first two. Also very good for stable flux crafting materials (especially with the Burroughs).
---
Certain areas in the divide are loaded with cobalt and yellowcake. (Firecracker berries and black berries respectively). Crapshoot on flux crafting mats.
---
There are probably nice areas elsewhere, but these are pretty tried and true.
---
sadly
---
&gt;I also cannot add additional stairs to the construction since everything shows "cannot build in water"
---
The email I got when I submitted the ticket in January said ‚ÄúPlease allow 4-6 months for manufacturing and delivery‚Äù, which falls right around now (latest should be the end of July, given that replacement request window ended Jan 31).  I‚Äôm going to be keeping a close eye out and maybe sending another ticket if there‚Äôs no word in the next few weeks.
---
The Walking Cane is kinda trash, the level 20 unmodded Drill is where it‚Äôs at.
---
How the the leaderboard work?
---
Thanks :)
---
How is this any different than just increasing STASH limit?  If vending machines had their own separate STASH what happens when someone fills their machine full of stuff and then stores the vending machine?
---
True yes my god I did not even think of that lol
---
Scout armor plans do not exist.
---
The COBJ records are not set up to enable learning mods from scrapping.
---
The ARMO records are missing the keyword that would allow for attachment of slot-specific linings (aerodynamic, braced, brawling, stabilised, weighted for upper limbs, cushioned, custom fitted, sleek for lower limbs), conversely it allows for muffled to be attached to upper limbs (should be lower limb specific).
---
Have not checked if Torso specific linings (asbestos, biocommesh, dense, padded, pneumatic) will attach.
---
The 'attachment' issue is shared by the robot armor upper limbs.
---
This was reported in early December; it was deemed 'low hanging fruit' and not a priority to fix even though is, literally, a ten minute fix with zero chance of 'collateral damage'.
---
EDIT: bear in mind that MODUS only lists three mods for sale at a time so be ready to server hop ;)
---
Fortunately they do not seem to be 'weighted' like the PA mods so it won't be yet another jetpack/shocks/stealth boy scenario.
---
It‚Äôs ruined it for me and it‚Äôs my alt gun for robots only.
---
Why are people not just using the Encryptid Event to complete this? Just join the event and hang out by the pylons and wait for somebody to go down. Its like shooting fish in a barrel.
---
Really? Thank you, this has been confusing topic when no-one seemed to have the exacct answer what this is about
---
Thank you. This seems to be the right answer.  Under the storage settings on my PS4, the installed/updated game is around that number.  Just needing to know how they split that difference between disc and updates. Now I know!
---
Slavery is bad but the north started the war....
---
You should be able to get your plastic back when scrapping bulk items but not when using them. It would solve the issue for the most part.
---
Oh S'mores it drops 100% I've sold a few myself.
---
The hotrod stuff was in the game for a limited time months ago.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/acossu/psa_1_day_only_hot_rodder_paints_and_power_armor/

Crouch, everywhere you go.
---
THIS. Also more variety would be nice
---
Yep
---
Vault 63 is also a reference to the year West Virginia joined the union after seceding Virginia in 1863.
---
Alright, so I played with this for a bit. The world looks *great.* The metal textures are affected too much, though, which is too bad. Why can't there be a happy medium? ARGH. haha
---
That'd be great if I was higher level, but I'm at 26 right now so +30 is the most until I level up some.
---
So gather up good gear and travel light?
---
There is a currently confirmed (by you, and others) bug wherein you can only respawn at the Vault when over-encumbered. You MAY be able to respawn at a friend, if they're on the same server. I could speculate on the cause, but mostly, I was just curious.
---
Alright, thanks for letting me know. I had the impression you could do them more than once per day.
---
Sent u a rq
---
I have a question I heard that prices were bugged where the game gets 90% and you get 10% idk if this is true but could someone shed some light on this?
---
Those games both continuously release new content.

Well I hadn't even started Lyin' Lowe yet and hadn't seen the event appear on the times I was playing else I would.  I agree this is a good place to get the revive, as the water around the event is a two-fer!
---
Do they still advertise a ‚Äúcanvas bag‚Äù?  I would hope they‚Äôd at least have wised up and stopped the false advertising if they‚Äôre still producing them.
---
I've been renaming weapons and armour as "Sell" so it's nice and easy when I finally get to a vendor
---
It has been removed from the worldspace in thr game code itself.
---
The Atom shop items are not available in the dev room anyway, and the Hotter Rod paint for the PA station was also previously available in the store. The CAMP thing could be some other glitch and there's no reason to assume it's related to the devroom. Entering the dev room had nothing to do with camps anyway. It involved using a gameshark like cheat engine to modify game files to spawn you directly into the dev room when you load the game. Hence Bethesda's warning of the game being in a "corrupt state" when dev room cheaters were caught.
---
will do
---
Yup, I believe the wiki still shows the old, incorrect weights for the bulked junk, haven't checked in several weeks though.
---
Yeah, I think it's more of a preference at this point. I prefer Enlighten being set to 0 for now. Hopefully Bethesda will address the issue and implement some well-needed lighting fixes.
---
Haven't tried this but will check it out. Still a nuisance. If I forget to reload I'm gunna forget to swap lol
---
Do you find them in certain locations?
---
Can we get some ladders or spiral stairs as options? There is 1 stair that takes an *entire foundation* of space to use. The only other options are the 1x2 platforms with integrated stairs and those are so buggy they are almost **dangerous** to use in a camp build.
---
I love the game, just dont want to see it die because they are "saving content for later".
---
Are they random or did you find them in set locations?
---
I agree I think it‚Äôs a solid idea. I wish the galleria on the east side of the map had vendors inside it.
---
Cool. Just thought people got it already and i just somehow missed it or something.
---
High capacity mod.
---
I've noticed 0 difference in my survivability
---
I have a cliff next to my base and every time I fall off I only loose like 1/5 of my health
---
I might have bird bones though, idk
---
I'm using a quad, explosive, -vats cost and its godly.
---
There is a movement speed cap, however they do appear to be able to  mitigate the -speed penalty from being over-encumbered.
---
I've never actually seen a player wearing a confederate uniform in all my time playing. I guess no one wants to play as a bunch of failed traitors.
---
There was one guy on PS4 that legitimately got the old man winter mask. He is on multiple market groups and his friends are too. They all said he got the drop. I joined up just to see it. Never seen anyone with any of the others in person.
---
Points. You get them for everything but killing players moves you up fast.
---
On a busy server i can do my own thing for about2 hrs. Then i get close to top 3 (game shows location of top 3) and i have to kill my self to go back to the bottom.
---
Also i just killed 3 ppl in a row at or above lvl 150 and im at lvl20.
---
My Somerset 44 is riping thru these guys and plasma nades help lol. Its not op weapons like everyone crys about. Everything feels more deadly.
---
It's true that PVP combat is not balanced but for all the reasons outlined by this post I find survival to be the superior and far more satisfying mode. I often play as a low level character and have essentially no chance PVP wise against the majority of players on the server but don't find "griefing" to be an issue as avoiding players is not too difficult and a big part of the fun. The fact that you are not always visible on the map means there is no issue of being harassed by higher level players. I highly recommend more players who's main reason for avoiding survival is "griefing" to give it more of a go, the mode is so much more than just a PVP deathmatch grief fest.
---
Achievements/Trophies obtained during BETA will not count. It was said before the beta.
---
Lincoln said ‚Äú if I could free all the slaves and stop the war I would, but if I could free none of the the slaves and stop the war I would do that also......
---
The war was fought for many reasons ... slavery, states rights, and control....
---
Personally I think the new stalker outfit is the best in game so far better than the longcoat and this you need to pay for so not likely you going to see many wearing it
---
So I‚Äôd have to make a new character to unlock?
---
I decided to try it passively and hit every SBQ fight that popped hoping to revive someone there.  Turns out I am not the only one with this idea, or we are all so helpful, since I missed the first 3 or 4 revives being too slow.
---
Finally got it! Burned thousands of 5.56 rounds but there were some good battles.
---
Little bit of both. Here's a link for Mappalachia, there might be a list of holotape spawns. http://imgur.com/a/4Js8sCY
---
+10 health and 90% weight reduction isn't any better then extra damage to robots or more damage the less dr you have
---
Talk about rare.
---
I'm sorry to break it to you bud but the weight savings on all but the ones I've mentioned are due to the plastic you spend on bulking them, which you don't get back. Much like the other guy said.
---
Check it out for yourself and do the math.
---
Yup
---
Yes. Since they would be early game trophies they should be very easy to get.
---
I see four there every time I go.
---
Right thanks for clearing that up
---
Luckily the beginning stuff doesnt take too long and afterwards you can use the character for extra storage. I still need a level 10 character so :/
---
Cool. Hey, our factions may be at war, but I‚Äôd commit treason for you.
---
Just got back into the game after playing a few hundred hours. Kinda wish I started the quest before attempting the new paradise falls stuff because I revived 2 ppl there.
---
I know I‚Äôm a little late here, but any idea if everyone who requested a replacement would have received that email?  Because I haven‚Äôt gotten anything even containing the word ‚ÄúBethesda‚Äù since Blades went live....
---
I have a quad double barrel (my BOOMSTICK) I keep it around for making things die.
---
Resolute Veteran
---
Debatable, but if we are just talking about damage, the unique Heavy mod on All-Rise is definitely better all-around damage.
---
That‚Äôs an asshat move
---
Definitely send a link or name if you can find it!
---
I had no idea it had any basis in the real world...even if it was only a proof of concept though, that gives me waaaaay more hope we can some day make a project of this. :D
---
Is this supposed to mean something?
---
Okay. The leaderboard sounds annoying. Can you leave the lobby and join the new one?
---
Yup.  It should be altered to work like the wasteland hero statue, activation by interacting with it.
---
Bird bones, acrobat legendary, goat legs perk... try it with a new character, you may have forgotten the difference all your legendaries, perks, and mutations make ;)
---
That‚Äôs what No Man‚Äôs Sky and it sure was more successful than ever. People still hate saun maurry
---
Hell they could go a historical route and add mods to make it like the WW2 Sturmpistole, German flare gun modified to shoot different kinds of grenades. This could lead to a lightweight use for the 40mm grenade (yes the caliber isn't right but still) with variants for each grenade type (plasma, cryo, pulse)
---
Hope you learned your lesson
---
Could I get something else cleared up, someone told me vending machines were broke as in the game takes 90% of the money and you get 10% is this true?
---
Yep or just die and you go to the bottom of the list.
---
From what I‚Äôve seen lately on the markets Xbox and pc have been heavily duped. Seen multiple old man winters for sale from the same guy. 
---
Still haven‚Äôt seen any for PS4 though.
---
So why not hustle your behind off and generate some caps to affors an armor set? Youre on reddit right now...the best place to find armor. 
---
FYI, all the fancy armor in the world doesn't protect against a vats head shot. Do yourself a favor and try it.
---
why would you do that?
---
I have 100 percent seen a guy with old man winter on Xbox. I had to double take, because in over 700 I hadn't seen it. Definitely at least 1 on Xbox. I also heard on here they got duped and are not as rare anymore.
---
They were my friends
---
But you lose all your stuff?
---
They were playing with me for several days
---
This happens to me almost every time i log into the game
---
I usually jusy give the game a minute to load before i do anything and then everything is good
---
Well that's why I said at least try and kill things and if it's with his group of players I'm sure no one minds. I had a few lower levels my last run, I didnt really mind I just asked then to run into c and collect all the glowing plants so they did help a little at least. Honestly was better since it spawned more stags to harvest.
---
Level 220 and never seen a double prefix ever but I knew they existed
---
Grognak is always in the Grafton dam.
---
Duping is killing the market. Hope it gets fixed soon.
---
It's always been there. Legendary effects aren't meant to be equally balanced, so all you can do is feel sad and scrip it. But that particular roll isn't the *worst* I've ever seen.
---
Yes. I noticed the ramp up in difficulty. That's why I'm doing it with friends who have the similar goal. If they're all not feeling like to do it then we just skip it and put a dime in a jar.
---
But that's not the point of this topic. Free atoms can be obtained through a lot of things, not just from the "impossible" daily challenges. Craft 76 grenades, Scrap X, Y, Z. etc. And they're easy. If you can transfer those easy atoms from mule accounts to your main account then you basically don't have to purchase atom.
---
Gifting someone by transferring atom / stuffs from your account to friend's account isn't the way. Atom's gift card would be a better way.
---
I guess
---
You need adrenal reaction and nerd rage, sneak all damage boosters available for cards, I just have one lvl into better sneak up to you if you want, combat BE is okay lever action in my eyes is the best for a bloodied sneak range but some say handmade
---
It was only the last three times based on the shift in loot and mobs. I was getting inpatient and probably not waiting long enough.
---
I actually dont have any problems. The way I play is perfect for how I play. To suggest that the way you prefer to play makes my method wrong, is just...well...incorrect.  I happen to do just fine with the way I go, although I would like to cut back on the hoarding of junk.
---
By your comment I'm assuming you have several different types of characters you play, which tells me you're too far involved in the game then I care to be.  My character being more rounded, or stacked in certain areas works just fine for me.  I dont have several different characters from which to build certain perks in a way to make them dominate in their speciality.
---
Sorry for your losses but I mean you kind of deserved it being that naive.  Lesson learned never drop anything for anybody for any reason.
---
The level 50 Backpack has +60. There is a High Capacity mod (8 Merit Badges) that adds +120 carry weight but has a -60 Energy and Radiation resistance. The Camp Adam Event, Camp Fire Tales (happens every in game night) can reward Badges. The two missions you did to get Tadpole, Pickup Waste and the Bug One can be repeated daily and can also reward badges.
---
Not supporting their rebellion or anything, but personally I think most people just prefer the look of the union uniform. At the bare minimum the union outfit includes a backpack while the confederate doesn‚Äôt. Before backpacks were added, it was one of only a handful of outfits to include a decorative pack.
---
I would think, the same thing that happens to our stash if we ever scrap our stash box.  it's just a link to the "storage" that beth gives us, it's a simple change, although yea, logically it's a bit odd, but so is a flying bat with a scorched plague, so I'm not worried about the logic, personally
---
Search all folders including junk.
---
there's a cap?  I must not be taking enough pictures yet...
---
Junk (like in adventure mode) and some aid. Most ppl just put away a lot of your food and stims. Keep like 2 of everything and its no different then adventure mode.
---
Your not loosing guns or ammo or anything other then stims and water mostly. Just stay away from trains and you can get along pretty well without fighting other players. Make frequent trips to stash boxes and turn off pacifist mode(in case you have to fight back) and turn off your vendors. (Dont want ppl spwning on your base.
---
It comes and goes. It did this back in 2018, wasn't an issue the first few months of this year (for me at least) then 9.5 reintroduced it.
---
My favorite station is whispering because it has a tinker bench there already and its so close to Uranium Fever.
---
Damn. Talk about playing the long game...
---
I been looking for Rpers and or Rp communities for the longest to get me back into this game.
---
It protects. And it shouldn't.
---
Level 1 Mr Handy buzz blades and wood armor.   
---
But seriously bloodied is the best horse in this race, though some people are running Junkies builds, or even berserkers with good ranged gear.
---
Dropped two anti pers mines at window Myron airport where two level 12 griefers were hitting me with power sledges I accepted the bounties and sat in corner they came at me and flash both gone
---
I did not know that, thanks. I thought it had something to do with the animals because it's the only time you see the verdant variety.
---
Nah, it does. Never would have known, except I wandered into the ash waste, forgot to put on my gas mask, and never had any concerns.
---
Which... makes it OP. No PER loss, no penalties at all.
---
What system?
---
‚ÄúLike my mom used to say: ‚Äúyou can never have too much ammo‚Äù
---
Well, dude, that sucks. Time to start over with a bit of knowledge
---
Pumpkins can be grown, you just gotta find the plan for it.
---
Okay so just to clarify: if you die, what do you lose?
---
Also being on pacifist means people can still attack you?
---
The only heavy gun I ever really bother to use is the laser Gatling.  Mainly because I have so many power cores from which to power it, but it's also the only weapon I have found to be able to take down SBs when I'm by myself.
---
The mini-gun is alright, but I never have it AND enough ammo at the same time. I either find a crap load of 5mm and no mini-gun or a mini-gun and no ammo.  I store all the 5mm I get in hopes of finding a use for it later, but timing never works out.
---
I also mod the few weapons I have in a way that increases its effectiveness but also keeps down the weight.  But since I generally roam the game by myself, I'm usually ok with having a slightly heavier rifle or gauntlet that I can use.
---
Yea I‚Äôm trying to find some groups as well
---
But I have an ultracite Gatling plasma that uses ultracite plasma cores that require yellow flux to create. I mean I could be wrong, I‚Äôll check again. üò¨
---
Plus crop outdoors get ravaged by pretty much everything.  Let us have a greenhouse (without glitches)
---
What system do u play on? If u r on Xbox I can try to rebuild your X-01 once I get my hands on a chassis. I‚Äôm not on atm but I‚Äôm sure I will be in a few.
---
That‚Äôs another issue all together.
---
yes but we can build a nuke tossing catapult from tin cans and plant goo I'm pretty sure I can put a air filter in a old mask at this point
---
Huh, the atom shop surgical smile mask doesnt do this.
---
I have the old man winter mask bought from a vendor tho never seen anyone else with one
---
So OMW is the only rare one people have.
---
Yes please! I'm in a mothman cult RP group and all I really have is a sleeping bag, a poster, the statue, and then raider stuff... candles are a nice touch tho
---
Can‚Äôt blame you for trusting people. This is whole new lvl grief for me. 
---
What platform mate? I might have something you like
---
I keep hearing about bloodied being the new meta and I‚Äôve never actually seen anything bloodied in game yet. What‚Äôs the perk associated with it?
---
All of your junk (just like normal) and some aid. I had 10 stims on me and when i died i lost maybe 3 and 2 cans of food and waters.
---
Pacifist just means YOU can't hurt others... But they can hurt you.
---
Useful if you co op and dont want to kill your new friend in adventure mode. But in survival its just too risky. Takes too long to flip it on and off. Leave it off and be ready to spay down a mofo.
---
It‚Äôs not a clip it‚Äôs a magazine!
---
Do you remember where the tick drops?
---
Not anymore. I run iron fist maxed and my deathclaw gets 328 damage while my meat hook gets 238.
---
Both have the xtra mod so its apples and apples.
---
It's an event called Lode Bearing I believe at one of the adbandon mine shafts in the South Western part of map. It shakes when the event starts. 
---
You have a time limit to collect as many ores inside the mine as well as keep three robots alive while ghouls, scorch or mole miners attack them.
---
You get tokens at the end of event for a reward outside in a machine
---
Telling what? That people generally conform to a meta build in a video game? Shocker.
---
You using one build doesn't mean you are automatically justify your complaint about your personal issues when you die. I browse this subreddit frequently and have yet to see a complaint like yours. At least not since the earlier days of the game.
---
Also, I didn't use niche to describe your build, I used meta for that. Niche was to describe your problems, as it seems only you and allegedly a handful of others suffer from these "bugs."
---
Poor moo-moo!
---
You should really reevaluate yourself when you type words like "slavery is evil, but..."
---
Your post attempts to rationalize opposition to emancipation in the south but by stating that treating black people as human had collateral consequences. What a joke. Slavery was the driving and unstoppable force behind the civil war. Every other dreamt up alternative reason is closely related to that central issue.
---
Try getting your luck as high as you can. I have a friend who swears by this. I don't know myself but ... unyielding armor, day tripper, awesome possum bacon, and happy go lucky ... is worth a shot. Je has pretty good rng though.
---
Good luck.
---
I'm here too! PSN jscarr996 if any of you want to add me for the fall in water challenge!
---
No it‚Äôs not, they take 10%, you get 90%.
---
Oh did they fix it in the last update?
---
Totally agree! This is what i have been waiting for
---
I'm so happy they out the mask in the game i've wanted one in a fallout game for so long
---
Y‚Äôall are ripped
---
I'll open it for you mate
---
A bug like this would almost be funny if it wasn't so sadly typical.
---
OMG yes please
---
Palace of the winding path, rifle gaming just did a video ok it
---
Yeah :(
---
Thanks man
---
I did it on a junk extractor that's close to a picnic area so I can collect wood and tin cans.
---
Copper, for the plasma cartridges
---
If I had to guess it would be the stings and things daily quest. Sadly I am not 100% sure, I should pay more attention to those things but I don't.
---
Since the update I have done both Pioneer scout dailies every day and the campfire quest many times.
---
Bless you good sir
---
This obviously a troll. Scrapping items in front of him? Scrapping legendaries in front of him? So he fought them after dropping his items? And just happened to be right next to a legendary script machine and a workbench with people who were his friends? Plz.
---
I have a lead and junk collector on my lot.  :)
---
For the lead and junk.  But now I am sort on steel of all things...
---
I did one of these the other day, and was purposely trying to avoid even damaging the horde boss.  Until the dumb cunt literally ran in front of me as I was firing at another of it's cronies.  Instant death, event over on the first interation.  I was a sad panda.
---
Aaaaannnd here we have a person who tries to use shame and exploit group think mentality to  lecture them because he thinks anyone gives a damn about his oppinion or his perspective ... what do you people think about 'this' person?
---
Love that. Sounds like the beginning of a nursery rhyme. Be sure, I will sing it at certain situations.
---
Lead... but I took it out after a long while since it is plentiful in other places and extractors are a budget sinkhole
---
&gt; Can't quite be a plague doctor if I'm a plagued doctor, eh? 
---
That's some Kanye level "I'm not a business man, I'm a business, man" level of writing there.
---
Bait profile.
---
You talk like you're from the Annex, eh.
---
I got it in December, and it started Rocky, but has gotten alot better.
---
 Not a whole lot of prepackaged story, but you are able to build your own narrative any way you want.  It's a fun game.
---
fertilizer-because brahmin
---
I'm not sure. I prefer to run just unarmed so I was surprised that when I equipped the meat hook it was so much lower than the deathclaw.  I mean it isn't even close. What I need to do is put on my 1h perks and see what it says then.
---
I bet in Bethesda fashion when they fixed it they put the wrong perk set for the meat hook.
---
The war was fought for many reasons. The key one, is what I wrote about above. Again, don't confuse what the primary driver of the war was (the issue of slavery in the United States) with policy outcomes proposed by each side regarding slavery.
---
For those that initiated the war, it was the key issue. Did the end of slavery threaten the Southern economy? Yes, which is why "Bleeding Kansas" happened. Were there concerns over the reach of the Federal government regarding a practice allowed per the Constitution? Yes.  
---
But each and every one of those issues was centered on the ownership of humans. Not focusing on the North and their intentions here, since their goodwill only went so far as to pioneer segregation (given that they were the states that disallowed slavery first.)
---
Yea I saw that video. Looked real good.
---
You need to write a book,I was seriously involved in this lol
---
I found that in the enclave bunker at its vendor in the production section it shows up 50% of the time for me.  Easy to get üëçüèº
---
Griefing isn't really a big deal. There are always assholes and there are a few ways to do it currently but counting about 500+ hours of playing... I've only came across 1 person.
---
Cannot wait to start! Update file is installing at a snail's pace.
---
Is a glitch that's been around a whilen but after the last update (project paradise update) it's been pretty frequent for me too.
---
Stings and things. I‚Äôve gotten a few.
---
Still available?? I'd love to stop by your shop if so
---
For half level homes, you can build a foundation (best to keep it low as you can), build a ramp going up from that foundation, attach a foundation to that ramp, remove the ramp, and you now have 2 foundations of 2 different heights that are exactly half a vertical tile apart from each other. You can easily place either the wooden or concrete stairs on the higher foundation, and the bottom half of those stairs will clip right into the foundation below it with no issues. This of course only works on the ground though...
---
I did this too...
---
I have two pieces of armor that prevent 50% of my fall damage. I want to trick new players into diving off of something high into some water somewhere. 
---
Or maybe I can put on a stunt show...
---
For yellow and fluorescent, nuke the Whitespring. For red and purple nuke the queen. For cobalt nuke lake Grafton. Honorable mention to Harper's Ferry for a variety pack heavy on blue and purple.
---
Survival mode should temp disable all mutations.
---
√ì.o
---
I run a stealth sniper with high carry capacity and weight reduction and a heavy weapons in power armour build on the same character, I can have most perks I use maxed across strength perception and intelligence. 
---
This gives me the freedom to switch between play styles depending on what I‚Äôm doing.  This is just my personal preference of course, many people prefer a specialised maxed build.
---
None, because I value AESTHETIC over material needs.
---
My camp is on a big flat cliff near Site Bravo. It has no resource deposits or water, but the view is great.
---
Yup I tried this after latest patch. Can confirm. 
---
Nothing to do. 
---
Log off. Log in
---
It just works.
---
Hey, you should be happy that at least now when you craft or repair something it doesn't treat that X-01 Jetpack mod or calibrated shocks mod you've been holding on to like THAT is scrap.  I'll take the annoyance of bulk scrap being scrapped any day over that shit which used to happen.
---
Because Plague Doctor's mask were never actual gas masks...
---
right? my character is over 50 now with luck still at 1, if that isn‚Äòt ironic then i don‚Äòt know
---
LubricatedSnake
---
Oil because caps. But the oil seep I‚Äôm extracting from is on the shore of a lake where I can also farm water and ticks. Also it‚Äôs just a nice area - I camped on the other side of the lake before I even knew the oil seep was there.
---
**Auto Grenade Launcher Does Not Adopt Prefix of Primary Legendary Effect**  
---
All legendary variants simply are called "Auto Grenade Launcher". I presume the effects work, though. 
---
**Strings of Modifications for Weapons Are Incorrect / Inaccurate / Applied to the Wrong Mod**  
---
Surely this has been listed by someone, somewhere, but for completion sake, and since it's plagued us for ever *(don't understand how as I seem to recall them being correct in FO4)* I might as well mention it... My hope is it's just the strings that are mixed up and not what they do as well.  
---
I wish I knew all of the affected weapons here, too, but off hand:  
---
\-Gauss *(barrels are a mess, I think some capacitors are incorrect, too)*  
---
\-Gatling Plasma *(the addons, like 'beam splitter', are kinda misleading as it turns it into a flamethrower instead of a shotgun like it implies)*  
---
\-Various weapons "Prime Receiver" do not do any more damage than Hardened, or the base receiver in those instances. Sometimes it's less damage, but that's rare that I've noticed that. (I can break this out into its own 'bug' if you'd rather, since it's less "String" related it seems. Can also specifically look through which weapons this applies to and list them.)
---
\- *&lt;will add more as I remember&gt;*
---
Pm‚Äôd you!
---
Added you!
---
We know, we all know. And Bethesda knows. We've just gotta wait and see if they do anything about it
---
Yeah, I have to specifically make bulk scrap runs in order to avoid scrapping them.
---
Start with the pharma farma perk to get a good supply of chems.  Do a couple of the responders missions till you get some plans like generator and water purifier. Set up your first camp across the the overseers camp near the water so you can set up a purifier. Being close to the overseers camp allows you access to a stash and work benches. So on your camp you just have to build a tinker bench. The good thing about this area is alot of higher level players come and drop off stuff for lower level players, like weapons plans and ammo
---
It is a good thing.
---
I don't use missile launchers but a lot of heavy weapons builds do.
---
If you use heavy weapons.......
---
Fast travel to the Watoga Civic Center and get 2 missiles. Then for 0 caps keep fast traveling to your location at the Civic center and get 2 more missiles every time for 0 caps. Repeat until you have as many missiles as you desire.
---
The rest of you can suck my dick....I won't share anymore useful info here.
---
People incorrectly use the term "griefing" for any unwanted PVP player interactions.
---
There are certainly cases where people do grief others, but more often than not you get called a griefer for contesting workshops. 
---
True griefing is near impossible now. You cannot harm player CAMPs. You cannot harm players in many cases. The only real exploit now has to do with Wanted status and certain "spikes" mutations that damage anyone who attacks you.
---
Yes it's possible to do it solo. About 80% of the time you will fail the quest because the boss enemy will 1 shot the friendly monster.
---
That's super helpful, thanks so much!
---
Try to find other vault dwellers to travel with, it is a blast with a good crew.
---
I know, RNG hasnt been kind these past 3 days of server hopping, ive seen every piece instock excepts masks
---
I've always gone for lead. I used to try to stay somewhat close to whitesprings or the cranberry bog but now that caps are extremely easy to come by I decided to go with any lead extractor that was close to a vendor.
---
I can't help, sorry, I'm on xbox. But from this point on, unless you know the person for real, or have played with their character for months, treat everyone with a healthy dose of distrust. Never get a weapon modded by someone else until you have a secondary available. Never tell anyone how many caps you have, or how many sets of PA you have. If someone offers to mod your PA, do it one piece at a time, making sure you get exactly what you asked for.
---
You didn't state what level you were, so I'm going to assume because you had X-01 armour you weren't a noob, you'll just have to get around the power armour spawn points and rebuild from scratch. Then there's the gathering of fluxes needed for X01 parts. You should have some plans for PA parts, check at a power armour station for what you are capable of building.
---
Also, it shows 3 different paints for the pump-action shotgun. I only see one that I can apply (the third pic on the atom shop).
---
Nvm, it‚Äôs based on the mod as mentioned above... üòÖ

What if it were a skin which could be applied to existing gas masks which you find lying around?
---
Yeah, I thought I had this genius idea where I wouldn't max out perk cards and then I could just add individual ones on top of each other to fit into my SPECIAL limits as needed.  Like instead of maxing out Commando to lvl3, I would leave each upgrade alone then add each individual perk card so if I only had space for 2, I could fit 2.  Buuttttttt..... didn't account for the "only 1 perk of a kind at a time"...  So I'm back at square one of trying to figure out how to build.
---
I guess the best way forward would be max out the ones I feel are truly important to my character's "purpose" then the rest I can leave under developed for special instances.  Like Power Armor.  I'm not trying to roam in Power Armor but know Nuke Zones require it.  So I can leave PA perks at low level I guess...
---
Anyway, thanks for responding!
---
Junk, so if anyone comes to my camp to buy, they get free junk.
---
It also helps when my visitors don‚Äôt kill their spawns. I‚Äôll have the junk to repair my house. 
---
Also, the land is pretty clear and flat-ish, so it‚Äôs easier for me to build. I‚Äôm not creative enough for rough terrain.
---
That doesn't make sense... there are tonnes of VAs recorded in the game on holotapes
---
Than it's same thing as increasing STASH, with the extra step of needing to take the vending machine out of storage when you want to access the items stored in it.
---
Oh wow that's good to know! It's what stopped me playing GTA online when you couldn't even go from A to B without some dick in a helicopter destroying you or your vehicle over and over again.
---
Its because Microsoft makes the cards. Its basically just a Microsoft points card specifically for FO76.
---
Never had this glitch before but I think it‚Äôs a visual glitch, try logging out and logging back in a couple of times.
---
Wtf really!! Lol feel like that‚Äôs me trying to get strangler bloom.... all u come across trying to grind are the pods... like wtf eh
---
If I had one I would give u it. Good luck üò¨
---
I‚Äôll check when I get on. Which one are you looking for?
---
I've got an Interloper camp next to that large tree / worship site of theirs with all the bodies near point pleasant. Built a church-type building but there isn't much to decorate it with. Candles, bone chimes, and punji boards are really all I've got to add to it. Only thing hood about it is the location it's next to
---
I think I know what camp your talking about.  but when I got there I was same how over near the powerplant.  It was very weird.  No idea how I teleported.
---
Do most people play silently or over a headset if they're in a group? It would be nice to travel with other people!
---
 Really Marsupial and a Jet Pack makes more sense. I have that and its kinda great. 
---
 I was looking at Bird Bones for real flying but I can't take the Strength hit. I run Combat Knives in melee and it all hangs on Strength.
---
I'm glad to hear that!
---
how often would u say an encounter like this is in-game? like just creativity/team work wise?
---
I restarted the game once and tried again. No dice. I'll repair the installation and get back to you. Thanks
---
i would love to grow and sell weed. rolling different kinds of joints and smoking them was a great mod in fallout 4. the effects were somewhat like jet, overly saturated colors and of course stat benefits. and great 3rd person animations.
---
Nope.
---
Well ESO team could give Fallout 76 team some love. They need to learn from each other at times.
---
Go to the scout camp, where swarm of suitors event can spawn. There is a scout master mr handy there. Talk to him to get the order of the tadpole quest.
---
Go to any train station - there are posters that will start the quest.  Look for the one about the pioneer scouts.  Ever upwards!
---
I found my first TSE weapon at lvl 7(pipe pistol) the first week the game came out. I found my second yesterday, on my sixth character at lvl 63. The game is all about weird weird luck.
---
May have to give that one a try. Being nuking weird spots just to see what it has anymore.
---
Wow I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully it gets better.
---
Just got the last one today.
---
AID is stupidly abundant in this game.  "VATS" is my response to any other point you have.  Sure hope you don't wander across someone that's actually playing to kill other players.  You'll know when you die instantly, over and over, with no hope of changing the outcome unless you shoot first with the same build.
---
I‚Äôm just trying to help by experience, you‚Äôre welcome.
---
Is... that the top of the Highstreet in Edinburgh (outside The Hub)? üòç
---
If it didn't create a dump (check the game folder) then you can open task manager, right click Fallout76.exe, click "Create Dump File" and it'll make a gigantic dump file in C:\Windows\Minidump (this is the default location--YMMV).
---
Once you run WinDbg (or your preferred analysis tool), feel free to delete the giant dump files that Windows makes (multi-gigabyte size).  The ones the game makes rarely exceed 300kb.
---
What platform? I can help on PC.
---
Go to the Pioneer Scout Camp up in the Toxic Valley near Grafton Steel to join the scouts. Complete the 4 tadpole challenges (including getting 3 badges) to get the backpack.
---
Edit: It walks you through 3 of the challenges. Find out how to get the badges by looking at the world challenges tab in the menu.
---
I was farming glowing anglers doing this, over 100+ dead, near Harper's Ferry the other day, and I never got a 3* legendary or anything to spawn. 
---
However, there was a 3* in the initially spawned group of underlings to the horde boss. Weird.
---
Veil of Mysteries doesn't explicitly say anything about Airborne Sickness Protection, but it's there. Zero penalties, weighs 0.1
---
Hopefully it's for real. Thanks in advance if you look it up.
---
That‚Äôs 3 star legendary advice right there, appreciate it pal
---
YES!  I bought it assuming it would be a gas mask.  It is called a Plague Doctor Mask - assumi g it would stop the plague is logical...
---
Lead - I chew through bullets like mad so it helps to have a steady supply.
---
I usually move camp based on lead deposit location - Im now settled with a nice lead deposit and a central ish location since I fast travel a lot
---
Omg yassss I need a dog to be there by my side. I need dogmeat.
---
I used to go for useful camps, now I try and create mid century houses on vistas. There's enough junk to be found in game, but watching the sunset from your deck with a SB flying around in the background is what this game is all about.
---
*Regarding:*  **Issue: Gauss Rifle "Hit" Bug**   
---
I don't know if this is at all related, but seriously, I cannot hit **SHIT** anymore with my Lever Action when scoped (Reflex)!! I have made **no** adjustments to modifications for probably the last... at least 4 patches, but as of Patch 9.5 something has gone horribly wrong :( I don't shoot from the hip with it all *that* often, but I'm willing to say that it likely applies to that as well. Where I can say I notice this the most are two places. 1) Arktos Pharma's new area, particularly when trying to shoot something while I'm next to a handrail, but its exacerbated if they, too, are behind one. 2) Whitespring Resort both nuked and post-nuked, as I cannot hit a Glowing One to save my goddamn life. No literally, I die quite often since I miss so goddamn much! 
---
*However*, the Whitespring issue might be something else. I get the impression that they may be using the **other** Glowing One's hitbox, whose name I can't recall, but they're the thin ones that look like a typical ghoul, not bloated and 'fat' like what we generally encounter in nuked zones. I say this because I've seen my rounds hit the edges of their torso and not count. I don't mean a "graze", but a solid gut-shot that would take out a kidney. I've seen this happen on both sides while they're running a certain direction, so it's not due to me failing to lead them enough before I shoot. All I know is the amount of ammo I've expended just in the last 3 days is unprecedented, with Arktos and Whitespring being the main two places I've been at. 
---
...... Mmm... Ok so I'm going to still post this, but add an addendum:  
---
I just realized I picked up Twisted Muscles mutation, ***but*** I'm pretty certain this happened today, and would primarily only apply to the Arktos handrailing portion (I've only been playing an hour and besides player vendors, Arktos was my first real stop). I feel this is a today-mutation because I see that I forgot to re-apply Starched Genes perk, though I'm not sure when or where I would've picked up the mutation unless while incapacitated from legendary bot's reactor as gone critical, which I believe also produces radiation after exploding.
---
Either way, that -50% Rifle Accuracy would explain being unable to hit the broad side of a barn in Arktos, but doesn't account for my experience with Glowing Ones. 
---
I may as well also add that since roughly Patch 7, or 6.5, I noticed Super Mutant's heads have become much harder to hit. Not just at range, but up close, and with various weapons. It's bad enough that I either aim for the neck, or just go for the body entirely to ensure I hit them. As such, gone are my days of one-shoting Super Mutants :(
---
What does that mean?
---
I made a compound with a church like area too! If you're on PC, lmk with a message, I'd love to see your camp
---
I‚Äôm 99% we‚Äôre in the same place. üòÅ
---
oh wow, what a great start into the game. nice. 
---
i haven‚Äôt found my first explosive or even bloodied weapon yet, but i‚Äòm glad i finally got a chameleon leather armor the other day (even tho it‚Äôs level 10, wtf). the purveyor hasn‚Äòt been very nice to me so far haha
---
Just hop in with an open mind.  The game was a dumpster fire at launch but it's much improved now.  
---
Just know gear has levels and can be upgraded with mods.  make sure you upgrade your armor/weapons every 5 - 10 levels and learn the mods from scrapping items at crafting benches.  
---
Have fun!
---
Honestly I do not know. I'm from the US.... I'd imagine they do but I cannot be sure. I'm not sure of how worldwide they are but if you have Amazon I'd start there. I'd also check any Video Game stores you visit.
---
I hope you can get your friend the Stalkers outfit it's a cool gift idea.
---
Also I learned through this post these are not availible on PC :/ seems dumb they do not have Atom gift cards for those players.
---
I've seen and done both. Some people gave me some flak for not talking, but the guy I was rolling with backed me up( it was a group chat he invited me to). There are a few emotes you can use to react without talking. It is easier when everyone talks though.
---
No, I don't run into that problem because I manage the weight of my character and stash well, apparently much better than a "broad swath" of the player base. Somehow, I'm able to pull off this miracle of inventory management that doesn't penalize me for dying like it does for you. Must be because of my egotistical ignorance.
---
Also, I wouldn't use mad to describe my response, more flabbergasted at your narcissism. Or as you might put it, how egotistical you were responding to my original comment. Seeing this reply however, I definitely struck a nerve lol. I mean you repeated egotistical and ignorant 3 and 4 times respectively.
---
The issues you are running into are cause 100% by your own design. I mean sure I bet there are bugs involved, but bugs you are setting yourself up to run into. If you know they exist, and have no power to fix them yourself, why do you keep playing the way are? Bloodied and Unyielding do not require you to have that much weight on you at any given time. That is your choice. You even said it yourself originally, try exploring different things in the game.
---
Also, ignorance is a lack of knowledge or experience with something, seems like the only willfully ignorant one of us is you. Out of the two of us, only one runs into these bugs and still does nothing to change it.
---
But yeah, I'm the troll. Dropping all my egotistical ignorance all over this thread.
---
Okay. Sorry for asking so many questions lol. So you don‚Äôt lose armor or gear or weapons or ammo?
---
It's just outside a wee bit from Edinburgh Castle, from where those pics were taken. Edinburgh Castle is an unlockable player home in the game.
---
In the forest, keep an eye open for the leader of the pack event. It‚Äôs a good way to pick up low level legendary weapons and armor.
---
 I don't see how the Chameleon mutation is worth it. My Chameleon Armour bits make me very sneaky in my Bos Heavy Combat set, and I'm certainly not going through the pain for what seems to be a worse way to do invisible.
---
It does base + 25%
---
Thats inclusive of all bullets shot
---
Why would i joke
---
Thanks so much!
---
That would be cool for my paintball arena
---
One of my early camps hung off a Cliffside because it looked amazing. I regretted it the first time I fast traveled there because it spawned me in midair, just inches away from the platform, so I just dropped straight to the ground below.
---
You will get only %10 because of you are mutated person.
---
That's good to know, thank you so much!
---
I second everything they say above, but I say as soon as you can build all the benches, move halfway between a train station and 76 while you explore the forest. That way you have two free fast travel points, and are never too far from a trader. Also now that player vending is a thing, absolutely stop by every camp you see. Alot of people sell duplicate plans/ low level weapons for 10 caps and under, and it can really help a new adventurer.
---
I will, thanks so much for the tip!
---
Junk, FTW!
---
These work for most, but not all people.  However, for *all* people, they take a significant amount of time to get used to wearing for more than a few minutes at a time.  They are nothing like other glasses and every single person I've spoken to that's utilized them more or less relegates them to a fun toy.
---
Color Blind myself, part of a community of gamers numbering ~1500 that tries to find solutions to this stuff.  We've tried every combination of these glasses as they've come out over the years.  Precisely zero can be utilized more than a few minutes, if at all, while gaming.
---
Anti-cheat stuff blocks overlays of other colors that can add some contrast and greatly help most of us, as well.
---
Games like Fallout, or Mustard World as we've come to call it, are a fucking nightmare for red/green (Protan, by far the most common) color blind individuals.
---
Beth‚Äôs tech side may be uneven, but the aesthetic designers really are amazing. Literally everything ‚Äúreal world‚Äù you see was taking from a real life example in 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs era living.
---
All that effort is why they are reluctant to implement more contemporary stuff people sometimes demand.
---
That's really good to know, thank you so much!!
---
Did you scrap all junk?
---
And your not losing ammo either. I had 95 .45 rounds and loaded pipe relover... When i logged back in i had 101 .45 rounds and empty relover.
---
I've repaired the game, logged out and back in. Not working so far :(
---
Unfortunately heavy weapons dont have a ton in the way of mods.
---
LMG has none
---
50 cal has one mod that you can buy
---
Minigun has 3 you can learn and one mod you can buy
---
Flamer has a bunch
---
Missle launcher/grenade launcher/fat man each have a few and one you can buy.
---
Hope that helps =)
---
Not recently. And I crashed in a loading screen. So the mass I had on my shouldnt be gone considering everything else is still there
---
Can you make anything on that game
---
I know what you mean lol, I have 3x max rifleman and only tank killer 1 so it fits, I swap out 3x max heavy for strong back maxed and a couple of level 1 weight reduction perks. I find it balances out really well.
---
Orphancr1ppl3r6
---
They are not mutually inclusive. Some will want the serum, some the shocks, and maybe a few both.
---
Plus. I dont have the plans for the jet pack.
---
I've seen this too and I'm wondering the same thing. Those 80 atoms sure look nice
---
Bloodied Handmade (explosive is obviously a bit nicer) is great. I use that with a Bloodied DCG w SS. Serendipity is helpful along w Escape Artist in addition to some sneak perks. I use adrenal reaction, speed demon, healing factor, and Grounded for mutations.
---
Feels bad mate, hope you get your cards back.
---
Fairly often, this community is helpful and generous!  I get random drops of food or stims from other players when helping them clear some enemies that are giving them a hard time.
---
+25% reload speed is not a primary legendary effect, it can't be on a weapon by itself. Have you tried charging the assaultron head 20 times again? Maybe it's just a visual bug.
---
I had a guy at a train station kept asking people if they spoke spanish by going up to them and just repeating "Espanyol?". I don't. 
---
He tried english.
---
He didnt really do english.
---
The best we managed between us was the phrase "for the mission"
---
The only mission I could think of that might persade someone to desperately spend time trying to communicate with people that dont speak your language was the revive one.
---
So I stood in a river until some radtoads did me in (just in case it was the swimming one he needed).
---
He gave me a 3* (rubbish, but 40 scrip). I got the impression he'd been trying for a while.
---
Isnt hardened mass considered aid? I havent pick any up in a while so I don't remember üòÇ
---
Absolutely. I have plans for a Mothman cultist outpost, but I really need more stuff to decorate with (including the mounted mothman plan). I'd also really like a Mothman cult themed power armor skin.
---
Also, side note, speaking of the outfits: just fyi, apparently there ARE at least a couple different cultist helmets- the ritual mask is the only one you can obtain in game, currently, but there's at least two other different variations of it that I've found on dead cultists. Can only hope they'll release those eventually.
---
I wear my old man winter every so often. I was crafting the other day and noticed someone was posing for a picture next to me. They were duped on Xbox for a weekend, so they‚Äôre not as rare as they once were.
---
That was good. I have been looking for the s'mores resipe for the last two weeks.   All I need for the backpack badge.   It seams all I can get at the fireside is the tent plans.  So I would die for you if you had 3 s'mores.
---
The 3/4 wall with a slant?
---
Edit, oh I see. So yeah this piece attached to a slanted roof or to a floor or wall piece.
---
Other edit: the upside down one attaches to the top of a slanted roof.
---
According to Rifle Gamings recent video, Palace of the Winding Path. They found all types of flux in crazy numbers. 2-300 each for some of the fluxes.
---
One spawns in the vets type room at the ranger station.
---
Edit: this is also a spawn spot for the flight helmet and clean ranger outfit. Although you will probably have to hop servers for a while to get them.
---
Hope this helps.
---
That‚Äôs a nice drop. Vampire is great if you‚Äôre a Bloodied build.
---
Can you be more descriptive? What do you mean by Heat Shield? Which mods are you using on your shotgun?
---
Hahah that's great!  I love the creative ways we have to try and communicate this fairly simple action/task.
---
Same here lvl 315 found every location in the game killed sbq countless times but not according to the challenges.
---
Well considering you just got it, no. 
---
But I did a lot of damage that‚Äôs the thing
---
I‚Äôll try do that next time
---
Then it loses the second effect next time you arrive home
---
You're welcome. Now comes the life altering question, what platform are you playing on?
---
Very Looney Toons!  Cue stationary head + elongated neck while the body falls to doom.  Wouldn't it be nice if fast travel mats were a thing?
---
You cant build atomic shop items in other peoples camps unfortunately.  But, it's almost June, the Christmas season is only like 3 weeks away, if you're a good little Wastelander we will see what Santa brings you.
---
I'm sure it will be available again come this Christmas.  They've already reintroduced a few items they had said were limited time only ;)
---
Thanks this really helps
---
[Here's a picture ](http://imgur.com/a/2uYRdDf)
---
I also recommend popping on once a day, even if it's just for 5 minutes to check out the Daily challenges. Alot of them are convoluted and not worth it, but there's usually one or two that are easy to do in a minute or two. And check the shop as well, since sometimes there are free items or flash sales if you see something you want but don't have the atoms for.
---
I was using the dragon and perfect storm most of the time
---
Ok, thats a pretty cool easter egg
---
&gt;Watch, in pure amazement, as he defies DEATH in a plunge from 8 stories into a water glass!  Stick around because after that you will not want to miss the clowns juggling LIVE GRENADES!
---
They have armor my friend
---
Grab tank killer and go to town
---
Please tell me you made him stand in Flatwoods Creek for that, or else I have some frustrating news...
---
Thanks I've submitted a support ticket so hopefully The Bethesda team can help me out.
---
Tank killer? 
---
I am interested....
---
Yeah I tried that but was pretty disappointed by the results. I was trying to vaguely recreate a huge house my grandparents built when they were young and it didn't really go the way I wanted
---
No I found it several times at the antique shop
---
I know it is disappointing they want us to pay for skins but put little effort in making them
---
PS4, I don't have the money or space for a decent PC/laptop at the moment! Is that good or bad? I pretty much had to delete half my harddrive to install the game haha
---
Across the creek from the overseers camp I found mine for the tadpole challenge it‚Äôs also a spawn for cats &amp; squirrels if you‚Äôre grinding for the backpack
---
Good luck then!
---
I think my level 80 has the s'mores recipe already, but I've already completed the order of the tadpole on that character.  I'll  have to check to see if I do have it learned already and what materials it uses.
---
Slap a drum and a auto receiver in that bad boy and have fun clearing low lvl stuff with all your .38 ammo!
---
Got a level 50 2* Quad Explosive hardened sniper rifle yesterday from the Alpha Sheepsquatch in Arktos. Looking for price advice on it at the moment.
---
psn bo7mka112 will be on in about 1h
---
Energy weapons got a buff. Explosives and two shot got nerfed quite a bit. If you didn‚Äôt have explosive weapons, you shouldn‚Äôt notice a big difference. Are you going to higher level areas? Level and weapon of choice?
---
I try to entertain.  Probably too hard, and not always successfully.  But persistence is the key!  Every success has 1000 failures or something like that!
---
&gt; Radroaches are the size of your head, doesn't make them any more dangerous...
---
Unless you're Butch's Mom.
---
That should be easy enough! I only work three days a week and once my kid goes to bed I'm free for gaming the rest of the night. You've been so helpful!
---
Bugged. I hear that for the queen, you have to be the one that makes the final shot
---
It actually also spawns in the left side nook of the reception desk too
---
Oh man that's pretty great... It sounds like the game is predicated on being filled with fun players like you n your kids. I oughtta make the jump. Cheers!
---
Yeah this was on my alt I just started, got the Order of the Tadpole quest fairly early on so all the other activities would sort of just naturally accrue over time.  The Encryptid even also has a lot of deaths and it takes place mostly in water, so you can knock out two tasks with one stimpack!
---
Son of a bitch you did it!
---
What was the item in question?
---
OK. So 1250 overall? That's awesome :)
---
Setinal assassin marine armor chest piece
---
Sorry, but it grinds my gears when people say mute fruit...
---
This is pleasant, and makes me feel like a half roasted marshmellow.
---
Add the perk that lets you get more anyway and woooo boy... Made 100 healing salve in no time.
---
High level players can be so nice! I recently have some new players some low level legendaries and then my new toon was gifted a three star ts pipe rifle.
---
No I was so excited I totally forgot about the Swimmer badge.  It's OK I had already completed Athlete, Archery and Mammalian so I got the bare minimum out of the way.  I'm sure I'll have plenty of opportunities in the future to revive a swimmer, especially with getting a couple of my friends to start playing with me.
---
Ages ago I spent the better part of two days worth of game time just trying to get up there for the hat after I got the uniform. I've also made and scrapped a couple hundred black powder rifles trying to unlock the bayonet to fully complete the look.
---
Get tank killer and an armour piercing magazine, but I had a similar problem with rifles. For some reason they seem to be less effective than pistols. And the heaviest weapons in the game.
---
Pretty much anything. It works the same way as the Call Of Duty Emblem creator, if you've played that...except instead of 30-50 layers you get 3000 layers, per side of the vehicle.
---
Ah. Yeah I‚Äôm gonna grab tank killer, once I‚Äôm level 30!
---
That's a great idea. I live over a pond and I need the "revive someone in water" thing done. I'll put up a sign in front of my vending machines. By the way, the left-most machine is full of FREE items if anyone needs stuff. My store is the thrift shop of FO76. No overpriced crap here!
---
Yes I am constantly amazed at this community.  I don't do a ton of multiplayer gaming but my experiences with this have been 99% positive and uplifting.
---
What? There were red rocket camp bits?
---
It‚Äôs a popular wee spot, became even more so after Oxhorn camped near there I noticed
---
Sorry if it‚Äôs too obvious, but have you exited and reloaded? This happens to me a lot when I am storing or scrapping things really quickly. Usually walls or foundations. Reloading makes it disappear.
---
True. Moreso Bethesda than vice versa, lol.
---
Hardened mass is junk, high radiation fluids and glowing mass are aid.
---
I'll even get the materials if I can have the s'mores. You can find what material are needed on line
---
Oh that's really cool I might pick it up
---
Hopefully this time, they actually advertise what they show.
---
What they advertised: [https://imgur.com/JlyJEP9](https://imgur.com/JlyJEP9)

What you get in-game:  [https://imgur.com/adKEQw2](https://imgur.com/adKEQw2)

(just a reskin of the regular garage door)
---
To quote another post "its like a giant fucking violet dildo" 
---
I think it's funny. Spread that across Appalachia. Make them fear you dildo tipped shotgun.
---
Someone just walked up to me and asked ‚Äúhey can you go drown for me?‚Äù And upon fulfilling that request gave  me 50 Stimpaks
---
It definitely does. Thank you.
---
Dev room access was on pc, I saw someone wearing a jester mask during the event on ps4.
---
hahaha dang thats intimidating. care bear faction confirmed for nuclear winter.
---
Im on an acid node. I initially camped elsewhere for aesthetics and water, but with vending it put me at a major disadvantage. Now I'm on an acid node, which I always struggled for. I know where plenty of lead and steel is but smelting was hard.
---
Do note that the guy has named himself "Internet Historian" for a reason: his content is literally indexing events as a historian in an entertaining style long after said events have become relevant. He reminds people of what happened long after said events like a historian does so said events won't be forgotten. If anything, he exists to remind people who weren't aware of these events when they happened that they happened at all. I wasn't aware of most of the things he has so far covered (the Balloon Boy incident, Rainfurrest, and Dashcon) but am glad that he told me since otherwise i may have never learned.
---
Good point. Will definitely try it out. Thanks!
---
\[PC\]! I'm camped over a pond but am happy to go anywhere my camp can be placed to do this. IGN: 2HappySundays Only issue is Sydney, Australia timezone.
---
Oh really? Been there few times by now. 
---
Maybe I‚Äôll try again. Thanks!
---
Pretty sure you have to get the last shot on her.
---
Great help. Thanks a lot!
---
Thanks man! I‚Äôll try
---
and some new roof shapes
---
There are two, three spots that caught my eye for nukes someday - Aaronholt is one of them. Been curious since a while about that.
---
You are %100 correct  on the skinand have made my day; i already had it!
---
Me me me me plz someone raine137 on PS4 I need to revive I'll happily die for someone
---
They already took away the excessively duped items and banned the dupers once. Dupers use multiple smurf accounts to dupe now so there isnt much to be done. Besides, at this point almost everyone has something God tier so now it's just people collecting as many God tiers as possible which doesn't really make a difference.
---
No, is garbage roll -_-
---
Yeah I just feel bad not helping out. Especially those times where no-one wants to become a conduit - sheesh! I've revived many but not close enough to the water. It's a bit chaotic too.
---
Yes! Build to maximize damage in a specific weapon type. Look for ways to improve (layer) damage mitigation. Read up on basic combat tatics. Also let the frustration of dying motivate you to get better.

[](/awesome)Just some fun math for you: The Dragon shoots four 200dmg shots with no perks totaling 800, then you add in Rifleman perks adding 60% bonus for 1280DMG, then you add in Bloody Mess for another 15% that's 1472DMG, and then you add in Adrenal Reaction at low health for another %50 boost that's 2208DMG, and then you add in Psychobuff for another 25% boost bringing it to 2760DMG, then you chug a Ballistic Bock for another 15% to make it 3174DMG, and then you shoot it as a Vats Critical for an additional 100% with a VATS critical legendary effect %50 Better Critical's 40% Eagle Eyes 25% Blight soup's %20 bonuses for 10632DMG, then you add in instigating for double damage that's:  
---
***21265DMG*** on a two star legendary that's NOT legacy, and also not counting the additional effective damage buff you could get with Tank killer. Even with the full effect of a whole set of Assassins Sentinel's Heavy Metal armor on all four bullets with a max ranked Dodgy, Bullet Shield, Barbarian at 20str, Ironclad, Bodyguards with a full team, Nerd Rage, Evasive, and Junk Shield: 2833DMG would leak through. Your only hope would be a Serendipity proc to have a chance against this VATS guaranteed hit.  
---
So in short, the dragon is bucking awesome.
---
Won‚Äôt start
---
I have that for sale 3* with extra 10 percent damage while aiming and I think quicker speed while aiming plus 2 shot 1499 caps on Xbox if you are interested. 10 percent would be extra 125 damage.
---
Blocker, dodgy, nerd rage and serendipity are probably the most useful, survival wise.
---
In all honesty, the true intent of this post was to convince me to move, as I‚Äôve recently been coveting junk nodes. It‚Äôs good to know there‚Äôs some in agreement no upgrade exists. :)
---
I know one is a skull being force-fed a gas mask filter because those corpses are next to my camp but I don't know about the other one
---
Just sent u a fr
---
I still need to do this on xbox
---
And new friends
---
Just sent u fr
---
Saw it come through. Accepting now
---
Yea I just switch to one on my quick wheel... but I use 5 different guns and 2 melee on the wheel so I stay switching
---
800+ hours in and have seen double exactly zero times.
---
Yeah, exactly, you're the ignorant, egotistical troll. Glad to see you got that part.
---
And believe it or not - they get to manage the Cryptids weekly in one snap family portrait.
---
I‚Äôve been playing a survival mode only character I just started with a no outside trade/transfer clause (I will use in-game player vending) and it‚Äôs been a lot of fun and definitely makes the game more challenging and rewarding for me. I highly recommend it if you feel so inclined.
---
Nice!  Post apocalyptic capitalism is weird in many ways.  First we use bottle caps to pay for literal garbage, now we pay in life/death for life saving implements.  Whats next, sandwiches for haircuts?!?
---
Yea man i did only Atom challenges for 2 weeks straight to get enough Atom points to get the Stalker outfit bundle that comes with the jacket, bandana and the goggles! The outfit looks badass with the gas mask with goggles and the army helmet. Check it out.
---
If Bethesda ever releases a option to buy / gift your friend Atom shop items, i will gladly throw down 10 euros and buy that Stalker outfit bundle for my friend.
---
Gotta go check out the nearest gamestop or one other store that sells game related stuff. Might find Atom cards or not.
---
Same.  Interestingly, it happens when I logout or disconnect with the weapon selected.   If I have a melee equipped, then logout and back in, or server hop, they are all at what they were before.
---
I always check food, water, and ammo loads on all weapons before moving from my camp, so it doesn‚Äôt really bother me.
---
Not saying it's the best build, but I enjoy it, works well for me.

---
If you see the Encryptid event pop up, go there!  Lots of people gonna die.
---
Evasive isn't worth the point cost. 1 piece of bolstering armor will give you more resistance then 2 points in Evasive, and 10 points shut off the maxed card.
---
Serendipity is a must. Blocker is a must. Dodgy is nice if you have AP regen perks and/or armor pieces, otherwise it'll drain your AP in a heartbeat if you get swarmed by enemies.
---
Also, radicool is also worth the cost. 1 perk point for +5 str is a steal.
---
They cant track where the gun or armor started... hence no way to tell if it was duped or earned unfortunately... they need to put serial numbers on their items haha
---
nah, they just naturally synchronize together. All three of them give you a bonus to damage, resistances, etc while you are at low health. Naturally if you will run one, there's no reason not to use all three. That's what makes bloodied builds so overpowered
---
I also wanted to ask if anyone had this. I use a lmg to try and be the last hit on her but it didn't work so far.
---
I did this with a super mutant horde boss, best case scenario horde type, prob 20 minutes... got an extra 1 star from a 1 star enemy
---
not enough time to judge but is it really worth it? I know I won't be trying again.
---
You'll be helping if you state what platform you're on.
---
I would also like for the stairs that have the posts and wire floors to stack onto each other.
---
And it would be cool if they add the elevators from the Contraptions DLC in Fallout 4.
---
Because everyone would bitch and complain saying the game was pay to win *cough cough legacykillahd
---
Yeah sorry just added it's Xbox One
---
I hope so. I will drop some atoms on that in a heartbeat.
---
Thanks.  There were so many people shoting at her and I was hitting her so maybe I did not get the last hit.
---
Try scrolling your deck to the right? If you have too many cards all of them are not visible and it seems they've just disappeared after upgraded cards unequip automatically.
---
Thanks!~
---
Ok thanks I'll try to find the post
---
Well the DMV in Charleston has an entry for robot registration so maybe someday I just hope the line is short this time damn j-42
---
This quest definitely makes friends, if you already don't have a squad.
---
Not being able to snap a top floor or roof because it‚Äôs intercepting another object when it clearly isn‚Äôt üôÑ
---
True but there‚Äôs no reason why the blue isn‚Äôt available along with the red. I‚Äôm also missing the pulse line on the pump part. Plus the suppressor skin is removed when it really should match the color.
---
They should have made it s gasmask skin. P2w Problem solved.
---
Ay man, all I know is 2+2 is 4. Maths is wasted on me. But that's awesome. 21k a shot. That's like, double what I paid for it!
---
They give you a code cause its not 2005 anymore. Diablo 2 was the last game i got that had a disk.
---
That‚Äôs awesome!!!!!‚Äô Great truck!!!!!!
---
Quick correction, there is no left wing in American politics. Democrats and Republicans are both Right Wing parties. Democrats are just a little more left leaning. 
---
This is how American politics has always been, and this is a huge underlying theme in Fallout as well. This is exactly how Vault-Tec operates, even in the face of complete nuclear annihilation they used the opportunity to further their capitalistic gains under the guise of saving mankind.
---
Thats where i got those!
---
Oh. I'm alright thanks :) but if you're interested in my old 2* instigating one, you can chuck out a price ;)
---
Might repeat myself but...
---
**Never change amylou, never change.**
---
The last sentence deserves Gold imo. lol
---
Hah, I‚Äôve been considering whether I should move for ages too. Haven‚Äôt found anywhere that compares. I‚Äôm only like L52 and maybe once I‚Äôve finished the plot line I‚Äôll find another spot less central but pretty in a different way.
---
Nope, unless by ‚Äústarted the war‚Äù you mean ‚Äúsaid slavery is bad.‚Äù

The traitors started the war on April 12, 1861.

I‚Äôve never paid it too much attention. I‚Äôll have to go look at it next time I‚Äôm at my CAMP. I‚Äôm sure it will be so obvious and it will be all I see from now on! Lol
---
\^ Have them all but molerat too. Stings and tings drops the tick head.
---
Have fun trying to kill the wanted guy who will probably wipe the floor with you repeatedly.
---
I have a couple on the "FREE" vendor machine at my camp. Zero caps needed. Will be on in about 5-6 hours for at least 3 hours \[PC\].
---
I had been on one of the dual copper/steel nodes (steel for myself, copper for caps). 
---
My brother and I recently moved to the peaks of Seneca Rocks, complete with "feuding neighbors" signage. We each have a "fuck him" vault boy pointing at teach other, giant lit up "F U" that you can see from the other's camp, and other miscellaneous signage (like "hope you fall" that you can only see through a scope). We've both got most of the mutations, so we can get to each other's places by foot. Most people just fast travel though.
---
You got lucky as hell man
---
They spawn at Camp McClintock. It's fairly common there.
---
I have 5 pieces of unyielding armor right now. I have serendipity and blocker. Definitely going to have radicool and nerd rage. I‚Äôll have loan wanderer and instead of evasive I could get action boy/girl with dodgy for the ap regen. So it looks like don‚Äôt worry about getting sneak perks.
---
Ah the last resort. Always lashing out with the insults, incapable of any more coherent thoughts. Delicious
---
Nvm. Probably military
---
Despite the crap that FO76 gets...it is a damn masterpiece when compared to Anthem, especially when considering that Bethesda actually gives enough of a shit to slowly fix the game (or at least try to) rather than sneakily try to make it worse every patch (seriously, Anthem's patches are somehow worse than FO76's messy patches which i didn't even think was possible).
---
That‚Äôs where I was today, for a few hours server hopping, no luck, at least today, but I am gonna keep trying!
---
It‚Äôs probably because there are Bethesda employees balls deep involved in all the duping and selling of those in-game contents. I couldn‚Äôt find other possible reason why Bethesda has been so unwilling to go after dupers and completely wipe all the duped items - unless they already know who they are and they don‚Äôt mind those folks making some quick bucks on the side.
---
They have to turn them off on their game.. I ask people to stop tracking their own guest all the time cuz I dont want to look at em..
---
I've had it happen with the tattoo place where BIV is. The back door was boarded up like it was before the brewing stuff was added.
---
I gave your reply the attention it deserves. You start out with ignorance and insults and you're not moving from that. Why on earth should I devote more energy to your willful, arrogant, stupidity?
---
Knives. The 'oh crap, they're ALL running towards me' weapon. Have a couple available to get you out of this situation. No ammo, cheap to repair, don't weigh much.
---
But why make it that way, no one likes it.
---
Also bugged for places in various areas you have visited but somehow the Challenge does not recognize that you have been there.
---
 Quest completion bug. They owe me 120 Atoms. ;)
---
Go into pipboy &gt; data, they can disable quest tracking for specific quests and they should disappear.
---
Note if team leader still has his active or any different than those of it's members, they will all appear on teams screens aswell. So each individual has ability to disable his own quests, but also team leader needs to toggles theirs as well.
---
If you carefully clip the legs of the Alpha with enforcer+shotgun, it makes farming much easier because you don't have to dodge the alpha all day.  You'll have to re-clip them once the Alpha "mutates" (heals).
---
Other ‚Äúkill something‚Äù challenges require you to get the kill shot. That‚Äôs probably not realistic for SBQ, they should adjust that one.
---
I just can't see Nuclear Winter being PVP focused. Same for any major content that's coming soon. It just isn't balanced and with survival perhaps Nuclear Winter will work a tad differently. In Adventure mode I'm guessing it'll be about advancing your overseer rank by completing objectives in Vault Raids. There's evidence to believe there is a shrinking zone element that will be in the DLC. I know that is definitely in every battle royal game but that mechanic can still apply to PVE objtectives. In Survival they might add battle royal like elements to the closing zones or the vaults themselves.
---
Beats me..
---
If its taking 5-8 shots from a hardened 308 sniper to drop a super mutant or mole miner, that tells me you are likely in the middle to eastern side of the Savage Divide or other areas where the enemies scale or are just plain high level.  In the upper 20s/low 30‚Äôs, the ash heap may be a better / level appropriate area for you.
---
Tank killer will help, as will bloody mess (under Luck).
---
and i too have been playing since beta, level 210 (as of this reply).
---
so there is that, 
---
some gamers dig deeper than others Or you just haven't met some bugs that others have.
---
Do those award Possum badges or just tadpole ones? Completing some of the Possum quests is hard!
---
Scorched aren't the only ones. Now, granted, I haven't seen this bug happen in about a week, but last week I had both a dog and a bloodbug explode, both killing me instantly as I stood there looting them.
---
I think conversion without a new device would be best.  I need another workbench like I need a hole in my head.
---
Flamer (I wish)
---
You can't just use any water for the water revival?
---
You only see your own and team leaders quests. Have team leader disable theirs, and you disable your own.
---
I'm pretty sure it does. My quad laser rifle could barely get through its 120 shots without breaking (from 200% condition) when I had a splitter. After taking it off, I can last a good couple hundred fusion cells before it breaks
---
In my experience, absolutely
---
If its taking 5-8 shots from a hardened 308 sniper, that tells me you are in the middle to eastern side of the Savage divide, where the enemies scale and/or are always high level.  For upper 20s/low 30‚Äôs, the Ash Heap may be more level appropriate.
---
Tank killer and bloody mess will help.
---
The lockers in the science wing at the Enclave bunker is a spawn site for them.  Seen both dirty and clean.  Sometimes army helmets too.

No just 10%, either you‚Äôre mutated or you‚Äôre not

 I have two Combat Knives, a Nocturnal 40% Speed one and an Executioners 40% Speed one.

 Level 80 Scorchbeast jumps me at Harper's Ferry and is dumb enough to land. Its daytime so the Executioner sang the song. She died very fast. Surprised me and I have a front row seat for what these little gems can do. ;)

Team work, help your teammates find that power unit, holotape, Mayor of Watoga quest piece.

Also, PS4 "pros" And Xbox One "X"s suck compared to modern computers. They still don't run any modern games like fo76 optimally like a modern PC, plus, they have AMD processors, like crappy PCs. Heck, PS4s and Xbox Ones have the bare minimum to run fallout 76. The Xbox One X and PS4 Pro were made to run at subpar. They get you thinking it's an amazing device because of it's 16GB of RAM. But they both have less than even 3GHz! The PS4 "Pro" has 2.13GHz and the Xbox One X has 2.3GHz. That's less than half of a
---
gaming computer. All good gaming devices have at least 3.5, and all true gaming computers have 5.0 bandwidth. If it doesn't, then it's just a computer. And both xboxes and ps4s have AMD processors.
---
Yeah because I just got one and it died really quick so I‚Äôm going to take it of which one do you use
---
Some gamers dig deeper? I've done EVERYTHING in the game.  How are they digging deeper?
---
Thanks man, but just razed someone that was down!
---
Yes, without our loyal customers, my husband &amp; I wouldn't have made over 1 Million Caps and counting. The Caps come in so fast it's very difficult to find items to spend them on. Thank you all so much!! Farming 3 * enemies for hours on end is paying off more than we could ever imagine. We are by far the top sellers on PS4.
---
Gotta make sure you have your robot companion registered and pay your taxes.
---
I promote myself to leader so I don‚Äôt have to look at their quests.  No one seems to mind.  Then I make sure to turn off my quests so it doesn‚Äôt add to their screen.  Not a true fix, but it works.
---
np man if u need any help tell me. ü§ó
---
I built a little L shaped shack around an acid extractor.
---
That's provably false. All of the ban reports we saw months back during the first wave included a notice that the player was detected obtaining a large stack of X at once
---
Yeah, one set of codes for everything for the whole week. Resets on Mondays
---
At 25 you can do the quest for and build your set of ex PA. Should be good xp and level appropriate enemies.
---
Add lone wanderer and that's pretty much what I run.
---
No, and posting this for the 1000th time isnt going to change that.
---
I was thinking about testing it, but decided not to.  I'm pretty sure we all took off our backpacks.
---
Did this user scam you or is this more of a case of you falling in love after he logged out?
---
do you happen to know the one now
---
I‚Äôll try it out! Might do adventure mode first just to get some levels and gear lol
---
Dang, sounds like you got lucky. I been searching for my magic armor piece for daaaays and all anyone ever has is a bunch of useless common outfits

I like the Arktos backpack

Yeah we all know that PC is much more powerful and better for games usually but it still doesn't excuse them for it being so unstable.
---
Lol. True
---
The only one insulting anyone has been you lol. Go back and read. You got all offended at my orginaly comment and proceeded to act like a child. Lashing out with insults in a tantrum and trying to convince yourself it was all because I'm the ignorant one. It's okay little fella, cant win everytime.
---
Boil water and save purified water when you get the chemist perk. This way you can dilute stimpacks and radaway to get 4 diluted versions since handling rads and life if difficult early on unless you don't mind dying alot
---
This is a refreshing thread. I am a 100% solo player by choice, it is my preferred method of play because I am an introvert and playing Vidya is how I recharge. 
---
So I too am looking for someone to revive. 
---
I feel like they force the multiplayer thing a little too hard sometimes.  They do not need to. Make fun content that doesn't gate behind random group stuff and create a system of incentives to encourage group play without cockblocking the solo players. 
---
Multiplayer that happens naturally is the best. Forced multiplayer feels manufactured and uninspired. Build the systems and let the players loose to make their own multiplayer adventure.
---
This made me take a deep sigh
---
I just realized I had possum badges to get lol.  Nothing told me to go to camp Adams!?
---
Darn
---
There's another one that- if memory serves- is just a gas mask with a hood over it and some deer antlers tied to it.
---
Bloodied, nerd rage, adrenal mutation
