Rad Ant lager because I have a hoarding problem I can't seem to shake ... üòâ

---
---
Idk what you play on or who you are or where your at but I will find you and I will kill you
---
When are we getting them? Hasn‚Äôt it already been a month?
---
Well she didn't do it alone right? Didn't she have help from raiders or something?
---
"cosmetics only" - Bethesda's launch promisse
---
5 players is almost 1/3 of a server. I said it was deader, not dead. survival servers were the only ones dead enough to routinely accommodate that many people.
---

---
besides, they were probably rotating you through the same severs. if you wanna check how busy the game is, just keep doing that, jumping servers, but take note of the names on the map. and also wait 30 seconds before hitting play.
---
That is appropriate, as opposed to 'head canon' you willingly and eagerly accept the shot of the 'head cannon' OP has used to blow up your prefrontal cortex.
---
Now it makes sense.
---
Did you build your rig yourself? Could be a compatibility issue with your components.
---
The OP didn't say TSE, he said TS. There are non-explosive Two Shot handmades.
---
I did build it myself, but the computer runs everything else completely fine. And I have run the game before with no issues.
---
&gt;There are many existing assets that could be brought from 4 to 76 . . . 
---
Yes, *yes.  Give into the mediocrity. Continue down the path of the asset flipper and soon you will be able to sell FO4 piecemeal all over again!
---
it would be nice if a community manager would chime in on this, let us know if this will one day be a thing.
---
It's similar to the Tricentennial salute, but it isn't a crisp and snappy military-style salute. It's lazier.
---
If you look at it big picture, evolving service wise? 
---
I get the choice to not start with a settlement option. You're wading into a largely uninhabited wasteland, scrounging, just trying to get by and carve a little spot out in the wasteland. 
---
Down the road, you'd want to start seeing settlements. More people. Factions. Etc carving out bigger communities. 
---
I think that's what we're going to start seeing with wastelanders
---
Silencer for sure for that sweet sneak bonus. Preforating or stinging mag as well.
---
Are there any builds that utilise vanguard/bolstering that don't rely on sneak/stealth?
---
Something like a rifleman that can take a few hits?
---
Yes. Its not that big of a deal because i play third person. It does become a problem when im in a vault raid though, i play first person in there because its easier to pick things up.
---
On the day of the month you subscribed.
---
But you were dumping $10/mo into the game to start with - so you're already a trash person;)
---
As such, it really doesn't matter either way.
---
But, at the end of the day, this is obviously the direction you wish to see the franchise take in the future.  So go vote with your wallet and make that happen.
---
No crash reports at all in your game files?
---
WHY ARE YOU GOING TO KILL ME?! IT WAS AN ACCIDENT
---
I disagree. Please read the last paragraph :)
---
Recently, it became possible to walk beyond the invisible boundary of the map. The terrain is complete except for interactive flora and fauna and ambient noise. Rocks, trees, terrain features, etc are all there. This might indicate plans to open up the map with new locations.
---
Silencer is amazing, hardend receiver, if you are using VATS then True stock and long barrel, if you just use normal aiming then do stabilized stock and barrel
---
Nice, i was trying to get a silencer and i wanted to see if there was a nice stock but idk
---
Not gonna lie, I bought it.. But I've only been playing for about 4 weeks now and had atoms stockpiled. Also got the Blood Raider Excavator that was on sale earlier..
---
Teams help out...I can one shot all day in UF but do not try and do not always get a hit....I open the map and send friends request to anyone in the event to increase my odds just in case...This is on XBOX and may not be an option on PC from what I have heard...
---
I too am also curious if there is a resource available..
---
Just double-checked and nope, none at all
---
I hope they're updating PvP as well .we need fixes too.
---
Oh nice, i use vats quite a bit, with crowds mostly i guess to take out their heads while they are running around me.
---
Looks like a lot more underground places.
---
Disagree with what?  
---
That it doesn't matter?  You're not keeping the lights on for anyone.  That's what the cash shop was doing.
---
Or that this isn't the direction you want the franchise to go in - but you're paying them (handsomely) to take it in that direction.
---
Yeah, and I am pretty sure that the reflex sight has the least vats consumption
---
That one was rough... High chance he suffocated to death long after he had probably given up hope for rescue.
---
Honestly, I'd rather see a new 'hardcore' mode.
---
It's similar to the old Survival mode, but no legendary weapons or armor. And you'd have to create a new character for hardcore mode.
---
Finally, a fellow comrade
---
You aren‚Äôt getting ripped off if you think the price is appropriate for what you are getting. It‚Äôs all relative.
---
I am really liking to collect my set still or to perfect it more. I like vanguard, rad resist and harder to detect while sneaking. All my pieces are vanguard and harder to detect while sneaking but only have a few pieces with rad resistent.
---
I run a heavy build with heavy leather Van armor. IIRC, I‚Äôm over 500 ER. Look for weight reduction like food/drink/chems, ammo, or weapon. Those are valuable. Oh, and always have one chameleon piece of armor.
---
It‚Äôs 1am for me right now but maybe I can find something helpful when I slept for a bit. I will list
---
Everything that comes to my mind by then here.
---
What do you mean valuable commodity there 20,000 liters of it at west teck .lol
---
Same!
---
This is a bug. I've played the event without issue, but several times the containers are empty.
---
Manufactured scarcity is used to sell people all types of products. One notable example are diamonds.
---
I fully agree. Sounds plausible in theory. I dont know how easy itd be as far as the programming goes to tell whether someone was afk or not.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm just surprised you are running without stabilized.  Heavy Weapon accuracy is so bad without it.
---
I disagree that it makes me a trash person to support a game that I enjoy. I genuinely don‚Äôt care about your feelings.
---
Hmm.
---
Probably a bit hard to code.
---
Maybe something like you choose a pre-fabricated building and get to decorate it as you choose.
---
Could be a house, a shop, a bar, a greenhouse...but you only get to add furniture and decorations.
---
Probably still way outside their ability to code on the engine successfully.
---
Lever mods are a pain in the ass to get.  
---
You will need to find a plan to make the gun (harpers ferry vendor)
---
Then you will need to make a bunch of guns and scrap them.
---
The lever doesnt drop much, so you have to rely on making and scrapping your own guns to get the plans to modify it. 
---
Take a bunch of Intel increasing stims and food before you start, to increase your chances of learning a plan.
---
Putting on a full suit of unyeilding and dropping your health works too (for the int boost)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
On mine I use a Stabalized Barrel and Stock, Hardened receiver and Reflex Sight, and a supressor for sneak bonus.

This is a good compendium of rare and interesting junk. I personally enjoy the musical instruments.
---
Well they said a while ago they were working on where a player doesn't have to go in an event area and get one shot on it to drop items &amp; that you would have to be actually working with everyone else if you want to be rewarded. They never did that yet, I don't think.
---
They have to keep selling us stuff instead of adding it to the game. Less than 50 items have been added to the game since release. Over 400 to the store.
---
lol, here in Australia we call these ‚Äúbubblers‚Äù.  No wonder I could never find the thing
---
Yeah, it's like when you go to the electronics store to buy a TV, and they want you to pay for it! You scream at them that you've already purchased a TV at the same store LAST YEAR, so you deserve a new TV for free! But those greedy, minimum wage fat cats at the electronic store don't care. All they care about is feeding their families and keeping the business operational.
---
Uninstall and regret paying for 1st. You got ripped off.
---
I love trap bases or bases which purposely have their vendors unreachable...I‚Äôll happily store my junk and blow my way in or out.
---
That would be neat. Im no programmer so my mind isnt used to broadening up that portion of my thinker. Itd be cool to see something like that happen. It's kinda reminiscent to when older game consoles like in the NES days coming out. Promising these really cool things and while some being successful, some are just lost to time.
---
I have 1...I like my raider gas mask too much and unfortunately they can‚Äôt be worn together :(
---
The rewards are RNG so it doesnt work as a ladder system. The technical documents you cant turn in can be sold so just sell them to vendor bots, they arent worth a lot but it's something and will free up the confusion. That bug or change has been around for a while now. It acts like once you use them (complete the quest) they stay in your inventory and cant be turned in again. Along those lines dont buy technical documents from player vendors because you dont know if they can be turned in or not.
---
You are most definitely the OP in the context of the thread I commented on.
---
Casual observation should make it clear that I did not reply to the parent, of which most definitely you are not the OP.
---
Given the nature of your 'educated perspective' however I can see how these nuances may escape you.
---
Hi, thank you for your comment. It was very helpful! But I am sorry to inform you that it will not impact the post in any way because it doesn't require any change considering it is supposed to be one paragraph. Have a great day :)
---
THe exchange will contain 2 billion missles, nukes, .38, syringer ammo and .50 round balls and nothing else.
---
We can blame both since Beth do nothing about it while they can, and the guy insta killing everything is perfectly aware of what he's doing.
---
Don't try to defende scumbags; they will always try to end other's game.
---
Ah, my bad. It's been a while since I modded one myself.
---
&lt;3
---
or.. hoard less shit
---
It is frustrating hopefully they fix that in events soon.  I recommend a Tesla rifle for those events for now, helps you get a tag on legendaries easier.
---
Devil's advocate... but it is called the "Free States Survivalist Pip-Boy Paint" after all, you should have expected there to be something Free States about it other than just a color associated with them.  If they were going to release a plain blue pip boy paint they'd just call it "Blue Pip-Boy Paint"
---
If you're not happy with it just ask for a refund, pretty sure that's what people did when the Free States stuff first released and there used to be a big logo on the front of one of the outfits that wasn't visible in the display images.
---
I have been working on two new character builds. One of them is an energy rifle build without power armor and the other is a bloody chef bloodied build. 
---
When i'm not doing that, I usually launch encrypted and doing the scorched earth, or uranium fever events.
---
Unlimited scrap doesn't have any kind of impact on server stability due to the fact that 1000 things of steel is just one steel with the number 1000 by it. 1000 weapons on the other hand is 1000 separate things that the server has to account for. Even if they're all the exact same level 10 pistol or whatever.
---
You have run out of arguments on the matter of how modern industrial processes relate to magical properties of objects that defy the laws of physics, I get it.
---
I hope you don't make your money from space exploration related industries, I still hope to see human colonies in Mars before I die.
---
Sad it's just filler content, at least now we know you dont have to wait an eternity if you miss something on the store. We had to wait for too long to get a chance to buy the brassy assassin personality on ESO and who knows when will it come back again.
---
Not saying this what you encountered, but if anyone else is there they can empty containers and you won't be able to. I feel like this should be"instanced" loot.
---
You arent talking about junk. You are talking about weapons and armor that have individual coding pieces attatched to them with what rolls and mods you have. Junk is probably a string of binary code and when you insert pieces into your stash it multiples that slot by a certain amount of weight. What this means is it is easier to hide large amounts of junk because you can just associate the scrap box to that binary string and set all weight values to 0. It does nothing to the server. The problem with weapons, armor, display pieces, and all of that is they each have multiple words associated with them for the roll it is, the mods on it, the paint, etc. Dumping more of that along with the camp design would add a lot of strain unfortunately. 
---
Ever build past the budget limit so far on FO4 that when you walked to the camp the game was stuttering? That info was stored on your machine, not their servers, so imagine that with a full server where each player is trying to relay with the host.
---
If there isn't an update announced to coincide with a server downtime don't expect anything new to pop up.  If there's going to be any new Christmas stuff either from an event or for the atom shop they won't be showing up until the next update is announced and you actually download the new assets.
---
Yeah Im at the point where the gun I have is decent. But it only one shots friggin level 68 super mutants if Im in stealth mode and I get a head shot. I really want a instigating explosive lever action. That would be great. I wouldn't have to stack like 12 perks.
---
15 caps on average.
---
Started a new character.  I think the next time a Double XP event rolls around, may start a third (stealth rifles).
---
[removed]
---
Yea it was nice when they used to disappear. Just saying it's a free cap or 2 to sell them to robots so dont complain too much! üëç
---
I'll add and play now if your online
---
Hmm, interesting. Well I'd be interesting to see what they do in the future. I remember watching their live stream about wastelanders and somebody asked if they would ever increase the budge space of camp and he seemed to answer yes in a worrying way..
---
You‚Äôre equating a game company that lied about cosmetic only microtransactions and no subscription services to purchasing a new TV.
---
Where‚Äôd you learn that?
---
Does any kind soul know if the Revolutionary Outfit comes with helmet? I know the helmet comes with the bundle but the helmet is like the only part I want lol.
---
Most people have not been doing that
---
Because you're literally now getting those exclusive deals for free instead.
---
They never once said that these "discounts" would be in the form of sales on already available atom shop items, that's just what people assumed and never bothered finding out before they paid for it.  
---
The ranger armor reskins were supposed to be the exclusive deals.  They were exclusive to 1st members and were initially sold at a fraction of what you would otherwise pay for an outfit/helmet.
---
But people freaked the fuck out that they deserved the reskins for free even though they were never advertised as part of the 1st package and Bethesda rushed to give them away.  Now they've even released a second one for this month... again... for free...
---
Keeping the lights on lol. There are decade old online games on previous gen systems that are still up, and they don't have a greedy MTX store either. I think you are drastically overestimating the cost of renting some garbage virtual servers from Amazon.
---
Oh ok. Thank you.
---
Doesn‚Äôt work for me either.  I walked all over. On ground and all ladders too.
---
Same here. It starts to sign in and either crashes to dashboard or locks up and then crashes to dashboard.
---
My game is constantly crashing upon sign in on Xbox One.
---
Something like that happened to me and I about quit early in the release of the game. I was level 5 and just playing with the CAMPs in an out of the way spot. Some lvl 40 or so came up and kept trying to invite me to party. For like 10 minutes he kept inviting and messaging me. I explained that I did not want to party be cause I was getting off soon and then he opened up on my CAMP with a rocket launcher. Didn‚Äôt stop until everything was destroyed. 3 hours of gathering supplies and building a base gone in a couple of minutes. 
---
It took me a couple of months before I picked up the game again but the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù aspect of the game has left me wanting. Some are nice but most are jack asses that pull these stuns to entertain themselves in my experience.
---
I want the Nuka Cola wallpaper from the frat house in Morgantown.
---
I feel attacked
---
Blame the asshole player only. They did it not the game. Just because you can do a thing does'nt mean you should.
---
 Assholes gotta be assholes. And then try and justify it. Its Bethesdas fault they say. No gun shoots itself i say.
---
But it's not a huge part of the game if you have 1st. It's not even part of the game at all. So what do you mean? Get used to stash management but then buy something that completely bypasses it?
---
Shame on you.
---
Same thing happened to me- I literally didn‚Äôt do anything but visit someone‚Äôs camp - I looked around and went back to my camp which was within walking distance of his. He followed me and proceeded to destroy my camp piece my piece - until it was nothing. Then some fandoms who saw it killed him a bunch and he had the gall to ask me for his materials that I gladly stole from his dropped bag. Like are you kidding me? 
---
It never drove me to leave because I only had a couple bad experiences but it was disappointing that some people enjoy just being assholes.
---
Just out of curiosity, when did you start playing the game? Also, how much did you pay for your copy? From your post history it only looks like you‚Äôve been active for a month.
---
Really? The Forest Operative Underarmor has clipped through the Hunters Long Coat since beta. 
---
Get in Line...
---
I want 3 star legendary enemies to drop 3 star legendary weapons. Fighting a 3 star legendary sheepsquatch by myself and getting a rolling pin that has increased crit damage ain't gonna cut it for me.
---
Just got my first knight today.  My wait till wastelanders time/cap sink is trying to build my own t 60 from scratch.   I have the torso plan...lol.   2.5 k isn't bad if I needed the caps.   Think I'll have time to unlock it again before I get the rest of the t-60 plans.
---
Fallout 76 could have been the first Strand game.
---
I have an unread torso as well. Contemplating selling it. Lol
---
Isn't that actually pay to win? lol! I don't really care either way, but I don't think too many people are giving them $12 a month to play this dumpster fire. Of course I guess we'll find out in January when everyones + status has expired. Give them more money for doing a shit job doesn't really sound like a solution.
---

You can farm it like water.

No issues for me. Try clearing your cache/hard reset.

If that doesn't work, clear you reserve space for FO76.

But you should really go for the extra bonus.

No, but copying someone else‚Äôs story to try to get upvotes is a sign of a ‚Äòtrash person‚Äô.

Eh, I just started playing again after being away for eight months.  Sometimes you just need a break.
---
I had that happen. Junk on me just gone.
---
Actually it‚Äôs very easy to argue against practically all of OP‚Äôs points. Before release both Pete Hines and Todd Howard made it a point to say that all future content, DLCs, and new features would be completely free of charge to the player. There was even an article with a gaming site Hines confirmed that the cosmetic only Atomic Shop was going to provide the revenue to fund future development. The only real thing that is kosher about all of FO1st is the monthly atoms. Even the big ticket item of ‚Äúprivate servers‚Äù are debatable because you don‚Äôt actually unlock anything other than a coop version of the base game.
---
Yeah, but then it'll stay around for 6 weeks.
---
Yesterday, actually.

I would Scrip the Fatman, Grenade Launcher, Double Barrel Shotgun, Both Ultracite Laser Pistols, Exterminator's Hunting Rifle, Medic's Ultracite Gatling Laser, Two Shot Pump Action
---
The others I would sell in my vending machine for 500 per star. Might keep the Executioner's Grognak's Axe for myself.

Was sent in the vault graduated became a raider of the wastes I kill and take loot from scorched super mutants expect Graham he is cool and get leganday guns
---
lol I'm expecting more radio stations in Wastelanders and not behind paywalls. I'm a F1st supporter so that definitely says something lol. I think some features are fine behind the paywall like the tent and dance emotes, but something ambient like music?
---
I'm so frustrated I forgot to describe what happened. I tried to fast travel to Vault 94, because there was an Event nearby, but even though my caps were spent, nothing happened. 
---
My character was stuck in some creepy limbo in which all the enemies were frozen, and none of the containers had visible loot. I couldn't pick up items laying around either or interact with Vendors or workbenches.
---
I had to close the game and open again. When I got back in, all my junk was gone.
---
Thank you. Yeah, the original was my post. I appreciate the heads up.
---
I run red nurse with a monster mask under my strangler heart. Lol.

I buy anything that helps fighting the queen. Calmex, bobbleheads, magazines. Usually take one of each everytime so ill buy whener i see em.
---
Ok, so between my friends and I, we've turned in thousands of technical documents. It IS a ladder system - in order to get past Knight, you have to read the Knight plan. Otherwise, you will be stuck at Knight. There are 7 plans total. Unless something has changed, you can't get BOS I - Initiate Paint anymore (it dropped in late 2018, so some of us older players have it) , but you can get BOS II - Knight through BOS VII - Elder.
---
Expect to turn in around 30-50 tech data to get a single paint plan. With the right technique, you can turn them in, several at a time, but your game will likely crash after a while.
---
What? Are you implying because the weapon can be ‚Äúeasily converted‚Äù to full auto that it‚Äôs an assault rifle? I hope that‚Äôs not the case
---
Wtf, he just deleted this post. Either that or the mods took it down, and I highly doubt that.
---
 "a-holes spawning on events, making them harder and then not even helping" doesn't this already happen anyways?
---
We are in washout right? You can beat expert with 2 people?
---
I'd love to tag along with that. My group hasn't been able to complete expert on it haha
---
I am pretty expiranced and can hack the terminals. Also a fucking great clearer if I do say so myself. Though it has been a few weeks since I ran it
---
This. THIS IS THE QUEST THAT GOT ME CRYING, AND YOU GO AND SPOIL IT FOR EVERYONE?
---
I'm not mad, just disappointed. (Do agree though)
---
But the community guys who post here didn't make that promise did they?

I work in phone sales, so when the mobile network fucks up someones bill does that give the next Karen the right to come have a go at me due to me being employed by that company?

---
Tesla is your friendly tagging weapon.
---
Ye even i can admit that 1800 for 1 skin is too much, it should've been half that price so its equivalent to 1 if the skins u get from the bundle that had 2.
---
A better option would be to simply reward 3 legendary items to each player completing the event.
---
Switched to dead in the water today,  haven‚Äôt been able to do washout on expert yet but have completed dead in the water several times now.  Me and my girl have managed to complete it on expert twice with just the two of us, so shouldn‚Äôt be a problem with 3 of course we‚Äôll do novice and standard first.
---
Hey. I still reference this write up. Any updates.
---
Yeah..youre right. Might as well just make legenadries be available to everyone in the event if they got a hit or not. People are just gonna AFK anyway.
---
PA won‚Äôt do anything for or against your strength.  It gives you no bonus to your stats whatsoever.  Sorry to say but PA builds are vastly inferior to legendary armor builds, other than maybe a heavy weapon build.
---
Sounds like you were in the workshop zone and got ambushed.
---
COMMUNIST. ENGAGED.
---
I'm recently returning to the game and trying to plan out a melee build/maybe some explosives. So you'd recommend avoiding power armor?
---
This. You don't need to claim a workshop to be open for PvP. If you are standing in the zone when another player tries to claim it, they can kill you.
---
Oh for damn sure.  I‚Äôd suggest bloodied sneak melee. Go for 5 piece unyielding armor, you one shot everything. If I can figure out how to post a link I‚Äôll post my bloodied melee build.  And contrary to what most people believe, you don‚Äôt die all the time, heck I usually don‚Äôt even die once in a queen fight.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve seen some videos of it and it looks like it could be done!
---
Well, have you met them?
---
Power Armor sets your strength at 11. Even if you put 15 in i believe you only get credit for 11 without any power armor mods. I have a power armor heavy guns build i use and it's really the only thing id recommend for a power armor build.
---
Stock piling resources as I know settlements will need a lot of steel and stuff
---
Wait. The what now? Did I miss somthing?
---
I love the Advanced Riot Gear, it feels like im playing my New Vegas character!
---
You can still repair them at a work bench
---
The repair kits from the atom shop let you repair them anywhere, but will only go to 100%. The Queen will drop you improved repair kits which will repair your weapon to 150%
---
There‚Äôs a weird glitch so you won‚Äôt see the costs but you should be able to keep pressing x or wherever (look at the bottom for options) and then fix it. You absolutely don‚Äôt need to pay for repair kits.
---
You can use the weapons beanch to repair should be a option to inspect and i belive you can repair from there
---
Bleurgh..
---
Thank you, kind stranger.
---
Simply events
---
Yea same wtf did I miss?
---

The Atomic Shop was supposed to be what funded the games future development. If they updates it frequently with cool unique items, people would pay real money for them. If they csnt even be bothered doing that, you know things are bad. Dumbass.
---
Oooh me too! All this  so with this  i need more upvote for this..
---
I'm currently level like 22. I have a shotgun that does explosive damage. Its also low level so it does fuck all damage to the mobs. I use it only when in events to tag mobs. I shot a legendary 3 times and got nothing. Because it didn't do enough damage. And that pissed me off.
---
Spotify.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and there‚Äôs only ever like 8 people on the map even at peak hours. When I server hop a lot of times I get put back into the same map. Pretty shocking. It‚Äôs a shame because I‚Äôm still trying to jump on and play this game.
---
In general they need to fix legendary drops. Imo three stars should drop three star legendaries and so on
---
We have these beautiful wallpapers and the same crappy ceiling texturesüò≠
---
Are you suggesting that a little drinksh osh two ish bad fro you? Shouley not.
---
Pistols and one handed melee.  Woof.  They literally couldn‚Äôt have picked worse weapons to specialize in.  
---
I guess pistols could be alright if you could go heavy with gunslinger, stealth and vats crit perks with a bloody pipe revolver, or maybe a bolt action.  At least you can suppress those.  If only pistol perks were moved to perception...
---
I admire your commitment, but I‚Äôd be tearing my hair out trying to squeeze some DPS out of a .44 revolver or Chinese sword.
---
They also go in display cases, but are not blue there either
---
Can it have the "uh uh uh!" Sound from jurrasic park too... when newman locked out the computers?
---
Lol that‚Äôs what crossed my mind lol
---
I'd be happy with a ghoul slayer chainsaw. Leave the dmg alone for all the other enemies but give me back the 30 or 40 I had with 200% cnd.
---
it bugs me bc it looks just like the brahmin skull
---
ill check that out
---
I like to shoot her in the air extra when they downvote me...
---
damn
---
Bethesda has said they‚Äôre working on it.

If your on Mobil, hit the 3 vertical dots in the top right corner, and hit change user flair

If you're on oc I have no clue üëç

Stash Management is is a big part of the game. It was for me. I had to manage my scrap bulks in ways that allowed me to make consumables or repairs while balancing that with my usable weapons and scrip weapons while keeping under the weight limit. The stashbox relieves that some, theres still weight management to deal but I'm able to hold to more materials for flux production and additional weapons. 
---
My point was the games fine without the stashbox. I enjoyed dealing with the stash limit while struggling through the wasteland. However if you get to level 120 and are going to continue then it's a worthwhile feature.
---
Ok, awesome. This has been really informative and I'm definitely going to plan my build differently.
---
Destiny 2
---
Yeah, he‚Äôs been deleting a lot of his comments and now all of his posts. 
---
Running scared with his tail between his legs.

Wait for the *‚ÄòGuys, my little brother was using my account, sorry about that.‚Äô*
---
20 caps says we see that within 24 hours.
---
Exodus might not mean what you think it means.
---
Are 2 shots not good for vats?
---
My username is rhwillia1, i sent you an add request
---
I would absolutely consider using a gauss if I could cancel a shot without having to weapon swap or holster the damn thing.  The ‚Äúlet go to fire‚Äù mechanic is so incredibly awkward, as well.  
---
I was briefly messing with a bloody gauss in my stash today, because I haven‚Äôt used it in like six months.  I guess I need a biannual reminder of why I hate it.  When I switched to a Fixer with a reflex dot, I almost forgot how to shoot normally.  The gauss is so awkward in every way.  For a 2mm steel needle, the ammo is super heavy.  0.1w each.  It should weigh less than 5.56.
---
That hand cranked creation club version from Fo4 was great.  Slow, but at least it didn‚Äôt feel like driving with rear wheel steering.
---
I just had this happen last night at the Encriptid event. If you are in a team, go to social and click on a team members name and there should be an option to respawn to that player. If not in a team then I really don't know as I couldn't respawn any other way :(
---
At the very least I hope the new guass weapons in Wastelanders will be good. I will prep things so when it is released I can get my hands on them ASAP. At the very least they do look nice
---
Hello this is hella late but I just got one on ps4. I have it in my inventory and was wondering about its value actually. Posted it on a trading reddit I use a few mins ago asking for a P/C maybe you could help?
---
Look, they just don't have the sort of technology required to bring these sorts of things to the game screen.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/8457
---
I mean, no one else has ever been able to get it to work.
---
Yeah, unless you are a heavy gunner I wouldnt use pa
---
Legendary armor is much more powerful. Expessialy melee, using unyielding gives you +15 str for huge dmg bounses. Pairing that with a bloodied weapon and perks makes you super tanky and super strong. Like 1 hit ko a sb strong.
---
But I am a huge heavy gun fan. And would point you that way haha
---
Oh for crying out loud...  It was something surprisingly awesome, which will get needed...  Because....  Ahh damnit, nevermind.  I fucked that one up I guess.
---
I was the best and the brightest, so they built me a vault, then filled it with other people so I wouldn't be lonley.
---
Yeah PA is the noob endgame armor until you find good legendary armor
---
Nice info, thanks!
---
That's a good idea we need a new sniper rifle
---
I'm starting to lean that way after thinking on it. Do you have a build you go with? Still use PA? Do you focus on non explosive or explosive? Sorry about all the questions, just trying to gather what information I can.
---
Same.  I have a slugger build that uses pistols as a back up ranged weapon, mostly for the bonus movement speed with Gun Runner.  I‚Äôm hoping the gauss pistol will be a good weapon with a burst or full auto option for Guerrilla perks.
---
I‚Äôll swap into heavy guns for Vault 94 raids with him.  I‚Äôd like to give the gauss gatling a spin, pardon the pun.
---
I don't get a ton of server drops, it just seems to always be at the worst moments
---
YES!  THIS!
---
Your right but like the alpha 3star in arktos it's not one hit and done. I can solo it easily but not very fast. It would be nice to have event bosses be harder and not one hittable(easily)
---
Thank you for this additional info. I have anti armor for damage but need to find a working vampire as the 250 Dr is breaking mine apparently...
---
I'd like 1vE instead of always being 1v(4 player teams) as I never get any team mates
---
On PC it's to the right, just under where you join/leave the sub.  There's a checkbox (Show my flair on this subreddit) and your name under that, with a link to edit it  ( so it looks like longdongsilver98 (edit) - click edit)

---
That should be a link to my bloodied heavy gunner build. The things that are the least important are: batteries included, 1 gun army, lock and load, and glow sights
---
Knowing Bethesda, they‚Äôre definitely going to wait another 30-40 days until another drop. A paint is possible, but with the green one already released, I‚Äôm not sure which ones are left.
---
Its has an additional belt across the chest, and the ammo belt has been moved. 
---
If you a 1st subscriber, its...Underwhelming. 
---
I mean its free, but I don't really need 3 different colors of the same flavor.
---
Its like Neapolitan ice cream, if Neapolitan ice cream was just 3 colors of vanilla. 
---
I love my Stashbox, and Tent, don't get me wrong. But don't tell me 1st suscribers get exclusive skins and such when its the same thing colored differently over and over.
---
Stop repainting the same thing, and maybe give  just give me a simple "Thank you" and "You're Welcome" Emote to buy.
---
I'll gladly drop my caps on those.

Awesome, thanks for the information

Of course, just edited it with a bit more info. Any other questions feel free to ask. Dont know much about anything G other than heavy guns haha. But am happy to help where I can. Builds are super important

Is another display below it because if so none it than place the wall racks. For some reason when wall paper is on u need to place the wall racks first before other displays

I'd like something like a Barrett M99. Yes, it was created in 1999, so it doesn't totally fit with the Fallout theme, but something essentially like a black powder rifle with less load time. Since the M99 has no magazine and loads one round directly into the chamber, it would also reload after every shot, but it would use .50 ammo rounds instead of shot and powder, and it would have a scope slot.
---
Yes! I would love the laughter one
---
Do you know what grinds my gears? People have no proper mic etiquette.
---
I don‚Äôt speak freaky deaky dusch.
---
Said the anti semite
---
I came across Colonel's story during the BETA. I used to show it to coworkers as an example of how the game's storytelling worked.  
---
Honestly, it's stuff like this that enamoured me to the game so early: the world ended, and it didn't even have the decency to kill everyone.  
---
So people try to pick up the pieces, try to do what they can and survive where they're able, and the world keeps swinging.  
---
We come wandering out, ghosts among the dead, and all we can do is carry their stories with us and try to do what they couldn't: survive and thrive.  
---
Human history in a nutshell.
---
When you're at a workshop, regardless if you're in pacifist mode or not, you will engage in PVP if someone tries to claim it from you.
---
Yes, it is a PP reward. I think you pretty much have to keep all 3 animals alive for it to drop.
---
Thank you I would really appreciate that I‚Äôll keep an eye out for your invite. I‚Äôm lvl 11 currently
---
That is the issue, thanks

Please share this as much as you can guys , a friend of mine got scammed for a Tse laser rifle

The containers are empty for me quite often.  I just want the xp anyway.

With the amount of food and drink I have to consume, if irl I'd have renal failure, sclerosis of the liver and a ruptured stomach. Just the amount of purified water I have to drink should kill me.

Bought the Mirror Ball Plan from him this afternoon.
---
Remember to pass to the left after two puffs.
---
This game was designed for teams who work together for a common goal, soloing this game is possible obviously, I'm a solo player, but much of the mechanics is best in a team.
---
Thanks for the reply, but that is just it I did not claim the w/shop and I thought for PVP to activate you had to be the original owner of the w/shop so I am a bit confused on how this person was able to 4 shot me as I have been shot at by tossers when at vendors but it has not done a thing to me.
---
Not me üòä
---
Did not realise just by being in a w/shop zone was enough to activate pvp I thought you had to either own the w/shop or contest it neither of which I did.
---
No you don‚Äôt necessarily have to be the owner of the workshop, as long as you‚Äôre inside the zone you‚Äôre prone to get attacked. This game can be a learning experience sometimes lol.
---
But he tells the truth.

If you enjoy settlement building, I would highly recommend that one as well as the Nuka Cola creation club pack. They are amazing for creating fun unique settlement stores

I like trains.

I really hope that we get to see remnants of the Order of Mystery in Wastelanders. Imagine how dope it would be to see an agent posted in a snipers nest waiting for a band of raiders to walk by or witnessing a sole agent taking down a whole raider camp.
---
I was gonna upvote you until you called him a dumbass.
---
It really depends. If you get it on your first try the drop rate is 100%.
---
Sounds like your current drop rate is closer to 0% though. üòî

*A sense of pride and accomplishment*

I wish we could see this garbage house.

I think it has the -2 PER nerf like most gas masks so why get it? The Fallout First one does not but protects you.

I was trading with grahm on top of the world 2days earlier but Moomoo wasn't anywhere! Grahm mumbled something about him but not to him. I got worried. Where were you Moomoo??
---
Vanguards pairs nicely with melee junkies since you'll be in the thick of it it's nice to be able to take the hits.
---
My current cocktail that I live on besides my junkies addictions is Fury, Psychotats, Whiskey, Glowing Meat Steak. I will buy most chems under 30 and will pretty much always buy psycho or buffout for a bit more because I hate farming firecaps and digested goo.
---
I hate people not sharing legendaries in events. People did it to 2 separate legendaries last night and the same thing at uranium on the same night. Gives me anxiety about going to the event and so many people just say ‚Äúit‚Äôs a wasteland‚Äù and most of those people, that‚Äôs the only role playing aspect they appear to take on about the game.
---
You can pass a wire cleanly through a floor very easily (expert camp builder here).  In the power connectors, you‚Äôll find the conduits with pipes attached.  There are four simple variants: o-  -o-  -p- and + shaped.  There are these four with a connection for a wire pointed up, and these four with a connection for a wire pointed down.  Simply place the one pointed down on the floor/ceiling you wish to pass through, connect one pointed up to that downward facing connector and voila: you have a floor/ceiling pass through.
---
That was my worry. If you get people one shotting everything and/or people there on a team grouping it and no one else able to get much done, it‚Äôs going to be hard to do much in the way of high tier rewards.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.

You don't know how the burden of proof works.

Absolutely no one has to prove Noob is one person. You're making the claim he isn't, prove it. You're asking someone to prove a negative which is literally impossible.

NM doesn't cheat, you have no evidence of it, only baseless accusations. End of discussion.

I too am hunting for the Responders Fireman Uniform, I have the Fire  Breathers and the Halloween one, just need the Responders. Been running any events in the Forest area, hope to get it.

Inside of the Whitesprings is some real PS2 stuff anytime of day.
---
U dropped your power armor?
---
Lol You won't get bored untill you hit 4 characters at max rank. It's a steal for 10$
---
A little bit of 76, Modern Warfare, FO4  and Battlefield 5.
---
I started a berserker's build on my 2nd character I initially started because of the Garb of Mysteries. It depends on which weave you have in it, if any. The low level ones offer so little DR as to be basically naked (good for berserker's) but given that there's no legendary armor effects to help you... Well, nowadays I just wear broken armor 24/7.
---
Idk mate, I absolutely love FO4, but after putting around 60 hours onto FO76 i never want to return to it again, still contemplating whether or not give wastelanders a chance.
---
Have a bunch of friends who are also fallout fans but won't ever touch 76 with a 10 meter poll, not to mention one of them did buy it and uninstalled after 2 hours... so...

I have an instigating 33 vats 25 less fixer and i can do 3k crits and never run out of vats. It also applied for the first two to four hits because it takes a sec to register.
---
I think you‚Äôll really like it. 330 hrs of Fallout 76 for me. I‚Äôve thoroughly enjoyed exploring Appalachia. All solo too.
---
Not only that, but it seems when fighting the Scorchbeast Queen, if you don't do enough damage or join the event halfway through, and some other dude just blasts her with OP damage, you're often left without ANY loot on her corpse.
---
Often I find myself joining that event, using my legacy two-shot explosive ak47, pumping dozens of mags into her, obviously doing what feels like enough damage to warrant getting to loot her, BUT.. 9 times outta 10 I get nothing..
---
This is just not acceptable, this far into the lifespan of a live service game, and you're catching yourself thinking about even bothering joining an event.. And I'm pretty sure this hasn't always been the case. At least, it seems way worse now than it used to be.
---
So, basically a reskin/retint of the ranger armor for the 1st members? Don't feel like I'm missing out here :P
---
I'd like to know this as well. One of my characters has the poodle skirt haircut and she'd look pretty boppin in it.
---
I know, we need to like only games you like.
---
Okaaaaaay lesson learnt, stupid fucking idea though, just walking past opens you up to pvp what a load of wank.
---
If i were you i would update my ticket with the limited items you want to buy and sob story it in a nice way. Be nice and they are more helpful
---
Have to disagree. Server hopping usually leads to being put in the same 2 or 3 servers except at peak times where there might be a couple more. Really is a pain in the arse when your camp can't be placed.
---
Ok fair point

Holy crap. Zimmers! we have been nuking together! I haven't checked these in a week or so I stayed home with the flu. I think I even added you to friend list lol. shit nice to meet you in both spectrums sir you do solid work in the nuke zones o7.
---
It's really not a rush so much as a word of caution to perspective customers. I just think It's important that this is an issue that I've seen others on here having who have gotten even less clarification as to why. But thanks for the idea, I just don't think they would care. Otherwise they would just have delivered what was owed as soon as they realized that I was owed something.
---
I don't think it goes or shows higher in PA. Strangler says 506/561/440, so there's that. Also, afaik, any DR past 500 gets diminishing returns.
---
Did you exit the power armor, or drop power armor that was in your inventory.  Sorry, just trying to understand what disappeared and in what manner.
---
But if your on alien planets fear the 20 sider. At least if orginal Star Trek didn't steer you wrong.
---
What level serendipity
---
how you join
---
Interested in why? I couldn't finish fo4 and 76 seems like all the good parts of 4. Much better story and frankly it all feels like side quests. Voice acting way better... Darker sides of a fallout world came back... And running into arranged along the way. Fo4 was not even worth one play thru for me... But after the story why ever play it again?
---
Best fix. Make Events nerf the legendary effects of weapons in half when shooting Legendarys so the 1 shot guns can not cause the issue. With the exception of the Queen of course.
---
Take it straight out of the the big green/yellow pools
---
yes I know, still looking forward for those few things teased in the datamines. I was hoping at least ONE new item was going to be released. however, makes kind of sense to hold some of them until wastelanders drops - if one faction is china. when it comes to waiting I have the same stamina as a five year old :-p
---
10 bucks then the game would be fair 60 heck no, find friends team up
---
The 2-D Whitesprings flowers juxtaposed with a high detail dead scorchbeast lying sidewise in the air is my fave
---
So many corners and only one Vulcan onboardüññüèª
---
To be honest Bethesda Customer service is without a doubt the worst i have ever had to deal with... I hope they will fix it soon but i wouldn't get my hopes up they add atoms to you now... 
---
From what i have seen they only "step up" and fix the mistake when there is public backlash and the papers are writing about it and not even then the always do...
---
Hope i am wrong though en wish you the best of luck
---
We all loved it when we first started
---
I'll just have to add laymen gaming yongyea and all the other fallout 76 hate mongers to speed dial to get them all riled up for views I guess to get this issue addressed.
---
Did you check out [https://www.nukacrypt.com/solved](https://www.nukacrypt.com/solved) ?
---
Yep. Still last weeks.
---
It's weird, I've seen everything from photo-realistic textures to PS1 era textures in this game, sometimes at the same time.
---
Try saying fo76 is pretty fun in anyother "community" lol. For me it was best part of fo4 was after the story was over. I just couldn't make it that far. Searching all of the locations looking for lore or items. That's what 76 is plus multiplayer. Win win. Sry your getting the downvotes.
---
Oh, *that's* how I ended up with repair kits! I was really wondering why I had three all of a sudden.
---
Yeah. You cna get a lot from her. Just had to drop 100 lol. Still have like 40 or so
---
0\_o
---
I am glad I came into the game dark at hour one. I got excited when I saw beth was releasing a new fallout. I expected a rough launch and wasnt wrong. but it smoothed out really fast. I went deep deep into the wasteland emerging only to work and sleep. 
---
finally after about a month of spending every free minute I started looking to research and watch you tube videos. 
---
I had problems it was not a flawless game for me but man the drama was and still is at sitcom levels of over the top. 
---
typically I roll into any game with a good amount of research already conducted. life didnt let me this time around and it turned out much better for it.
---
I paid full price and have about 1700 or more hours. totally worth it I have 0 regrets and cannot wait to get off work and log in when I get home.
---
My current place is at the Twin Lakes. Near the center of the map, really close to Whitespring, access in water (a lot of it), it has a resource's place (iron i think), also a Behemoth Mutant neighbor for your daily slaughter :P
---
I'm still not sure it was worth full price, but it's absolutely worth the ten bucks you paid. Have fun!
---
this is something that a griefer would say
---
Don't be like this user, who was clearly so enraged by their time with the game that they stalk this sub to this very day, with the sole purpose of bad mouthing a videogame. Flee, before you suffer the same fate! xD
---
No PA has higher DR/ER than T51, and T51 has 454/454, there is definitely mutation going on here.
---
&gt; not to mention one of them did buy it and uninstalled after 2 hours
---
Sounds to me like the sort of intemperate and impatient goober whose tastes are pretty easy to dismiss.
---
What probably happened was you wandered in to the boundary of the Zone, they pressed "back button" ("Workshop mode button) the moment you did to "claim" the workshop, being that you was in the boundary you're are immediately contesting - Thus flagged for PVP, they killed you.
---
Agree, and it is not cosmetic.
---
of course if we translate this to a car accident im saying that the driver has the fault for being an asshole and drunk with a shitty attitude while you are saying like a pesty lawyer that he is not wrong but rather the car manufacturer could do better LUL
---
I‚Äôm still trying to get a refund after they charged me and never gave me access to the sub. I‚Äôm not surprised others are being bent over as well.
---
It's the same thing as a bayonet for a black powder rifle - if you find one at a vendor and scrap it you'll learn the mod for both the rifle and the dragon
---
Have you tried using the black rifle bayonet mod?
---
Why are you subscribed to a subreddit dedicated to a game you don't play and don't care for?

Especially for vault raids. I‚Äôve been having such a hard time getting even one person to help do the expert runs.

Forceful stock to have that condition bar as long as possible.

Codsworth might have been built to a higher standard than the mass-produced ones we're dealing with - he was very proud of his build quality

You should listen to more holotapes and read more terminals. There's good stories, but Bethesda just limited themselves in the way they tell these stories without human NPCs.

Hey,what's your platform? And if you dont mind me asking your level?

Ahh I see thank you. Do you know if any vendors spawn it or is it random?

PC and I‚Äôm level 346.
---
Incisor and Blocker are solid choices, same with any perk that enhances strength and is relevant to your build - for weapons an instigating +power attack weapon works well, but having a +swing speed weapon is pretty fun too
---
Does anyone who said a true about Israeli is anti-semite?
---
I absolutely love the game,  much better detail than Fallout 4. Besides the bugs, there are alot of bullying that goes on in the game, mostly from levels 200-300. Other than that great graphics and good game play.
---
I'm gonna be honestly I've really wanted the brick building set from FO76 in FO4 since it came out, like a brick house would be lore friendly and protective from the elements. I wish someone would make it into a mod.
---
do you have a link?
---
I feel like it's the lighting. Or moreso, there is none. It's just basic white LED lights making no kind of shadows and atmosphere which the game thrives at in other areas. To be fair though the actual Greenbriar hotel looks exactly like that as well so maybe it is realistic.
---
I say use the weapon you like most. Sledges pack the most punch but when I was low level  a really nice player dropped me a gift of level matched armor and a fire axe. That meant a lot to me and Iv been carrying and collecting different fire axes ever since. I have sledges stashed away as well but it‚Äôs just not the same for me and get by just fine.

I'm using hemlock, Grafton, and munitions, the rest are all available.

One shotting 68 super mutants is pretty good... I'm a bloodied sneak rifle/commando and my go to is a bloodied lever. A one star bloodied lever will easily get over 2k damage with a sneak head shot just from perks and low health. Add in revenant and chems and food and suppressor at night and crit shot....probably over 4k damage a hit at that point.
---
Imo DARPA armor from Spectral would be great inspiration for future design of Enclave gear.

Beaten wife syndrome.
---
Good to know. I just wish they added proper Riot Gear helmets we got in New Vegas :/
---
Hey mate, count me in! Aussie as well, IGN: Jesters7
---
Yeah, there should be different models for the advanced versions. Maybe they will come in next months
---
There used to be now they all share 1400 caps
---
Yes. No
---
LOL of course. I turn all short convos into 300 word essays. its an annoying thing I do that annoys even me. but if I don't say the thing in my brain and on my tongue my head will explode.
---
Sounds good. Add me mate.

I‚Äôm assuming [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9x6b4s/info_vendors_caps_reset_information/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_body) no longer works? Of course they would remove it.
---
Rule 4.
---
I don't pvp, ever since they got rid of survival it's almost Impossible to keep a workshop. I decided to do one month of first. Get a stock pile of resources and cancel it. This is my first day, I just wanted to share if anybody was looking for the same experience.
---
Welcome onboard, enjoy the trip and ignore the toxic rubbish.
---
Hmu if you need a hand getting going, but its easier now than when it was released and the game play is far improved.  Nexy year brings a massive dlc so now is a great time to start.
---
they are awesome but i have a hard time staying on my private server unless i have to semi afk it while i am doing chores or something. if I am actively playing it i need to be on public for the people watching and so people can shop my vendors.
---
I tend to plug in a controller with an elastic band round the right stick and go afk with workshops running, easy resources.
---
Yeah it's really boring, im grinding through just to get ammo, but I couldn't do this every day.
---
And why would I involve the government in some shitty kid's racist gt?
---
Honestly i get bored with the game easily but its a good relaxation/time waster type of game
---
Plus i like replaying thru quests with low levels
---
it would be neat if there would be new pvo modes tied to the faction system. Raiders vs Responders anyone? :)
---
agree with you on everything you said zachy but I dont like that explosive plasma gatling crap. beth needs to remove those legacy legendaries from the game. 
---
1. guaranteed thats a duped gun unless you actually are the guy that picked it up in a drop. 
---
2. put a splitter on it and you lag out the queen fight. get a group of asshats with plasma gats and splitters they can crash the server.  those guns were took out of production for reasons, a. they cause lag b. theyre op. 
---
throw that garbage into the scrip vendor and be a better player.
---
Good to know, I haven't subscribed yet but I was starting to get junk-stash-envy.  I'll hang off till after Christmas and see if they have got their act together yet.
---
Yep, I found that out the hard way too!  Too bad they don't display the workshop boundaries at all times instead of just when claiming or building. Now I check the map first,then sneak/skulk thru the area, you can still get tagged but they have to be in the area to ambush you...
---
What is p2w gear? Especially with damage caps in PVP.
---
Scenario 5. He's just being a nice guy &amp; inviting others to his world so that they may enjoy farming without outside interference. (No that can't be it)
---
So I woke up and saw that you deleted your post. But anyway what desktop monitor do you have one with 144hz? do you start the game ind fullscreen mode? does the game crash instantly or when you click something? does it crash only when the atom shop news shows up? there is a way to disable the starting sequence and atom shop popup -&gt; [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e33hpj/fallout\_76\_ini\_file\_and\_performance\_tweaks\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e33hpj/fallout_76_ini_file_and_performance_tweaks_with/)
---
There are some great stories in the game, Oxhorn does a good job of bringing them to life, but not having so many of them linked to quests is a shame, players don't want to read terminals they want to play. Fingers crossed Wastelanders adds more playable depth to game.
---
I'm also new too. Picked it up for cheap as well. Only thing I've played for 3 days. Loving every minute of it. üòÅ
---
 vyb 4
---
Forbidden Knowledge has a 30% chance to give one of the "rare" rewards (a uniform, outfit, or plan) and then a 14% chance for one of the plans.  Multiplying those chances together gives you 4.2% per attempt. 
---
That's a 95.8% chance for **none** of the plans each time.  Multiply 0.958 by 0.958 a hundred times, and you get a 1.4% chance for none to drop after 100 attempts. So yeah, pretty unlucky.
---
Interesting fact but one day I was experimenting with a hole in the map I found by the exterior opening of the Enclave bunker. I was on the hill above it and was between it and Whitesprings when I noticed on that server there was a hole in the map. I started to sink down and there is actually a few hidden assets that are out of bounds under the map. The trees themselves actually go down under the ground a bit... there is also random rocks etc... that are textured but you can't see them because they are under the map. I took video of it, I will have to edit it and upload it sometime.
---
The TV thing aside, games get free updates and gameplay content all the time. Much more content for no extra pay. What 1st offers can hardly even be called content to justify the subscription, not to mention single player/mod support was promised at E3.
---
I don't want to pay for a hollow game twice. Does that really seem like entitlement to you? I mean, have you never played any other games before that your standards are so incredibly low?
---
I get that people can still enjoy the game but going out of your way to defend these practices just boggles my mind. Fact is, the game flopped and this subscription is a way of making up that revenue but I guess blind fanboys will always eat that shit up.
---
People sell weapons and armour, like BE .50‚Äôs etc, for real life money. Someone people have made tens of thousands since fallout launched because they took full advantage or the dupe glitches.
---
Thank you for listening. This is very badly needed.
---
The mods being so rare ( I've found only two myself in the past months, I'm level 200) and the chance of learning so low, in my experience you're better off just applying them to the rifle/dragon. I've wasted some mods already trying to learn the plan by scrapping the mods, and I doubt if that's even really possible.
---
Enjoy it dude. Some issues here and there but still pretty good overall.
---
I've listened to countless holotapes and read plenty of terminals. My comment still stands.
---
Best community is a big stretch.
---
This thread is useless without pics ;)
---
There is nothing to fix. It‚Äôs just rng
---
I like grapes
---
Yes, it is possible. The math in F76 is quite black-boxy.
---
You're allowed to have your own opinions on it.
---
My reasoning is about 95% of the people in game are really helpful and willing to give you food, water, or stims just to help a fellow wastelander
---
I rarely find someone who's just hellbent on murdering everyone they meet
---
Ah ok. Thank you. I came across an old reddit post and a wiki that said it was 515/515/118 might have changed since those were made i don't know. It is so frustrating trying to find information about this game because there is so much misleading/just plain wrong info about a lot of the mechanics of it.
---
You're probably right, if I'll find the mod I'll apply it to my BE Dragon :)
---
I‚Äôm level 160 on PC and level 180 on Xbox. Between the two I‚Äôve turned in hundreds if TD. I have all the BoS linings from vendors and player, I typically turn in TD when I amass 3-5 of them, yet I have never got anything better than getting ammo. The RNG in this game needs to be tweaked
---
And im allowed to disagree lol.
---
Yeah, stuff that people have plenty of and will never use.
---
Warframes community for example gives legacy guns and the premium currency often, just an example.
---
Lesson nr1: never carry junk
---
I bought it for ¬£10 about 7months back on pc. It‚Äôs a good enough single player and I had one or two nice team interactions. It‚Äôs fine until you complete it, which frankly after 80 hours of play at least, is more than enough for me. 
---
I‚Äôm not one of those ‚Äúend game content‚Äù types though. I don‚Äôt get how anybody can stay in the game once the quests are over, but each to their own. 
---
I had a lot of fun, worth it for me. Never spend money in the shop though.
---
The third one in my opinion
---
The only things that I don't like about the game so far is that I can't have unlimited building space - I wanted to build a customized shrine for Mothman (hallow thy name) and that there's a FPS drop/stop during Scorchbeast QUeen fight, but that's most likely just a PC problem xD  
---
Glad you're enjoying it - don't let salty people who've never played the game ruin the fun for you! Community is great, specially on the PC - I've only encountered 4-5 douchebags, but they were in a group. Harrassing you? Jump off the game and into a new server :D
---
Downvote me all you want ,but HUGE fallout fans bought this before BETA started. You're one of those guys that trashed the game without even playing it.
---
&gt; If I pay $90 for a game people who use dollars still understand that is expensive.
---
If you paid $ 21,714 for FO76 would you think it was expensive?
---
That is how much it could cost in Zimbabwe.
---
You are not "talking dollars"  You are talking Canadian dollars.
---
The green hood works nicely too üëç
---
Of which around 20% is VAT.  The actual price Bethesda are billing is aound EUR 12.50, so it costs about 90 cents more in Europe.
---
Some people say yes, but I have not found that to be the case. However, ghouls tend to hear you no matter how sneaky you are. In general, what tends to break sneak for me is an enemy attacking. They get a shot off and I have to run and hide to get rehidden.
---
They should add another skin to the item and sell it again for those who missed it. Something like a matte white winterized paint or a matte tan paint.
---
Highlight the game icon, hit the start button, and go to manage game. Post a screenshot here.

---
2 shot explosive tesla rifle with reduced weight for only 5 dollars. google it. 
---
A. its legacy which means it hasn't been found in game for ages which means its duped. 
---
B. unless you are built specifically to avoid energy and fire damage a commando can just spray the ground with it and kill you and everyone around you. 
---
to find it in game through a drop is impossible so pretty much thats a pay to win weapon against 99 % of the player base. the only people who have a chance are equally equipped pay to win pvpers. (vanguard armor is 20 bucks a peice apparently) 
---
IRL I have plenty of spare money I could go into the pvp market for the correct well researched gear and just win win win all day long. but I do not support dupers and I do not bother people just minding their own business. if I see a lowbie guy at a shop I want to help him succeed not destroy his work and game pvpers are just toxic awful people and pvp needs to be removed completely from adventure mode. 
---
in fact miller time. even though we argue if we were in game and I saw you drop in the middle of a queen fight I would stim pack you too even knowing you're a pvper. 
---
there is literally no reason for pvp in adventure mode except to be a jerk.
---
" I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me

The radio reminds me of my home far away

Driving down the road, I get a feeling

That I should have been home yesterday,

---
oh and those damage caps are a joke to any commando build with anti armor and the right armor pene perks. three round burst is all any pvper needs to bypass the damage cap.
---
not to mention bleed and poisen bypass that as well.
---
 [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astroturfing](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astroturfing)&lt;--- pretty sure alot of this hate is manufactured by competitors. I know you tubers hate on games for the clicks pretty sure forum dwellers hate on games just for troll purposes or to deliberately cast a negative light on a specific target game and or company.

Faster swing speed! Makes those two handers into speedy killing tools.

Damnit that armor is my absolute favorite and now I have to buy premium again just to get it üò£
---
I‚Äôm always looking for more people to play with add me KSI ToxxicDucky if you need anything or just want to hang
---
Then why would I pay for a private server?
---
I was walking to my CAMP after a junk run.
---
They said before the game was released that it will always be online and they had no desire to change the code to make it available to offline.
---
Lol have 3 chars only got 1 skin

I use the raider skull gas mask without the helmet. Looks really nice.

Workshops are literally there for PVPing.  That is their intended purpose. 
---
I don't PVP, but I'm not going to pretend that people are doing something wrong when they are using content for its intended purpose.
---
Agreed with this.
---
The tan one
---
FOMO
---
865 people online in this sub now, a really low bar for any AAA game, surely everyone must've been wrong and fellers here in this sub must be right!
---
Can you share more pics of the outfit? closer up and back?
---
Yeah dude same for me. I bought it a week and and I'm completely enthralled.
---
"Blind fanboys bought this game before BETA started, before knowing anything about it. You're one of those guys that trashed the game because it deserves it. It was and still is a broken mess."
---
Fixed that for ya.
---
I played for more than 200 hours man for this last three months, stopped after the last event man and lemme tell you that after playing other, better, games from Far Cry to Outer Worlds, cod to Dragon's Dogma I dunno if i wanna come back to this buggy p2w 20 fps mess with NPCs and this is coming from a fallout fan. Wastelanders might bomb too, don't be surprised.
---
Sure, if you wanna play technical, I know there is an implicit EULA and I'm also quite aware it states Beth is not obliged to provide further updates but that is beside the point. You will find that in every eula ever.
---
Bethesda has also already devalued the game because of the horrible state it was released in and it is my sincere hope that the same happens to this short-sighted monetization scheme they call premium subscription.
---
But I have been promised single player and mod support at E3. It has also been stated that all monetization will be limited to the store, which is just not true. Yes sure, not by a signed contract, since you seem to like black and white so much but I like to think that promises still mean something. Which means I do need to buy the game twice because my mods are now paid.
---
But my underlying point is that filthy practices like this are what lower the standard in the entire gaming industry and I'm sure we can agree that the trendline has a downward trajectory. I know Bethesda has every legal right to do it but again, I'm not playing junior lawyers here. If they decide to pull this shit with every unsuccessful release and people keep defending it and buying it they will just keep at it.
---
A lot*
---
worth is relative to the amount of disposable income available. If it's a broke boi eating ramen noodles 60 dollars means a lot more than it does to the rich boi eating steak. 1700 entertainment hours for 60 bucks is a damn good deal for anyone I would think. being the steak eating boi that I am I also sub and sometimes buy random stuff on the atom shop too.
---
I never said I don‚Äôt have good gear. I said I don‚Äôt have p2w gear..
---
Mate, you gotta pour a hundred more hours in before deciding if this game is good.
---
I'll save you the trouble - Campaign/Normal mode: Zero replayability. One years worth of play time, one years worth of feeling like the developers don't give a shit about their fans/customers. One year of let down after let down.
---
NW mode: ok.
---
I'm really surprised that you are a Huge fallout fan but left it over a year to play.
---
You can't bypass the damage cap. 110 is the maximum damage you can do in a single hit. Of course automatic weapons are best.
---
There's a difference between what something is actually worth and what it's worth to you. If it's worth $60 to you, fine. It's still not actually worth $60 though.
---
Bleed and poison don't bypass the cap, because they don't deal more than 110dmg. They add little numbers very quickly, but it doesn't go over the cap.
---
3. on PC, at least in the last patch, the marine helmet is an ultra-rare random clothing world spawn. I've found one in harpers ferry.
---
Long as it could take a suppressor it'd be good with meüëç
---
Plus look at New Vegas, that game had loads of modern looking guns, like that M3 like assault rifle that took 5mm rounds, or even the OG games that had P90s and glocks and shit
---
This games allows u through u 2 afk getting scrap and most legendarys man. Even shooting the queen like 10 times then going afk with leave u with a decent amount of loot. Let somethings be hard 2 get. Plus u can always get it on the next event.
---
i swear to god it gives me cancer everytime some bright light shines in-game, it just looks like part of the screen has set brightness to 200% 
---
black smoke from generators are/seem buggy as fuck as the smoke itself is just a black glitchy square, even though the smoke from smoke machines are perfectly done...
---
this game needs performance improvements, especially on ps4 (non-pro)
---
The game is not perfect, but what a lot of people on the outside don't know is that the majority of the hate comes from the admittedly awful launch and the fact that it's not the fallout most people wanted. Really, even on day 1 the game was pretty damn good. I've been playing it on and off since day 1 with no major complaints.
---
Dear Bethesda, please fix your game.
---
Lol grow up. What about people sick in hospital, what about people on vacation, what about people with special needs kids. You don‚Äôt know other people‚Äôs situations so quick being a salty dick about it.
---
There is an endurance perk that gives complete immunity to chem addiction for 2 points.
---
Having multiples doesn‚Äôt change the odds.

And all of the extra technical documents that people have that do nothing?
---
Best way to describe Fallout 76 graphics: Inconsistent. Sometimes it looks about the same as Fallout 4. Sometimes it looks like a PS2 game.
---
&gt; how much clunkier number 4 is compared to 76
---
I love both, and will admit 4 is clunkier out of the box. But with mods... ooo-wee it's still the best Fallout by a country mile for me.
---
Wallpaper goes over the wall you have and doesn't replace it. If you have no roof and look at the wall from the top you can see your normal wall is still underneath. When you switch from metal to brick the wall does get replaced entirely.

I'm the pilot of the last successful flight to the moon. Grabbed some dirt from the surface of the moon and started my trip back. Came back, landed and here I am still wondering WTF happened?

Those people shouldn't get it. That's how limited events work. It's literally the definition of limited. So go suck a salty dick
---
I‚Äôve turn in hundreds on my main after learning the initiate paint plan a looong time ago and haven‚Äôt received another plan since. Not impossible but very unlikely based on the reported drop chances. I may just be an unlucky outlier but I always wondered if something is bugged since initiate no longer drops for whatever reason.
---
Either way, I gave up my quest to learn all the plans a long time ago and don‚Äôt use PA so I‚Äôm not too concerned...
---
Not as many as there used to be
---
Your Feelings towards the game are pretty subjective... I don't have any issues at the current state of the game that you're describing in all your posts. Maybe I'm playing different parts of the game, but I seriously can't understand your vehement critique.
---
Yeah, you get the designs added to your known list of blueprints permanently. Even if your membership lapses, they remain a part of your account. So you absolutely could get a single one-month membership just to get some ranger outfit plans, that big pile of 1800 atoms and then never spend another penny on it. It's actually a pretty good deal just in terms of the atoms if that's the way you're going.
---
that is the problem. we should be rebuilding. It would be nice to get some events like back on the beat, where we hack a group protectrons and protect them while they clean up a few train stations. after the event is over, the area is cleaned up and little 10x10 vendor stalls open up. or doing the same in a specific town/area then little 20x20 or 30x30 plots open up to build on, and your house can spawn in any open spot when you join the world.
---
Honestly, you think Bethesda will add the only outfit they have as incentive to buy first into the normal game? I completely agree it should be free, however that‚Äôs a horrible business strategy.
---
I want the suit
---
SliceddBreadd is my gamer tag let‚Äôs play!
---
Hey! I have been off this game for a few months now and I'm thinking of giving most of my stuff out to others who need it more than me, would you want some of my old gear and stuff?
---
Now now, why didn't you bring me any souvenirs while you were there?
---
https://disboard.org/server/628321653264482334

Oh I know they won't..

The issue that I have is when we do successfully complete the event the damn thing explodes and ragdolls and i can never find the body.
---
Are you saying all ghouls smell terrible? tHaT's RaCiSt

It's 1650 Atoms a month, but still a pretty good deal, especially if you're already spending your money in the Atom Shop every month.

Until I meet one that doesn't try to kill me I have to stand by my statement. lol

Theres a acid node over by artkos pharma. Try to place your camp there.

If you are inside of a Workshop zone during Claiming, or Contesting by anyone, then you are open to PvP, regardless of who is Claiming or Contesting.

For ten dollars the game is totally worth it, I unfortunately was dumb enough to pay eighty

Optimized servos (chest/torso mod) are +2 Str.

Calibrated shocks give +50 carry weight per leg.  Excavator gives another 100# carry bonus on top of that.
---
It's not "hard" to be in the right room when the legendary spawns during uranium fever and it's not "hard" to drop it before it knows you're there. You're not talking about difficulty you're talking about getting lucky, and then being such a dick about it you decide you don't want anyone else to get a prize, just cause you happened to see it first. That's not skill. There's no skill in that at all. It's a dumb system. If I kill every trash mob but can't get to the legendary before someone else kills it in 1 shot that's not "these legendaries are hard to get" that's just stupid luck combined with a dick with a superiority complex.
---
That‚Äôs why I got it. The stipend works out cheaper in the long run (for me and what I used to spend
---
Pre-1st) and the outfits / scrap box were just an added bonus.
---
Hey! If you ever want to play pm me I can build you weapons armor and a backpack depending on your level!  I remember my first time playing! It was a blast finding weapons too high for me!üòÉ
---
Yeah but it isn't good gameplay, good gameplay means being involved. You don't wanna be involved. Thats the issue
---
I have... two of these issues. The quest markers and sometimes the enemy bodies. That's it. 
---
I just don't have the lag issues, neither the random logouts. They were there in the beginning, certainly - but now gone. 
---
What platform are you on? I'm on PS4.
---
Its only for lead lined limbs and BPR bayonet.
---
You can also get someone to craft you some that are already modded for the chance at it.
---
BPR is a 20% chance, robot is .7%
---
Idk if im just unlucky but fast travel malfunctions a lot for me on pc
---
It‚Äôs only malfunctioned once for me and that was recently. Other than that, not at all! I‚Äôve only heard of issues with fast travelling on consoles until now.
---
thx for info, good to know.
---
Yea, I collected both skulls to put in one of my display cases.  Side by side, they appeared to be identical.
---
Another one is a terra cotta teapot with a flower type design named "teapot" and an identical one (I think is) named "Huffwarbler teapot"
---
How does this effect you?
---
I'd be down for it don't get me wrong but that gun has been done to death ever since COD4, it is a wicked piece of kit but fallout has always embraced the less common or outright made up gun models
---
Haven't found that one...
---
I did find a cow magnet though.
---
the lucky hole mine is what he is talking about and with excavator armor you can do a run almost as fast as a silo run and come out with 400+ lbs of lead + steel
---
No i fajnie :)
---
Or :)
---
Good gameplay effects everyone, it's a wide aspect of the game. Being able 2 afk at events would mean less involvement from people which would in turn mean less of a community gather for such events if u could just afk in them. So it would generally affect the game
---
Hiking around the map working on obtaining multiple possum badges.
---
That's not what he's saying lol
---
Not true people would form tribes or die alone , you know like in all the post apocalyptic books and shows.  Groups would enable you to do the events.
---
My point being that they are pretty damn useless so why fix a bug that gives even more of a useless item?
---
Max it, and max blocker.
---
As a long time fallout player, you've just made me finally buy it. See you in the wastes.
---
Due to having the Healing factor mutation, I don't really use that many stimpacks.  I typically collect a lot more than I actually use.
---
Repeatedly running the WS cottage circuit and looting everything from every critter and not really paying attention to weight - at one point, I had well over 300 combined radx, radaway, stimpacks, and diluted versions thereof.  Made a good amount at the bot vendor...
---
Now, I occasionally make the diluted version, but still hold about 50.
---
Only if you have friends. My experience in survival mode was that everyone just shot as soon as they saw you, they were using stealthboys and explosive plasma Gatling guns.
---
Well, those femme fatales relies on subtlety and surprise. Sure, they were very skilled in martial arts and other kinds of combat, but they didn't have actual superpowers to help them even the odds when things went south. A raider group knowing that a Mistress of Mystery is comming can set up an ambush and there isn't much of "badass femme fatale" that can protect you from hailstorm of bullets comming from all directions.  
---
So yes, all it took was one spoiled brat that was leaking the information. The information that broke the subtlety and concealment that the Order depended on. The information "where" and "when" completely turned the tide. Think of it like a spy agency or a secret service burreau. The worst that can happen to them is someone leaking the names and locations of agents....
---
You should. There are people who mis-clicked and bought certain Atom Shop items by mistake, and even after the Support refunded the Atoms, in every case they could still keep the originally purchased items.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if some of these assholes are obsidian employees
---
If i remember correctly there isn't a cure for the plague but you inoculate yourself against it before doing the Firebreather stuff. It's when you have to collect the DNA of a ghoul, wolf, and molerat at the hospital in Charleston. Keep in mind all of this could be wrong. All the youtubers that i watch lore videos on don't touch this game unfortunately.
---
Oohhh, all serums??  I'll be sure to come shopping your vendor....  there's a couple I'm after, and need backup copy.    Where's your camp?
---
Have you seen anything in the data mines that peeked your interest? Commie bundle or something else?
---
But... Free caps....???
---
All the more reason to work together. Pvp literally costs my attackers resources. Even when they win.  That same attacker could offer to buy or even get free help with a wave and voice request. Fighting in this game is incredibly stupid and non product
---
 ive
---
That's one big NOPE from me. Arachnophobiac here, so my stance will always be no. It's quite refreshing that Fallout has stayed away from giant spiders so far. Sometimes I feel that people think that giant spiders are the most fantasy and most post-apo thing ever. I can't think of a fantasy world that doesn't have giant spiders...
---
Glad you like it OP.  I think the setting and map is fantastic.  My main problem with the game is the crappy server system they use making combat atrocious compared to Fallout 4.  So bad, IMO that if forces you into Power Armor rather than a ninja/sniper build that has you spending all your time crafting ammo and repairing your armor.
---
The sonic generators were made to ward the scorched away but it did the different thing and dew the scorched to them
---
Not to mention all the efficiency lost to pve due to running a pvp build. Dumbest of the dumb.
---
I dont have any of these issues. There were a few I had like 6 months ago (server disconnect, lagging) but it has been a very long time. This statement almost makes me think you have not touched the game in a while. The only issue I have with any mildly consistent basis is the dreaded "Your CAMP cannot spawn because someone else's is in that location" issue.
---
Yeah, do whichever you like. It's your discretionary income. Just put it wherever you think will make you happiest.
---
Welcome to the Wasteland! Lots of great advice for a newcomer, mine would be to get started on the tadpoles questline. You will accomplish a fair bit of the tasks without realizing it and reduce the eventual grind when you want to complete it.
---
Reality is actually a computer program with high end graphics and everyone is variating degrees of AI.
---
It‚Äôs kind of weird how upset you are getting because someone killed you in a video game. Without PvP the ammo factory would never be available because people would just sit on it forever without fear.
---
I would add blocker (-45% melee damage taken at rank 3), and concentrated fire for anyone who uses VATS. Fireproof is useful, but might not be essential if you have dense armor. At least one is recommended though to survive things like robot and car explosions.
---
Personally I don't run with class freak since the negative effects of the mutations I have really arent that bad. Those 3 points can be used better imo xD Also, Scrapper kinda suck since it only affect weapons and such and not junk. :) That's just me though
---
If it seems to happen mostly on console it might be because sometimes i have rather fast load times, most of the time it happens when i‚Äôve just joined a server and that ‚Äùenemies nearby‚Äù thingy happens less often and it seems to start working if i run a little further from enemies.
---
And the fact is every one gets it but a very small hated and toxic portion of the community.
---
If you hate PVP, don‚Äôt take workshops... it really is that simple. Those are public resources we can fight over.
---
mostly leveling and trying to get some decent gear,as now my current gear is basically crap...
---
I live there now.  It's pretty stinky, depending on what part you're in.  Ever been to Minden?  We don't need no stinking apocalypse to start reeking.
---
But they don't need 2 participate, that's my whole argument. Because once they've join the event they will everything that everyone else does without having 2 fire a single bullet. I feel like I'm talking 2 a brick wall. Enjoy sitting on ur own private world doing events by urself bud.
---
This show is top quality, this looks like an amazing opportunity for anyone with the right voice.
---
Really?
---
I have played 76 since launch, and have never seen anything near Exodus quality.
---
But yes, the game sometimes looks good, and sometimes not.
---
Wish they updated textures across the board, because some of them are just bad.
---
Thank you! :)
---
Update: so I decided to try 1st. I am going on 7 hours with no crash, which is by far a record. I set up some workshops and using remote play on my phone to collect my stuff while I caught up on some TV shows. and got shit done around the house, exactly what I wanted it for.  Private world's are really lonely and boring though, if you could keep your private world going and switch back and forth to adventure I would probably buy the whole year. I'll just stock up a bunch of shit this month and live off of it for a while when my month is up. Thanks for all of the input everyone.
---
The slogan-shouting Red Army Power Armor skin indeed picked my interest but I will have enough Atoms for another bundle or more if they release one next month. Even now I still manage to earn enough Atoms through challenges to buy some of the discounted items and I soon get back to that 3600 At. level.
---
ye that group finding tool would be nice!
---
In fallout 4 the raiders drop a lot of F bombs, not something I want my kids repeating... Fallout 76 the robots are the only ones who talk, and they don't swear.
---
She was born in the vault. She grew up with the same friends, the same family and doing the same jobs for years. Everything became stale and monotonous. She began to resent the hope that the vault stood for. Depression set in to the point where "home" felt more like another word for "crypt" and she chose to take her own life. Hurling herself over the balcony only broke a few bones but the thing she remembers most was the vault doctor was the euphoric feeling of med-x. For the first time since childhood her life had a purpose. She would often sneak into the office for another hit to relive that moment. Eventually she was just chasing the dragon and it wouldn't be enough. Huffing engine degreaser, drinking antiseptic, snorting candy and stealing cooking wine almost did the trick but it wasn't enough. Her addictions destroyed all trust from the vault dwellers. The final straw was when a fellow dweller tried to help her and she bit off a piece of his face. She was heavily sedated and was not told about everyone leaving. They even held a massive party to celebrate. When she came to there was nothing for her. Nothing to feed her new life so she left the vault embracing her new self. She has been forgotten as the innocent child but now is the manifestation of The Hunger.
---
How is enemies becoming invulnerable when you use certain weapons on them still a thing?
---
This game has a lot of "how is that still a thing" moments. That's how.
---
Make friends, there is no real "Endgame" in FO76, it's an ongoing story with much left to tell, and the social aspect of the game is what sets it apart from other Fallout games, buying, selling, trading with, and helping other players is awesome, I've met a lot of really cool people playing this game.
---
At level 48 you are just getting started, with much to do and tons of areas to explore, I currently have Level 350, &amp; level 200 characters, everyday is a new adventure, with friends, sometimes we launch nukes, &amp; kill Imposters, other days we chase events, sometimes we take every workshop on the map (Public or Private), some days we all server hop looking for good gear &amp; supplies while chatting in a XBL party, sort of a divide &amp; conquer strategy, to find that special something that someone in the group needs.
---
I don't understand some of the people that say they are bored waiting for new content, the recent Lul has given me the opportunity to focus on completing challenges, quests, &amp; exploration, if you're looking for a unique challenge, try making Scorchbeast Mixed Meat Stew.
---
Best weapon I've got from her is a junkies ffr fixer.
---
Watch out for Wastelanders then!
---
I've been playing since launch and really had a blast with my friends and solo. Then I took about a 7-8 month hiatus and came back. Been playing every day since the summer and just constantly finding new places to explore or legendaries to farm. I've switched camps loads of times and ended making a whole new character. The game is really fun and I spend some time in a private world to make ammo in some of the factories. Can't wait for the wastelanders dlc!
---
Seems to be an across the board issue with all platforms, but you can still complete the event, by just killing the enemies &amp; unlocking the containers.
---
I figured doing the seagull thing WAS the game for those folks.
---
You're so far off the mark its ridiculous. Participation in these events has dropped because people can't get a shot on these monsters, and you're calling for it to stay the way it is because you somehow think it helps participation? Enjoy being in the ass backwards minority. No one wants this so they afk at uranium fever. Get a clue dude.   
---
You want people to participate but you also want to make it so there's a great chance you get nothing for participating. You must be a genius.
---
I assume random team invites are from pvpers and ignore them. Or if I'm at a queen fight I assume the person will share radsponge and I ignore them.
---
I work alone.
---
You know what needs some love is the Gatling gun. A new skin would be cool even chrome would work. Hopefully Beth can make it happen. Thanks for posting this OP! back to work..
---
You just described how everything works.  Everything is worth nothing till you put a value on it. I wouldn‚Äôt spend a dollar on oak aged scotch or craft beer. But my buddy spends 100 dollars on a case and I won‚Äôt touch a drop if he offers. But I‚Äôm dumb enough to pay 8 dollars for a yuengling at a sporting event. Because I like it and I‚Äôd pay for it over going without. The damn world runs on a fictional gold standard because we all agree to pretend everyone‚Äôs paper is worth something. There‚Äôs no core value infused into it magically because the gods said so.
---
Move ten feet, try again. Seems to work most of the time.
---
I got the same bug with the riot-version yesterday. Only had it when I was close to the cliffs around Top of The World, it disappeared when I went to more flat environments.
---
So I dont think it is that specific armor, but more like a general bug
---
XBL was experiencing regional server issues last night, and several friends were also having intermittent issues with their internet, many were able to play but could not connect to Party Chat, and most of us crashed to the dashboard several times, this is an XBL issue, not the game.
---
Most people who have been around since the beginning (including me) will tell you the same thing: the game launched with nasty bugs, still has a few, but at the end of the day it's still a fun game to play.
---
Tbh you‚Äôve been the entire time. Your response to those examples was messed up and so far I very much believe my response was warranted. Pretty shitty behaviour, have a nice day üëéüèª
---
You skillful sob. I am jealous of your dedication and determination! I hope for a Christmas bundle like they had last year since I missed that one. Love me some holiday stuff.
---
to bad its shit in pvp :/
---
Whew everything I just said went right over your ability to comprehend didn't it. Sorry man I can't simplify it any further. Re read all of it and maybe you can join the ranks of everyone else in the majority who under stands the concepts I spelled out easily.
---
Fasnacht Beret would get my vote.
---
Luckily I can change the volume on my headset, just the other day some guy's mic was buzzing so loud :/
---
I like the mire and cranberry bog
---
I enjoy the vibe of the Mire
---
Savage divide
---
I may be able to fit for you, I'll have my Mic in a few days
---
I have seen players drop lower level legendarirs to new players. I often insist they do not drop me anything as I prefer to live off my scavenge and trade. I have low level characters because i want to play different playstyles.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, boss.  I don‚Äôt carry a toolbox with only one screwdriver in it.
---
Yeah, it's working for me now. I checked the Xbox server status online and it said everything was working, but that was pretty early in the evening.
---
Evan Peters in his James Patrick March role in American Horror Story feels so Robert House, please tell me I'm not the only one who thinks this.
---
On a nice day the more is very pretty..lots of cool lighting through the trees.
---
You know what man I actually figured it out. You don't want people to afk and get a free prize. But on the other hand you have no problem with people showing up, participating fully, trying but failing to get a hit in time, and leaving empty handed. What you honestly like is no one but you getting a prize. Because what will happen when, and not if, they change the way this works is people will show up to the events more to play. Something you claim to care about but so obviously don't.
---
Cool, people do that in pretty much every game where thats possible.
---
Same here. I generally use workshops only if I start up a new character, just to grab some supplies, plans and XP. Take the shop, build a quick crafting bench and stash, then get the hell out. Makes for some easy fast travel points, and that's about it.
---
100% agree!One of the most satisfying and well written quests i've done in quite a few years!
---
&gt;Holy crap. Zimmers! we have been nuking together!
---
Lmao. Yes indeed, we have been and yeah, I think we friended...if not, clearly we need to! 
---
Thanks for the compliment...you do pretty damn good work in the nuke zones yourself! I don't know why, but I still love the SBQ fight...especially when the mobs just come pouring in, wave after wave. My primed, furious explosive, .50 cal. Was just meant for that event and I can't get enough of it! I'm not sure I'll be able to get on much during this week, but I'll certainly be there dropping nukes on the weekend! 
---
Cheers!
---
Same, although I buy weapon and armor skins when they go on sale.  I like taking gear I use out of my sell/scrip/trade options.
---
Not a fan of floating camps
---
I comprehend and totally disagree with you. You did not put together a very compelling argument at all.
---
&gt; doing the seagull thing
---
There's an allusion I haven't heard for a while, but it certainly fits!
---
Indeed its one of the many non-intuitive, unexplained features of the game. The learning curve for folks to find out what to do using the in game resources is brutally bad.
---
Time for someone to remake the Prydwin
---
In case it isn't obvious, this behavior would be part of what the community considers as toxic.
---
Savage divide is really nice for camping. My next character I am going to choose camp location based on wherever nukashine dumps me
---
Mire - excellent sounds, the light passes effectively between the branches of trees, the night is really dark, and travel between locations can cause shivers on the back.   I also like Toxic Valley - it really looks like after atomic apocalypse - scary, destroyed and non-inhabitable.
---
That‚Äôs the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever heard on this subreddit
---
It's kind of wierd how you ascribe emotional state to the words I have written. The word is projection. I enjoy pointing out how low iq the pvp player base is.  Are you projecting your anger onto my words? Tsk tsk don't be mad just think . Hell grahm even gets it. Go hang out with him and learn something.
---
The veil is broken in so many ways.  Once you get it, if you drop it or trade it, you can /never/ reacquire one in-game.  The only way is to buy it from somebody else.
---
The veil is good in-game because it can be worn without anything else, and it provides good filtering as a mask (other bandana's do as well, but somebody else would have to explain the perks of each)
---
I've used a mod called autoloot for a very long time.  It automatically sends any loot to your workbench at your settlement of choice so I never had an issue of weight.  It also autoharvests your crops so you don't have to spend 15 minutes each time you visit a settlement collecting your corn.  Made a huge difference to my gaming fun.
---
Why the hostility?
---
I could not agree more.
---
You can blueprint a staircase and a steel pole together and they are placeable anywhere. Saves a hell of a lot of trouble.
---
Ive had it since launch, i started by loving it. Its a new take on fallout, the only issue for me was my friends getting quickly bored by it wich led to me stopping for a while. Ive now completed the story and im only level 36 or something, i am really looking forward to wastelanders. I really think it could be a new start for the game, and hopefully bring people back
---
I‚Äôm in Japan and have been scouring 5ch and twitter and can‚Äôt find anything about this, at all.
---
Source?
---
Bought to hit a hard stretch at work. Just daily capstash and sleep for the next week or so
---
Kinda wish we had gotten something else besides another ranger outfit. 3 different colors and one with shoulder pads is BS.
---
yeah but the high capacity backpack is + 120 weight but -60 energy armor and rad resistance meaning you can't wear it into heavy radiation zones 
---
See I have a non power armor character who is my RP / Walking around build that I explore on. Then I have a power armored medic who uses heavy weapons and you need the stabilized ability to really use heavy weapons. Also batteries included perk goes from 3 weight a core to 10 cores for 3 weight it also reduces plasma cores / flamer fuel / plasma ammo / energy ammo / gamma ammo meaning you can remove a lot of things weight by using it when your planning on a power armor build.
---
Neither am I, but floating techniques are needed to get certain builds to work - particularly stacked staircases. Done right it's visibly supported, but the stupid game thinks the objects are floating with all the trouble that involves.
---
Lot of good Brotherhood lore here. Doesn‚Äôt specifically talk about the sonic generators, but you can clearly see their effect when you do the ‚ÄúLine in the Sand‚Äù event. The sonic generator pisses Scorched off and draws them in so you can kick their ass.
---

u/cinnst4 highlighting your armour in Apparel and clicking drop means the same as if you drop an item and you leave behind a paper bag. You're essentially abandoning the item in terms of ownership. Its also allows in the same way someone to take your armour. In this case if you left the world the armour is ownerless and abandoned in that world for someone else to find.
---
Clicking on the armour in Apparel and seeing the screen with the armour outline in the world to *place* it, retains ownership to just you, activates the 60 second timer, and allows you to get into it etc. If you fast travel or leave the world having *placed* your armour then it will warp back to your player inventory after the timer has expired or on joining a new world.
---
Yeah, their sizing mechanics are curious.  I wonder if a dataminer has ever dug into what is the limiter.  Is it weight?  A hard setting of "size for a display"?  Or something else?
---
uuuh, so creepy!
---
I really hope they take all the gameplay improvements in 76 and add them to the next game. Destiny suffered from this because they took two steps forward and one step back. Let's hope Bethesda actually listens to the developers of 76 and learns from their improvements.
---
I just cackled like an idiot. Thanks for the laugh, friend! lol
---
Hate mongers, I dislike them, too. But FO76 provides so much ‚Äúcontent‚Äù ripe for criticism.
---
it also takes off the OUTER power connectors ect too.. was wondering why my water purifiers stopped working
---
It was placed down in the world. Not in a bag
---
I didnt drop it i placed it down it was standing in my camp
---
Yes, I also wondered once why my neon letters were gone. Then I remembered applying a wallpaper.
---
The divide
---
How is it dumb when it‚Äôs a very real possibility?  Contrary to popular belief, Obsidian is a corporation -just like Bethesda- and their only goal is to make money.  They don‚Äôt give a shit about us, all of their decisions are motivated by the dollars that‚Äôll fill their pockets.  Considering that Obsidian is actually quite a large studio now, it‚Äôs not unreasonable to believe that they‚Äôre pulling shady shit like this on a regular basis.
---
My PS4 pro runs the game very smoothly. The only time it ever bogs down is during the scorch beast Queen fight.
---
Lol again with projection. Sigh we can be done it's all good at least you play 76. Hopefully survival mode comes back and we can avoid this same old argument in the future. Tired of telling the thirsty horse to drink the damn water tbh.
---
I have full slugger, martial artist, and incisor. Bloody mess in the luck tree also helps with just raw damage. If you wanna drop traveling pharmacy you should shop around for some legendary armor with aid weight reduction.
---
Wich is exactly the same as droping it.
---
I really love the Mire as a darker place on the map. I also really like the aesthetic of the toxic valley but it‚Äôs so bright it hurts my eyes :(
---
It's a brutal wasteland, and efficiency means survival.
---
I've LONG said to my Fallout 76 buddies that I hope a Sister that survived the massacre has reformed the Mistresses and they return (eventually) in Wastelanders.
---
I was playing with a friend (both of us new to the game), with me a level 20ish and he was like 10-15. We fought and claimed the Poseidon Power Plant to get some fusion cores and after we where happy with the cores we got we packed our stuff and wanted to leave the place for others to pick free cores that would pile up. Over the sudden some stealth prick climbed on a truck claims the workshop from a safe distance and snipes me and my friend's butt while still in stealth. What bothered me was that my friend lost his hard earned junk. Thankfully i got to store mine.
---
I have no problem whatsoever with fighting over resources, just make it fair towards the one that's being contested and leave him/her the option to pick an option: fight or flight! I would most likely just abandon and accept the loss of some caps on top of loosing whatever was already built in the shop.
---
I agree on the ammo factory partially but it's still cheaper and easier to server hop. Built up ammo factory costs 100 caps to contest. The owner probably didn't build it right anyway. A fresh start is easier cheaper and more cost effective.
---
Ah the honeymoon period.
---
Enjoy it while it lasts. That's all the way up to the point you realise Batheda don't care about  you or the game but just your wallet and you start finding all those annoying bugs that have been there since launch, fixed then reintroduced with a patch that attempted to fix something else.
---
Good luck hope you survive longer than most of us. Just don't give Bathesda any money and stay away from Fallout First.
---
Does the bundle you got specifically mention the XO-1 in the description in the atom shop? Some skins work for all armors, some are only for the power armors, some are excavator only and some work for all.
---
The ash heap.
---
At least admit that I am right about the fresh start being cheaper Mr post like arguing man
---
Happens to us all! Lol
---
It doesn't show up as a bag, but as a... Power Armor.
---
You dropped it and then changed servers. You did that to yourself.
---
Do you notice much of a difference without Blocker? I find that with my instigating weapons, most mobs are dead in a hurry, so it's tempting.
---
Yes pretty sure its T and x01. Checked it a couple times. Works fine with x01 jetpack
---
Power armour won't go into a bag, its the action that matters. If you use the drop action its abandoned for anything.
---
If you drop a weapon, its abandoned and ends up in a paper bag.
---
If you drop Power Armour, it is also abandoned, it doesn't go into a paper bag, and just appears free standing in the world for anyone to take. You no longer have any ownership of it.
---
I may have to message them.
---
The helmet is modeled, but it looks like it will be added to the Elite set that will be added in the future, It was a pleasant surprise that the skins for the regular ranger armor will carry over to the advanced, and elite outfits. so that means the desert variant will be able to be used with the armored variant with is awesome.
---
Hmm
---
You can‚Äôt scrap guns etc in it but the scrap box can scrap junk
---
Yeah, it isn't immediately obvious that you can name them, but it's highly useful to do so.
---
I don‚Äôt PVP... I just think it‚Äôs silly to call people toxic who take over a workshop
---
Just like you, Slugger cards, plus Incisor, Blocker, MA, and Traveling Pharmacy... swap sluggers for Iron Fist when rolling armorless.
---
There are almost no consequences to death in this game. Ok, they lost a little junk. Next time build a stash and store it before leaving. You live and learn.
---
Ammo factory will never be free if people don‚Äôt have a fear of losing it. Server hopping won‚Äôt do anything.
---
Cheaper? Things will never be available if people don‚Äôt fear losing them.
---
I got the first 3 paint jobs as rewards and no more after lots of docs turned in.  I gave up months ago and just bought paints for caps on Reddit.  I got all the paints I want now.  Bethesda should have made paints obtainable as rewards for missions directly, not tied to RNG.  I suggested this change numerous times over the last six months or so.
---
Most junk is auto scrapped when you place it in the scrap box. 
---
Weapons and armor can not be scrapped at a tent. There are no crafting benches in the tent. 
---
You get access to the following items in a tent: Sleeping bag (well rested), banjo (well tuned), cooking station (well fed), stash box, scrap box, free fast travel point.
---
The responders didn't exactly find a cure.  By that I mean that you can't find someone who was already infected by the Scorched plague and return them to their former, human state.  But you can inoculate yourself against it, which is what keeps all of us players from contracting it.
---
I also live in West Virginia. It smells as is.
---
ü§î Hmmm, if only there was some technique for differentiating one PA set from another ü§î &lt;sound of crickets chirping&gt;  üòÇüòÇ
---
I have a TSE faster reload railway rifle with a prime receiver on it. Before everyone comments on ammo cost for ultracite spikes because it is TS I get twice the number back when looting, it's a sniper shotgun and can take down mobs from a distance with no ammo cost and the weight is reasonable.
---
Only downside is durability.
---
But everyother TS weapon I have I turned in for scrip.
---
Cool will do that from now on :)
---
I get that can be frustrating! I'll pass this along.
---
It makes sense that the Pro would run it better. I really wish they would improve the perfomance on base consoles, because it ruins the game for me.
---
I've been on both the recieving end and giving end of this scenario. I've never intended to one hit the legendary boss before everyone gets a hit but it happens I've missed out more frequently and it sucks either way. I agree this should be fixed.
---
And a roof to jump on so you're out of reach of melee mobs.

I had this same problem at my house irl. We wanted to put wallpaper up in my kid‚Äôs room and we tried to put it over all the wall decorations and photos we had on the wall. Needless to say it did not go well so we had to take down all the shelves and picture frames first, then apply the wallpaper, then put the shelves and photos back up. It was a pain in the ass.
---
Especially when people are spraying explosive weapons everywhere like the trigger happy kids they are always take a toll on framerate...
---
It let you display a deathclaw egg?? I‚Äôve been saving them since I started the game and it wouldn‚Äôt let me put it in the case- which case did you use?
---
I also use an instigating sheepswuatch staff as my main weapon. As long as you're able to one shot most things I'd say go without blocker.
---
Not the aid one, you can find a cracked one in deathclaw nests you can display.
---
long long ago, way back in history....you couldn't.  And yes, sometimes you'd have to manifest 2-4 frames to find the right one.  Now, you can.  it helps.
---
I can‚Äôt believe I left out the most OP feature. I am much fail and major disappoint.
---
You don't hear that one very often. I think Beckley is the least used Workshop and town visited in the game. Not sure why just very gloomy down there.
---
Aw yeah I don‚Äôt want the cracked ones lol
---
I tend to play every day for a few hours and maybe it's cos of my timezone or hours I play but the ammo workshop is FREE to claim almost all the time.
---
Because of PvP-ers with sneaky pathetic tactics people are afraid to team up and play with random people they encounter in an event or stumbling in train stations. I saw some nice people in a couple events that saw that i was a lower level to tag the enemies and then one-shot them or whatever.
---
Sadly I got to see the reverse too, meaning people that one-shot everything in events and others stare at the dead enemy and they get nothing. A couple of days ago in a 'One Violent Night' event a 'random' player came to the event understood why I was turning music on and off and we greet the waves of ghouls with some lead between the ears. All worked smoothly until almost at the end when a third player came in and for a while things where fine (he got outside and shot some ghouls before they got inside the house but hey, it's fine) up to the moment the legendary boss came and he just one-shot it and we, me and the guy that took part at the event from the start to the finish, where left there empty handed. Or at least I was. I made a party invite but he denied. Can't really blame him. Thank you for your kindness random player. :)
---
And you're arguing a whole other point entirely. Have a good day.

Ok bro don't feel bad. I've been frustrated by this and just learned from you i can name them LMAO

I also have, Expert Slugger 1, Slugger 3 so I can mix up the Damage Bonus as required. Frequently used Sturdy Frame (Until I got my Zealot Scout set finished recently) - and When at the SBQ, MA3 becomes 3 Heavy Gunner Perks

They have a few spawns- they‚Äôve been around a while

I wish I could see Exodus, but on PC I can't even get it to launch.
---
It's really helpful for identify the three sets you've never-, and never will-, use, the one set that you've been meaning to mod out so that it can be used eventually, and that one set you use all the time (wait, . . . that last one is already being hauled around by your character).
---
And why would BGS fix anything when folk still pay so much extra?
---
I played the game two days ago. I also stated clearly in my post that I've encountered all these issues in the past week. So no, don't think that I haven't touched the game in a while.
---
Also just because you don't experience these issues, which I highly doubt anyway, doesn't mean that others aren't experiencing them.
---
i shoot into WS clubhouse with explosive laser from the tennis court and this causes the ghouls to come looking for me. my Sneak is 3 and AGL is 13.
---
anecdotal, yes, but works for me.
---
Agreed.
---
This brand of unrequited kindness does not compute with the level of jaded negativity and repressed daddy issues that dominate this sub‚Äôs community.
---
A+ for effort, though.  You get any takers?
---
If it's connection problems, then why do I have near zero issues playing any other online games? Sounds like they're Fallout 76 problems.
---
Is that the kind of thing they ban people for? I've accidentally done it a few times and will admit I spammed it the first few times I discovered it
---
I bet it smells like a freshly infected gunshot wound
---
I did not know about this either for a long time, but I was lucky enough to avoid ever getting killed. Nowadays, if I see a workshop icon on the compass, I just give it a wide berth. Knowing especially that opting into PvP would also make the other player and all their teammates automatically hostile to my camp as well.
---
Too bad there is no "workshop pacifist" mode, where the player can only claim unowned workshops, is never opted into PvP, and if someone else tries to contest their workshop, they just lose it immediately without a fight. Even that would make workshops far more useful to PvE-only players, who would only need a workbench and a stash box for a minute or two anyway. The way the game currently is, the benefits of a workshop are simply not worth it for the risks, except for someone who specifically wants to PvP.
---
I agree with this.  I have walked through *many* owned workshops without issue.
---
I can lure scorched to an area by firing a shot at that area, so it seems to me they're drawn to the place the shot hits as long as they don't see you on their way there.
---
I'm also on PS4.
---
Also just because you aren't experiencing these issues, doesn't mean that others still aren't. It's not like they don't exist just because you aren't experiencing them. No one should be experiencing them.
---
Did you down vote yourself?
---
I regard that set as the badge of suckers.
---
The mire. Although I live in the Forest atm because I run a shop, and want all levels to be able to visit it safely.
---
The fact that you can only purchase skins is utter bs
---
I love that tent so much. And through data mining it looks like we'll eventually get skins and decor for them as well so that's cool. Customize your tent to be a raider style tent, settler, Soldier &amp; so on.
---
Lol no, what's the worst that could happen, I kill someone and take their junk. Seems moot since I have a  world full of junk. Oh well I tried. I probably won't do this again, it was boring as shit and I only netted 10k 556
---
Why are people downvoting this post from ign?  Tricking or fooling people into a gank opportunity is a real possibility.  If it hasn‚Äôt happened to you at least once you haven‚Äôt played enough. 
---
Unless it‚Äôs a prearranged trade or purchase I never accept random invites.  Did it once and the team went to my camp and destroyed it and then killed me and took all my shit.  Granted, this was when camp damage was still allowed but you have to be skeptical of rando invites.
---
This! F sub items behind a paywall when I paid full price day 1. Leave that to the suckers.
---
And remember....bad smells from rotting flesh is caused by bacteria....potentially infectious airborne bacteria....yeah gas masks would be MY default too
---
It's really hard to say without knowing more about your camp.  How many turrets do you have placed?  How many lights?  How about crops, tamed pets, brahmin, display cases, etc?
---
That is surprising! I was totally waiting for you to say PC...
---
Well, again, your point works the other way as well. Only because you experience the issues it doesn't mean that the game needs to be objectively bad for other people. As my example shows, the experience might differ. 
---
But if you insist on your point and that the game is bad, please go on! I just wanted to try and offer you a different perspective.
---
Like my 3.6 percent interest saving account to by Netflix calls for mad tendies?
---
People still listen to voice chat? I just start a party chat with my buddy and we tune everyone else out.
---
Please fire Todd Howard.
---
I agree with you. It's fun to play with limitations and innovate. I will definitely update with some more optimized builds/stat allocations.
---
I have wasted 3 cards on that event, each time I am 100 pct prepared, full troubleshooters armour, chemmed up, adrenalin maxed and a shitload of stimpaks. Only to find that there are players hiding on the roof making it that much more difficult while I am grabbing pylons and sledgehammering whatever moves. I know I have to rethink my approach, I must kill about 100 robots but that sheepsquatch"s energy beam melts though me every time.
---
That‚Äôs unfortunate.  The real wasteland is here on Reddit.
---
What?
---
I do the challenges, caps, scrip, log off. I've been busy IRL though the past few weeks. Trying to find/adopt a shelter dog (oh man is that a process), bought a new car and been fairly obsessed with it, have to finish my bathroom remodel before we host Christmas dinner.
---
That‚Äôs what I meant by being within the workshop. Once inside, I could just hit V to take it over and attack you and steal all your junk, obviously.
---
For the price of 0 atoms, I hope.
---
I am returning to the game and had no idea I could name them...
---
I am partial to the Toxic Valley, since I live in the real Clarksburg. (And my camp is also in the Toxic Valley)
---
Well WW3 happened and ash heap looks the part, more than others.
---
By far I see the fewest amount of camps in that region.
---
only if they increased the budget from having a shitty wood shack to that scale
---
Thank you to pass that along. I have a lot of posters on the walls and didn‚Äôt want to do the OCD work of lining everything up again lol.
---
Keep in mind though that the game uses an accelerated time scale, if it is the same as in Fallout 4 and older titles by BGS, then one day of game time is only 72 minutes in real time. So, your character is drinking every few hours in terms of game time. And I guess sprinting around all day while carrying hundreds of lbs might increase the consumption.
---
Yea that sadly I doubt but maybe...exclusive to 1st only of course but I'm guessing the skins will be just like the vendor skins somehow and will probably cost about the same but as there's little info I honestly wouldn't know. Free would be nice though.
---
Thanks
---
No love for Gun_Fu ?
---
What platform are you on?  If you're on Xbox, I have around 130 stimpack diffusers and would be happy to let you have 3 of them.
---
No. Understand that the game is not based on real world physics, not even close. I‚Äôve tested the ‚Äòstealth‚Äô feature extensively with different combinations of weapons armors and perks. Essentially whether the enemy will go after you is not determined by how quiet you are, or whether you‚Äôre visible to them. They can immediately start chasing you before you fire a single shot, or even enter their line of sight. In other words, the game is cheating against you. Or with the right armor and perks you can touch them and they pretend they didn‚Äôt see you. It‚Äôs completely a make-believe system and nothing to do with physically hiding yourself.
---
I would never!
---
Oh yeah! I have walls of mounted heads and clocks and a love for changing my walls up so I definitely get that!
---
Thanks for the info!
---
It‚Äôs free to claim because people are afraid that it will be taken from them after they clear it out. Take away that fear and it will be taken 24/7.
---
I think they were left by the same saboteur who infected Watoga with the computer virus, as it talks about other things he did during that quest.
---
the repair button sequenced changed.
---
Select the weapon, then hit (on ps4, anyway) triangle to repair, you have a choice between workbench and repair kit.
---
IIRC, it is X to use a repair kit, and square to workbench repair.
---
There will be a point where you will have completed all the quests and dailies/events will be the core of the game, which is immediately where I lost all interest. It kinda leaves off on a cliff hanger, unfinished.
---
Its fun up until that point. I don't think its worth $60 or a subscription though.
---
"only played for 2 hours." "its great"
---
oh ok
---
access to what sub?
---
I had a Camp once where my turrets kept attacking one of my Water Purifiers, and they would destroy it, I finally scrapped it and built a new one, problem solved, I guess the original was made from foreign steel or something, damn Communist Purifier!
---
Can confirm.  I got a bayonet mod as an event or daily quest reward a couple months ago and was surprised when the upper left told me I unlocked the plan.  I didn‚Äôt think much of it, since I never use black powder weapons.
---
&gt; already spending your money in the Atom Shop every month.
---
Surely such a wretch doesn't exist in this world.
---
Yea i usually play solo in nw.  Chat is not usually an issue either as not many seem to use theirs.
---
What platform
---
It's cool, I set everything up, then just used remote play on my phone and got shit done around the house while I periodically collected my resources. I did do a WesTec and whitesprings run (No legendaries at WesTec WTF?) And a uranium fever event solo, which is one of my favorite things to do on this game, but I miss checking for people in the silo sites üòÄ
---
I got the first 3 paints on my first 3 turn-ins (pre only one TD at a time patch)...and haven't seen paint since.
---
Stash your junk first. If it‚Äôs a ‚Äòtrap‚Äô, you lose at most 50 caps and then leave. 
---
If it‚Äôs an honest offer then you have a free access to a private world and possibly make a new ally. 
---
The risk versus reward balance is weighted heavily on the reward side.
---
PS4, I'm about to log off and go to bed though. Ii should have specified.
---
It gets a little painful, no doubt. This character is incredibly stealthy; coupled with Marsupial, this helps with positioning, as does Speed Demon (also helps with reloads.) Voice of Set is pretty niche, the fire rate is too slow to stack enough stuns to even make it worthwhile against bots. There's no rule saying other weapons can't be used, I just tried to build for what was provided.
---
Yup, in Fallout 1st version you just get a tiny head helmet xDDD
---
Yup, 1800 is what they want us to pay for bundles so this is why there is a 150 atoms gap.
---
Perfect place for my cultist church.
---
I think I bought the plan from a vendor.
---
Once you get the plan, go to you local weapons workbench and craft a bunch of low level lever rifles.
---
Then scrap them.  That should unlock some of the mods.  Repeat as mats are available.
---
Could even be mutated from local copperheads. Gigantic AND venomous! Would make a real good boss creature.
---
Exactly how I roll. :D (Y)
---
Right?! :D
---
Off the top of my head

---
The small area of the Savage Divide right around West Tek that overlooks where the Mire transitions into the Cranberry bog. You can see Tangara Town, Harpers Ferry and Watoga in one sweeping view.
---
I really don‚Äôt want to get it, since it‚Äôs basically encouraging Bethesda to keep scummily monetizing the game, but that Ranger Outfit and Atoms are so tempting.
---
Going through the quest line, besides being male, I ‚Äúpretended‚Äù to be working with the organization as an independent contractor, just to keep the lore intact in my head.  The Mistress teamed up with the Silver Shroud, so why not?
---
Do what I do and use the scrapbox as a means to give out cheap bulk junk, 5 caps and they can make a profit selling it to a vendor or just use the bulk.
---
Honestly theres a lot of difference in how you can perk out depending on your gear. If you're doing bloodied with unyielding armor, you're going to have enough damage with the better two-handers that you can drop Incisor and one or two of the Slugger perks to get more defense with Barbarian and Blocker. If you rock Power Armor and bloodied you can drop Blocker and Barbarian and ramp up damage again and have room for Traveling Pharmacist. 
---
If you do a full HP non bloodied build, you're going to need all of the Slugger and Incisor and Martial Artist perks to get decent dps, but can sacrifice the defense because a full HP bar gives you a lot more room and time to react. Gear plays a major role in perk choices, in my opinion.
---
My bloodied 2h melee set up is this:
---
3* Barbarian, 3* Blocker
---
3* Martial Artist
---
3* Slugger, 2* Expert Slugger, 1* Master Slugger(You get +45% instead of +40% with two 3* cards, can also do 2* version of each)
---
Harper's Ferry Responder's bot have a lot of good shit.
---
Grognak Axe
---
Sheepsquatch Staff
---
Shepherd Crook
---
DIsagree. Scout with Polymer is simply the best and has best legenday att. including lots of weight reduction.
---
You're right I hadn't factored that in, not quite as bad then, I do of course run with speed demon without class freak, I do take a serum to reduce negatives on occasion but my dumb ass keeps forgetting üòÜ
---
Ok that‚Äôs the main thing was knowing if the staff was 2H or not, just wanted to confirm
---
I will likely convert her Gunslinger perks to Guerilla, and use a  Bloody 10mm Pistol Build once I get back to levels. Dropping Martial Artist for Iron Fist = Meathook as well. I'll edit later and show what's up.
---
Why aren‚Äôt you having your Mr. Handy hold everything in its proper position? Or are you some kind of commie that works with his hands instead of letting good old American steel and technology do the work for you?
---
I can't imagine that's a possibility but who knows
---
This is solid and I really hadn't considered it. Definitely gonna ruminate on this. Thanks!
---
Hopefully Wastelanders will fix some of the bugs that we had since launch.
---
I have both Full Health (Vanguard's), and Bloodied (Bolstering) Characters, both are Ranged/Stealth, but also suitable for Unarmed/Melee, My Vanguard's is Heavy Combat with WWR &amp; AGI, My Bolstering set is Heavy Leather with WWR &amp; HTD (ER is currently 804) I'm looking for 1 replacement piece that will get me to 829 ER, as it stands right now an Assaultron Head laser does little damage, and other lasers just tickle, including PvP.
---
The rolls that will work best for you depends heavily on your build &amp; playstyle, (+STR for Melee/Unarmed/Heavy), (+AGI for Stealth), (+PER for Ranged/Vats), etc..
---
The audio effects in this game are really superb, I have to give props to the original sound devs, I wonder who we are listening to each time we drink?
---
Every region has its appeal for me, really. For aesthetics and story I like the Forest and the Ash Heap best, followed by the Savage Divide, but the More and the Cranberry Bigs have this really great alien feeling and an atmosphere of danger and dread that make them really harrowing to explore.
---
We recently did a software and hardware update to our Mr. Handy to reconfigure him into a Mr. Gutsy. Much safer around the Wastelands, but he‚Äôs absolutely no help around the house.
---
The game is wonderful when you are starting out. The first few hours are wonderful and it feels like a awesome new world you are exploring. Over time the flaws begin to show and you see everything is kinda just slapped together barely operational, but I‚Äôm glad you are enjoying the game.
---
Honestly, private servers are the best thing to happen to the game for me.  Doing events solo is amazing, save Project Paradise.  I kinda burn through a ton of ammo on SBQ and Encryptid is challenging as a commando, even with a vampiric handmade, but the raid pays out pretty well with ammo supplies.
---
If you find that your private world is either shit for legendaries or stops generating then altogether, which does happen after a few hours, log out for 5-10 minutes and get a new one.
---
Your commitment to national security is commendable, Citizen.
---
Let the robots kill the launch robots and it will reset
---
So I like that we are getting dance emotes, I just wish they were not accompanied by an invisible boom box playing the music or the magic icon over the head too.
---
It was a pretty bad idea to make these emotes so intrusive
---
Agree 100%. I hate that the exterior gets removed as well. Mainly power connectors I use on the outside of my builds. Nothing worse than losing power to your whole structure when you change 1 wallpaper ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
My voice doesn't fit what you need, but this is a fantastic opportunity. 
---
Best of luck everyone!
---
there was a point in the timer where I thought it was stuck, too.  Had killed all the aggressive bots, all worker launch bots survived....Gave it time, it finished.
---
Have also read if one of more of the assembly bots are killed, they can still build the nuke, but it takes additional time for them to do so.
---
Faz is a great dude. Having run 100s of Queens with him,  you will have a grand time

XB1 and this happens to me occasionally,; doesn't really bother me though because I don't really want all the stuff from the containers anyway.  I just want those elusive plasma grenade plans as a reward for completing the event.
---
They originally could not be named
---
It sells for a cap
---
I did the same thing, the only thing i really dislike, is the constant gathering of scrap and weapons just to keep your gear in usable condition. I would prefer if there was no gear condition like in Fallout 4.
---
3 characters, Cashed in maximum possible scrip on all, and got absolutely nothing I could use.
---
About 20% of what I did get are good items for trade, the rest is going right back to the legendary muncher while waiting for the next sale.
---
I've only gotten 3 Fixers so far, none of which fit my builds, but all decent trade items, RNG for the character I'm currently playing is lousy, 3 SBQ battles last night all yielded 1\* armor pieces, in fact 14 out of 17 legendary items I got yesterday were 1\* Armor pieces, and none were 3\* items even though many of the enemies were 3\*.
---
Will do, thanks
---
Welcome to the Appalachia fellow wastelander!!!
---
Its awesome to see someone who loves the game just as much I and most other good folks on here do.  the game got way too much flack when it came out, i got it a month after it came out just because i like Fallout and i don't regret it for a second
---
the first 15-20 levels really got under my nails cause i wasn't used to the whole survival aspect of it (i played 3, NV and 4 but only on normal mode). it took some time getting used to but once you get a handle on it, man the fun you have is unreal. i started out as a solo player but now i'm a member of a couple groups whom have helped out a lot.
---
as for the community, vast majority of the people in it are awesome, i personally have gotten along with almost everyone i have come across, you will obviously get that handful of folks who just wanna whine and complain about everything or just be flat out D-bags but overall it is amazing!!
---
Bethesda only understands the language of money. Buy yourself the Tricentennial Edition or Fallout 1st and bam! Show everyone just how "veteran" you are.
---
I'm in the Forrest next to Camp McClintock.
---
If you use any mutations you should be using class freak maxed out, so the effect of the grounded mutation is reduced to 12% , not too bad. I use the tesla rifle just for tagging at crowded events so the reduction is unimportant. If you use a plasma or laser as your primary it's not a good idea, but you only use them for the SBQ then you can always pop a serum to suppress the negative att for the event. A little expensive if you buy them. On the other hand not many enemies use energy weapons, and even fewer are dangerous - maybe the assaultron.
---
I hope you meant the outfits, not the emotes. those were overpriced AF :D
---
All you had to say was Evan Peters and I instantly knew the role you meant. Perfect casting.
---
Nah, it's just that the game is poorly optimized. My PS4 Pro still struggles in places like Whitespring, Violent Night Event (for some reason), SBQ...
---
Does the scorchbeast not spawn if you build your camp there?  Seems like just about every time I'm around those rocks a wingy boi comes screeching in
---
This sounds perfect after hearing you talk about House in the lore podcast, can't wait to hear how this turns out and hope you get some solid auditions man. Hope to hear you speak on lore again in the future, even when I'm already familiar with it it's cool to hear someone else speak so passionately about it. 
---
The last episode from a couple days ago was wicked as well, I loved how Simon's parts felt like a return to the roots of the series, all the characters are great but Simon is undoubtedly the best part imo. Been loving the meta humour as well, the joke about the drill was hilarious.
---
Sometimes the progress bar freezes. but it still completes.
---
Todd is literally just the spokesperson of the company
---
Not going lie, I have not seen him in several months, I almost forget he was in the game, we need some kind of marker or at the very least give Grahm and Chally a place to settle down and rest. After all they have been walking for over a year.
---
follow the overseers questline.  It will keep you in more or less level appropriate areas.  Learn the lore.
---
Stay in the forest (west side) until L15-20, then head north into the Toxic Valley (grafton steel and north to the alligator).  Visit the pioneer scout camp.
---
Resist the urge to fast travel.  You'll discover more.
---
Do events - morgantown airport is a good one for lower levels.
---
Don't worry about building a massive camp - you'll end up moving it several times.
---
There are a number of other questlines you pick up in the forest or it's borders - Mysteries, Recruitment Blues, Into the Fire, Rose.  Some of them will direct you into the Divide (center strip of the map) or the east side (bog/mire).  Shelve those locations until you have gained more levels.  
---
Once you get to the divide, enemies scale to L40+, and will likely quickly overwhelm (and frustrate) you.
---
There are certain spots in the divide/mire where the enemies step down, but not many.
---
Judging by where people put their CAMPS, favourite locations seem to be: 1 Forest, 2 Savage Divide, 3 Toxic Valley, 4 Cranberry Bog, 5 Mire, 6 Ash Heap.
---
I have the feeling that absolutely no one visits the Mire, Cranberry Bog or the Ash Heap unless there's some important event there. I hope Wastelanders finds a way to make these places more interesting to the players.

The sonic generators were SB lures to bring them to the Brotherhood so they could destroy them. That was the Brotherhoods main goal in Appalachia, exemplified by "Line in the Sand" and the numerous fire bases.
---
Soooo. What are you wearing in the 2nd pucture? It looks like the armored raider helmet with a scout mask... can you do that?
---
I'd not put it past Bethesda to release a similar tent to non 1st players at some point, they'd make money I'm sure.
---
Yep, that is why I said returning. I could not name them the last time I played.  
---
Do you know when they changed that? Just curious.
---
I'm confused - So for the hundred hours, do you not enjoy it, in anticipation of deciding whether you enjoyed it retrospectively?
---
What about games that have less than 100 hours gameplay in them, are they automatically bad?
---
You can find quite a few laying around Aaronholt Homestead; just take time to thoroughly search every building and corpse you come across.  But, honestly, the easiest way is to do events.
---
I don't really make my own, except when I need to for a daily challenge, and I don't go out of my way looking for stimpaks;  but I *do* complete a lot of events and loot them from every enemy that  drops them.  Using this method, I consistently have over 150 on me at any given time.  Probably more if I look in my stash box.

The Mire, but honestly all the regions are cool.
---
Cranberry Bog is annoying because of Scorchedbeasts, and there is not much of a reason to go the Ash Heap, which is a shame. 
---
I miss the time when my Camp was near the Firebreathers building, so many new players passing by (before the vendors update). I've never built a Camp on the Bog though, can't imagine a Camp in the middle of that Legendary Scorchedbeast orgy.

Holy crap, great opportunity!

Thx!  Last logout, I was up at Pioneer scout camp.  Will start my Southward march (drawback of being overencumbered, can't FT) next time I'm on.
---
The Elite Set has another different helmet in F:NV.
---
If I‚Äôm in the US but mostly play during UK hours am I welcome, or is that too daft?
---
Ash heap is definitely where I visit least..but that for my own playing. We know there'll be a raider base in the Ash Heap, the motel in the Forrest near 76 as well as the Cultist, the underground caves at the Spruce Knob &amp; the underground car lot in Watoga. There's also the huge settle settlement at the crashed space station. So hopefully you're right &amp; we see more in the future.
---
The gear for mystress is pretty interesting as well.  For a long time it was the only upgradeable legendary effect stuff.  Pretty sure it's still the only hear that has a set bonus as well.
---
Did you get a copy? Curious.
---
Okay, sooo that guy must be an idiot. Lol. Dont get me wrong, its a nice garbage house, but that doesnt really look too realistic in my opinion. Maybe om biased becuase i play fallout. ü§ó
---
That's currently where my camp is. lol. Although I'm about ready for a move...try a new build.
---
All are welcome buddy
---
The non PC version
---
One thing I've noticed - sleeping bag in the tent gives rested, not well rested.
---
Still 5% exp, but only for an hour.
---
Sleeping in a proper bed back at CAMP gives you the well rested and 2 hour buff.
---
Still a huge perk!
---
Just imagine sniping the noobs in Nuclear Winter wearing that armored camo outfit, while you hear the distant thunder of Grafton Monsters stampeding your way...
---
Well, you can earn that in a day or so between daily and weekly challenges, so it's no big deal.
---
Yes it can go both ways, but the thing is, I see far more people complaining about these issues, as well as other issues, than I see people saying that everything is running fine.
---
The game IS bad. A good game doesn't have this many issues. Still, there's fun to be had here. But fun doesn't mean good.
---
Good call. I always forget that detail. I shouldn‚Äôt though because I‚Äôve been camping a lot in my real life and I never feel ‚Äúwell rested‚Äù after a night in a sleeping bag. Well not compared to my bed at home at least. Haha
---
For the lowest AP consumption, it is generally best to use an automatic receiver (if available for the weapon), reflex sight, aligned barrel, aligned or forceful stock, and quick magazine. Forceful stock has somewhat worse accuracy than aligned, but it improves the durability significantly. Also, the quick magazine does not improve ammo capacity or armor penetration, so there is a trade-off there if you want better damage or AP efficiency. In the case of a sniper only weapon for non-VATS use, like the hunting rifle, I would use a scope and perforating magazine.
---
I does seem tiny compared to the rest of that bulky armor doesn't it...?
---
You missed the point, but I won't get into an debate just for the sake of the argument. Yes, we learned our lesson: don't bother with workshops.
---
What system ? I just started a day or 2 ago and still have no idea what I‚Äôm doing fully lol
---
I'm not getting tokens from dross toss :(

Any town would smell like catfood and turnt pastrami, with under tones of raw sewage.
---
Not really that rare, I typically sell them for 50 caps, there are 3 locations I know of that spawn them occasionally.
---
Boomer is schizophrenic.. plot twist he‚Äôs the one planting the bombs. Ok Mr Robot.
---
I'm not suggesting it shouldn't be contested in PvP, I'm just suggesting it should be fair towards the player or players that are being contested. The system, as is right now, basically allows the player or players that wants to contest a workshop do it from a great distance while in stealth mode.
---
And he is litterally the crapiest
---
Ok thanks for responses. Im hoping for some limited xmas outfits
---
I don't think I can take down an SBQ solo. My best wepon is an execution explosive handmade, if I did take her down, It would eat more ammo than she's worth. I have been getting complete garbage from her, I had a Reddit rant about it a couple days ago.
---
If you haven't played in a while, it's probably because of a mod you're using.  They've made some small changes to how the .ini was set up over time and if you don't update your custom .ini, this is what can happen.
---
Faschnacht masks certainly have some exclusivity for the timing of the event, but that‚Äôs not the same as when someone would have played at launch. Seasonal events with cool loot are simply a way to keep players engaged throughout the year.
---
No it doesn‚Äôt, but even if it will that‚Äôs useless as you will get 2 exactly the same pieces and you can‚Äôt do anything with extra v94 armour pieces, all you can do is destroying them like atom shop cosmetics
---
Is one of the audition lines having him yell "QUAAAAAARK"? üòÅ
---
AFAIK, the only place you'll retain those stored items is at your own camp.  You may be able to retain WS ones if you stay on the same server, but after a log cycle, you are likely not on the same server.
---
As far as fusion cores go - you can usually get them elsewhere.  and with the right perks, they last a good while. (a 50% core lasts me about 6 hours play time)
---
At posiedon, there's typically one fusion core on the table next to the processor, and sometimes a plan, too. 
---
If you make the rounds of the usual PA spawn points (there are at least 12 in the forest alone) and static generator locations, there's often cores in the PA and/or the generator.  
---
For example, there's up to 3 at wade airport - 2 spawns and one static
---
There's up to 5 at camden park (event reward, ammo can, pa spawn, and 2 generators)
---
Line in the sand event reward them...some (non-robotic) critters drop them as loot.  Sentrybots drop them.  There's an event in the ash heap where you have to kill a sentrybot - you'll get one there.
---
Found one last night in a duffel bag.
---
If you have enough flux, you can make them at a tinkers workbench.
---
Some players sell them for about 1c per percent of charge.
---
I live in PA - haven't taken a power plant since I was about L17 or so....now L156, and have what some people would probably think is a stupid large number of cores.
---
Everyone else is a crustomer.
---
I agree with you. It would be a nice gesture to have a free, non atomic shop item/cosmetic as a bench mark reward. Or even something to show you were a BETA player. Not looking for special snowflake rewards or talking about old atomic shop items cuz that's not what I mean. Just a nice "Hey, you've been here since the beginning and we thank you for sticking with us. Here's a plaque/small statue for your camp".
---
Lucky hole mine for lead.
---
Free? I already paid for the game, which is selling like crap because of bs like this.
---
I think it will be more logical if some NPC give legendary reward for completing some task. It strange when insects or molerat drop minigun. Some daily quest will be cool. Like in eso :)
---
Ahhh, I see. I didn‚Äôt think about it like that. Alright, thanks for the answer!
---
If you take a workshop stay crouched. Problem solved. With damage caps, it is very difficult to snipe someone to death now.
---
I had the same problem before mine locked up but it wasn‚Äôt a consistent issue, maybe every third time I wouldn‚Äôt get tokens.
---
The point is you need to learn to not carry a lot of junk with you
---
My guess is that it randomly generates a quantity for you when you pick it up, instead of having one pre-assigned to it, and if you mash the button before that completes, you'll keep hitting up whatever function handles that.
---
Actually, I played in the Stress Test, which means I still have something to show for it: the Non-Disclosure Agreement. I still can‚Äôt talk about my experiences to this day
---
I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy my first play through as well, but now I just don't play the game anymore.
---
Mine was stuck on "listen to Zak" but I could still pick up the dross and when I tossed it into the tires the quest was complete and I got my rewards.
---
I would say the dark one with a shovel. Alternately, Raider Scabber or Waster one ;)
---
The best way to show you are a veteran of this game in my opinion is helping those who are new. There is a lot of mechanics that arent explained very well like how certain perks work. Offer help to those in need and teach them the valuable lesson that workshops are indeed PVP areas.
---
Savage Divide right now, but used to camp by THE bridge at the beginning
---
Yea. Thats what im torn between. Lol. I have all three, but none of them are just clicking for me. The black shovel one just seems so small in comparison to the outfit, and the raider ones just dont fit the overall theme of the outfit... we need new backpack skins for the ranger outfit. Hahaha
---
I tried that also but I don‚Äôt have the option to pick it up when I hovered over it.
---
I played the stress test, beta, and then game from day 1 and yeah... you're right... it didn't get me anything but frustration a lot of that time.  I kinda agree with below that the only day one perks you can get are things from Tricentennial.  In general they have basically treated players like cash machines rather than dedicated fans and I don't see that ending anytime soon.  Every time we have come up with a good idea in this community it has been monetized.  I can't think of basically any item that was given to us just for being loyal fans.  So I guess I am just saying I wouldn't spend too much time wishing.
---
It's kind of difficult to track down a consistent reason for this, but there are two things that I believe are true:
---
1. If a low-level player was there before you, they would spawn enemies appropriate to their level.  If they don't clear them out, those enemies will just hang around for the next player.  Any ones that were killed are replaced with appropriate levels, which is how you end up with Lv. 68s mixed in with Lv. 5s.
---
2. On a fresh server or private session, where enemies have never spawned at a location before, they seem to default to spawning at minimum levels until they are "corrected" by subsequent spawns.
---
they did change the most useless item in the game (burned books) into that of a junk item since it was a pain to remove them from your inventory if you picked some up by mistake. id just like it if they changed the classification of Gunpowder to a junk item so it will be stored away when you deposit all scrap in your stash box. when very few misc items in your inventory it is a simple task, but if you have a bunch of keys and what not it gets a little annoying (the annoyance can be reduced by sorting by weight, but still)
---
All Armors (except wood) can be modded with Deep Pockets, The Raider Chest is glitched and gets +15 Carry weight with just pocketed.
---
I prefer to run Dense on my Chest Pieces, and run mostly Weapons Weight reduction pieces.
---
If you're on XB1 hit me up in game and I can mod any armor for you (No charge if you provide materials), 
---
GT= Medieval Mr Ed
---
Scrapper should not be used all the time.  Its a situational QoL perk that is required if you do any kind of ammo making.  The increase in the steel and plastic you get from scrapping weapons sets the bar for crafting.
---
Hense my statement of " Not all of these are equipped all the time. "
---
Whoever gets there first is spawning the mobs at their level (there are exceptions, but that water has been muddled a bit as of late).
---
Higher level areas are supposed to spawn higher level mobs by default, but that's not always the case (I frequently see level 5-10 mobs in the divide).
---
From my experience it's either the connection or server the instance is running on.  The client side application itself does not seem to break much.  
---
Connection tends to boil down to how much is on the wire, sample rate, and if the net code can deal with errors well (rare these days).  A dandy example is mass effect amdromeda where host needed to sustain 800kbps upload, any blip and people would desync.  Loosing a single packet can break ya in quite a few fps games (primarily non-server based games).
---
Server depends on its load, bandwith, and distance.  In the case of 76 I'm betting the instance gets maxed out (i.e. nukes) and it cascades to the client connections.  Easy to see with public vs private instance thanks to fallout first.
---
Servers cost money to run and the game requires regular money to be supported for the next five years or whatever. It's also a competitive price, and really not that much unless you're not an adult
---
Please don‚Äôt upvote ro downvote Thais comment. 88
---
Hey I'm on xb1, I'll take you up on that offer. What do you want for them?
---
Weights turn into lead scrap. Pulling it out of the mine gives you ore. When you smelt it you can end up with 300-600 lead scrap per run.
---
Exactly what's happening for me atm :/ it's alright tho since there are easier ways to get more of them faster if I really wanted :) one day I'll get the outfit :p
---
And maybe, just maybe, for a small fee or subscription, you‚Äôll be able to display your PA and clothing in your camp...
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I had in mind, something super small and simple. It could even be simply a re-skinned asset of something already existing.
---
lol Captain America: I got that reference.
---
Limited? There's nothing limited in this game. Atom shop items ALWAYS come back and event outfits are duped like crazy.
---
It's not just the shoulder pads. The bandaleir has bullets on it. The pants are tucked into combat boots. He has a bracer on his right arm. And the jacket is different. There are supposedly another couple of variations coming. I'm happy about that of for no other reason then now there can be different outfits and when I go to a crowded vendor I don't see 15 clones lol.
---
That is very unfortunate. And confusing. Thanks for the info!
---
Thanks buddy üëçüëç
---
Its a build specific feat that many people I know and run with regularly dont use (my crew ranges from lvl 180-450). 
---
Not a must have.  Its more flavor after the essentials are taken.
---
I mean, lately it seems like I've only just been getting ammo. I used to get other things like maybe a weapon or armor when I turned in the documents, but not anymore. The last maybe 30 times I've turned in TD I just get ammo.
---
Concentrated fire makes gun fu wonky, some vats users dont use it.  I dont.  Its also a build specific feat, heavies and melee wont even give it a second thought.
---
Fix it Good and Weapon Artisan arnt used much by people at endgame, which is why I didnt mention as must haves.  The repair kits garnered from the queen fight take care of repairs.
---
Dense armor is not easy to come by, and fireproof works for PA too.
---
Blocker is build specific, and a waste of points IMO.
---
The worst part about 76 is definitely its lighting. It can't decide what it wants to look like, and worst of all is how artificial (Might be an oxymoron there) it looks.  They're using different techniques from Fallout 4, and it looks simultaneously worse, and better than Fallout 4 depending on where you are.
---
But pretty much everywhere, interiors look 99% worse than interiors in Fallout 4.  There's like color grading in certain interiors, and you have things like metal showing glowing from some unknown light sources, it's all very bad.
---
I don't know why they haven't bothered to polish the WIP nature of the game's visuals, seeing as how they've had almost a year to try and make this game better, but the visuals are the one thing they've neglected pretty much since the beta.
---
You get a range of enemies at random levels, the average is somewhat lower than yours, which is more like the upper end of the range. But once you are really high level, there will be a lot of level 62 ghouls.
---
Burnt books aren't crafted though.  I get your point (not that I agree with it completely), but the point I'm making is that it may not be as simple as clicking a checkbox and calling it a day.  If it's junk, kind of by definition, it is broken down into other things.  Gunpowder is the opposite.
---
I'd have to look at a bunch of mics items in game to get into more detail to see if it's that simple or not, and I'm quite a few hours away from doing that.  I'd want to see if there are any other crafted items that fall into the junk tab, and what category some items like the old version of the burnt books fall into (I assume it's under misc).  If item categorization works like I think it does, what you're asking would take reworking the way the game treats all misc and junk items, but it would take a bit of sleuthing to really come to a conclusion.
---
  I know BSG changed level spawns in some areas so lower level players would not have such a difficult time completing some tasks.  Recall what you have to go to/do to get blade of bastet, or the 'kill 10 unruly golfers" challenge?  Kinda tough for a L20 to take out L48-62 ghouls.
---
In those crossover zones, (for example, top of the world, lewiston, WS, camp venture) - areas where low levels are sent for early steps of some quests -  the default enemy level is set lower.
---
 Sometimes, the low level critters all die as soon as high levels walk into the cell, then respawn higher.   Sometimes, they don't, staying low level until you kill them, then they respawn higher.
---
*We can jump in the water and stay irradiated all the time*
---
I'd enjoy it
---
The Atom stipend should be higher. 1,650/mo? Really? #BadDeal 
---
I'll wait until FO1st actually has a good deal that doesn't include paying extra for stuff that should be free, lore breaks that ruin immersion, or paying for content that was free in previous games (looking at you unlimited crafting stash). It seems to me like FO1st is a terrible deal and only getting worse after they *lied* about not being able to increase stash size. (&gt;.&gt;)
---
What about the Nixie tube alarm clock? I‚Äôm pretty sure it was available for free early on and is no longer in the atomic shop, so only veteran players would have it.
---
Its not a must have, its a situational perk for vats users when facing multiple enemies.
---
Non vats users, or  a single target fight will not benefit from Gun Fu.
---
Its amazing, but situational.
---
Let me know when you can log back in. I'm working mostly from home today and can log in, double check that I've got everything and just be AFK.
---
Believe it or not but this is the most disappointing thing for me. Almost every atomic shop item came back a few times, all legacy weapons were duped to hell and same goes for fasnacht masks. That's what i hate most about fallout 76, buy it now for $10 and get everything that one got during an entire year. 
---
   Just look how everyone has the same items in their camp, same clothes etc.
---
Why was this deleted?
---
My buddy, u/Scorpion278 played the game. Refer to him with any questions or if you need updates
---
Thanks. I had a camp near Solomon's Pond for weeks. I never saw one, but I might have heard it and not realised what it was.
---
I was able to add the blue last night with nothing being removed. And earlier when when i went from the Grey to the Red when it was free.
---
The aid/repair kit crash bug. It has been around way too long.
---
i just wish there were some interior walls that i could wallpaper on both sides, instead of having one side wallpapered and the other a crappy red barn or rusty metal or whatever.
---
 or do these exist and i just haven't found them yet?
---
Lol.  How much have you saved for retirement? Your first house? I saved 70k for a down payment on my 300k house, and I didn‚Äôt do it buying garbage.
---
New players pay for the items you listed, not microtransactions. You know, like the Witcher, which is now getting its own show.
---
A heavy gun (50 cal, LMG, Gatling) is better for the SBQ, but either way, bloodied is by far the better option, I use a BE RW Handmade most of the time, and switch to BFFR LMG for SBQ &amp; Imposter battles only, The LMG can solo the SBQ but the ammo consumption makes it unsuitable for routine use.
---
This is exactly the same relationship ore refining already has.  You craft a misc item into junk.  You can't break it back down to ore (misc).
---
Same idea for gunpowder.
---
Whereas I still have something like 5k atoms languishing on my account that I am not spending.
---
1800 for a power armour skin is not worth it to me.
---
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
...Oh, you‚Äôre serious.
---
Godmode, yo.
---
i agree! way too annoying.
---
I just move the stuff on one wall piece to another and move it back.  Actually improved my weapons displays by "forcing" me to move everything around.  Now they're on an interior wall and I replaced the plain exterior walls with ones with windows.  I mean it's not like you have a bunch of stuff on EVERY section of your walls.  Just move it.  It's like IRL dusting, folks.
---
Oh great. Thanks. I didn't know that.
---
at L37, you should b thinking about what you want your specialization to be, as this will dictate the best perks, mutations, and armor to acquire.
---
You will not be able to move perk points between categories until level 50, and then its only one at a time, so its time to start choosing wisely
---
I like healing factor.   Most people also have marsupial.  After that, the 'best' mutations depend on your specialization.  
---
You don't need to equip hard bargain unless you are actively trading.  Those points are better used on another card.  Same logic for contractor and gunsmith.
---
==
---
So... Start with weapons.  What is your preferred weapon/playstyle?  Melee (hand to hand), rifle, shotgun, pistol, heavy (machine guns, miniguns, et al), or energy weapon?
---
Second, do you prefer strong defense/high health/tanky, or lower defense/higher damage when your character is very low in health
---
also true, wacky.
---
Dear Bethesda, please do something so people are not literally buying fallout 1st for a low res model of a helmet that should not even exist lore wise.
---
Anything.  Ill take anything.
---
I did notice that last night also. I was just hoping to keep a generator handy so I didn't have to repair the power plants over and over.
---
One of the players in my regular group adds them to our group page every week, so I was able to compare, and see that they had changed, I dropped from all 3 Silos last night, shortly after the reset.
---
You say that but most of the time even when ambushed they took out most of their attackers. In fact one of them had to be put down by the conspirator or she would of killed the whole ambush.
---
No, I sneak clear westtek with an explosive rifle several times a day.
---
I can stand next to a mutie, and shoot his friend and he doesnt notice me.
---
At the moment aren't they chnaging them soon or havr they already done that?
---
I found a small dog house by Vault 76 on my second character pretty recently, and inside the doghouse was a test tube rack and the periodic table written on the floor in chalk, as if done by a child. It was by the moonshiner‚Äôs shack, but my first time playing through I never paid much attention to the smaller structures. Details like this really blow my mind with just how much effort went into these things that many people probably take for granted.
---
Yeah, I missed out on much of the story my first play through. It wasn‚Äôt so much that I REALLY  wanted to complete quests. Though, that was part of it. I was mostly living in constant fear of being dropped from the server or the game crashing, and having to start whole sections over again. That‚Äôs a really cool detail you found :)
---
There is a spot on top of WestTec where perfectly preserved pie spawns.
---
Get like 10.  Put one for sale for 1-10k.  Proceed to buy everything.  Uuuhhh...well after that i don‚Äôt know, i started buying cheap serums and reselling them.  I bought nearly every plan i could find already, i quit because i really had nothing left to do.  I was selling pies for 7k easily a while ago, i guess people thought it was a steal or something.
---
what happened when you dropped the quest?
---
I had all my little heart desired from the data mined stuff once the fez dropped lol
---
It looks like you're going for a non-automatic rifle build. Is that what you want to continue?
---
What kind of rifles are you using?  Do you want a bloodied build? Or junkies? Or just a vanilla rifle build? Do you use vats? Do you prefer power armor or regular armor?
---
Those answers will help get a build fit better for you.
---
Fast travel bug

Still waiting for those black and yellow mosaic floors to come back :P Having that skin is pretty Veteran currently! :D

Nukacrypt should have them

New content, has been months othen the meetweek and halloween, but those were events. Its really bugging me.

One my biggest regrets with this game is not picking up that flooring when it was in the shop~don‚Äôt see it much around anymore

90% of camps have been in the forest. 8% in the savage divide, and 2% Toxic Valley..currently I have a secret bunker set up next to the space station for an Enclave-ish roleplay lol.

---
We went in the silo a few hours after reset last night and luckily just made it past the laser wire when we remembered reset was yesterday.  
---
I guess it wouldnt have mattered since it's just the date that's wrong. But we were up till 3am collecting code pieces only to have over 500 possible results üòÇ yeah I went to bed.
---
I'll have to start taking screenshots every week.
---
I appreciate the info. It's on later!
---
I think they should make it ammo and caps
---
Hmm, ore isn't something I'd though of, that does seem to fit.
---
Might be easy to do after all, that seems to take away the technical hurdle at least.
---
Heyyyyyyyyyyy.....yeaaaah
---
Free would be nice. Getting in through gameplay would be even better. Still, it's an online game and those need some kind of monetization to support itself. The investors demand constant flow of income, which is often provided through microtransactions.
---
So you a PM so that this isn't considered a trading post :)
---
Freezing when opening the map or pipboy.
---
Thank you, had a feeling they mightve been wrong since the date hadn't updated, just tried and they work, thanks again :)
---
It holds the BFG 9000 and the Sword of Truth.
---
Thanks, thought they were last weeks but date is incorrect still :)
---
If I‚Äôd know that before lol
---
So only for consoles?
---
Fast Travel bug.
---
Got a link to the show?
---
Lol non politically correct
---
Haha, agreed. I've been playing since open beta but I haven't leveled up much. I want these young whippersnappers to know I lived through the release of this game.
---
No, I took a break from late January until mid June, sometime in that period.
---
If you take Monaghan instead, it has an acid pit and nuclear pit to return the nuclear material spent on building the Fusion Generator. 
---
Outside that cost, all materials required to build the generator, two extractors and the medium gennys to power them come from site not your pocket (With Contrator 2)
---
You can enter the code pieces on Nukacrypt to help solve it quicker, but either way it's usually done in less than an hour from reset.
---
If want some help from 3 levels 20s we are willing to helpn
---
I don‚Äôt know to be honest, my first thing would be to go for like an assault type as I hate being slow, but I do usually have enemies really close to me so I‚Äôm not too sure.
---
Jetpack üòë
---
But those things are likely to cycle back in at some point. I don‚Äôt think any of the free items have but they could
---
These things will very likely be recycled through the years
---
Note to self don't ever try to complete 100% of the armor mods.
---
&gt; lore breaks
---
Atom shop items are not Canon. Regardless Ranger armor was just Riot Armor that was deployed by the LAPD. Charleston was also having riots before the bombs why wouldn't the Cops get Riot Gear? The armor in 76 even has the text saying CPD (Charleston Police Department).
---
The Armor was also deployed to the Military as seen in Lonesome Road and the Desert Variant from Honest Hearts ([Used by a Marine](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/R.B._Vickers)). There was currently War games being conducted in Appalachia so there is a reason for the Elite and Advanced version being in the area as well. Desert variants (not released yet) doesn't make sense but then again - The Atom Shop isn't Canon.
---
Took a while to sign up for this and figure it out on mobile but here is the proof. And in game I figure in either head wear or helmet is where vault boy uncle Sam should be.

the scrap stash will only break down junk items.
---
You cannot scrap weapons or armor at a tent, you will need a real workbench for that.  But your junk items can be broken down and stored just fine.
---
You can also cook there.
---
Tent = scrap and store junk only, cook, sleep, play the banjo.    That is it.  Its not a full camp.
---
I‚Äôve only done solo SBQ a couple times as a personal goal.  I still can‚Äôt get a solo Project Paradise with all three animals alive at the end.  I think that one requires an extremely lucky situation where they all wander close to each other.  I‚Äôve had two in the same biome a few times, but never all three.
---
SBQ is definitely not lucrative for legendaries unless you have 4-5 bloody players on hand to make a triple launch very casual.  I typically get my 150 scrip with horde events, Leader of the Pack, AWOL, Uranium Fever and a couple loops through the standard farm spots and fissure sites.  Leader of the Pack will pop up constantly if you also kill the accompanying wolf horde boss.
---
Except they release the ability to just purchase tricentennial items after the fact- so anyone could have them :)
---
I like the mire and the flora but its so creepy I stay away. Currently my favorite place is the relative peaceful location to the west of Seneca Rock next to the train trestle. The next place is the forest areas but not many flat areas I prefer.
---
Personally love team deathmatch but hurt when it turned out the hints mentioning deathmatch when game was release never came to fruition, instead of we get a knockoff of battle royale that every other game has nowadays.
---
That only works when the Queen doesnt drop her scorched horde on the top of the tent with you.     It happens.
---
&gt; Fix it Good and Weapon Artisan arnt used much by people at endgame, which is why I didnt mention as must haves. The repair kits garnered from the queen fight take care of repairs.
---
Not everyone participates in queen fights frequently, though. And other crafting and QoL perks like scrapper and green thumb are hardly essential, either, or at least not for everyone (it is build specific whether one needs more of the resources they provide). Technically, even gunsmith and/or armorer can be skipped by some, they might be on a team where someone else already has the perks, or not rely much on guns or modding regular armor.
---
&gt; Blocker is build specific, and a waste of points IMO.
---
It reduces incoming melee damage regardless of build, despite the name of the perk, you do not need to "block" with a melee weapon to get the benefits. Some may consider it a waste of points, they should not complain though if they get killed by enemies with powerful melee attacks. In any case, it is a situational damage reduction just like fireproof.
---
In the end, everything is "build specific", because only a finite number of perk points can be used at once, so there is a trade-off. People who do not rely much on mutations (or only use mutations with minor negative effects) can live without class freak. Similarly, tenderizer gives only a few percents of extra damage, but it needs an additional point of charisma, and many may find adrenaline more useful. Very few things are *really* must have for everyone.
---
I rarely use vats and I usually am using a handmade at the minute or an automatic assault rifle so I‚Äôm not too sure. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what bloodied is but I know I don‚Äôt want to be a junkie build I kind of just want to go with whatever is best I can usually get used to any style pretty quick in games
---
Yeah I usually notice they're up quick which was why it was so weird that they weren't up some 6 hours later. 
---
We Tried decrypting 2 different silos. Still had over 500 results on nukacrypt.
---
Same can be said about the Advanced Riot Gear helmet, including a filter on the helmet.
---
Dude they (Bethesda and their community Management team) cannot even engage the community in a meaningful manner. They have the worst community presence of any major online game I have ever played.
---
Its ok , but you really dob‚Äôt have to be mean , you could‚Äôve just said its not worth it, but chill I ain‚Äôt offended .
---
You don‚Äôt like free wallpaper?

My guess as well. Have to keep purchasing it over and over it you want different ones.

After you do it a couple times, it‚Äôs ez work. I can power up monogah in the first 8 minutes of my 4-6 hr session and go back every 25-30 min for free cores. Def work the investment to learn how to power up the plants if you are a PA/gat laser user.
---
That would be neat.
---
Along with this steel just pick up every damn weapon you can find and either spend the caps to relocate camp or there will be a train station and or a location with a workbenches on site easiest way to farm steel and plastic in the later game
---
Hard crashing when fast traveling from nuke silo after launch. Happened 3 times in 2 days, not too bad if your grouped, but if solo the servers gone and I've wasted a key card. I tend to write some players names down now so I can get back in but sometimes it can show them all as offline.
---
True enough.  Since you replied directly to my post I felt obligated to explain  my position on my choice of must haves.
---
You raise some really good points.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox too, didn‚Äôt play for long as my mate that started with me dropped the game pretty quick and I like playing with someone so I haven‚Äôt touched it must since but if your interested send me a message!
---
It would be nice if they are somehow in Wastelanders as an unlockable.
---
True brother , but its the ranger outfit and I LOVE IT
---
Amen
---
QQ
---
Most likely your issue  then.
---
A while back I was helping the warden reclaim control of the prison and discovered a skeleton in a bathtub that was clutching a toaster in one arm and holding a fork with the opposite hand.  That was moving enough,  but on the floor next to the tub was a line of children's blocks that spelled out "PWEASE".  I can only assume this poor soul was begging for release, but was missing an "L".  üò¢
---
Just last week, I came across a couple of skeletons wearing wedding clothes sitting in a lawn chair on the roof of a mansion.  She was sitting on his lap and they clearly died in each other's arms.  Sitting next to them was a small table with a teddy bear, some candles,  and another set of children's blocks, this time spelling out "HUBBA HUBBA".  üò≠
---
These scenes turned out to be infinitely more more effective in evoking emotion to me that any holotape or note I have ever come across in the game.
---
...I should really do some side quests.
---
massive cache of weapons, food, water?
---
But the problem is my game struggles almost everywhere.
---
If you‚Äôre as insane as you seem to be, I can make sturdy and heavy raider chests on PS4 if you want to farm out production.
---
What was the position of the person in contact with you? If it was customer service telling you they're getting the right team working on it, then maybe they were speaking for themselves that the person in contact with you can't do anything about it but the team they're escalating the issue to can? 
---
What else fid they tell you was being done about it?
---
Everything added to the game is canon. It becomes canon. This notion that the Atomic shop isn't canon is nonsense. It is absolutely part of the game.
---
I have the same issue with Zak and the dross toss event.. made grinding mr fuzzy pretty frustrating, but I could still do the other two! That sucks so much you can‚Äôt do any they are just stuck in that state üôÅ
---
That mosaic tile flooring....literally pisses me off i didnt have the game yet... i was a week late :(
---
A bloodied build plays with a small amount (usually less than 20%) of their health bar. I like my full health bar that's why I'm a junkie build. They are the 2 most popular I'd say.  
---
Or you can do a vanilla rifleman. You wont have near as much damage but we can still make your build around it. It's also much cheaper and easier to find different rifles for ghouls, robots, mutants, than it is to find a junkies or bloodied rifle. It just depends on what you want and how you want to play.
---
The hole in the map that‚Äôs been in the whitesprings resort since release tells us Bethesda is bad at using their engine.
---
No problemo. That'll be 500 Atoms ;)
---
Just in case someone reads this and doesn't have any idea WTF OP is talking about, if there are a lot of player 'dots' on the map where another map icon is (whether it be a player base, or an event, or even a regular fast travel location), clicking will almost always bring up a person's information instead of what you're trying to travel to.  It's almost as if selection preference is set to players over locations.
---
And yes, it's very annoying, though in my experience doesn't happen a whole lot.  But it's certainly annoying when you're trying to travel to a popular event.
---
Create a blue print of the items for the site.
---
Well you're only saving about a dollar and 40 cents so idk man.
---
I use spamming Bobby pin boxes as a Gage of server lag. If I can get two or less pickups the server is good. Anything greater than six I jump servers.
---
You‚Äôre right, even in the animation you can see your character fill it with powder (the flask looking think they put up to the barrel)
---
My favorite is at the sons of dane compound, P U in blocks over the nasty old toilet. Always cracks me up
---
Food lasts longer on my character with good with salt than in frig. Having said that the chrome one does look good in my bar..
---
They only modified them for low-level players, switching Atoms for in-game resources.
---
What are you paying?  My voice, much like my 1st subscription, comes with a price.
---
Why would they need gold? I think gold is simbolic... the large amout of concrete may be related to radiation? maybe?
---
Legendary drills probebly from the pre war construction crew. Or tonnes of concrete because they never fully finished it
---
People can't hear themselves when they speak
---
I agree with you, i also bought the tricentenial edition and you can still buy just that dlc...so what's the point.
---
They should have some sort of limited,  year 1, reward for us that have played since nov of last year ....even though i hope they sell the mosaic tile again, because i  missed it by a few days on account of me waiting until the game came out, instead of pre ordering :(
---
Tldr: Bethesda re-release the fucking mosaic tile. üòâ
---
They need the concrete to shield the world from the power of the BFG 9000 and Sword of 1000 Truths.
---
Paying? Nothing. Very few podcasts actually generate revenue of any kind.
---
they really need some items like - owned game for a year - owned game for 2 years - kind of items in challenges so you can show off the things you have done
---
Nope :(
---
Incase you haven‚Äôt heard, it holds the so called ‚Äútreasure of Appalachia‚Äù that is part of the main quest.
---
I guess I would be a vet because I started playing 76 December last year
---
The stash limit is case in point. They ‚Äòworked hard‚Äô to raise that limit. And it simply has to be some limit - appeal to dev knowledge blah blah. But now stash storage can be unlimited for crafting  mats with premium sub just like, oh, ESO‚Äôs premium sub.
---
\+250 DRWR (i know it's coming, but not soon enough)
---
It took me two months to realize that. Lol
---
I fully respect your rights to bitch about bugs, or P2W or atom shop or whatever else you don't like: during the appropriate topic, and this is not it. This is talking about things we enjoy, sharing what we've seen that we want others to enjoy. Don't be a Salty Suzie.
---
insane? oh well, it's just one more of the typical FO76 end game activities‚Ä¶ :-)
---
some repeat the queen quest hundreds of times...
---
some server-hoop Fort Defiance thousands of times...
---
some spend hundreds of hours with the camp...
---
btw, thanks, but I am in PC. Anyway I will go for the damn raider plan one day, unless I find one for sale (rare)‚Ä¶
---
 Fast travel bug  or heavy spin up bug
---
I think it's a trade off, limited by the old engine.
---
The world has a gazillion of objects and small detail compared to other games, but the texture resolution is quite low.
---
Lightning is also inconsistant.
---
In day time when it's cloudy the game looks like Half Life 1.
---
When the sun is out, the improved godrays from F4 really makes it pretty.
---
Same with foggy days, looks better than any other game IMO.
---
I just upgraded my GTX 1070 to a RTX 2080Ti.
---
At 1080p the game can still dip to 50fps at certain times.
---
I don't get the annoying stutters i used to get, though, and I can go from high to ultra and Max draw distance without a performance drop.
---
Functionally, it's next to worthless. I didn't really think about it when I got it because I just had around 4,500 atoms and nothing to spend it on.
---
It completes my camp's kitchen but that's about it. Only truly useful thing for me is that I throw my scorchbeast meats in there so I can make the mixed meats stew.
---
Private or public servers? On private servers i have run into level 5-10 super mutants at West Tek multiple times at level 130 something.
---
"If" Bethesda ever did this I think the best way would be either a small statue you could display or a piece of Wall Decor showing you're one of the OG 76'er. 
---
Side Note: Also salty about missing the mosaic tile floor. I've played since launch but never even saw it in the store so it must have been in there very briefly. Been waiting patiently ever since for it's return.
---
I'd also love the anti-tank gun from Battlefield 1, which you had to go prone to use, but don't know how you'd put that into the game in a way that wouldn't just be the Broadsider.
---
[You don't say...](https://i.gifer.com/Ebre.gif)
---
Correct answer. Had it twice, the robot usually gets stuck while entering the terminal.
---
Ironically, this used to be a bug in FO4 if you ran the game at more than 60fps :P
---
There's a ton out there to enjoy. Sometimes it's the quests, but more often than not I get more out of wandering aimlessly, that's when I discover fun little scenes and easter eggs
---
Dont fix it.  Griefing players is the only thing left to do in this game. Dont take away MY end game
---
The mire would be decent if they updated the levels for it. It should be an endgame zone for highly geared players, not a glorified forest for level 35s
---
What is the build limit for these?
---
I just saw your reply, LMAO.  Fucking Carson Wentz...smh
---
You should have the uncle sam 1776 outfit at the armor workbench.
---
I remember at E3 when Todd Howard was interviewed by IGN (could‚Äôve been a different outlet) he mentioned how he wanted to have the BETA be longer and be given free to all fallout 4 players. I‚Äôm hoping that comment he made leads to something like what you‚Äôre saying. As well this next thing wasn‚Äôt an in game reward for being one of the first players of 76, but if you played 76 prior to 2019 you got fallout 1&amp;2 for free, I‚Äôm not sure if the games had to be downloaded by a certain date to get them or if they‚Äôre added automatically to your Bethesda account
---
One of my turrets took a dislike to him the other day, so he started demolishing my camp. :(
---
As opposed to what?
---
No not really, I‚Äôm not a Dallas hater, I root for Dallas.......except when they play Philly
---
:)
---
And you forgot throw snowballs with batteries inside of them and Santa Claus
---
The ability to name frames was one of the things I put in my feedback from Beta. I had 3 frames by the end and was annoyed that I basically had to deploy them all to figure out which one to use.
---
Not trying to be mean at all
---
can confirm other replys. food does not last longer in the fridge ( to any great degree).
---
mine is up for grabs, only thing is, bring your own transport.
---
Yup i think i was the one who found that one actually:
---
https://youtu.be/nIXjTa4e-Gs
---
Ok I'd settle the AM rifle from NV and a AR-10 style semi auto .308
---
When I reject the quest it doesn‚Äôt do anything other than remove it from the pip boy but as soon as I load into another world it goes back to the same spot in the quest.
---
Its doable. I finished mine a couple of weeks ago. But it takes so many mats. Radium Rifle was the hardest, followed by Robot Arms (enameled).
---
Wat?
---
Weird.  I get and can complete them the days I play.  PC.  No probs
---
Oh no not the emote. I read about that debacle lol they weren‚Äôt even new emotes lol just different pics for them. I‚Äôm all for camp decor and outfits
---
The free states are definitely for the x01 at least. I haven't bought it though so I'm no help.
---
The best part, intentional or not, is that Armin Shimerman (who played his frenemy Quark in Deep Space Nine) was the voice of Andrew Ryan in BioShock, who is a similar Howard Hughes-inspired capitalist.
---
Yeaaaah Canned Heat.
---
It's one of those songs that sooooo many people recognize , but no one knows who sings it
---
Oh no not the emotes. I heard about that debacle and how they weren‚Äôt even new emotes just new pics for existing ones. I‚Äôm all for camp decor and outfits!
---
They‚Äôre already in the game as plans but they‚Äôre dev room items sadly atm. Not sure why Bethesda never made them available when they made X-01 available.
---
Spin up, 100 %
---
they already have your money, why would they want to do anything nice for you?  
---
they have gone from being a game company i looked up to into being one i despise
---
I'm disappointed in it. I was stocking roach meat for the ever upwards dailies to save running around every day. The meat spoils easily in the fridge.  With that being said the stainless version looks nice in a kitchen setup.
---
Oh yeah I knew that, probably could've worded my description better haha
---
I agree.  That is one of those cases where I feel the whole "Vaulting" strategy goes too far.  You see a neat floor in someone's CAMP, naturally you want to buy it, only to find "Oh, sorry, that was a special we had 3 months ago."  Well, that's a lost sale.
---
There are some basics that should always be in the store.
---
Can you link this spot? I've been looking for it for a while, I want to create an underground town. I don't like glitching but I like the idea of this natural hole in the world
---
Sneak

Covert op

Tank killer
---
Riflemen *3
---
Gunfu 
---
Gunsmith
---

---

---
Just to name a few...
---
Got a sniper stealth build myself. Let me know if you have questions.
---
I like having max health I just don‚Äôt like how I have to constantly be taking Chems to keep it don‚Äôt I
---
I mean honestly a weapon that functions like the BFG would be rad.  And we do need more/better one-handed weapons... hmmm.. I think you're onto something!
---
Thats all fine and dandy except fallout 1 and 2 dont play on my xbox.
---
No it‚Äôs inside the jewelry shop in the cell
---
hahaha! Cool! There's link on that?
---
This "garbage house" idea reminds me of that crazy north korean shows where reporters that look for people with "bad hairdcut" to harass. This kind of thing is evil.
---
Yeah, specifically I think it‚Äôs going to be a raid that rewards 5 stars
---
I don't plan to buy it because, aside from being inferior to the refrigerated backpack or Good with Salt, you have to physically *be* at your CAMP to use it.
---
Lady Janet's Ice Cream Shop and White Powder resort that I know of
---
I might even consider rejoining this sub.
---
Definitely helpful in a SBQ fight. I am instigating unarmed and swear by Blocker. Enemy mobs at group events tend to take damage before I can get in there with the first instigating punch!
---
See also: Fast traveling to Drop Site V9 during a SBQ battle.
---
With the Recon scope, you have to aim down the scope, get your cross-hairs on the target, and (sometimes) hold your breath. A diamond pip will appear above the enemy and will remain until you switch weapons or "holster" your weapon. This no longer works to highlight other players.
---
Love the mire. By far my favorite biome.
---
I've moved out a few times but I always go back.
---
there is a chance to get it from doing some of roses quest but only if you are a low level thats the most reliable source sadly üòÖ
---
Should be a vault boy statue like you get for lvling up in NW. If you played from week 1 you should get a vault boy running in a hamster wheel, and when you click on it your screen freezes and then goes blue for a sec.
---
East Kanawha Lookout tower. Super simple environmental storytelling. But it sends me deep down the depression lane. There are always tears.
---
The dates were wrong a couple weeks ago as well.
---
Line up the cross-hairs, then use the button to hold your breath/steady your aim. Sometimes you have to do the extra step of holding your breath.
---
Theres a few transcripts you can read about Vault 79 on the fandom wiki page. I'm not entirely sure if there even was an experiment in this vault, from the transcripts I read it has something to do with military steel shipments going "under the radar" to build this vault and it is heavily overseen by the U.S. government. Also something about a Chinese spy who ends up being a U.S. general and figuring out why she betrayed the government in lines of this project. Super weird, I hope it's a standard vault story but we'll see.
---
Ive been there from day one and i dont have any of that. Half the time the stuff was glitched and i never got it
---
... A likely story.
---
I completely agree. That's why I refuse to support the blantant disregard for the lore, and adding things in that wouldn't make any sense. Riot Gear as of Fallout: New Vegas was *specifically* an East Coast armour type. They're bringing into 76 is nothing but Nostalgia Bait and a disgusting excuse to bend the lore. Anything added is canon by logic as it's made by the company. I see New Vegas as canon and 76 as non-canon, but that's my own beliefs.
---
I know! I'm a big fan of the both of them. They have such distinct voices. It makes casting this role tough.
---
Oh, there's one in the cliffs at one of the entrances to the Whitesprings golf course. I can't remember which end though. Makes me hopeful there's other spots like this
---
Best bet is to swap servers and try to get level relevant spawns in that zone.
---
Damage rubberbanding.
---
They actually claim to have made a fix to this last patch.  I sure as hell haven't noticed a difference.
---
1. Fast travel
---
2. Jet pack
---
For rifles (with stealth, VATS, and criticals), I would use a SPECIAL like 3-15-3-4-4-15-12, give or take a point or two for each attribute. The important thing is that you want agility, perception, and luck the highest, and save as much as possible on the others. Although that does sacrifice a lot of quality of life, and especially carrying capacity. Also, automatic rifles (commando) are overall better if you want high DPS, and they use less AP in VATS.
---
The Mire was so scary to me when I first began playing &amp; I loved that it gave me that feeling. Its an awesome region with a good dark atmosphere at night but can be hauntingly beautiful during the day. I think my favorite Mire location is the waterfall people like to build their base around.
---
&gt;Obviously if you are in an event and don't kill a single thing, then you should get nothing. 
---
Oh come the fuck on, either you get the loot or you don't. You can't have your cake and eat it too.
---
Definitely! Expectation would be to recive increased health/thirst  bonuses for resting here for an hour or anti disease AND a pandora box to transfer items between alts üôèüèºüôèüèºüôèüèº
---
Shouldn't be an atom shop item. Should be rented with in game caps. Separate storage from your camp. Set to maybe around 400 lbs. Bed, purified water from sink that you can fill empty bottles with. Robot attendant with a food spawn.
---
Good one
---
I'll give it another try thank you for your help. I think I'm just retarded.
---
No. Atomic shop should not be used for that.
---
Yeah i agree, still kinda upset that tricentenial or Power Armour Edition owners get nothing to show for it either
---
I thought that they were accessible at one time if you were elected mayor or governor or something like that....You and people had to vote at the voting machines to get elected...I may be wrong but thought that was the deal.
---
Being able to place items underneath the prefab stairs with upper grating.
---
 I am happy to submit a voice clip. Good luck to everyone who has submitted! (Fingers crossed, never seen the show, but sounds fun).
---
Do you know if atom shop skins count towards the mod slots? I'm missing ONE mod on my leather armor and I've scrapped well over 1k in armor, and bought all the plans from vendors. Only thing I know I don't have is the vault Tek skins.
---
Reloading guns every spawn or server hop
---
Fake and gay
---
sure. Not as bad as people think, when you have First and a lot of hoarded mats.
---
Weapons are the next in my list. I just want to crack in advance my maps, to save some mats.
---
Radium Rifle is the weapon I have less mods to start too. Do you remeber how many Radium Rifles did you need to scrap to get all the mods?
---
Waiting for ammo to appear so can reload
---
You can get Game pass Ultimate, and EA Access for the price of 1st.. Let that sink in..
---
Yeah just being over level 300 Is enough to let everyone know you don't have a job
---
No like i actually placed it down. Like id be able to get in it.
---
Nah, I've been playing since launch &amp; that was never a thing. cool concept though.
---
Shouldnt it have recalled?
---
u/GhostmanRyan u/ChipotleBanana u/SirDouglasTheScholar 
---
As you can see guy, all of them had different models: [Complete set](https://imgur.com/a/lUDl9f5)
---
Ahh I loved that gun, rarely used it for killing tanks either lol
---
Honestly Bethesda will never get a cent from me for Fallout again. Back to Fallout 4 it is.
---
I call bs
---
I'd like a Beta fish in a fishbowl, for all us BETA players out there.
---
I dont have it myself but all the talk about it made me try out the good with salt perk and it seems to effectively render the fridge a moot point.
---
I didnt drop it i actually placed it by selecting it in my pip boy and placing it down. I wouldve been able to get in it. Shouldnt it have recalled when i logged out?
---
I often wonder why they make some stuff like this so incredibly difficult.
---
Honestly with how poor the hunting rifle performs they should just work on giving it the ability to collateral enemies if they line up.
---
I picked sturdy raider chest plans up somehow about 3 weeks ago.  It was either a TV daily or the Maddog Malone.  I know that ash heap events have absurdly low chance at metal plans perhaps same is true of TV.
---
Awesome! Looking forward to it.
---
yes, for what I've read so far, that is. 
---
So my plan will be to start a new character, to hurry up that quest and to pray loud to get it. If not, to delete the character and repeat.
---
I guess no one is going to sell the plan, when is unknown for him. 
---
And apparently these plans were not duped in mass in pc.
---
To a point...
---
There were a few exploits over the months that allowed people to reach insane levels.
---
Awesome!
---
But fezzes are cool...!
---
Thank you guys for the awesome info. I have a 2h build and this is great
---
Zooming in has alway made it easy for me
---
Dense?
---
I don't count dense plans, anyway, as they are not obtainable via scraping.
---
Basically rn its fasnacht masks or bust. The free atomic shop items are pretty much it, there should be a bracket of ‚Äòsurvivors of vault 76‚Äô items you can cash in for for every 200 hours of gameplay or something, since countless residents have perished since leaving the vault, thats all i try to hear when somebody bashes the game a bit too harsh i‚Äôm like ‚Äòoh that person died in game, rage quit, and swore iff the series its like they died in game lol‚Äô at least their character i mean..
---
There's no fundamental difference between 1 Steep Scrap and 10,000 though.  It's just an item type and a quantity.
---
Around 2000 Radiums. I burned through all the Mats I've been hoarding since February and had to buy more to finish. The last 3 mods were very difficult to unlock and the final Mod alone took 900 of those scraps.
---
They added that with patch 8 back in April
---
Yuck. I spent months hunting for my gear. I hate power creep. I would rather see weapon and armor effects along with perks rebalanced.
---
Or even just new items added to the legendary loot pool.
---
If so, I want to have the option to start a fresh character, without knowing everything.
---
Well you made me go and look. Sure enough, it has been in my stash for a while, it is a cow not a cat. Sorry Mr. Pebbles. 
---

Oh ok great, thank you for the info. But I think I‚Äôm gunna choose a different style, I‚Äôm trying to adapt my current stats to a specialisation. But thank you anyway.üôÇ
---
Where?
---
https://i.imgur.com/dkAguI7.jpg
---
Bloodied.  Everything else can be taken or left behind.    That‚Äôs how fucked up the mechanics are.
---
Yea crafting plans are the biggest we need this or at least a real respec option
---
I pre-ordered, received my copy two days after release and still missed the tile so don't feel bad xD
---
I'm on xbox and my dailies have been running fine.
---
My point is that they reserved this for a premium sub without telling us that was their plan. This is about poor communication and poor setting of expectations.
---
I'm still waiting for them to have a graphical representation of what a "plan" will create.  It would be nice to know if that whatever it is, will look good in my fort.  I could and have, looked an item up, but when I'm playing I dont want to alt-tab out mess up the graphics etc just for something like that.
---
There is a big advantage to taxing the seller rather than the buyer. Taxing the seller acts as a buffer to prevent the seller from going over the 30,000 cap limit.
---
Two example scenarios:
---
* Example 1/Taxing the Buyer) The seller starts with 0 caps and sells dozens of high-quality legendary weapons and armors. The seller steps away to grab some food, and a group of 3 buyers purchase 40,000 caps worth of the seller's product. The buyers are taxed an additional 10% and spend a total of 44,000 caps. The seller reaches the cap limit of 30,000 caps and loses 14,000 caps. **Total loss to the seller: 14,000 caps.**
---
* Example 2/Taxing the Seller) The seller starts with 0 caps and sells dozens of high-quality legendary weapons and armors. The seller steps away to grab some food, and a group of 3 buyers purchase 40,000 caps worth of the seller's product. The seller is taxed 10% and 4,000 caps are removed from the sale, leaving 36,000 caps. The seller reaches the cap limit of 30,000 and loses 6,000 caps. **Total loss to the seller: 10,000 caps.**
---
Of course, some sellers will have a price in mind and will increase their prices to offset the "tax," but that's a seller's choice. This is not a standard economy that requires traditional profit/loss/margin calculations like that.
---
Dense plans on chest are hard to come by and don‚Äôt appear to unlock from scrapping so maybe that‚Äôs it.  I‚Äôve found dense plans in watoga, Welch, Lewisberg and harpers ferry, but never on divide, forest, or TV vendors, not to say they aren‚Äôt there.
---
Supposedly can get dense plans from treasure maps.  I‚Äôve likely dug over 1000 maps and I‚Äôve yet to see one...
---
Isn‚Äôt CHAD the robot vendor at Camden Park?
---
Go ahead and pay for that second month though.   They love that shit.
---
Nawwww. But if you have extra plans, you can move them over to your other characters if you are clever enough
---
Yes, just like most every other game
---
Even something as dumb as an inverted vault 76 jumpsuit, gold with blue lettering
---
Just let us mass dupe again
---
And then a pop up that says "Just kidding!" And then it crashes for real.
---
I think many people aren‚Äôt/weren‚Äôt happy that it took a huge chunk of atoms or cash to get a floor tile at the time. With them reducing Santa prices many people I played with thought they would bring prices down. Also think we don‚Äôt see it as much because the people who did mostly quit. Not a soul is left from day one on my buddy list.its become more of a memorial.
---
Thank god.   It‚Äôd could‚Äôve been fake and straight.
---
Needs pc player with some for sale.
---
Yeah I really enjoyed the first 20 hours or so, then it started to get stale, then once I got to endgame it was unbearable
---
Was he that redneck neck beard guy crooning,  ‚Äúheeeeyyyyy booyyss‚Äù every five seconds?  
---
Guys everywhere.

That was a more comprehensive answer than I can find anywhere. So I'm going to go with it. Thank you for your time.

I‚Äôve never ever seen more than 12 ever, son, so smoke moar crack.

Yeah, considering that the T-series was used by the military and the X-01 wasn't, you'd think it would actually be the other way around.
---
It‚Äôs not like the half dozen spawns aren‚Äôt static...just fucking write them down.
---
Yes sir.   Three times the one star drops for you!
---
More options can be made by lifting some build mode limitations. You know setting up those conduits just takes too long.
---
Freezing on consumables. Complete unresponsive freezing that you have to manually close the game to escape.. Some days it's not an issue..others it locks up 5 times in a row on me and I have to take a break from playing.
---
Thanx,yeh i did and think i also join allready.il try to play around with it.il @ u.my gt is:soprano 307.on discord its:slick,so i have to change it to my gt if i read the rules right.cheers!
---
I got some decent stuff.  BE LMG, TS AP combat shotgun, being the two best, but still searching for my first Legendary Fixer.
---
We will stay posted for a 6 month update. The game officially killed me off after running into my 3rd ‚Äúcamp budget exceeded‚Äù bug for a base I spent way too much time on to just move on. In the year I‚Äôve spent playing this game, Bethesda has chosen to address more prevalent, yet smaller issues that plague this game, leaving the bigger, game-breaking issues to ruin the game for veteran players.
---
Beautiful weapon homie. I‚Äôll get my fixer eventually but I‚Äôm still on the hunt for a handmade.
---
Happy Holidays!
---
I think I'll pass, then.
---
This gets my vote! I'm like a cold fish with this bug... friendly people waving at me while I just stand there, staring.
---
Maybe VaultTech decided to try their hand at alchemy, and turned the vault dwellers into gold.
---
This is why I quit. I've played since the first day of beta. There was nothing to show it.
---
When fallout 1st came out and I learnt that 12 bucks could get me more than a year of play could I left.
---
Yeah, as time has gone on and opinions have moderated, I think it's clear that the fridge is a lot like the Collectron that was released at the same time.  It has some marginal functionality because you'd expect it to do something, but it's not anything that's game changing.  If you buy it, you should buy it for looks rather than function.
---
That is never going to work in a multiplayer game with so many players and so few bungalows. Even camps collide many times. What happens if two players on a server purchased the same bungalow?
---
Will drop you a message in discord
---
Bethesda, please make the lamp function on the Ranger Helmets! The Pipboy light is crap!
---
Sounds like the cryolator I just got from mwwrrggghhhhhly.
---
"For another 800 atoms you may obtain these!" lol
---
Youre just now getting disappointed?
---
meh, 500 legendary weps and armors sitting in the mule go to waste? some people might quit this game if that happens, including myself.
---
If you like the aesthetics then buy it.  Not a game changer at camp.
---
When joining a server, the enemies scale to your last logins' level.
---
If you launch the game, select your level 500, and join a server, it will say you are level 0 on the load screen. It calculates enemy levels before getting your level. This is why they are lowest level.
---
If you quit to main menu and find a new server, it will load you at your proper level and calculate the mobs like normal.
---
If you quit to main menu and load up your level 10 in the same spot, it will calculate the mobs off your previous character's level.
---
Oh they are duped 100% but so are a solid 50% or more of what ever you buy on the market place. And heck yeah they're op that's why I use em haha
---
I never get any lag in the Queen unless I use the split plasma with my strangler set
---
And I have plenty of other great weapons, bffr 50, Bffr lmg, Bffr gat, qe harpoon just to name a few. I just love being a god like that haha
---
Sounds like it'd be a fun event.
---
This.  I can barely put anything in it, and then I tend to forget about it.
---
Fallout 1st is what I use. I am leveling my first Heavy Guns guy and my two high levels are making stuff for him. This works very well.
---
 The small persistence the 1st world has is enough to transfer whatever you want from one char to another.
---
Cool. 
---
Not sure what GF has in mind for tonight and tomorrow, so cannot say with certainty if I'll be on either day.  
---
I can, however, guarantee I'll be on between midnight and 1a (EST) Friday, for an extended play session.  (meantime, I'll send you a friend request....I'm aj ninetyeight)
---
Since I cant FT, I think it's about a 15 minute walk from where I am to mcclintock, so you'll have time :)
---
   The specific serums/qty I would like to acquire are (at least) 2x speed demon, 1x healing factor, 1x adrenal reaction.  At 266 caps per, no haggling, guaranteed sale.
---
For Marine I needed 425... One Butressed was the last one to show.
---
I got an Anti-Armor 40% power attack baseball bat that‚Äôs perfect for my 2h melee build.
---
Preaching to the choir friend.
---
One of the main reasons I want the build restrictions like "part of the structure would be inaccessible" removed though is that they aren't stopping the crap from being built - and they are a major hindrance to building realistically in some areas.
---
I think Bethesda's push to put free items in the Atomic Shop is relatively new, so these free items may not have had a chance to circulate back into the Atomic Shop.
---
If I recall correctly, the only way to get free items in the past was through quests, NW rewards, etc. Now, Bethesda gives out free items without having to do anything other than log in.
---
Have mine on an unmarked boat in the forest since i just restarted , my old one was on a cliff near the devils backbone overlooking the bog
---
Not a bad idea at all. Do the same with our beloved Graftons mayor. Put him in a protectron in a sleazy suit.
---
On a server your past weekend that was giving me abysmal drops I got a bloodied limb damage two star fixer on about my 7th roll. I was about to stop trying on that server and then said fuck it and decided to just roll the rest of my scrip. Glad I did. It's not the best one but it's still good.
---
It's been released at least twice already. If I could build it for you, I would. For now, just wait maybe 2-4 more months for it to cycle back in.
---
There‚Äôs been free items for quite a while- they just weren‚Äôt a regular weekly thing before. Such as the nixie clock we got in the past etc. they were much more scattered before
---
Is that the one with the blocks spelling "My Angel"?
---
Yes
---
It has never been released again. I've played every day since about November 20th of last year
---
Pissing Contest failed: I don't care how much money you have. Although it does seem strange that you value $15 so highly. Like I said, running a game long term requires people to be paid to maintain and upgrade the game. It'll need to be supported for years, and the game itself is about $10 right now. New players buying for that price should get the entire game, all future updates and private servers for free, when other online games charge similar prices for their servers? That's not economically sound in the long term.
---
This actually is a pretty good idea. It would be cool if you could earn badges or patches or some other clothing item to indicate things you've done in your journey.
---
I agree with buffing legendary effects no one wants until they are more useful. This will help.
---
That tower's story makes me so sad.  I didn't want to put too many details for fear of spoiling people who haven't been there, but goddamn, I always get depressed there.
---
Not compared to fo4 it's not
---
Increased C.A.M.P budget packs available in the Atom Store...
---
Limited Time Special!
---
1500 Atoms.
---
I can understand your point of view on this. I would rather have more new character slots. I enjoy making many different builds and is way easier that grinding exp to respec build in the current system.
---
yea make new players the scorched
---
That and when they go back to your stored items its as one of that type, so not only do you have to replace them you have scroll through the list of posters etc to find the one you had
---
Could you confirm something for me? Does the second projectile gain the 100% accuracy bonus for a critical hit? How many subsequent shots gain the accuracy bonus when you go full auto?
---
I have a TS FFR plasma pistol. The first three automatic critical rounds fired land 100% of the time. With TS, each shot has a second projectile, so I am landing 6 shots with perfect accuracy every critical hit. I only ask because I have been told this behavior is not typical for hitscan weapons like your fixer. Plasma seems to be a very fast projectile, so I am thinking maybe it is special. Any anecdotal observations would be appreciated.
---
I like the Mire, because it's eerie and the higher level events are nearby my camp, but when the sun goes down in that region, it's almost too dark lol.
---
I also like the Toxic Valley, but I need more reasons to venture out there being almost level 300.
---
Yup, that's exactly what I want. What sparked the thread was seeing another player with it the other day.
---
This is all I use it for
---
Been here since day 1. Just spent the first few months not caring about anything besides shooting and leveling up. Regret never bothering to collect things ‚ÄúI would never use or need‚Äù
---
While the game is rated M, adding in actual gambling (or even any sort of gambling mechanics) starts causing all sorts of weird issues especially when the game is multiplayer.  Even Red Dead Online changes it a bit.  I'd be fine if they added it in, but they have to weigh the issues they may have in different states or countries by adding in a feature
---
Whenever I do the enclave event bots on parade, the bots always mention how bad it smells
---
Well me &amp; a teammate were talking about Gwent from The Witcher game &amp; then we started tslking about all the cool games in RDR (poker, blackjack, liars dice) &amp; I was like "76 needs mini games like this. Bet caps.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter to me when I‚Äôm looking to buy, but I always mod out the weapons that I put in my machines of stash space allows. Just something I like to do personally.
---
Mine have been working fine - actually messed me up a bit since in workshop defense they killed all the enemies before I got a hit in and I didn't earn any rewards.
---
&gt;No, don't worry about it. It's coming back.
---
Yeah, but will the players who wanted to buy it when they first saw it? üòã
---
I'm not on till later but if you ever do it again I'd like to try :)
---
Near as I can tell from the game data there is no guaranteed spawn point for Chickens.
---
Cat, Squirrel, Rabbit, Firefly, Fox, Opossum, Frog, and a ton of Beaver, but no Chicken
---
No problem, I can make as many as you need / want. I'm in California and am usually on at night
---
I wear the bos hood, plague doctor mask, and prisoner collar.
---
Trade glitch
---
Some days when I don't feel like doing much besides poking around, I'll hit an area and hit every spot possible looking for interesting stories and loot.   For example, Morgantown, I'll hit every porch, backyard look in every container, jump on buildings, try to find places I hadn't seen before etc.  The attention to detail is staggering if you really look into what was laid out for us to discover.
---
Oh im sure there'd be a lot of issues &amp; mechanics to workout for sure but I think it'd be a really fun concept.
---
If they are instanced it doesn't matter.
---
I might have to keep an eye on those vendors then, if you found them in the last couple weeks.
---
To be faaaaiiiiiiirrrrr...jk.. there is that Pioneer Scout paint for the Bowie Knife üòÇ..which we should've got a lot more with that quest line.
---
Honestly the forest probably just smells like a forest for the most part, the ash heap probably smells like a mix of burning plastic/wood, the toxic valley just smells like chemicals, I think the savage divide would smells relatively fresh seeing as how it's so high, the mire would smell like a lake, and the cranberry bod would just smell like bat shit
---
Thank you
---
That is the real struggle
---
You can view [Bethesda's Instructions](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/43883/~/where-are-my-fallout-76-tricentennial-bonus-items-%3F) for using the Tricentennial Upgrade Pack, but the key phrase is below. Sometimes you have to manually "buy" or activate the skins, clothes, etc in the Atomic Shop before you can access them on your characters in-game. If this doesn't solve it for you, you aren't alone. I've seen 3 or 4 other Xbox users posting the same problem recently. I'd recommend contacting Bethesda Support if this doesn't fix it for you:
---
&gt;In order to gain access to the bonus content, **you have to unlock the items in the Atom shop first**. If you have redeemed your Tricentennial Edition code, you will be able to redeem the items for free.
---
OP what‚Äôs your gamer tag?
---
My understanding of the camp limit is more just for server stability - ever item has it's X, Y, and Z coordinate it has to store, along with other information - so I imagine it's to help speed up the loading of CAMPS when players visit them.  So there could be a reason behind  it (Since otherwise it's an additional 20 items the camp has to track)
---
At least they did reduce the camp cost of the turrets, they used to be much worse....
---
I agree on the wallpaper on the inside, I have found some tricks that kind of work (using things like ramps and half walls to get a new larger wall there) but then you are actually dealing with two walls.
---
Also I don't think ghouls would smell that mad their flesh WAS rotting, they're done rotting till they die now
---
Well I'm mostly talking about the more populated areas in each region. Flatwoods, Harper's Ferry, The Whitespring...places with ghouls, dead bodies, rotting diseased scorched..stuff like that.
---
Rather than atom shop stuff people keep mentioning that was only available limited time (because realistically a lot of that stuff does and should be recycled and put up for sale again sometime) but just items that show you're a "veteran" of the game, i.e., they should have more collectibles you can find or get from having done certain quests or missions from far out locales.  Some of that exists, but I could think of tons.  A nuka-cola neon or lighted sign from visiting the nuka cola factory.  A sign or something from the generals steakhouse, etc.  Lots of stuff that kind of show you're a "world traveler" or at least just trekked across all of the map.
---
When it comes to armor, I prefer for them to be standard (at least for the DR/ER perk, like Polymer, Enameled, etc) because it makes it easier to tell if it's the light, sturdy, or heavy variant.  For weapons, I don't really have a preferences.
---
Oh I wish they'd bring caravan back (though it would be lore breaking) It's been a while but it was almost liked stacked blackjack in a way.
---
I didn't know Heisenberg had stolen Schr√∂dinger's cat.
---
Nope. Daily and weekly challenges are still functioning as normal. I just finished all of my daily and weeklies a few minutes ago.
---
I think you mean "Vault 96".
---
Didn't know that either.  Thanks!
---
The Whitespring would smell fine in the interior since they have robots, the towns would smell pretty bad
---
Even if they're done rotting I'd think that end smell would probably still be pretty bad and since they are still living creatures those sores and scars are still infected.
---
Pc. Well now I‚Äôm mad at myself because I was certain it came out before I had the game :(
---
Just wanted to point out, yes to put food items in the fridge - just as stated, you have to physically be there, but you can take stuff out of the fridge when visiting another CAMP from their stash box (if available- why do some vendors I hop to, not have a stash box nearby???)  Anyway to answer the OP- not really worth it, if you are in need of a nice aesthetic for your kitchen your making at your CAMP, then yes!
---
What perk card do I need for that?  ;)
---
Personally, I need something bigger to compensate for the bulky armor. Wearing the BOS hood along with Plague Doctor Mask would make me look like a vulture üòâ
---
Thank you for the correction.
---
If you're mainly after cores, most players sell them around 1 cap per percentage of charge or even less. I usually price mine at 75c for a 100% charge to get them to sell a little more quickly.
---
Hehe you got it.
---
I was expecting a ‚Äúpride and accomplishment of purchase‚Äù mention somewhere in there.
---
Sorted, I was there Monday night, needed a miners uniform for one of the Possum Badges.
---
Borderlands 3 did the same with the vendor if you miss picking it up. 
---
That's what I appreciates about them.
---
When the prestige system hits you can get special perk cards that can be transfered to new characters but for now your new toons are all on their own
---
Lol.  We all know that's not true.... 
---
   Keep on suggesting and hoping! üòÇ
---
if you're on pc i can apply it for you
---
If the wall has wallpaper on it already and you swap to another, stuff on the walls stays. I'm constantly changing them at my camp when new ones are released.
---
Yup ;) it's where I got all my mutations before everyone had serums, AHH good old days.
---
Great I‚Äôll add you right now. I know this is of topic but is it possible to craft mutations? it‚Äôs just they cost so much to buy and I‚Äôm trying to save my money to buy other things like the handmade.
---
I mean... I‚Äôm talking about heavy gunner being accessible at level 30. I‚Äôm level 30 but its not visible.
---
What are you talking about? You swap out cards depending on what the situation is, they don‚Äôt go away
---
Isn't it an atomic shop item? You can't hand it to someone or drop it if you painted it.
---
I'm at 35/45 and haven't scrapped more than a few hundred, that will be insane if these last ten mods require 1500+ more scrapped rifles lol üôÉ
---
Short answer, yes.
---
Can't bank perks like that I'm afraid.
---
We still don't have text chat, a trading post, perk card loadouts and a LFG tool, yet you want a free CAMP item?
---
Some perks are level locked, so you have to be a certain level to get them. You get access to all of them at 50.
---
Where the hell did you get pedophile from clearly you did pay attention to the quest
---
You have to spend the points to move up lvl as far as the system is concerned.  So if you didn‚Äôt pick the lvl 23 per point you got, you can‚Äôt use the lvl 24 point.  Best bet is to shoot for single point QOL cards if you have nothing to spend on since in theory those don‚Äôt drop from card packs anymore.
---
Damnit.  You mean I just suffered with 1 in every stat for the last week for nothing?  Pardon me while I curse.  A lot.
---
I figured they‚Äôd give me the power armor i paint it and give it back and try give me the caps
---
It was free for a short period of time in March. Ref: [https://twitter.com/Fallout/status/1103377230619660293](https://twitter.com/Fallout/status/1103377230619660293)
---
Nobody cares if there's criticism. It should be constructive though. 
---
I just started playing this game a few days ago and I absolutely love it. I also don't understand the mass hatred for Fallout First, given it's a type of MMO and all other MMOs (even ESO) has a premium subscription service of some sort. At this point it seems like most people just like bashing on Bethesda like they do EA. It gets old, and runs off the decent employees of those companies that would otherwise engage in meaningful dialogue with their communities.
---
The last 3 mods account for around half of all my scraps. Might have been bad RNG
---
It's okay to enjoy bad games, have fun! :)
---
Oh great I‚Äôll get levelling! Oh one more thing I just levelled up what perk should I get?
---
You can craft mutations, but the recipes are insanely expensive. I may have a few that I can give you. You should be able to find them in vendors for 300-400 caps each. I'll see what I have when I get online.
---
Rifleman.
---
I got about 4 of them last weekend when I did it it on PS4, so I'd say yes. But I've also done runs where I get no legendaries, so it's probably chance based, where other ones are guaranteed.
---
I can't afford many. I'm only level 32 and have about 900 caps.
---
Oh great, thank you.
---
Ah! All the yellow barrels aye? How you getting on bud?
---
Sent ya a PM.
---
Mine work fine except they like to shoot at each other fer some strange reason
---
No.
---
Yup, many hours spent server hopping and using the rad shower.
---
About half the time, my named power armor IS IN ALL CAPS
---
I have no idea why.  It's specific to the frame, apparently.
---
True, but that sort of gambling (since no money is involved) is looked at very differently than when you start adding things used in gambling into the game - such as cards or dice.
---
It's also between you and the AI, if they added some casino games, that would be player vs. player gambling, which opens up a whole bunch of different issues.
---
I use the scroll wheel, I would hope consoles have that option. Maybe you could message them all to move over a bit so you can ft, I can't do that ü§£
---
If any of y'all want a really nice community the Fallout 76 fans on twitter are really positive group. There's giveaways from different people, in game events put together etc. I'm at MissAtom_ on twitter if you want to check out! 
---
Everyone I follow pretty much is a fallout 76 community member :)
---
Thank you.
---
Yes, 50lbs increased carry weight per leg, combined total of 100lbs extra carry when both equipped.  You can also add them on the Excavator power armor and you get a real work horse set of power armor.
---
I thoughy tames dindnt count against budget anymore im pretty sure ive tamed a few at max and id argue that most dont have tames cuz they randomly die
---
haha just what i was thinking - well done
---
It's like a carnival game where everyone wins, but only those tiny toys on the third shelf.
---
I‚Äôve done a couple of runs and not had a legendary yet hoping to get some soon
---
At least you didn't buy the ~~nylon~~ canvas bag edition.
---
from what you have said to other posters...You don't like bloodied/low health or addicted, and were thinking a style other than rifle....
---
Given that - there a couple good Power Armor options.  T51 provides a huge amount of protection
---
Even in PA, you can specialize on energy weapons, heavy weapons, or melee, 1H or 2H, or a combination thereof.
---
Heavies and melee both require high strength, and both have weapons options to do lots of damage in a short amount of time.  
---
Amongst other features, PA can be modded to add Strength points. (motion assist servos), and carry weight (calibrated shocks).  PA also helps heavy weapons builds.
---
Because of high fire rate, energy weapons can do a a lot of damage in a very short amount of time (laser or plama gatlings come to mind, and work in or out of PA), and you don't have to get up close and personal.
---
Unarmed melee weapons like the death claw gauntlet, meathook, death tambo, and (sharp) knuckles can do very high damage per hit, but you must be out of PA to use them.  You'll need good armor when facing higher level enemies. (recall the Vanguard someone else mentioned?)
---
1H melee (knives, machetes, swords) are generally fast (lower damage numbers offset by speed of repeat hits) - they get the job done. 
---
2H melee (Axe, supersledge) do higher damage, but are slower, than 1H.  The slower speed may or may not be a problem in a mob.
---
For all melee weapons, using power attack greatly increases damage.  Both 1 and 2H melees can be used in or out of PA.
---
Heavy weapons for high level enemies or things that fly, and can be used in or out of PA.  Fast fire rate means high damage in a short amount of time.  But you need to make and carry the appropriate ammo.  Lots of it.
---
Vampire weapons come in all flavors, and will provide some health regen for each hit.
---
For heavy weapons, Stabilized3.  For additional damage to glowing enemies, glowsight.  Incisor for armor penetration, martial artist for swing speed.   Tank killer.
---
Bloody mess for bonus damage. 
---
Mutations for all builds: Marsupial, speed demon, healing factor, adrenal reaction.
---
Scaly skin mutation gives bonus melee damage, but has a gun accuracy penalty.  Might be mostly offset by classfreak3.
---
Grounded mutation lessens energy damage received, but also lowers energy damage delivered
---
My bloodied sniper does this, got tired of freezing while eating and drinking in the pipboy
---
Thank you, this is the exact answer I was looking for. I was a beta player last year and didn‚Äôt jump ship until I got to 110 and just got bored of the game so I am very patient with bugs but this one really pisses me off because it‚Äôs such an annoying waste of time.
---
Oh ok should I leave getting perks and such until later when I can change everything at once also should I leave my perks as they are for now.
---
Exactly! I've been here since beta, but I'm only level 70 because I have an intelligence of 1.
---
Well I guess that makes sense, same as those stories you hear of firemen starting fires so they can put them out
---
I never use it. My refrigerated backpack gives me 60% reduction of rot compared with 50% for the fridge. My other character has level 3 good with salt so 90% reduction of rot. When I have put food in it, it just ended up spoiling cuz I never got back in time to use it.
---
And the prototype radiation suit (same function different look)
---
Solid pass. Also how does it solve anything, you'd literally have the same problem in a month or two.
---
Sargents' holotape in Flatwoods. Guts me every time.
---
Server stability issues in general. But the fast travel bug is obnoxious, while I think I've found a workaround using enter key instead of clicks, it needs to be fixed for everyone lol
---
The higher level the armour is, the higher the damage resistance. You should try people vending machines for cheap legendary gear.
---
Depends on if you have good legendary effects on them, but if it‚Äôs just normal gear than normal gear at your current lvl is always better
---
Yea I'm good tnx m8, u ?
---
I like the mountains by Harpers Ferry cause there‚Äôs a non hostile, non feral dog up there. Nice little dude.
---
Have you ever put wallpaper on the outside of a house?
---
Well, I‚Äôm a console player. So any form of text be it in-game or over Xbox Live is little difference unless you have an integrated keyboard already.
---
But yes. Any form of in-game keepsake saying ‚Äúthank you for continuing to play our game‚Äù would be welcome. I do share the sentiment with many others on this thread alone that the only action-based-language we‚Äôve really witnessed from Bethesda has been hidden behind a paywall or the Atomic Shop exclusive which turns out to not be so exclusive a month or so later.
---
I think if anything, it would just be a small relief to have proof that some of the people who care about Fallout as a game series include the ones making it.
---
It is in disrepute because the lyrics are a bit rapey. Not as bad as "baby, I ran out of gas" but close.
---
If it was actually placed and you just didn't enter it, yes, it should automatically return to your inventory.
---
Could be a new bug, seems like with every series of updates/fixes, they create more things that bug out.
---
Yeah, that was the participation trophy they gave me.
---
Endless load loop if you die when an event is ending causing you to close app and lose all your junk. It really puts a damper on SBQ fights.
---
ü§£
---
I really don't bother much with turrets anyway, I just repair the camp damage, turrets just sit there as mole rats or scorch etc smash them to oblivion and the turrets do nothing. Useless build budget sink.
---
I would raise as you go. Leaving perks (especially before level 50) isnt a good idea as some perks dont unlock until you pick cards for the lower levels.  Work on raising your special to what it should be. Start with your perception. Get it to max. Raise those rifleman perks.
---
Good point, but yeah, don't want to risk it.
---
You were annoyed because of Black Friday? Happens with every game released around that time.
---
Oh really helpful I think I‚Äôm going to go off for a break and compare the pros and cons of the different specialisations you guys have said because the idea of shooting stuff is fun but I do like power armour.
---
Have you played the game since then? It has changed a lot. I waited until it hit $40 and I've got over 1800 hours so I'd say I got my monies worth out of it. There are still a lot of issues but if you find some good people to play with it can be a lot of fun. I was bored around level 120 because I didn't have many people to play with at the time. Now I've got 4 different characters and my main is level 423. The community makes the game.
---
Sorry I upset the few Bethesda employees who down vote anything negative, who cares I still play the game but will not give you any more of my real money.
---
Server hop in watoga, there are like 4 or 5 suit spawns there.
---
Level 40 will do more damage
---
Ok
---
I'm up for that, I'll send you a request
---
My camp is on the shores of the Ohio, north of Hillfolk Hotdog.  The crickets sometimes get very loud near the water.  But shooting a gun or making a loud noise makes them all stop.  Then they slowly start back up until they are all loud again.  It's a nice touch.
---
If I go to a shop and purchase something,m I am a customer. Once I walk out of the door I am now only a pedestrian.
---
Ok sounds good. The great thing about all of these people giving advice is even if I don‚Äôt use the advice for this character I will probably end up making more when this one is maxed anyway üôÇ
---
I do Monster Mash pretty regularly. Sometimes I get no Legendary Ghouls, sometimes I'll get a half dozen or more before the end. I've also had better luck getting 3 star drops from this and AWOL Armaments over the past couple weeks. 
---
Good luck to you!
---
I also have a rifleman.  I use a b/e lever to erase the first health regeneration while they‚Äôre in the air, between 1-3 shots depending on level and distance, then while they go through the short regen I switch to a fixer with the same effects and do a VATS chain with as many crits as I can spam.  Usually 6-7 shots with a crit or two will nosedive them.  Maybe 30 seconds from first shot to last, with a breather while they‚Äôre regenerating.
---
Yes, they‚Äôre rare guns but you don‚Äôt need BiS equipment to farm efficiently.  My new commando character has a b/vats accuracy combat rifle I got during the sale, and it performs just fine.
---
Out of curiosity, why not go bloody as a rifleman?  The agility boost from unyielding makes you nearly invisible and the damage is what you want for one shot kills.  It‚Äôs a pretty safe build to play.
---
I have 2 characters. One level 162 the other 125ish. It's much more fun to play once your build is how you want it.
---
Build more than one if you need more space.
---
What are you looking for, I have most of the recipies now.  I am on Xbox, if you have the materials I can craft it/them for you.
---
I bet.
---
You're a star, I had no idea this video existed, many thanks üòä
---
I haven‚Äôt seen a legendary in there in awhile. Nice
---
wrong post for me. I am sad
---
I only use it for cranberry foods too
---
I know that dog...poor little guy/gal
---
To create the illusion of rarity and make you feel like you've really got to spend money.
---
Thank you sir
---
Yeah, there's been free atom shop items, occasionally, for a long time now. But they don't seem to be exclusive, sometimes they come back with an atom price tag. I wasn't really into the atom shop early on, didn't buy Xmas stuff, I did get the new years tuxedos and I like my bunny mask hehe.
---
I like the collectron. It allows me to build my camp on some other resource than a junk node. I tend to forget to check it so when I do it's always loaded with scrap
---
My favorite was a molerats that would dig into the ground and appear across the opposite side of the junkyard, every time I got close to it.  Over and over and over. After about 15 mins a random low level player just happened to wander by and they killed it for me.
---
I go there and leave him/her fresh radstag or Brahmin meat sometimes. It‚Äôs my way of saying thanks for being the one thing on the entire map that doesn‚Äôt try to kill me.
---
They are everywhere. Look for a player vendor with lots of meds. I had to surf the game only a little bit, to scam up the serums 2 of my chars needed.
---
Well done. Would defend.
---
I thought a Vet was 10 years or better.
---
Hey, imagine that, I just found a camp with the same 4 masks.
---
You can also use a small letter a, then b, c....
---
I have two sets, the one I carry on me cleverly named "Excavator PA" and the one I almost never use in stash called "Ultracite PA".  I gave up on having more then two.
---
That's a pretty cool build, but there is a settlement that needs your help...
---
Lol same with the rad scorpions... so dumb. So much is broken on this game, still. I just got hit 3x in like 2 frames by a Yao guai and KO‚Äôd but it takes me like 10 frames to reload my pistol
---
Yes I seriously am still annoyed... and no it‚Äôs not because of Black Friday, the game was price gouged after the first week of release basically.  But no I haven‚Äôt played in the last year.
---
Makes me want to stop being a raider and join the Minutemen
---
Oh!  You're right - I was thinking Twisted Muscles, not scaly skin.
---
they're listed under Misc and not Meds
---
Yeah, swing speed is a must for any 2H melee weapon. It's often the difference between life and death, and bonus points if it has +1 strength in the third slot.
---
Your goal with 2H melee is to one-shot everything except scorchbeasts, the queen, yao guai, etc. Otherwise you will get swarmed and die a lot. If you're going bloodied, you'd probably be better off with unarmed because you're just too slow to kill everything before it hits you with 2H.
---
I run junkies 2H with mostly vanguards armor and an auto-stim and life saving piece and I can tank pretty much anything. I can't dish out as much as the bloodied players but with the right chems and food, I can do some pretty decent damage.
---
It actually was indeed because of Black Friday. You would notice two weeks later the price was back to full price. 
---
I also bought for full price at launch. 
---
Kind of weird to post this here when you haven‚Äôt played in a year. Are you just trolling? Why not just play the game? You paid for it.
---
Of course they compensated for this by making the plans far more expensive. On my first character I had to server hop for over an hour to ger handmade plans, but they were 6-800 caps. Now they‚Äôre something like 2000 caps. That‚Äôs absurd.
---
Yea I'm not fond of bloody myself...tried it wasn't for me, even have a AAE Bloody handmade....Plus I think bloody is the most popular build in the game so I build an Anti-Bloody build. I have a nice arsenal of executioner &amp; 2S radium &amp; Gamma guns to fight bloody builds..back when Survival was still a thing. I'm a vanguard build &amp; really like it. I might not pack the punch of a bloody build but I'm damn hard to kill. lol.
---
Yeah damn molerats at Gorges Junkyard too. Sometimes they spawn underground and nip at your heals, plus you can't target them. Fyi, if this ever happens I eventually found out throwing a Molotov works.
---
in one of the train yards there's a carriage which os leaning uo against a building and the door is open but you can't get in unless you put your power armour inside then step into it, inside is a bunch of objects watching a tv with beers and cigarettes
---
As a PS4 player, I do true everything, powerful automatic receiver, reflex sight (circle) and a suppressor. The auto aim for console makes it so I don‚Äôt need recoil attachments
---
Got 5 on a run last week. XB1
---
Shhhh.  Don't give them any more ideas.  They will add a few dollars to the sub price.
---
Fuck bethesda he is absolutely right. The game probably wouldn't have dropped in price regardless of the holiday had it not bombed in real life. 
---
Now I don't know what planet you guys live on where greed comes before customer service from a major company. For instance walmart returns almost anything no questions asked. They even have a number to call!!! Can you believe that. Off track... they have a fuck show of a buggy mess with something beautiful underneath. 
---
I dealt with the disappearing legendarys, I dealt with the power armor freeze, I dealt with the cannot place here camp building and shitty snaps, I've seen it all but when I put in one ticket to get a care package of lost scrap from the 1st box (yeah I bought an annual btw) I've also bought about 4 different people 1st subs for a month for them to try it out.... 
---
Just put in a ticket and you will be sadly declined anything and everything by some robot. Thumbs down me go for it idgaf. We are the problem buying their 18 dollar dlcs and plush toys they push out once a week, then they think oh well we can push that bug fix back with wastelanders... fuck that I'm over it. 
---
Btw the game should have released once wastelanders was finished and it might have been a different story. But they wanted to push this turd out like it's an assassins creed or cod game.
---
Fanboys have at me. Lmfao
---
I've seen players build their bases up there so they can have him/her as a pet. lol
---
No way, totally the wrong aesthetic
---
I've searched thru the atom store for anything saying redeem or activate and there doesn't seem to be anything. Looks like I'll have to contact the customer support...
---
I'm sorry man. You'll probably get more people when wastelanders gets closer to releasing. Especially considering private servers are now a thing.
---
I mean, I'd be miffed too if I bought a game at full price only to watch it crash next week, but that's also why you should never be lured into pre-ordering.
---
&gt; anything added is canon by logic as it's made by the company
---
Oh so [Skyrim and Portal are in the Same Universe](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fall_of_the_Space_Core,_Vol_1) then. "created by Valve and Bethesda" Has to be Canon. And if Portal is the the same Universe then Half-Life is part of Mundus. Half-Life Alyx is a Elder Scrolls Game!
---
&gt; New Vegas as canon and 76 as non-canon
---
You just contradicted yourself with the belief anything added to a game (even completely optional paid cosmetics) by the company is canon but a game made by the company isn't. So which is it?
---
&gt; specifically an East Coast armour type
---
So the Government develops armor but restricts its usage exclusively to the West Coast? How does that make any sense? Or was it more likely Obsidian didn't want exceed the scope of what they were allowed to add or change to the lore so they only mention the West Coast in their game.
---
That's right yeah! Is the suit always the same level or does it scale?
---
Yes. Would love a shared stash as well.
---
I did the same thing only with my level 339 heavy gun character helping my lvl 75 heavy gun character. I transferred weapons, armor, and mats through the suitcase at one of the train stations in a private server. It made the "level up road" much easier to travel. I still got to revisit all the quests and to hide from the scorch beast once again! :)
---
Very well my man! Just counting down the days till ~~Xmas~~ Star Wars comes out!
---
Nice one dude!
---
But it would be funny at least
---
Minted, i play on XB1 so hoping I get some on my next run!
---
lol yeah, there's no point in saving up perks until you hit level 50 and meet the level requirements for all perks.
---
No idea ive only seen it level 50 but i was well beyond that when i first discovered it.
---
That's pretty cool but you should come join the Free States...
---
No worries! Theres too many to keep straight!
---
Sent ya a PM to see if I might be a good fit for your grand plan.
---
Haha! I‚Äôm going to have to search for this one! That‚Äôs awesome!
---
You'll also want marsupial, speed demon, adrenal reaction and I personally like carnivore because I live on a diet of glowing meat steaks (10% melee bonus), fury (lots of good bonuses) and whiskey (str bonus).
---
Unconfirmed, but I do recall reading somewhere that 4 and 5 star legs would come with wastelanders dlc.
---
Also Mirelurks are fond of poison attacks, like the Hunter or the King.
---
or they could add 5 star weapons
---
Do distant thunder and you can make your own
---
I went through all the Tadpole and Possum challenges again to get the backpack on my second character. Not much fun. I finished the Possum eight challenges on my first character to get the high capacity weight mod for the 60 pound carry weight backpack. It raised the carry weight of the backpack to 120 pounds, which earlier, I didn't even know was a thing! Wow, does that make a difference!
---
Isn‚Äôt there like a super slim chance that you will even get it from doing that mission
---
5000 pounds. Maybe a bit more.  When the alternative is literal infinity the comparison needs to be something worth while to not be a total joke. 
---
The goal of course being, let the player play the damn game not inventory management. So a very big capacity is essential to that.
---
Ive gotten a few
---
Deal. Lol
---
This has happened to me once. It's a little bit scary but you get xp
---
Randomly. I think LA is the only T-60 piece I can make. 
---
If, you don‚Äôt manage to find one in the wild.
---
just use dog food
---
That would be very helpful.
---
My camp in Savage Divide and it's in the same place for about 11 months. ) But I really like exploring Toxic Valley. It's very similar to Fallout 1 and 2 world. I hope someday we get dlc with new state - mostly similar to Toxic Valley design, where live completely degraded NPC like Sulik )
---
Yea it would be a great QOL improvement
---
It's been a glitch for a while.  I mostly run into it in the Whitesprings
---
You can add me JefferyLewbowski
---
Moonwalking scrapbot. Every time I load into private server my scrapbot just floats along with 0 animation, until he docks then has fine.
---
Just happened to me yesterday by the pioneer scouts daily where you clean up. Exact same thing.
---
I‚Äôll take all that meat though!
---
Surprisingly nuke silos also have lots of lead
---
For sure. It just took me by surprise and I wondered if there were any weird occurrences like this happening because of Wastelanders coming. I was like ‚Äúwoah now! Hold up I‚Äôm not used to this!‚Äù
---
Ok cool.
---
Haha I thought the same thing! Wonder what is making them herd up like that all of a sudden?
---
As a Sims player, I love love love this idea. There are whole websites dedicated to the download of Sims creator content. The blueprint files are for the most part free to download, and any DLC used beyond the base game is included in the in the itemized detail of the blueprint. 
---
Some people are super talented at camp creation and straight up pay atoms or caps for some of the amazing camps I‚Äôve seen around the wasteland.
---
Thank you mate
---
Put it on the FB used group, those guys take anything I swear....
---
Hey just wondering do you think you‚Äôll be on tonight?
---
Well done establishing the Minutemen: Appalachian Chapter headquaters. Now about those settlements that need help\~
---
Those aren't just humanoids, those are my brothers...
---
Love your podcast. Keep it going!
---
How many times we gotta tell you, they do not care about you
---
I must visit that place. I still lose a lot, but practicing isn't so easy anymore
---
Honostly I cant remember lol do it without thinking, might be one of the sticks or triggers/bumpers
---
I always start my day by scripting and selling something. Then I do the dailies that have popped up and visit some locations to see if they have fun enemies. Then I go over to Camden Park to get my tokens for the day and then I check my personal terminal to arrange a visit with Biv and to help clean up some toxic waste.
---
Sniper
---
Agreed. It would take little dev effort (imo but maybe I‚Äôm underestimating) to add an glow/effect similar to the targeting HUD or a recon pip or something on dead legendaries.
---
Fo1st now only 21dollars a month. With the new and improved Buid-a-Plan workshop CAMP item. Do you want to ruin an entire games economy!? Then come make your plasma grenades nowwwwww!
---
Yea, there's lots to consider.  
---
Sometimes, your build may surprise you.  In previous FO's, I hated melee.  
---
 Because of my initial lack of understanding how 76 perks worked, and not knowing anything about   
---
 specialized builds, I chose perks that worked best with the weapon I was using at the time.
---
  That "strategy" ended up with melee as primary.  And I've found I rather like it.
---
  Secondary for a while was sniper, but after a point, sniper didn't work for flying things, so swapped out a couple of cards, and became a melee/heavy gunner.
---
In PA if I choose, unarmed if I don't.
---
Of course, you can also choose to be a generalist.  Pretty good at most anything, but not "expert" at anything.   Surely would make playing more challenging, though :)
---
&gt;It also seems to enhance the feeling of aloneness.
---
Now this is something I never gave thought to, I've always found other *real people* on the map contrary to being a lone wanderer in a world devoid of humans, except that guy and that guy.
---
I'm not a 1st subscriber but I might bite the bullet and give it a try.
---
It is comical after an encryptid event watching everyone search for the imposter sheepsquatch corpse and then notice that it is in different places for everyone much if the time.
---
I always said that acid cost of 3c per was not proportional to the amount of time it takes to farm it. In fact, acid was always the biggest pain. Lead, steel, flux - I can get all of that stuff without much problem by using 2 accounts and muling. Acid was always a pain though. Good thing I stocked up on 10K of it when it was cheap.
---
But do those existing assets have **16 tImEs ThE dEtAiL** yet?
---
Bromanoids?
---
Exactly!
---
I guess borderlands bombed this year also right? Because I picked up for $20 at Black Friday this year.
---
Or when a legendary robot explodes and it‚Äôs body flies  a mile away.
---
That must be true, although it seems many Fortnite players *kids* use a PC.
---
Cool, cheers. I'll grab myself another!
---
I see very few CAMPs in the Cranberry bog. The only reliable spot anyone puts up is at the substation just north of Watoga. I see more in the Ash Heap, esp the little shanty town with the cats.
---
Yeah I will. Probably in a few hours. Planning on launching some nukes.
---
Has happened to me at One Violent Night several times. I think the legendary baddies should be a little tougher.  That is, more durability.  Little more like SBQ.  Any legendary should be able to withstand  at least 60 seconds of damage from anybody. In other words, the darned thing should have a minimum "alive" time. Sixty seconds would give everyone enough time to get their licks in.
---
Much wider open too. Most people I fight in ammo dump hide inside of a room and spray the doorway with tesla or energy explosions.
---
What exactly are you complaining about? The fact that you don‚Äôt need to buy something the moment it is in the shop?
---
And you think you should be able to buy more camp budget in the atomic shop? That doesn‚Äôt sound at all p2w to you?
---
I can read the polygon headline already "player lures others to his private world to kill them at workshops in elaborate trap"
---
Stabilized barrel and grip, then a suppressor will help the most.  Frankly, I use true barrel and stock for hip fire accuracy and a suppressor. I find it much easier to control than a combat rifle - those things are crazy.  
---
Also, if you like the hip fire accuracy of a true barrel, you might try the ground pounder perk.  
---
For my purposes, the true, aligned and stabilized barrels and grips are the only ones that matter.  The rest are just filler making it harder to get the ones I want.  Just like receivers, hardened and powerful automatic are all I‚Äôve found a use for (except Prime, of course).
---
I'd just be happy with some shared space, not a ton, just enough to pass guns/ammo between characters without bugging my friends to mule it for me.
---
Too easily manipulated.
---
I actually can change my voice and am good at impersonations. This sounds really interesting, I might pull out my good mic and give it a shot.
---
does it def work bc ive been trying with the scorched beast but i have yet to get it to work
---
i have all those
---
I know not the same thing, but pre-orders of the Tricentennial Edition came with cosmetics. Not sure if those items became available to everyone else.
---
Whatever is causing my melee hits to not register
---
How about they keep putting out new items and stop recycling old ones? 
---
P2w what? The Cosmetics of an awesome big house? If you're worried about defenses being the winning bit you can always put a cap on defenses like they did on the number of lights. If you put more into the game you should get more out of it.
---
Oh I‚Äôll have a think. Thank you
---
Wish I could come :(
---
Did you track if you gained levels doing that?
---
.... you say that but you probably own a few things that should never have been in the atom shop. Things change.
---
Did last time i did monster mash.
---
Better yet, stick him in an Eyebot, since he likes to be loud and annoying and broadcast his voice across the Wasteland. Maybe even establish some lore that he was forced to upload himself into it after some angry 76 dwellers smashed his AI console.
---
A race for the precidency
---
This is a good point, and something I haven‚Äôt been taking into consideration. I‚Äôve been modding combat armor with deep pockets and BoS before sale. Maybe I‚Äôll just let them go without.
---
I think he means that "limited time" items are not in fact limited time. Other games retire their limited time items and never make them available for purchase after. It helps people who purchased them initially feel like they have a unique piece of the game.
---
I remember a post from a while ago that detailed how learning mods worked.  Basically each mod for an item has a % chance to learn it and they all roll independently of each other.  This means when you don't know any mods you still have a high chance of one of them rolling in your favor, but if you only have one left to learn, then you are at the mercy of a single role against the % chance of just that mod.  Also, I specifically remember the mods for the radium rifle being very low chance compared to almost all other weapon's mods.
---
depends.
---
If the lower level stuff gives better damage / protection than anything else you've found so far, keep using it
---
I used a L20 Vampire machete until L46, because it delivered more damage and better survivability than anything else I found.
---
At 46, I swapped that out for a plain L45 cultist dagger, and used that until L65.
---
At 65, I picked up a 1\* L50 vampire switchblade; it's been my primary weapon for almost 100 levels now.
---
At L156, even though I have all the max level PA types, I'm still in L45 Excavator most of the time.
---
Even if you cant get in the silo, you can still help kill the queen!
---
yeah, I know, and I can't wait, LMAO
---
My level 150+ character has a level 40 armor piece.  I give up a bit of protection for the legendary stats.  Otherwise, if your weapons and armor are non legendary you should have the highest tier available to your level.
---
That‚Äôs one of the locations of radstags for the hemlock holes quest.
---
If you've managed to get through all the garbage they have been shoveling and still got Fallout 1st, they will anticipate you just keep plodding on, wallet open.
---
Agree to disagree. I didn‚Äôt have enough atoms saved up last winter and am hoping now they bring them back.
---
Yup, dropped a three star legendary mirelurk hunter at the SBQ last night. Never found the body :-/
---
Yeah - I have the Nixie tube clock. Was just sitting around for months doing nothing and the other day I was powering some signs up and it was nearby and it sprung to life for the first time.
---
I‚Äôm a fan of the Cranberry Bog. It‚Äôs flatter than anywhere but White Springs and has plenty of water access. I suppose one could see the local ‚Äúbat problem‚Äù as a nuisance but I find they cook up well.
---
They should just put a small X on the player compass for a corpse you killed and for a Legendary make the X glow yellow.
---
Or you kill a 3* legendary scorchbeast and it just falls right through the ground. So frustrating
---
Yea it‚Äôs a pain. I hate dropping legendaries in the mire then walking around for 15 minutes looking for it in the dark.
---
That defeats the cosmetic purpose of the atomic shop. You shouldn‚Äôt be able to buy access to a larger base. Base building is such a big part of them game. I could not disagree with you more
---
I made this same mistake. You apparently need to spend what you have to get the better options. Wish I had known this when I started on that particular character.
---
Or even a marker on the map that says retrieve legendary loot
---
Yea... hard pass
---
They make them have that green aurora while alive, their corpse should do the same
---
Yea that‚Äôs never fun
---
Cut content
---
Workshop pvp is for wankers.
---
I want to buy it because of the discount...but then I also know there is a Nuka Cola version and don't think the 20% savings now are worth having to buy it twice when that one hits the store...my conundrum is saving 140 caps NOW or 560 caps THEN...
---
Oh, really I didn‚Äôt know there was a safe place at least I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs what it is. I‚Äôm trying to get the excavator power Armor chest because I got the rest as a gift but the enamours are too high level üòÇ
---
We‚Äôre rebuilding America and America doesn‚Äôt live in caves or hobo shacks!
---
Yea exactly and have a marker on the map for it would be great!
---
Yea cause I know when you are battling waves at a workshop when it‚Äôs down to the last few enemies the get displayed on the map and compass.
---
Nice
---
Good thing I stocked up 50k acid just by doing campfire tales when it used to activate every night
---
Oh also how much are nuclear keycards worth like if I had one would you buy it and for what?
---
It would honestly make me really happy to see this implemented.
---
No banking of perks until level 50 unfortunately
---
Need to up a special stat and choose a perk card for the next level to unlock. Once you hit level 50 everything becomes available and you can respec your toon (choose a card or move a point), or just sit on the points for future use.
---
The Nukes and Dragons character builder has a decent level mapping option so you can see where the holes are going to be in your build. Basically choose all the things you want, look at the level map, go back and fill in the holes where "no card on this level" appears with something that you might use.
---
I see them in vendors for insane amounts.Like over 2k each. But most people wont buy them for over 200. I know I wouldn't and most posts here on reddit you'll find the same.
---
they deserved it not respecting a higher level, stop pouring your resources into someone that will probably quit in a week...
---
Yes, it sounds like a case of bad luck. :-(
---
You can store built items for 1 week at workshops. Only good at the same place and I think it resets same time and day atom shop does.
---
But like others have said. Get good at powering up the plants and a few workshops get free power from the boxes.
---
Never bothered with that one since I didn't care about the boy scout stuff, 50k is impressive though.
---
Quality of life improvement right there. üôåüèΩ
---
It is possible to take a perk point in strength, for example, then scroll over and grab a card out of endurance.  You do NOT have to take a card from the specials category you chose.  
---
This is where it‚Äôs important to have a plan for the build.  Put points in special groups you need, then take whatever card will help right now.  
---
In short, don‚Äôt save up your level-ups.  Always assign the point as soon as possible.  Otherwise new cards won‚Äôt become available.  
---
My philosophy, take damage cards in your discipline as they become available.  Quality of life always comes secondary.  Besides, quality of life cards tend to create bad habits.  Like carrying far more crap than you need.
---
More level is more powerful. But it is more expensive to repair. On leveling I use lv 20 gear because is cheap and I don't need farm all the time to repair it. After a while you don't have worry about that and you could use high-end equipment without problem because the materials are plenty. I think I could return to low level gear in order to avoid keep a high amount of junk in my stash.
---
Yes, calibrated shocks is per leg, so +100 lbs total for both.
---
There is also a glitch for Excavator where you can get +200 lbs if you join the server while wearing your Excavator power armor (assuming it has calibrated shocks on both legs). It goes back to +100 if you get out of your PA and climb back in again though.
---
Yeah you can farm like 2-3k acid In about 30min-hour depending if you got lucky with server hops
---
Yeah. The avg chance is 0.65% is pretty low compared to others. Thanks for the explanation. That makes a lot of sense. The Radiums learn chance is roughly the same as Armor I heard. Regardless, 2000 scraps is pretty crazy. That's some bad RNG for me. Other people I know have had the same problem too. Roughly 1500-2000 scraps
---
I love killing these people
---
I recently got a instigating swing speed pole hook which I‚Äôm keen for my melee build to try. I currently run bloody unarmed which is ferocious, but I wanna switch it up a bit, and a tankier build could be fun. I‚Äôm stockpiling decent non-bloodied legendaries in case they ever nerf bloodied!
---
I tend to defend from outside of the zone - have found the last critter sometimes hides behind the trailer, or to the far right near the "entrance".  both spots hard to spot if you are on he cliff above (out of the zone) and sniping.  Targeting HUD on PA helps.
---
Pretty sure this is just a reward from the vault raid and not the scrap box compensation. Did you do a raid?
---
Thanks! Hadn't thought about the hip fire aspect as much. I have a bloodied dwa rw handmade I'm setting up for messing around with. Only have 4 perception tho and I like ads. I saw on a vid that the recoil pattern can change based on parts and it's not necessarily tied to words or stats
---
That only thing that won't be a lame return are ^(mosaic floors).
---
This has been around since the beginning I think.  Can‚Äôt believe it still exists, lol!!   A friend of mine still depends on this glitch to this day.
---
You get 4 bulk ammo from making it to the halfway points in the raids
---
If you completed or reached the half way point in the vault raid it will give you some
---
Yeah, I just leave mine unlocked.  If someone else needs it, or wants to stand there and farm it, I don't mind.
---
Best place for food right now. One trip there and you get meat for a week
---
There was a mod for FO4, where if your weapon was out/rasied, the dead bodies would glow until you looted everything from the body.
---
Victorcanfly on PSN add me!
---
Good question! I might convert all of my visible flooring to the mosaic tile now. People really seem to like it. I can put it on my roof with my vending machines so that I never have to see it üòÇ
---
Oh right, someone should make a price guide for items in player stalls a what to buy and sell for to see if your getting a good deal.
---
Awh yes attempted the raid few nights ago really late.  didn‚Äôt know that‚Äôs what it was for gave up  after. Stressed me out rage quit after
---
I got one a few months ago cant remember were but was not a raid
---
A tip. When the quest mark the enemies remaining I just use a melee weapon attacking the hole where the molerat hide looking at the direction indicated in the radar. Eventually, after few seconds, the molerat teleport back to the hole and will be hit by your weapon.
---
It does not. It just means you can fit more magazine on a rack, and display more guns. Oh no! Fine then throw a double budget base for Fallout 1st people. The endgame of this game is the camp, and what we can build. Just like the game grows the budget needs to grow too because there is more to do, and have.
---
It'd be nice if the player dots just wrapped around the camp logo, when players are inside a camp radius. Instead I think it's just looking at where they're positioned on the map? It does get pretty tough when there's 3 or more, then you have to kind of zoom in on your map for better precision.
---
I agree, something should be done about that.
---
They really need a tutorial for the scrip mechanic. You turn in your legendaries at the machines for "scrip" then you head on into the Berkeley springs train station and meet mama murgles who will give you a random legendary for a specific amount of scrip.
---
The machines let you exchange legendaries in return for scrip, which can be spent at the purveyor's shop in Berkeley Springs. You cannot buy legendaries directly from the machines, although sometimes they do contain an item that can be bought (maybe a glitch?).
---
No but I've definitely seen houses that were painted and a lot of these wallpapers skins are solid colors. The biggest reason I want it is so I can have multiple rooms inside my house without having to worry about one of the walls being brick, metal or whatever.
---
Zoom in on the casting couch and queue the porn music.
---
Oh shit, wrong subreddit.
---
Mine is my legacy explosive laser rifle, found, not bought.
---
Don‚Äôt let go of that bloodied handmade easily.  If you need the stash space put it on a mule.  That gun deserves a dedicated rifle build!!!   Congrats on finding it.  I just love mine.  Combined with covert ops, adrenaline, and some vats criticals you have the best gun in the game (second only to a bloodied Fixer in my opinion).
---
Man, cool Idea. I want to role play as a Realtor!
---
oh, some wall decor (ex. the vintage halloween cat) will clip under the wallpaper.
---
I got Easter eggs, unsurprisingly, at Easter shortly after I joined. I saw a Santa and Radstag/reindeer statue thing for the first time the other day though, was pretty cool. You're right tho, Christmas stuff is _exceedingly_ rare
---
Sounds like a fun time. I like the nuke drop to add some excitement lol.
---
I think the game needs more options to encourage playing without mutations. 
---
As it stands, for some of them, there is really no good reason NOT to use mutations, and yes Class freak helps considerably depending on the mutation. 
---
Some of the mutations, such as speed demon, have such minor negative effects it might as well not even exist (it's not like food is hard to come by) or have negative effects that are easy to work around (such as grounded)
---
So more to the point, currently all of my characters have at least one mutation.  There are some perks that there is absolutely no reason not to use because the downside is minor, or fit a build so well that not having it puts you at a disadvantage.
---
Easily the Mire. I originally settled around the Savage Divide, moved to the Mire for a while, went back to the Savage Divide for quite some time but got bored with the scenery. Eventually, I resettled to a new location in, you guessed it, the Mire. Loving the eerie sounds, dim lighting and light rays coming through the heavy jungle canopy to give you the "lost in the dense forest" vibes. I'm never lost, but I still feel like the Mire has lots of secrets that we haven't discovered yet.
---
I always thought those were just my items in case I wanted to buy them back (in the event I made a oopsie)
---
How can people play the game without marsupial?
---
Thanks for the heads up. I got it for 2500 from a vendor.  I've heard that any bloodied handmade is good, even a 1*.  I'm a bloodied build, and I know a 1* bloodied LMG is hard to beat with anything else that's not silenced. (I have a bffr lmg and be 50 cal, both are nice but a 1* B LMG is still a force to be reckoned with)
---
Me too! Sometimes even seeing the word purified water makes me thirsty.
---
You are delusional if you think 76 will be supported for years, and also fail to realize that it‚Äôs 10 dollars because the game flopped harder than a Pro soccer player. What they‚Äôre doing is milking the few loyal fans.  I care about 15 dollars because as I‚Äôve said, I became wealthy 15 dollars at a time, and you don‚Äôt understand that, which is ok.  
---
It‚Äôs about principal.  Enjoy making other people rich.
---
Yeah, I don't remember seeing the Christmas stuff until a few months back (although, seeing that player vending wasn't a thing, it doesn't surprise me that I wouldn't have stumbled upon it before).  The animatronic Santa and snowman are disturbing in the best way.
---
Kinda what I figured. I mean theyre used by everyone for a reason.
---
Personally I hate marsupial from a strictly aesthetic standpoint. I feel weird jumping so high even though it‚Äôs so useful.
---
You and me both. I‚Äôm still cursing over here.
---
My oldest has had a PC since he was 6 years old, he's 16 now, obviously we monitored his usage and that.. Wifes comp is in the Girls room and they play Roblox and Minecraft etc. But I've always been a PC building, modding, electronics kinda guy, so I would imagine there are households like mine, but not a lot. Generally, adults are on PC and consoles are more of a kids thing.
---
Treasure maps for PA base plans.
---
I agree. Feggin' jet pack soaks AP. I wish it used less.
---
I was talking about banking points while leveling prior to 50.
---
Yeah if they made it where you could jump higher depending on how long you hold the button like mario itd be great.
---
They really need a "Basic Bitch" perk that gives you bonuses for not having mutations and/or not having every piece of gear legendary.
---
My stupid ass thought the empty spots on the map meant you could bank points....
---
Maybe in Wastelanders they‚Äôll be a reputational cost with certain factions. fallout Lore would suggest that the Enclave and BOS May object.
---
Well I mean if you put it that way.. Lol
---
Usually yes, but on rare occasion it may fail to update properly and show a prior players exchanged items.
---
Well, we have all of these emotional scars. Newer players won't have many of the opportunities we pre-order people did to experience this game in all of it's initial glory.
---
I got it the day after those 50% off sales ended because my friend said that it was a good game...
---
We are not friends anymore
---
On PC i can use left click or right click, idk if there are two different click options on consoles, but they could look at utilizing one of those I guess for selecting locations only
---
  I web ordered it on black friday last year...(tricentennial edition) was still 60$ on sale.  
---
2 weeks later when it arrived, I was really POed to learn it required PS+ (noowhere in ad copy was that listed as a requirement, and although its written on the packaging, it was photoshopped out on all sellers websites - bestbuy, amazon, gamestop, you name it)
---
Not having PS+, I almost took it back just for that reason.  
---
But by the time it arrived, the price dropped again for xmas sales, so I couldn't return it for what I paid for it.
---
So I bit the bullet, and paid full price for the PS+ subscription...
---
Did you even play Fo: NV?    
---
76 is a dream compared to the freezes and crashes I had playing that one with that one.  
---
Anyway, as a new character in january, the problems the higher levels were complaining about didnt affect me - no PA, not dealing with high level stuff.  By the time I got to that point, issues had been patched out.
---
700 hours in, and I occasionally run across some frustration, but hey, its still fun to play. And IMHO, its nowhere near as bad as it's made out to be.
---
For sure.  There's a few times it's annoying ( like in front of Fort Defiance before they added the extra staircase), but for every 1 time it's hinders there's 100 more instances where it's helpful.
---
Maybe if it short jumped with a button tap and high jumped with a press?
---
I have a bloodied LMG stashed away on a mule; never used it.  Think I got it from the Purveyor.  I heard those things use ammo like crazy.  How do you stay on top of it with ffr??  Are you in power armor a lot?  Using the stabilized perk?   I ask because I‚Äôve never run a dedicated heavy guns build.... mostly rifle and pistol builds.
---
...but I guess it no longer works, right?
---
Enclave might be tough, since you buy the serums from them.  But I completely agree about the BOS.
---
Wow amazing, this game truly has so much content. I still have so much scrapping to look forward to. Feels good to know that no matter how much I play the game, I'll always have thousands of items left to scrap.
---
In Sea of Thieves i was given a really cool sail cosmetic for my participation in the technical alfa tests, it was nice. I dont expect the same from Fallout but it would be a welcomed suprise
---
I would totally use it, even if that was the name of the perk. 
---
I'd also love a Fashionista perk that gives you a bonus for wearing a full set of a single type of gear.
---
Yeah this is what i'd want
---
So nice and... *Clean* mmm tastee
---
Pokemon Sword and Sheild were released a couple of weeks before Thanksgiving and had some pretty big cuts at some stores for Black Friday, it's back to the old price.
---
It might be related to enemies already killed by other players (which happens a lot at Whitespring) respawning in a broken state.
---
you should try it
---
They need to add a few songs and not just renditions of them. The actual songs. Like ring of fire by johnny cash or country roads by john denver. Examples of songs I personally would think would make it is Runnaway by The Beach Boys, the Avenged Sevenfold cover and a few more 50s and 60s hits. I mean itd be great to have more variety instead of hearing jukebox saturday night every 3 songs.
---
Don't be mad at yourself. The Atomic Shop was mostly empty at the time, and Bethesda hadn't implemented the in-game "News" advertisements at that early point. They also had one-day sales going on. Almost no one even opened the Atomic Shop, and even fewer people saw the one-day sales at all. Once people started noticing the Atomic Shop, it was too late. For a brief period, you could still share or sell Atomic Shop paints, clothing, and CAMP items, but Bethesda quickly patched that to force people to buy from the shop.
---
Every now and then, Bethesda accidentally re-enables sharing of Atomic Shop items in a patch or a Tuesday maintenance...
---
it's been a thing since patch 13. or was it 12?
---
hmmm.
---
Hard pass. 
---
Yes budget should increase. No, not by spending atoms.
---
You should put roofs, set up turrets, display weapons and use Whitespring's camp items for the interior decoration
---
Username checks out.
---
Lmao yeah. Itd be alright. Or if the bonuses were given for it in general kinda like skyrim and the heavy armor perks.
---
Whenever I‚Äôm bored or waiting for events, I head to Morgantown and parkour from building to building.  Marsupial makes it so that as long as I get a running jump, I can usually make it even across roads from one to the other.  I‚Äôd love to see someone make a course or follow the students who fought rooftops vs ground
---
That could be
---
There‚Äôs alternative methods for learning armor mods.
---
I know you‚Äôre going to hate hearing this, but turning in treasure maps will net you most, if not all mods for armor.  I‚Äôve barely scrapped any trapper, marine or robot armor aside from what I loot, and I have everything save one robot mod.  Granted, I‚Äôve been playing that character since launch, but I‚Äôve known almost everything for months.  Add in quest and event rewards, and you can learn everything organically without grinding out hundreds of armor pieces.
---
I have four playable characters, and transfer every map I get to my main.  Between maps and checking robot vendors, I‚Äôve gotten all the dense mods, with extras to give to a second stealth character that uses an explosive rifle.
---
I heard that there's still a bug with the frames that means if you switch from one to the other they become 'broken'.
---
That all the resistances lower and the only way to fix it is to find another frame to put all your parts on to, hop in and out a few times, then load into another server and do the same?
---
Was that ever fixed?
---
[deleted]
---
Ah I did a bunch but didnt get anything, how rare are they?
---
Let me guess, this settlement needs our help...
---
I didn't intentionally seek mutations until after L75 or so.
---
I had gotten them prior, but didn't understand how they worked, so was just as glad to see it had gone.
---
Then I got marsupial by accident.  (Lost it the same way.)  But after I lost it, I realized what I had been missing, so sought out the serum.  
---
Had 6 at one point, but am now down to 4.
---
Debating adding another.
---
That would be awesome
---
It‚Äôs rare but that bitch will sometimes payout
---
That‚Äôs not how it works. You cash your legendaries in for scrip. Then you head to Berkeley springs to spend scrip.
---
I‚Äôve got a SE one I can trade with on PC
---
&gt;Any tips for finding the last monster that is just absent at a workshop?
---
Berry mentats let me find them if they are somewhere around the base (I occasionally get them underground, but it's not often)
---
If the mentats won't find them, there is a good chance something else got their attention and dragged them away when they spawned (e.g. if there was Scorched nearby and a wave fo ghouls spawn, the ghoul may charge the scorched, if he is lucky and wins he is too far away from the workshop to return to it's original activity)
---
You can only choose a perk card with a level up if that level up is equal to or greater than the minimum level to get that perk. 
---
For example, I think Super Duper becomes available at level 35. If you leveled up all the way to 50 and had saved 49 level ups, you could choose that one until you had chosen 33 other perks (2-34). You can‚Äôt just buy the ones that have a higher level requirement with a ‚Äòlower level‚Äô level up.
---
Totally agree. Like if you played during beta you get some outfit.
---
but the benefit of speed demon is subtle - you don't really notice it until its gone.. then you really miss it.
---
Very true, there's too many disadvantages in not being mutated.  It should be more balanced to either side.
---
Not me, still looking for pieces as I continue to elove.  Right now I want a AAE handmade and couple specific 3* vanguard scout armour pieces.
---
Im level 127 and Ive been thinking about it for a while. Im trying to debate if i wanna keep the strength perks or intelligence because i need some more luck points.. I everyonce in a while do melee but I wanna get a two shot explosive fixer or handmade. I need one of em because I need a back up when im stealthing through west tek and get caught with my pants down holding my instigating "non explosive" lever action rifle. It can handle its own, but id rather have a spray and pray then get back to one hitting everything while in stealth.
---
When it doesn‚Äôt progress for me like that I usually wait it out and it will suddenly complete... it‚Äôs that nice public server lag. Starting to think they‚Äôll never fix these things üòû
---
Agree, I remember the first time I took a rad-x while I had speed demon and marsupial on - Hated it.
---
LMB or RT to shoot.
---
Unfortunately not, it sucks...
---
I can imagine it was painful to go 30 levels without choosing new stats or cards, especially if you were soloing it and not tagging along with other high level toons.
---
"White Springs Casino" rolls off the tongue.
---
Treasure maps from the divide and east. Distant thunder drops PA plans. Black mountain ordinance has 2 paints. And for farming technical data you wana loot those round filing cabinents and the desks that spawn in the military wing of the enclave bunker. Those desks spawn all around the map but that type will have data. Going into the militart wing i can usually pull 4 datas or more but idk what up with forbiden knowlage. I drop my excess data every time i do the quest, fill up 4 more, and it will only take 1 data. Sometimes it takes all 4 but most of the time its just 1 or 2.  Idk how many ranks of paints there are but im pretty sure the last one is elder paint.
---
thx
---
Did you listen to the latest? Wasn't it fantastic? Especially that Mr. Graul character... What a gem.
---
Oh, my sweet summer child... üòú 
---
Check every single container, and welcome to the wasteland.
---
I really love where the cranberry bog meets the savage divide. If you draw a big circle around fort defiance and Watoga, pretty much that area. Something about it actually gives me some Skyrim vibes. Like the plains west of whiterun type of vibes.
---
Interesting. I could have sworn the other day there was an exchange machine with a legendary pipe weapon in the inventory. It gave me the option to spend the scrip on it but I didn‚Äôt cause it was trash. So I guess that could be an option as well (unless I‚Äôm trippin on the Daytipper)
---
Don't count out that mysterious Mr. Graul. That dude was the star of the show. What talent!
---
This
---
Scrap extra weapons to learn mods and take/defend public workshops to get easy plans.
---
They're said as much, and to go back on supporting the game would give way to legal repercussions. 
---
Please stop with the bragging, I've said I don't care. But if you classify yourself as wealthy you have to see the competitive difference between all your vast, vast wealth and what one of us peasants makes in an hour or two. And if we want to spend our shillings on supporting a game we like, what's the harm in that? How are we "suckers" for paying for stuff we want and want to support? I guarantee you've spent/"wasted" money on something you liked. _So why would you do that?_ I wouldn't judge you like that, I'm not even really asking.
---
Oh boy... Thanks!
---
Sometimes an item from the last user is left behind and can be taken out by the next. It's a glitch.
---
im the same with that clock lmao i didn't even know they were giving free stuff
---
"Dose."  Heh.  Serums...dose...
---
Having the flu makes this more entertaining than it should be.
---
Junkies builds r alot of fun if u want high dmg without being a glass canon. And pistols can work decent if ur stealthy and use vats.
---
That's a bug where sometimes the last player's scripped item is still in the machine. Sometimes you can find neat stuff that way, but it's not how it works.
---
Once you master that, we can move onto WASD/left thumbstick.
---
thanks joe
---
I have it, I was disappointed that it didn't tell time.
---
Got it, thanks man!
---
No thanks. All this does is reset the grind.
---
If you stayed strong and true for Fallout 76 then that's completely fine. The game has tons of potential and has good qualities. If you stayed strong and true for Bethesda Austin however, then have some standards. I wouldn't even defend the devs of that studio. Even with all the terrible management of the company, the devs have also shown bouts of incompetence.
---
Also, the only technical gripe you had early on was the 400 lbs limit? Really? Maybe you really don't have any standards.
---
damn, isn't that a lil advanced?
---
It's been more fun lately, thanks to your workshop turrets shooting each other, destroying random objects, etc.
---
Lmao I‚Äôve typed dose into my phone so many times that it thinks I‚Äôm right
---
Cowboys don't use stealth , but junkies sounds like it could be fun and work with the charcter, a guy is so high off his gourd he thinks it's 1876
---
True, the focus on purity was probably a later development. Still, BOS seems to have lots of fans- imagine the complaining if those fans have to lose some mutations to fully join! üòÇ
---
This one can be a bit tricky to pull off because they are so tenacious about running after you, but if you come across a group of mole miners and kill all of them but one, the survivor will walk from dead miner to dead miner and look down at them, as if checking to see if they are truly dead.  If he doesn't detect you and start shooting missiles at your face that is.
---
Rifleman is actually working out for me now that I got the mechanic down and perks right. Only problem is getting that gear. 
---
I also use maxed heavy when I feel the need. (Fav.gun is the lmg especially once you prime it because  .308 is no longer an issue for how fast it shoots.)
---
I run with a 1 star bloodied gauss now and all the sneak attack perks. Radicool. And any armor I can find to help with dr at low health. 
---
It does about 16 to 1800 per sneak shot. 
---
Idk man... honestly unless you have some good armor bloodied/high rad is no fun but I play it anyway.
---
Psychobuff and whiskey and the perk that doubles alcohol helps with more dmg too.
---
‚ÄúHere have some strawberries! I don‚Äôt like them.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúOh I can I‚Äôm deadly allergic. Can I have some grapes?‚Äù
---
‚ÄúYou want grapes you ungrateful little bastard!‚Äù 
---
Maybe the player didn‚Äôt use any of that useless ammo you gave them? Maybe they needed some 45 rounds? What are they going to do with those little amounts of useless ammo anyway? They can‚Äôt sell it or break it down. 
---
The player was a massive utter douche shooting you but giving useless stuff is also pointless. They needed some 45, you really couldn‚Äôt spare a couple dozen of rounds?
---
You had to go and call it treasure vault didnt you ? Now im getting all kinds of Borderland-ish feelings about this......
---
This a great tip! Unfortunately I'm only using coloured lights, which need wired. I see the need if you're connecting them to a computer to control them, but I don't, it's a pain in the arse. HaHa.
---
I love the lmg , a tse lmg is a forced to be reckoned with
---
I must admit it was fun lol
---
True but made a fun video out of it lol, still feel bad for the lvl 8 though not his fault his friend was a douche
---
you know, your asking for paywalling another feature because that won't be free....
---
I am getting a similar one but for the SBQ when I am given the flux at the end it shows me being awarded them but when I look in my junk they are not there it has happend about 3 times now.
---
I love the science dog meme reference.

My fiancee is dyslexic.  She's one of the worst spellers I've ever met.  She types it "dose" every time, no matter how many times I point it out.
---
It's kinda nuts, in terms of her memory.  She has a memory like a steel trap when it comes to most things.  WAY better than my memory.  Yet when it comes to language, especially written language?  Forget it.  Her brain just doesn't latch onto it and retain it.
---
I don't have any mutations. I cant be bothered to deal with them and I like my perks as they are.
---
I use the billboards to write on.
---
I find the heads look best when you have all of them up on 1 wall like a hunters display
---
It's just great these days. Anyone who dares to make a comment on how truly greedy Bethesda has become gets only downvotes. Il' hopefully can surpass your points...
---
For my main character I use mutations (melee and heavy weapons - lev 147), my second character is "clean"  (sniper sneak build - lev 52)
---
Depending what kind of build you are running,  mutations are mandatory or useless. 
---
Don't forget that you have to sacrifice 5 luck perk points
---
Performance has been fine for me.
---
Your cpu is quite weak, so don't try to use any of the eye-candy settings.
---
Wait till you find the camera. The advanced controls are something else.
---
More than just wood roof models would be nice.
---
While I believe there are zealots who refuse to purchase atom shop items/ F01st out of principle, the Ranger Armors, scrapboxes and scraptrons don't lie. I see a lot of them out there. If we were offered a 800lb larger stash upgrade/increase in the atom shop, there would be outrage, riots in the streets, chaos: and immediate purchase by lots of players. Same with this bungalow idea.
---
 They aren't going to put this type of content up for free, sorry if you don't like that answer. If people oppose the thought of purchase so much, they simply won't create it in the first place. That might not be an "up-votable" response, but it's the practical one. So, the real question is, do we want this instanced bungalow or not, not should it be free or not.
---
Or a visitor book where when they ‚Äúactivate‚Äù it, their username is logged so you can see who‚Äôs been there
---
Yes please, we want another possibility to spend our money...
---
Yes.
---
It's always humorous loading in at a Golf Course Camp, the place loads, then half a 2nd later, parts blow up, walls break, it crumbles. Using mk1 turrets, not even elevated, but all over the Green. HaHa. The Ghouls don't even have guns for fuck sake.
---
So still playable on my hardware? What are your system specs?
---
A vault of treasure hunters/thieves all together in 1 place
---
And proper ranger helmets. The one now looks like it has a bowling ball for a helmet.
---
Here's an example of how the helmet should have looked.

---
That seems like such an obvious answer and I didn't try.
---
Just because people buy it doesn‚Äôt mean it should be there. No thanks.
---
I personally think it's well worth it.  Apart from the QoL stuff like scrapbox / tent and atoms / skins etc, I think it adds a whole new dimension to the game. When I'm in my own private world, I imagine im more like Will Smith in Legend :p
---
Yeah junkies is fun. I have mime use commando cus it pairs well together. And i run vanguard armor so that im tanky.
---
My newest character is a Bloodied suicide bomber. Wears a BOS bomber jacket, and life saving armor. Has Adrenal reaction, &amp; healing factor mutation. Weapon of choice is a Bloodied boxing glove. Perked with nerd rage, mysterious savior, revenant, demo expert, grenadier, and last laugh. Carries orbital strikes, &amp; Nuka grenades.  Its a blast to play.
---
Fomo meets lazyness or a very limited developer team.
---
Maybe hes not tired right now. Sorry had to try re loading your game.
---
I like the idea of being by myself on it but I cant pay for the...uh..$9.99 I think? But I also like making friends eventhough I wanna have friends to play with
---
Or ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt knowww the gun was loaded‚Äù that one gives me a headache
---
Someone's gonna get banned for duping.
---
Yea. But my mom has Amazon and all that but "doesnt trust her credit card on the internet"
---
Keep in mind you are skirting the bottom of the minimum requirements. Any performance issues you encounter are pretty much all because of your hardware and not the game.
---
Noted, are ini tweaks still allowed? or is it bannable
---
I actually made a playlist from the one on spotify for appalachia radio and added the wanderer and my own select.
---
I built a Junkie Sneak/Commando recently and it has been a blast to play! 
---
Primary weapon is a JE Handmade with Demolition/Grenadier fully perked. Use 4 pcs Vanguard and 1 pc Chameleon and can tank when needed.
---
Do a little research on Vault 79 and the Wastelanders update, you'll see why I don't mean Vault 96 haha
---
Whoa here I thought it was just the chems man.... I guess the truth really is out there... That's heavy
---
Like Borderlands
---
there's a camera??? yeah, can't play this.

You should be old enough to get a bank account I would have thought , if not, get your mum to make one for you and then use that maybe?  
---
You can tell her that way that it wouldnt be putting her account at risk since it would be a new account with only as much money as they let you have.  
---
Personally, I would say thats too much hassel for what you get back though
---
If you like it, then yes, totally fair price.  Sounds actually like a deal to me. With rifleman a d of you use vats, seems like a grwat gun. 
---
That being said.... People's opinions differ.
---
How so? Happened at random &amp; reported it. Their glitch not mine.
---
I just read through your post, excellent bud. I've recently rebuilt my camp and noticed a lot of your points too, re-built it almost exactly the same way it was since January. I did gain a fair bit more budget, and my Water Purifiers are definitely producing water quicker, maybe even twice as fast to fill. They possibly changed them ages ago and I didn't notice until I rebuilt, or mine were originally glitched and now they work as normal...
---
-
---
There was also a "rumour" a while back that scrapping crops could create "phantom" budget still being taken up. Any info on that? I believe it was fixed.
---
I only use candles, lamps and coloured lights. Unfortunately we have to wire up the coloured lights. Which is annoying cause I don't need to attach them to a computer.
---
I've tried to minimize my 2nd floor pieces but it's hard. I have 2 floors built around the outside of a small cave. Can you use carpets to cover gaps possibly? I.E. 2nd floor piece, gap, another floor piece, and just chuck a carpet over the gap, would players fall through the carpet?
---
Cheers!!
---
His mistake is really a good idea, the machine should hold every item scripted in, then people could buy something someone else thought was junk, even if its full price.
---
Just like that guy who reported an exploit and is now banned, yeah.
---
Wow, thanks for the info! I'll definitely check out nukesdragons!
---
"They should put MORE stuff on the atomic shop" is not a mainstream argument.
---
Yea true but having the account in general would help me with other stuff to. I could get more free trials if I want
---
Y‚Äôall are saying they hiked back up the prices after Black Friday, which if they even did (I don‚Äôt remember) it dropped within a few weeks after again.
---
Boatfly syringer can make you alot of acid
---
As far as advice for buying.  If you see something you like, message the seller and ask if they'll take less. Worse they can say is no.  Even if in some people's eyes you overpay.  Who cares, it's your charecter, your caps, your fun.  That's my philosophy.
---
Yes it works pretty darn good. Two hits long range and I can vats pretty far away. Headshots do like 1400. Im gonna see how deadmans sprint does. Id almost be unstoppable if I get a lucky streak. I need to study the perks more. The gun makes me feel like cowboy dan. Lol
---
Yeah unfortunately since they did the public even patch it no longer activates every night
---
Well that‚Äôs reassuring. Best to keep quiet in such a situation than.
---
Totally worth it.
---
Completely changes the game.
---
I role solo, but you can have 7 freinds and you on your server
---
idk maybe ur right and I‚Äôm just trolling at this point though.
---
That is true, but can I offer you 1 piece of advice, try not to waste too much money on online games, I have personally squandered away a lot of money on games, money never seems like a lot when you dont have any bills to pay, now I cringe remembering how much I have actually spent, especially on games I dont play any more
---
I think you got a fair price.  That is a very nice sniper weapon.
---
They need a kos switch, like kos people who don't kill things attacking your camps.
---
Or when the non-legendary super mutant explodes and hurls the robot into some long grass somewhere.
---
Haven‚Äôt played since spring. Did they finally add vaults with npcs?
---
Still works, just isn't as consistent because of the event timer. Bloodbug Proboscis are 2 acid each, just let the bugs keep respawning.
---
Yeah... Bethesda will figure it out eventually, don't worry. Just like the Machine Gun turret inventory duping method.
---
We need a flipping letter sign, like the one's in Watoga. And make it where we can type in 30 characters or so, and it changes through the words. It could be set up like how we rename weapons or something. ü§î
---
Make it like the division where you get a vertical glow showcasing loot. Or make it like destiny where you have a glow when an engram drops. Or Just make the corpse emit a light
---
Power armored cowboy , no helmet because i gotta wear the hat ,
---
If you do a message with the small letters, blueprint it when you're done so you don't have to do it again if you move camp or remodel. It also makes it easier to edit the base statement at a later date.
---
Yea, I dont spend much on online games. I'll buy them but that's basically it
---
Checked still duplicated.
---
I run a stealthy commando build with no mutations. And, as Todd would say, ‚ÄúIt just works.‚Äù
---
(No, really. It does actually work for me!)
---
ok, just a warning though its a very slippery slope
---
there's 2 sides to that story.  Bethesda seemed to indicate the dude who got banned had abused the glitch he found hundreds of times, guy claims he didn't.  So the truth is in that sandwich, somewhere.  
---
In any case I'd encourage you to report this.  If you haven't been duplicating it over and over you should be fine.  If it's a new dupe method and doesn't require any elaborate 3rd party tools it could be a major issue if other less scrupulous people figure it out.  Even posting it here has no doubt set the gears in motion.
---
Accident or no report it or not Bethesda are savages when it comes to banning people but I know of a few people that duped on accident the first few months the game came out and didn't get banned... Its a different story now
---
It will be the vault that finally reveals we are all living in a simulated VR experience.  "The Treasure of Appalachia" is truth, which will set you free.
---
Or you know they'll just be a bunch of mirelurks and shit.
---
Im able to sweep west tek very easily. I need to get the auto target perk and deadmans sprint. I wanna get a tse handmade or something to be my backup for when I get spotted accidentally.
---
No not yet
---
Lol i see most people have a variation of that
---
he intentionally used a cheat engine multiple times to test an exploit. He didn't even report the exploit himself, his friend did. You randomly came across a glitch and will be fine.
---
Don't claim workshops if you don't want PvP. Always crouch when in a workshop so d-bags don't come in and merc you.
---
Or they should beep until they are looted, like the code piece guys.
---
Meathook Boxing glove Deathclaw gauntlet and bear arm count as unarmed and one handed if im not mistaken. Basically the ones where it looks like youre doing a punching attack.
---
Understandable and I‚Äôm good with the gears getting going to fix the issue, but at the same time Bethesda has done jack shit for customer relations and I for one don‚Äôt want to lose my account because I stumbled upon a glitch. And nope won‚Äôt go into the method specifics but literally was just in my vending inventory.
---
At this point I‚Äôd take anything to help locate.
---
I don't think they do no. They are as strong as the Steel walls though, but take far less materials to build. Maybe more concrete, but everyone has more than enough of that! ;)
---
Oh also, while there are those that grief anybody they can, don‚Äôt get too freaked out if you have some high level come barreling at you. There‚Äôs a good chance they may drop you some goodies. If I get a exceptionally good low level legendary drop and there‚Äôs someone low level around, I usually give it to them.
---
Worth it! No regrets!
---
What do u play on?
---
I used the tse lever for a while but I upgraded to the be lever action if ur ok with being low health you can one shot most enemies easily you just have to make sure you stay sneaked
---
Are you wearing a full set and is anything broken?
---
I'm on the fence on whether it's worth it. As a person who's 1st month is expiring this week. 
---
Maybe In small chunks. I'm thinking about maybe re-subscribing occasionally. 
---
It's awful lonely. I'm not one of those who feel the game is empty but when I'm my private server it does. 
---
BUT it is great for farming resources/events/workshops, especially those that often get looted often/players one shot everything/players attack because their bored. 
---
So far the free outfits are nice, especially the advance ranger. 
---
I think the dance emotes were definitely worth it, at least for a single month anyways. (Side note: I'd think it would be wrong if Bethesda doesn't introduce other dances for non 1st players)
---
You get back more atoms than what the subscription costs. Will you use them all? That's up for debate. 
---
And I will definitely be re-subscribing when wastelanders comes out. I just don't want players coming around and killing all the enemies or solving the puzzles. I want to experience the game as a whole. 
---
Back th the bad side. The tent feels to OP. You can drop it almost anywhere, anytime, empty your loot and go. Maybe if it was on a cool down. 
---
The tent is too damn clean, they should sell skins for it to gice it a more survivalist feel. 
---
I feel the scrap box may make me dependant on 1st. I don't feel as any amount of scrap would make feel like I have enough so if I fill up my stash with weapons and armor, the only other place for scrap to go is on my person.
---
Q1 2020 is npcs/wastelanders
---
vault 94, 96, and 63 were originally planned to be raids/difficult missions, so far only 94 was released.
---
Full set at 200% condition
---
Both are unarmed perks but benefit from melee mutations.  So its iron fists/incisor/martial artist perks for damage wirh twisted limbs AND talons in mutations.  I also highly recommend sneak/escape artist/bloody mess/blocker.  If you're bloodied specced radicool/nerd rage/dodgy/serendipity are indispensable for melee.
---
They have been saving me money for about 3 months, they just keep posting stuff I bought months ago. ü§î
---
More of a Jim Raynor from Star Craft!
---
But with 1st giving you 1600 Atoms to blow each month there will be a need to have more items, and also the ability to use these new items.
---
try putting both items into your stash and then take one out and restart the game. 
---
this happens to me like once a month and i never really get dupes.
---
I saw someone with a Radstag with red Rudolf noses on it and I was sooooo bummed because I must have missed it last year
---
RALEIGH CLAYS NOT DEAD
---
You can get pretty close by building on the edges close to your friends camps and using the rest of the bubble as back and side yards. It would look a lot better in places like Morgantown but I'd imagine you can't build in those places because people would block off too many areas of good loot or quest areas
---
I pulled a Mr fuzzy outfit from a treasure mound in my private lobby
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_weapons
---
Bear Arm
---
Boxing glove
---
Death tambo
---
Deathclaw gauntlet
---
Knuckles
---
Meat hook
---
Mole miner gauntlet
---
Power fist
---
PC
---
At 16 her name would need to be on the account
---
So you can essentially double-dip in both and just wreck everything? 
---
Thanks kind of cool.
---
Gave a copy of a weapon to a friend to test. We both had the same gun equipped. He gave it back after
---
* Shotguns were nerfed, I'd just remove those perks.  Better to get a handmade or fixer for close quarters.
---
* You don't need to carry lockpick 24/7, just slot them in when needed.  Personally the only time I use these perks is for silo runs of vault 94 missions that require lockpicking.  There's nothing in that safe you are passing up that you can't live without, I promise.
---
* Natural resistance is a wasted perk.  You can cure disease for free at the water fountain at whitesprings and disease cures/antibiotics are a dime a dozen.  Better to slot in fireproof to help protect you from injuring or killing yourself with that tse lever.  Personally I run with 3 ranks fireproof and dense chest mod to help counter explosives including in PvP.
---
* Green thumb isn't an always on perk.  slot it in when you need it otherwise this is a wasted slot.
---
* Travel agent is unnecessary for 24/7 usage, imo just focus on hitting caps max and you don't need this perk at all.
---
Beyond all that, I feel like this build is just too generic.  You don't really have anything to push your damage up to what I'd consider normal levels.  
---
At the least add bloody mess to luck.
---
Damn, lost another one.
---
They call me the space cowboy
---
Does crouching just get rid of your name or something?
---
Yea that one is garbage
---
I think mutations are essential late game especially for bloodied builds with adrenal reaction
---
That is super helpful, I guess I have my work cut out for me. 
---
Might have to add Chameleon there if I'm going for the sneak perks.
---
Thanks! &lt;3
---
maybe i'll learn it. maybe.
---
Fellow Discord-er I presume? And, Yes, I agree. The Ranger helmets are waaay too round and dark, with those iconic red eyes being but a fading memory...
---
Mole Miner Gaunlet is definitely Falls in the "unarmed" category.   I found this out completely by accident when I removed all of my melee perks and the damage rating remained the same.  I then removed my Iron Fist perk and it dropped back down to it's base damage.  Interestingly enough, though, the Martial Artist perk does cut the weight of the gauntlet by the corresponding amount.
---
(smokes a cigar) Yes....yes...you slowly slice that cake you dirty little....I mean what?
---
Thanks for the free wallpaper but after applying it and having to redo all my walls the chance of me buying a future wallpaper to replace it is about zero without that being fixed.
---
Go for it! I'd love to hear.
---
\#shameless lol
---
Yeah but if that account gets compromised its not the main bank account used and would only contain the money that was put in there by her
---
Some could definitely benefit in late game applications.
---
Here's my min/max rifle guy

---
Max out your rifle perks and get bloody mess at the very least. If you use vats then move all those strength points to luck and get some critical related stuff. Gun-fu is good as a rank 1, automatically switching targets makes sniping fun. Adrenaline is solid and will net more damage than demo expert by far.
---
Demo expert is really weak now sadly, and adds very little damage, I would only run it if your full on min/maxed and have left over points.
---
still just ash heap farming
---
word on the sub is that the upcoming holiday event could have it as a drop (as well as other rare plans)
---
He was banned for repeatedly testing to a point that it was justifiably him abusing the exploit
---
Wait..... this isn't Beta???
---
the armor itself is only supposed to grant +100 carry weight, it causing +200 carry weight is a glitch that is triggered when you join a server while already wearing the full suit.
---
Never had a console can't imagine I'd be able to use it, RSI and all that.

Use these sites to learn about the perks and legendary effects and see how they interact.  Plan a build in advance, and don't be one of those people posting down the line: "I'm lvl 50, just randomly took perks that seemed cool or helped me carry more junk and now I can't survive, help!"

I cannot get my inflections to match Roberts, as he has a sort of accent that comes through when he talks. I also can't get my voice to reach as high as Roberts. Sadly, I can only do well with a deeper voice... Let me know if you need someone like that. I've got a podcast mic on standby and NCH software to help with any sound editing that I do üòâüëç
---
Even with calibrated shocks on both legs?
---
We all know Bethesda's version, yeah. If I were OP,  I would keep quiet.
---
If I were op I‚Äôd tell them that‚Äôs just me though
---
Aww shoot
---
Thanks!
---
That... is an interesting distinction. Okay, I'll have to check out the Iron Fist perk on it too! &lt;3
---
Some people are fine risking their account, some are not.
---
with the calibrated it grants +50 per leg, and +100 for the full suit. totaling 200.. BUT that same glitch can bump it up to +300 total. exiting power armor resets the bonus back to only the +100 (+200 with calibrated on both legs)
---
if there's something I really want for my camp, and it won't suck up the whole camp budget, I'll look for plans.  I think the only thing ive used atoms on has been repair kits
---
Haha exactly! But I feel like we‚Äôre both assigning the risk to each other‚Äôs solution and not our own üòÇü§£
---
Yup!
---
Yeah, probably.
---
Every single game gets cheaper over time.  Spending even a fraction of s second worrying about this is unproductive.
---
if you punch or swipe like you have claws it is unarmed. if you swing with 1 hand (no power armor) it is 1 handed. the meat hook is currently mis-classified as both unarmed and 1 handed
---
Best luck perks for critical pistol would be Critical Savy, Better Criticals, Bloody Mess, Starched Genes (for eagle eyes).
---
You'll also want Concentrated Fire in perception. Weak points increase critical hit damage too. If a head is 2x damage, you get 2x to critical damage too.
---
That's okay. :) We'll be casting in the spring for Season 2
---
I have never experienced this glitch, I have shocks on both legs so I usually have 200 carry weight, since I bought the paint job I am only getting 100, even after removing the paint.
---
 i did not know that. I must have just gotten lucky searching for meds.
---
You can be proud of how many hours you‚Äôve sunk into a terrible game developed by a company that knowingly and willingly put out an unfinished product and then, a year later, asked players to pay $100 annually, more than the game itself, for content that should‚Äôve already been in the game at launch. 
---
And yes I bought it when it launched and although I finished it. They will never get another preorder from me. Vote with your wallets. Let this game go and hold them accountable on future products.
---
Nice, i didnt think about that cause i dont have the plan, what vendor did you get it from?
---
Mod plans you can buy from Vendor Bots, they're not rare. Except Ultracite.
---
Paint plans, there's several for T-60, via Forbidden Knowledge, that's a heavy grind. T-51 only had Nuke Cola paint from an unmarked quest. X-01 has one paint available to buy from a single vendor, Military Paint. Nuke Quantum paint can be obtained from another unmarked quest. There are no other in game paints for any PA.
---
Parts. The T-Series and Raider Plans are the only ones not available through quests or purchase. Treasure Maps only. It's the biggest fucking grind in the game. I've maxed T-51b, nearly got all T-45 &amp; T-60. I've done about 1000+ maps. Seems like a slog but you get so many plans and scrappable weapons, it's worth it.
---
I run a Power Armour garage on Xbox, if you need any tips, mods, full sets, advice, just gimme a shout, and anyone else!
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Yes they are allowed. Not sure what actually has any effect though.
---
Non-shared camp blueprints is what keeps me from making a new character.
---
I can drop trade gear IF i wanted but I don't want to have to farm all those plans again (camp building being a large part of the game for me)
---
You can randomly find serums in orange crates and they only last the duration of the match.
---
There would be too many map markers. Itd get frustrating like whn you have to many quests open
---
I ran without for a long time, but a couple of months ago I decided that since the downsides were so minimal and the upside so positive and nearly all high levels I saw had them I might as well as I was handicapping myself.
---
Get a 'mining hat' not to be confused with a 'miner hat' and then mod the light on the helmet to 'bright', it increases visibility dramatically for me in a lot of places where the pipboy light wont help much.
---
Hmm send me the deets I'll see if it wor... er is broken on ps4 üòÄ
---
What length of recording are you seeking for an audition sample? And do you have a cut-off for submissions? It's likely I won't have a chance until this weekend (12/7 or 12/8) to record.
---
Or when it skips along the countryside for a mile or 2 with its helium inflated body lol
---
Really? I've seen people that seem to have marsupial the lobby before the match jumping really high?
---
They are going to be a drop from the Christmas event.
---
That's what making me want to. Im just trying to see how minimal. I mean at the state I currently am in pve im pretty good. I can sweep through west tek in like 10 minutes with my lever action. so thats all that matters to me. If i had a back up id be doing it in even shorter time.
---
But what about when you kill a horde of enemies...
---
Sounds like a fun tactic lol
---
Hey I was just thinking douse anybody buy mini nukes and missiles/do you want to buy any mini nukes I have 6 and missiles I have 22 or anybody on PS4 for that matter
---
Another side note to this, if they ever add ammo scrapping to the game, any relevant type of ammo should scrap into gunpowder and steel.
---
Cant say about bear arm but meathook for sure double dips
---
Me neither I just assumed. But i wouldnt doubt it.
---
If a lot of players bought it, that's exactly where it should be... If people buy something, that's showing that they want it. People don't like the truth of the matter, but it doesn't make it any less true. There are a lot of people that hate it, and a lot of people that bought it. We voted with our dollars. It was massively successful, hence the ranger armors everywhere. So, we Democratically decided, yes, we like purchasing content for the game. Everyone getting everything for free all the time sounds suspiciously like communist propaganda. Have you been spending too much time in Mama Dolces?
---
I would be more then happy with just a common box at this point I always get what I need on the wrong character.
---
I don't use any mutations or chems, except Grape Mentats when selling. I do use XP food, but that's it.
---
Definitely!!
---
Frog legs is a perk card you can unlock. Other than that they are random finds.
---
If it was useless to them then they didn‚Äôt have to take it, I could have put it in a vendor for free for a player that needed it. Some of it they even bought when I accidentally set it at a couple caps a piece. 
---
But I suppose this is why we need in game text chat so players can actually send a message across. At the time I only had 400ish 45 which I can use all at once on a violent night.
---
For real? That's awesome. Where did you get that info from?
---
Scrap all weapons and armor you find. You'll unlock mods for them, it's definitely worth doing early on as there's sooo many to unlock!
---
Don't listen to folk saying sell all weapons you find. Don't do that, there's plenty of other things to sell. Scrapping (Especially once you unlock/upgrade Scrapper Perk Card) will give you new mods and plenty scrap for crafting things.
---
First time here huh?
---
I think I gained a couple of levels or so, but I didn't keep track of exact XP gains. 
---
I was at level +190 with 38 points of INT, so I was scoring next to the 180% of the basic XP for crafted piece. 
---
I didn't sleep or used anything that makes % of gained XP to go up. I was only interested in the brute INT value.
---
Around 3K pieces were crafted (lowest lvl arms, light when possible) and scraped.
---
Ahh that must be it thanks man.
---
I rarely use chems. Every once in a while ill use buffout and alcohol
---
Of course the game would be fun when there‚Äôs still stuff to do. Also, FO76 isn‚Äôt an MMO.
---
I have a nearly identical version.  It wrecks enemies.  Great buy!
---
The prosnap camera shows where they are. It‚Äôs a good workaround when you‚Äôre running from ticks or rats and lose your place where you killed the legendary.
---
God damn it, Marley, you‚Äôre making it hard to be a dick when you‚Äôre so verbose and likeable.  Stop being so eloquent and civil.
---
Really? How? Just pull it out and scan and it shows where the body/meat pile is?
---
Far from it
---
Id be willing to help out when i can but my schedule sucks due to work
---
Thanks I‚Äôll check that out
---
This would be such a huge QoL. I've just leveled up my 4th alt character, and not having access to all the mods from my other characters is not just a pain, but having to get them all again I find prohibitively expensive, especially the rarer ones. Not only that, I think it makes the purveyor restricted to the one character you have the most recipes unlocked on - like, I have the fixer on one character only, I'd be losing out going for guns on any other character.
---
Yep! It‚Äôs says what‚Äôs in view in the upper right corner. Gotta get it in center view then walk towards that direction. Might disappear and reappear in the list a couple of times but it will take your right to it. Some distance limitations but works well. Used it two days ago.
---
If you are happy, then a good buy :)
---
Definitely get the gunfu perk - it's awesome
---
Maybe they could make it something you could toggle on and off like quests in the data section of the pip boy.
---
Thanks I‚Äôm def going to check that out!
---
Back in my day we only had 400 pounds in the stash

So who are the Israeli diamond mine owners? Please state their names and headquarters, I wish to be educated.

Morning run: 9am QLD (Australia) time 
---
Night run: 8pm QLD (Australia) time 
---
Let me know if those times work for you, if not then I can just send you a message every now and then and see if you are free.
---
Ive seen this subject post at least 10x on here. Bethesda doesn't care. If they did they wouldn't charge 20$ for liberty prime skin and fix shit like this. Plain and simple. Obviously it is your first time here
---
Wait so my friends are all locked in the vault?
---
5 freed up points in luck and being able to use rad x at full strength should be enough to not use mutations.
---
I think weapons and armour used to have a similar drop rate but they cut back on armour because it disrupted the core loop a bit much.
---
THISSSSSSSSSSS!!!!! Or any enemy in general
---
Nope
---
They don‚Äôt ban you when you report bugs. It happened once and he reported it- zero chance he is getting banned. Stop spreading misinformation.
---
Id be down if it's doesn't work with the other guy :) CET time here so it should work.. will be on tomorrow
---
Sure whatever you say! I think you have better things to do than criticize my post. But maybe I‚Äôm wrong. Have a good day.
---
Aye Rad Ant Lager is the shit!!
---
Will do!
---
I'm intrigued! Where is that?
---
I found a little den in the mountain range just by Lake Eloise, just north-west of the scorchbeast rift there. I happened to be along at night and caught a glow illuminating a small cave entrance.
---
Sure enough there was a little passage to a small cave, with camp gear etc for one and a boarded up vision slot with a pipe rifle overlooking the rift.
---
Just little vignette's that add to the story, and you'll never know who or why it was there.
---
Im üá∫üá∏ eastern time üôÅ i may be able to help with your morning runs? Ive also only done it twice lol so idk what washout and ect is
---
Try move it away from the wall and put it somewhere in the middle. If it is like the crafting stations, might be glitching out if too close to wall or object ..
---
Good argument as well
---

Don‚Äôt listen to idiots- make the report.
---
It does!! I like it already.
---
It's called the feral slide.
---
Or like my most recent scorched earth encounter, 40 scrip if no legendary appears on the sbq. Dont say i didnt tag her with my last 150 .45s including the critcal hits!
---
Psn sneazel
---
Give it a try next time a low level is being an ass, but when using them as bait dont be too good against whoever ur using them as bait to fight cause if u drop someone 10+ times and dont go down once then they get too scurred for friendly 1v1 haha
---
Check where the legendary spawned sometimes you'll find the loot there
---
Yea I‚Äôve seen that bug, sometimes it‚Äôs hard though if you don‚Äôt know where they spawned.
---
I've now done 100s on both.  No difference in rewards as far as I can tell.  No server crashes on private yet, so I'll probably stick with that.
---
That's a great idea every time I'm on I check out the best vendors on the map. Then I end up seeing some incredible camps and half the time I just want to say how impressed I am with their build and just give them a gift to be like hey man keep up the good work.
---
I agree it's amount, maybe have the legendaries produce a tombstone when they die. That would be cool. So many times I've got burned losing loot because it disappears
---
Yea me too, it‚Äôs especially frustrating when they are three stars
---
I thought the same thing, but being as I'm in Japan I searched the Japanese netiverse and found it: [link](https://togetter.com/li/1438515)
---
And ... it's totally legit. The official producer account saw the photo online, asked to talk about participating in the show, and the poster replied "dude, no, this is a screenshot from a game."
---
I member.
---
Just hold alt for 5 seconds, then whilst still holding alt, hold f4, for 3 seconds. This brings up a "developer" menu. and you can spawn a nuke in a random location, every 30 minutes.
---
Either that, or have the ability to cleared the marked dead enemies, or have it auto clear after a couple of minutes once you‚Äôve been out of combat for however long
---
Haha then it is definitely your first time here
---
Head on over to the filthy casual sub. Great to get your daily dose of good vibes and pure enjoyment.
---
A lot of games will mail you loot when you leave it behind. After 10 or 15 mon it can throw up a notification and ask if you want the left behind caps ammo and legendaries
---
We‚Äôve been asking for this for a while, maybe using the check in desk at the Whitesprings to access your safe
---
Of course, as a result of playing the game during a year, in a normal way (some looting, some quests, some maps, some chests‚Ä¶) I got 70%-80% of the armor mods. But I wanted to force the 100%, so I had to do this.
---
In addition, my character usually has 1 INT. Bad for getting mods. So, at one point, it's better to focus on this task, and to move INT from 1 to 38 with an UNY/I set armor set + buffs.
---
You happen to have a screencap or a way to find that?  I'd love to check it out.
---
&gt; Would I think it's expensive? If they use dollars over there than yes.
---
Uh, yes, Zimbabwe uses the Zimbabwean dollar.
---
One Zimbabwean dollar is not the same as one US dollar.
---
&gt; The game in USD is $39.99 and here $59.99
---
CAD 59.99 is USD 45.47, so you're talking about a 13% difference.  Is this before or after tax?
---
Weird, I see legendaries in the exchange machines all the time, I bought a TSE handmade in there once. Must've belonged to some overencumbered tryhard, I tell you what
---
This is not okay.
---
Why is this a thing?
---
This is not fun gameplay.
---
Ahhh the fella I did a trade with was the one person I have seen with a base there. I'll join him next time and spoil the spot. Just gotta make sure you're not on my system lol
---
relative strength index? i dont understand
---
If it's name is red, it wants you dead
---
if it's name is yellow, its a nice fellow
---
if it's name is white, then you can guess its all right. ^(mostly)
---
If the price is a lot of money to you, then don't get it.  It was really worth it to me, and is a huge improvement (the game finally feels more like fallout).  At 16 and with no easy way to replace it, hold onto your money.  Though, my 16 year old self would've probably to me to go f**k yourself old man üòâ.
---
So here's my Sweepstakes question- Are you currently wearing any standard armor/underarmor that grants weight reduction, bonus strength/carry weight, or any combination of the above?  Because it all goes away when you enter Power Armor, and that might be causing the discrepancy.
---
Once you marsupial you can't go back.  I am leveling up an alt it is killing me not having it.
---
They're there on PC.  People are willing to spend a third of their camp budget on racist crap, painstakingly spelling out messages with tiny metal letters or neon signs.  Although I can't imagine those asshats doing anything more creative or interesting with their budgets anyway.
---
Only just seen this, blaaah! Haha. Nice.
---
I was in the 70s before I started with my first gateway mutation.  Game is completely playable without mutations.
---
It's weird.  You're complaining that early players got nothing special, and about half the posts below are whining about how they didn't get stuff because they got on board too late.
---
I like F76. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I have revieved several good weapons, I don't think it's RNG is any worse than farming legendaries the old fashioned way.
---
Maybe u gotta scroll though a individual table
---
Yes!  This!  That would be excellent.  Seems like it wouldn't sop up too much server load, if camps were limited to one or two.  I don't know if there is infrastructure in place to edit it in CAMP mode (re: weapons renaming).  Seems like a natural to integrate it with a camp terminal, just like light box colors and such.  You'd have to lock down the terminal, though, as it'd be instantly overwritten by every passerby.
---
Tried it and I couldn't find it.
---
It's under "Displays". And it's very good!
---
Ty for help!
---
Mind if I send a request your way? I just started playing about a week ago, lvl 16, would like people to play/chill with as I don't know what I'm doing yet
---
Evidence tells us otherwise.
---
Huge difference between gholes and super mutants
---
oh dear. and just think, school holidays start soon. imagine the level of 'creative' C.A.M.P
---
It would be cool if whenever we killed a legendary, the legendary item was automatically looted
---
I wish they add a search function
---
Most of the mods are useless. No one has to do this to play the game. OP and I are just weirdo completionists.
---
Don't risk your account for nothing, OP. It's just a bunch of extra gear, enjoy it!
---
Nah you can‚Äôt put anything on it, it‚Äôs a normal table
---
Show us your evidence.
---
The guy is banned. That's the evidence.
---
Evidence isn‚Äôt your word- show us.
---
So he isn't banned?
---
yea, one shows more hospitality with the massive amount of bullet they give you.
---
You said you had evidence- so show it? I‚Äôm waiting.
---
I feel the same as you, except I finally had enough. I even joined first to check it out and was so unimpressed I couldn‚Äôt play anymore. However the game isn‚Äôt bad, it‚Äôs the treatment of us. The first. The dedicated fallout fan that dropped the pre- order money before they were even accepting it. Wanted to help the company by getting them revenue. But they half asses it, then instead of owning it and trying to remedy it‚Äôs been kinda one face slap after another. I‚Äôve lost too many of my legendary weapons to even go into. Just disappeared right out of my inventory. The first time it was one that you get from survival tasks. It was a game changer weapon and I figured it was linked to the fact that they issued it after the tasks were complete. It musta happened to a lot of people because they redid that weapon so we could reacquire them. But my ghoul slayer sledge hammer was unforgivable. It was the first good legendary and I had it since the beta. I almost cried. Thought maybe I dropped it, but I didn‚Äôt. Sorry I had to vent this out. I just think before they started charging people for stuff monthly on top of paying for PlayStation plus they could‚Äôve figured something out for the people that suffered through a lot of the glitches and kept playing. At one point I was stuck in power armor for like 2 weeks without the benefit of the armor. That was horrid but I kept on playing. It was worth the money, but I sure hope they‚Äôre making a fallout6 single player for folks like me that wanna zone people out and submerse myself into a game without all the hassle.
---
Or just make corpses with loot on them glow... problem solved.
---
There is an amazing blue screen filter
---
My bad, I mis-read the title. I meant the display case thing.
---
What guy? All I am asking is for you to show me this evidence you claim to have. It shouldn‚Äôt be that hard. I mean I posted the company stating they do not ban for one time glitches without even being asked. 
---
So once again- let‚Äôs see your evidence?
---
Good tip!  Definitely a good idea if you have standard messages that you reuse.  
---
I'd also suggest doing your lettering on an easily-removable temporary surface, like the flat back of a book shelf.  Those tiny letters have the bad habit of embedding themselves invisibly inside complex surfaces or otherwise becoming untouchable when moved.  At least if that happens with a book shelf, you can delete/store the shelf without having to tear down half your house to find that errant "S" or "E". 
---
Also better to delete/store those small letters, then re-place them, as opposed to trying to move them once they're placed.  That's usually when I see them do something weird that requires me to tear down a wall to remove them.
---
1st made this a little bit easier...my highest character makes or get materials as needed for the other 2, in return they hold extra weapons and weight. I just feel sorry for that body at vault 76, ive transfered soooo many things ‚Äúthrough‚Äù him!
---
Chameleon is not necessary my friend.  And you want better armor than weightless for melee.  Chameleon really shines on snipers.  Just need 1 x escape artist and 3 x sneak and you can pretty much sneak up on anything.  Just avoid rocket attachments to melee weapons.  Messes with stealth for some reason.  Sucks cause sneak attacks with a supersledge? Yes please.
---
Mainly marsupial
---
Take off your power armour.
---
I'm up for this! I can help with PA services, Ammo, crippling enemies and general banter. L184, Rifle/Shotgun build. GT JaggersLips13
---
The materials are not the problem for me, but rather the plans...
---
Mine is not showing up under displays either. It's just the display case that is there for me and no arrow to scroll over
---
&gt;Yes, just like most every other game
---
Why are you being downvotingüòÇ
---
*The* guy.
---
Well since one doesnt use guns
---
So you really don‚Äôt have anything do you?
---
No need to be salty, come on.
---
So you don't know how this whole controversy started, and yet you defend Bethesda without knowing what they've done? Shame on you, brother.
---
Only been asking multiple times for this evidence you claim to have.. yet you don‚Äôt seem to be able to produce anything but ‚Äúthe guy is banned‚Äù
---
Oh god yes.
---
I‚Äôve come from Xbox to pc and I‚Äôm very much missing the red and white shag carpets and the vault tec Lino
---
ya camp plans are harder, weapons or clothing i just have the one who knows them craft for the other.
---
He is banned, man. It'd a tragedy.
---
I guess I'm not allowed to talk about people having fun lol
---
I love this game so I had absolutely no doubts with the sub, I can pay monthly and can afford it. But, can cancel at any time. The benefits are pretty good, mainly not worrying about hoarding scrap. Private World's are handy for many reasons too. If you don't have the cash though I'd wait till they do a free trail or something similar. Try it out first for a month. This is one of the best games ever released. In my opinion of course. ;)
---
I dont bother with it anymore. It has been empty for me for anout 3 months now.
---
Hehehe I thought "PSA it takes 12,467 steps to walk from top left to the bottom right of the map, just in case anyone finds that useful" xD
---
having a log of what sells at what price would really help fine tune our vendors
---
I meant the display case, sorry, I misread your post. I'll delete mine to solve misinformation.
---
Which is still awesome xD
---
This made me lol
---

---
Being able to run the morning raids will actually help us a lot as it's the run we struggle to fill the most. 
---
If you go to your weekly atom challenges screen it will say what mission is on this week ie dead in the water, meltdown or washout. Knowing what mission is running helps a lot with what prep you will need to do and what chems to bring. We have also done the raids heaps of times so if you have any questions then ask away.
---
We bring about 100 stimpaks each, 30 to 50 radaway depending on the mission, rad shield works well and insect repellent is a must.
---
In a nutshell; 
---
Dead in the water is lots of shooting and no to a tiny amount of rads til the end boss fight and then there is a lot of rads and lots of shooting. This is the easiest mission and the most fun. 
---
Meltdown is lots of rads, kind of tedious (which is why we only do it once a day) and lots of shooting at the end.
---
Washout is little rads, bug central and more a protect, hunt and gather mission with a very easy finish. 
---
My GT is Gravebook653309. Add me as a friend and then if you could send me an Xbox message so I can link your GT to the raids. You can also message me any questions thru Xbox as well.
---
Sorry for the info dump, I prefer my team mates know what they are getting themselves into rather than just throw them into the deep end. 
---
Let me know if I can put you down for tomorrow morning's run.
---
Lol yes there is.  Theres a sound check on ps and you can adjust your vocal levels.
---
Green
---
u/uwutranslator wanting to see if bots are banned on this sub
---
Wait.i forgot.this is.76 we cant have fun its nkt allowedüòÇü§°
---
What kind of build do you run with 1 int?  I‚Äôm genuinely curious.  It has to be something high health that has a lot of repair kits from events and doesn‚Äôt use shotguns or high ROF energy weapons.  Those things have the durability of antique porcelain.  I use an explosive pump shotgun to kneecap enemies in V94, and it still breaks ridiculously fast with 3 gunsmith.
---
I think newer players, the ones that don‚Äôt have all the plans they like, would benefit greatly by supplementing their armor scrapping with events and maps.  It‚Äôll save a lot of work in the long run.
---
I specifically started funneling maps to one character, just to make unearthing them more efficient.  The byproduct was a huge influx of plans of all kinds, including stuff I didn‚Äôt know I needed or wanted.  I‚Äôm just missing an arm or leg for a couple power armor sets, I can build most from scratch now, plus some stuff I probably should have sold instead of read, like the puncturing pole hook and deathclaw gauntlet plans.
---
I think I‚Äôm angling towards the fact that a lot of players seem to sell maps rather than dig up the treasure, losing out on good finds that could save hours of resource acquisition and time spent at crafting benches.  
---
If I see players selling maps for less than 50 caps, I buy everything they have.  About the beginning of November I was sitting on a couple dozen Savage Divide #7 and #1, because I have to specifically choose to go down there for some digs, and walked away with a couple new weapon mod plans, at a point where I know pretty much everything.  One was for a laser rifle scope, oddly enough.  I also got an extra spear and dense metal plan that promptly sold for 7676 caps each in my own vending machine.
---
No, lol.
---
I've sent so many accidental team invites or friend requests because of this haha
---
I would suggest AAE over TSE.  TSE breaks really fast and is not particularly accurate at any distance for the 2nd bullet.
---
You got to have at least 1 melee character to complete the set üòÅ
---
Literally dont bother with defending, just retake after
---
I'm interested in this also. It seems Private World's don't drop rare, or semi rare plans in the usual places. Does it affect rewards and event rewards? I've not tested this yet.
---
Wait, do slim Jim‚Äôs and porn count?
---
All the melee issues. Damage lag, damage numbers but no actual damage, black screen of death when VATSing flying enemies. It's pathetic that this has gone on this long.
---
If you log off wearing the Excavator PA, when you log back in, you gain 100 extra carry weight. As soon as you exit, then re-enter your armor you'll lose it.
---
I want military paint for Pewdiepie
---
Never will i stoop that low
---
Just pop it near a train station, I like mine down in Watoga. Everything is a couple steps away. Tinker bench in the station and fissure prime a short jog away.
---
Yup, they're fixing in the next patch.
---
I may try that instead. Ill be close quarters with it but i may look for aae instead so i can simply seitch recievers as i please.
---
Just stand next to a yellow barrel.
---
Hopefully the skinny radiation noodles don't learn how
---
You can also radiate yourself to get one. But try not to die and be sure to have a few rada ways. The mutation won't go away by radaway
---
Brains are to bad off to learn
