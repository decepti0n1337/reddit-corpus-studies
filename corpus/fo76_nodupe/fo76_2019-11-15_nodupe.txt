Doubt it. Not much to nerf. Maybe the regen in pa.

"Over penetration... the title sounds so wrong"

I love double xp.. perfect time to start a new toon

Or Bethesda sucks at programming. I don’t know maybe it’s the random shit your saying...
---
There should be an expansion that makes all the boarded up buildings possible to break into with an axe. Some of the buildings should be filled with hostiles, radiation, or traps though.
---
...
---
Why wouldn’t I buy it, I wanted private server. 
---

---
They said last year, before the game was released, that private servers would have a subscription. 
---
The Atoms, Junk Box, and Tent are just bonuses on something I already expected to pay
---
The scrapper perk (intelligence) helped farm SCRAP
---
&gt; To start off there are people who seem to be genuinely enjoying the game, but this seems to be in-spite of the game not because of it.
---
What?  what does that even *mean*?
---
&gt; These bugs range from annoying to game breaking.
---
In many peoples experience the bugs range from amusing to slightly annoying.
---
... I got bored at this point.
---
Your summary seems heavily weighted towards the PC experience.
---
800h/lvl 190...  me too
---
Terrible point. Holy shit what a terrible point. You couldn't be more wrong. 
---
All illegal and exploitative loot box practices effect the consumer. Epic and other exclusives effect the consumer. 
---
But if the humans doing the work are devastated it's ok. All hail the consumer and support low wages and anxiety inducing labor practices!
---
Go tug on your balls you tit fucker
---
So im assuming they didnt add anything into the atom shop for the anniversary? like they did for the other anniversary of the day the bombs fell? :( :( im sad
---
You are right.
---
Ur welcome,  glad we could make ur day brighter, if it helps i bought a years subscription. By the way it is amazing, solo play, invite friends, stable server, never ending stash, pretty handy tent to save on fast travel and not to mention ranger outfit and 1650 atoms per month. All joking aside i have been going in and out of private and public and there is a huge difference,  instead of being mad u should look for a group that u can join on a private server u would be surprised. Sorry if this angers u just kidding around with u.
---
It's realtime. There is a issue with commando and ffr. If the first bullet doesn't hit the rest won't either. Ffr on fast guns like the rail rifle also count all 10 shots as crits in vats. I like to use it on rifleman though (semi). Hit space when your crit meter is full to use it.
---
Instigating crit right? That was a nice gun.
---
Energy weapons have been buffed over the last year
---
Bethesda isn't taking too much shit. The other publishers need to take shit too.
---
Go tug on your balls you tit fucker. Read a fucking book and try to understand reality.
---
I quit because of this bug.
---
One of the biggest issues of this game is the wallbreaches in NW!!!! people are trash if they resort to using them
---
I used to fall asleep at release lol
---
Sameee, there's a radroach on the top floor of the house at the lighthouse and sometimes I can vats it for 95% for half a second. I can kill it just standing outside on the ground and spam vats and pull the trigger until one of the vats shots hits it by passing the wall entirely.
---
I didn't buy it and don't plan to but just out of curiosity, how is the game worse?  I'm not trying to be combative, just honestly curious.
---
&gt; Players seemed frustrated that the "cosmetic only" promise was broken so quickly,
---
I'm a player, I couln't give a fuck about that.
---
&gt; No one complained about *[...]* the rate of legendary drops
---
What the fuck?  THat's like the #2 or #3 whine.
---
A corporatocracy that stifles capitalism, we’d have more indies and choices in capitalism.
---
I've been rocking NW, experimenting with different builds between my 2 (soon to be 3) NW characters, and trying out different strategies. At the end of each day, I switch to Adventure to get the caps, Scrip, and Atoms, then log off.
---
I am not butthurt. I have never played NW, nor will I ever.
---
Why should I care if the mode is available, or why should anyone ask the question, outside the shower, while being sober?
---
It does not detract from the series or from FO76.
---
Maybe it's on you to start using KY if you think you need to start a discussion w/o any arguments?
---
Lol
---
Teleport through walls using melee and vats on an enemy. The range is surprisingly far. Same as in 4 I think, with... Blitz? Whatever let you do that from farther.
---
This week I set myself the goal of obtaining a Responders Fireman helmet.  I also set out to do campfire tails more often and get the high capacity backpack.
---
How? How is only Bethesda anti-consumer? Because they are offering an optional premium pass? What about nearly every single game on the market with a season pass that if you do not get you cannot play the majority of the maps/modes on? How is tax evasion not anti-consumer?
---
Since I never saw where you asked for "feedback" and don't know who you are...
---
Point 1) they are creating their own content from the sand box and enjoying the game despite the bugs, limited end game content and exploits. 
---
2)there are many game breaking bugs. One example The Raid armor which takes a dozen hours or so to grind causes the game to lag and crash when used. 
---
3) NW being broken is the only platform specific info.
---
Don't forget the completely empty tree that no one can actually acquire!
---
If you're posting shit like this to r/FO76 it's because you're a cunt, or...
---
Or nothing.
---
You don't realize it yet but F1st ensures that this game will continue to operate for years to come like ESO. People who hate the game would prefer it shut down, not allow it to improve. Overall 1st is a good thing.
---
Regardless of complaints, Zenimax will not shut down a cashcow. If the game didn't make any money AND had so much controversy then it would definitely be shut down. If the atom shop wasn't cutting it then they're allowed to find different forms of revenue.
---
 You don't see any f2p games chugging along like F76 does, do you? They would be dead on arrival if they opened like F76 did. They'd definitely be dead if they continuously was attacked like F76 gets attacked online
---
I constantly have to remind myself to check who OP is for announcement posts like this. As the saying goes, don’t shoot the messenger, especially when they are one of us.
---
OP should have your proper upvote now, at least from me.
---
That's because it's only the chance that the bullet is launched in the correct trajectory according to an infinitely thin line ray check towards a part of the enemy mesh.  The actual projectile is thicker and can be obstructed by all manner of garbage in the path, or sometimes the enemy mesh itself (ie, attempting a head shot on something where the rest of the enemy mesh is blocking the head).  In my experience, you'll often miss shots that veer near any sort of obstruction.  That happens rather often even when you're not using VATs.
---
To make matters worse, the VATs chance seems to be calculated on the client.  On the server, the positions of objects can be a little different, particularly when something is moving.  The server's projectile calculation will be authoritative.
---
In this house we praise Mothman
---
I'm sure there will be some.  At the very least, they'll probably bring back all the stuff they had last year.  You forgot the incredibly creepy animatronic Santa and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Radstag.
---
Many players were frustrated that an explicit promise was not kept. I’m glad that didn’t bother you. 
---
I can’t recall the drop rate coming up in my posts.
---
I didn't buy those last year. Lol
---
&gt; One of 76’s many ~~problems~~ advantages  is that it does a lot of things...
---
Selling items message me for info
---
Gauss rifle never hits anything on the first shot in vats for me.  Bug
---
But my guy, they're a AAA company with SEVERAL different projects. Every game they have has to be bringing in money, they don't want to funnel funds into something operating at a loss. Their IPs have to be self sufficient
---
Tweaked it a little. Tell me what you think. You'd want an piece of lifesaving armor. Could probably get higher loosing some of the already dangerously low survivability for stealth crit boosts I think but Im still looking for a BE revolver so im not sure if you can silence them. I'd probably go for a Bloody double crits pipe bolt action for the max damage stealth sniper
---
I pay no attention to the challenges.. I dont even know what most of them are until after I get it
---
You want to bitch about bitching or do you want to bitch about something else?
---
Where did you get this "player feed back"?
---
You on PC? I got a spare BE pipe revolver
---
I'm a researcher for a living, so I could speak to various details about the biased  population sample and blahblahblah until your eyes glazed over from boredom.  
---
But regardless of the topic, many people form their own opinion and do not attempt to do any kind of research whatsoever about how their experience and perceptions compare to the experience of others. I believe that attempts to do that are valuable both for the individual person &amp; the larger community. The only way people get better at research (or anything else in life) is by attempting to do it, which often involves doing things "imperfectly".   
---
It would be difficult to access a truly representative population of current 76 players without working with Bethesda directly. Typically that would also require significantly more funding than the average random person would have available, cuz the group of people who are both willing &amp; able to donate their time and energy to giving feedback for free is already a limited group.   
---
If you did want to do this in more of a "research way", that would often involve attempting to find out the demographics of the people who are contributing feedback and then looking for patterns. For example, the 6 year old boy who once joined my team had fairly different thoughts on the game than another teammate who was a 67 year old grandmother. ;) A few other examples of potential criteria: economic situation, gender, orientation, play style, overall gaming experience, platform, prior familiarity with fallout and/or bethesda games, etc.  
---
I do agree with code\_gate that even on a much smaller level, some of the other 76-related forums online (whether other subs, FB groups, bethesda forums, etc.) might reach a different group of gamers &amp; thus result in somewhat different feedback.
---
gingerbread walls and snowy roofs please! lol
---
How am I saying random shit, what?
---
What
---
Swimming.
---
And those of us who've never interacted with a "trader" since we started playing?   We're invisible?
---
I love the game and still play since the start, but will never support Bethesdas bad decisions, plus I don't like getting walked all over..
---
Thank you 🙏
---
176, 90, 75,50 rifle builds. 65 bloodied
---
This is an interesting take. I've never been one for self-interest based ethics (up yours Ayn Rand!) so not acting against harmful things always seems more dismissive than anything to me so I guess I gloss over them. Hence why one of the criteria I bring up is harm done to people.
---
But I'd also argue that abuse of employees is ultimately anti-consumer. Anthem was a mess of nothing and a bad product because no one on the development staff knew what the hell were doing and could get fired at any given time. If the people making games are doing so under bad conditions the product, and by extent the consumer and industry suffer too.
---
What posts?
---
Real Vaultdwellers don't need Fats, cats.
---
Challenges are there to increase player engagement. To incentivize you to log in every day. I have no need for them either.
---
Achievements can be useful when they inform a player of a mechanic or playstyle they may not know about.
---
As a hoarder and farmer of things that are cheap and sell fast it helps me a ton to have points in strength to carry more and all my gear has item weight reduction. A couple pieces of fdc reduction and you can carry enough to survive for a long time on the road.
---
Yes true fact
---
wait people play this dumpster fire?
---
2. A level 70 ish unarmed guy who goes through multiple identities every set levels, and a level 7 vault girl who two hands the bigger melee weapons
---
It's time for something else to be OP. My hope is berserkers so it truely will be a glass cannon.
---
Damage resistance isnt capped. Top end PvPers arent wearing full sets of sentinel assassin or bolstering heavy leather because they're just so much affordable or easier to find than other armors. Its so they can eat a full clip from a Qffr tesla.
---
Omg that would be so awesome
---
The problem is they are all the same, some are straight forward and upfront about how they are going to pull money from wallets/purses...others have a bait and switch like Beth over here...I know I know, some will argue certain promises were or were not made and that's fine, you have your stance and I have mine...we all hear or read things differently. There is no lesser of the evils....its all evil.
---
Yes to the snowy roofs! And snowy ground!
---
I do it for the atoms.
---
Never before have I been so sad to be playing on Xbox haha
---
A natural byproduct of capitalism in the real world.
---
Added you
---
Unfortunately I agree, though as someone who has been labelled a "shill", I might restate it:... you should come to the game with altered expectations for anything Beth makes. Lol
---
Honestly at this point I'll take Bethesda hate being scaled down or (preferably) everyone else hate getting scaled up. Either, or.
---
Killing those damn mutants in his name, rest in peace LeShire5K.
---
1. Enjoying the game despite the bugs means enjoying the game despite the bugs, not enjoying the game despite the game. 
---
2. how does that "break the game?"  Yes, it makes some play objectives sub-optimal, but it doesn't break the game.
---
3. Really?  You're ignoring the whole map76 thing?
---
Dude a two paragraph essay with 2 pictures about a new weapon they are adding would be fine
---
Ya hopefully I will find some folks early on to craft me pocket gear. So cheap for them but it can add a nice chunk of carry weight to a level 5.
---
Any new items people are looking for? I assume screws and ballistic fiber are still always in demand? I am sure I will learn looking at other peoples shops and stocking similar stuff I have in surplus.
---
Have they added any new perks since launch worth searching for?
---
Totally agree. Honestly the data could only really speak for the users of this sub.
---
Hey my one year keychain and certificates for my current job came 2 weeks before my second anniversary.
---
It was good to see them address the Halloween problem, for sure. 
---
It's just that neither of the things you mention are celebrating Reclamation Day. And that's the really baffling part of the ITV for me. :P
---
I mean the 250 DR bug is still there.
---
Interesting people keep just saying "RNG bro you're just unlucky!" Noooo way am I that unlucky along with the hundreds of people saying they're seeing this too
---
Totally thought this would be a hate post on how much you think the game is lacking. Way to spread some love :)
---
That about sums it up. Well done. Now if only they have a shut about their fans or this franchise beyond the simple "new fallout=easy money" equation.
---
Nothing to do with RNG, I remember having this situation.
---
Naw.
---
(My standard answer to ever one of these posts)
---
Yes the game only lets you know if people on your friends twist are online.
---
Ha.
---
Not agreeing or disagreeing but if u came up with these comparisons gj
---
What's your username ?  I didn't find any new friend request.
---
I find they can give you some fun long term goals to work towards as long as you don't let them become your sole motivation to play. They can also just be a good way to help track something you would want to do anyways. I might just want to collect all the widgets in a game to say I've done it, the achievement just gives me built in tracking and a nice fanfare for doing what I already wanted to do.
---
Really sorry about your loss
---
Kowtowing to dictatorships doesn't get a mention?
---
The bugs are a part of the game, so is the limited end game content. 
---
When the game crashes or lags for minutes on end you can’t play it. 
---
I did not mention that controversy in my original post.
---
&gt;  But something you'll notice with a lot of these that you've listed is that they aren't anti-consumer. 
---
The consumer is god, fuck the workers.
---
&gt;So we get nothing for the 1 year anniversary? Are we a joke to you?
---
Yes, and yes.
---
If I want to run around as Arnold Schwarzenegger I wanna be Soo buff it looks like my muscles have morphed into my power armor. I do think we need a few more options. And honestly the only real issue would be ensuring all the armors and outfits fit the character model. So yes bring on the weird. And give us a randomization option to go all ham with whatever abomination it gives us.
---
I've clapped people lvl 300+ with my lower lvl character and AA handmade, and a buddy of mine runs around doing it with a lvl 8 charater he has lol. No shame in that. With the DPS weapons and anti-armor effects people are running you're going to want every bit of health you can. Damage output is always more important that how tank you can be, dead enemies dont deal damage. But if YOU are the dead guy you wont be doing any damage either. How fast PvP drops one person, you're just trying to add 2-3 seconds of staying alive long enough to take them out first from my experience
---
Nope.
---
Big business is bad yes.
---
What region/time zone are you in?
---
Honestly I just want a "Mark as scrap" option. Then I can mark anything as scrapable for the auto scrap.
---
I feel like this is a 'capitalism' thing at the end of the day, not a gaming thing. And I'm not saying that as an anti-capitalist. 
---
One thing I learned here though: Obsidian has apparently done no wrong, so maybe that's part of the reason Bethesda gets such a bad rep. They're following in the footsteps of a saintly and renowned studio. 
---
(also, CDPR isn't on this list which seems weird because weren't they getting in trouble for workplace labour problems in Poland? Am I misremembering? Are they getting a pass because so many of us are hyped for Cyberpunk? :p)
---
&gt; Fallout 76 is garbage.
---
No, it's not.  It's a buggy, fun game.
---
No. Its still pretty much the same game. The exciting thing will be going thru your inventory and seeing if you have any legacy weapons or sought after ones.
---
im stoked for 2xXP.. gonna grind a metric shit ton of levels
---
a lot of bugs were fixed, but some new ones introduced and some old ones remain.  all that said it's a lot better than launch imo with a lot more to do.
---
For the Atoms, also if it is listed as a challenge then I have been slapped in the face with the glove, I almost have to do them, lol. Seriously though, if you play with a team, keep a few outfits and a camera most of them are not challenging in any way.
---
That's alot of memberberries.
---
No no just follow the cave entrance outward and head south east towards Tanagra town
---
anything that adds "hip fire accuracy" or has the name "aligned" in it will make your weapon more vats efficient.
---
&gt; How is tax evasion not anti-consumer?
---
This actually gets even worse. Those subsidiaries I mentioned? They make it so even if you don't buy a single Rockstar game, you're still supporting them financially. The only way to completely boycott Rockstar in the UK is to commit tax evasion.
---
Let me clarify. He was my brother.  I love the game with all of its flaws and play daily. He didn’t like it but we both knew his time was limited so he played with me anyways.
---
Exploit to stack fountains to make castles or using foundation glitch to place a base where there is no dirt to use. Patched around February.
---
Can you link me to that? I need it the other day and couldnt find it lol.
---
From what I can tell the rule of thumb is anything that lowers the weight of the gun is going to have an impact on the vats cost stocks and silencers included. But Im by no means an expert
---
I would consider adding a bunch of overpriced cosmetics while the game is still buggy and runs like shit pretty anti-consumer.
---
I wouldn't say tax evasion directly affects the consumer.
---
I believe all automatic receivers reduce AP cost by 50%.
---
This is how I think you can get 100% AP cost reduction:
---
Automatic Receiver: -50% (50%)
---
Dot/Circle Sight: -15 (35%)
---
Stabilized Barrel: -15% (20%)
---
Stabilized Stock: -15% (5%)
---
Quick Magazine: -5% (0%)
---
I do not know if true mods reduce AP cost.
---
Why?  The game *already* allows building below the map if you use glitches.
---
&gt; Game engine will not allow it. 
---
Yes it does.
---
Seems like the reason people stopped bloodied pvping was the damage caps. With no one shot kills low life builds don't really make sense.
---
remember when Atari made E.T. ?
---
Don't forget legendary shovels.
---
Goes to show how much they care about their fanbase. Actions speak louder than words.
---
Loot boxes do directly affect the consumer.  It's easy to be outraged at that.  But game devs being overworked and subjected to terrible working conditions don't directly affect the consumer.  It's harder for people to get outraged at something unless it directly affects them.  I'm not saying it isn't bad, I'm just saying it's not surprising that something like that doesn't get as much outrage as something that is directly affecting the consumer's experience like loot boxes.
---
Nah, you want to use a double boiler, on double XP, no brainier.

biggest condolences 💌 sending you peace and light and hope ✨

---
I really can't tell if it's a joke
---
We still have bugged zombies that are laying down attacking you lol 
---
I think your standards are way to high for Bethesda at this point resulting in your high disappointment and frustration. 
---
You’re beating a dead horse.
---
Not a single fuck is given when it comes to 76 and I think that’s been clear for a while now my friend. 
---
Save your energy. 
---
I didn’t even expect anything let alone a double xp event.
---
You're very welcome, It was an absolute pleasure I don't mind telling you.
---
And thank you! For reminding me what great judgement I have, affording me a lifestyle where I can avoid broke or stingy whiners on my virtual private island 👍
---
I'm mostly saying that it's harder for people to get outraged at something unless it's directly affecting them.  I'm not saying any of these things aren't despicable and deserving of backlash.  It's easier for someone to get pissed when the game they're sold is a broken piece of shit and/or there are microtransactions galore than if the devs that worked on it were subjected to glorified slave labor to make it.
---
From what I'm seeing on the wiki some of those mods dont reduce AP cost or at least aren't labeled to. And I am hearing from people the effect doesn't stack but multiplies so you'll end up with about 64% reduced ap cost with all mods and the -25% legendary effect. 
---
Trying to figure it out myself so I may be way wrong on it.
---
"Go tug on your balls you tit fucker"
---
I'm... interested in both these things.
---
You asked what had happened, I gave you an honest answer. If you still need help you might want to visit Bethesda's website for more info.
---
It's literally the only reason I log on anymore. I completed all missions very quickly due to the small amount, then for months it's just been making my own fun with base building etc. I own more end game armor and weapons than I could ever use.
---
Unfortunately the challenges aren't usually very fun. It's usually something grindy or requiring server hopping like (kill a mega sloth in the cranberry bog. Which has a few possible spawn points but you'd need to server hop to find 1).
---
If they made them more often something like kill X amount of enemies at Camden park or Tyler Ferry Fairgrounds with a commie wacker. It takes a little time to do, but takes you to a location, changes your normal gameplay, is interesting or comical, what is needed for the challenge is there so doesn't require server hopping for an hour.
---
Or challenges connect to each other so it doesn't seem like a grind for no reason. Instead of brew 20 alcoholic drinks, make it "make 10 Molotov cocktails", then the 20 atom challenge be "kill 5 Ghouls with Molotov cocktails.
---
&gt; The bugs are a part of the game
---
Deep, man.  Like herpes simplex is part of life.
---
&gt; so is the limited end game content
---
Well, I've only got 900  hours in.  Maybe late I'll run out of "end game" content.
---
&gt; When the game crashes or lags for minutes on end you can’t play it.
---
I've being playing since beta.  I've seen crashes.  Fewer than FO3 for example.  I've never seen "lags for minutes on end".
---
One constant of this game is the different player experiences.  Some have endless crashes, lags, disconnects and server crashes.  Some don't.  Heated fights have broken out between the two groups because nobody will believe the others are telling the truth.
---
#AND YOU SOMEHOW SURVIVE, WHICH LETS BE HONEST IS TOTALLY RIDICULOUS

Well shoot, I'd have to choose between am eyebot and an opossum... honestly the hardest decision of my life

There is no other game that has even this level of detail in a city. But sure, lazy.
---
He'll be remembered brother.

Use Aligned mods and automatic receivers plus fast magazines. I tried different combinations and that is what lowers costs as much as possible.

It's supposed to tell you the item will be destroyed, did you get that dialogue?
---
2xp is sweet dude
---
From being completely unusable to "hey this actually does damage no-... oh it broke"
---
Been there, done that. Lmao
---
So what is an acceptable price? Especially when nearly every other game has microtransactions that could also be argued to being overpriced. 
---
Yes the game still has bugs, as does every other title in recent history. This is evident when nearly everything gets a day 1 patch and patches along the way to fix things. 
---
Also I think your understanding of the tax system may need to be examined more closely. When you skip out on paying taxes on millions of dollar the governements notice and charge others with less power, the consumers. This can be inflation in prices themselves or in taxes on those goods.
---
I remember hearing about CDPR getting in trouble for crunch, but wasn't sure the extent of it. Was there any lawsuits or legal action involved or is it just the usual industry standard bullshit from a more respected developer?
---
I sell them for 420 each ;)
---
Same thing with Vault 52, gonna have to read it if I want, and even 76 to a point is missing lore
---
Are you implying the bugs were introduced from outside sources? As far as experience the graft on mayor is the best example, some didn’t get him in their ear all the time others did. What Is your endgame?
---
Do you know which ones actually effect it though? From what I can tell it's only the receiver, barrel, and sights. Other than that none of the mods effect the ap cost
---
If wastelanders flops, this game will never be able to recover and will just die. They have to get it right, otherwise all the players that dropped the game for the time being will just click uninstall.
---
I'ma guess 30.
---
Can absolutely confirm.
---
Yeah, wonder why all I ever see are stealthboy teslas anymore...? Its the right direction to move, just dont do it ONCE and then do a Right Stuff walk away thinking they solved a problem instead of making a new one.
---
Play as a detective. You're not to be the biggest and baddest but are wondering what happened per building in Appalachia.
---
There’s a house west of vault 76 that has an APC on the road right next to it. It’s right by one of the treasure map locations.
---
Not sure if it’s CAMPable but it’s a low level area
---
Yeah, everyone who is complaining about this Reclaimation Day is forgetting Wastelanders was pushed back. They had to cut a lot of shit over that, we'll probably have something better next Reclaimation Day
---
*insta-closes all warning boxes*
---
No! What warning message?! I also sold off all my favourited weapons and armor! How could *they* let this happen?!
---
Yes I think it's the receiver, barrel, and mag that will reduce the AP cost. And it looks like it's any automatic receiver, aligned barrel, and quick mag are the way to go for reduction. Other mods will either increase the ap cost or not have an effect
---
Can verify that PS4 pops up a warning and states that the item will be deleted if you continue.
---
Let me know if you confirm or refute :)
---
I sure did but you also get a dialogue when an item is favorited so I mistook them. It happens but I believe the game shouldn't just delete shit when dropped because they have a skin on them.
---
I already said goodbye and you couldn't respect that, what makes you think I'd give you something you refuse to give yourself?
---
They do break quickly. I get repair kits from the Queen battle and save them for the energy gun repairs.

Damn this is extremely accurate to what I personally feel about this game. Let's hope somebody at BGS reads this and takes notes though I doubt they will.
---
Uh let me help you out here.
---
Luck effects Vats Crit Meter Fill Rate.  At 15 Luck your crit meter should fill up around 23% per hit.  That's a lot of crits with an automatic weapon.
---
Perception effects Vats Accuracy.
---
However!  The displayed percentage is not always correct, as a matter of fact a glitch with it is that it starts at 100% then runs down to the displayed number. (Unconfirmed but that's my theory)
---
Shooting almost immediately upon entering VATS often times lands a hit even at 25% hit chance and *even* if the enemy has just moved behind cover before the VATS lock breaks.
---
I agree with OP. I also honestly believe that Bethesda didn't have anything planned (or didnt realize it was the one year anniversary) and only gave us double xp and gave a mention of it because we (reddit and or player base) brought it up.
---
Christ are you a bot
---
Cool.... I guess I'll just increase my character's level from 257-260 over a weekend. Just add those perk points to the other 40 of them sitting there waiting with no use whatsoever.
---
They could've atleast given us something nice in the atomic shop this week, instead it's just another icon... Jeepers! So exciting!
---
I truly feel the love and loyalty from Bethesda for supporting the game.
---
I actually had to go check the pop vinyl to see, was hoping it was a misprint because it would’ve been cool but it’s just the vinyl #, each pop has their own
---
I'm an old-timer player too and I really couldn't care less to achievements and challenges on games I don't like, but I do find them extremely handy as a replay-value factor on games I like to play...
---
That's actually written into the lore a little bit "where the fuck are these things coming from we just cleared this place out" type entries in computers and holotapes/notes in Morgantown and the Forest. But the same thing happened in FO4 and 3 anyway
---
Pvp is almost nonexistent
---
VATS with melee weapons has a pretty serious bug right now where your hits don't seem to go through.  You'll lunge, land the hit, get a hit marker with hit damage displayed, but nothing happens to the enemy.
---
I just heard Gandalf voice reading that haha
---
Luckily my fiancé and I put the 100-150 hours into FO4 together so I didn’t have to worry her, but I’m glad you’ve met so many awesome people! I’ve met so many awesome people as well and hope to meet more; seeing how people are so willing to help one another survive out in Appalachia is really amazing sometimes 😊
---
Could American players create a class action lawsuit
---
Well, this is a Fallout 76 Reddit thingy, so, I think praising and hating Bethesda makes sense. 
---
I have other Facebook groups to discuss how Kojima this or how Capcom that and Nintendo and...
---
They couldn't screw in lightbulb even if they tried!
---
This guy was doing it for a while, but I guess lost interest in helping Bethesda.
---
https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCLRzsDHGZ8P7TZc0woC5j1A
---
When does the double xp start?
---
If they let us use modded servers, we'd effectively fix most of the game issues.
---
They've got to wring every last penny from the faithful before they will allow it, sadly
---
My PTSD agrees with you...
---
-95% hit chance, last pokemon vs their last pokemon in the wifi battle arena, uses move, misses, they attack, I faint, rage, throw DS across the park, freak out and go retrieve it-
---
Because I don't have a FTJ, health issues ...  besides a slight FO76 addiction.
---
Ehhh....one less person to hear whining about how piss poor a company is running things when they haven’t ran a business or supervised in their life.
---
Care Meter [|____]
---
Sorry for your loss. I have a brother in my life and he never wanted to play games or do any of that stuff I wanted to. Very cool your brother was willing to put up with a game he didn’t care for cause he knew you liked it. Especially if he knew he time was limited too..
---
Power armor skins cost around $12 if bought with real money.  That's more than Automatron.  That's almost a quarter of what I paid for the full fucking game at release.  Regardless of what the price should be, that's fucking overpriced.  If it was $5 that then it would be more in line with what other games charge and what I would consider paying.  But it being more than double what I think is fair?  That's fucked.
---
And yes, you can argue tax evasion can affect the consumer but it's indirectly, not directly.  It doesn't affect them the same way as shit like microtransactions, pay to win loot boxes, whatever.  It shouldn't be surprising when people get more upset at the latest game having day 1 dlc than the publisher putting it out doing bad shit like tax evasion or putting devs through glorified slave labor.  People get outraged easier at things that directly affect them.
---
Started today
---
Twisted Muscles imho just turns normal weapons accuracy into what Two Shot legendary weapons have as an accuracy debuff.
---
Well wait a second there pal.  They DID fix that one lightbulb in Grafton.
---
Someone should do the math on the odds of this.
---
Most of the "anti-cheat" stuff is going to be mostly moot once they allow mods.
---
The lack of an effective response to "cheating" could be due to it not being worth the time to combat it as once modding is allowed, all sorts of "cheats" will hit the system too.
---
People like you are the reason there a warning messages on laundry detergent. Also the kind of person that doesn't read said messages.
---
I really hope they hammer that nail perfectly too. Would be amazing
---
Have five because that's the limit. I have had many, maybe ten, twelve. Some got erased to try new builds, new things, etc.
---
No specific energy perks. It works like you said, for example commando affects auto laser rifles
---
thx :D
---
&gt; Are you implying the bugs were introduced from outside sources?
---
No I'm saying that the bugs are bugs in the game.  If the bugs are fixed the game is still the game, just with fewer bugs.
---
&gt;  As far as experience the grafton mayor is the best example, some didn’t get him in their ear all the time others did
---
Well no, that's a silly example.  The real examples of different experiences are that some people have multiple crashes/disconnects/server crashes per session where others see a few per month.
---
(I had the Grafton Mayor "bug",  the easy workaround was just to do the (easy) quest, then he's shut up for at least a day).
---
&gt; What Is your endgame?
---
At the moment? Finishing up my scout badges, doing atom challenges, farting around.  Lots of farting around.
---
What are your qualifications to say this definitively?
---
The ring is a bit out there, but I think they did a really good job incorporating it into the fallout lore with the vault overseer being crowned by being champion.
---
On a gameplay side. I REALLY enjoy it... when it's working properly. Thankfully I'm not on PC having to deal with the plague of hackers, but on PS4 stability of games has gotten worse than when it first begun. I get lag, which is just HORRIBLE in a competitive shooter, and I get blue screened atleast 1-2 times a night. (I never have problems with other games like this).
---
I love the style of gameplay, and I really like the new map. But the games got bugs that make it often too frustrating to play
---
My anti-armor automatic Tesla is fun.
---
Shot post from actual shit.  Nice.
---
I woke up to my controller vibrating because the owner of the vending machine that I was on was butt stroking me to get off his machine.
---
The fact these articles exist means they didn't get passed over lots of the things you listed caused huge amounts of blowback and hate.
---
Where is the hate you are on about coming from? this subreddit?
---
Yeah you're getting hit by a bug then.  VATS is finicky, it goes from 100% immediately upon activation I think, but then has a weird chance to drop to 0% or what feels like it before creeping back up to the given percentage.  That or starts at 0%, that or works normally.
---
It's broken like many others features.  In the beta VATS was trash and absolutely useless.  They patched it in the beta but since then bugs have been reintroduced including a VATS Melee bug.
---
Which is why I normally use guns in third person with a reflex sight even on snipers.  Cause scopes are pointless when my third person view can render in enemies the same distance as a medium scope and enemies don't always render in even with long scopes.
---
This game is ridiculous.
---
All shotguns lose durability per pellet? Is there a way to circumvent that large durability loss?
---
Don't call me Christ. I am bot.
---
That sums up the end game dilemma, the game is geared towards self made end game content (farting around) some really enjoy that self made content others don’t.
---
What Pokémon you playing dude?
---
*comes back to sub, wondering if things are better*
---
Ah.
---
Did you want a trophy for buying a video game?
---
To be honest, I am buying stuff off of the atomic shop with my earned atoms I get from playing the game, you have to keep in mind that. Not sure about others on this thread but I doubt I am the only one.
---
Sorry man, RIP
---
it wasn't a pay to win double xp atom shop item like the repair and scrap kit. ill take what i can get here.
---
50 cal
---
I get what you're all saying.  You wouldn't think making terrain dip where one of these basement foundation pieces is placed wouldn't be too hard to do, but ironically it is.  They can bulldoze trees, rocks, plants, but digging a bit of a hole?  Impossible.
---
I always end up in corners or in a new region.
---
The 50 cal is way better so much more ammo too
---
Definitely.
---
haha dont know whether to upvote or downvote
---
You made it ( just barely). Here's to many happy returns.
---
No, it does not. There is no "ground" and you can't "dig" it up to make shelter/bunker.
---
I think you should get wanted for all that stuff! Need more reason to get wanted also, like an XP boost.
---
This has potential.  A foundation piece with a trapdoor that loads you into a foundation piece placed under the map right underground, like a double-tall foundation piece but the top has collision detection and the bottom one has a terrain placed around it so you can build out and not see or fall into the void under the map.
---
Hardest thing would be coding the terrain underground to collision detect the world map terrain and not clip up above ground.
---
I don't know if there was legal action or not, I just remember the talk of labour problems and a bit of stink. 
---
Working for a dev studio is basically a dream job for many people though, so I doubt there's often much pushback from the inside.
---
We Fallout players take what we are given. This is no different.
---
With all the wallbreaches people are using to try to win, its pathetic, I have clips of people jumping out of walls attacking my team.(peripheral)
---
Its all broken man
---
This.
---
Nah they will take a bunch of all that pesky stuff you actually wanted and put it up on the store. Also rather than putting them into  one bundle worth maybe 10 bucks. They will split it up into 2 bundles  for 1200-1800  fake currency to disarm your worries about just how much you are spending.   Don't worry though your free 1650 atoms that you got with your debit card can cover one of those packs. See we are so good to you! You can still use that same  card  to purchase more atoms on the store though. Now that's how we celebrate the holidays!
---
Bethesda doesn't deserve any positive energy towards this game.
---
Then explain all the wallbreaches and moments where you cant aim down your gun nor shoot? yeah not so bug free afterall
---
cant wait until its a teenager so itll stop listening to its parents.
---
This, exactly this. THANK YOU.
---
Bethesda has done tons of shit and deserve their fair share of hate for it. But the key word is FAIR. And that's what the hate for Bethesda isn't, fair. As you pointed out, people hate Bethesda more than companies who have done worse shit. And also, people like to invent reasons to hate on Bethesda or at least jump on unverified information and spread it as guranteed truths... and it drives me really mad.
---
People like to describe Bethesda as extremely greedy company. Just your example shows cases of greed that makes Bethesda look like amateurs. Or Todd Howard and his "lies". Basically every "lie" is either something open to interpretation (e.g. what does non-scripted NPC actually mean), taken out of context (16 times the detail was said in regards to distant terrain, yet people deliberately omit the distant terrain portion of that statement) or outright made up (noone promised 76 to be bug free). Every week in gaming news we see bigger liers pop up, yet it's Todd Howard who gets singled out as a liar. Even if (big IF) all his "lies" are actually lies, then he's nowhere in the league of Randy "Magic Trick" Pitchford and Tim "Tencent Timmy" Sweeney.
---
What also irks me is when people try act all high-horsey and preach about moral, ethics, proper actions against Bethesda and how Bethesda supporters are "enabling" terrible practices. They are acting like paragons of justice and therefore marking Bethesda as one of the worst companies in the gaming industry. ARE THEY F\*CKING KIDDING ME? They dare to pose as moral people and pointing at Bethesda as the worst? There are asshole companies like CDPR, Rockstar, Epic, Tencent or Bioware, who abuse their employees, force them through inhumane amount of crunch and don't allow any amount of personal time, which all leads to mental health damage. Anyone who preaches about morals and ethics should first go and try to burn those scummy companies down before ever lifting a finger against Bethesda.
---
Which leads me to another issue I have with members of these recreational outrages. Double standards. "Oh I like Witcher 3, so I'm gonna ignore the employee exploitation" and "Oh I don't like Fallout 76 so I'm gonna be angry about some bugs and non-cosmetic microtransactions" are so against each other in principle, but the same group of people thinks like this. There are so many examples of double standards. My favorite is the bad Bethesda vs the holy Obsidian. A book can be written about how the truth gets bent when it comes to comparison of these two. 76 is constantly under fire for its bugs (and righfully so), but people ignore that in bugginess it reach FNV levels. That game was (and still kinda is) a bug shitstorm. 76 is at least able to properly detect and use my GPU, which is something that FNV couldn't and reduced my FPS by something like 70-80%. And no, it wasn't a fault of Bethesda engine, because F3 was quite fine in comparison. This was the result of crude and unsafe Obsidian's messing with the engine... And while FNV may be still the best Fallout game, it isn't just because of Obsidian, like the FaNVboys tend to remind us. The Outer Worlds show that Obsidian is good only at writing. ONLY. Anything else is sub-par. Compared to FNV, TOW is a fail. It just highlights how many parts of FNV were good THANKS to Bethesda. But many people won't admit it, because it would mean saying something good about Bethesda.
---
In general, I think that people want a scapegoat for the state of the industry. But as you said. Bethesda is the symptom, not the cause. And Bethesda isn't even the worst symptom. What many people throwing unjustified shit at Bethesda don't realise is that they make the gaming industry even worse. Many bad companies make it already bad from their side, but the toxic fandoms disrupt the industry from the gamers' side. Many companies are nowadays accused of not listening to their "fans", but we cannot blame them. From the companies point of view we must look like a bunch of monkeys throwing our feces around. Also, this is also the same reason why many non-agitated gamers stick to the companies, despite the companies being bad and greedy. It's because the companies at least PRETEND to care about us. With a "fellow" gamers all we hear is usually just insults, unless we blindly follow one of the holy companies like CDPR or Obsidian...
---
Sooo you're a game dev or someone with knowledge of the whole fucking industry...  Trying to say there's worse things done by others than Bethesda.
---
Cool.  Doesn't change the fact none of those developers or publishers lied blatantly again and *again and again and again directly to their playerbases for an entire year straight*.
---
Not the worst.  But they're getting closer to being the worst without a massive amount of money being involved from fraudulent practices, of which Australia has already dinged them so that number isn't $0 either.
---
to build camps that people message me about saying "cool camp"...I like attention and crave the approval of strangers
---
I keep expecting to luck up any day. It's a good sniper tho!
---
Appreciated! Making a second character soon. Seems that imma have 2 commandos!
---
Dps and accuracy goes to mg42 but .50 cal is way more practical as a all the time gun because Ammo
---
It is CAMPable.
---
To be fair I just want to point out a couple things:
---
&gt;Remember when Sony refused to host console mods *after* Bethesda finished developing the framework for it?
---
This got hated on hard enough to get fixed if I'm not mistaken.
---
&gt;Remember when Konami fired Kojima, refused to let him accept an award and canned Silent Hills?
---
The outrage might be gone, but they basically killed two of their biggest franchises with it and Kojima is now doing pretty well for himself, so I don't think there's much left to be outraged about besides the missed opportunities. 
---
&gt;Remember when Bioware just gave up on Athem's content roadmap?
---
This game absolutely got a ton of hate and outrage, it's probably the biggest joke in the gaming community as a whole right now and will likely always have that legacy until EA inevitably outdoes themselves again. 
---
That being said, I agree with the rest of the points you made short of Bethesda not deserving all of the hate they've gotten over this title. Besides all the points on that side of the fence I'm sure you've heard a million times, the bottoms line is (for me at least) that Bethesda didn't use to practice business this way (short of horse armor) and they made some if the most memorable and important games in the world to me and many other players. Morrowind was my introduction to RPGs that made me fall in love with the genre and franchise. Fallout 76's issues are significant to players like this, because both the Fallout and Elder Scrolls series mean a lot to us, and we want to see them improve and develop, not move backwards. 
---
At the end of the day though, you and anyone else are allowed to like and support this game and should if it's something you enjoy. Putting people down for liking it is dumb and not helpful to the aspects we find issue with.
---
Lived all around Appalachia. Made a bunch of friends and enemies thanks to NW. been a pretty eventful year in the Wasteland.
---
No it's not either of those, it's a dumpster fire with dumpster divers in firesuits jumping in then jumping out when a canister of aerosol explodes in their face, then jumping back in cause they apparently can't find something better to give their time too.
---
For all the shit the atom store gets: I've got all that stuff for free. So much stuff. Outfits, power armour skins, weapon skins, armour paints, more camp objects than I can name. All free. I've earned over 5000 atoms in 2 and a half months from daily and weekly challenges alone.
---
Prior to releasd, the main fallout sub was full of people outright saying they wanted this game to fail. Its kinda hard to convince subs like r/gaming the game is better now when fallouts own fandom is like that.
---
So edgy. People make mistakes, what I'm suggesting would make this particular mistake have less sever consequence.
---
Reminds me of the first (and only) time I got wanted. I believe it happened during the first month of the game's release. I picked a locked airdrop container and instantly became wanted without even taking anything.
---
A couple minutes later I hear a mininuke and die.
---
Them working on it isn't the point. 
---
This is from your own quote:
---
&gt;The flood of, Id be happy with no new content and pushing back wastelanders if they worked on fixing bugs post \[...\] Welp, maybe just maybe this is it
---
That's just provably not correct. You even admit as much.
---
You can try and weasel in that they MAY still do so in future but as today, no new content, pushed back Wastelanders AND not delivering on fixing the bugs. 
---
There's no maybes about it, Bethesda still didn't deliver even on this request.
---
F*** ya make nw easier to get to 100 on. Im not the best so really helps with double xp.
---
Dude you forgot the biggest shit of them all "BLIZZARD"!!!
---
Very good points... except.
---
Fallout 1st cost more than Xbox Live.
---
Which indicates Bethesda went to Microsoft, sat down with a team of cost analysis engineers and said... "NAH. WE'RE GOING SICK NASTY WITH THIS."
---
If a Fallout 1st subscription cost as much as... literally any premium video game subscription, maybe there would be a channel open for discussion. But it doesn't.
---
Because there isn't. Xbox Live, PlayStation, Epic Games, Steam... Bethesda failed.
---
Fuck. The more I scrolled down the more depressed I got.
---
This...
---
Either way this is the worst fallout ever made, I don't know how they could make another fallout 4 yet so much worse
---
I got the exact same list from Scorchbeast Queens I didn’t kill. It was a joyous glitch
---
No, that's kind of weird, and I don't know what that guy was up to, but the 0-weight chassis in your inventory is unrelated to that.
---
*"What about?"* 
---
That's all this post is. As if having a dog turd left under your desk is okay because your neighbor has one under his desk too.   
---
*"But look!"* you cry, tears welling in the corners of your eyes. "*they own a rottweiler, it's absolutely massive!"* 
---
Well, guess what, I have about 20 mins before the cake timer goes off, so I'll indulge your little game of *"what about?"*
---
All of these companies have been lambasted, many in much worse ways than what bethesda has gotten. EA has won the worst company in the world award multiple years, and they're competing with literal weapon and arm manufacturers. Their glowing, radioactive pile of crap known as anthem is still fizzling in the corner as the last bastion of its players sit in a tiny subreddit sharing *positivity* in a tiny circle jerk with only the plaintive hollow cry of "more content?" to split the silence as darkness closes in and EA wonders when they can pull the plug without too many people laughing at them. 
---
Take two, 2k, gearbox, and Randy, "*squirting is magic!"* Pitchford belong in the same shitty box. To say that they're *"getting awaaaaaaay"* with their escapades is laughable. Everyone involved with this debacle has been dragged to court, or countries are passing legislation SPECIFICALLY to combat them and their crappy ways, such as the loot box issue, or Randy's skeevy funstunt. I don't know about you, but if I was Bethesda, I'd be glad that the only reason I got dragged to court was being forced to give refunds for the broken, buggy, misleading game that I released, and I'd be glad it's *only* in Australia. 
---
Chucklefish, as scummy as they were, made it clear the people involved weren't being paid. No one held a gun to their head. They signed papers saying as much. The main thing I could hold them accountable for was the whole "well you *might* get a job" when they knew the vast majority of volunteers wouldn't. It's hard to feel sorry for people who blatantly say "I understand I won't be paid for my work on this project" and then do it anyway. What is chucklefish gonna do? fire them? Oh noes, my non-paying job. 
---
Ubisoft and Konami are both smeared and laughed at in the industry, Konami moreso. People aren't buying Konami's games, that's why they've been doubling down on slot/pachinko machines. Ubisoft just got lambasted over Breakpoint. They made the decision to delay three different games which meant they took a stock hit. See, even a company as crappy as Ubisoft decided to make a decision that hurt their bottom line to try and improve the games they have down the pipeline. What's more, people inside Ubisoft are saying that management is going around and asking for new and unique ideas to make games about. Can't say that for Bethesda. That being said, I still won't buy Ubisoft's dogshite. Not unless I see some major changes when it comes to their MTX crap. 
---
People still joke about the epic store. Activision is still terrible, blizzard and their recent spat with hong kong is noticeably missing from your list, either because you forgot about it, or because it didn't fit your narrative of *"but look what they're doing to poor bethesdaaaaaaaaa!"*
---
Oh and telltale is dead. There's nothing to do with the corpse of a company. Some other company is wearing its skin now, but it dead. 
---
In the end, I went through a lot of this for really no reason other than I had about 20 minutes to burn when I really could have said "Who gives a shit?" Other companies being shit doesn't mean yours gets to run by without a word. Whether you think the response was proportional or not is down to your personal opinion, but for me, I would be thankful players are shouting at my company in a subreddit and twitter than have countries passing laws that actually target my company and it's practices. 
---
Something to think about next time you think about doing unpaid PR for Bethesda. You know, Chucklefish is hiring if you need unpaid work that bad.
---
Actually kinda glad it’s just double xp, sick of getting side tracked and not getting my dam possum badges ...also wanna level a new character :)
---
I am a Bethesda fan. But you have to understand comparisons like this are not helpful in creating a better situation. The best it can do is excuse them from striving to be better. Just because youe friend steals things doesn't make it alright for you to steal things. You should strive to be better than your friends. Betheada has traditionally been free from this kind of nonsense, but it hasn't been true for a few years and that is a shame. You can't convince me theor fall from grace is okay just because everyone else is doing it. I want them to be better than everyone else.
---
Yeah. I mean honestly when was the last time a schorchbeast was a notable threat.
---
Is there any news on a patch to fix some of the bugs?
---
I wish there was some sort of risk/reward associated with being wanted.... like if you survive an hour as wanted you get a big xp reward or buff
---
I've seen Amazon selling the "physical" version for less than $40. There are some copies labeled as used that are being sold for almost half of that, but I wouldn't trust those.
---
People do make mistakes. Some people learn from them while others try to place the blame on someone else. How many dialogue boxes do you need warning you of the consequences? How many of those would you ignore? This is your fault,  not Bethesda's.
---
cuz the game's bad and buggy af, bruh
---
Douchebag meter full though, obviously
---
Entitled shit.
---
Not defending Beth here, but Rockstar’s GTA rootkitted my PC years back, I hypocritically still played and enjoyed rdr2 on ps4  Has Beth ever rootkitted?
---
Oh, I don't think they're okay, I just think they're not as bad as other company's, but are being by and large treated like they are.
---
One day had work to do, so I took the munitions factory and sat in a corner, let it farm away as I did work.. next minute I must’ve called asleep cause I wake up to a guy slamming my prone crouched chameleon character with a super sledge.. god know how long he was looking for me!😂
---
Overwatch wasn't the first game to have lootboxes, but it sure as hell was the one to make them socially acceptable in games. 
---
Anyone can make a bad decision, it takes a terrible company to make it an industry standard.
---
It will also be filled with people defending anything they do
---
Combination of incompetence on the developer side and  general lack of care. I mean this is Bethesda were talking about here, It would be crazy to assume that simple percentages work as expected .
---
As someone who use a tse mg42 and tse 50 cal lemme give you the run down 
---
The 50 cal is nice because ammo is easy to craft and that's about all it has on the mg42, mg42 blows threw ammo and it's ammo is crafted in smaller batches , but if you prime the mg42 its the ultimate gun, its ammo is nkw crafted in batches of 170 and gettimg the mats to craft it adds more endgame content , not to mention its cooler looking and cooler in general , but I now solely use the mg42 and can go days without needing to craft ammo, and you don't need to nuke any weird spots to get ammo, whitesprings and site prime have all you need! You don't even need to launch a nuke yourself just server hop till you find a good server
---
I didn't say it's not my fault for not reading the warning. I don't see why an item should be deleted when dropped when skinned that's all. I'm suggesting that it'd just drop without a skin rather than getting deleted for good which isn't that fucking controversial.
---
I saw cdkey selling for usd14.
---
Was try to look below that if possible for mule
---
Crafting ammo for the mg42 is a huge grind. If you get one you will want to prime it,  makes crafting ammo much easier but you still need flourescent flux. 
---
.50cal is good for general use, ammo isn't hard to craft, does good damage, large magazine size. 
---
Mg does amazing dps because of the fire rate and I love the way it feels, its my favorite heavy gun. It just has a small clip and crafting ammo is a nightmare. 
---
I have both, and I would say try to get both. My .50mg is 1 star bloodied and still destroys everything. 
---
.50mg is the Dailey driver truck, while the LMG is the weekend race car.
---
Oh look!  You didn’t have the balls to keep your post up
---
Thank you. This has actually been the most helpful comment thus far. How much would you say a bloodied rapid MG42 would run me?
---
I really wish they would shuffle older stuff a bit more too, they are returning items that were vaulted like a few weeks ago. They could easily include older stuff along with the current stuff they returned.
---
50cal is the practical one, LMG is the cool one.
---
My advice - get both and keep the 50 for the really bullet spongy stuff like SBQ, as you'll want to cry seeing LMG draining your ammo on it.
---
Furthermore, I'd advise 50 with rapid fire, and LMG with explosive, as it really doesn't need that extra 25%, but additional kick from explosive is quite nice.

Its vats headshots for me that miss....targeting torso seems to work like it should
---
Oh look the guy that got 3 of my comments deleted because they were to hard on you lol
---
Generally speaking any thing bloodied is super fucking expensive , ive never bought bloodied before because  two shot explosive never stopped being bad its just not the meta, id say around 20k , maybe more depending on what perks it has, some people might even insist on a trade only for it too
---
heeeyyy, don't report stuff like this  :D , happens to me to, have you found a way of controlling it ? it seems to just happen randomly :/
---
... nothing to be proud of.
---
I had to post it like this so it didn’t get removed ahha 
---
Yes I found a way to reliably make it happen!
---
You can never go wrong with things people don’t want to seek out but need. Right now a ton of people making ammo so acid, steel, lead and plastic go fast if you can sell bulk. 
---
No new perks to speak of but also handy to have super duper to make a bunch of stims for people. 
---
What system are you on? If your on PS4 I could prob toss some things together for you. I know I’ll be on Saturday afternoon.
---
Yeah, I definitely know that now. At the time it made sense though, especially with my ticket to Bethesda promising to investigate.
---
Do the  MG42 exist as a Legendary ? i have never seen a ledg. version of it :/
---
&gt;Whether you think the response was proportional or not is down to your personal opinion, but for me, I would be thankful players are shouting at my company in a subreddit and twitter than have countries passing laws that actually target my company and it's practices.
---
That doesn't really answer the question though. In your personal opinion; 
---
&gt; Remember the direct harm most of these caused people? Remember the **amount** of rage and backlash each of these generated? Now remember the **amount** of rage Fallout First caused? Do they stack up? 
---
If you think Bethesda gets the right amount of hate and everyone else comes up short, sure. I'm quite open to that. But if you think that the outrage towards, say, Activision firing 800 people compared to the outrage Bethesda got for their handling of Fallout First was proportionate, that the culture of internet outrage serves as a functional meritocracy to harm done, you've got a *real* steep uphill battle ahead of you.
---
Many good points here.
---
I'll also add a C) -- People who do anything that isn't reliably popular with the surrounding group may or may not be motivated to publicly out themselves.   
---
Even when they are, attempting to express a really unpopular opinion can potentially risk negative repercussions.   
---
Exa: Some people in this sub posted that they'd either experienced or witnessed people who subscribed to 1st getting griefed. So a person who doesn't specifically enjoy PvP and/or a bunch of higher level players showing up to mess with them might feel less inclined to comment on a thread about how much they loved that feature.   
---
I typically really enjoy debate, but there are still moments when I don't feel like going out of my way to proactively seek an argument with a bunch of people who I've never met. I've also had total strangers read my online content &amp; then proceed to stalk me in real life... including things like showing up at my workplace every day &amp; following me to my car &amp; etc. Some people who have that experience begin to feel less motivated to seek out new opportunities to potentially irritate an unknown number of people in a forum, heh.   
---
But since you mentioned it directly, I'll out myself! I totally have a collectron. Like many other games in my life, I paid a whopping $0 for the hundreds of hours I've spent in 76. I've spent most of my life in living situations with 1-7 other gamers where we all had consoles &amp; bought games &amp; shared our games with each other, or having close friends and/or partners who shared games or etc. Given the option of buying a duplicate copy of a game that I can already play whenever I want vs buying something small &amp; cosmetic in-game, I'll often choose an in-game purchase.   
---
I got the collectron because I like having companions at my camp, especially robot companions -- which has also been a feature of previous fallout games. My brahmin isn't very interactive and also seems to spend most of her time floating in the air, appearing underwater &amp; then disappearing, and getting murdered. The other options I currently know are to build your camp around in-game content in a place where you'll already have a "pet" (areas in which cats spawn, etc.) and/or to tame an animal. I've already done &amp; continue to intermittently do both of those too. But I don't like having to maintain a high charisma stat at all times, especially cuz I game solo more often than I play on a team. I get around that with alt characters but don't view it as ideal.   
---
I've frequently built my camp in existing houses, cabins, etc. or near locations where a quick circle around the area would produce significantly more free items of higher value. A free junk resource node produces a lot more items at a higher rate of speed than the collectron.   
---
I suppose there could be people who are spending most of their time hanging out at their camp repeatedly emptying the collectron bin to rejoice in its latest offering of another cymbal-banging stuffed monkey which cannot be displayed in the display case. But I use the bin so rarely that I regularly forget that it even exists for extended periods of time.   
---
It's easier for me to understand grievances about the refrigerator cuz I can't build my camp in a colder location to increase food longevity or etc. But I also wonder how many players truly spend a lot of time collecting &amp; cooking specific recipes and/or frequently experiencing starvation. I primarily dine on delicacies like human flesh and dog food. I can't recall visiting any camp with a refrigerator so far where the camp owner was using its functionality.
---
Understand what the word "relatively" means? Nuckear winter has less than a dozen bugs compared to the hundreds in the rest of the game.
---
I blame Bethesda.
---
I cant upvote your post enough. Thank you for accumulating this info. Hopefully some people will understand and be more realistic. But alas, most of the loudest people of society are also the dumbest. 
---
And hopefully game devs will stop corrupting the gaming market so much, in general. Cause holy crap this list is bad.
---
I stopped playing fallout because of the subscription. But I did it out of choice. Not insensible rage.  When the game is good enough to warrant a subscription, in my consumerist opinion, I'll buy it. If not. Then. I wont buy it.  No need to send death threats to Pete like so many of these other schmucks.
---
What gun you using? And are you crouched? When chronicled in vats you gain better chance to hit
---
Ooh, neat! I've never seen anyone intentionally use broken walls or other items.
---
&gt; Just because your friend steals things doesn't make it alright for you to steal things.
---
There is another way to view this thread. If Bethesda is relatively tame compared to the rest and someone condemns them for it then they had better condemn all of those companies too. If you refuse to buy Bethesda games, you should refuse to buy their games too.
---
it would be cool to be able to make a character have a limp or a missing arm or an incurable disease from the start of the game. also would like the option for a diaper-butt character.
---
Play with me if you are into murdering low levels.
---
Sony did eventually allow console mods after a few months of backlash from Bethesda and users but they **still** won't allow any original assets, basically kneecapping the system for their users.
---
The Kojima one was kinda the odd man out of the list, I'll fully admit, as the outrage was the right amount, if not more than enough for the problem at hand.
---
As for Anthem; the broken promises of the roadmap haven't really been made up to its playerbase. It's just a dick move from EA and/or Bioware.
---
I do think Bethesda going from industry darling to another cog definitely spurred a lot of detractors (similar to what Blizzard has been/is going through), but there's also definitely also a lot of bad faith actors involved.
---
Yup. Especially because some items won't even be visible to others if they're destroyed.
---
I agree with that, the launch made me so disappointed with the gaming community. I enjoyed the game from the very start, so to see the community turn so vitriolic so quickly was sad. I wanted to share my excitement in a new fallout world and everyone was complaining about some canvas bags.
---
Nonetheless, we're all the ones that have to suffer 🤣
---
Bloodied ffr weapons on reddit usually dont sell for caps
---
"How does the amount of hate Bethesda gets stack up to the rest of the industry?" is a very valid question, is it not?
---
I'm not saying don't hate Bethesda, I'm saying how much hate *should* they get, keeping in mind the rest of the industry?
---
Yes
---
Chin up, brother
---
I often go AFK in my camp by playing piano. I nodded off long enough to hit max caps and lost an unknown amount of caps as the game lets players still buy stuff even though you’re maxed out. 
---
In GTAO, I fell asleep once and some guy decided to pad his k/d by killing my character about 15x before my controller disconnected and I idled out. Don’t really blame him. I probably would have done same thing if roles were reversed. ;)

I may be an even older time gamer but please don't feel sorry for me because I enjoy the challenges. First of all, they give you free Atoms. You didn't mention this so I assume you are not into Atom shop stuff. Fine, I enjoy personalizing my experience with some of the stuff in there. Some challenges are really easy and take no time. Great, quick free Atoms. Others can provide some guided play that might take you to a different place or lead to a different experience. I check them every day and decide which ones are worth the effort or time to get the Atoms.
---
After launching the nuke and after it lands, leave the world but be sure to join private again within 3-4 minutes. Sometimes you need to leave and rejoin 2-3x. 
---
But once you get them to spawn, they will re-spawn, with Legendary’s every time for about 4-5 cycles. Once the nuke shower fades away or if the legendaries run dry, you’re done. Wait until the 3 hour Cooldown is over and rinse repeat. I do this all the time.
---
Yeah and Nestlé and Pfizer and P&amp;G also do bad shit, but how does that change what other companies are doing? Other companies in my industry are worse than my company, but I work for my company, so obviously I care more what they do.
---
Am I not allowed to be upset about a game that **I paid for?** I don't play Konami games, or Telltale, or games from almost any of those other companies you said anything about, so I really couldn't give a finely diced dog turd what they do. I am effected by what Bethesda has been doing, so **yeah duh** I give a shit.

There's a safe in the cockpit of the remains of a plane at the Eastern part of Morgantown airport. There is also a floor safe nearby under the stairs of the second building going West. Lastly, I believe there are green locked containers hugging the wall of the building that is South-West of the control tower.

Hope this helps!

There were never any lawsuits as far as i know. A couple of days later people totally forgot about it and went 'praise geraldo! Cdpr good others bad' mode

I would use this point, however it's a big argument towards any game that sucks based on a critically acclaimed movie. That game was trash. XD literally.
---
Where can I check for 2nd market. Thanks for the information
---
Nope - Damage resistance got capped at 300 in PVP back when they capped weapon damage.  A lot of people didn't bother to read the release notes back then.
---
What's the subreddit.... R/iamatotalpieceofshit ?
---
At this point double xp has become worthless we already had it a couple times
---
Should’ve been 2x xp, 50% sale on legendary items, and free stuff from the atom shop that isn’t a fuckin icon
---
I'm pretty sure they just rushed the ever living shit out of this game so they didn't optimize anything. I'm pretty sure the engine can handle it if it's done properly but you can't expect that form Bethesda
---
If I'm a Bethesda fan and I've given my money to Bethesda then what EA is doing is of no concern to me. I should be less upset with Bethesda because Anthem sucks?
---
Why is this the only game sub I have been on where people are constantly dying?
---
Guaranteed it will either reset everyone or everyone that was 400 xp away will have to start over from 0
---
That upset you?
---
if I were you my man I'd check out brick and mortar game stores that sell second hand games. I got mine from aussie EB Games 3-4 months ago while they were having a clearance; 50% off everything.  
---
lol now that I checked its 15 aud atm, which is 10 usd more or less. no point in buying a non-used copy and supporting beth at this point, but game is cool for the first 50-75 hours my man; I'd say go for it!

&gt;The expectation for Wastelanders is high, a return to fallout 3, Skyrim or Oblivian quality story, with choice consequences and impact.

They are going to be let down. If its going to have consequences what about the rest of the players? I don't see it happening.
---
On 76 I have only ever nodded off while in a menu, sleeping in game or crafting. So I typically wake up in menus getting attacked. Now with other games I've ended up all over the place notoriously walking into a corner or walls with those invisible lips everyone on racing games hate. Lol gtav never had that issue because of the amount of things that vibe the controller. The day I fell asleep cruising online in gta and the bumps on the road woke me up, I have never badmouthed that game since. I found that utterly delightful.
---
They've been covered, yes, but haven't really caught the same amount of public attention and vitriol (Kojima and arguably EA's studio closures withstanding).
---
Some like the development of Anthem definitely made the rounds but didn't gain any real traction. Other stuff like Chucklefish or Activision firing 800 people were pretty niche and never really gained *any* mainstream attention.
---
Remember; the point isn't "Did these things get hate?" it's "How much hate did they get in proportion to each other, and were those proportions deserving?"
---
And yes, this sub definitely got hijacked for a good 2 or 3 days there. Set the filter to top posts this month. It's a big ol' yikes.
---
“We get that all the time”????????? Not sure what game you’re playing at all we do NOT get double xp all the time lmao. I agree they could’ve done more but we’ll likely get a Christmas event &amp; just had a Halloween Event. To think we’ll get 3 events so soon is pretty foolish. Even if we don’t get a full fledged Christmas event they already confirmed we’ll get stuff through NW which if it’s on the same level as the Halloween stuff I’m fine with it.
---
Poop haha , well for one id say focus on mods for guns that don't have any , the mg42 only has 2 , and 1 of them comes pre attached
---
You lose. 😂
---
The added option to make builds. For example: a camp build, a melee build, a rifles build, and scavenger build. Something where we can preset perks and the select option 1 through 4. Quick and easy rather than manually swapping perks.

Lmao

Endgame here, the mg42 , coolest gun in the game , bit hefty on ammo tho , gives u something to do when u get the mats tho
---
Really I slogged thru it and I undoubtedly had good times but I have never felt frustration playing a game like I have Fo76. (Another year like this and I'm sueing Bethesda for marriage counciling.)
---
Damn, dude. I’ll speak your names to the gods.
---
You are just a garbage shill.
---
&gt; And hopefully game devs will stop corrupting the gaming market so much, in general. 
---
Oh, don't your hopes up. It's generally not developers, it's publishers. And even then it's not really publishers, it's the upper management and suits of the publishers. And even then it's not really the suits of publishers, it's the shareholders and investors that elect the suits of publishers. And shareholders are so decentralized and disconnected that the only message they ever relay is "make my investment go up, I don't care how".
---
The problem isn't the industry has the wrong people, it's that the entire corporate structure and culture is toxic, exclusively self-serving and detrimental to it's employees and consumers.
---
Perk loadouts are confirmed to come next year. They might lump them in with wastelanders but that's hopeful.
---
You can pick up another game though
---
It’s a “rifle”
---
its mostly parents who listen to rock music now. kids are tiktoking or something instead.
---
No other game I have ever purchased was as blatantly low effort and shameless in monetization as 76.  This is also a 76 subreddit not r/gaming so this whataboutism just makes you look like a sucker for Bethesda fucking you over, OP
---
rifleman, then?
---
an upvote for you because you're not alone on this!
---
&gt; Am I not allowed to be upset about a game that **I paid for?** 
---
I never said anything close to that. The point here is to compare the collective outrage directed at Bethesda to the outrage at the rest of the industry. It's right there in the title.
---
&gt; I don't play Konami games, or Telltale, or games from almost any of those other companies you said anything about, so I really couldn't give a finely diced dog turd what they do. 
---
That's a rather odd ethical standard. Everything is permissible so long as it doesn't affect me. We have *very* different worldviews then.
---
&gt;  You didn't raise a point 
---
Again, in the title;  **and how Bethesda compares to the industry.** To do that, you have to point to the industry and so I did.
---
Yeah they did the right thing and put all the copies of the game in a trash heap and burned what they could. Same should have happened to 76 but Bethesda is remorseless and knows no shame in the face of an easy dollar from the suckers who would buy shit like fallout 1st
---
could you play this weekend?
---
woop woop! thanks budday!
---
Unarmed uses less damage perks but has essentially the same damage potential as 2h melees, the only downside is that you cannot use unarmed weapons while in power to. Unarmed actually benefits from both the Twisted Muscles and mutations.
---
Talons

Since you want to tank stuff, a junkies build would be the best way to go as certain addictions have almost meaningless debuffs.

i was walking around watoga and i walked into one of the fissures. lost all my ballistic fiber so i was very unhappy. now i store everything in my stashbox very often.
---
You're only judging Bethesda on their own, which isn't what this post is about. It's like the title says;  **and how Bethesda compares to the industry**. EA is apart of said industry so comparing the hate they get to the hate Bethesda gets for the purpose of examining Bethesda's place in said industry is *fully* in-line.
---
I suggest you switch world's, it cause even if you kill him he can come back with better guns

I fell asleep making my eastward, woke up heading west.

Early on fell asleep making my first camp, had to spend the next hour curing a horrible case of dehydration and starvation.

Worse one was when I fell asleep and bought the free states bundle.  Turned out to be a pretty good bundle I use often. Except for the truck beds.
---
I had fun making this list! Gets me excited over nothing haha!
---
God I would love this in 76, especially if it’s got that ping effect when reloading too, but knowing Bethesda this’ll be a little too much to ask for, prepare for death by a Todd Howard hitman clone to come after you very soon
---
Of course. ^(Stupid goddamn news cycles....)

Unarmed melee is pretty simple.  Pick up the BoS  combat armor plans in Grafton, mod five pieces of combat armor, grab a power fist, death claw gauntlet, or death tambo, and your good to go.
---
(Unarmed weapons do a ton of damage).
---
No messing around with ammo or power cores, just run up to things and kill them
---
Fair enough but I thought it was funny.
---
What platform? I’ll buy em
---
If I may ask, how old was your brother when he passed?
---
1.  Look at Daily/Weekly Atom tasks.
---
2.  Do tasks while shopping at other camps for cheap stuff or minor upgrades to weapons &amp; armour.
---
3.  Join events, SBQ, etc. as they come up.
---
4.  Go back to camp to fix guns, re-fill vendors, and server hop.
---
5.  Repeat until tired.
---
If you have pacifist mode on and don't attack him I don't think he should be able to touch your camp though..?

Dunning-Kruger is strong with this one.

Hi. First time user of discord. I would love to be a part of your collective.

Doubt

I did, but it was too late. They destroyed my entire camp, and left me broke by killing me when my turrets attacked them. This is why I hate people on the internet. most of them act like this
---
Workshops are pvp zones
---
But my camp is NOT
---
Big boomer energy. I'm just being honest.
---
I didn't bother them after they killed me enough to go broke, but they still destroyed everything
---
He was a true brother in more ways then one, condolences on your loss.  The perk Cards are a titty twisting subject, he wasn't wrong. Peace to you.
---
I did, but it's too late. I have 0 caps, and my camp ended up as a pile of rubble...
---
I love 76 but hate its corporate dealings. Will never buy 1st even though this is the only game i play. Will no longer be buying atoms.  Will think very carefully about any future purchases from this developer. Wont be burning my copy as its somewhere inside my playstations harddrive and i use that megafan as an alarm clock.
---
Pc
---
Ps4 JonathanYoshee will be playing this weekend but starting from scratch. I have played a long time ago though so I know the basics (well from literally a year ago).
---
I plan to basically bulk just about everything I do not use so I will probably be a junk treasure chest once I get a vendor until I collect more plans for useful objects. I know selling the ammo itself was hopeless back in the day but keeping comps for it ready for folk is a good idea.
---
Rather than the plans or items themself if you see me and want to drop tips to quests locations with useful plans that will be most helpful. Especially anything new they added to the game that is useful. I know grinding workshops and doing the power plants used to be ways to collect specific plans.
---
But ya once I get a vending camp rolling I probably will be mostly bulk junk and supplies. I tend not to burn thru items very fast and when I last played used mostly food for boosts and healing so I will probably be selling most of my stims/chems I find until I get to harder areas.

76 is just a bad version of 4 with way less content and a half assed "multiplayer"

At least he can rest peacefully knowing all the karma you're going to get.
---
Then why are you bringing it up in an accusatory way?

Oh man. Xbox unfortunately. Thanks though! I’m sure someone will definitely buy them!
---
Hey I know how to get 100% accuracy in VATs all you have to do is pay Bethesda 7.99 USD and then buy a 100$ fallout 1st yearly subscription and then you pay an additional 5$ to buy 100% accuracy.
---
Seriously, this would be potentially enough to make me excited about playing FO76 again. If modders can add it to FNV (look it up), then Bethesda has no excuse to NOT include it. That being saiiidd.... I don't trust Bethesda to give it to us for free.
---

When I start nodding off, I end up pricing things in my machines weird. Logged on one morning and had beer priced at 200 caps, another at 4 caps, a broken non legendary at 3k.... water at 1k... it can really be a mess, lol. When my bf nods off, he just gets stuck in a corner or starts walking in circles....lol
---
They think the youtuber was wrongfully banned. 
---
Bethesda said he was rightfully banned. 
---
I think Bethesda is telling the truth

lol ahahahahahahahahhaha you are just replying to every negative comment there is aren't ya? what a sad thing to do lol, defend a company without earning any money :( if you are tho, and I hope you do, kudos to you, you are doing a great job!

Unfortunate. Thanks for the reply tho. Have a good one.
---
That's fair enough and there's nothing wrong with that. Bit much to call out people as you tried to with your post when we both agree they just haven't delivered to date.

Look, I'll just take them launching Wastelanders fixing the majority of the major issues with the game. That's more than plenty given their past history.

It’s generally preferable to have armour suitable for all situations - vanguard / bolstering (generally vanguard is more convenient).  Legendary prefixes hunter’s, exterminators, nocturnal, troubleshooter, zealots are good only under specific circumstances (not convenient) and are generally scrip material (along with regenerating and lifesaving).
---
Some builds or play styles synergize better with a particular armour type: unyielding for bloody builds, chameleon for sneaky stealth builds.  A case can be made to have a set of troubleshooter armour for nuke runs, sheepsquatch, and robot hunting at Whitesprings.  If you really min/max then a set of zealots for SBQ (though in practice only worthwhile if you are doing it solo or with low-power group).
---
Additionally, you may want some quality of life prefixes: one armour piece of autostim adds survivability; one chameleon helps with stealth.
---
As per your initial question, secondary prefixes sentinel (while stationary) or cavalier (while moving) provide a 15% damage reduction (though at 75% probability) per piece.  Also “powered” armour that enhances AP regeneration is sought after.
---
Interesting I have pulled 100s of bear arms,  staffs , clubs but not one crook

All content would be free

I will also probably look to buy modded or legendary weaponry from players whenever I find some that are affordable. Kind of curious to see peoples vendors and their prices.

I uninstalled 76 because of my hatred for Bethesda.

'it would be more in line with what other games charge'

What... No?

If I want a fancy new Lightsaber on SWTOR, I'm paying upwards of fifty to sixty dollars. Literally for a cool-looking husk with no stats or anything. Outfits are anywhere between 15 and 40 Dollars each.  
---
A new set of armor on ESO? Twenty Dollars please. A horse? Make that Thirty. Trust me - It goes even higher than that. And this is a game that /charges/ you for it's DLC.

Guild Wars 2? How about... Twenty five for a mount, 10-20 bucks for an outfit... What else? Hrmmm...

If you look at shim's history, they've posted several threads asking questions.
---
They didn't have to fix it my guy
---
\&gt; Remember when TakeTwo used British tax loopholes to avoid paying any  taxes for Rockstar North for 10 years while also claiming $51,000,000 in  subsidiaries? Or when Activision Blizzard used tax schemes to avoid  paying taxes, resulting in a $1,100,000,000 total of back taxes and  potential fines from the UK, Sweden and France?   
---
there are a thousand things to criticize Rockstar and their business practices since GTA5 but this is dedefinitely not one of them.  \^Taxation is fucking \*\*theft\*\*
---
Man, I want to throw a reward at this comment so much.
---
oh wow... I'm speechless. I don't know how many times I've sent the news link from Bethesda launcher to my friends whenever they asked me if there are new stuffs on atom shop this week.
---
Based on a few AP threads on Reddit the reference in this Wiki is not entirely correct:
---
- Reflex and green dot sights also provide -15% AP reduction
---
Automatic: -59%
---
Aligned barrel: —5%
---
Aligned stock: -5%
---
Stabilized actually does not help AP
---
This is based on extensive research by authors - not my personal research.
---
I don't think it's just you who would settle for those two things.
---
Not sure if it's a rumour or already confirmed, but I have the feeling you get more enemies when running silos with friends than doing alone.
---
From this sub, shims made quite a few posts asking questions.
---
Sounds like an amazing person. Sorry for your loss...
---
Really?
---
What is this I don't even
---
"I can cancel your membership!"
---
"I already did.."
---
OOF
---
One thing I truly enjoy going back and playing Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas, weapons holster on back/hip.
---
Essentially, I can play in your evenings. 9pm on your east coast is 1pm to me
---
Right I didn’t think I was the only one who liked that.
---
Of course someone else will play on that server. 
---
They’re not an infinite resource. If I clear out West Tek and loot everything and then quit the next person to get that same server can go to West Tek and still clear it out and loot everything.
---
Dude it bugged the hell outta me in FO4.
---
i enjoy the weird little things that affect item management like the 800 stash, the food and drink,  the diseases, weapons breaking, the fast travel charge etc. being able to have my own shop, build my own camp, have ppl visit, show off my character and gear. mutations. helpful vault dwellers that will craft for you or give you gifts.  i enjoy also doing the same.  
---
----
---
i dont expect that to be a good enough answer really and i agree that im probably in the minority about this.  i think fallout 3 is probably the best fallout ive played.  but 76 is still my favorite.
---
that but also The Witcher 3. Its the same reason Rockstar consistently gets passes(notice I said consistently). Put simply, they make amazing games. I have little doubt that the initial backlash to Fallout 76 would not have been quite as severe if Fallout 4 had blown everyone away. I always viewed a lot of the skepticism and jadedness towards the game in the earlier days to be essentially a continuation of people's disappointment with Fallout 4. Basically it just gave people another excuse to say "see look! Bethesda doesn't know how to many RPGs anymore and just wants to make dumbed down crap!". Not that conversation has shifted to the idea that Bethesda is never even going to make epic singleplayer RPGs anymore
---
Um well they are a little more difficult to kill than about 95% of the other enemies in the game.
---
Also have you stash in an out of the way spot at the workshop so you can stash it quick as well. Putting one in the open makes it easier for the attackers to stash your loot if they do get you. Make them waddle somewhere else if nothing else.
---
Test servers, badly needed.  Even if they're just for pc at first.
---
I missed Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas last year. I was a bit busy at the time. So, I have none of those items. I would like to see them come back.
---
Sorry for you loss man. What system are you on?
---
Im sorry but that movement and aim is straight up painful to watch.
---
Not for me at all. I've had a couple teammates dashboard though.
---
Nop
---
Build and scrap
---
Hard to tell sometimes and I'll probably get downvoted for this but is it an actual loss or did he just stop playing? If he is actually irl dead or just quit entirely? Sorry for your loss either way, especially if its an actual death in the family. Those hurt a lot. I should know.
---
I think u have to scrap a lot of them or buy the plans
---
Legendary power armor (even if it is just 1 star), a reason to level up way beyond level 50 (besides fleshing out your character), more weapon mods for weapons that only have a few or none at all, adjustments to some item loot pools to allow a bit more consistency (mostly for the SB Queen, remove Ultracite armor plans, and let her drop more Ultracite power armor mod plans). 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;!but first and foremost, bug fixes.!&lt;
---
Are there any bot venders that sell the plans? Or a way to get them through world drop/event drop?
---
I think this is cool of them, but what of faschnaut?
---
I woulda bought them if the actualy guns and launchers o NBC them were chromed it looks weird having the new look with rusted guns in them.
---
High intelligence help learn mods faster. Not sure if luck effects it.
---
Careful OP. 
---
You’ve pointed out that Bethesda merely released an optional service in a game with zero competitive elements that only offers QoL improvements. 
---
And that much of the gaming community **the majority of whom commented never played 76 for any significant span of time** reacted in the most hysterical, outrageous, and preposterous way possible. 
---
You’re about to be called a shill and “part of the problem” for taking such a level headed approach.
---
Sorry if it was worded weird. Wasn’t in the best state when posting. It was my brother and it was an actual loss. He lost a long and hard fought battle with cystic fibrosis.
---
Xbox for me. He played on pc and Xbox.
---
unarmed, unyeilding x4, life savings x1
---
That's not true. INT has no effect except for the stats of crafted weapon.
---
Are radium rifles even useful as there are no humans in the game yet?
---
So I don’t know if people who commented on this will get a notification but I’m hoping on now and will add people who wanna join in
---
He also just wanted load outs for the perk system. He bitched relentlessly about this.
---
But he's right. That's the only way.
---
I've maxed nearly every gear mod getting a mod nearly every scrap with an int of 21. I've tested it, quite thoroughly.
---
It just bothers me that I don't know all of the mods, and it's a pain to try and get any from scrapping
---
He was 36 and had cystic fibrosis so he beat the odds as far as living that long. Average life expectancy is late teens. We were lucky to have him as long as we did!
---
Very sorry to hear of your loss, OP. May he rest in peace and may you find solace as well. Might I ask what brought about his untimely passing?
---
Anecdotes are not proof, sorry.
---
I get that. Anyone who's been playing the game over an hour gets that.
---
Not an anecdote. I have 3 alts that have all done the same.
---
GG bruddah and great vid
---
He will rest peacefully knowing he doesn’t have to swap out 3 lockpick cards for the glowing one card. Fuck the karma.
---
But... you asked... he answered...
---
Still not a proof. There is nothing in the files suggesting that INT affects rate of learning mods.
---
Lol, I feel attacked for being helpful
---
Yeah they need to put more effort in at this point, Hire more people if needed, change management. Something. This first year of 76 and been handled very poorly by the devs and it's obvious they don't give a shit from what we can see from how they put content out/patches/ lack of. It took them one year to get 76 into a stable state, server wise and they want to charge us for it. LOL
---
Wastelanders needs to be put out on this so called PTS before they ship it, so they dont further damage FO76 and can properly ship new content bug free/exploit free.
---
Do better BGS, we know you can.
---
It's intended to be that way for anyone shooting at me 😂 But that's just me toying around with people.
---
Long live the exploring food builds!!!
---
They aren't going to allow mods in NW.
---
Okay seriously I'm confused. I thought I'd heard that at least one was perm banned with no hope of reversal?
---
Thanks so much.
---
I expected to see a cute fluffy ball of feather...not...this.
---
Following this sub now just feels like watching a train wreck in slow motion with closeups of every single fatality.
---
Blocked the dumbass. It does effect the return for scrapping items, don't let the troll tell you otherwise. I've done it several times over, and even the damned wiki says it does.
---
I shop player vending a LOT. First thing I look for are Disease Cures and Nuclear Key Cards. Then Stimpacks and Radaways. Then weapons. 
---
With weapons you need to be careful so you don’t end up wasting your caps and your time. Since I know for obvious reasons the little summary doesn’t tell you what level the camp owner is, sometimes you see something like 25+ weapons when in reality, none are legendary and they are all low level. When you fast travel to a camp in the Forrest region and the first thing you see are wood framed square structures, you know you’re in for a low level vending experience. 
---
I realize that there are many players that benefit from these types of vending. I’m just not one of them. 
---
I try to find the player on the map first to see their level. I realize that many low level players are actually just alts or mules but the XB community is really a rather small one, and I have friended most what I would consider to be “End Game Player Vendors” that run a tight ship. 
---
Of course you need to be prepared drop some heavy cappage. You often get what you pay for.
---
Back next March I'm p sure
---
You clearly don’t get it...
---
If you’re so experienced in the Wasteland, why are you even asking?
---
Here’s another **obvious tip** for such a fucking obvious question that you’ve asked
---
#Equip super duper
---
:-O
---
You can buy a limited number of sight plans from vendors
---
(Before you come back saying I’ve lied, ^dishonour ^on ^you, ^dishonour ^on ^your ^family, ^dishonour ^on ^your ^**cow**, RNG for vendors having the plans. Because I’ve no doubt, you were *unaware* of that)
---
Then what are you asking for?
---
😂👍
---
Shooting around corners is a latency thing,
---
Only get disconnected from the match but no crashing
---
Don't know what you want then. I can't just magic up the mod knowledge for you bud.
---
Remember when Funcom ceo deliberately sabotaged The Secret World development and was put in jail for insider trading as a result
---
You're incorrect, and also probably about 12 years old since you're gonna throw a temper tantrum and block the dude and call him a dumbass simply because he was correcting you. That's not normal social behavior.
---
Not sure what the OP was hoping for...
---
I think there’s a couple in that big market/hotel area and in the enclave area
---
Hrm?
---
no taming only requires rank 3 animal perk period the being twice the lvl thing is wrong and so is needing wasteland whiperer
---
Long fought battle with cystic fibrosis
---
It's been at least 4 times before this.
---
It grants **more scrap** when scrapping items
---
Not more chance at mods
---
Hampered by duplication exploits, they're the only thing allowing people to get those weapons!
---
Also it is bugger and laggier now than it was during beta!
---
It takes forever. Not worth it. I got a three star radium rifle so I bought the plans and made about 75. Used all my screws, scrapped them and got one mod......
---
A scope. Not impressed.
---
Can't wait to see the fan boys try to defend this one
---
Could have fooled me. Like I've said, tested it, a great deal of times.
---
you're being ridiculous. I made a specific point and I didn't bloviate. I stayed short and to the point.
---
ok2k
---
Hate to say it, but the guy you blocked was correct. It was confirmed long ago that INT doesn’t help you to learn mods, it only allows you to produce more scrap from disassembling weapons and armor. I’m sure you can find the post from the data-miner who originally found it in the files.
---
The games been out for a year...? 5 times in a year is all the time? Like I said I agree they could’ve done more for 1 year but double xp doesn’t come all the time &amp; I’ll use this opportunity to max out my NW rank &amp; get those sweet masks!
---
Ah right
---
I'm asking to see if I missed anything. Super Duper maxed, Gunsmith maxed. Even all of the science perks equipped. I'm aware pf RNG on venders. Even full Uny armor.
---
I cant believe how many tards still play this game no matter how much bethsoft shits on you you just take it and say yummy more more please may I have some more
---
I just want to learn them all for the hell of it. Gotta do something in this game.
---
This has literally nothing to do with 76, though. This is all the Bethesda Launcher.
---
5 times a year makes it more than once every 3 months.
---
stop picking at the details.
---
Then no, you haven't.
---
Lmao. I highly doubt it. Looking at gameplay with a controller is just clunky and awkward to me.
---
I wanted to see if there was anything else I could do to increase the chance.
---
Thank you
---
Wtf are you on dude? You literally said we get it all the time... 5 times in TWELVE MONTHS is NOT all the time.. not picking at details I’m literally repeating what you typed. Take your meds and go to sleep dude you’re talking nonsense
---
The ultimate whataboutism. The entire video game industry has been trending into some shitty, shady territory aside from a handful of developers (FromSoft, CD Project Red).
---
If I missed anything or other tips I didn't know. In hindsight I should have been more specific in my post
---
A lot of people still think the armor penetration cap is 75 when it's effectively 99%.
---
A lot of people think legacy weapons deal some special type of damage, it's not. An explosive energy weapon deals explosive energy damage.
---
A lot of people think the meat hook is the best melee weapon when in fact, it is the power fist.
---
The meat hook gets double perks but does not get the extra 3.5x sneak attack bonus from "covert ops + ninja", the power fist does, and the power fist has a higher base damage that scales better with buffs.
---
A lot of people don't know that the perk card "better criticals" does not stack with the extra vats damage legendary effect.
---
A lot of people think that if you all share "super duper" to your team, it stacks for a better chance.
---
All of the outrage over Fallout 1st seems bad, until you remember that a year ago, people were saying the exact same things over the non-canvas bag situation, and a wide variety of things. It seems like a meme to me.
---
To answer your question, no not really useful.
---
I really want the squeaky Mothman it’s so cute!
---
JEEZ I agree sooo much with that 1st point! This game ran soooo much better shortly after launch. Now, on my Acer Predator Helios 300 laptop, the game has turned into a FPS stutter hell-zone in the past few months. It makes no sense to me, and it's honestly the most disheartening thing for me with this game. I do my BEST to enjoy this game, but the lag just makes me wanna cry at times haha.
---
Fix that problem for me, and I'll be overall ok with everything else. Cheers!
---
Ya know that persons guns get sued up the ass by Bethesda if they try to profit off of their design. Make sure you inform this person of what they're truely gettimg into.
---
dude go away. Clearly when I said "all the time" I did not mean literally that it has been double XP every second that the game has been live for the entirety of a whole year.
---
Not one single person (other than you, who I really doubt is sincere at all) took it that literally.
---
just stop being pendantic.
---
Well that didnt take long
---
You're in for 3-8 weeks of farming/scrapping if you want to learn them all. There's an abysmally low chance of learning mods for each rifle scrapped. INT does **not** affect the chances.
---
It took me almost 2 months to unlock them all, but after 3 weeks of non-stop farm/scrap cycles, I slowed down a bit.
---
I misunderstood their statement nvm
---
INB4 Bethesda bans you.
---
We Game In His Honor Today! Best Wishes To Your Family!!
---
Bethesda's like watching a friend you've known for a long time succumb to addiction. You keep trying to say something to get their attention to the problem but they don't listen. They just get worse and worse. You used to laugh at the issues because, well, originally they were just kind of quirky and weird (bugs), but nobody's laughing anymore because the problems have gone from innocent quirks to destructive binges.
---
We're in the addiction stage where it's tearing them apart... and all we can do is sit by and watch.
---
Railway rifles are bugged so the perk "concentrated fire" does not work with them, it's because of the projectile type. If you get an explosive railway rifle, it will work normally.
---
Then idk don’t say all the time? Then get butthurt &amp; message someone well into midnight on a Thursday night because you’re butthurt about their response. Go to bed buddy it’s over already
---
Im blocking you now. You're being really stupid and Im just done with it.
---
You make and scrap them; Backwoodsman 3 magazine will decrease the required materials each by 1, then there is the Science 2 (I believe, might be Science Expert) perk that decreases the materials needed to craft energy weapons (apparently it is coded as an energy weapon). Then, of course, Super Duper to trigger extra radium rifles made. Then you equip Scrapper, you can slap on some unyeilding gear and get radiated to &lt;20% for the int bonus, I dunno if it works or not but I do it anyway and just start scrapping them.
---
There are also a few vendors that have Night Vision scope and stuff but all others are from scrapping rad rifles. Good Luck
---
I hear they smell funky too.
---
If God Howard and his team won't give me content, I'll make my own by pursuing a stupid quest of learning all of the plans.
---
Someone did the math and bolstering/vanguards is about 2% damage reduction per piece because of the sliding scale that DR uses, at the high end it does very little. The flat reduction is way way better.
---
Bye bye 🥰
---
Hey jackass, if you hate the game and presumably don't even play it, why the fuck are you here then?
---
Awesome. Thanks you
---
Same. There's nothing else in the vendor that accepts the tadpole badges that seems worthwile. I'm flirting with the Possum badges, enough to get the next level backpack, but really not spending that much effort on it.
---
why not just buff berserkers then?
---
You scrap them
---
However, for some reason Radium Rifle mods only have a **0.01% chance** (or something that low. I can't remember but it was either 1%, 0.1% or 0.01%) of learning a new mod upon scrapping. Which is why they're pretty infamous. You can scrap literal *hundreds* of Radium Rifles and *still* learn absolutely nothing
---
yeah buddy I've been stocking up on low lvl twink gear as well
---
cool story
---
Jesus that's low.
---
no marsupial, heathen (:
---
Pepperidge Farms remembers
---
That repair kits fix the game.
---
Jim Sterling is gonna have a fucking field day with this. His Bethesda coverage has been hilarious so far.
---
Good luck I'm still missing 2 camp plans, and the last few ultracite laser/plasma mods. Then I'll start on the remaining PA mods.
---
Nigga that's not what I asked
---
I know! Which is one of the reasons why barely anyone uses them. You'll have a better time scrapping and learning mods with Handmades or Ultracite Lasers than Radiums.
---
They don’t look exactly like the fallout one or anything really that’s what I expected when I went onto the page
---
Howdy pardner! Glad you're here! We can't let anyone say anything bad about fo76 now can we?
---
I'm trying to unlock the 35 ultracite laser gun mods. I have 4 to go - I'm after the beam splitter.
---
Did you manage that one?
---
Alright, if you're gonna be a jackass, at least actually be right. This has absolutely jack-shit to do with 76 and you know it.
---
Yeah, more and more features to test before they even get to the clunky movement!
---
I think the reason they haven't done this is the same reason they didn't in 4. They are to many different variations of guns and models to make it work. It would take a very long time to do the work for every variation of gun.
---
All it took was maybe a wazoo or something
---
This is yet another careless, incompetent decision by bethesda - same company that develops fo76. Every single software they developed since 2018 are ridden with bugs, exploits and microtransactions. 🤭
---
We play some very different games then.
---
Worst game I’ve ever bought. Very disappointed.
---
Wonder when the big update that actually adds in a story and NPCs will come out?
---
I've said this several times recently; Bethesda is just squeezing every ounce of profit out as it can, and if that means killing the game? Eh. They'll do "development" so long as they don't have to put more than a couple of people on that scope of work for too long. They'll give away "free" stuff like double-xp because its at no cost to them.
---
The worst of all this is the revelation that Bethesda doesn't consider fallout to be IP that they're fundamentally passionate about. Anyone with half a brain and a BS in BA knows that any future Fallout games will suffer tremendously after what's happened to Fallout 76. Very disappointing
---
Seriously... These jackasses make this game unplayable sometimes... I don't want to have to pay $100 just to get a private server so I can avoid the little assholes that ruin the game, but it makes me miss fallout 4 so much... I really hope they move on from this multiplayer shit in FO5... I want all these little griefer bitches out of my wasteland.
---
That it "Just works!"
---
Well said, but say whatever you want; Beth is rolling in dough. The people have "voted with their wallets".
---
So I'm a 'fanboy' for stating facts?
---
I'd say you're an idiot, but I'm pretty sure you're well aware of that already
---
What another icon for free? I’m sick of them but yet that’s all their willing to give at this point
---
I scrapped hundreds of them, still have one mod not yet unlocked, i give up 😭
---
np, Ive been getting several of these, I have 2 bffr and a couple aaffr less vats and a junkies.. So goddamn, I guess I better learn mods for it lol. I think I have like 27/45 mods atm if you're on PC I can try to mod it somewhat better for you.
---
Do they deserve the hate? Yes. That being said, all the other companies deserve just as much hate for the things you listed.
---
Might have to do with the fact this piece of shit launcher is typically only used for FO76...
---
the imposter sheepshquatch outfit is wide
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Very buggy today, crashed during the SBQ fight, three other SB fights, froze three times and I had to exit.
---
Cute
---
Still has jack-squat to do with the actual game itself, though.
---
Hey youre on ps4 yeah do you need a camp rebuild?  Ill fix it for you if youd like.  Inbox me the persons name Ill send it to free lance bounty hunter.  If you want me to rebuild youre camp lemme know Ill do it for free no worries just inbox me your psn and when i get home ill hook you up.
---
They tried to prevent griefing as much as possible, but it clearly wasn't enough
---
Yeah it hasn’t been like this in a long time but the past two weeks have been real bad. Not server disconnects just horrible crashing while even doing simple things like looking in the pipboy
---
I haven't looked at them in a while? Not since before they started showing the mods we know/don't know.
---
I want to do that idea of taking on scars after each death, but instead my character gets thicker for each player I'm able to cannibalize.
---
21 gun salute with handmades..
---
Sorry for your loss OP. May he Rest In Peace.
---
If I was on Xbox I’d definitely team up with you. I’m on PS4. Sorry for your loss.
---
It's in line with this post. But he's saying it doesn't matter overall. Like he said, he should hate Bethesda less because EA sucks? It's textbook whataboutism.
---
...the double xp came at the perfect time for me.
---
Yeah was going to say this, the terrain is comprised of meshes. Can't manipulate it.
---
but juice, that's not working either.
---
They are a privately held company it’s impossible to know their financials.
---
Shhh quiet or they'll ban your Bethesda account
---
I don't like challenges, I do them for the rewards, and because there is nothing else to do. 
---
Right now I'm playing nuclear winter and paying very little attention to it, because I just want the rest of the rewards so I can be done with it. I like to do it on double xp, takes less time. 🤔
---
PS4. I have a 1* bloodied one, and got the prime auto receiver from Queenie. So decided to keep it until I have all the mods and try it out.
---
Never knew the fountains counted as dirt, like the old rug trick then?
---
I logged out with 3 minutes left on the shutdown timer only to see the launcher have news about the hotfix 2 days ago instead of any news about the update to the hotfix about to happen.
---
Dropping the ball on things..
---
Are you making to many group posts?
---
Remember the horse mountain climbing glitch? Or the glitch where you could escape vault 101 as a baby? or the oghma infinium infinite level glitch? Good times
---
Good good times
---
Had two Mirelurk Queens rubber banding tonight.  Solved it by changing weapons.  .50 cal to Plasma Gatling for the first then reverse for the second at the Freak Show.
---
No I stopped mostly since I joined here, and I only made one on my main acct when the ban was lifted
---
Would really like double or hell triple xp in nuclear winter or maybe even double the caps for completing events
---
Everyone loves caps
---
What the fuck is wrong with you?
---
You're right. But dev costs estimated about $100mil (not hard fact, just the only number I can find), selling 2.5-3mil copies @ $60+ each (at least $150-180million), the microtransaction store bring in recurring revenue and the $100 yearly sub, I'm gonna conclude that they cleaned up quite a bit and the money will only continue to roll in.
---
I find them or get rewarded them and scrap them to unlock the mods you can’t buy as a s from vendors.
---
You're not wrong if it was 15 years ago when alphas were actually the stage where features are still being added.
---
It's called dlc now
---
If someone discovered this, the YouTube views for it would pay for 5 years’ Fallout 1st.
---
And I only use my main for fo76 so the other accts were so I can party chat. I set them offline and parties were inv only
---
eyebot with a opossum mohawk
---
You're an absolute genius
---
It used to be like this near launch :)
---
thank you kindly
---
I mean you may just have to watch who you talk to and who you hang around unless someone is falsely reporting you
---
Log Cabin oh yes
---
My 1st thought too. But then I looked and they are different enough to be safe I think. 
---
Mothman and Sheepsquatch are RL legends. Bethesda doesn't have exclusive rights on them.
---
I mean i bought it for 5 bucks so no complaints there🤔 anyways not the worst i played tho, that was mafia 3
---
There goes another account so that's 7 times total within 2days
---
Live action service, get with the times my dude
---
🤡
---
I think that's whats happening because I've only text m my group and party chat with my group. Bio is empty and my gamertag is just a variation of this username
---
I heard one of the Santa's today.  I thought a broken bot was near me
---
Sorry dude, I'm Xbox. Thanks for the offer though!
---
What you should do is get xbox enforcement to review your case and you may get your answer to why you're communication suspended
---
If he's really your brother just go visit him in his room.
---
Gunsmith
---
*Slowclap*
---
If you’re killing everything faster then there’s less damage done to you and your gear.
---
I got my very first one earlier today. The guy I was messaging back and forth with also got the same ban. 
---
I refused to do the form to reduce my ban because i will not admit to wrongdoing nor will I acknowledge that I violated any Terms. 
---
I thought it was because I said I was nuking White Springs and it was construed as hate speech or domestic terrorism.
---
In the outer worlds you can send items to a designated loot tab.
---
Ya I just did that because I only do stuff on my main acct, the others I just made a cuz the ban and I only join party with those ones
---
I work in Cyber Security and I'm horrified. Well, time to get out the old Art. 15 GDPR template then.
---
That one is true. Run a silo solo hardly any enemies for the control room. Run a full group and it’s endless waves. Good times!
---
Yes ive gotten a 24hr and now a 7 day for no damn reason.
---
$5 is a good deal. I paid full price like a dummy.
---
That's crazy same here. Just confirmed my other buddy I play with was banned besides the one I mentioned
---
We were all let down....
---
Did they tell you why you were communication suspended on your main?
---
People were trolling me and being jerks and I think its cause I said are you trying to screw me over then I said learn english and blocked them. Guess they reported me idk. It was random and stupid. i swear they let ppl walk all over you but the moment you do anything you are the one punished.
---
I think something is wrong with xboxs system or whatever
---
I agree with you, it's really bad but idk if it's that.
---
If I wanted to pvp, I'd go near a contested workshop and die instantly to someone I couldn't see, like every other time.
---
No but I'm hoping to find out,I submitted my case review about 2 hours ago

Sentry bots giving me 1200 xp each so I hit all their spawn points in WS in a big circle that usually gives me around 6-7 of them so about say 7000 XP.  If you mash A on their death you can yank the fusion core so a nice byproduct.  
---
I kill the ghouls while moving around to the spawn points.  Just server hop over and over to  quick level, even in the 280’s.
---
You're too powerful to be left alive, but you're also too powerful to kill.
---
Oh I totally feel you but I chilled with saying stupid stuff to people. I literally never texted anything to anyone but the two main people I play with. Like what I'm saying is the chat accts have been offline so besides the two people I play with that I text with I haven't text anyone. And when my main was just 7day banned I did a lil experiment and didn't text or join any parties with it I had just posted once in groups then banned an hour later
---
If he repawned seeking revenge then he is marked hostile, and his camp can be destroyed. Don't go back to your camp if you've hit "seek revenge".
---
You cant have them at the same time I believe. You can have all except one of them.
---
Unless you consider killing the queen in under 30 seconds, which I just got a record for myself, toxic then idk
---
I think if you have one of either of those you can't get the other one.
---
So if I take herbivore I lose carnivore?
---
Thank you and I totally agree
---
The pacifist mode is useless... Idk why tf they don't just have "adventure mode" Be completely non-pvp, and keep that shit in "survival mode" for those who want to participate... Or pacifist mode should just make you unable to harm or be harmed by other players.
---
You become a human
---
Okay, comment that again, but in english.
---
Jealousy of a well received and reviewed ARPG? Who'd have guessed.
---
Like one time a dude on groups was selling a lvl35 bloodied gat laser 1star for 30k and I was like that's not worth it and for 5 minutes he was trying to explain why it was. I said you amaze me and you're retarded. I got my first ban in 9years over that, which I do understand. Since then I been cool
---
It can be a bit laggy sometimes. But it is perfectly safe in there
---
&gt; That one is true.
---
Eh don't think so. When it comes to horde generation the game tends to be buggy, happens on Guided Meditation and Uranium Fever. It's just a coin toss whenever you get a large crowd.
---

---
Must. Get. Pink. Asylum. Outfit.
---
And I just discovered you can't put a mini nuke in a display case either. WTF? Those are iconic Fallout items. What is the logic behind being able to display .38 ammo but not a mini nuke? Their decisions baffle me sometimes.
---
The amount of enemies spawned in a wave is both random and guided by a server wide spawn budget. When you only get 1 or 2 a wave the budget is used up find a new server
---
Perfect.
---
Explosive energy weapons do 100% of the base damage of the weapon unline non energy explosive weapons which only do 20%

Sbq can change her animation in the middle with no issues. She can land in the middle of an animation as well
---
I like you. This is going to give me and my team a bunch of stuff to check over!
---
Oh shit foreal!? I knew about mothman but I thought sheepsquatch was just some nutty thing they came up with? Well I take back everything now. And even tho they didnt come up with it it's still freakn awsome they would put it in the game, they're one of my favorite enemies to come across.
---
It's somewhere in between according to /u/Aten_Ra
---
Source for better criticals, please.
---
It actually does 100%. Unless the weapon has ballistic properties naturally the modifier doesn't work correctly and ends up taking 100% of the base damage
---
Oh dear still though sorry for your loss.
---
I appreciate the offer! I should be okay. I was just bummed at the time because I just got a legendary furious lever action rifle a few days ago and wanted to learn mods for it so I could put a suppressor and a better receiver and stuff like that. So I’ve been building and scrapping lever action rifles but I keep running out of screws. So I spent an hour or two collecting 30 screws and just exploring, then went back to my camp. That’s when this happened. And I was just bummed I have to use half the screws I collected to repair my camp. I’ve been playing this game on and off since the beginning, but don’t get a whole lot of time to play so was pretty bummed when this happened.
---
That's why I'm surprised you are giving a different answer. I know exactly who you are and you like to give half answers instead of admitting you are ever wrong. I'm still waiting for a reply about armor penetration.
---
That is what they said. Doesn't mean it's true. And 1st isn't an Atomic Shop purchase, it's a subscription.
---
And before I give a full detailed answer on that I'm looking at the raw code of the game to try to find the exact way the damage calculation is done. Once I find that I will tell you exactly how armor pen works
---
You're too sensitive :/ just ignore and play.
---
It's an atom shop purchase. Regardless of how you get it you do get atoms and atomic shop attire. Explain to me how it's not an atom shop purchase?
---
I think we are just using different terms to explain the same effect on armor penetration. When armor only reduces the damage by 50%,i would call that "armor penetration". But you seem to disagree and call it an armor calculation or something. We are looking at the same formulas
---
 Heart of the Swamp making Strangler Blooms spawn 
---
Thats actually true, you just can only get them from the 3-4 pods at Dyer, and only once per "respawn" cycle.
---
I got to pick them twice at weekend just gone, Friday(Thursday?) and Sunday
---
Armor penetration is an actual Stat in the game and decides how much of a targets dr/er the damage will ignore during the calculation
---
Overwatch lootboxes are fine though.  They give shit loads to you, there is never a reason to feel like you need to buy lootboxes and they actually are purely cosmetic.  The game also isn't a trash fire of bugs and incompetence like 76
---
Had this same problem a while back and feel the pain completely. Hope to have you back soon 👊
---
My friend thought I snubbed him yesterday because I joined a random world since he appeared offline (he'd been playing for an hour)...once he joined my world and invited me to party, he appeared online.
---
I've only got the one friend to go by because all incoming request are hidden before I can click them and wow that's a "forever alone" level excuse.
---
I can help you out there. I need to revive someone in water for the Swimming Badge. I will PM you my IGN.
---
Yeah I understand the frustration OP. At least we get free games with it. Tbh I would see if you can find a PS+ membership card online or in stores on Black Friday so you don't have to burn so much on the monthly subscription or whatever it is
---
ok but perk cards really do suck
---
Appreciate it 👊
---
lol you believed the dupers back in February didn't you
---
Thank you brother 👊
---
Damage reduction works on a curve not on a flat 1 to 1 basis. It's not actually ignoring any armor. Because damage reduction works on a curve that means that it has diminishing returns over a certain value. Dr and er will never reduce damage by 100% because of this.
---
Yup, already sent. Geneziza_Sicken is mine.
---
alright, thanks
---
yeah, on consoles I only play non-multiplayer exclusives. And I see no reason to buy F1st too, but I don't judge anyone - it's your money ;)
---
Yeah I hope they don't care, and that the sales numbers are ok for BGS. It's only the reddit and FB communication managers that get all the shit. They make a nickle and Jim Sterling makes a dime
---
bro you act like i hate all NW players, i let anyone play whatever 
---
perhaps i used wrong words, im just looking for opinions on NW
---
Oh I'm not paying for first lol. I'm saying if eventually I decide to get it I'll get it on PC so I'm not giving PlayStation and Fallout subscription money 😂
---
Needing rank 3 animal friend is also a myth. According to dataminers, only deathclaws and mega sloths require rank 3 to tame. Anything else can spawn and be tamed with a lower rank. I've tested this and found a tamable lvl 1 radrat pup with only rank 1 equipped.
---
thank you
---
Really? TSW was ace though! And it still lives, even after a F2P reboot
---
My first character at 400+ and why does he need this double experience?
---
Recently I started a new one, and I definitely don’t want to raise it quickly by level - so he is offside these days.
---
They pushed wastelanders back to focus on implementing fallout 1st and rip off their customer base before the end of the year.  They will get around to putting NPCs into the game when they have a lul between ideas on how to make money off the idiot payerbase
---
You don't make a 36 year old do anything. He chose to and wanted to play this game with his brother.
---
You already got your free and totally useless Wavy Willard player icon which has absolutely nothing to do with anniversary theme. "Aren't you grateful?"
---
Oh, wait, that was another company that promoted that kind of relationship with their games' fans...
---
The Agricultural Centre locks just make the Mr Farmhands hostile to you (if you've completed the event to make them non-hostile).
---
Except it's the other way around. It's not the damage penetrating a certain amount of armor. It's the armor blocking a certain amount of the damage.
---
If you can build a set of armor with +agility for the Dodgy perk this can be one of the tankiest close combat builds (lots of comments about going unarmed, so I worked with that advice)
---
I've sold them for 2 caps each when I had close to 200.
---
Godwin's Law dude, you just lost.
---
*gets insta killed by legacy bloodies explosive laser rifle from stealth*
---
That's just semantics... What do you call the amount of armor that doesn't block any damage? The ignored armor? The reduced armor? You certainly don't like calling that armor "penetrated".
---
All armor reduces damage. There is not amount of armor that is ignored unless you have armor penetration through the stat
---
Thank you very much. Let me know when you need to do other group challenges. Like taking pictures, revival etc.
---
Damn now every one knows
---
I think almost everything I watch on Forgotten Weapons should be in FO76.  There is an American automatic flintlock rifle they featured that would make black power weapons awesome, if done correctly.
---
Lost what?  I am on OP's side
---
Only played a few hours past couple of days, crashed 3 times.
---
will do, have a nice day and thank you as well
---
Do you like Jim Sterling as much as I do? :)
---
Those early days were so pure
---
&gt; Yet I've Never had them bloom outside the event. 
---
[Freshly taken just for you.](https://i.imgur.com/gyWQ81M.png) I can upload a video on youtube as well.
---
&gt; I know there are Pods over the river from Harpers, south of the Motel, is there not a Heart of the Swamp spawn a bit east of there?
---
Yeah, pods are all over the place but no one has ever taken a picture or video of blooms outside the Dyer area.
---
And please don't downvote me, I'm actually giving out evidence of it unlike the dozen of articles and posts talking about the event.
---
What did you loose?
---
If you move your camp it will fix everything but you'll have but it'll also store everything so you'll have to place it all back down. It's a nice trick if your decontamination shower gets destroyed
---
That's not true at all, damage will always ignore some of the armor, we already agreed that armor is not a flat value for damage reduction. The amount of actual damage reduced is based on a sliding ratio between the incoming damage and the armor value. When incoming damage and armor are the same, damage is reduced by 50%. The ratio reduces damage less and less as damage VS armor goes up, and the opposite as it goes down. 
---
The incoming damage ignores a certain amount of armor, or as you said "the armor blocking a certain amount of damage". That's saying the same thing.
---
Remember when all this bullshit is coming from the top down because some exec wants to buy his 9th beach house.
---
Bug fixes. So many bug fixes. And some anti-cheat measures that actually work. Oh, and better balancing.
---
Shared stash. Only needs to be 100 lb, as far as I am concerned. More would of course be better.
---
Better end game gear acquisition than pure RNG. Let us work towards our desired Legendary gear with some tangible progress.
---
Global trade. Add a global market that can be accessed at the Whitesprings. CAMP vendors are a nice incentive to go and visit other people's CAMPs, but as an actual trade channel they are cumbersome and way too limited.
---
Cap sinks that are worth sinking some caps into. A global market might fix some of the uselessness of caps, but then again it might not.
---
Not just perk loadouts but also gear loadouts. It's a bit tedious to put all that armor back on after switching to the hazmat suit. Also, a way to mark gear- especially armor - as "not for sale or scrap" that isn't just the favourites wheel.
---
Better power armor mods.
---
Didn't down vote you.
---
Though that first vidoe only showed that they weren't blooming for you, which could of been because you picked them recently.
---
The glowing skeleton looked ridiculous on my fat main. I have noticed some things that don't look that good.
---
The vault suit gets the golden bands to widen over the belly but get thinner up at the neck. It just gets streched. It's not ideal and I think that given the option to be fatter things would clip and strech in awful ways. Probably it's the same thing with alowing characters to be thinner.
---
The issue was corrected and anyone saying “oh but the items weren’t returned”, she went on to Facebook to say how it was all duped anyway ( as I suspected, dumbass tried to dump her entire duped collection at once and thought nothing would happen).
---
For real. Being dumped from a server minutes after say loading up the giant mining wheel would be very annoying. There are too many events that require expenditure for half hour+ investments of time for this kind of shit.
---
No you're actually still getting confused. What I'm trying to tell you is that your idea of damage always ig oring armor is incorrect. Having the same amliunt of dr/er as the damage coming in does not reduce it by 50%. If this was the case you would be basically invincible early game as you would usually have more Dr than the incoming damage
---
Good days and bad days really. 
---
I found this little punch bowl while out shopping the other day I was pretty stoked about the free drink even if it tasted funny. I was happily walking through the forest then blacked out and ended up on the edge of a cliff miles away from anywhere I had yet discovered and I was overencumbered. 
---
I walked slowly to the north west hoping to find some sort of station and low and behold I find one with a stash box and a helpful bot. 
---
As I approached the door I hear a screech and just as I run out of AP a barrage of green mist and sonic booms (not burnt face man) take me out before I reach the fast travel point. 
---
Don’t drink alcohol kids it’s bad for you.
---
At least give something out for Free in the Atom Shop in celebration.
---
J-25-90 Flamer I was about to trade. Not the worst loss but still it's kinda dumb.
---
Sorry for your loss :(
---
I always heard you'd just have them both and there would be no effect (aka they'd cancel each other out). I'll have to test it out sometime and let ya know
---
It happens friendo. Could have been worse. But look at the tits above downvoting any form of suggestion to the little perfect precious game.
---
Problably didn't help
---
Thank you for an excellent write-up.
---
Very useful.  Now will reconsider my armour preferences
---
I'm playing 76 literally because I've played 4 for so long that I'm bored of the world. Being able to mod the game is such an overwhelming plus that it has taken over a thousand hours of play for me to choose 76 over it. Bullet sponge enemies in 76 is such a huge downside that I had more or less negated through modding in 4, but I've turned literally ever rock over in that game and need something new.
---
It could be an interesting thing inside Nuclear Winter. Since no one could shoot out the walls to get to you, you'd stack carpets and create an impenetrable defense, all the while you are really in a bush lining up a headshot at them shooting your carpets.
---
Maybe something that feels claustrophobic? Having the sales counter behind a 2x1 space to display basic weapons and mods in. Extending into the shop owners bedroom being a 1x2 floor space creating an L shape for now, having locked security doors as the choice access point for anything locked leaving a final 2x1 floorspace in front of the sales counter to be a porch or the main room customers will be in with the appropriate workbenches where able.
---
If you’re feeling fancy, use the space on the opposite end of the building that doesn’t have the bedroom for a shooting range? Mount it up with some lanes and vault boy cut outs should be enough, lining the outside walls with a couple barriers and storage boxes like the wooden cabinet to make it look scrappy outside even some portable loos. I think you’d like the finished product when you’re done with it if you so choose to build it which would take up 3x2 floors if you don’t have a shooting range
---
No, when you pick them up they still show on the game as an object that you cannot interact with.
---
The photo is showing a strangler bloom, daytime, no event.
---
Thank you very much for the reference 
---
Very useful.  Will now respec my armour combos
---
I had to give this game up. I really liked it and was having loads of fun building my character, but fallout 1st was just the most disrespectful and disgusting thing I've ever seen a game company do. I can't support that behaviour and have stopped playing. Shame really but the game is a year old and still in no condition to be released. And you already know wastelanders is gonna disappoint
---
Our ancestors are rolling over in their fucking graves.
---
Thank you for the info and references.
---
I now have a better understanding of this game mechanic
---
Go back a few issues they announced its delay to Q1 2020 to concentrate on end year content. 
---
More time to perfect is no bad thing with Bethesda’s track record. 
---
Same issue as the private world announce
---
I'm no programmer, but the models/textures for every variant is already there. I cant imagine itd be unreasonably harder.
---
Now of course guns can become a pistol or a rifle and itd have to check for that first and all. But it loads all those modifications in your hand. I dont see why they cant be loaded on your back as well. I certainly do think it would take a bit of time, but I think they can/should do it
---
The games been phoning it in for a long long time now. Probably just gunna have "2000 atom 1 year anniversary bundle, exclusive for fallout 1st members" and that's it.
---
I’m extremely sorry for the loss of your brother. Condolences to you and your family. May he Rest In Peace.
---
Never argued the daytime part, unless your implying that Heart of the Swamp only happens at night?
---
The No event isn't confirmed in that pic unfortunately. 
---
The "problem" is that outside someone completing the Quest (For Rad shield plan) or Heart of the Swamp, I have never seen a bloom. Currently, I have never seen a bloom outside Dyer. I researched and found that they "only" bloom during the Event, now, I could be the victim of false positives, more testing is certainly required. But currently, for me (and it appers others as well) it appears to be fact, not myth.
---
Step 1 Build a weapon dealer shack
---
Step 2 live in it
---
Step 3 profit
---
I can highly recommend using large tents for basically the entire camp. They fit really well on a 2x2 foundation with a bit of space along two of the sides and you can have a few tents for a really outdoorsy feel. That's if you want to be a travelling merchant. I'd suggest a couple of tents, and a small L-shaped wooden shack with some angled roofs and random stash boxes and floor decor to build up the sides
---
I collected the full set once but every time I logged in a few would be missing.
---
I would replace them but same thing every time so I got rid of them except one and that stayed.
---
The gunshop Tuco stole a gun from in the good, the bad, the ugly. 
---
All right with everything everywhere and the goods in the middle and the back is a shooting gallery.
---
Wanna hear something cool? You have to pick em up from the ground, you cant buy em from vendors or let someone drop it for ya
---
I will be totally honest, couldn’t give two shits what the place looks like. Inside or out. Could be two vending machines in a field. Just stock it with high quality weapons at low, low prices. All 3* legendary, melee and ballistic. I will be there every other day with my hard earned caps.......
---
As others have said, no time limit except for the reactors unless you have lockpick 3. If so there is a door in the reactor room where you can hack a lvl 3 terminal and bypass the whole reactor thing. The nice part about the terminals is if you blow the password there’s no 10 second cool down before you can try again.
---
Just unlocked the last one - glad that's over.  I don't think I'll start on the radium rifles. Just scrap one now and then when I find one.
---
You are completely wrong. The formula for armor shows exactly 50% reduction when damage and armor are the same value. Having higher DR than the incoming damage doesn't make you invincible because higher armor has diminishing returns. You don't understand the formula at all.

You are currently comparing the formula from fallout 4 with the one from 76 which is why I wanted to find that actual formula before attempting to debate this with you. It's assumed to be the same as fo4 but it is not known if it actually is.
---
Lol idk that's what me and my squad do nuke after nuke after nuke
---
I thought that too, but I had to buy 2 others for this badge. When I logged back on later it accepted them towards the badge. Don’t know whether I just got lucky or what.
---
Well least you're honest lol. What weapons, ammo and armors do you like to find on shops?
---
I eagerly await a response showing that the fallout 76 formula is different from the fallout 4 formula. Until then everything I said is correct.
---
i had the idea to just use an existing vehicle somewhere to basically sell my weapons out of the trunk
---
using one of the military or firefighter vehicles and decorate it as if it was still running
---
i abandoned the idea but im sure somewhere on the map should be a suitable place
---
you just need to fit the vending machines in the vehicle somehow
---
So, you and your squad are receiving bans, you and your squad are repeatedly killing SBQ's before people can join in. Which is basically Anti-social behavour to the rest of the server.
---
Might be coincidence
---
When you live in a wasteland, you have to kill to survive.
---
I started out trying to be tanky as an unarmed melee. I've got barbarian maxed, the armor from end maxed, the armor from agi at 2 because it didn't scale as well, talons, twisted muscles, no chem addiction so I always use a chem at the start of a big battle, marsupial..
---
It's quickly becoming that I'm tanky, but not as tanky as power armor. I kill certain things ridiculously fast, other things not so fast so I have to jump out to heal. Serendipity even at rank 1 in luck has helped my survivability.
---
Haven't tried dodgy from agi yet, but I use a lot of ap running around and swinging so I'm not sure how well it'll work for me.
---
Endurance doesn't seem to scale too well. I have over 300 health but I'm also running around bloodied/radiated for extra str so it's kind of nullified sometimes. I thought about going over to power armor, but my new nocturnal +40% swing speed meat hook won't work with it.
---
If you aren't worried about killing things too fast for others to tag, a bloodied unarmed melee build works great. If you are, you need to run away a lot so things don't womp you while you wait for your friends to just shoot it already.
---
I'd definitely suggest trying power armor if you want to be tankier. My survivability can be hit or miss with legendary armor, and I don't have amazing stuff. I get by, but I feel more like a good dps than I do a tank.
---
This is an old projected build I was going for, though a few minor perks aren't at the level I had or I swapped in others. Mostly the same as what I was going for before realizing serendipity was awesome. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3f35a5&amp;d=a71s71au2l20i44e51eo1e00ej4eu0eg1pe2sb1ss2sf2s61se1a00l71lu1ce0am1sg2en1cm1&amp;w=p52ea0lt0lb0c10l90lm0i30ia0i50ik0p10pa0p80p90cr0c50c30ag2at1ij2lf0es1lp0ev0&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
&gt; The industry is toxic to its core.
---
Your entire post could be summarized with this short sentence, with the added value of not suggesting that we should moderate our reaction according to the wrongdoing of Bethesda's peers.
---
I’m a terrible person. I just saw this lol but feel free to add me on fo76! Psn is Katiemae92
---
Its a real celebration, so they put it on once a year at the same time as it's on IRL.
---
Inside the vault - community Edition.
---
You can probably build a PC capable of running 76 on medium settings for about $200. Maybe less if you can find some great bargains.  Check to see if there’s any computer shows going on in your area. I bet you could walk in to one with $200 and leave with 16gb ram, an 8gb card and a decent motherboard, plus some accessories.
---
&gt; The No event isn't confirmed in that pic unfortunately.
---
[Alright, here.](https://youtu.be/Sm5AXpAAESQ) Do you need even MORE evidence?
---
Happy cake day
---
Not really there's usually about ten of us that runs queens together. Which can be annoying when hopping servers but anyway have you ever ran a queen? It takes time for the nuke to hit,for the queen to come out and land= time for ppl to get there. everyone is entitled to play the way they want,as long as it's not trolling, cheating or whatever,and you don't have to join the event either. Why make your issue\problem my issue just join a nuke elsewhere or launch your own. If the queen wasn't meant to be killed so fast then that's Bethesda issue.
---
Can you set it to public?
---
Done.
---
Praise gun Jesus!
---
Called it!
---
Yes its still bugged.
---
We experience:
---
hard crashing
---
Doors not opening
---
Game freezes 
---
Codes not appearing
---
And if it turns out bug ridden, and comfortable in 15 minutes, there would still be posts here telling us all to give Bethesda a break and coming up with all sorts of excuses for them.
---
Wastelanders is make it break for me personally. I feel I am already a fool for giving them that chance, and if they nail it then I will put quite a chunk of my time aside to enjoy it and promote it on my channel as best I can.
---
But I can't help but feel that will not be the case, and yet we will have to suffer the usual nonsense on here about how we need to respect the developers and understand that they are trying etc etc.
---
Of course, if you use a fallout specific sub you'll see more Bethesda related stuff same as if you used an anthem related sub you would see more of that.
---
Also, Bethsaida kept doing things every couple of weeks they never got a break in this regard, but off the top of my head and in rough order:
---
The bag crap/Nuka dark rum/"only cosmetic MTX" oh look whats this repair kit/bans for finding the dev room/Bans for too much ammo for a 900 hour player/that personal info leak from support/fake discounts in the atom shop/mold in the helmets/noncosmetic MTX part 2 scrap kit boogaloo/fallout 1st/fallout 1st not working a la scrap box/ the"oh yeah we'll totally sell you gameplay stuff in the atom shop" "update" notice about 4 months after they started doing it/Banning the map dude for helping to pin down exploits
---
There, of course, are more I but I'm not going to look through all of yongyea's videos to refresh my memory.

They keep making shitty choices like really bad ones and they do it every couple of weeks any single one of these would be enough to piss people off but Bethsaida goes around looking to get the fucking high score in this instance.
---
I'd like to not have to think about this kinda stuff I'd like to go back to the days of Fallout 4, Skyrim, Oblivion and maybe even Fallout 3(new vegas 4EVA) But this is not a single-player game you can bend and make it do what you want we are stuck with what Bethesda want to do and enough of us think they make fucking awful choices.
---
Not true with that legacy gear and ton of stims - you need good build and gear that synergies with it - on novice I've done 2/3 missions solo and I barely play V94 at all (stealth sniper). Used maybe 2 stims and 1 radaway, was invisible almost all the time, one-shooted everything to the head.
---
Man I honestly buy crap from low lvls just to give them caps. I have had and hit 30k caps forever and never run out. It really kinda sucks because I always feel like its part of the game that turns off. And I littearly can't find a recipe or anything I dont have now. Iv been tossing the ball around for Christmas that I'm going to find a low lvls camp. Buy everything and drop it all for him. Or give him a pie and buy a bullet for 25k hell idk. But yeah we definitely need a place to drop big caps. When you get to a higher lvl and understand what sells for what. You can easily cap out in little to no time
---
Events like the queen or the imposter are good places to look for people that need reviving.
---
I'm a lvl 290 on pc, if I see low lvls I drop tons of stems and canned goods. If I'm really bored I'll buy a piece of crap from them for like 10k just to be nice. Or one of my 3 stars that isn't total junk. Damn you legendary vendor giving me crap I can't use.
---
I got a super cute mothman plush from a Kickstarter awhile ago. They still have some left on their website: https://www.fairyloguepress.com/collections/mothman
---
Okay that is heckin' dorbs
---
Enjoy your ban.
---
Well if you have a spare 99.99 dollars laying around somewhere that can very well be done friend!
---
Just read your update and by golly this is why I love this game and community. Hope you have fun out there in Appalachia.
---
Well as soon as I got out of the vault I noticed my pip boy was broken time would pass but not days. After a week I found whitesprings spent hours killing ghouls they just kept coming. I got my hands on a weapon that fired two shots and exploded. Really powerful felt like god until the point where I almost died since it didn’t one shot that death law. After that I realized guns don’t work well on creatures of Appalachia ended up whacking with a guitar I made into a sword. Kept having to rebuild my house super mutants would destroy it every time I left to get food. Now I live near flat woods running a inn/shop helping survivors I run across.
---
Not a myth, it did.
---
You DO know the quote was never a sweeping statement about all their products right? It was about a very specific new function that was added to Fallout 4. And it did work. It just did.
---
Get to lvl 300 AV mode, 290 now.
---
Solo the queen with my build. "Not melle or legacy so it's going to he balls hard". 
---
Get 100 in NW so I can put down that hacky mess for a bit. 
---
And solo the raid on normal....mabe hard if I get big dickus syndrome. 
---
After that? Burn all my 30k 50 rounds shooting at some random dudes house for 20 years. "Not destroying it just to make him wonder what the hell is wrong with me."
---
And then? Hell idk. Shoot more things...all the things
---
....
---
You were still expecting something from BGS??  
---
It is EXACTLY what I expected.
---
Handmades, bloodied melee, vanguard and unyielding sentinel. 5.56 ammo. The usual stuff....
---
Really sorry for your loss.
---
If I remember correctly it's linked to weapon weight. So add all the lightest mods maybe?
---
Fallout 1st was intended to come with wastelanders. I do wonder what genius thought only releasing 1st was a good thing though, lol
---
I mean plenty of other games do it pretty sure there is a mod for FO4 to anyway.
---
Ranged, stealth? Your not taking damage.
---
I’m sorry for your loss man.
---
Just a suggestion, if you built a shrine or something in honour of him, would it stay in the world forever?
---
I would like both options included.
---
And people like yourself who have possibly never played the game still lurk on the reddit to talk smack out of anyone who enjoys the game...yeesh give it a rest.
---
To be fair we can't have a different event every month. That's just not going to happen. I used to play Dying Light a lot (brilliant game btw) and that had several community events each year to earn new outfits or something. Kill 1m zombies or 100,000 headshots or something. Not as involved as the events we've had though.
---
Halloween is good. They did something for Easter (can't remember what) Fashnutz obviously happens... am I missing one? Oh and meat week!
---
They didnt create them, I can however agree to that they made them expose themselves.
---
Imagine if you were to buy the Fallout Worst subscription too on top. That would have been 25$/ month for a Fallout 4 asset flip, worst triple A release of last year, that was already sold at full price. How nice of Bethesda, love you Todd!
---
There are far more pressing matters to attend to xD but yes that would be cool
---
Yes, thats kind of what I said. And the part about it ”not meant to be in the game”, was actually stated by a CM on their forums.
---
I know I’m not trying to hate on the game at all I personally have a lot of fun I only say this as a pure aesthetic critique.
---
I think it's all tied to wastelanders. Basically I think it's all on hold. For example, if they drop in perks loadout it might not work because it's dependant on something that's not there yet because it's part of something in wastelanders.
---
Obviously this is guessing but guessing is all we've got.
---
I returned to F76 recently and this is a great way level up fast
---
I would say he's gone to heaven bit he's probably just gone to outer worlds
---
What is the issue? Greed
---
I think it's time for a massive overhaul of each company, refresh the industry but that won't happen, I know but at the same time it's possible as these companies start losing money and loyal people and more non-corrupt Studios become more apparent 
---
What you said is a good argument, it makes sense, it's not just Bethesda doing this but what can we, as gamers, do?
---
they also gave him 5 weeks to develop the game
---
It does. They told the game to do it anyway.
---
Don't get me wrong: I've throw stuff into the scrip machine and realised I was maxed on scrip already. More than once. But I'm able to accept responsibility and say that was my fault. Not Bethesda's.
---
wait, explain how you use that megafan as an alarm clock?
---
Check out electronic first, sometimes they have good deals
---
Why even make a request a lot of us know just isn't going to happen?
---
May as well as for the game to have a third person isometric camera view like the old Fallout games.
---
Not that I think a lawsuit is likely, but BGS almost certainly holds a trademark on their artistic versions of the mothman and sheepsquatch.  It’s kinda like your ability to make an elf shaped toy. Anyone is free to do so.  However, the more it looks like Link, the more likely you’ll get a cease and desist from Nintendo.
---
Ok this right here. Such a good idea.
---
He's talking about the pylon, not the door.
---
It used to work then Bethesda fucked it somehow a few patches ago, causing me to redesign my entire camp.
---
The whole industry is toxic. Capitalism is toxic. But we are playing this game, so we complain about this game.
---
What is a toady?
---
Sometimes you can get anual PS in stores for half the price. Sometimes. And yeah, it sucks in both consoles.
---
Just bought one at a robot vendor and scrapped it and got ' calibrated receiver' so it's possible.
---
If only they let could have let the NW halloween challenges it would have been useful. Otherwise, double XP means nothing (or almost nothing).
---
I guess you could say my character killed themselves, because I uninstalled the game a couple weeks ago. Fallout First was too big of a slap in the face. I *loved* this game, but Bethesda just wouldn’t stop fucking everyone over for every nickel and dime they could get their hands on.
---
Microsoft bought Mojang. This means Minecraft was removed from the hands of a racist, bigoted degenerate who has earned himself the ire of queer communities across the globe. As far as we're concerned, that's a point in Microsoft's favour.
---
Both the Edits really put a smile on my face knowing he did that props to u/Tyler91690 major respect for you for doing that when you didn't have to that's the community I love to see!!
---
Hope you're having fun and if you need anyone to play with r/PKOA would be a great place to go to as we have plenty of PS Players and feel free to add me on LycanWolfUK after I'm done catching up with D2 I'll be on just join on me and invite me to a team as I usually am on Public servers playing solo doing quests and such
---
You will starve to death
---
As i use all heavy guns on my Char the gatling gun and .50cal are the Best for every Day use, while the minigun and mg42 are really fun.
---
If you want to use an mg42 i suggest priming it. Yea you have to deal with fluxes but it's soooo Worth it ! 
---
Also the mg42 fires fast enough as it is, a 1* bloodied mg42 is really good in and off it self. I've got  a 
---
TS
---
TSE
---
AA FFR and
---
BL +10dwa prime mg42 
---
And the bloodied takes the cake for me. TS/TSE's add a Lot of recoil and spread and even the AA ffr is harder to controll.
---
I can tell you right now - it’s not gonna be. It’ll be just like every other update and new content they’ve released - short, disappointing, not what was promised, and full of bugs.
---
Put a ranger helmet from F1st and you'll get a tiny head xD
---
It'd help if you specify which platform you are on.
---
I can't link it directly, but try [here](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;ei=JHfOXZeFCoeyaqqFo7gF&amp;q=market76&amp;oq=market76&amp;gs_l=mobile-gws-wiz-hp.3..0j0i10l6j0i30.1495.3927..4255...1.0..0.128.878.7j2......0....1.......0..0i131j46i131j46.mhv0-Xfv4T0)
---
Cheers guys! Let's make the wasteland a better place and keep our community in unity!!!
---
Platform?
---
\&gt;funding the free dlc 
---
"Well if you aren't paying Bethesda how do you expect FREE dlc idiots?"
---
So the DLC is not free? Are we having to pay for it or not? Sarcasm aside, you really think they need the portions of money they have received in OVER A YEAR to create the content they promised us would be free?
---
Reality check: We have received 0 free dlc packs since launch. If all atom shop purchases were to fund free DLC, where is our free DLC from before Fallout 1st?
---
Keep telling yourself whatever suits your argument man, good luck.
---
well said, mate, I hope you'll join r/PKOA if you haven't already, I'm sure Red will love this story and your generosity 
---
Ngl, if I could afford it, I'd do it as well lol but alas I'm a student either way, it's really nice to see this :D see you in Appalachia!!
---
PC
---
 ...and pass the ammunition?
---
Ah dang sorry I’m on PS4, I’ve tons from SBQ fights. Best of luck.
---
:( thanks for the reply tho.
---
Automatics have much higher dps, semi auto or bolt action are good at one shots. Utilise sneak, sneak damage cards, crits etc.
---
???
---
That’s great!
---
Official mod support Bethesda has never patched their hames properly we need an unofficial patch.
---
I like going straight into fight instead of sneak. I like opening fights with sneak and then full on fight
---
The game would need a generated world map or a destructive constructed one based on some form of grid oder linear system. If you take examples like minecraft there it is pretty obvious because everything is generated into cubes. But there are also games like Life is Feudal etc that exactly have such systems that have a linear constructed world plane that has heigh and depth informations. The player can manipulate that with tools or hands and build different stuff into it. All of that is build upon some sort of raster or grid as i said earlier. All Bethesda Models are handcrafted unique assets. You cant "dig" like in minecraft and you cant place land masses exactly like every other game. That would need a complete redesign of every asset in this game. If you are not familiar with such games you can simply google "generated world maps" and you will find tons of examples
---
They should bite the bullet and make this game free to play, then it would be free to play online without a ps+ sub as well, give people who paid for the game 6 month fo1st sub.
---
More people would play and more people would spend money in the atom shop.
---
Win win
---
Most interesting thing about Wastelanders is whether it was already made when the game released, or not. Either way it will be a complete lack luster Wild Appalachia type tiny add-on. 
---
I personally think all of this was planned from the start by Bethie. Fallout 1st ***certainly*** was.
---
Yeah and it’s the same for the fermenter too I just found this out yesterday, had to delete my picnic benches out back 😂
---
It’s 6:24 pm now, when does it end? Or where can I find info about it?
---
Wow, never noticed that. 
---
I've just built a sweet new camp.... And I can't display anything not even my bobble heads because I'm maxed out budget, So frustrating.
---
Will leave my camp the same and hopefully we get an increase soon.
---
This is one of the reasons I'm thankful for survival as it was being gone. If we had the same rules as Nuclear Winter for gear and perks it would be a much different experience.
---
All five. They're lvl 226, lvl 155, lvl 147, lvl 97 and lvl 83.
---
I love CAMP building and originally started playing new characters to be able to build new CAMPs without destroying the old ones. Then you want all the plans for the new characters and then you need ok weapons and armor for them to be able to get that and so on...
---
That makes them kind of idetified by the CAMP. The 226 is the mansion in Whitesprings that have the big Power Armor garage. The 155 have a bar south of Morgantown, growing stuff and making alchohol. The lvl 147 have an IKEA selling all the CAMP plans and wood scrap, steel scrap and loose scrows. The lvl 97 have a small shopping center with a clothing store selling outfits and a weapons store selling ammo and perhaps a weapon or two. The lvl 83 has a road side garage/diner.
---
I had a good time with my non automatic build, but I felt significantly stronger when I switched over to automatic. Some guns it wasnt a huge difference. Others (like the railway rifle) suddenly felt like the greatest thing in the game compared to when they werenr auto
---
Then automatics are definitely the way to go. The non-automatic rifles only work if you stay undiscovered in sneak mode  - due to their low DPS but high single-shot damage you need the sneak damage bonus to one-shot mobs, otherwise you get swarmed and, uh, mobbed.
---
Then you’ll probably prefer an auto weapon with commando perks maxed for high DPS. Faster Fire Rate Handmades seem to be the meta for this build atm
---
I recently change from Rifleman to Commando as I only use my BE Handmade. 
---
Commando is much better, especially with Ground pounder for hip fire accuracy.
---
Love it
---
There is a budget because currently everything transfers between private world and public. They should just make it separate IMO. 
---
Anyway, yes the fridge is pointless, hence why it’s not P2W lol.
---
I’m not on ps4 but thought I’d let you know you chose a good time to come back. There’s a double cop event on at the moment, not sure when it ends though.
---
FYI they just reduced bobblehead weight by 90% so they shouldn’t take up nearly as much camp budget as they used to
---
It was suposed to be an RPG,but Beth screwed up.Well, at least the combat and gunplay are better than Fallout 3 and New Vegas at least.
---
No ripping on Game Freak?The community is  tearing into them and they deserve it. I think Beth deserves flak too.  They certainly deserve respect for their series but they don't think things through and often take the lazy route. They need to flesh things out more (like world building, bugs, monetisation and support) 
---
But if you compare Gamefreak and Bethesda they both are getting it hard and they deserve it.  Both tried popping out a rehash of their last game and they are not complete full games.  
---
I like fallout, Bethesda has a lot of controversies and the pressure from Zenimax  to monetise aggressively is actively hurting the good faith the built up. 
---
I hope they get it together and I hope they don't ruin Fallout 5.
---
They reduced the weight of them yes but they still take up a heap of camp budget. I have all 95 mags, all bobbleheads plus 10 weapons on display and I had to have a good cm of camp budget available to display them all.
---
Why is my post being downvoted? I thought everyone here was completely anti Bethesda. Is it because i subscribed to 1st? I always buy a premium of any game for 1 month. I unsubscribe to the shit ones like this lol
---
Double Xp event is through 12:00 EST on monday
---
No
---
I'm so, so very sorry for your loss. I know there aren't adequate words. I'm glad you have so many wonderful memories to keep close to your heart.  💜
---
Blame Sony and Microsoft
---
Unfortunately what the other guy said is true. Displaying stuff takes up so much room, stash weight isn't my issue.
---
&gt; When players are frustrated the developer has taken the approach of walking away and hoping that the frustration subsides. 
---
The radio silence is what pisses most dedicated fans off more than anything. It is either radio silence or lies no in between these days.
---
You can empty the ffr lmg's clip in about 3 seconds. Let that sink in.
---
If you care about anything other than feeding that beast of weapon, go with 50 cal.
---
&gt; Having to have ps plus to play 76 is so annoying
---
It is indeed.
---
Fuck Sony.
---
There’s a safe on top of Portside Pub, a tool box south of it as well. There’s also some safes along the monorail, under the pitches of the houses by Morgantown HS, a safe atop the bank in Morgantown as well. Just the ones I remember off the top o my noggin
---
Have you even played the game? Just because they didn’t waste time redesigning super mutants again doesn’t make it an “asset flip”.
---
\*Alex punches other kid in the face\*
---
"Oi you can't do that Alex go to your timeout corner" 
---
"But Tommy kicked the cat once why can he get away with that but I can't?"
---
Just because someone else did something wrong doesn't make it okay for someone else to do something just as egregious or worse. 
---
It just means Alex and Tommy are shit kids. 
---
pointing out that Tommy is also a shit kid when people are discussing Alex doesn't really do anything.
---
I ran rifleman for the longest time. Switched to commando and I love it. No comparison.
---
Oh nice I thought it was a single day thing. Time to grind.
---
Eh I think it gets hate above not being fallout 5.
---
Why? They deserve it just as much as any other game company. 
---
EA fans have a right to be mad at EA since they care about that company
---
Bethesda fans have a right to be made at Bethesda since they care about Bethesda. 
---
Its not really rocket science.
---
We were supposed to have a functional game at *launch*, and we still don't have that. Don't give Bethesda the benefit of the doubt that they will do anything other than what their Shareholders want at this point.
---
It takes up way less space now though since thy reduced weight. Reducing weight reduced camp budget they take up as well.
---
I want to know who downvoted my response lol. I went to Bethesda’s website to double check and yup, goes through Monday at 12
---
I'm not saying Bethesda should be excused. I'm saying that comparing these wrongdoings and the hate they generated shows that they're not proportionate.
---
If Jimmy gets a half-assed scolding while Alex is publicly executed before a live studio audience, something isn't right.
---
If you take each individually. But what about collectively as parts of an industry? How does Bethesda and the hate they got compare to other studios and publishers and their misdeeds?
---
TL/DR, “I don’t play anymore because other people on the internet are angry. I don’t know what they are angry about but I don’t want to play a game that makes other people write mean things on the internet webs”
---
Yo I thought someone died
---
R.I.P LeShire5K. I'm Sorry for your loss
---
Um the mutate thing 100% is a thing. Well it’s not so much that they need to mutate but you do need to wait for star/legendary name to appear, even if they are glowing. 
---
Ok these are two different things I guess. Never heard the mutate thing before.
---
Wait, animal friend or wasteland whisperer?? Is this why I can’t get it to work? Lol
---
You payed 7$ for the fridge? Heh, I got it for free.
---
Never mind the fact you can't put raw flux in it which is the only reason I bought the fucking thing.
---
“At least it’s better than a 10 year old game”
---
Ka-choonk!
---
Oh my.. Such foul language! You kiss your mother with that mouth? o_O
---
I’m deleting this as people for some reason are giving me a lot of negative karma, have fun with being non 1st plebs
---
Yes, I played the game of course, I bought it months ago, and I played Fallout 4 a couple hundred hours. Its an obvious asset flip sold at full price, now with subscription added in.
---
Did he actually destroy your base or did you have passive mode on?
---
Duplication bugs leaking irl now
---
Yeah, it looks about right
---
Yeah, i get that same bug i think imma call it, i’ve lost soooo many caps in PvP cause of that,
---
Man it's too bad his last memories were of playing this terrible game... You should sue Bethesda for damages. It's not right.
---
He's probably on about the recent ban wave where the creator of map76 and some people who have been finding glitches and reporting them to Bethesda for a while, got banned. Some/all I can't remember got permanent bans
---
Define “asset flip”?
---
And that subscription is for people who want 19,800 atoms and other feature outside the core game.
---
it's easier to just pay someone a few thousand caps to max one out for you with the best mods
---
Can you sum up your finding without making me click a link? One sentence will do. Thanks.
---
Sorry for your loss man that must be hard.
---
Are you the same guy that begged for ps codes a couple months back? Damn it's that ez huh
---
I’m not sure but I just upvotes both of your comments. I have noticed comments getting downvoted really quickly on fo76 subs.
---
For the Shire !!!
---
Commando seems alot deadlier, but man the ammo consumption is whats killing it for me
---
If they showed you pictures of the new weapons you would have like two weeks worth of content... Im not expecting more then 3 or 4 new weapons and another PA type... nothing more...
---
I'm looking for someone to Run vault raids with or drop some nukes n stuff. I'm on PC, lvl 230, GMT +1.
---
I'm a bloodied Power armor heavy gunner.
---
Eat eggs they are not meat or plant. It will be your only choice outside of dog food.
---
How under privileged with your PS4 and multiple Bethesda titles, buy one less game next time
---
First of all, profligate! Second get a job, if you're lucky you can get a under the table job and a advance for you ps plus membership in one day.
---
Bro I don't own those games, I used them as an example yo show just how many single players games id rather be playing then a multiplayer online game.
---
What? I've never posted anything about a plus code before.
---
Wow.
---
Suck up, brown-noser, sycophant, fanboy/girl.
---
When you get banned they tell you why. 
---
Mind sharing with the class?
---
Bethesda could get around that in one way.
---
Make the base game free.
---
Hi, I can run the vault with you. 
---
Pm, for IGN. 💕
---
But why do I need to look at the industry?  I like Bethesda, they're basically the only developer I follow closely.  They've made all of my favorite games, and I love the mawfakwers.  However, this shits fucked and I haven't even complained about it much.  And EA will always be the top dog for customer backlash, they got the worst for Battlefront.  And the outrage exists in an attempt to get change.  Maybe it won't happen but don't tell people who love these games to simmer down when Bethesda kinda made a shit garbage game.
---
I also got this game to play with my brother who lives so far away I only see him every few years. Sadly our co-op experiences haven’t been fairly stale. 
---
Much rather play this game single player sadly.
---
Use a PC
---
If they added a 10 second timer  before pvp begins when you start claiming an owned workshop, it would be a very different experience.
---
Currently if you even open the build menu in a workshop, you are a sitting duck. The absolutely needs to be a small delay between "there are intruders in your workshop" and a hail of bullets. I don't say this because I want people to be able to run away, I'm saying that a workshop where you can't use the build menu without dying is a big problem. (but people should have the option of running away from a workshop takeover if they don't want to fight).
---
Interesting. My auto build suffers horrid vats/head accuracy and my friend who mains a lever states the same. He has a private world (way less lag) and still misses head shots often.
---
I'm thinking that too
---
I’ve noticed that it has been a lot more stable on Xbox.
---
Yeah I discovered that a few hours after the destruction.
---
Yeah it's two different things, I've witnessed legendary enemies gaining stars.
---
Mutation is when the health goes back to full (as on Fallout 4 a message was prompted saying "Legendary enemy has mutated!"), back when I used to grind Whitesprings I had encounters with people telling me to let it mutate.
---
Ok, so, I've been combanned now twice in two days. I've never been banned for anything before. I was just chatting with friends, I'll screenshot the messages, they were definitely NOT bad messages at all! Literally just chatting. I wrote to xbox about it and the customer service rep said they're receiving reports of this happening all over. No idea why. 4 of my friends were all combanned all in the last 2 or 3 days.
---
Yea, but it was still the best scene in the movie. 
---
And the truth of your statement might be why Bethesda put the skeleton in the fridge in fallout 4.
---
GT is my username, I'm sometimes busy building epic camps when I find a good spot but happy to team up any other time.
---
Survival Mode was removed. It might be back next year, we don't know.
---
Fav was seeing a mothman for the first time. Horror was what they did with private servers.
---
Alright ok. Thank you 😄
---
I'm playing Nuclear Winter to get the rewards quicker and collecting a nice amount of XP in Adventure simultaneously.
---
Tbh end game is farming legendaries.
---
Raid items need a rework. PA should have increased steel and normal armor should have a different thing that can be farmed because of rng of crafting.  I did raids first week (novice, normal &amp; expert) and then it got boring. Mostly for server lagg stealing several minutes from a perfect run lol.
---
Remember adding ISS with the high dmg and after that ”the burrows” as end game group content lol.
---
Ammo isn't really an issue with player vending. You can vendor 1400 caps a day and people sell ammo for 1cap/per so 1400 is a lot of ammo.
---
Or you could farm it
---
Since it's apparently going to be instanced I don't see why they can't release a quest or two to at least give us something to do while we wait.
---
Does it say specifically why? Like, quotes the exact offence, whether it be a report from someone about you, or a message you sent?
---
Oh my god I saw this message in my inbox without context and was like "oh god what have I said to anger this person so much?!"
---
Thanks for the info, TIL
---
There are proper channels for dealing with this. This isn't it.
---
Post with Bethesda Support, maybe even put in a report with Twitch given that they have anti-cheating community guidelines for streamers.
---
Don't post crap like this here with names. It just makes you the arsehole.
---
Having to pay to use internet functions on consoles is and has always been BS and a scam
---
It was also removed weeks before 1st came about.
---
It was removed a few weeks before Fallout 1st so they could use those servers for the private Servers
---
Lol. I see what you mean now. Might have helped to quote you as well!
---
Have a good one mate :)
---
No one was wrongfully banned.
---
I can for the life of me not find anyone selling 5.56 ammo, or least not in the amounts i need, and the thought of having to spend 2 hours every other day to craft enough ammo is, well killing it for me.
---
It was a game mode hardly anyone played so they got rid of it. F1st might have had something to do with it as well
---
Block em, switch servers.  Maybe laugh in their face before you do so?   😉
---
Man, they can't even get postage right. Bethesda just cannot get a break.
---
Once again political correctness is more important, than dealing with the mass amount of hackers.
---
This isen't crap, and he's not the arsehole here...
---
Can we just have a whole bunker mini-game introduced into 76. Kind of like the the mobile vault we already have.
---
&gt;This isen't crap, and he's not the arsehole here...
---
are you blind?  the guy is shooting into the air with a minigun and getting kills.
---
That's not how the servers work at all.
---
Mr Fuzzy is your friend, Mr Fuzzy wants to play.....
---
I've got this twice in three days too! Second time was last night, no idea why!
---
Submit a ticket and hope for the best... to be honest they have the absolute worst customer service i have ever seen en even though we know they **can** restore in game stuff (they have done this) they claim it is not possible so... to be short they won't help you...
---
Contact support.  See if this is an option.
---
Was it? I remember playing Survival Mode quite near to the launch of Fallout 1st.
---
I realized what you were saying while I was typing and decided not to abort and write anyway haha
---
I love how money to pay office rents, salaries for developers and severs equal greed.
---
"Sorry guys, no paycheck this week, everyone did the challenges so we made no money. You will still stay on the project and work on Wastelanders, right?"
---
Is this real or just a one time bug?
---
It has been like that since beta. Why would it change?
---
add me on psn: Owl_No
---
Great guy ❤️
---
Yeah, that's insane
---
Only offended people downvote 🤡
---
In Reddit's own words:
---
["We all get outraged by the ignorant things people say and do online, but witch hunts and vigilantism hurt innocent people too often, and such posts or comments will be removed."](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-101/reddit-basics/reddiquette)
---
But sure, it's about political correctness over hackers...
---
Kindly remind you that F76 never was free 2 play and people already payed full price for it...
---
I will tonight, thanks man!
---
Then you sound go heavy gunner. One of my best choices was to go heavy instead of rife and man when your cranking out 200 damage a shot on a 50 with like the highest rate of fire in the game it feels good
---
I run heavy guns so I know the pain
---
I mean why are you complaining that some people are getting more than one bag? A little odd but ultimately it’s free stuff
---
*’But you can’t scrap Legendary Weapons or Armor, dude!’*
---
Either way, someone was going to be a Clark.
---
Done
---
add me on ps4: peronister
---
You have a good point and it would be pretty boring with less stuff to shoot.
---
I've played most days since the Beta. I'm always finding new stuff to see and do. Spawning into the Wasteland feels like coming home (queue the song...).
---
It's like the gaming equivalent of paying with exposure.
---
"Ah, I'm sorry Bethesda. Unfortunately, we don't have the budget for paying for Fallout 1st. How about you make the subscription earnable in-game and we pay you with game play".
---
Junkie's Explosive railway rifle with 90% reduced weight. Empties 10 shots in about a second and one or two of those takes out mostly everything short of a Scorchbeast, they'll take a couple more.
---
Kindly remind you that unlike offline games where what you buy is what you get, this game requires ongoing costs for server upkeep and added content which they don’t require a payment to access.
---
You can't blame Bethesda. Sony decided that to play most online games you have to have PS plus
---
I’ve now scraped over 2k and still have two mods unlearned. Ridiculous but at least I still have a reason to be excited about screws and adhesive.
---
They better add higher-tier rewards for those of us that didn't sit on our arses the first time around and then cry about missing it.
---
Considering I just restarted a new character, double experience is rather a neatly timed gift for me personally.
---
Look around. He is probably nearby. Or wait for meat pile to appear
---
I’d say you got really lucky with only two months. I’ve scrapped over 2k since March and still have two crucial mods to go...
---
It was removed weeks before fallout 1st FYI
---
It doesn't matter what the game require - I'm pretty sure they're not amateurs and calculated the costs BEFORE release of F76 so they've known what they've promised...
---
&gt; I mean why are you complaining that some people are getting more than one bag? 
---
I'm not. 
---
I'm pointing out even the most basic task of shipping out replacement bags is something Bethesda lacks the competency to deal with it without screwing up.
---
I will tonight!
---
I have started an new explorer character who's goal is to see everything. Not to focused on what quest to do, more a "Hey, what's over that next ridge?" kind of guy.
---
He missed those who left the game due to the monetisation scam.
---
You might need to adjust the sensitivity on your joke detection algorithm.
---
people have already paid to purchase the game. before the days of subscription services and paid extras the company would have only made money on the game from people buying it with no way of squeezing extra cash from people unless they made a second game. 
---
this isn’t a small group of indie developers it’s a billion dollar company and if you really think they won’t be able to afford to pay their staff because people don’t wanna subscribe to this bullshit fallout first thing then you’re on 10 different levels of corporate fanboy. this isn’t their only piece of work and it won’t be their last. the survival of the company isn’t directly hinging on how many people subscribe to fallout first they just want to make more money out of their fan base with minimal effort
---
I've been basically defrauded by Bethesda, what say you?
---
It’s possible they were planning something, but decided against it because of the community’s potential to make everything into a crisis.  It seems like any move they can possibly make is met with venom  and complaints, so the best option was to offer the least offensive thing possible.
---
Literally everyone likes xp, so I can see how it would appear to be a safe choice.
---
Yet here we are, complaining again.
---
I T J U S T W O R K S
---
They promised no paid DLC or season passes... have you had any quests, expanded map, etc locked behind a paywall? They told us back in August 2018 that if they add private servers it would be a separate service provided by Bethesda. You act surprised that they created a new product and ask you to buy it.
---
Stop begging for free stuff! I mean seriously this board is either hating or begging, it's so dull now...
---
There's a lot of posts about weapon holstering in fallout 4 and why it wouldn't work. If you check the mods for fo4 you can see there's weapons that act as clothing items that show on your character. I wish this feature was in th me game as well but unfortunately with all the clothing customisation and layers it won't work.
---
A Hero in our time of need. =D
---
Imagine having to pay to play the games you own.
---
If I knew what Bethesda would be doing I wouldn't have been there.
---
How about: "Don't defraud customers"?
---
The same happened to me with Black ops 4, except you literally cannot do anything whatsoever without ps plus. Except maybe zombies, but even that is severely limited. $60 game that you need another $60 to even play? Fuck capitalism.
---
Without sounding bad, why are you on console if you've got less? You'll probably find buying a cheap second hand computer alot cheaper in everyway. You can buy computers with decent specs for most games quite cheap these days
---
It would be if this guy hadn’t done the exact same thing a while ago under a different name. TheToddHoward or something like that. I fell for it and sent him a $10 psn code. I checked his profile after a saw a trade post and giving this as his psn name. I felt sorry for him as I’m a single mum but basically he’s a scammer. I’m out now so can’t look through my previous comments to find it.
---
Well played TheToddHoward. Scamming at its finest, you suckered me in and now someone else.
---
Auto health regen is bringing you back to your highest boosted HP level (I.e. vodka gives you +75 hp). It’s being triggered by using both speed demon and adrenal reaction mutations, specifically a speed demon negative effect (since when you suppress SDs negative effect the regeneration ends).
---
What's even more annoying is having to plat F76 at all.
---
I'm not surprised they ask me to buy it, I'm only deny that they won't give their employees paychecks if we won't pay for the subscription...
---
Did you have them in a display? I think it might use loose junk in the stash for crafting first before it uses stuff from the scrap box. I've had it happen to me too. I don't know for certain but it seems like that's what's happening. I may actually test it this weekend (unless someone posts in this thread that they've already tested it) ✌️
---
What are you talking about?
---
Where will money come from without ongoing revenue?
---
From full price everyone had to pay to play F76
---
now you can put one on each foot when it rains to keep your feet dry.
---
Shoutout to those who read this far into comments to see how long until someone points out that “today” was misspelled.
---
Honestly, PS+ and Xbox live are even more bullshit than FO1st which is why I stopped using consoles after PS stopped providing free live service.
---
You have to pay for internet to pay for the online games that you pay a subscription to get the complete package for. To me its like a Dell computer coming out and saying, "you want internet for your internet you have to pay for it".
---
The idea of 1st is unethical on Bethesda's part but not so bad for PC- however its extremely unfair to console gamers.
---
This happens to me and I don't have speed demon
---
Scammer.
---
So apparently having the same username as some other dude as his psn name makes me a scammer. I have no fucking clue who the hell TheToddHoward is and my psn name isn't even the same my psn is akt6845 and you can add me to find out. Darkshadow is a very common name for people that don't want to put there real name on the internet. Really upset I need to defend myself over someone else.
---
After the constant screw ups by bdthesda and the banning of peoe like eckserahs even though he didn't break the TOS makes me believe those who claimed they were innocent in that ban wave. I mean if they can screw up and ban the person who literally found and reported the exploit people were using to steal accounts? Why would I not think the same thing happened to some of those caught in the ban wave then. 
---
I mean it is obvious they can't detect duping otherwise there wouldn't have been people a couple weeks ago doing "public duping giveaways" where they aould dupe shit for anyone playing on the server and have been doing it for a while.
---
People are building under the map already, might as well make a system for it 🤔
---
You're legit crazy!!?? I've never spoke with you in my life and where in my post did I ever say "someone give me plus" I was stating how ridiculous it is to be paying for the right to play your own game and have a discussion about it. Also TheToddHoward also commented on this post too. So what that me too??
---
ESO has the same type of subscription. Same company doing same thing in a different game. Why would you expect any thing different?
---
I would think if you had a list of plasmas, lasers, and flamers, and put Explosive in the name that would be it wouldn't it? Why would a list be needed? 🤔
---
You will not lose it, but serum will be wasted.
---
Can confirm.  Source - have run hundreds of silos in many different combinations.
---
Bethesda didn't like that.
---
Money paid last year was spent last year lol. You understand that if there are continued costs they need continued revenue to pay for them right? If they stop getting revenue it means they need to either a) get new revenue or b) cut costs (shut off servers, stop developing new content.
---
Damn...
---
Love Ian McCollum! You should check out The Armourer's Bench on YouTube if you haven't already. He covers really neat rare firearms aswell. He's like Ian's British counterpart. In fact Ian made a guest appearance on one of his newest videos!
---
any energy weapon + explosive (laser, plasma, flamer, gauss, cryo)
---
.50, gatling with double/quad
---
double/quad blackpowders (not 100% about this last set)
---
I'd like to see double atom weekends.
---
You do realize that many players quit game, but didn't "take" their money back while still new players buys game and pay for it more than few months subscription cost?
---
Sounds like problem is on you lol
---
Big F
---
Oh come on we’re talking about the same game and the same company that announced Fallout 1st to commemorate October 23rd, quite a significant date in the Fallout world. Talk about shallow, I’ve stepped in deeper puddles.
---
Ughh no that was me. I was the guy a few months ago literally asking if anybody could help out? I did it out of just pure love of the game and wanting to keep playing it. Didn't realize you thought that little of me...
---
Vats uses the chance to hit from when you press fire. If you're using a charge up weapon and start charging when it's at 30% and then release when it hits 95% you will still only have a 30% hit chance.
---
pull'em our yer ass like the rest of us! no need for fancy stick holders!
---
You can add items to leveled lists at runtime from within a Papyrus script.  It's highly unlikely in this case, but not 100% impossible.
---
They've phoned it in since day 1.
---
I can’t even get into NW
---
Well deserved hate.
---
That luck helps you get better drops from Murmurgrr. My friend has a pet theory that carrying a certain type of legendary prefix makes Murmurgrr give you that prefix. So you want quad handmade, bring as many quad weapons as possible in your inventory. Seems a little crazy to me(don't tell him I said so) but he swears it works for him!
---
Not for those of us already above level 250. Got every perk and at least 50 levels of xp left to spend. They’re also assuming such high level players will be still be around to report the bugs with the legendary perk system when it eventually lands.
---
Explosive perk on energy weapons is the obvious on, but perks like double/Quad on particular weapon types?
---
I follow the sub in the hopes of hearing news good enough to get me to reinstall the game.  I have had little good to say about 76 (bar the community which is generally awesome and much nicer than most), but I still want 76 to bounce back and become the solid, expansive, time consuming,living world Fallout game I had hoped it would be.
---
Have you done any research? There are a huge number of reasons why people are mad at bethesda. They lied about cosmetic microtransactions and tried making mods payable on steam and added microtransactions into wolfenstein Youngblood a single player game, they gave people nylon bags and YouTube people real canvas bags that was disgusting as well
---
How do you know they don't? Goats are pretty to some people
---
I am a capitalist, I truly am but one thing I noticed it lacks is that it sometimes fails to encapsulate why humans enjoy a content - a piece of art, painting, music or controversially video games - and it just tries to cash in on it. This is exercised by greedy motherfuckers, bethesda being one, by cashing in on a franchise, or an artist, that is loved by many to increase their profits and to show a monthly steady income for their corporation. Now, I still believe a little amount of devs working there and maybe some upper managment lads still have passion for the IP. Its a long shot at this point coz paychecks are better than ideals, but it is still worth a shot. I believe social media has the power to change things for good and we have seen that happening many times before, from politics to company policies. 
---
Especially after the new Sonic trailer, which is miles better that the shitshow they published weeks ago and is a really fucking huge deal if we are talking about production budget, I believe if we keep this mockery going maybe we can show these idiots that yes, their long time profits could be in trouble if they don't abandon this awful fallout game (and a mediocre game at best) or fix it (which is nearly impossible, 15 fps is the norm for PS4). 
---
I have quarter of a thousand hours clocked in btw, stopped after fallout first announcement. if you are to postpone wastlenders, you also postpone the service that was aimed to launch with it you greedy fucks.
---
It's not THE worst but it's in my top 10 at least.
---
I’m a dunce.  I initially thought LeShire5K had just quit the game and I kept thinking “why are these people being so melodramatic?”.  It took me an embarrassingly long minute before I realized he must have died IRL.  Sorry for your loss.
---
Of course you're ok with waiting. You've defended this trainwreck since day one. You should honestly work for Bethesda PR.
---
I did the same. Going for a VATS commando this time.
---
Unless sales are steady they need additional revenue sources. Games typically had majority of their sales at launch lol. I hope you aren’t a business owner lmao
---
My non automatic rifle build hits between 2k and 4k per shot.  That pretty much one shots everything in the game except for the Queen and squatches.
---
 I have never liked automatic weapons so I probably will never switch.
---
I think a lot of people are just disappointed.
---
I have nothing to spend caps on aside from ammo. I’m happy with xp.
---
People often forget neon baseball bats also used to be a thing.
---
i think that is sweet that he despised this game but still played it so he could do something with you :D
---
So they decided not to make good content because community might be mean? Here's an idea. Make actual decent content. There is an infinite amount of suggestions from community. Why are people so willfully blind.
---
My guess would be a split of haters having a say even after quitting and those who’ve quit and are waiting for the grass to come back greener and thicker. Clearly the haters being the group that those who are waiting are getting lumped into it seems and making all who have quit over the year look bad as hate mongers and rage baiters.
---
Right, we're all upset about Kraft/Heinz, but what about Nabisco? Look at what they're doing!
---
Wastelanders is being delayed because I'm sure they want to figure out how to monetize it. Almost want to bet money on it.
---
It’s double XP weekend. You can fly through levels right now.
---
14 to 50 isn’t like a 1 day thing. You’re talking about like a week long commitment of several hours a day from someone basically dedicating all their time exclusively to gaining XP.
---
People in this sub get so salty over anything pvp related it’s pathetic.. guys literally just asking about survival mode and what happened and your downvoting him.. yous are the problem with this community! 
---
Sorry for the mini rant dude, yeah survival was taken away about a month before the release of private servers, there reasoning was that “no one plays it” so they wanted to turn their attention to wastelanders.. however one month later private servers did take there place.. so who knows if it was really just play on BGS part to ensure they weren’t running wayyy to many servers...
---
[For those who want live action of this beauty, presented by gunnery sergeant R Lee Ermey.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w16pXWL2B2k&amp;feature=emb_title)
---
God if that is true, just another pay for convenience. Would be irritating a difficult situation. Sounds like Beth lol.
---
You wont be able to to eat any meat or plants
---
Lol no just getting overhyped isn’t my personal preference. I like to experience new content all at once. If they start sharing a bunch of stuff now there will be nothing we don’t know about by the time the content actually drops. If you hate this game so much, why are you here?
---
I'm sure you're not a business owner (too much lols and lmaos in your posts). If BGS would had released solid game and minimize all the fuckups and fix most of problems, I'm pretty sure there would be more players buying game resulting in higher revenue. It's their fault, not ours, that the game is in the state as it's now...
---
After the fixes today everything seemed really laggy. Before that my game ran pretty good.
---
I actually am a business owner. I didn’t realize laughing at the absurdity of your argument affects my business acumen.
---
So the solution is minimal effort double XP. Ok guy we'll get over ourselves. Does that involve a subscription?
---
I take it you didn’t enjoy the Pioneer Scouts challenges, Biv and fermenting dlc, the Sheepsquatch, taxidermy quests, Project Paradise, Encryptid quest line, Nuclear Winter, the Burrows, Vault 96, the Fixer, the bear arm, Sheepsquatch weapons, the Purveyor or anything else added to the game for free?
---
Of course you're downvoted for a perfectly valid point.
---
I’m going to have to use this response haha
---
Put this under the wrong post 😂😂😂
---
Yeah I'm the guy oohopeoo was talking about. I put a post up awhile ago asking for help and tbh I feel so low that I did. But you're literally just trying start a discussion which I agree it sucks you have to psy twice
---
I’m also “old” and enjoy the challenges. I spend most of my time exploring the wasteland and is just something fun to do on the side and earn some atoms. I’ve earned ~10,000 atoms so far.
---
&gt;There still is a very loyal fan base of gamers that really enjoy the game &amp; that support shows on here
---
There still is a very disappointed formerly fan base of players that would love to enjoy the game &amp; show support for it but cannot in good conscience.
---
It's these people (not all the haters) that try and push Bethesda to do better &amp; call them out when they don't.
---
These are people you do not want to lose because once they're, you're likely not going to see them ever again.
---
Something to consider OP.
---
The private worlds are the "single player" servers, they are just adventure mode with the soft limit on the player count reduced from 24 to 1. The game was not designed to be playable offline, it would not be fully functional without a server, so I doubt an offline mode would be made available in the near future. At most I can see Fallout 1st being discounted at the launch of Wastelanders to promote new sales of the game, for example by giving 1 month or week of free subscription to anyone who buys FO76 in the first week.
---
That's my goal but it's been weird because I don't know much about PCs 😅
---
Are you saying my dream weapon, the Q/FFR/FR The Dragon, doesn't drop anymore? I wanted to collect a handful of them and fill my weapon wheel with these...
---
There will be, just need to wait till x mas first xD
---
Vermin Rifle was great fun, would love to have it
---
2h melee weapons do lots of damage, but are slower than 1H.   
---
I prefer 1H in that they can do more damage in the same amount of time - for example, a grognak or all rise does about 180 base per swing.  (with martial arts, incisor, and glow sight maxed, no chems or performance boosting food, bobbles, or magazines.)
---
I use ballistic weapons against things that fly, so I do not have twisted muscles or talons mutations.
---
1\* vampire switchblade (serrated) does 80, but hits 3x in the same time it takes others to hit once.  3x8=240 vs 1x 180 = 180.   Power attack, switchblade does about 400.   
---
Subjectively, if I go to WS golf club with an allrise or gognak, I die, b/c the weapon is too slow to deal with the mob.  Even in PA.
---
Switchblade, I easily survive.  As a result, I have used that switchblade as a primary weapon for about 90 levels.
---
Backup is an L45 Gutter modded for electric charge.   W/ a power attack, it will 1 hit a L40 moleminer.  
---
I've toyed with unarmed (deathclaw gauntlet, mainly), but dont have the right perks loaded.  The V DCG does a boatload of damage per hit, but my armor isn't good enough; those MMiner shotguns deal a lot of damage. Going after a group of supermutants with automatics or miniguns is out of the question.  Cant get near them.
---
Hey apparently I'm you. Go figure??
---
That person doesn’t sound like they want a competitive PvP match.  They just sound like a bored dickhead looking to irritate someone.
---
Welp, we got some games with a really better combat than 76 back then!
---
??
---
haha wow yes, yes you did! Take a silver as recompense and a thank you for the double xp!
---
Dogmeat!!!! Make him chill at my camp while playing with others then when i play solo bring him along (agreed no combat so no advantage).....love this idea
---
As far as I know double / quad never dropped for black powder or heavy weapons, almost ironically tbh considering how imbalanced they let tse be from the get go. But yes my furious dragon is totally feasible, speaking of those I haven't had one drop for me in a long time.
---
Most people accept that the Bethesda we knew is dead and that Bethesda is currently a EA rip off butchering and killing its games, fans, reputation. The modding community is mostly all that is left of the older games. Its just sad for me to see Bethesda like this
---
Then what happens when the optional boss at the end of wastelanders DLC is just as strong as the scorch beast Queen or stronger, how are you going to fight it?
---
You litterally have to walk everywhere. You cant be huuuuuuge
---
All true. No idea why you are down voted for it.
---
I have a mg42 how much can I buy the prime plan for?
---
Reading the comments, this company can do absolutely nothing to please some fans.
---
I do that on my main. At one point I had 12 tents all fully decorated and was still only using maybe 75% of the budget
---
WOuld be cool if we could a small buildable instanced area (like POE) that we could enlarge for a set cap cost. Would be a great cap sink!
---
Legendary dragons still drop, double was removed a long time ago from legendary pool for all weapons, but was possible to obtain double heavy weapons on the beta, i've seen double 50 cal and gatling plasmas on pc, not sure about the rest
---
I just tore down my weapon dealer shack to upgrade to a pharmacy. 
---
I think the thing that most people really enjoyed was the indoor/outdoor firing range.
---
I am surprised your business partners accepts such infantile lols and lmaos. As for absurds - I see it completely different way - in my opinion your arguments aren't solid and I'm right. ¯\(ツ)/¯
---
That's interesting, but how do you know this for sure? People come out with these crazy quirks of the game and like, how did this get determined and how did this get proved? I used to use a gauss and I'll be dead honest I rarely if ever charged it (who has time for that) and the thing couldn't hit the broad side of a barn in VATs regardless lol. I honestly think something is fucked up with VATs. I wouldn't have made this post if I missed 10 times in a row once. It happens during certain play sessions on almost every enemy, and using 5-10x more ammo than I need is unacceptable. I like to play, not have to farm ammo to keep up with all the walls that swallow my bullets!
---
Get it all the time my ass....
---
I want to be like a polar bear, burning my fat reserves as I make my way through the wilderness.
---
I believe it is any heavy weapon with Double or Quad.  
---
Any weapon with Double  
---
Any Energy Weapon with Explosive (Including Gauss and Radium)
---
Am I in a abusive relationship
---
where was this said? can you link!
---
Balance it enough so that it is do-able solo
---
You can have whatever opinion you want. If you tried to operate a business like you suggest you’d be out of business. There are plenty of failed business people out there, so you aren’t alone.
---
Why?
---
Automatic. Hands-down, automatic. Not even a leg to stand on for non-auto or any sort of comparison required.
---
Automatic is in a league of its own while non-auto is trying to figure out where to park the car in the stadium's car park.
---
Those dupers never stop
---
That sounds majestic as fuck
---
JonasBOT 2000 not jonaaBOT 2000
---
Aparenlty there salty I grefed em🤷‍♀️
---
I just wanted to add I have been playing this game since fallout 1st came out and I honestly love it. I have had no game breaking bugs or really any issues at all. I love being in my own desolate world. I love scavenging and just being in the world of fallout. I’m also a big fan of West Virginia..as it reminds me of the Tennessee mountains I grew up in. I know this isn’t a popular take but it’s my honest opinion. I plan on upgrading to the years worth of fallout 1st next month. Wish more could enjoy it !
---
Me too. Also happened a few times already. Nothing missing.
---
If they added meat week, the sub would explode with complaints........again.
---
Dont worry about it mate. These idiotic shills wont be reasoned with. They're norons
---
Raiders are sneaky bastards.
---
Don't expect them to play fair even if you are doing them a mercy by providing a quick release the from the grip of the hive mind.
---
Tricksies they are I tell you, tricksies to their last breath.
---
So true.  The sub is full Goldilocks.
---
Never heard of you
---
That's not how weapons in Fallout 4 (and 76) work.
---
All the guns consist of modular pieces modeled to go together. You'd just need to combine the right pieces the way they already do. E.g. there aren't hundreds of variations of the 10mm pistol. It's *one* gun that has many individual modular meshes that combine into one model.
---
Doing for holstered weapons would be easy because Bethesda doesn't distinguish between world and hero assets for weapons. Every weapon you see on your character is the exact same model when dropped, just without its skeletal data. It
---
We are all hoping for Wastelanders (?)
---
That seems like a lot of development work to cater to people who don't want to play online on an online game.
---
 This game was specifically designed and made to be played online with other people.
---
 I think you will be waiting until fallout 5 to get what you wish.
---
12!? I have 3, a vault Tec canopy and my survival tent I managed to place in the boundaries
---
I refrain from commenting for the most part but I have a literal wall of Fallout related memorabilia and have LOVED the franchise for 21 years. I follow because I still hold out hope that someone with a real vision for what a multiplayer Fallout will seize control of F076 and right the ship.
---
I've already said my piece regarding live services and microtransactions so I have nothing more to add on the controversy other than to say that $15 a month should include everything or GFY.
---
I wasn't even counting the glass dome, 2 small canopies, and 1 large
---
Aha, eat my ass
---
This, all of this. I'm down. Let us know a time and date. Should do it across all platforms.
---
So that is where mine went.....
---
Snallygasters are considered a cryptid, butchers bounty only works with animals so ragstags, Brahmin etc..
---
&gt;It is universally agreed upon that this game is buggier a year later than most other games are at launch
---
I guess I'm the un-universal voice in that -- I've honestly not hit that many bugs at all. Or maybe years of Bethesda RPGs has rendered me immune to them -- like I sometimes get stuck at workbench or cooking station and have to go to the map to exit, and I've seen some ghouls sliding along underground, but that's about it. 
---
But I'm also enjoying the game for what it is, rather than in-spite of it. I dunno -- good summary -- I just feel like the game works fine for me and I'm not playing it worrying about the state of it or what's coming next. More content would be cool, but that's not my reason for playing right now.
---
There are also assaultrons heads that don't irradiate user.
---
They don't have meat do they? I don't think it works on Grafton monsters, Flatwoods monsters, or Mothman either. Probably a crypted thing.
---
The best you could possibly hope for is for them admit they overshot and to reduce the number of players on the public adventure servers. I'm sure they have enough data now to see that the game runs smoothly with 8 player cap on private and generally runs fairly poorly with 24 on public especially if they are all in the same place. So maybe they could decide to reduce the adventure servers to 16 players at a time. I doubt they will since it will take away some appeal from their premium service, but it would be nice.
---
why not play a good game?
---
https://crappygames.miraheze.org/wiki/Asset_Flipping
---
""Asset Flipping" is a term that refers to the practice of building a game almost entirely out of pre-made assets with little original work. They are more commonly found on SteamAGW being sold for cheap prices. Valve CorporationAGW refers to asset flips as "Fake Games"."
---
And that subscription is a slap in the face to fans. What you call "features" were part of all other Beth games for free in the past. They decided to make the game multiplayer and then have the nerve to ask for money monthly to play single player. Its incredible that people fall for this disgusting sham.
---
Budget wise it sounds like a tent showroom but I still wanna visit
---
Let me just say what a HUGE pain this would be for the programmers of the game (coming from someone who knows just a tad about programming) fallout 76 has 145 +/- weapons now let's say each weapon has, for sake of simplicity, 5 diffrent mods you can do and at least one alternative skin so in order to be able to show it on your player they would have to code in 1450 diffrent holstered weapons now that's if every weapon only had one skin and 5 mods now a weapon like the pipe bolt action has 48 diffrent mods so in order to code that one gun if we don't include skins 1,712,304 (If I did my math right I feel like I didn't) diffrent gun to sling over your back
---
Now that would be so dooooope 🔥🔥🔥
---
This is exactly why fo4 literally saved my life. It gave me the chance to escape from the hell in my head and life, to find a reason to keep fighting.
---
Comparing different pieces of shit is all well and good but you're still just looking at shit.
---
Justifying Bethesdas shit behaviour with shit behaviour of other companies is a total cop out.
---
This sub cracks me up.
---
Who said the meat hook doesnt get the 3x sneak attack? I hit her for 3.15x with calmex....with both my meat hooks, powerfist stays in the stash.
---
I’d assume many just wanna troll or tell new people what’s bad.
---
Most are probably actual fans of fallout and continue to follow to see if any substantial changes are made to the game
---
I get glowing meat from them all the time. Probably you are right about the cryptid thing :)
---
how many new players are there at this point?
---
I'm on xbox - Basedp0tat0. If you want a new buddy to game with, I'd be more than happy to team up.
---
Or vehicles like motorbikes or cars. Not gonna happen folks.
---
Weird that it works on scorchbeasts but not snallys
---
People saying it’s $100/m REQUIRED to play. 
---
Yes I heard that before.
---
Scorchbeast aren’t considered a cryptid, that’s why!
---
I reckon if you kill the queen enough you'll get the plans for free eventually. I think some vendors sell it, try phoenix in watoga or grahm if you can, find him. If they don't have it, try the Ash heap, cranberry bog and savage divide train stations. If they don't have it, players are your best bet
---
Don’t worry, Bethesda will release a patch fixing the dupe glitch.
---
Attention, that's it.
---
It's like buying a car. You have an upfront cost and then you need to pay for maintenance and gas.   
---
Most companies are like, "You pay for all of these if you want, each time they come out" (like Diablo expansions, Destiny expansions, Borderlands, etc).   
---
Bethesda is more like, hey you bought our car and we will repair it for free! But if you want you can give us a monthly detailing service and we will throw in some air fresheners, give you a better car trunk, and repaint your car! Also, you can have your own garage!  
---
Both need money, but both go about it in a different way. You cannot expect something that runs for a long time to not need upkeep, you sure as hell can use it but you will not see any improvements.
---
Ok so this game does not fit the description of asset flipping then...
---
Actualy I had quite the opposite situation while i was playing, when I turn on VATS first second would guarantee 95% and afterwards it was lower, so i always shot the first second, but i didnt miss any of my shots, i don't think I ever missed 95% i just cant remember..
---
While I'd like to see more gun variety in the game - I'd also like to see the current weapons balanced.  The lever action rifle is the best all round weapon in the game.  The black powder rifle - not the gauss rifle - has the most damage per shot.  This is unrealistic and ridiculous.
---
the power fist hits for 3.5x not 3.0
---
Sure, if you say so.
---
Jim wouldn't use whataboutism to deflect criticism though so if OP is a fan of Jim he's not been paying attention to his vids
---
Yeah, pretty much all of those things recieved outrage. It feels like Bethesda is getting more because we hang around fallout related sites. 
---
And anyway, even if they are getting too much rage, GOOD! Don't cut them a break because they're not AS bad, double down and make an example of them. More and more companies are trying to pull this shit, it's about time the customers made an example. The funny thing is, its us who have all the power. If we would actually vand together to hurt their bottom line, they'd all change their tune quick enough. But that will never happen.
---
With a bloody melee meathook build and a footlocker worth of drugs and booze, you can solo the queen
---
I'm gonna run around and absolutely ＳＬＡＹ everything in his name now. Also may he rest in peace...
---
I know on Fallout 4 if you connected your phone to the app + console you could play the games on your phone. We need that again!
---
I wanted an actual camp and not just some giant empty building. Everything was set up in a big circle around the edge of the build space. 
---
Not sure it works anymore but I used to be able to build up and decorate each tent than do the carpet blueprint trick and you could push them out a little passed the border. Can't move anything outside the build area once it's down but it did give a little extra room. 
---
Got bored with it though and tore it down last week. Now I'm building something similar. I'm up to 3 domes, 3 large canopies, and 5 tents. Still have plenty more room though. Probably do 4 more tents I think.
---
Edited to add a few examples. I could go on if you really need me to. Sounds like you don’t play the game and just regurgitate tired talking points without actually understanding the game at all.
---
Whataboutisms are not helpful.  Objectively bad and dishonest are still terrible even if there might be someone out there doing it worse.
---
Oh. Glowing meat is like an extra thing that glowing creatures have. It doesn't work with butchers bounty. I don't think a lot of people realize that snalygasters are crypted. 🤔
---
i believe so, since i have not seen any since they got rid of double heavys, but i have not seen a datamine for an exact yes/no
---
Hows that
---
Mine are very densely packed with decoration and furniture, with posters etc all over the back wall which is taking up my budget. I'd be really interested to see what you're describing if youre on PS4 or have screenshots or something?
---
Here's to actual camps
---
Happens to me here and there because I play on two Xboxes. Sounds like your on PC though so I am not sure how it relates. For me I think it's more of an Xbox live thing unrelated to the game. 
---
Your lost weapons are probably due to how roll back works when your dropped from a server.  Like when you drop a bag it saves that instantly but if you pick something up it doesn't. I have lost some decent legendaries this way transferring from one account to the other when a server goes down.
---
if you don’t buy it, no one will know
---
MG42 must be crazy in Pvp?
---
You want cranberries. There are about 10 at a farm in the top left corner of the map. Or if you go South from Watoga train station you will run across a mirlurk queen. In that water where she comes out there are a lot of cranberries. Oh and in the ares with the big pink plants.
---
this game is quite open, you can do quests, farm loot to build/sell/craft, explore etc... 
---
i will provide some equipment for you
---
1 was unbanned, 2 were perma'd, 1 has still gotten no response. 
---
The 1 that was unbanned and 1 of the perma'd people are in pretty similar situations as far as cheating, reporting exploits, etc.
---
It's a good comparison, but one thing is different - if I buy car that is faulty and producer will assure me that it'll fix it soon, while it's been a year and I got mostly air refreshers, he shouldn't be surprised I'm not going to pay more to maintain that faulty car. The car I can sell (and get some money back), but with broken game it's more difficult - I can either continue playing (with hope something will change) or quit (no money back). But no matter what I'll choose, I won't pay more money to producer...
---
I love giving stuff to new player xD help me get rid of plans I know and ammo xD
---
My fix would be that the other player has to “register” a claim to take the workshop which then gives the owner the option of not contesting the claim. No contest, you lose the workshop but don’t go into pvp mode. Decide to defend and you keep the workshop but now you know you are being hunted. 
---
This would allow non pvp players to finally start using workshops again. It would also force pvp players to have to actually work for a kill rather than pick off easy targets just trying to build a resource collector.
---
eh it has at times, especially around launch it worked. The latest stuff to me feels like it is coming from higher up and some outrage won't impact it as much unless they see a financial difference and not just a PR one
---
did you even read my comment? go to agility and equip the card "Covert Ops" and "Ninja" and your melee sneak attacks with unarmed weapons will go to 3.5x.
---
 this DOES NOT WORK on the meat hook. try it with a power fist.
---
Not to be crabby but there is already a post in the "hot" section I just read that puts most loyal Fallout fans thoughts perfectly.  Maybe check that.
---
LOL!!
---
Oh Bethesda will add it alright. For just 12$ a month , you can have the complete Courier set consisting of a full cosmetic set and a back holster!
---
I just had a pink bat drop yesterday. I don't think they are legacy.
---
I thought you meant he finally gave up on the game because all the shit Bethesda has put us through
---
I got a double gatling gun back in January or February. I think my buddy has it on his mule.
---
Where are the positive comparisons? 
---
* Path of Exile and Grinding Gear Games has critics about their investors, but they made a great game and did monetization right. 
---
* The Witcher series from CD Projekt Red is amazing. Compare FO76 to that. Wow. 
---
* Factorio is the #2 rated game on Steam. No shenanigans. Development continues years beyond the minimum viable product. 
---
* Company of Heroes by Relic and its successors have been high quality. 
---
* Star Control 2, a top rated game of all time, was released to further development for free under the Ur-Quan Masters project. 
---
Even within many of the negative examples (e.g. Blizzard), many gamers could play Overwatch or HotS for a long time without running into the bugs and controversies that are a daily occurrence with FO76.
---
Brill thank you. The farm at the top left of the map, would that be the Groves family cabin or the Aaron homestead?
---
It's a subscription because they told us there would be a subscription for the private servers back in August of last year.
---
Have you tried prime? You get a lot more ammo than say regular .308 crafting.
---
Yeah I read your comment did you read the perk card? Covert ops - “ranged sneak attacks....”  melee isnt ranged.
---
I still play it. I still enjoy it. But that's mostly because my opinion of the game isn't swayed by reading other people's opinion about the game. The echo chamber around here is real.
---
Most annoying part of this game is that some fallout players are just douchebags. Guy destroy most of my camp just because he could or walking by and three or four just start shooting at you. I'm level 50+ this dickheads are 200+ I just log off every time, so annoying.
---
Double prefix on weapons
---
Explosive:
---
Gauss
---
Radium
---
Laser
---
Ultracite laser
---
Flamer
---
Cryolator
---
Gatling Plasma
---
Gatling Laser
---
Tesla rifle
---
Maybe plasma rifles although I have never seen one.
---
Survival weapons, although they may bring these back.
---
I may be missing a few but I think this is most of them.
---
Nothing to be ashamed of either, who gives a fuck how someone else enjoys spending their free time
---
It's still the feature from Fallout 3 I miss the most. It even made binoculars useful if you could see what a group of enemies ahead of you are carrying. 
---
Plus, how else can I walk around dressed as a Ranger without a Big Iron on my hip?
---
Only would be available to fallout 1st members though lol
---
ha, and... ow... my poor heavy gunner. What's worse is he carries a lot of guns.
---
I believe they solved the lose your character bug at least. I've done a couple raids on a private server to get away from the lag issues.
---
I got fairly lucky early on, but it took me probably around 400-500 each to unlock the last 2. I almost gave up on the Tweaked reciever and compensator.
---
The Homestead one. It's kinda south east of were you spawn if you fast travel there. There should be ghouls and bugs roaming around where the cranberries are.
---
There's going to probably be 100 new bugs in Wastelanders because they gotta rush for their next check instead of just fixing something for ONCE!!!
---
I’m not sure that’s true, plenty of posts here are people enjoying the game. Though some things do seem to be very common (perhaps echo chamber) opinions, such as “this game has many bugs” or “there has been limited content releases in the last 6 months”
---
I can help but I wont ne ready for about 15 minutes yet.
---
equip that card with ninja and prepare to be amazed.
---
I'll never understand how that was in older Bethesda games but was removed after Fallout 4.  Especially with weapon modding being a thing now.  Why would I not want to have my baby displayed on me?
---
Commando has a higher dps but it consumes a lot more ammo.  I use the old tried and true rifleman perk set up with an instigating lever action.  You can one shot 80 pct of the enemies in the game with sneak shots.  I have a plasma rifle with the flamer barrel I use for the tanky enemies.  I like to run SBQ and pick off all the ground enemies so the high dps players can concentrate on the queen. Once she gets down to 1/4 health I run over and let her have it with the plasma flamer.  I usually sneak a few vats head shots in on the queen early in the fight as well just in case someone wipes her out quickly.
---
Long story short I hate scavenging for ammo so I run a semi auto build. .45 is pretty common and you can get it from player vendors for 1 cap apiece. 1000 rounds lasts a long time with this build.
---
Perfect, cheers mate much appreciated.
---
The Groves in the Bog also have healthy cranberries, and random encounters.
---
We just started sorry :(
---
Is that those weird pink droppy trees? I've never noticed cranberries in there before. I'll take a closer look next time I'm online thanks
---
I saw a really nice camp set up at Wilson Brothers auto repair in the Forest region. It already has a garage and a house.  You could use the majority of your budget for decorations if you picked that area.  The enemies that spawn there are low level so you should have to waste much of your budget on turrets.
---
It's all good. If you can't complete it with the amount of people you have let me know. I can recruit some more people probably.
---
I'm going to go against the grain here and suggest non-auto.  And why, you ask? Because heavy weapons are automatic, and use a different special stat. 
---
Use the lever action to take out a few baddies, then go heavy for cleanup. No card flipping necessary. A great combo. 
---
While a executioners ffr handmade is pretty wild, it is not equal to a lmg. And I have an lmg.
---
Yellow and light blue don't drop if I remember correctly. They phased out some colors that were basically leftover files from fallout 4
---
Okay.
---
Scorchbeasts are technically animals, a bat.
---
No problem.
---
No doubt. Walls and roofs are for suckers that like to bitch about budget restraints. Now I just have to find a spot big and flat enough where I won't have to use floors either. 
---
My stuff is totally decorated too. I think I had 14 gun racks and 5 display cases in my old camp even. 
---
I'm totally on PS4. HRockit is my PSN. I should be on a bunch tomorrow if you want to come take a look. Honestly, my new camp may only be half done but it just isnt as impressive. The domes take up more budget than I like. May just go back to my original design.
---
Legendary plasma rifles did not start dropping until after they discontinued explosive energy weapon drops. You haven’t seen any because they never dropped
---
I think Bethesda deserve a fair bit of criticism, mainly for not communicating more with the players when they specifically said they would be more open and honest with us. 
---
That said I do agree with the argument in this post. A lot of people have always been against this game and now seem so heavily invested in any bad story that comes out for it. Certain YouTubers have their whole livelihoods driven around negative press and I don't expect that to change anytime soon. 
---
I don't think it's "whataboutism" to talk about how the focus seems to be solely on Bethesda and Fallout 76. The studio, again, absolutely deserves some of the criticism but not at the expense of letting other studios with far, FAR, more aggregious decisions get away with it.
---
I don't attack no one under lvl 50! If ur over lvl 50 ur fucked!
---
How do these values stack with each and with the legendary effect?  Is it like armor piercing which is subject to diminishing returns, or is theoretically possible to get zero cost VATS?
---
Yes, the berries are not on those trees though, they are inside the location, usually buried in the middle.
---
My main is a sneak rifleman unyielding bloody lever action. It's great for farming and leveling I haven't made ammo for months. I can one shot lvl 68 super mutants, sheepsquatch and scorchbeast are 5 to 10 shots. I switch in commando and run bloody FFR handmade for ISS and the queen though.
---
My AAE Lever Action is amazing at sneak damage, while my AAE Auto Handmade is great for the greater health and armor enemies such as Scorchbeasts, SBQ and the Sheepsquatch.
---
It's all on the wiki 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Atomic_Shop
---
Interesting, I'm sure way back I scrapped a bunch of those.
---
Don’t have prime
---
While I think that wastelanders will be what finally decides if they game will continue to exist or die, we can't really say anything about the overall quality or size of the additions until it's released.
---
But it's clear that wastelanders will **NOT** be a "tiny add-on".
---
Is this going to be a weekly thing now?
---
They do not seem to be particularly useful, even the vanilla combat rifle (not Fixer) deals more ballistic damage with the same ammo, and the small amount of radiation is usually only enough to fill some of the part of the health bar already cleared by the ballistic damage. It could be useful on enemies with a very large amount of health (as radiation is essentially a % damage), but damage sponge monsters tend to also have high resistance to radiation. And to deal high rads, the gamma gun looks like a better choice.
---
I was hesitant at first, with the flux required. But going prime, especially on the lmg, is so much easier on the lead and steel.
---
You expect an event? Don't get your hopes up... BGS will only disappoint... IF we get one, it'll be the same broken mess as the halloween event. No doubt.
---
Aren’t they always hostile to you even after doing the event? They have been for my anyway to my knowledge
---
Go walk through white springs and take everything out. Wait 1 hour. Drop nuke. Everything should spawn. Only way I’ve consistently gotten everything to spawn solo.
---
Yep. Glowing meat drops from most glowing creatures. Mole Miners drop it as well and they're affected by "Cannibal" instead of "Butcher's Bounty".
---
I stated in another comment that I don't really mind because it gives me a reason to still get excited about finding adhesive and screws. Unfortunately my two outstanding mods are the powerful auto receiver and preforating mag which I'd totally use if I had them. 
---
I know people that can mod these for me but I'm determined to eventually learn them...
---
Isn’t he that guy who lives in his moms basement? You know the guy, has no life!
---
Do you have your build on Nuke Dragons? Also what weapon are you using?
---
The launch day of FO76 was the best day I have ever had on the game. Everybody running around Flatwood’s with shotguns not knowing what to do. I met a group of friends on the first day and we took all sorts of pictures together. Sadly my antivirus shredded every picture I took before I knew what was going on. Only thing left is some fond, fond memories...
---
I think that's the basic gist of why it isn't there now.  Consider, for a moment, the weapon displays in CAMPs.  How many weapons actually "fit" on that display?  Most of the larger ones clip halfway through the wall.  Some base models don't, but then you apply a mod and it looks weird.
---
Look at backpacks.  Aside from what would happen to them in a system like this, backpacks already clip weirdly through armor.
---
Last, having a visible weapon on your back means something else that has to be loaded into memory and rendered on your character.  There's a non-trivial cost associated with that, and a lot of permutations.
---
There was a post about this sometime ago. Someone actually did the work. I dont remember it but that user also said the same thing. Even stash contributes. For me, it may be coincidence or not, I have no nocturnal anything and I rarely get nocturnal drops. It may be true it might not be. Either way I'll try to find that post for you and your friend lll.
---
I see your back trying for YouTube fame again. Also posting another glitch. Don't forget to like and subscribe.
---
Unfortunately I doubt that person wanted a competitive pvp match. Usually they just want to be an asshole troll and destroy your base. Just ran into someone like that yesterday.
---
Are you sure Bethesda is shipping them out? Usually its the company that makes them.
---

Be sure to block them, so they can't follow and harass you.
---
Double xp weekend? When does it start?! I need to get to 100 asap.
---
This is the correct answer.
---
Beth is gonna ban us irl now...
---
Maybe, just maybe, because it is.
---
We judge Bethesda for what they actually do...exploiting and screwing their fans over. 
---
Other companies that decide to follow the same route will be equally judged for their actions.
---
I don’t have the plan
---
It was cut like a month and a half ago.
---
🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
---
Like many "old gamers" I skipped the challenges. But then they added them to the map. Now it is an indicator that needs to be cleared.
---
So I started doing them. Guess what, as I super hero through such easy challenges, I'm having fun in parts I've ignored for a hundred levels. And meeting new people again.
---
Find one, thank me later.
---
Agreed. The lack of iconic American guns of that cultural era is a shame, especially given the over abundant presence of otherwise relatively scarce MG42s and (modified) volkssturmgewhers.
---
I think you have to divide the criticism into two camps.  The people who played the game, left or quit, and continue to voice their grievances speak from a position of knowledge, higher than those who have badmouthed the game from the outset, but never played it and therefore receive all  their opinions second-hand.
---
The airport is probably a bad spawn point. Most matches I'm in have multiple teams spawn there. 
---
There's a safe outside of Mama Dolce's. It's in the warehouse that has all the traps in it in Adventure mode.
---
Wait, are you telling me they placed the VTU Cap back into the loot list after removing it? Looool well folks are gonna be farming the fuck out of that now seeing as most believed it to be a legacy after it was removed about a month or so ago.
---
I haven't crashed in this game since the Halloween Event. Not sure why your crashing but maybe I'm just lucky :S
---
Whoops! All Memberberries!
---
People have suggested this in the past.  I thought it was a cool idea that would get around some of the budget issues we currently have, although it would probably be annoying for visitors to load into... and half the fun of CAMPs is leveraging the scenery around you.
---
And on top of that what weapons in your bag would be on your back just the equipped one because that requires more coding it would be a nightmare to have to do that
---
Computer programmer here.  "Little" bugs are not always little - they are often symptoms of a much larger problem. The ones that stick around often do so because the cure is worse than the disease.
---
I agree and that is your choice! Just saying that company will try to get money and it is up to us the buyers whether we support them and hope they start getting in gear, or abandon them and let them fail and close down.
---
I was really happy to see this post today. Last night I was on Public servers with my brother in law. He is level 27 and just learning the game. He took a workshop and I decided to use that time to teach him how to get resource extractors etc. Through this process we were attacked and killed by invisible explosive bloodied assault rifle PVP'ers on more than 5 or 6 different occasions.  The irony is that he is level 27, meanwhile my workshop I took earlier in the day  was completely unmolested (Maybe because I'm 155+?). So not only are they a-holes in my opinion, but they will pick on the lowest level players to get their grief rocks off on.
---
They don't care about the workshop at all and are only using it to grief other players. This was difficult to explain properly to him since he doesn't play a lot of games. Each one of the 3 different players who performed these actions also had incredibly low gamerscores (one was 800?). Which tells me they are making smurf accounts using the Xbox home console sharing to insulate themselves from the blow-back of being a-holes.
---
The entire setup for workshop contention no longer fits in with adventure mode. If you are building up a workshop you aren't going to have PVP gear or perks equipped. What he learned from the experience was that players are toxic and only want to punish others by abusing game mechanics to force PvP on you. At the end of the night he has asked me to jump into private servers in the future just to avoid such encounters.
---
A few hours later someone initiated the Scorched Queen fight, one of those very griefers (Level 300+)was there to partake only to get frustrated from dying and left our server 🤣 . Meanwhile my level 27 brother-in-law survived further illustrating the disparity between a PvP and PvE loadouts.
---
I find it comical that eventually it'll be a-hole griefers alone with players who don't want or cannot afford Fallout 1st on Public servers.
---
you become a detritivore
---
lucky for you, i have some fertilizer to sell you...
---
I'd like to see the back packs be customizable and a holster slot where I could display a weapon rather then it holster 
---
since I'd love to customize my character with extra magazines or grenades or shovels and stuff so people could tell what I was meant to be from a distance. That said I'd prefer it to be cosmetic rather then a real weapon cause I don't want to see people with a flamer duct taped to their back.
---
No clue if they removed it at some point but I got it.  I was aware it was pretty rare after a friend tried to farm for it earlier this Summer.  I was shocked when I got it.  I kind of made for a perfect anniversary day!
---
Most of the little bugs are tied to the netcode and bethesda austin has never made an online game before.
---
They also got this game dumped on then at the 11th hour to hobble something together so they never got the opportunity to make it work.
---
so a mmo

Whoa, really?  THE jonaaBOT 2000 is here on Reddit?  Oh my God!  
---
Self, don't fangirl out.  Don't you do it!
---
I may just take you up on that. My username on Xbox is same as on here.
---
Suffer. Happens regularly for me.
---
Sorry for your lost
---
Only if it opens up to a small personal underground vault.
---
They removed survival mode in order to replace it with the Fallout 1ST subscription.
---
Those private servers had to come from somewhere.
---
I believe they are treated like atom shop items, which is to say no, I don't think you can.
---
Honestly, if the 10 mm became a default model in a default holster when on my characters hip, that would be fine with me.  Having a shotgun in an over the shoulder holster or a rifle on your back with some straps when holstered would be so great.
---
But alas...
---
I hope so, because this is just lazy.
---
How many people are on your friends list?
---
I just want the M1A/M14 seeing as it was shown in Fallout 4 but never actually in the game.
---
Can confirm, just got the Vault 96 jumpsuit off the Queen. Can't seem to find where to craft it, though.
---
This is part of it. The other part of it it is prioritization. Some bugs may be easy to fix but only effect a few players or are considered unimportant. Exploits like the ones patched this week effect everyone and damage the server stability and in game economy. If a bug that takes a lot of work to fix is prioritized then smaller bugs get pushed aside indefinitely.
---
You have to swizzle the nizzle on the bizzle, fo'shizzle...
---
Dizzler isn't a disease in FO76, to my knowledge.
---
They removed survival for nw because no one played survival.
---
You cannot. Like someone else said, they are considered atom shop items, and any item painted with a NW reward skin cannot be dropped, traded, or sold.
---
Apart from classic instigating explosive or bloodied, check out how well Medics can work: https://youtu.be/AZEoffL4wDw that’s one of my latest builds.
---
As well if you are on PC i have one 2 star medic crit damaged combat shotgun for sale 😅
---
What’s your build? Bloodied/high health?
---
Any of the tree-shaped fast travel points in the bog have cranberries
---
I've been waiting for a hardmode for this game, but it's never come. :P 
---
As others have mentioned you're thinking of survival mode, and it went buh-bye, likely to never return again.
---
Best bet is that we'll eventually get an option to turn off pacifism in private servers and turn those into hosted PVP realms.
---
I have a 2 shot pump action. Thats best I've found so far.
---
Exactly that too long friend list is the main cause of micro freezes.
---
Yeah I played for about 2 hours after work last night and it happened twice, on Xbox One
---
No such thing man.
---
It’s clear to everyone that OP is basically saying “we don’t deserve hate because everyone else is doing it”. 
---
But it’s also clear that people in this sub are BETHESDA fans, not EA fans, not Sony fans....
---
And it’s clear as fans we’ve been repeatedly let down by a company that took our money, and continues instead of trying to fix things, to try get more money from us. 
---
Stop trying to deflect the fact that you’re a bad company, by pointing out how bad everyone else is. 
---
Either be better and get no hate, or join the toxic industry and get slaughtered like all the others?
---
Like others I follow it because I hope *someday* they remove the greed and get back to being the bethesda we all grew up with, or at least start communicating more. The Silence is probably the most infuriating thing, but I can see why u/valseek and u/ladydevann want to keep some distance (thank you for what you both do btw). 
---
Haven't played in months - since the dev room was discovered. 
---
A lot of what was going on was understandable (to me at least) as this is a huge jump for a company / IP that was still *very* new to this sort of thing. 
---
Stability was a problem, but up until fallout 1st I didn't have a real dislike for it, I just ran out of interesting things to do. I play NIS games for the grind because they figured out how to keep it fun, beth still has some things to learn there so it gets kinda boring. 
---
I don't think there is any malice from the devs - just some higher ups (probably at zenimax) that want to be the next EA and don't understand how anything works.
---
Lack of people working on testing (testing is expensive af) or a very bad organization from the team developing the game. But I think it's because there's no investment in testing.
---
lol, will this ever stop?
---
At least they're both white.
---
1) Start using the market
---
2) Find a commodity to farm then sell. 
---
3) Profit
---
Acid generally sells at 3-5 depending on the buyer and is fairly easy to farm in large quantities. 
---
Fluxes are usually 100-200 depending on the buyer but it's harder to farm large quantities. 
---
Lead and ammo also sell well. Lead is 2-3 apiece and ammo is dependent on type, but 5.56 consistently sells at 1:1.
---
The original was the not-canvas-it’s-nylon-bag. 
---
I doubt it. We never signed up for replacement because they fuked up and people’s addresses were shown
---
Cap limit? What the hell? Whats the point of that???
---
So, you are saying you duped your bag?
---
That's not how this works, if they wanted to monetise they would have called it dlc and said so. They said all story contentvwould be free and they didnt monetise Nuclear winter either, so why would they with this.
---
Might be a localization thing. Perhaps the whoospies is called that in OP's locale.
---
They dont need to justify if it isnt making money they can just shut down. Nobody knows the real player numbers so noone could say they were lying. They wouldnt put a year into wastelanders if they were just trying to shut it down anyway
---
Scorchbeasts are animals, that is why Hunter legendary prefix works on them.
---
In my country Is called "vertigini"
---
Maybe a different wording would be better:
---
"When the community is full of loud, hateful people who hate literally everything Bethesda does, and when your track record as a company is bungling new features for a game that a large number of people actively hate, why bother doing anything?"
---
Every time they do anything, there's 100 Reddit posts and 100 YouTube jackasses who slam Bethesda at every turn. Even when they do something that is a positive for their bottom line that **people actually seem to like in the real world**, they get nothing but hate and grief from people online. All the press regarding anything they do is negative. So, I ask again, why bother to do anything?
---
If all you do is fuck up, why try anything new? Especially for a non-event like this.
---
Make a makeshift shooting range with the targets at the end being cut out vault people so that we can see the damage output. Give away a low level gun or two. People generally make their own ammo so sell lead, steel and gun powder.
---
Yup, that is him!
---
Do a run of WestTek and Whitesprings. Pick up all the weapons, chems and glowing meat you find. You should get a decent haul of assault and laser rifles plus a bucket load of XP. Cook the glowing meat to get glowing meat steaks - remember super duper.
---
Sell the lot to the vendors. You'll get around 11 caps per steak and potentially upwards of 100 for rifles depending on the spec/level. You'll get 10 caps per stimpak too.
---
I usually find that one trip around there will give me enough stuff to sell to the vendors and clear out their 1400 daily limit.
---
Sorry for your luck man. It is a harsh lesson many of us had to learn the hard way. The cap used to be 25k.
---
I just assumed it's the whoopsies since it's the most sought after disease. I'll be coming up on 2000 hours soon and still haven't contracted that disease.
---
Except for the fact that you're forgetting that's not how programming works at all. Like a previous commenter already stated, the guns in fallout work on a modular mesh system. There's a model for each component, and a parent skeleton that those models go on. From a game coding perspective, every single one of those models is the same object, just with modified child objects. The best way to describe it is a "vehicle" where no matter where the vehicle goes, the pieces attached to it go as well. So you only really need to include position data for where the model would be on someone's back for various weapon types (pistol, rifle, shotgun, sword, etc), and the pieces will place themselves in the proper configuration. That's how you would see weapons fall on the ground in FO4.  Same system implemented here. And textures are entirely model based as well, it would be even easier to display skins since it's just a swap of a texture file. This is all such an easy system, it's literally one of the first things they teach you while designing games in college level programs.
---
Suffer. Won't get fixed ever.
---
Only gullible area is north east on bolton greens or north of the pumpkin shack which both have a series of military vehicles on the road.
---
Unless the scrip machine is bugged now, it should not let you do that.
---
Say that b/c the times I've been in that situation, I got a dialog telling me max script reached when I press X - and it will not  continue.   The weapon or armor stays in my inventory.
---
It's their job to entertain you on their birthday... ok. 
---
I agree that they need to get people to love the game, but you are delusional as hell if you think that a birthday event was going to change that. With their track record lately, they had a high probability of fucking whatever they planned up. So, I ask again, why bother to do anything?
---
How did you make the firing range?
---
Short answer: Probably no.
---
You have a couple things working against you.
---
1. Bethesda ended their replacement offer on May 3, 2019 (according to Bethesda support when I was fighting for my replacement)
---
2. The replacement required an original proof of purchase.  You said "got your hands on", that implies to me that you are not the original purchaser?
---
IF you are the original purchaser and simply missed the ship on the replacement... you can \*try\* to contact Bethesda support about it and try to be politely convincing... But to be honest I wouldn't hold me breath on it.
---
I actually reduced my friends list months ago when i heard it could help stability in game, how many do we have to get it down to? im down to only 30 friends!
---
Sell ammo 45s 308s and 556. 50 rounds and 5mm will go to. I make atleast 40k a day this way. Just keep reinvesting in ammo find an ammo dealer they always do a good cut if you return. I farm legendaries and sell them 250c per star for scrip purposes. Cheap as chips, I keep the good stuff seperate and price as appropriate.
---
Wow it's almost like we expect a standard of quality on the products we spend our hard earned money on.
---
It is happening on PC as well.
---
At your level, at your location, I'd go for low level legendaries. Priced low, they move fast, as long as you dont sell junk. People hate junk. Dont offer it.  Ammo is also a good seller for your location. Do you lucky hole?
---
I’m a fan and like the game, but I hate Bethesda and how they choose to monetize this game. I felt comfortable pre-ordering this game because the monetization of the game didn’t seem nefarious, now it is.
---
Not currently. Should I list scrip legends also? How much for?
---
What are you doing here ferg, get the fuck outta here
---
Othais and Mae are great!
---
Wasnt it creditcards and everything aswell? 😂
---
This is nitpicking to the point of lunacy.
---
Well, they are up until WAR WERE DECLARED.
---
Another thing to remember, Bethesda is a company that has developers who have bosses and a business office. Taking time to fix things requires time and effort that the business office might not grant. Plus bugs don't cost Bethesda anything to leave in except good will of the players. They have addressed some things, but the rest is clearly not a priority.
---
It really is pathetic, if you even mention 1 thing about pvp, or try to reason with people, you end up at -5 upvotes
---
No scrip legendaries. I've tried, but not worth the space in the vendor. Others do that better. Curate your sales. Only list stuff you would buy.
---
Get the excavator armor and do lucky hole runs to sell 5.56. I commonly by 5000-6000 rounds anytime they are available. 
---
At a bit higher level, sell stable flux 250 each. You wont be able to keep it in stock.
---
Yeah, so now you just need the simple way of having 5 characters at max caps and some super crazy trading scheme where you have to trade with each other mules for caps and hopefully eventually get the item you wanted, ahhh, the cap limit works like a charm
---
Thanks! How will I get the other items for 5.56?
---
One question: are you currently or have you ever been the drummer for Spinal Tap?
---
lol took me 2 seconds to search your GT on this sub and this is the only post so probably not
---
I remember that from the live action trailer!
---
Ya the latter. I like the game but haven't played in awhile. I stay for updates.
---
Agree but valuation of stuff in this game is wierd.
---
I get ppl who will scoff at my near god rolls bc of price. Bffrrw fixer, be railway, ve 50, etc. 
---
 Have gotten messages for me to lower price. Before i agree i alway go check their vending. Almost always 1star scrip items for 1-3k lol. Obv no trade, they gauge harder than me.
---
Könnte man meinen. Jedoch bin ich schon länger Krank geschrieben. Und die Zeit mit diesem Spiel zu vertreiben ist willkommene Beschäftigung.
---
Did you post your intentions? He may of just thought you were clearing inventory for who ever wanted them rather then destroying the items
---
Hate to break the bad news, but if you had 18K caps, you've lost out on 38k, not 32k
---
Farm Super Mutants also they always have Caps 90% of the time.
---
You can't mark anything free ever. Someone will always do this. Even just a 25 cap pricetag is usually enough to keep a vulture away and still allow a low level to buy it if they want. If you are selling rarer ones like handmades or lever action even at higher prices people will probably buy and scrap just to learn mods.
---
Pretty much just a 1 wide by 5 or 6 long hallway with a bunch of stuff to shoot at down on one end. 
---
Also had a door to the side that went out to a platform where you could shoot outside at more various targets
---
It’s too early for all dis
---
Appreciate the explanation :)
---
thanks for that :)
---
I should read more lore, appreciated :)
---
I grind any super mutant or mole miner locations for guns, with scrapper equipped you get like 14 steel for assault rifles. 
---
Acid from the whitesprings laundry and cave crickets. Tangera town, and sometimes lucky hole even spawn them. The raid also spawns them but might be a bit hard still.
---
Cloth is easy. 100 for the airport responder mission.
---
I gave up on workshops for resources, one kill gives more scrap than an hour in an extractor.
---
Here he comes. https://imgur.com/gallery/Cws4Sd4
---
I thought they were glorified slugs. :D I had no idea. Thx heaps :)
---
40k a day..? Did you mean perhaps 4k?
---
It's been almost a year now and I still haven't received my actual canvas bag from them. I gave up hope for it long ago.
---
I finally got it (1000+ hours in) last week after letting a diseased mirelurk spawn bite at my ankles for 10mins
---
So much for a canvas shortage, lol.
---
No problem :)
---
Fastest way that I’ve found:
---
Look up where you can get the plan for making the marine tactical helmet. Server hop the location till you get it the plan. Get the super duper perk card at lvl 3. Make a bunch of them every day (only requires rubber, plastic, and glass) with hard bargain etc.  I get 31 caps for each helmet from a vendor. Literally takes me 5 mins to get my 1,400 caps per day using this method.
---
They are different. Neither is better than the other. It is up to you to determine the build you will have more fun with. Non automatic does more damage per bullet, but automatic fires more bullets, so saying either is more powerful depends on your own opinion on power.
---
Copy and paste, they dont even type anything in anymore 🤣👌
---
They can be powerful, my best one was Bloodied and did 1300, and the two shot did 1200. I didn't have more than Demo 1.
---
I thought it was pretty underpowered too, in its defense tho I was trying to use it on enemies a good 30 levels higher than me, but it def did about as much damage as my rifle to them
---
It’s the water chip all over again
---
The Corvega generator's shop description said it was cleaner/quieter or something along those lines but it was just as loud and smokey as a vanilla one. I think anything like that is supposed to be just flavour text.
---
Time will tell, though we can sip cocktails, eat popcorn, and watch the world burn while we wait!
---
I just think reaching a year we would see less of these “diseases”
---
Have a sample weapon in stock and have a sign saying for low levels to ask and they shall receive, that way you personally can decide if they are low enough level
---
Hell, Skyrim had it in the code but it was just disabled. It was a buggymess, but the point is it was there.
---
Danke.
---
It only really happens on the “quick weapon switch” and the mole rats popping up sometimes, but that was like that before the patch
---
Duper!11
---
I'll take it off your hands
---
Because weapons now have modifications, it's hard to implement with the engine. What the engine did in fallout 3 (and what some mods do in fallout 4) is this: Everytime you holster a weapon, it unequips it from your hand and equips you with a piece of armor that is the weapon holstered. So if they want to implement it, they would need to create a new holster method different from the other games, or create a piece of "armor " of every combination of weapon and its mods.
---
Someone will always take it. It's just the way of things, same goes for setting stuff really cheap.
---
I wish they would come up with a way for more.people.per server, not less.
---
I was talking to one of the mods and she says there was alot of mentions of my name she had to take down
---
Shotguns haven’t been very good since the nerf but they can still be a lot of fun to use. I have an end game lvl 160 shotgun character and switch back and forth between an AAE pump and a IE pump. The good news is that it’s easier to find and acquire good legendary shotguns through trading because they are not very popular right now. Hopefully shotguns will get a buff in the future.
---
Constantly; sometimes it be just for 5 seconds, sometimes I just had to restart the game all together. Not too sure what is going on but no bueno
---
Hide the scrip box at your camp, don't use FO1 icons and don't wear the ranger outfit.
---
About 2,150 though I quit a month ago. Prob 1,800 or so past the sweet spot I guess but that old \*sunk cost\* fallacy...
---
🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑
---
Super Mutants sure. But Snallygasters and the Grafton Monster?
---
The Snallygaster, according to the wiki, is a product of many different species and FEV but I couldn't find a line that stated humans are part of the mix. Can you provide a source for that claim?
---
The Grafton monster is also an result of West Tek's experiments and based of the Snallygasters strain. So if the Snallygaster proofs to be at least partly human before, the Grafton Monster is too.
---
They aren't going to need bloodied since it is already balanced between damage output and low health.
---
Please no, no disappointments:( have you bought FF? If not please do
---
Having worked in the industry my suspicion and hope is that a lot of these things will be cleaned up with the release of wastelanders. Some of them (the ones that carried over from fallout 4 especially) are so tied into the core of the game that they are not worth trying to fix unless you are already planning on making major alterations to the game.
---
Could it be a lot less than 95% even though it displays 95%? Also I wonder what do kind of RNG are they using for hits/misses. There has to be a bug in here somewhere lol.
---
I really don't think this works. I've tried it for Nuclear Winter, cutting my list down to ~40 from &gt;200, and it made no difference.
---
You really can't put out free stuff, and then say, but only the right person can take them. Well you can. And then you can come and complain. I mean, what did you expect to happen? To them, it was probably free resources. Also, maybe they took it for an alt to use. If they had switched to the alt and took it, would you have been upset? Would you have noticed?
---
Well... They work as good area damage weapons, same as grenades. My explosives character is fun during events, doing mob control. Line in the sand, tea time, collision course, violent night, campfire tales, scorched Earth... I get to kill most and tag the rest. 
---
Don't expect them to work for real. Plus, yao guai have some hard skin.
---
You can add me, ymb_loki509. 
---
I can give you some low lvl stuff to start.
---
Bonjour!

Je m'appelle DivineAlmond! Sarkozy, Macron, Paris Saint Germain, Zinedine Zidane.
---
Vampire's to stay healthy and Bloodied/Junkies for slaughtering. For secondary effects I'd look for faster fire, damage while aiming, or damage resistance while aiming.
---
I followed Cubeworld for 6yrs, I think I can manage a sliver of hope that Bethesda will pull their head out of their sphincter sounding chamber.
---
And no bethesda we said we want new guns. Not a fucking skin.
---
Hi,   
---
 The same people did so much to sign that the banks shirked the others, from 24h to 1 week .... What are Bethesda and Microsoft doing to fight against abusive reporting?  Strictly nothing ...   
---
Bonjour,   
---
Les mêmes personnes ont tellement fait de signer que les banques se sont dérobées les autres, passant de 24h à 1 semaine ....Que font Bethesda et Microsoft pour lutter contre les signalement abusif ? 
---
Strictement rien...
---
depends on what your build is mostly for the primary effect. i personally run junkie since im a junkie build. Medics vampire can be used effectively for heals.  bloodied/junkie for damage boosts. Quad on a double barrel is pretty nasty.
---
 as far as secondary goes explosive still reigns supreme, because of AoE cripples.
---
all this said, there is a special spot in my heart for a QE auto combat for raids.  the CC pf it is unmatched imo
---
Its not you, its the stupid system that allows accidentally passing of limit. If I'm at cap or near cap and the thing the person has surpasses what I can hold it should dam well not make the caps disappear.
---
Unfortunately I didn't go to any game design class so I was just going off my basic coding knowledge so this comment is actually helpful for me at least I learned the very basics of multiple languages in a high school class I took and made very basic 2d games
---
Bounce splash damage, don’t hit them directly, also make sure you have grenadier on
---
Bethesda be banning the merchandise team for duping irl
---
There's a group of tanks and jeeps just north of the pumpkin house
---
Complaints that the company is greedy, then they give a customer an extra bag, then complaining about that.  Amazing.
---
Super Duper man. Extra without any additional materials.
---
Double atoms, but also double requirements.

"Take a picture of a wendigo in a rad storm while fighting a Super Mutant Behemoth while naked and drunk."

Heard similar requests before, it’s a great idea!
---
Boredom, malice, and/or a desire to distract from personal problems.
---
Or figuring out ways to turn glitches and issues players have into monetization methods that have much simpler implementations. **cough** junk stash **cough**
---
I miss when feed the people actually fed all the people
---
I bet they regret making people available to earn atoms in game 😄
---
For me it’s any time I do anything Xbox related. Send a message, read a message, check lfg for sales. Get a 3-5 second screen freeze EVERY. Single. Time.
---
Yeah, it's actually something that I learned when I first started coding with an intro java software called Alice. It's was really helpful and honestly if I hadn't had that experience first I probably wouldn't have been as well off in game design then I am. But honestly the best part of it all is the efficiency that arises out of it, finding little short cuts here and there to make things run easier and more smoothly. You learn a lot of memory saving tricks that you just don't generally think about when you're not dealing with gigs worth of models textures and other files all at once!
---
Just to be clear, I don’t expect you to believe me, however I managed to get a tour of gearbox because my dad had cancer and we went to go see the voice actor for claptrap only to find that he hadn’t come into work that day. Or really according to not only Randy Pitchford, but the guy who toured us and the people in the offices around his. I’ve already had this discussion with a few people, but I’m not saying Randy is in the good, just that I’m trying to give a different perspective on the issue. Again, if you don’t believe me I don’t care, however it’s what happened. Sorry if this is off-topic to what you’re pointing out, I just hate to see him go under the radar as if he did nothing wrong.
---
Lag is very common on everything in this game, have you tried searching a container with a perk? It literally freezes for a few seconds after it activates.
---
I can just imagine seeing all the people with a Gatling Plasma or Naval Cannon strapped to their backs.
---
Items are unobtainable for most players anyways because are trade only, im sitting with 100k+ caps and shit legendaries. If there was a higher cap then I'd might actually find a decent legendary for caps.
---
depending on what missions you have accomplished:  IMHO, bunker buster is better than a standard missile launcher.
---
With no related perks, etc, it does about 350 per shot.  
---
That it has a targeting computer make a nice upgrade.  I've toyed with it against  yogis, mireluck queens, and just for fun, a deathclaw.  SBs and strategic cargobots bounce around too much to consistently hit.
---
The downside is I only got about 10 shots out of it before it broke.
---
Yeah I remember we thought that was the whole point the first few times we did it.  Seems like it also used to spawn a lot more enemies.
---
The first time we did it on launch day it felt like we were up against some massive army of ghouls.  Of course that could of been because we were like Level 5...
---
If you're giving stuff away with that method, set it free. Don't worry about who takes it or why.
---
If you want to give to specific types you'll probably be happier if you talk to them or otherwise see them face-to-face.
---
Give me an example of your game session?
---
You should read up on psychological analysis of groups with their religion or cult being challenged.
---
Funny how similar it is to the playerbase's response in their behavior in terms to those defending Bethesda. 
---
Specifically when shown literal proof, they continually avoid the potential cognitive dissonance by doubling down.
---
You on ps4? Next time someone try's to take your workshop let me know.

I stay and continue to play Fallout 76 because I love the series plus can't return the Tricentennial edition I bought. Originally a massive fanboy but with so many problems in this game from losing a bunch of my TSE Weapons from a crash to constant new bugs leaves nothing but bad things to say about this game. I still play and heck I got 11,000 atoms I've gained since playing since day 1 and haven't bought any extra shows how much I play this game but in the end of the day this game is demoralizing see always more and more problems being added.
---
TLDR I love the series but seeing Bethesda
---
its possible it was changed in one of the last patches.  (I have not hit daily scrip limit since the week before mischief night.)  PS4, BTW
---
Oh no I agree, politics is another huge one as well
---
The real problem is that people seem to be seriously lapping up Fo1st, and thus continue to fuel the massive forest fire.
---
Somebody mentioned lower limbs... i am there!
---
I could see them adding it but so many people would SCREAM P2W because of the extra cap limit. Especially if they there wasn't a cap on the extra slots. I have no doubt they'll eventually add it but there will be people who twist it into "this is p2w bullshit"
---
I can see that for newer players or players who have a hard time looting stuff fast. I've been the most successful spawning there though, even with multiple rivals spawning nearby, since I'm very familiar with that place.
---
I see Morgantown airport as the equivalent of the Vault-Tech Agricultural Research Center from the other NW map and the city as a much larger version of Flatwoods. The similarities made my transition from the older map to the new one much easier when I started to notice them.
---
I mostly main as a rifleman (semi-auto rifles with the crossbow and scoped combat rifle being my preferred weapons for this mode).
---
I don't care if a CEO of a game company strangles hookers. If the game is good, it's good.
---
Go to the market sub, you can get one cheap
---
There are still several cheats that are not detected. Cheats that have been since launch, I laugh everytime I see them.
---
Be careful, knowing Bethesda they’ll blame you, give you a life time ban and never reply to your emails

I'd be fine if there was a caps based method to respec your character in-game, and with a daily limit. Say 5000 caps and you get to choose everything over again. Not too expensive but more than enough so people wouldn't abuse it somehow.
---
I love how I've been saying all of this, nicely or rudely for a while now, but almost all I've gotten is spite in return.
---
It's a Legendary. Very few Legendary items in this game have a specific place to earn them, and the one you are looking for is completely random from the Purveyor or Legendary enemies. If you want one, you are best off buying one from someone.
---
I’ve noticed that the ones who complain about the complainers are ones whose parents are buying them games.
---
That's pretty annoying, and I fully agree that it's common decency to leave freebies for others that need them.  
---
As others have said: it's worth putting a token price tag on items, to minimize such abuse.  If a low level player can manage the fast-travel fees to get to your camp, they can handle spending a similar amount on one or two useful short-term disposable weapons.  
---
The only other explanation I can see is that he went to your vendor to investigate the large weapons count, only to find it stocked with junk (to him). That doesn't make it okay to grief the camp owner by taking it all, but you can see where the annoyance might come from.  
---
That is the problem with low-level and charity vendors: there's no way to tell them from a vendor stocked with higher-level items.  And it is frustrating to see a camp with 25 weapons listed, only to burn the time and fast-travel caps to find out that 23 of them are zero-star level-10 pump shotguns.  Charity looks more-or-less like padding your vendor stock, unless you're willing to spend 30% of your camp budget on lettering explaining the intent.  And of course those signs don't show up on the map!
---
It's never occurred to me to check until now, but I wonder if an unconnected vendor will remove its content from the map-advertised equipment count? I know unpowering ALL of the vendors will remove your camp from the map, while still allowing the vendor to operate as normal once accessed locally.  But I don't know if the equipment lists are drawn from just the powered vendors or from all vendors in the camp.  If it's the former, that seems like the best option: place the freebies in an unadvertised vendor.  Would be nice if that works.  Going to have to check that out tonight.
---
Indeed, turns out people really really don't like being wrong in front of a bunch of people. Even if everyone else is wrong at the same time.
---
They should be more powerful, totally agree
---
Events don't give you specific legendaries, most events don't give any at all. Hunt down legendary enemies those have a chance of dropping one. Take the bad rolls you find and put them in the scrip machines and buy legendaries from Mole Mama, she can give bless you with one. There's also a chance of finding one at player vendors
---
Got 2nd place with no weapon, just sit in a bush and stay in the circle.
---
Damn stole my legs
---
That’s probably going to happen no matter what they do. The reality is that they are going to have to implement the same types of things other online games do in order to be financially successful with this title. Personally as long as they don’t start selling legendary traits for weapons and armor in the atomic shop I don’t care. The vocal minority attacking the game on here usually don’t even play the game and have no effect on their sales or the success of the game.
---
Dey tuk maaaaaaa leyagggsssss!
---
I usually drop at the power plant or jail. If we drop at the lattter, we'll sweep through the airport.  I've had better luck at the jail when it's crowded.  If you get a few teams there, it's like a cage match with guns, lol. 
---
And agreed that the crossbow is awesome. I run a handmade, the crossbow, and a scoped lever if I can find it. I'll pick people off at range when the opportunity arises, but prefer the mid range fight.
---
He took my legs and ran, i woulda chased him but on account as he got my legs i could not
---
put on your excavator and do the WS cottage circle.  take all loot from the critters you kill.  Take everything that isn't nailed down.  (You should be able to carry up to 1720# and still move without crawling)  dont forget to check the medicine cabinets.
---
At the end of the run, go over to blackwater and repeat in the outside buildings.
---
go the WS station, scrap what you might need.
---
Equip hard bargain 3 and pop a grape mentats.
---
Sell rest to the bot vendor, scrip any legendary you dont want.
---
By this time, most of the critters should have respawned.
---
Do the same run a second time.  That should put you very  near daily cap limit.
---
You can also go inside WS resort, take all the phones, vases, clipboards, phones, and whatever is in the trash cans.  Scrap/sell as needed.
---
Or they got them for free just grabbing the ones who used .exe instead of launcher.
---
Yeah it was great, one of my favorites MMO landscapes ever, but it could have been better. Its an amazing IP in the hands of a company that's now focusing on Conan Exiles and other yuck IPs. Its a shadow of what it could have been. SWL was a horrible cash grab with very obvious pay to win loot box mechanics. Updates were very few and very far between, and the only updates it got early were the unfinished things that were meant to ship with the game in the first place. Very sad.
---
Hmmm sounds like a great time hahaha
---
You cant enter NW with mods. Cheats are not mods tho.
---
What system are you on?
---
Two bags. And yet a year later I still haven’t gotten my first one.
---
I actually one hundred percent agree with you, was mostly speaking about their possible hesitancy in adding it. Yeah the truth is character slots would bring them fat stacks of cash. Hardcore traders buy second accounts already, but even casual traders would buy extra character slots
---
Yeah, that's why I got rid of the legendary one I get for completing enclave questline. It was only good for very low level groups of mobs, like raids on my workshops. It wasn't worth the 30-40 pounds of storage space it took up either.
---
Step 1: buy X01 Calib legs
---
Step 2: put legs into your stash
---
Step 3: accuse the guy selling of stealing them back somehow ..
---
Step 4: profit??? Stonks???
---
Step 5: be made into a meme for the next 6months
---
You can have more than one?
---
I never got my first replacement lol.
---
I've had this problem consistently with a few events. Every time I travel to a horde event, never completed one. And most times I travel to leader of the pack. Those are the only two I usually have an issue with.
---
And for pvp grab as many workshops as possible, server hopp if nobody gets the bait.
---
For half a day or something. I just waited a month and had no issues, but a Nylon and a Canvas bag now.
---
There were lots of issues, no doubt, but not nearly as bad as this sub and certain youtubers try to make it.
---
Damn theif you are
---
I have to think the buyer was being silly as well. Offering 50 000 caps when you are not in a position to offload the caps they knew you would not be getting all of them. Unless the low level was yours and had no caps, and you also had zero caps. then there was no way possible you could have made this work. As you say they offered 50k caps, you had to be in communication with them so why did neither of you mention this. This is why i buy extra serum recipes, for a cap storage/trading currency.
---
Yeah, it's not pretty to watch, but neither are the cheaters on PC. It's a damn shame that the PC players can't enjoy NW without that fear.
---
You shouldn't expect giant corporations like Bethesda to be able to afford decent security.
---
Link to unofficial patch?
---
Yep, and I can't think of any excuse for that. PC cheats are not new, and Bethesda should have anticipated this and protected against it.
---
You can have up to five characters
---
Agreed 100% and honestly I don’t even mind that, people enjoy the game for different reasons. Your traders who do that enjoy the game for that reason and they provide a valuable service for the player base as a whole, without them the casual player would have almost zero chance of acquiring best in class/top tier items. I’m not a trader at all but I always see those players as working for me not against me. Because of them I have a chance to get items I wouldn’t have the time to chase after.
---
I agree with all of this
---
follow the power line S from Monongah.  
---
About 3 transmission towers down on the forest side, there's a bunch of targets already set up under the tower.  IIRC, some are the round archery style, others are silhouette.   You should be able to build your range around those.
---
Thing is the protection here is really bad. No problem to inject whatever you got since exe aint even hidden lol
---
The problem is that the more extreme the body shape, the more clothing breaks. Clothing is modeled on the base character and then stretched or shrunk to fit the expanded model. For example if you have a larger character, you get a lot more clipping and textures can look low res and distorted or you get clothes that don't look like they fit the character. To do it right, they would have to have multiple models of the character for the different body types, which they aren't going to do because it would mean every armor/clothing piece would need skinny, fat and regular models for both male and female body types.
---
I haven't played since Feb (unless you count logging in and playing one round of Nuclear Winter when it launched) and it is funny to see how things never change with this game. I mean I still see people cry out about game breaking glitches that have been in this game since launch. I've been a victim to numerous glitches that made me stop playing, and I'm sure you have been too.
---
I'm still subbed here because I guess I have a small shred of hope that this game will be saved. I don't want to see this game fail, however I'm also not sad to see it doing so poorly. I think Bethesda needs to learn something from this most recent mishap of "We don't have the DLC we promised you ready yet, we have been so busy drumming up all the feedback you have been giving us and selling back to you calling it fallout first."
---
I have to admit, my faith in Bethesda has been shook. I am on the fence about the next elder scrolls game after the blatant lies that Bethesda threw at us to "calm" the masses. IDK, I guess the question can now be flipped, why do you still play a game that has repeatedly broken promises to you the consumer, and then doesn't respond or make statements when caught in a lie?
---
I don’t care if my clothing is form fitting. I want to be busting out of it. Make me be naked if I am too fat. I don’t care.
---
Put things in your machine for free cause you want someone to take it. If you want someone specific to take it, give it straight to them. People don't know the rules of your vending machines.
---
Sorry to come into your post with a random ass question, but it's something I've been wondering for a while now and probably the only thing holding me back from creating a second character. Are the atom challenges character or account based? As in, if I create a new character can I do challenges again that I have already completed on my other character?
---
Source?
---
Pretty sure I still have one in my vending machines. I may have scrapped it because it wouldn’t sell though.
---
All legendaries are random (with the exception of a handleful of unique weapons ie “the all rise”)
---
Account based
---
Add me PSN: MadFlavo
---
Hard Bargain, Grape Mentats and sell serums and bulk random junk. Take care of this right when I login.
---
Granted. It's now in the Atomic Shop for 2200 atoms.
---
That's a very boring way to level up. People trying to grind the rewards simply by sitting in a bush tend to hate life. Earning the Halloween costume by camping would take about 12-40 hours, depending on how well you do it.
---
do you have healing factor mutation?
---
The trouble is affording the serum recipes
---
The Fixer? Really? What an addition lol. Some of those are just small questlines and I've seen modders do 10x that much with less resources and more bug support but thank you Bethesda for you half baked content. Project Paradise was ok....
---
Yeah, I'm not sure why the poster mentioned mods as a solution to cheating in NW.
---
Constantly. A lot of other similar bugs as well, like invisible enemies that shoot me before they actually load. The game is just objectively broken.
---
Mainly to see if they did anything worthwhile because it can be a fun game at times.
---
Well I learned something today. I didn't know about the caps limit. Thanks for sharing. At least, you can say you educated someone. Good luck.
---
Yea, it's like it's trying to disconnect me back can't quite do it. I've had an influx of infinite loading screens lately too.
---
Same, man. 
---
I even launched a nuke by myself to see if that did anything. There were... over a dozen Assaultrons in the nuke silo, so I thought it was supposed to be more of a challenge on that day or something. But no. Same nuke launch, same everything.
---
You’re saying they make it difficult-to-completely inaccessible for players to work around the cap limit, making it a limit to the number of caps you can trade with? Did you just sarcasm the correct answer?
---
Why not just create a second account and get 5 more character slots? I know people with 40-60 characters. It sounds awful to manage, but that's their thing, not mine.
---
IIRC, the Garand was in NV.
---
I think the carbine was in an earlier FO as well, but I could be wrong.  
---
oohh I've seen lots of Garands IRL....but never seen one with a reflex sight or compensator...might I ask where you found those?
---
They are account based right now, when the game released i remember some of the challenges popped for new characters I made but I’m 90% certain they are all account based now. All 5 of my character slots have been full for awhile now though. 
---
For me I just really enjoy the process of making new characters and trying different builds. I like have different builds for different weapons etc. sometimes I wanna play with shot guns, sometimes melee, sometimes a stealth sniper. I like the RP aspect of having a Raider character, a responder character, an enclave character, a BOS character etc. I like building and theming bases for them in different ways. I want to be able to play wastelanders different ways when it releases and factions are added in from different perspectives and actions. 
---
Some traders use multiple characters to be able to hold more overall caps and gear.
---
Drove me nuts it was never added
---
Your account name isn't tied to your in-game name and your in-game game can be changed every so often (90 days I think)
---
Regular cranberries can be found all over the cranberry bog in the pink forests and farms. You can make cranberry cobbler and disease cures with them.
---
If you want an XP boost, Tasty Squirrel Stew (I belive that's the name) is one of the best XP boosts I've seen.
---
Im saying that they actually made it harder, if people think somethings worth 100k caos then theyll either trade for it (which is harder than getting caps) or theyll sell it for that much regardless and now you need to make multiple characters with max caps instead of just getting that mnay caps on 1 character
---
I think maybe you might have read it wrong. I think what happened is that he had 18k to start, and got the 12k out of the first 25k. Then the other guy assumed that he traded it off to his other character, i have 2 and i know others do as well, and then traded the other 25k to him after he was already at 30k, giving him zero, but the other guy still lost it. I get that the other guy prolly should have asked if he was ready for the other half, but i understand why the other guy would just assume that the OP knew about the cap limit and wasn't going to waste their caps.
---
atta boy
---
You must be new here. The short answer is yes.
---
I have a Double Explosive laser lol. DOUBLE LEGACY!
---
Because then I wouldn’t have access to things I’ve already gotten through the atomic shop etc. I’m also on PS4 so then I’d have to pay for another PS4 plus to be able to play and buy the game again. I’d much rather pay a little bit for additional slot(s)
---
Why not create another account?
---
Unsure of your platform, but on PS4 I simply made a new PSN account and linked it to a new Bethesda account (email based) and now I have 5 more character slots to play with. As long as I play the new account from the registered "Primary PS4" I can use the PS+ subscription of my main account for running my secondary one.
---
I can also use my PS+ based account from another PS4 (Not Primary PS4) and have both of my accounts online and in-game at the same time.
---
I have a Furious FFR Gatling that I Primed, does great damage to SB's and Scorched.  Kills Lvl 68 Scorched with 2-3 rounds.  Ultracite 5MM is cheap to build and the Prime Gatling is very efficient with ammo.  I sit on a Fissure with a Zealots Prime LMG and nail them as they spawn and switch to the Furious Prime Gatling when they are flying.
---
Can’t be, happens to me too on Xbox and I only have TWO 76 friends and 19 Xbox friends. It’s not the cause for sure.
---
Wait... theres a 25k cap limit per character??? I need to start spending!!!
---
Also it's just common sense. I have things that are so much harder to get than the difficulty of me saving 30k caps. People who think everything should be 30k caps or less don't know how hard it is to get good rolls or don't know how easy it is to make caps
---
Also, semi related but i think it makes zero sense for fast traveling to cost caps. There are no busses or other means of traveling rather than hoofing it. But in reality, you can walk from one end of the map to the other and lose 0 caps doing so. It makes so much more sense to have fast travel cost certain amounts of food and water. Since existing in game actually consumes hunger and thirst. Just my thoughts.
---
A guy did the same thing to me ( i had a raider watch tower on the cliff overlooking the whitesprings station) i have a pirate plank for prisoner or traitor execution and baited him to walking out to me. I logged out and back in (my party member was in the world) he came back up with the angry emote and logged off.
---
Felt good man.
---
What about atomic shop things, wouldn’t they just be linked to one account? Wouldn’t you also have to re-purchase the game for the new account?
---
NW is not unplayable. You are getting an inaccurate view of that because of the negative bias of reddit. There was an uptick in hackers during the rewards week but even then, maybe 1 of 15 games had hackers. A statement like "NW is unplayable" makes someone think that 7 of 8 games have hackers. A lot of people posting about hacks in NW are new fps players that are experiencing a steep learning curve when faced against people who have a lot of experience with fps games. They get killed quickly and assume hacks.
---
Don’t think it will change anytime soon. For me its when I swap weapons. There is a distinct 2 second delay where game stops, and New weapon is equipped.
---
It's a heavy weapon with heavy and rare ammunition and also requires lots of perks to maximize damage. It's simply not worth investing and hauling it around.
---
100% agree with you. This is happening to me
---
I call BS on all of this... they raised the cap limit to 30K per character a few patches ago.
---
There are other games where the base currency doesn't mean a thing at end game, especially god teir rolls. Diablo 2 had gold that you need for repairing items, buying potions etc. but there's no way in hell you'd ever get a Breath of the dying or Enigma for gold. End game equips naturally move away for currency and into tradables in many games. The only difference is that those games have a quick and safe way to trade item for item, where fo76 has jack shit
---
Your initial post seems to be blaming Bethesda...
---
PS4 player here. Ive been freezing with weapon switching, opening map, and crafting weapons for awhile now but I agree it is worse since the last full patch... I've also noticed when fast travelling - I have to click the location I want to travel to MULTIPLE times before it even goes... Not sure what the deal is... I've had to force restart the game a couple times due to the random issues.
---
What you could have done is make or use a 2nd character (or 3rd or 4th) to get the difference then log in your main for the rest and do the trade if the item was on that character. I've only used this method with players who knew I wasn't going to cheet them. I've also done excavator power amor orders this way from people splitting up the armor over 3 characters.
---
You probably had your Super Duper perk card equipped when you ordered the original one
---
Lol. They could make it like real life where you'd have to shop at the plus size robot vendor and only could get ugly ill fitting clothes. Fat berserkers for the win though.
---
They're always part of the breach and clear event in the ash heap. As far back as I can remember.
---
Found one a few weeks ago. Super random because I hadn’t seen one before that and I’ve played a lot.
---
Why did he give you the others 25k if you didn’t interact with the low level player? What a waste, I’m sorry.
---
I know. But I want to learn them all. Think of it as similar to Pokemon
---
Huh that’s interesting. I do it pretty frequently and have never seen them. Also the second encounter was around whitespring, not even on the same server I did lode barring.
---
Fr?
---
The mode’s popularity on PC has never the less taken a significant hit.
---
Fort defiance all the surgical trays on the floors
---
It's a completely separate account, so no Atomic shop crossover.
---
Early game (on a new account) the Atoms accumulate pretty quickly due to the number of simple challenges that you forget existed after you've been playing for a while. So you can get some cosmetics pretty early on, but there is no sharing of Atomic shop items across accounts. For me it's been enough to buy the basic cosmetics that I really liked from my other account, but far from all of them.
---
Not a perfect solution, but can get you more new character slots if you don't want to give up any of your old ones.
---
They are definitely not new but they are rare in my experience.
---
Yep, some people are just dicks. I only ever put plans in my vendor, and they're all free no matter how rare. Every time someone has taken the lot its always a high level (150+) player. It's obvious that they don't need them, so you know they're just going to sell them.
---
I'm considering putting a billboard up at my camp and listing the names of people who have done it.
---
Loyal to Fallout, grumpy about decisions the corporate clowns have made and lack of simple investments they should make in the game over monetization work they have prioritized.
---
That said I am giving it another chance since I am not being forced at gunpoint to give them money, if the game is better than I thought maybe I will spend some more money. I tend to spend a lot once I perceive value for money.
---
Hey sorry i missed this got a little busy yesterday,  if you are still interested send me a DM and i will send you the link to the discord server and get you all setup
---
Thank you for your interest
---
If I come across zero cap stuff I don't take it. On the other hand if it's a three star legendary for 100 caps I'm probably buying it.
---
Bloodied, furious and junkies are probably your best bet. With my bloodied build i can 3 hit a Scorchedbeast and my biggest issue with hitting them 3 times is them making me stumble(thus interrupting my swing). This is all without any food buffs, which are **heavily** weighted in the favor of melee.
---
30k
---
I was playing a glass cannon with a 1 star bloodied mini gun for a while. Basically very low health for nerd rage, ghoulish perk with high rads. Mutations that increase strength (you'll have to look them up as I forget) and the perk that triples alcohol and drink whiskey along with psycho tats before a fight. 
---
O ly problem was everything else would 1 or 2 hit kill me lol so it wasn't that fun.
---
You can try logging out and restarting your machine. But often times, the person who show Offline or in the Main Menu are the ones that need to relog.
---
I prefer vampire / explosive. Shotguns are also very good for vats so crit damage and reduced vats cost are good too. Explosive is still my preference for secondary effect since the splash applies the cripple from the enforcer perk to each pellet meaning you can cripple most enemies in one shot. Also vampire works the same way for each pellet, you’ll get a huge heal with every shot since each pellet contributes.
---
Cool yeah that place has loads I forgot thanks!
---
You seem to have a lot of faith in humanity. Lesson learned.
---
Thank you for the explanation, I’ve already dropped a ton into the atomic shop for camp stuff and I really enjoy the base building aspect of the game so I’ll probably just wait till they offer additional character slots.
---
They have been in the game since launch. I've only encounter them twice. Three times if you count the one time in the beta.
---
I think that is a pretty weak argument.
---
If everyone in your social circle had abusive partners, would you excuse your own partner for their emotional abuse towards you because, unlike your friends' spouses, they didn't follow it up with a smack to the head? No, your partner's abuse would still be reprehensible behaviour.
---
As a game player, I don't have a consumer *relationship* with every company. It's largely relative to the games I choose to play. My *relationship* with bethesda has been tarnished by their ongoing actions with fallout 76. I am not going to excuse these actions just because they don't have meltdowns on twitter or because they pander to China.
---
I still haven't got my first, and they seem to be actively avoiding my support ticket I put in months ago.
---
Bethesda is probably the worst gaming company of this year, nobody else has as many successive fuckups as them.
---
They fully deserve the complaints they are getting, and their customers deserve what was promised to them.
---
Yeah, I'm already boiling the water twice to be sure it's boiled properly for my tea. Maybe I'll start boiling again just to be 100% sure that I won't need another one before the game prepare.
---
I think you can reset everything when hitting lvl 50. Idk if you got the option if you were already above. But you can change a skill point with every level up from lvl 50 on
---
2 shot is actually terrible for shotguns, it makes the spread so wide you have to be like 2 feet from an enemy to actually hit them with all your pellets.
---
Bollocks. If you go to a vendor and see 30 items in there for free you shouldn't have to be told that it's a dick move to take them all. Especially if most of it is stuff you don't really need.
---
I have a sign next to mine saying "Plans r free, don't be a dick". Hasn't stopped a couple of players taking the lot. You're not telling me a level 200 player needs common recipes or standard workbench plans.
---
Did you see them in the ash heap?
---
Lucky bro
---
I'm not a programer but I always envisioned it as this.  Imagine throwing a bunch of unwound yoyo's into a Box tangling them all up and then trying to remove one of them.  That's how I imagine game code.
---
mod your hunting rifle to full hardened reciever and perforating mag. will bring that up to 138 and armour piercing. huge difference. or possibly find the refined .50 cal mod/plan = 149.
---
gatling gun cannot be modded for armour and is therefore, no very good.
---
Reminds me of Tea Time! Sorry I didn't have an answer for you OP, I went for the low hanging fruit. Maybe you could ask on a GE force sub/forum and ask about slow program loading?
---
Those are stutters. Typically it happens when the game is streaming info from the hard drive. Switching weapons has always been janky in Bethesda games. 
---
As for hitting enemies, maybe the blood splatter is causing it.
---
The logical response.
---
Hey man, let him up first ya know?
---
All it would take is a wall mounted display shelf and maybe a counter top one that's the same height (and color/texture?) as the Fancy Bar set that's already in the Shop
---
Yeah they are most likely all about min-maxing stats to do it. That's why these bloodied and junkie builds are popular. By abusing the legendary effect on their weapon (bloodied = very low health while for Junkie, stacking the maximum number of addictions) and with the right perk cards, they can generate an insane amount of damage in a very short time (hits).
---
Naa save him the energy and trouble. He's gonna be down there for a while
---
Yep, once you're level 50+ you get the option to move 1 SPECIAL point (15 max for any attribute), or choose 1 new perk card for each new level gained.
---
I've respec'd a few of my toons and still have a pile of points to spare. You can also make different sized stacks of the same perk card if you want. For example, you can have Concentrated Fire at 3x, 2x and 1x card sets and swap in/out as needed (3x normal play, 2x + Green Thumb for farming)
---
they admited they made a mistake and will be bringing it back later in with your progress towards it being kept
---
I am also starting from scratch tonight on ps4, JonathanYoshee. I have previous experience from the first two months of the game but most of the content is still a mystery to me as well. Have not ventured far from the Forest really.
---
I am interested in playing thru all the content and whatever pace my team wants to do (I can always go back later to read notes and holotapes). I know a lot about the starting areas of the game and quests if you want to power thru The easy stuff.
---
Not at all, but that is a Bethesda move at this point.
---
🤣🤣
---
Nice! I didn't know that. It makes the pain a little more bearable I guess..
---
***Everything below I mean as serious as possible and welcome discussion***
---
Yes I do know the lore which is shortened as follows:
---
The vault opened with no Overseer, 52 residents, and a supercomputer (ZAX) to select the leader
---
Basic elections were held with no one becoming Overseer as they voted for themselves
---
Eventually due to not having proper authority (overseer) fighting began, with ZAX closely monitoring the outcomes and ultimately devising that conflict was the best way to pick a proper overseer.  From this he caused more and more violent encounters between the dwellers.
---
In the end only 1 dweller survived and became Overseer, eventually escaped and tried to find others (us) to help him defeating ZAX - HOWEVER - he died before this could come to be (outside of the vault).
---
SO now with that out of the way, there is nothing to say he didn't Activate/Create/Re purpose the Virtual Reality Pods to allow us to safely try to Overthrow ZAX, before escaping the vault.
---
If its not Virtual Reality (after the events that transpired) then how does the following make sense
---
1. There are no automated robots (that we can see) in the vault.  How do the Crates filled with heavy weaponry and armor get placed in the environment? (we see 1 loader, but who drives it? is it automated?)
---
2. How can the same area get burned and blackened to a crisp from the radiation storm, come back in perfect condition every time?  And also have no effect on the actual game we play in?  (these events could take place in a short future after the normal adventure mode)
---
3. How am I/the other combatants killed, coming back to life?  Sure we gain the Title at the end, but upon returning to the vault (dead people returning) we only gain a small portion of what we need to eventually access ZAX's core.
---
4. The experiments in the vault lead to the deaths of 51 people.  This was IN THE VAULT, there are skeletons yes, but where is the blood?  Where are the weapons that were brought in?  The vault is exceptionally clean, who cleaned up the mess?  The loader?
---
5. How can we beat each other to a pulp in the Vault (waiting area) and not take any noticeable damage?  How do we immediately teleport to our chosen location on the map? (sure we could be drugged and moved, but we all wake up at the exact same time)
---
It makes sense to me that we are in a re purposed Virtual Reality pod (forced or by choice) that is linked to ZAX's Main frame.  We slowly work to gain access to his mainframe to eventually finish the problem.  The only thing I'm not sure on is if the final survivor built them for us to "end it", or ZAX did to keep a live stock of dwellers.  Again this is a game, and anything make sense, but this is what I have derived from the lore and how the mode works.
---
It could be someone like myself who is making a library of sort and giving free plans/receipes to everyone who wants them.
---
Wholesome.
---
Min/max builds (maximum damage while disregarding other things, such as defence) and sneak is pretty much the meta in terms of DPS.
---
Heavy builds aren't very good sneakers because of the necessity of Power Armor to use the Stabilized perk, but the stealth-boy torso mod can help you stay hidden for longer.
---
Unfortunately, I believe the Excavator, Ultracite, and Strangler Heart Power Armor types do not have the stealth-boy mod available. Hopefully they decide to add the mod for these types of armor in the future like they did with the jetpack. Too bad they didn't include it for the Excavator armor.
---
Yes.
---
Understood, and happy to help. Hopefully it's an expansion we get to see soon!
---
Or mine
---
Caps are easy to come by. I’ll spend 25-28k and have them back in a few days. I find myself regularly buying serum plans and recall circuitboards just to get rid of them. The only thing between hyperinflation is the players that haven’t reached that point yet combined with the limit.
---
So you're taking the plans I'm giving away for free so you can give them away for free yourself? Kinda seems like you're using someone else's work and goodwill to make yourself look good dude.
---
For starters you are splitting your damage perks between two weapons, this makes them both less effected in comparison to specializing in one type of weapon. Are you using damage perks like heavy gunner, rifleman or bloody mess?
---
ALL NEW 3 COLOR SCRAPTRON BUNDLE FOR 39.99, IF YOU ORDER WITHIN THE NEXT 10 MINUTES YOU CAN GET A EXTRA FRIDGE FOR FREE!!
---
The best way I've found to hide my Fallout 1st subscription is to distract them with a dance.
---
Oh wait, no. I don't care what they think. I don't care how salty they are.
---
I recently had a couple of guys come to my camp, spend thousands of caps at my vending machines, and then saw my Scrap Box. They spent a lot of times doing the mine dupe glitch in my camp to report me. They must have thought I wasn't around, but I submitted a video of them using the exploit to Bethesda. People do stupid things when they're upset.
---
Same here. I only do the events that have a chance at dropping badges. I have a whopping 2 possum badges. Think I need 8 for the capacity upgrade.
---
Legendary Fixers are one of the most desirable weapons on 76 trading forums.  It’s the best rifle in the game.
---
I look forward to your trip to Texas, where you fix every bug and spearhead the studio into Developer of the Year.
---
patch notes are wonderful things
---
9.99 for electronic shipping and handling
---
Never had near that many caps. 
---
Soooo there's no "hey you're about to destroy X caps! Are you sure?" Popup?  Seriousl....  Why am I even surprised at this point.
---
Check out this heavy gunner build: https://youtu.be/8U6nJrc8s58
---
And this stealth commando build: https://youtu.be/NOWZtRW1oyI
---
You can add me at the same IGN as here. I'm US west coast, thought, so there might not be much crossover playtime.
---
If your asking if you can do a instant points reset, no you cannot do that. One level at a time.
---
Additional character slots improves re-playability, which in turn keeps people playing longer and possibly keep buying stuff.  The SMART decision would be to add, say, 2 more character slots to all players w/o having to unlock or purchase them, which will keep more people playing longer.  Of course now that I've said this they'll probably take the Zeni approach of monetizing all of things.
---
If another company was to produce a fallout like game, I think you would see Bethesda change, but until they have competition from a similar game they will do just the bare minimum. Who knows with outer worlds proving to be popular and Microsoft now owning Obsidian and offering good funding, perhaps the Outer worlds 2 will be some competition.
---
I didn't have any trouble unlocking them all. I just used the Super Duper perk card and crafted a few dozen of them. Maybe it's just me, but it seems like if I craft a weapon, add a mod to it, then scrap it, I'm more likely to learn a mod.
---
Hilarious and original!  I wish I could think of jokes this clever.
---
Imagine being upset that you price something for free and somebody takes it. The hell you expect? This game isn’t all ponies and rainbows. I see something free I take it, regardless of levels
---
You can do it, just bring 60 stimpacks and thousands of rounds. Not kidding, don’t want to run out. Will take a long time. Don’t die.
---
Probably sell it for 30k caps?
---
I haven't crashed or disconnected in NW on Xbox more than once in the past week. Probably played about 100 games or so.
---
I'm lucky I got told about the limit that I'm never reaching lol 
---
Still, RIP dude
---
I get these micro stutters on Xbox One as well. My brother gets them too even with a decent PC. It’s been happening for the last few months. 
---
Looking at the map, opening the Pipboy, turning the camera around, loading into a new cell, and switching weapons all seem to have a similar stutter. 
---
Honestly sometimes I see the game micro-stutter while I’m just standing still at a train station.
---
I usually prefer instigating for my gun (2x the damage when target is full health)
---
psn: iheartexo
---
My pet Murgle is a wonder; sometimes dead, then later alive again. The radiation from the day the bombs fell, mixed with who knows what kind of alien energy and mutant abilities loosed on the world, has thrown a wrench into quantum wave collapse. Science!
---
I wonder about this too. I understand if they follow with the intention of staying in the loop and hoping for improvement. What I want to know is why there are people that are so aggressive and just plain mean, and don't even play or haven't even played? I commented during Clear the Skies event once on the Fallout FB page, I think I just asked a question like when are the new updated counts available or something like that and I was met with such pure hatred. I didn't even say anything of the sort like "Love this game!" or anything. I was called a r-tard, sheep, idiot, etc. I just don't get it. I am all for speaking your mind, but it gets to be a little much sometimes.
---
I believe that your vision in wastelanders being nothing more than a few added questlines, meaningless and consequence-free decisions, and no player agency.
---
Idk why people look at wastelanders and expect it to be a soft reboot that will drive players back in throws, wake up, its bethesda you're speaking about, look at their recent actions, look at how underwhelming most of their updates and additions were.
---
Launched my first nuke after one year of playing yesterday, didn't bother till I had a buddy to do it with
---
Because a majority are fallout fans but rightfully oppose the decisions that have been made with fo76 and rightfully so and bringing up those issues warn others of the concerns brought about by a huge majority of fallout fans.
---
Because playing single player games gets boring so they come here to socialize and get attention...
---
...Or daddy issues.
---
Well that low level dude had a tonn of luck
---
There's no cap on bullets, and 5.56 has basically settled at 1:1 with caps. Spend some time server hopping and buying up all the ammo you can find, because a lot of people who are at max caps will still do trades for ammo as a substitute.
---
&gt;If it ain't broke, don't fix it, why would they change a profitable formula for a risk-taking one? Fallout 4 and Skyrim were money cows as it was. 
---
They were big sellers, yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean that Bethesda saw them as huge moneymakers -- at least not compared to what they could have done. For one thing, those games were big investments that took a long time to make. After Bethesda/Zenimax recouped those investments, how much money was left? I dunno because Bethesda is a private company that doesn't release those numbers. Also, Bethesda makes most of it money from those games based on just the sale of the base game and a lot of the copies floating around are used ones that are resold on Amazon, at Gamestop, etc. It's popular joke that Bethesda keeps porting Skyrim to new platforms but they do that because it's just about the only way that game can bring in additional money for them now. Same deal with Creation Club. Compare that to games like GTA Online, Overwatch, Fortnite or even Zenimax's own Elder Scrolls Online. They all have two revenue streams for their publishers: what players pay for a copy of the base game and then the money that the publishers get through online micro-transactions. 
---
There's a recent interview somewhere where Todd Howard notes how enduringly popular Skyrim is and then laments that they "no engagement" with those players. I.e., we have games that have still lots and lots of people playing them everyday and are therefore comparable to GTA Online or Overwatch but unlike those other publishers we're not making any money from that. There's probably higher-ups inside Bethesda who feel like chumps. Hence the desire to create Fallout 76.
---
I don't say any of the above as a defense of Bethesda and its mostly just speculation anyway (though I think pretty reasonable speculation). They should have stuck to their strengths and just made more single-player RPG games IMHO. But I get why they felt compelled to make Fallout 76. They felt like they were missing out.
---
How much do you get for a tricked out set of excavator?
---
Interesting, it was here before I stopped playing for a while as back just in time for my return lmao  
---
I genuinely thought it had just never been fixed.
---
they are just trolls and haters. I mean I don't like everything Bethesda does but regardless I find FO76 to be fun and that's in the end what matters. It obviously has plenty of players enjoying it. Bethesda has lied and I do not plan on keeping my FO 1st membership after trying it for a month. but I will still play the game. We all should have unlimited scrap storage and I will not pay for something that Bethesda clearly left out just so they could charge us and next they will allow more building space for those that pay. They are on a thin line with many players and if they were smart they would stop now. Unlike some players though I will not bash the game itself as I enjoy playing it. People are full of crap that claim its "unpayable" or that its "trash". They only hate Bethesda so they try to throw the game under the bus.
---
yeah ive been having that fast travel glitch as well, very annoying!
---
For how long was this free stuff available? How many players came by and didn't took it? 1 rotten apple will not kill the tree. Keep up the good work !
---
Whether they use a third party to ship or not, it's still on Bethesda to be accountable for shipment accuracy.
---
And this is why having a Cap limit is stupid. 30K is even dumber. 
---
Can't believe they didn't up it yet.
---
so a non fantasy mmo
---
I see this type of speech a lot on Instagram. I follow both Bethesda &amp; Fallout 76 &amp; anytime either of them post anything they are flooded with hate &amp; mean comments. If you post a comment in support of them you are automatically attacked.
---
Why? Clearly to punish you for not reading.
---
I haven't had that issue on PS4, but my frame rate plummets when I set foot in the Toxic Valley.  Tried a few different servers (including private) and it was the same across the board.  Been going on a few days now.
---
i thought they only lasted 30 min
---
Meta is usually not fun, it just is.
---
How?? I don’t exactly struggle, but I don’t think I’ve ever had more than about 10k at one time, or maybe 20k across five characters. How are you doing it? I see so many people y’all about how easy it is to get caps.
---
It could be.  Although I would say that when I see 95%, 95% seems like a plausible chance based on where I am versus the enemy.
---
They should also improve the Fat Man. I mean its supposed to be a one shot weapon, and I cant even kill a level 60 scorched with two shots of MIRV. This needs to improve significantly.
---
Nukashine irl
---
They fessed up to it and are giving everyone another shot at it in December.
---
But the short story is that they got their time zones mixed up.  It was something like they based the conclusion time on GMT instead of EST.
---
I would agree if we were talking about people not getting theirs but this is the company sending erroneous duplicates.
---
Interesting...
---
I have one character that I've had since beta that I intentionally tried to learn every mod for. My more recent character had barely made any attempts to learn anything, and that character already knows all of the Radium rifle mods. I just scrapped a few early in the game. I don't run into Radiums dropping from enemies very often. After someone told me I was full of shit when I said I had all the mods for the Radium learned, I checked both characters.
---
Totally agree with you, if what other online games have done is an indication though, it will most likely be offered for atoms. I don’t expect them to be any different and offer it for free, they’d lose out on way too much money. It would have a lot more value to me than a weapon or armor skin though.
---
Yes it is!
---
These are the same people that are messaging Todd Howard 1,000 a day and telling him that they LOVE micro-transactions and that Bethesda deserves more money for each one.
---
These people need shot out of a cannon into space.
---
It never occurred to me that I could do this. If been holding off on using my fifth spot open for Wastelanders but yeah I think I’ll create a new account for then. Thanks!
---
Oh, that makes sense. There's no additional charge to make another account on Xbox live. My main account has all of the characters that I want to build nice things with. The other account is glorified storage that I rarely use.
---
That's what mods are for!.... oh... wait...
---
I’m sorry you had to learn a lesson that way.  On the bright side, caps are painless to acquire.  One run through Harpers Ferry will clear out most of my daily 1400, and probably all of it if I had grape mentats with a beer.
---
If you have anything good that you want to sell for caps, I literally spend them on stupid shit just to not hit the limit.  
---
I bought a pile of missiles some low level guy was selling today.  I just used them with a suppressors launcher during Dead In The Water to see if it helped my melee buddy at all. Turn out it helps a little, but not enough to help him tank the mobs.  Poison damage doesn’t seem to be subject to suppression.
---
Melee hitting is still a problem for me. Sometimes it won't register as a hit. Still full damage.
---
Yao-Gaoi don't really have fur tho
---
Do you play other games on the PS4 regularly? Do they have the same problem? Does the PS4 give you an error code?
---
No if your accounts are all on the same PS4 and it's set as your primary console they share ps plus and games on that primary system.
---
welcome to the world of 5.56
---
No. Pretty lame. It's double XP tho so I leveled up 4 times in NW, which was nice
---
So slap on a mod before scrapping? Gotta try that out
---
Pick up the ammosmith perk and super duper and start to craft your own ammo. It's much more effective
---
Use something with better ammo efficiency, and don't worry about owning the most valuable workshop in the game until you are high enough level to defend it.
---
Cannot disagree with a single point, would like to, but can't
---
Literally unplayable.   /s
---
I think it was intended to only be used for performing rocket jumps, like from the quake days. Give that a shot.
---
Communism detected
---
I really like this idea, then we can make Eggnog with the Reinstag/Bramen Jizz/Milk. (Stags are boys right?)
---
Joke aside, this would be really fun, the more decorations you get done the stronger kramp-o-tron is and if you beat him you get a visit from Protec-o-Clause who has a nuka cola paintjob and gives you a Nukanog and whatever the event rewards are.
---
And ITV blog updates
---
Yes, it's been happening since launch.
---
killing legendaries too fast isn't a myth.
---
Do you run a shop? I don't play anymore, but once I had a shop going and figured out the good selling stuff, I was set. That, and figuring out cap stash spawn locations and whatever I got from looting. And events. And selling to vendors every day. Gosh, the more I think about it, the more I wonder why you don't have more. :p Just gotta look for opportunities. :)
---
Bongo, bongo, bongo, I don't want to leave the congo, oh no no no no no.
---
Uh-oh. You're gonna get banned for suggesting FO76 get fixed.
---
I can get behind that. I just wish we could equip fist weapons in power armor,  cause then you could wear the yao guai gauntlet
---
I'm sure I'm the one that doesn't understand :/
---
Psn: imaloserbaby68. Always willing to lend a hand. My wife plays sometimes too, and we wouldn't mind having a team.
---
Put your Vendors on a switch and turn them off, I also have mine behind a garage door that closes to block access to them.  Problem solved
---
Hate hog-piling is a pretty common behavior.  Just tribalism.
---
Actually, if you log into the world and check around, most people I see on Xbox do have it.
---
Eventually I gave up and purchased it as well. The private server was just too sweet to pass up. Having an exploitable tent to juke events aint bad either. Everything else is just a bonus.
---
What is the tent useful for in events?
---
There are teams of people all of whom have to be paid who work on this game. Most make between 50-75k a year. You think the amount of the fame sold this year is going to pay for them to continue working on this game if it isn't generating any other revenue?
---
If drums stop... BASS SOLO!
---
What do you think about using level 1 of the commando perks vs level 2 or 3? I'm still playing around with nukesdragons and wondering whether to skimp out and put 3-6 points elsewhere or keep points in perception to have level 3 for all the commando perks.
---
I love the game series and play almost everyday(currently at 11,000 atoms and didn't buy any) but dang this game can demoralize you with so many things just plain wrong. Played ESO and it was amazing so thought they would of done better with this game, I may hate the game currently and say all sorts of stuff against it but hopeful they will fix it from the crappy lotto system they have with legendaries or rework the perk system to make it run better but dang its like every step forward is 2 steps back sometimes and can really demoralize hardcore fanboys like me. Wouldn't hurt as much if scrap box and private servers were behind a $5 subscription not this $15.
---
its only like that if you have developers who don’t know what they are doing
---
Just need a second email address and away you go!
---
It also makes muling items between characters safer since you can rely on the character-to-character trade mechanism between two accounts instead of stuffing things in a suitcase and hoping for the best when you return... This of course relies on having access to two consoles, or being able to run two instances of the executable on PC (each console, or executable needing it's own disk/key/copy of the game).
---
BGS makes their money from the Atomic shop and subscription services, so you having more than one account is a possible win for them since nothing crosses account boundaries. Their hope is you buy stuff more than once to have whatever it is on each account.
---
Don't server hop? Its borderline exploit behavior in itself.
---
I would be happy enough already with the PA-Hands being styled as bearpaws actually
---
No freezing, but the search can sometimes take up to 30 seconds (by this point i'm already off in another direction), though sometimes it is almost instant... weirdly inconsistent.
---
Well I was hoping to not buy a second PS4! So yeah I won’t be able to mule between my accounts but that’s fine.
---
It's not freezing, just delayed response from the server, handshaking or something.
---
Do something, 200ms\~ of delay, result.
---
takes so many 1*'s to get to daily script cap. Since they are the majority of the drops gotten, i could see why they would drop very frequently. 30 1* a day for 1.5 3*'s at the vendor
---
they did up it from 20k to 25k and then now to 30k. the reason why there is a limit is due to cap and duplication exploits
---
I would definitely love shelves that we can fully stick with stuff.
---
I run a bar in Morgantown as my CAMP and I would love to make it looked stocked with drinks and alcohol.
---
il pass, what we really need is a cap sink and a weapon/effect rebalance.  a cap sink would raise the value of caps, and a rebalance would make useless effects better to on par with even the mid runner effects.
---
&gt;all other weapons are more or less worthless
---
this has been since day 1, why run a basic weapon when you can hunt for something that will be better suited to your build?
---
&gt;why upgrade the crafting perks when crafting armor
---
if you are not using these perks to make raid armor you are really kicking your teeth in
---
&gt;If they lowered the cap then more people would be likely to spend just to spend since its capped
---
possible but unlikely,  we already have a market problem because of no cap sinks, some items go for 150k+ caps because lack of value and its stupidly easy to cap transfer on a mule, which negates the whole "cap limit"
---
&gt;I had all the food recipes by around level 25-30 because so many are easily found or sold cheap.
---
its cheap because most recipes are not useful, cant remember the last time my herbivore made anything thats not corn soup or raw melons.  melee benefits the most because of meat stacking
---
Yes, but they're very subtle. I'm used to laggy games, so it doesn't bother me.
---
I’ve come back to my camp before to see that a scorchbeast queen corpse had fallen on top of it
---
Food buffs are pretty important in this game. It would make sense you would have all of them at a low level, although i very much doubt you do. 
---
Caps are dirt at this point and will continue to be. Mostly because of the readily available serum sales.
---
Yeah- imagine that getting unleashed further?  ;)
---
You get the upgrades by scraping the paddle ball so make like 15 then scrap it. It really depends on how many mods there are and make them lvl 5 for less resources cost
---
i have purchased and scrapped a few of them to test now (about 10) i have learned no mods from this process.  i have also not seen mod plans in the token vendor or any vendors for it.
---
as it stands with no mods imo its not very fun, just burns rubber from making the ammo just to plink things to death at 1 damage/hit
---
Thats very cool. What system you on?
---
They don't deserve you
---
Playing on PC :)
---
So you get the plan when you purchase it from Camden Park?
---
Without giving too much away, it is indestructible, and can be placed virtually anywhere.
---
If you really want to find out more, check youtube. But I don't want to give Bethesda any more information.
---
I cant really confirm this because I haven't gotten the plan so idk
---
30server hops* i'm way drunk or what
---
If you're instigating sneak, rifleman is good. You waste less ammo, but the dps is much lower. I run rifleman on my main, for queen switch to heavy. You have to run a lot of guns full health. Bloodied, just one gun basically.
---
They should just remove the limit on caps altogether. It would result in an initial period of insanity where nobody knows how to price anything (not much different from now), but would eventually allow the market to establish a real baseline value for caps. 
---
As it stands they’re effectively worth zero or less, with most sellers of desirable items preferring to trade for other items or use 5.56 in place of caps.
---
Why?  Because these train wrecks are *hilarious*.  
---
Seriously.  While I feel for you guys getting boned by this company's poor decision making skills, from the outside its great entertainment.
---
Does the Yao-gui PA automatically knock down or  stagger everything it touches?
---
Don't worry, Bethesda wouldn't check this thread for that kind of info lol
---
I pull everything out of those vending machines, then drop it in a bag right in front of them.
---
I don't know why.
---
Can you pass along a link to show where we can learn to craft the paddle ball? The wiki says the only way to get them is by spending tokens: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Paddle_ball_(Fallout_76)
---
No, but I did get twice the number of PA editions when they first shipped them.
---
2.48m Sales since 2018, let's cut that in half since you only want to count 1 year. We'll assume the game has costed every person $30 to account for the sales and ect.
---
2,480,000 x $30 = $74,400,000
---
And that's not counting whatever whales have blown on the atom store, that probably exceeds their sales margins by far.
---
A development team of around 20-30 sounds ideal, which by your maths, $50-75k would be their wage.
---
Assuming Bethesda's staffteam is paid that (and do close to nothing in work for that money, even according to other game companies standards) it's still only going to cost $1M-1.5M per year to run.
---
Do I think they can afford it? I know they can. They're worth fucking $2.5B
---
No OP obviously but here's my take.  I'm getting pretty bored with it and see myself taking a break pretty soon until Wastelanders is released.
---
A typical session for me is doing the dailies/weeklies and spending a bit of time hanging out with some people I've met in game.  So many events have significant downtime built in and take much longer than they need to for the amount of effort required to complete them.  Once I'm ready to log out, I sell my 1400 caps of stuff to a vender and script my useless legendarily and log out.
---
At this point I would mod the heck out of previous TES and FO games because I'm down to radiant style quests and then quit playing when I'm done with the mods.  All there is left in FO76 are radiant quests and I can't mod.  If it wasn't for the peer pressure (and there isn't much) from my online friends, I would have quit a while ago.
---
I've run the vaults a couple of times but honestly the rewards don't seem worth it for the amount of ammo I expend getting through them.  SBQs are also getting old as, once again, the amount of ammo I use doesn't seem worth the rewards.  I've tried going the "find all the plans" endgame route but that seems unnecessarily difficult both because some plans have impossibly low drop rates and I wouldn't even know when I'm done since I don't know of an exhaustive authoritative list of all possible plans.
---
No 40k... Seriously 556 dude you put 6 600 or 6k in your shop they sell lol. That's how I build up my collateral anyway. I have around 100k 556 at anyone time as soon as I get down to 5/6k I put 12-15k 556 in my shop they sell in about 3 hours max and I'm back at 20k i put an order of 556 in I get 30k-40k off my ammo trader and off I go again.
---
Like I said I dont have the paddle ball plan so I cant confirm and I never said I got it from the wiki
---
Or just remove the cap limit for everyone. It's bogus.
---
Google the interactive fo76 map so you can find the lead deposits.  Then build camp next to one.  Good for steady stream of lead.  You’ll get enough steel from everyday adventures.
---
To simplify things, fixing bugs is alot like playing Jenga, with code.
---
haha fair enough. Once you do, message me and you can mod mine for a fair price
---
My friend has one already, so that's not a worry
---
No you didn't say you got it from the wiki, but it sounded like you got that information from somewhere. Making up answers isn't as helpful to others as you may think, eh?
---
+karma thanks buddy
---
Ah loved guildwars. You should have blown him a new asso xD
---
Fuck. I was waiting for this post!!!!! My game freezes for 10 seconds at a time. I have never had this problem before this patch.
---
You ever heard that Bruce Lee quote about the kicks? It applies pretty well to 76. Sure it does a lot of things, but it kinda falls flat in regards to other games that may not have as many things, but the things it does are done a LOT better.
---
The definition of a "Master of None".
---
The same thing has happened with Elder Scrolls Online. It's a crate scam grind fest now. I need a new game....
---
Assuming that you use the same account from two different PCs.
---
Is it possible that the game was still running on your home PC and it "woke up" while you accessing the game from your laptop? If so, the home PC may have connected to your account and taken precedence over your remote/laptop connection which would spawn that message.... just a thought.
---
Well in my case, I do love the game, and want it to do better but I hate what Bethesda is doing to it and are treating it's playerbase. I'd be willing to be a majority of those classified as "haters" are just like me in that regard, but any criticism we've brought forth in the past (and currently) has been met with "you're just hating the game" and "you don't even play the game" instead of addressing our concerns, anger or criticism (not saying you're one of them just that this is generally the case.) I played the game regularily right up until Fallout 1st (I've pretty much had enough) but I still follow the game and get involved because I'm still holding out hope. I wouldn't be surprised if that's the case with a lot of us.
---
My 556 never seems to sell.
---
Has something to do with AMDs I heard
---
Make and sell ammo. I bought all the serum recipe, and all the plans in watoga from farming materials for ammo.
---
Yep. Lever action reload (fixed), sinking wall cabinets, conduit ceiling light that is a floor piece. These are the lost infuriating. Don’t port it over if if you’re not going to fix it first.
---
I had this and somewhat accidentally discovered it was the windows page file (virtual memory)  basically everything stopped while waiting on my hdd. Moved the page file to another drive and it largely went away. 
---
I ahd stupidly(?) Put the page file on a "storage array"
---
Still 25 in trade. They should fix that to 30 at least.
---
A lvl 5 1star legendary is worth the same amount of scrip as the lvl 50 1star  legendary.  I dont think that person was intentionally trying to screw over a low level player, they probably just need to sell out the scrip vendor for the day and ran out of stashed legendaries.
---
Rest peacefully knowing your brothers in the big wasteland in the sky now. Hes in a radioactive place now.
---
For full health build I recommend Furious and Vampires (if using fast fire rate guns)
---
Brilliant, well done. Love the rigging effect
---
I'm a melee/heavy build.  For melee, I like vampire weapons, but when reach for a  ballistic weapon, I'll usually be either an AA LMG or troubleshooters gatling.  (I don't have anything with explosive as a secondary attribute).  
---
Either of those is quite effective.
---
They have sales?
---
Damn, nice work!
---
If you are willing to part with it pm me. 🤞
---
True but a lot of the issues are just lazy design. All of the incorrect naming issues, some of which are still not fixed.
---
Something as simple as having 2 different plans with identical name, spelling errors, extra spaces between words, etc.
---
It’s just bad game design.
---
VATS working only sporadically on my LMG. Strange.
---
Because if they do fix things they can get more new people who will also buy them. Seriously didn't you read what I just wrote?
---
Ok well my point is if you're choosy about who you want to take your stuff for free then don't put it where anyone can take it for free. No amount of reddit posting will stop people from doing it. Personally if I see free shit in a machine I take only what I need. Free 5.56 or stims? Doesn't matter if I'm level 50 or 150 I'm takin that. Plans and shit I don't know? Same. I will leave anything I don't need, but if someone has a sign that says "don't be a dick" I might take the shit and drop it by some low levels just to piss them off for dangling free stuff for players and calling the ones who take it dicks.
---
That's the reason? On ps4 i fight queens with that and shotgun and don't see a drastic fall in the players number.
---
Cheers! The whole thing kinda evolved over several months. Like, at first I ran with missile turrets (since those are the closest to cannons), but they ate up so much budget...
---
But then the weapon displays rolled around and I finally found a use for those goddamn useless broadsiders lol
---
That also freed up enough budget to expand the sails and do some rigging :D
---
Exactly. 556 is the desired currency now and people want 50k caps or more for items. Caps are near worthless now. With everyone running commando and FFR,ammo cant be replaced fast enough. Which in a real wasteland situation would be true ammo and water would be the most valueable items.
---
Take for example manhunts in division’s darkzone. That was an excellent example of risk/reward for being “bad”.
---
I'm not surprised you are proud, my friend - this is a masterpiece! I wish I could come and visit you in my (not very pirate-y) pirate costume.
---
Thanks for the insight , interesting to note dead characters dont deal any damage that must be where im going wrong! lol.. I was just trying to understand the formula for retaining workshops and I think you have confirmed this, being a  ombination of full health and weapon with decent DPS.
---
I wish I could say the same..
---
Lately
---
Download more FPS.
---
It's just me knockin em all down
---
Imagine screwing yourself over then underestimating the damage because you messed up simple subtraction.
---
That's tough, chief.
---
I asked about this yesterday, sounds like it was fixed.
---
I get them in usually 2 or 3 hops, but 30 and no crickets? That's some bad luck. If you have someone to team up with you can go punch a cricket in Tanagra, while your friend waits there, fast travel to uncanny and get close to the map marker, then have your friend kill the cricket. The challenge should complete. No server hop necessary. Or try for server hop 31. ;)
---
&gt; functional game at launch, and we still don't have that
---
Did the definition of Functional change? 
---
*1. of or having a special activity, purpose, or task; relating to the way in which something works or operates*
---
*2. designed to be practical and useful, rather than attractive*
---
*3. working or operating*
---
The hundreds of hours many people have in the game show that it is functional. Bug-free and Stable no, but it is Functional.
---
No sorry. I've already arranged to give it to a friend who never received there replacement canvas bag.
---
Hows that pay for convenience?
---
Same. I still log in and play a few times a week, but it’s definitely slowed down over the past month.
---
The frustrating thing is that the game has so much potential and an already established brand. If it were complete crap nobody would be playing it. A lot of people (myself included) are just frustrated by the way Bethesda has managed it and want it to reach its full potential.
---
Yep, you get kicked out of dungeon. I got to boss, took me 45 min, and then died (ran out of stims) Have to start over from beginning
---
a 16-bit number goes up to 65k. Why the fuck would they cap it at 30k? This game is a failure i should have never wasted my money.
---
Is the NW double XP apply in anyway to Overseer Rank or is it just Character level that is affected?
---
Lowest damage is just you, the weapon, and whatever appropriate perks you happen to have.
---
highest damage achieved by all of these simultaneously: modded legendary weapon or tricked out non-legendary + appropriate bobblehead + food bonus + chems + perks.
---
That's why you put them on mules.
---
Yep .. for Ghouls , Glowing, scorched no matter how much damage you give in the first swing, even 2500 on a level 9..it leaves about 10% health.  Sometimes 2nd and 3rd swing doesn't register any damage either. VATS just stops working after one shot for me
---
It happens on Fallout 4 aswell, it usually happens when your weapon has a camo or skin on it. It takes extra time to load the textures and so it 'freezes' the game while it loads them.
---
1: use melee weapons when farming for ammo materials. 2: sell stuff you can find in peaceful ways, make caps, buy ammo from player vendings.
---
Well I do think there's a difference between those that do like the game but are critical of it &amp; those that just straight up trash talk the game regardless of what's happening to it. I see both kind &amp; can normally tell them apart.
---
This sounds very similar to the berry mentats/sensor helmet bug that was causing massive lag before they patched it to only affect the initial user back in the day.
---
It could be a combo of that minigun and the armor effect.
---
You could run what you want too. Put in 3 grim reapers sprint and run high luck for crits. I have all mods for handmade. Like to run stabilized barrel and true stock. For commando, both stabilized would be good. On my bloodied run both mods true. Grim seems to proc enough that it doesn't matter much in vats unless you're over encumbered.
---
Cloth and acid, the yield is pretty high too.
---
How is a Junkie's build abusing the effect? It's using it exactly as intended.
---
I still think it's underrated. There wouldn't be a new post here every two minutes if it wasn't popular.
---
I really don't mind the monetization. I'm paying because I don't want Wastlanders to be the last thing we get. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
That being said anytime I get close to 1000 hours in a game it's money well spent. 
---
I love this game, I really like the community, and I don't give the smallest shit what the internet (and especially Kotaku) say about it.
---
I've got my guy as big as he can get and I've never had any outfit issues...other than them looking completely unflattering which is exactly what is expected.
---
This is the first shop camp that I’ve seen that I actually like. GG broski
---
Oooof... thats rough hahahaha
---
It's not about being choosy. You're saying you only take stuff you need or plans you don't know. We're talking about people who take everything regardless of whether they need it or not. It's a dick move anyway you cut it. I'm not gonna spend my time following low levels around the map to give them stuff, so I put things in the vendor for free. That's not really a licence for some level 200 to snatch the lot so he can stick it in his vendor for silly prices. Are people really so hard up for caps that they need to take advantage of someone else's good will just to make a bit extra? 
---
Bottom line: if you need it then take it, if you don't need it and still take it you are a dick. Simple.
---
You're definitely losing out by buying those recipes, if you mean from MODUS.
---
Worse news for you... two shot is broken on missile launchers. It gives you exactly 1 extra damage because on a missile launchers the ballistic damage is fixed at 1 and the projectile does all the explosive damage at the point of impact. The two shot prefix applies only the the ballistic damage, not the explosive damage.
---
If they patched this already someone correct me, but I'm pretty sure this bug is still present.
---
Like way  down.
---
If you stick with a rifle build, I have found instigating guns (lever action and handmade) to be really strong, especially in sneak mode. Mister Sandman is a really good perk to invest in. (Bloodied would probably be more powerful, but I like to have full health.)
---
You out everything in a vending machine for free, at that point you lose all claim to them and it doesn't matter who takes them.
---
It's what's gonna happen. Either sell it for cheap, don't watch who takes it, or you continue to set yourself up and leave yourself over to watch people be gluttons. The choice is yours
---
c o n s e l l a t i o n
---
you do not get the plan, its a single item that you purchase
---
When did you start playing?
---
But new people already are. Most retailers are selling the game for $5 or $10. It's basically free to get into. And when something is near free, it's more incentive to spend some money on microtransactions. And if people are already right now spending money on microtransactions for a broken game, why wouldn't new players also spend money on microtransactions for a broken game?
---
Do you get blue screened everytime right before the news page shows up?
---
When you buy the Paddle Ball you only get the weapon, there is no way to learn how to craft it.  
---
And the mods are NOT in the game.   
---
Please, don't scrap any more Paddle Balls, it breaks my heart to see so many tokens wasted...
---
I hate when they do that. Trying to stop a few people exploit their poorly made game and it wrecks it for everyone else.
---
This was completely on OP, chief.
---
rekt
---
Wastelanders will not be on a test server. Absolutely no way they will want people getting an early look at it.
---
Are you on PS4?
---
A car that breaks down every 5 minutes is 'functional', but that doesn't mean it's bearable.
---
Mb, councellation*
---
You can definitely get good legendaries for 25-50.
---
&gt; if someone wants to buy something that would make the vendor go over it shouldnt let them
---
If something is in the Vendor then you should be able to buy it, period. Why would the buyer be punished for something they have no control over.
---
To be fair, I could see a car like og Fallout but engine just can't handle it.
---
&gt;That's pretty annoying, and I fully agree that it's common decency to leave freebies for others that need them.
---
Well how do you decide who needs them? To me, that's stuff that can be scrapped and used to make other things.
---
Laugh in TF2
---
Who?
---
It's been like that since consoles became dominant. I still remember when everyone in hals quake 2 server had pretty high iq's. Being there meant you were at least 75 iq.
---
I'd love to hear how.
---
You've obviously never lost 10k because of this flawed system.
---
god tier weps are already high; I bought B2525 Handamde for 150k caps two days ago.
---
No, he gave OP all 50k. OP lost 38k, that's their fault only.
---
It's not due to limitations, it's just a limit to prevent inflation.
---
c o u n c e l l a t i o n
---
\*5.56 enters the room\*
---
Me on PS4 this always results in a bluescreen.
---
Not i do have a problem where if I try to cook or repair it takes forever and on some occasions ive had to force quit because i was stuck in the workbench.
---
It seems Bethesda foregot to optimize the patch before it rolled out.
---
Lags others too. If I see someone in it at Encryptid, I’m out.
---
Why not just have it be an outfit like the imposter sheepsquatch outfit? Not everyone uses PA and it costs 2x more when it’s a PA skin.
---
Bye
---
Thats not the point he made lol
---
Sheepsquash is a cryptid and you can use the skill. That's more about animal/mutated animals vs humans/mutated humans.
---
They should make 30k cap limit, but when you spend some of those 30k it gets replenished by the other caps not in your offical "caps"
---
I always sort of thought the disproportionate outrage was because the fans here care more than maybe your average fan elsewhere does.
---
Got a Junkie's Explosive railway rifle as a drop a while ago so decided to try out a build around it. Not too badly debuffed with the addictions I have (Daddy-o, Daytripper, Buffout, Psycho, and Mentats) and the legendary effects on my scout armour compensate for the most part. I've since collected a few more weapons to go with it, pretty fun doing 150+ damage with a faster swing speed combat knife when I feel like melee.
---
Where’s that at ?
---
I think it's ok
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Rather than having the game changed to suit how you want to make caps, perhaps it's you who should change your vending strategy to fit what players buy.
---
True you need about 1850 to buy one.
---
In VATS, auto does more damage, one hit with an auto shots something like 3 bullets.
---
ok.. thanks for the update...
---
so long!
---
The missile launcher should absolutely be one of the one go-to anti-scorched beasts weapons. With the tracking mod it's basically purpose-built for that (anti-air).
---
i did it about 2 months ago for science, the way i see it is that my small break from buying other things may save someone from running through and trying to get mods then raging about wasting them.  at least i can warn them upfront.
---
I was sent two months ago
---
I did have to sell something for 15K instead of 17K that i had agreed to because my vendors had a few good sales but thats on me. I could have easily turned them off or taken my valuable items out of the Vendors until i could transfer caps or do another high end deal (or buy a serum recipe) but that my own fault because i didnt. Not something my patrons, who have done nothing wrong, should be penalized for.
---
Haha been a while since I heard that one.
---
It's seriously bad, borderline abusive, game design to allow the transaction to proceed without warning you about cap room.
---
I still struggle to understand people reasoning with making these posts. No one is asking you to stay, you dont need our permission. Just leave. 
---
Im not trying to be cold or anything. Im simply asking you listen to your own feelings instead of feeling the need to shout them from the rooftops and get offended when people react negatively.
---
Lil woosh eh
---
I've always been able to pick the safes I know about, but maybe you have worse luck?
---
post your build -  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) 
---
While you are at it take time to read every single perk description as the answer to your question is all there.  From there it's time to move on to more advanced theorycrafting by understanding legendary effects -  [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)   
---
Spend enough time fiddling with those 2 resources and you will answer your own question ;)
---
I’m sorry I’m not sure what that means. If you mean max on rifles and like nothing for anything else then yeah that’s kinda what I’m going for. Or maybe a rifle and explosives build
---
Hi everyone! We're looking into these reports. If anyone has any videos of this happening can you please send them my way? This way we can take a look and see where this studdering is happening and during what actions.
---
100% agree. Bethesda hasn’t been graceful with their decisions for this game, but I can’t blame them for not seeming to want to engage with the fan base.  It’s a two way street, and relationships don’t work when constructive communication is abandoned.  We as a community need to step up as much as we expect them to.  The sarcasm, insults and negativity dominating this sub can’t possibly be helping anything.

---
got fucked like this some time ago. it's straight up fucking stupid that there is a cap for caps in the first place.
---
Why do I have a feeling this guy has never played the game?
---
I completed the challenge 90% afk.
---
There's no assured way to get a specific legendary effect on a specific weapon outside of a few fixed quest rewards.  
---
The only way to get  an AA lever is to get lucky with a drop or find one for sale on a vendor.
---
Yeah but the cost penalty should be the only cost, and more severe.
---
This article needs to be included in the sub's is-this-game-right-for-me catch up article thing. It's a decently comprehensive summary of the game's history.
---
Of course they are greedy, it is not like ongoing online games need to pay for offices, salaries and servers. They should be happy they got a single payment for the game when we bought it and then the developers can work for free from a garbage dump. 
---
Yup. Greedy corporation, wanting to pay their rents and give paychecks to their employees. 
---
Bye now!
---
https://www.giantbomb.com/min-maxing/3015-128/
---
I’d like to encourage others to quit to hold the developer accountable for the way they have treated their customer base. 
---
The more we condone Bethesda’s downright abuse, the more we as a community get shit on. 
---
Look what they did to the creator of Map76. Look how many bug fixers they banned. 
---
I’m honestly looking to either change someone’s mind or maybe have mine changed about why I should continue to sink my time and energy into this game
---
Try it out and report back.
---
I dont remember who put out a video of how to do this dupe glitch but it's a nice one.
---
I don't like the cap either, but I also dont think they have a handle on the cheating as of yet. If thats not locked down, I can see the economy going to shit in a hurry. 
---
Having a think about whether or not caps are worthless...well, I spend caps on fast travel, plans, and the occasionally legendary. I'm usually in the 4-8k range for caps..never really trying to make money, ill sell my plans for 10-50 caps. I dont typically sell to the 1400 cap limit each day, maybe every few days if i get time to play. I used to spend money on some of the harder to find junk (ballistic material)..until I found good places to farm (and got better repair perks), but haven't really had a need to do that for some time. So for me, as it stands, I dont really use my caps for much, but when i need them they're there. Are they wortheless then? I dunno. They're nice to have in a pinch and i think without a cap, prices would be astronomical.
---
Buy a secont RTX 2080ti and make a SLI. You should get +5-10fps
---
Thanks! Not only do we have style, we also have very reasonable prices :)
---
Could it also be because it is not meant to be traded and people found a workaround?
---
Maybe?
---
Oh look, thing isn't on my server, time to go to another one! Oh look, that thing is here! Oh golly g thanks Mr. Howard.
---
Someone did this before &amp; saw low levels only take what they needed while the high levels stripped the vending machines dry.
---
I guess that's a noble cause but it might've prevented by just researching how to obtain them, there are posts dating 11 months ago where dataminers confirmed they are cut from the game.
---
Oh, well. As least you're not sad about it.
---
Yup, got the same problem. Anyone knows how to turn down/off those kind of particle effects in the .ini on PC?
---
It’s reddit. So I expect a relatively negative response, but honestly you should be outraged too and I’d like to know if others are as well.
---
I've always kinda felt that the legendaries should be like old school perks where they have a bonus trait but it also comes with an associated malus.
---
For instance, you have TSE but it makes you take twice as much explosive damage while equipped.
---
This makes the legendaries situationally unique but also let's crafted gear maintain a baseline performance.
---
TSE handmade is still one of the best out there, even though it was overduped. Some will tell you its accuracy is bad, that’s because they rely on vats/aimbot, just use your own aim and it’s a real beast - and you can run on full health.
---
No. You make a game financially successful by making a good game, not by squeezing out pennies through the noses of the players.
---
Kinda seems like they do in fact develop it from a garbage dump given the quality of the product.
---
Yeah kind of that. We have a group with different min-maxing so we all have our uses
---
Dont really have a fix for you but I run an rtx 2060 and ryzen 2600x.  No fps drops for me whatsoever.    I run off an SSD and my video card drivers are at least 4 months outdated.  Not sure if either of those things contribute to my performance compared to yours though.  My computer is used almost exclusively for gaming though so I have little else installed and running in the background.
---
I do occasionally play on an older computer though with a gtx1060 and amd fx8350.  Whitespring and parts of Morgantown will drop me way down around 20 fps on that machine though.
---
For me the weapon switch freezes happen with weapon wheel or pip-boy, it doesn't matter.  It's been happening for like 6 months here, xb1 x.
---
fyi- I can clear up one of my freezing problems (brief freezes after stopping movement) by taking a speed demon serum. I have the speed demon mutation. It doesn't clear them all up, but that one particular freeze problem goes completely away while under serum effect.
---
I introduce my camp by welcoming anyone who comes by to "Hope Bunker" 
---
While I am 100% with you OP we can already kind of do this, just not on the map.
---
Also we can't even display character names sooooo.
---
Then you'll want bloodied or junkie build.
---
You sure it's actually running on your dedicated GPU and it's not trying to run on the integrated graphics?
---
There's a setting in the nvidia software to force fallout76.exe to run on the nvidia GPU. It should auto select it but sometimes that goes wrong for some reason.
---
The cheating problem is not that big on consoles. From what i read on PC it is. I mezelf am a console player and understand there has to be a line somewhere. I player a lot of ark before fo76. No limit what so ever and the market was just fine as is. I know different game different rules, just really not what im used to anymore.
---
No, because I brought it up a *lot* and asked for it to be banned from trading several times because it wasn't meant to be traded. The owner thought people were just dropping them to trade but it wasn't the case. He came around though because I'm pretty sure he watched a video
---
Having worked in the industry, do you honestly believe Bethesda has it in them to fix these issues by Wastelanders? Track record seems to indicate otherwise.
---
I think the cap limit is a bad idea in general. If players over price their stuff it simply will not sell, the artificial limit hurts the game economy. Particularly if you have some in game items from vendbots that cost 20k (yes I know eat some chems or perks may help that).
---
In the early days of the game I could clear thousands of caps a day just trading basic supplies to people (was trying to act as a buy/sell broker though the trade interface prevented that). That was when I felt I was doing a bad job at it too and had trouble makin gun deals.
---
Now with vendors and hopefully bugbfixes (I guess I will find out tonight) I would expect a merchant oriented character could easily clear 2-3k per day wiping out the vendbots and doing basic supply sales to players. 
---
Making transactions hard capped helps no one, it just leads to substitute currencies (usually low weight high value items). And a cumulative cap is just foolish, especially one so close to in game transaction amounts.
---
Anyway my plan for dealing with the 30k cap is to just spend like a fish and offer quests to people. Let my inability to hoard a fortune result hopefully in some amusement to others as I clear out thousands of caps so I can keep my trade flow going. 
---
Another option is for trusted players to form credit systems, if anyone wants a Fallout 76 based credit union I could probably design one for you (need to design transactions with safeguards for griefers and transparent stores of value, and also build trust).
---
This is what I do: I save up to 1000, then spend 150-500. I do this on multiple characters and it's pretty useful.
---
im pretty sure it was also banned because iirc its not supposed to be tradeable.
---
  and the problem does exist on xbox but nowhere near as bad as on the pc version.  my xbox can normally recover after about 10 seconds when stacks start expiring
---
What makes you think they value us?
---
That is quite possibly the worst spelling of purveyor I have ever seen lol also who the fuck knows. Check Bethesda’s website for updates.
---
I'm on xbox and only have a problem when fighting the Queen. I use an exploding gattling plasma with a splitter, that's 10 acid prices every round and it fires stupid fast haha
---
Ill only spray her for a few seconds before turning to clear mobs. But even fighting normal sb and the imposter I have no problems laying into them
---
Looked at your post from yesterday.  Search on Reddit sucks sometimes.  Maybe I'll buy a cheap, crap 3 star to try it out on first.  Some Nocturnal, 250 dmg resistance, plus 1 Intelligence POS for 500 caps.
---
You donating me a 3 star pump to try.  LOL.
---
Good on you! The world accepts your opinion. Ps I agree.
---
We've only had 2 sales ever? Its hard to say when the next one will be.
---
I loved doing that event for the very reason that it fed everyone. Now I just don't bother anymore.
---
Getting rid of a cap on caps would be better imo
---
Black Friday is in 2 weeks. It would certainly make sense for them to offer an in game sale at the same time as the real world spending frenzy. But making sense is not necessarily the Bethesda way.
---
So what you basically are saying is that friends are fun? Same thing kept me to the game for longer then it deserved. But then most of us just left in silent, guess we just had enough.
---
I still check the game and follow the ”discussions”, they always find new ways to get the wrong type of pr. lol
---
Cool idea! I wish we had more (any) animal armors in general, imagine Deathclaw leather armor, Mirelurk Shell armor, Radscorpion Carapace armor, etc. So many possibilities!
---
I like this idea, I would also like it if other players could ~~break~~ lockpick into your vendors and steal said caps.  Get some heisting in this and have that Wanted system get a bit more use.
---
Ooo ballin, you obviously don't get my point from the post, but other people that have my problem will so no worries there. I know that you can take all the valuables out of your vendor, or turn it off, but I dont want to spend an hour sitting through the lag just to transfer things to and from my vendor, your "patrons" aren't being penalized here if this becomes a thing transfer some caps (Since you obviously love to transfer) to a different vendor then they can buy whatever the want, and when ALL of the vendors are full that's when you, ya know, switch and transfer. What we shouldn't have to do it to seek out something to buy to just sell something from our vendors.
---
&gt;Another guy mentioned that it might be because of the acid cloud visual effect on the enemy
---
this guy is correct afaik,  i haven't seen that it got patched anywhere but the particles lag the fuck out of certain graphics cards.  
---
the problem gets exponentially worse with energy weapons, especially if they are explosive legacies or have the burn damage mod
---
I do similar keeping my scrip bank near max, but spending around 150 a day, unless I stroke RNG gold then I will spend a few hundred more and build it backup.
---
I got a crappy one, and then I got the canvas one. So two total, but not two canvas ones.
---
Ya but only like 100 caps at a time
---
What a bargain.
---
You're gonna burn in hell.
---
He admitted to using an exploit. Even if just in testing, the act itself is a violation of TOS. He knew that going into it. 
---
It sucks what happened to him, it really does. But expecting bans for some and not for others is unfair from any viewpoint.
---
This would be my advice as well.
---
That said, this game is pretty unoptimized and fps drops in WS, at Scorched Earth or anywhere where a bunch of people are firing explosive auto guns is common.
---
I usually can get the daily vendor max just from selling food and meds that I pick up and cook or dilute without even going out of my way. I guess I need to figure out how to get good cap flow through my own vending though. I've never gotten a good grasp on it.
---
It being untradeable wasn't the reason, we had talked about it multiple times before. It did become part of the reason but ultimately it was because people were being griefed by it. His trade discord/sub is the most legitimate and he wanted to make sure that it stayed legitimate. They really try to curb dupers/exploiters from their community so it's a great thing he changed his mind on it. The owner is a good dude
---
lol definitely a worthy investment 😂
---
I think it’s always important in any situation to consider the case. Like, what if we applied that same rule to people who murder others in self defense? They technically broke a law, therefore they should go to jail? I don’t accept that logic, and think Bethesda could have at least considered the situation. Most of their games have been patched up to playability by PLAYERS, and that’s what this guy was trying to do.
---
Happy trails man...
---
Goes back to scrapping.
---
Fuck. Thanks.
---
Ye well, people have blamed the engine for a long time and I start to believe that the restrictions for it are horrifc. I know nothing about coding but still I can see and get around the ”limitations”.
---
😂😂😂
---
I feel like we should be able to "disenchant" legendaries for a bit of legendary material that can be saved and applied to gear we want
---
Not disenchanted a 1:1 ratio but but like for every 10 scraped you can put a 1star of your choosing on a piece of crafted gear then maybe 20 to add the second and a big 50 for the third to finish it off as an endgame piece
---
Is the game still full of bugs etc? Wanting to pick it up soon as I haven't played it yet
---
TSE does break super fast so you have that going for you, Bloodied you die much easier, Junkies has addiction penalties, ...
---
Ooh nice idea for a quest, design a heist for players and bait it with loot.
---
It kinda is, but only in CQC. And being in CQC with PA is... not optimal.
---
I agree that every case should be considered individually. An abuse of an exploit and its punishments are very clearly outlined in their TOS. 
---
Do I think he should be banned? No. But I wasnt really ever asked either, he broke the rules and was punished. I do think it was a bit too harsh of a punishment though, but that isnt up to the community. And imo, it never will be.
---
go for it.  good hunting
---
Okay cool. Cheers!
---
I think that players and consumers should have more of a say in how the products they keep alive are governed. 
---
I am a flagrant communist though so I guess that makes sense.
---
I clear out the vendor cap every day. I dont sell anything to other players. Once a week I buy one of the expensive plans from the watoga vendor. Rinse, repeat.
---
Are you borderless?  Look through this:  https://steamcommunity.com/app/377160/discussions/0/1474222595305134004/
---
lol yeah. but just sharing a fix for a dumb challenge. This one's not as bad as asking someone to not wear power armor in a nuke zone or a behemoth and a mutant hound or any challenge that has anything to do with vault 94.
---
Thank you very much for this, this is like exactly what I needed
---
What if they wanted to make a section for people who've lost their characters to separate them from requests that should be reviewed and helped, as they cannot restore characters? Makes sense to me, although I do not know how that is in reality.  
---
Anyway, congratulations, you seem to be free now and can play something decent instead.It makes
---
Almost as nice as the civil war top hat back in the day lol
---
Is two shot or explosives a better secondary?
---
ok, yeah I agree with you there.
---
geez to many people in the fallout community so butthurt over everything. you don't like it don't play it. it's as simple as that smh
---
It's awful, I can't even recall the last time I've seen someone use that, the fatman or any grenade launcher. They're extremely not worth using in the current state.
---
It takes some trial and error, but it's great once you get the hang of it. Certain ammo types do well. 5.56 and .45 were always my bestsellers, with shotgun shells right behind those. Components and certain scrap does well, like screws, plastic, and steel. Just gotta see what people need lots of and what's harder to find that you're willing to farm for. :)
---
I have submitted several tickets, wrote on twitter and the forum about this and to atleast make the limit account wide. 
---
And now I dont care about this game anymore lol. So fck it
---
I like two shot myself, but I don't play a min-max character. I'm built for carry weight.
---
I ran it through the damage calculator pre and post nerf and u see what you mean. It’s a heavy hit but it was busted. 600-700 dmg a second tho is still pretty good on TSE but I think it would be good as a backup gun or something
---
More new players are better than some new players.
---
If they improve things, even slowly, it will only increase the reputation of the game and gain new players for them at a higher rate.
---
Hundreds of hours of playtime testing the gauss rifle and correlated with people on the Bethesda forums.
---
Gta they just banned people getting several millions in a certain time lol
---
I think its important this is still a developing situation. And we do probably have a say, just not the final say. And its important to note that.
---
you say the dumbest shit lol. alright, since you are unable to end a conversation yourself I will do it for you. Ive blocked you and will no longer be reading or responding to any of your messages. I just hope for your sake you don’t act like this when you are out in in the real world as opposed to sitting behind anonymity. I assume even though you know I will never read any of your messages your ego will urge you to respond to this. prove me wrong if you want, ill never know. either way this is the end for us. good luck silly stranger, you truly need it.
---
Still waiting on that explanation.
---
FO76 is freaking awesome!!!! i have a few friends who to this day still think i'm crazy for playing it, but they have never given it a shot to which i did cause i love the series. i don't listen to reviewers cause they are only saying what they feel about it, it won't necessarily be what i think of it.
---
started solo back in december but now i'm playing in a couple teams which makes it even more fun
---
those who are complaining about it i believe are just upset that it is not what they envisioned, im not impressed by the whole paying for a private server, but i also understand that it costs a boat load of money to operate so the money has to come to from somewhere. right now i just do the random events that pop up patiently waiting for Wastelanders
---
What is the canvas bag?
---
Fair enough. Thanks for the discussion.
---
It interesting that the caps just enter a void instead og deny the trade, can someone explain the lore behind this? 😄
---
Chances are all the work is focused on Wastelanders by now, and if it is a completely separate development branch from the current public game (like [this older post](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cwmypx/what_wastelanders_will_be/) by /u/Square_Zer0 suggests), then it would be a duplication of effort to port everything back to the "1.x" version. Which was supposed to be dead by now, but the large update has been delayed, so the end result is that it looks as if the game was abandoned. Hopefully it is not, though, the Austin studio has 28 jobs available right now, so they must be working on something.
---
My robot is always silver
---
I’ve always advocated for removing or strongly increasing the cap limit. Cheaters are going to cheat. But punishing the masses for the indiscretions of a few is not the right way to go about it.
---
Ever since the game's been out, yes.
---
And that was the last time Yogi stole your picnic basket
---
With the fast travel bug I’ve always had an enemy nearby but who hasn’t detected me at all.
---
At the fire breathers base for example there is often an enemy upstairs and unless it’s walked to the other side of the building I can’t fast travel unless I kill it.
---
There is no “enemies are nearby” message in these cases though.
---
What’s annoying me is the fast travel countdown timer that pops up.
---
What’s that? Fast travel? Here, wait 30 seconds then don’t go anyway due to the first issue.
---
You can make anything work with bloodied
---
They had some 25% and once 50%. If you need a decent weapon its better to go for two star then paying +50% for the last crap prefix.
---
Cheers!
---
*Todd is coming for you. He knows you play other games besides 76. He will only allow 76. Lock your doors.*
---
cool, just join my private server anytime 
---
we'll take more workshops, but i'll need your help
---
It does not really make a major difference, one can already get extra character slots by creating multiple Bethesda.net accounts and buying the game on each of them, so the "P2W" element is essentially there. The ability to buy more characters on the same account would be mainly for convenience.
---
PSA- as i didnt see anyone else mention this. people can still buy from powered off machines if they travel to your camp. you need to remove the items/vendor or lock them
---
Is there any datamined info if the Advanced and Elite variants will be only for those who stay subscribed consistantly? Or if your subscription expires and you renew it a few days later will it be still available?
---
Damn if were on pc, I’d just give you my aae 10mm pistol
---
I feel the same way when I go to the gas station after midnight looking for beer.
---
I like it.  "Friends are fun" is a good TL:DR of my wall-o-text.
---
Fantastic build ! ! !  
---
Wish you were on PS4.
---
Cheers.
---
Either that or it was the guy's mule himself
---
You're still spinning this back into an individualistic perspective. I'm coming at this collectively. The collective outrage, not your personal.
---
[Xbox One X] my game freezes for a split second when I switch weapons using the d pad. Always. It used to be a lot worse when I played on Xbox one original. I feel like I noticed it get better when I purged my inventory. It’s sad that having items puts such stress on the game. I hope they find a way to improve/fix this.
---
Let me be more clear. Fallout 76 is built on the base laid down by Fallout 4 in the same way that Enderal was built on the base laid out but by Skyrim, with new quests, lore, creatures. Don't continue with this idea that I haven't played F76, I did, and I know what I've seen and felt, there is absolutely no denying its extremely similar to F4. 
---
Have you even played Fallout 4 to see how similar they are? The scorched are ghouls with weapons. Animals are simply imported, mongrels, brahmin, deathclaw. Crafting is like settlement building in F4. New mechanics? Using the benches is extremely similar to Fallout 4. Even the buildings are copies of assets from F4. Little originality exists in F76, expect the multiplayer part. But that was added apparently so they can sell monthly the single player, like the "good" guys they are.
---
Don't get me wrong, I considered that the game brought enough new things to be worth buying, but there is no denying its an asset flip, its just what it is.
---
Why not craft it? (if you have the recipe??)
---
They really slack on adding things for special dates. It’s sad.
---
I suggest hording any 90%reduced weight weapons, for display. Fill the walls with as many guns as your budget will allow. I started on this path with my main, a hvy gunner. I figured if they are going to sit in my stash, why not show off my arsenal. The tri-barrel mini gun with bos paint is my favorite.
---
Last drop? Don't you mean last straw?
---
There are 3 versions of the Ranger Gear in the files. Standard, Advanced and Elite. All of them will have access to the Riot and Desert Paints. No idea how will the Advanced and Elite be implemented tho. The only thing thats sure is they will be Fallout 1st exclusives.
---
I read somewhere that you can't craft normal buffout, only bufftats. But even if it exists, I haven't found it, nor seen it in a player vendor.
---
Yep! You’re right. I was so distraught making this post my math skills ran right out the window.
---
&gt; I could have easily turned them off
---
People can still buy from vendors you've turned off. You have to entirely remove the vendor from your camp or close your vendors off in a room with no doors (and hope a mob doesn't break a wall).
---
That too =)
---
I’ve had this issue and it’s been resolved when I’ve restarted the game. Hopefully that works for you.  
---
If not, I’d probably attempt to make some setting changes.
---
The developer.
---
Yes, true nature of humans, I agree.
---
Didn't even think of that, thank you!
---
You might be right, though I've gotten them and have had them in my vending machine prior to vendoring them.
---
Goddamn lol
---
Figure out what people buy and sell. Best thing to do is legendary farming on the side. I personally like to start at the deathclaw spawn north of the red rocket and head south down the mire, all the way to Tanagra snatching up high levelled enemies and cryptids then I head home where I receive around 10 low level scorch or so that my defences kill anytime someone visits my camp which is often. I end up with a ton of low level weapons to either sell or scrap. I have over 4k steel by farming low level scorch lol.
---
Why did you do that? 😬
---
I'd never say Bethesda doesn't deserve hate, I'm asking if the hate they get is scaled accordingly to their actions in comparison to the rest of the industry. That's a valid question, no?
---
You're probably fast travelling too much lol
---
It’s all good. At the end of the day I’ll just keep grinding hoping to obtain another “god”roll armor or weapon to either use, trade or...after I burn some caps sell.
---
kiss me
---
Ow yeah, they were so expensive, I completely forgot about them! Thx! But I wonder why I can't find any? I used to find them in heaps, they were my main income, along with psycho, and med-x.
---
I just wish I was in your shoes and someone else was letting me know what I found out the hard way haha
---
Nope nothing
---
Thanks that all sounds like a plan but what do mean by moving points from damage to utility? Which SPECIAL poinys should I work on and what is damage and utility?
---
Circumventing RNG to increase you chances by exploiting an unforseen flaw in the server system. 
---
Enjoy.
---
Except you'll be sorry when Bethesda rolls in high cap purchases
---
Yeah, there's seemingly no consistency with which poses support weapons and which don't.  They all *should*.  If I don't want to show my weapon, then I can holster it first.
---
Yes it's normal.  I've killed supermutants and then hear them speak and then hear them cry out as they are killed.  Made me think another stealth sniper was around, only to find out the audio for the enemy was delayed by 2-3 seconds.  Containers take forever to spawn, if you get the endless cycle arrow on a container/enemy forget it.  It timed out and will have nothing to loot.   I've had this happen with legendaries before which is beyond maddening.
---
The terrible decisions the studio makes .
---
In-game text chat would be a pretty good one, yes.
---
It doesn't matter. It still affects the future of the franchise. They are selling Free States merch in the bethesda store. Their changes are here to stay.
---
Free offline mode.
---
Watoga high school
---
I don't even get why there is a max on caps. There is literally no reason and it really screws up guys that want role play as a shop keeper.
---
More endgame things to do.
---
The Watoga High School has a fair amount of aluminum
---
BGS Austin is a developer, Bethesda Softworks is a publisher. Almost literal apples &amp; oranges comparison.
---
It only happens to me when I’m running multiple instance of the game on the same computer.  I assume it’s a memory leak or something like that.  
---
If you have this issue continually I’d first look to make sure your computer meets the minimal specs. Then I’d try to adjust the settings to as low as possible and see if the game runs better on those.
---
What's the flaw though?
---
No legendary effects, or I'd make them craftable/mods. Kill a legendary enemy, find a legendary mod, attach it to your weapon. Maybe it can only be applied to one weapon type.
---
I'm curious though how the decision of a studio who only has 100 something employed ran by an apparent richard vogel affects a place in a different state with different studio teams developing games
---
Add offline single player.
---
I think the trade partner assumed I knew about the limit. After we made the first 25k trade he loaded in his mule for the rest. At that time a lower level person was at my camp as well standing real close to me. He stayed the whole time during both trades and wasn’t moving. I think the trading partner then assumed I gave the lower level guy the 25k caps which is why when I initiated trade with him for the rest of the caps he didn’t question what I was doing.
---
The character name should be displayed, not the account name, or no name at all. Hell we should at least have the option to turn this shit off.
---
It is so utterly symbolic of how little of a shit Bethaustin gave when it comes to the RP and immersion aspects of their game.
---
I hope not, I've been good. I'm not buying anything from a hell vendor.
---
Actually softworks is also a developer zennimax is the publisher
---
Not sure I would say the WS ghouls are unkillable, but it sure seemed like the glowing ones took a lot more dmg from my AAE auto handmade.
---
I don't understand what your point is.
---
We aren't a hive mind though; the collective outrage is an outrage of many individuals positions.
---
Put a silencer on it, get covert operative and use sneak crits you can triple that dps. Your build is more important honestly, figure out how to get the most damage out of your build. Get a good understanding of the cards you need to make damage, what mutations you need. If you get all that right, you should be able to do pretty good with just stock weapons. The gun is the cherry on top of a good build.
---
I imagine that you are trading without bags or big bills so this guy just handed you 50k lose caps and you just kinda drop the rest and forget about em cause i guess why not
---
I, too, would like some AAE weapons. If you’re on PS4, I left them in your inventory by mistake. If you would please return those weapons to me, I greatly appreciate it.
---
He was getting his mule so I guess he didn’t know what was going on. The lower level guy was there when his mule got there
---
Just curious, how to you *accidentally* stow all your weapons on a corpse?
---
Don't ALT-Tab out of your screen while you're loading into the world or fast traveling or else it will cause this.  I get it when I'm running multiple accounts and accidently alt-tab during a load in.  The only way to fix it is to exit back to desktop and start over.
---
Both are good.  I have one of each type of character built.  I personally prefer Rifleman (semi-auto), but both are great.  Just play the one you prefer.
---
Oh I read that wrong
---
Umm... OK... Might I ask what games Bethesda Softworks have developed?
---
Im fine with that, not enough people complain about it and it increases chance of being fixed.
---
Its the brand name that is being affected
---
With all the issues that 76 has, why would a casual gamer pick up Fallout 5 ?
---
BGS has lost a hell of a lot of goodwill with people too
---
Ive never understood why gamers have been so forgiving with Fallout 3 and 4's bugs in the first place.
---
Welcome to the Fallout World where a guy with a board with nails destroys more then the guy launch mini nukes and missiles.
---
I've gotten a number of infinite load screens since the last patch on public servers.
---
There usually a "tell" for this.  If you go to fast travel and it takes an inordinately long time to bring up the load screen, something is going to go wrong.  For me, I have to Alt-Tab and kill the game.  Then, when I relaunch, I have this situation where the main menu music takes a very long time to start, and any attempt to load the game results in a *second* crash that requires an Alt-Tab kill.  It's *only* after that when everything seems to work normally again - almost like the first crash leaves something residual for the next launch.
---
I'm not justifying it. I think Fallout First is overpriced, underbaked and incredibly tone-deaf. It got a lot of hate, moreso than most controversies in the industry. But that's the problem. It wasn't as bad as others but got more backlash. You've got to consider scale.
---
Not wanting to execute someone for illegally parking in a handicap spot isn't the same as thinking they're morally okay for illegally parking in a handicap spot.
---
*Todd would like to know your location*
---
Fallout 3rd- a decent bug free game with loads of content lol 
---
Ok I’ll stop giving them ideas 😂
---
38k down....
---
Apparently only 3 titles directly when I seaced it said Skyrim fo3, and fo4 directly
---
Scam. Even if initial intentions are pure, this will devolve to a scam just due to a lack of repercussions.
---
What reasoning is there to limit the number of caps you can have? I don’t understand. I feel like bethesda is making the stupidest decisions with this game
---
I’m always selling stuff
---
Ok that makes more sense thanks for not being that guy that jumps down someone elses throat
---
Consider your personal contributions to the collective, how you go about thinking of the collective and what legitimacy you lend it.
---
Bethesda isn't even the first studio to own fallout. Other studios can absolutely affect the future of the franchise
---
Wow. OP, you might give some specific reasons why you're quitting and washing your hands of BGS, otherwise your post is mostly meaningless.
---
Workshops are fair game.  If you seek revenge you and your camp is fair game.
---
Rule #1 don’t take workshops if you don’t think you will get killed 
---
Rule #2 never keep junk or mats on your in a workshop zone 
---
Rule #3 never place your camp anywhere near a workshop
---
[deleted]
---
Eh, I'm probably too casual to get the mad loot.
---
This guy reminds me of all the YouTubers that don't play the game and just bash it for attention and views. Lmao
---
I guess it still feels like a reach like comparing prey to prey
---
The ability to reinstance the whole world so you can repeat events and refresh vendor lists (old, but was heavily abused) and gain loot not currently spawned on your own instance.
---
I'd like a fallout home depot for camp building and a fallout chili's that served radrat lol.
---
Morrowind.
---
That's just how they are. They were pretty lackluster in FO4 but they seem to be even less effective in 76.
---
I'll gladly help. I'll be on in about an hour
---
I am not sure how it is a reach when we already have Bethesda itself as an example pf a company changing a franchise permanently
---
yeah i I know. But having the icon not show on the map, and not being able to fast travel directly to the camp can help if your location is off the beaten path. That said i do think they need to change it so a non powered machine does not work nor be able to be interacted with (the camp owner being the exception to that rule.)
---
BethGS Maryland made 76. Austin did the net coding and just supports it long term.
---
For the love of God, let me change the title screen music and background
---
Yeah, no thanks lol. Buying ammo from plauer vendings is expensive. 1 cap per round will rack up FAST
---
or both
---
Everyone has their own way of addressing situations, sometimes it just requires someone whose wording you find palatable.
---
I honestly think its a shame how 76 has turned out (not helped by the atom shop at all, or ingame earnable cosmetics)
---
Im genuinely concerned if there will even be a Fallout 5 in the future, and if it does get made, what will it look like.
---
Im sure that the front line game devs have the games best interests at heart.  But theres an unsustainable greed in the gaming industry atm.
---
Mainly driven by investors, share holders  and upper management that have no clue what actual gamers want, and just want to line their pockets
---
See I was curious who was handling the coding for the game I could never find that out thank you
---
It is a concept, I agree the CU faction would have to be ethical people to work, which may be a big ask, but if we do have a mostly positive community I think a handful of generally trustworthy types could be found.
---
Most of my out of date experience with people in the game was they were generally helpful. The only repercussions is reputation, but that may be enough. Again it probably is not an everyone can join CU faction sort of thing, only the most networked players could have the trust to be the accountants.
---
Last day of beta but I'm on PS4 and a crashed all the time I got bored with it and my only real-life friend that played stopped I was thinking of canceling my PS4 Plus subscription and decided to give it another chance since I never got my money's worth creating a new character about 3 weeks ago I think.  Still crashing every day but it is more fun than it was.  Learning how to avoid bugs by reading here is helpful but I am pretty frustrated I'm still on the fence, I kind of feel that I already pay $60 for the game and $60 to be able to play the game makes me annoyed that they're asking for even more money but I spent my 400 script I had yesterday and got mostly junk turn to that in and got more junk and I spent most of my atoms on the garden Dome package and some emotes in Little Things
---
Suffer. It's just the way it is.
---
Been in game since fo4*
---
That would make it pretty hard for people to report cheating or inappropriate behavior.
---
"Some guy maned Bob has been _____, please ban him."
---
What cha play on,while I don’t have one currently,I’d buy or aquire somehow a cheap three star too donate.
---
The game engine used to build it.
---
They are entitlements -  which basically are how everything in the Atom Shop works. When you purchase something, it actives the entitlement file onto your account which allows you to build whatever it is you unlocked. 
---
They technically can go back to individuals and take away entitlements but there have been very very few reports of it ever happening. Instead, they seem to mass- give or take away entitlements. An example is how all Fallour 1st members lost their status one day, thats because some bug caused the entitlement to turn off.  Or why if you contest something in the Atomic Shop and they refund you, you still keep the item. Or things put int the atomic shop by mistake,  the Deathclaw and Cat chia-pets. Anyone who placed them beforehand, got to keep them. 
---
I think they 100% could take them away, but its too much work to be worth it. 
---
TLDR:  No, it'd be too hard\annoying to take it away once you unlocked a Ranger Outfit.
---
I'm OK with them keeping the perk card system and multi-effect legendaries!
---
I get a guitar. It usually happens after playing nuclear winter but it really does not bother me.
---
Wait 2 star gives better odds per the script?
---
To be honest, it seems like the investors are calling a lot of the shots lately, or at least the company is catering to them.
---
Agreed just want more consistency above all else personally
---
Or they can give fo1st members a safe that can stash 100k Lolol
---
Lmao delete this before they get any ideas 😂
---
Explosive Lever Action....
---
What kind of Legendary is it? Instigating? Furious? Bloodied? Junkies? Something else?
---
That was the best they should make it like that again.

Are you using adrenaline?
---
So I like the idea in theory but I'm not a great financial mind by any stretch of the imagination.... so here are my thoughts. Basically the idea would be to earn interest on your caps deposit right? The problem is that caps aren't really valuable and you (usually) can't use them to buy many of the high tier or rare items from other players.  The other issue is that you can only hold 30k per character so transactions involving more are very tedious.  Right now players hoard legendary items, rare plans, and outfits.  Plans and outfits have the highest weight to value ratio right now.  I have lots of cool rare things that I keep rather than sell for caps because I know I have a better chance at pulling off a trade with an item rather than caps.  A fixer plan is worth about 10k caps right now and weighs virtually nothing, I can hold 10 of them in theory and have 100,000k caps (triple the normal amount you can hold).
---
One thing I had mentioned in other posts was making silver scrap and gold scrap be valued differently.  Make silver 5 caps and gold 10 caps and reducing their weight.  The robot vendors would basically set the price for these items meaning you can always sell 1 silver scrap for 5 caps.  This would allow players to carry a lot more money and be able to pull off some trades.  This also helps to make workshops that have these resources more valuable encouraging organic pvp encounters in adventure mode.

Anyhow that's just my 2 cents.  Like I said I am not great at financial/economics stuff at all so any other thoughts you have on the subject are welcome.
---
Thanks for the interesting read btw. Upvoted!
---
Scam-free trading system.
---
Haha Home Depot actually makes some sense, for that last stupid component you cannot find to complete your luxury camp build. Maybe that could be an investment the CU could fund, trade wholesale commodities to the store at a bulk price to offload material from the CU deposits.
---
Im also trying to do vault raids, so if theres a discord or group that actively raid, hit me up
---
Gt is   SapphyChu
---
That is unlikely to happen, end game is basically finding better legendary gear to be better at ?????
---
2 star give 3 weapons/day. Weapons prefix are main and secondary. On armor however you need to get the 3*
---
Somehow, WoW has managed.
---
It was mentioned a while back that Wastelanders was going to deal with these balance issues.
---
If you want to send it back DM me and I’ll send you a 100% definitely-not-my-own official address ;)

To have something to write about in inside the vault
---
How does the script on Nexusmods for F4 work then?
---
Lucky hole mine has 3-500 lead ore per run
---
thx - I needed the laugh this afternoon!
---
Yeah already switched that to my GPU, also G-sync off gives more FPS for some reason, as well running my monitor on 165hz

You on PC?  I’m always buying .45, .50 and ultracite .308.  Sometimes I need ultracite .45, too.
---
It didn't show only what was in the one active vendor last time I checked
---
I think creating a player hub in Whitesprings would be awesome.  Allow each player to have 1 spot for a vending machine in a common area.  This would allow people to trade, team up, or just socialize with other people.  Allow fast travel to inside the building and make it free for everyone.
---
Only if you can find mods that don't stack onto legendaries to balance it out.
---
Like some sort of Legendary mods section. Call it Scorched Mods or Blight adapors. Or just legendary adapters which makes your gun "adapt" a specific trait.
---
Not true. I kill all in 1 hit with my melee
---
I skip Lucky Hole mine, only because I don't want to have to use extra acid to smelt all of the lead ore. I sell most of my acid in vending machines.
---
I donno about that but The sheepsuatch event got boosted forsure tho.
---
After yesterday everything was extremely laggy on my end. I reset my xbox to clear the cache and nothing really helped. Vending machines took forever to load, etc.
---
Gotta admit, not following your logic here. Could you explain in greater detail?
---
I would not expect Fallout 5 in the next 10 years. Right now, my guess would be Starfield in 2021, TES VI in 2025, then *maybe* Fallout 5 in 2029. And that could even be on the optimistic side, other studios with more manpower than BGS can take 5+ years nowadays between major single player open world AAA releases. Chances are FO76 will either have been significantly improved by then, or long dead and forgotten (with the controversies possibly moved on to the next titles).
---
for a while I had a locked room with a vendor with all low-level legendaries in it, and I would try to get the low levels who visited of my camp to follow me into it and give them the option go through it. But that was a really lot of work and after a while wasn't worth it since the low levels mostly wouldn't follow me into the room
---
Out of curiosity, what was the armor piece?
---
You’re truly missing out by selling your acid. It only takes 1 acid per two ore, super duper can increase your results. I usually can get around 1500-2500 lead scrap from 500 ore/ 250 acid
---
Adrenal reaction mutation, use all the rifleman perks, run tank killer, sneak, covert operative, there is more in forgetting but that’s a start.
---
lucky hole mine.  In excavator, I average 400 lead each time.
---
If you haven't been there or cant fast travel, fighting your way through big bend is the hardest part of getting there.  
---
If you don't want to go there, then paint cans, tin cans, rat poison, wooden blocks, some toys...the weight room at Charleston FD (found about 300# last time I was there)...
---
Are you serious? It's only true if it happened to you? Haha you must be on some crazy shit man
---
Because as empty as fallout 3 was, It was still way more fun than 76 in my opinion, the DLC's really made fallout 3 good, other than that it was empty,
---
Fallout 76 has had a non-stop taste of bugs and problems, there has never been a dull moment when you see a scorched dude coming at you sliding on the ground stretched out like a star 🤣👌
---
...or, and this is just a theory, they are doing surprisingly well considering that it was a studio that was bought by Bethesda, given an engine they had never worked with before, told to make a multiplayer game in that single player engine, try to stick to the lore of a game franchise they had never worked in before and then being told by Zenimax to release it long, long before it was ready.
---
To be honest, I think the Devs here are surprisingly successful.
---
Zenimax on the other hand can go fuck themselves with a cactus.
---
Both. I've leveled 5 times on my overseer rank since yesterday and I am a decidedly not good NW player LOL I'm gunning for that Outcast PA paint at level 60 by the end of the weekend
---
Dope!!
---
Alright,lemme do some server hoppin &amp; see what I can come up wit,anyone got a doody 3star on the cheap,lemme know.
---
Sorry, I meant I added one over my lunch hour so 5 total now
---
No perk card blue prints
---
I new spot I found (level 205 btw. lol) was the prison yard at the State Pen.  There are quite a few weights out there and right next to it is a shed with a workbench.  
---
The other ones I used before are the weight rooms in the nuke silo's.  Easy to access and tons of weights.
---
Hornwright manor has a weight room inside.
---
Charleston FD
---
Motel in Flatwoods.
---
You can also go to the Lucky hole.  Pretty easy.
---
Lmfao
---
two shot is more like quarter shot since it only does a second shot for 25% damage
---
Yes, it is insanely counter intuitive.  In any other game the rocket launcher would be the obvious choice against giant flying enemies but here it is total garbage.
---
It sometimes spawns a lot of enemies still.
---
Other times each “wave” has 1 enemy.
---
They need to cut the chance for the spawn rate to be that low in my opinion.
---
Same thing happens on uranium fever with the molemen.
---
ThEy ArE hUrTiNg ThE rEaL pLaYeRs

Same thing if you sell stuff to the vendor bots and you're already at 30k.

---
Sale on souls in limbo on me
---
Wait, why would anyone pay for excavator armor? It's literally free ingame.
---
could i have it? :P
---
I ultimately don't understand what this discussion is supposed to lead to. Many people are angry at bethesda. You've pointed out that there are many examples of other companies behaving as badly or worse and that the industry is itself toxic. I've pointed out that those actions by others don't diminish bethesda's ill action because we all still individually have a relationship with bethesda. You've told me that I'm thinking too individualistically and to think about my contribution to the collective. 
---
My contribution to the collective is the same as many others, that bethesda is falling into the very toxic industry practices that you've described and that I don't approve of that. I'm not going to reconsider that position because over whataboutism.
---
Not saying it dose not happen to you. I'm just saying i have not once left anything with any hp after i hit it. Not every hit counts. I've hit thing 3or4 times be4 it registers once it dose they always have no health...relax guy
---
Haha the bots downvoting because you typed fuck
---
I really hope Bethesda updates PvP in the future. It seems that the spirit of workshop PvP is fighting over resources. I want what you have, we can't negotiate an agreement, so I'm going to fight you for the workshop. Instead we get people who see workshops as a PvP arena and don't want anything from the workshop itself. 
---
I don't think PvP is a bad idea. Fighting against other players should be much more challenging--and rewarding--than fighting AI. There is a place for it in this game, but we can all agree that the situation in its current form is far from ideal.
---
Hopefully you and your BIL keep playing on public servers. There are definitely pros and cons to both, but the game won't be the same if everyone's hiding out in their own worlds.
---
The cap limit man, 30k is so weak.
---
I'm at work right now but I know its Explosive, Has 15% Faster Reloading, and Medic to heal team? Its a 3\*
---
I would sell it back quarter price lmao
---
I stopped selling starter legendaries because of this.  I’d put good one and two star equipment in my machine for 76 caps, stuff like a single star bloody Gauss or an executioners/swing speed pick axe.  Things I don’t use and can’t trade, but are still good weapons for players without top end gear.  Everyone past lvl 10 can afford 76 caps.  
---
After the third time that a high level player cleared out everything I was selling, undoubtedly to throw away as scrip or resell for four figures, I stopped doing it.  I’d rather just have the 5-15 scrip and spend it on myself.
---
The same thing happens with ammo. If I try to be helpful and clear out every unused type for 0 caps, one player will come along and take everything.
---
Each silo has a weight room.  Flat woods, as well as Morgantown.  I advise just hitting them up every 24 or so hours.  Public side, you may struggle to find them but it’s possible with hopping.  
---
Private side, it’s quite nice for collecting lead.
---
If you don’t want to smelt, a reliable spot for scrap lead is gyms in the silos. Much less likely to already be scavenged than the prison, motel, or fire station gyms. 
---
Depending on how much you need how fast, it might just be worth it to look in other folks’ vending machines, though.
---
Those weights in the yard were something many of us complained to Bethesda about for months. At launch, they were static objects in the world that couldn't be looted. 
---
The silos are probably the most commonly overlooked. You can get about 80 lead scrap worth of weights per silo and it's right at the entrance so it's easy to loot. There's also rat poison and cans if you look around a bit.
---
I was not on, i have some good 10mm pistols you can have if you want.
---
I've tried chasing newbies down to offer them free stuff, but they're apparantly scared of high level players, like we can kill them or something.
---
Should i wear clothes?
---
I’d b down

The point is to get people thinking on a wider context that's easy to overlook. I *hope* that'll help inspire a more productive use of internet outrage, but the point is just to get some people to shift perspectives.
---
You win...

400? I must be missing something I almost always walk out with 259.

I like this idea.  It might even encourage players to interact with each other in a civilized manner.

---
whats exectly what i wanted to write! I just hate the legendary system
---
As long as they create a brand new engine for it, instead of re-using the current one, ill be fairly happy 😂
---
I might be down to help
---
Not if they have no money because Activision fired them.
---
I once was given a vampires two shot fat man by a random person at the whitespring
---
Yes, same here. Anyone else not being able to use emotes? The emotes wheel is just blank for me...
---
It doesn't matter if you have every single perk and points unspent... that's not how legendary perks are going to work.
---
Negative, I think we are just done. If that didn't do it we are not even playing the game really.
---
Bad ass!
---
Add me on PC if you want the interior walls with wall papers!
---
At least I think I can use them in others camps, right?
---
WoW user names are unique on each server, and servers are static, so it's trivial to track down the account of a wow player based on their character name.
---
Or not even a scam. Sometimes people just quit playing. Imagine having a bunch of caps stored on some other person who disappears one day.
---
Ill do some raids. Im fairly experienced with this raid as well. Ill be on in about 10 mins if your still looking for another body.
---
Your not going to pump it up any from perks, you've got all that will affect your damage.
---
Are you bloodied? If you want crazy high numbers you'll need chem and food buffs too
---
You're not wrong about the industry. People should be outraged about it. But I think their experience with fallout 76 can be a more immediate stepping stone to that larger issue--a more personal experience of a larger problem.
---
Make it free to play, giving back people who bought it a free sub of F1st up to the max of 6 months for those that bought the power armor set. That would make the sting of being F1st'ed a little less painful
---
“Tragedy of the commons never changes...”
---
The game is like Maxwell House... Good to the last drop!!
---
I'm that guy. I needed scrap and i am really lazy. Other things I like:
---
\- one shotting legendaries during events before anyone else can tag them, hell one shotting everything so no one else gains experience. I love ignoring other players protesting.
---
\- Running down the clock as fast as possible in One Violent Night and Scorched Earth (quick SBQ kill, cuz i can). This way there are very few spawns so little chance of additional legendaries. And often players arrive after the Queen is dead and give me that cool frowny face. 
---
\- Nuking the prime fissure in such a way that either you are forced to fight in the blast zone (no silly costumes or legendary armor suckers!) or so that the dsv9 bunker at least is in the blastzone so no where to retreat to and regroup!
---
\-Ambushing players who are setting up workshops cuz there is nothing more satisfying than just executing someone minding their own business. 
---
Thankfully there is no kick button in this game. That's why i'm here.
---
I'm kidding of course. I am not that guy, but I HAVE MET HIM.
---
Now they'll add it to the store for 1500 atoms, thank you
---
Right up daddy's treasure cove!
---
I have hundreds of hours in both. The games are both fallout sure, and just because some structures look the same and they didn’t waste resources redesigning enemies doesn’t make it an “asset flip”. You are misusing that terms.
---
If you say so.
---
But I'm doing fine without it.
---
Right... and almost every other online RPG. Sometimes I don't know where some of these people have been for the last 20 years of online gaming. This is absolutely not a new problem
---
Unfortunately the missile launcher, grenade launcher, and fatman are very underpowered.  In addition to that, they suffer from a lot of other drawbacks:
---
Pros:
---
* Decent AOE damage for groups of enemies.
---
Cons:
---
* Ammo is heavy, rare, and expensive to craft. 
---
* The weapons themselves also weigh a lot.
---
* Weapon durability is so low that you can barely use them before they break (this is with 200% durability + gunsmith).  I can't even imagine trying to use these without the durability perks.
---
* Single target damage is garbage.  Most enemies take numerous shots to kill, making you waste what little ammo you have.
---
* The enemy you would most want to use these weapons against (scorchbeasts, mirelurk queens, deathclaws, etc) all have extreme explosive resistance, rendering them even MORE useless!  These enemies are basically tanks, what do you use to kill tanks?  That's right, big fucking explosives.  The game design here is entirely backwards.
---
I still stockpile ammo for these weapons (and use them occasionally) in the hopes they get buffed.  Currently they are so worthless people will give you the ammo (despite being rare/expensive to craft) for free.  I have 200+ missiles, 50+ mini nukes, and 500+ 20mm grenades without having to craft any because most vendors sell them for 1 cap or people just give them away because they weigh so much.  That is really the only upside to using these weapons at the moment.
---
I am bloodied pretty sure.
---
Medics prefix is part of your problem, I would go for Instigating/Bloodied/Junkies/Furious.
---
Does it matter? You still right click the name and report it. Bethesda can code it to report the exact account on their end without revealing that info to players.
---
Got my camp on a lead mode with extractor. Lead for days
---
I’d say if they are going to get fixed it will be with wastelanders. If they are not fixed with wastelanders I wouldn’t hold my breath on it happening anytime soon after that.
---
Ya responsibility for the accounts needs to be shared by the entire faction, so if one member is lost (hit by a bus) it does not matter since your caps are not stored to a particular person. This gets harder if CU is storing rare items as those may obviously be irreplaceable if lost.
---
Have to link this to the official boards. Awesome job!
---
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/mobilebasic
---
Short answer, ore, can chimes, lifting weights, pain cans (not empty ones).  The list above has locations for those and any other resource you might want.
---
I think it's highly debatable. They typically add as many if not more things than they take away. That being said, "streamlining" isn't an inherently bad thing. Most modern AAA rpgs are what you would called streamlined in comparison to classic older titles. I mean cyberpunk looks mainstream af but that doesn't stop it from also looking like a great game. Also, the alleged "dumbing down" started with oblivion so we really need to stop throwing skyrim under the bus. It's a great game and a good rpg either way. But honestly I don't really want to get in a big arguement about all that
---
Let's try it. Give me your login information.
---
8700k,GTX 1070.
---
I can usually hold around 80-90fps at whitesprings no problem in 1080p.
---
Fullscreen instead of windowed makes a huge difference IMO.
---
Buggy though.
---
Can drop to 720p when alt tabbing, never found a cure apart from restarting the game.
---
Never tried to click on a player's name in 76, is that a thing?
---
It's because you want to get a bloodied lever. More starts better but even a 1 start bloodied is killer. Only change I'd say is drop is psychopath for 4 leaf clover or tormentor in luck. And maybe swap action boy for gunfu in agility. Gunfu auto snaps to targets in vats after a kill and is amazing. 4 leaf gives more crits and tormentor does cripple limbs with rifles.
---
Items that will sell..
---
1) 5.56 ammo at 1 cap.
---
2) Serums at 250-300 per.
---
3) non-perishable food (2-5 caps per)
---
4) plastic (3-4 per), ballistic fiber (20-25 per), screws (5-7 per)
---
Those are the items I struggle to stock.  I make 7-15k a day selling serums at 250 per.  (2-3 hours logged in).  
---
Making caps is not hard if you recycle caps into serum plans.  It may take you a week or two max to stock them all after sales pickup.  Then it’s just persistent stocking and being welcoming and thankful over voice when customers shop.  I have tons of repeat shoppers.
---
It would however render their online reporting system useless, meaning the only way to put in a report is through the game.
---
I think there are better ways to do that, other than literally deleting monies. The real world economy allows some people to have obscene wealth, despite massive inflation. I want realistic capitalism, lol.
---
As a gun dealer in the game, I've been trying to help my customers understand that it is more important to take the weapons total damage per second (DPS) in account over damage per round.  For instance, a workshop standard good ol' level 50 Lever Action with no perks considered at all will dish out 75 damage per round and with only .50 hits per second due to its low fire rate, that weapon will only yield 37.50 of total damage per second.  Now take a workshop Handmade at level 50 with no perks considered and it only dishes our 45 damage per second.  But since it can do it at 4 hits per second, its total damage per second is a whopping 180 over the Lever Action's 45 DPS.
---
Before the famous nerfs earlier this year, damage per round held a lot of respect in the game, but now it's how much damage you can sling out each second that counts.  Hope this helps.
---
The suggestion in the feature was that as part of having a scrap all button, non-legendary items can be flagged to be ignored.
---
This is Todd's way of saying start using a better main gun.
---
&gt;We listened to your feedback on the 30k cap limit and per character limits. To combat exploits, the 30k caps limit will now be linked to your account, rather than each character.
---
Hey there
---
Hate when a minor slip ruins a build and gameplay.
---
Don’t have an AA 10mm, but I have an AA VATS damage revolver 15% reload, some Instigating revolvers, Two-Shot pistols and Junkies pistols in my stash.  You are welcome to pick whatever is suitable for your build (all are 3*)
---
how are you guys dealing with the healing problem shotguns have, i tried going for a shotgun build a while back but it was useless as it seemed a low level pipe pistol would do more damage.
---
Maybe with a bunch of mods? Scratching my head too.
---
Probably, or people just assumed i was being an asshole cus they dont know that i know ferg
---
You run at low health?
---
where is that in the original post? All I see is this:
---
&gt;Title: The scrap menu should have an option "Scrap all non-legendary weapons" and "Scrap all non-legendary armor".  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Text: Excluding outfits of course but, I can't tell you how annoying it is to have to hit the space bar 30 times to break down everything I get from looting npcs.
---
Not sure what there was to read on this that was missed. Mainly I don't see where you said there should be a configurable flag.
---
I was absolutely getting slideshow lag with 3-4s freezes at its worst on my private servers when I subbed last week. It wasn't all the time though (worst was in Morgantown), so not sure if it's the same problem. I'm also on PC.
---
&gt; Excluding outfits
---
Implicit suggestion of a way of flagging it.
---
Not new but they have a live bomb strapped to their backs.  Mole miners use a lot of shotguns and missle launchers.  I think you can do the math.  Friendly fire is a hell of a thing ;)
---
Unless it's both. And when they drop, I poop my pants, becausd I am sneaking every where.
---
If you type market and 76 after an r and a slash you'll find the place.
---
OK... well that's debatable. I guess when you wrote:
---
&gt; Can the respondents to this post not read?
---
You meant you are curious why people can't read your words and understand them like you?
---
I agree with your suggestion, but I didn't 'read' that in your original message. You only mentioned outfits.
---
It's a good suggestion though. I would have just upvoted it had it been a bit more clear.
---
Well fallout 1st didn't exist when NW launched. I expect they're parceling out exclusive wastlanders content to the bourgeois and figuring out the bare minimum they can give everyone else.
---
Love seeing these "floating" builds.
---
Yup.  There are a couple of passageways which are mostly hidden by vegetation, thus are easy to miss.  IIRC, there's a few deposits in the carts, too.  
---
There's also a bit over 200 crystal.   Last couple time through, the  enemies were mole miners, so bonus steel and black titanium.  Hat cave crickets once; acid :)

This is just the plans to craft your PA at .
---
This is good info thank you

Save you caps and complete the excavator quest; you get the plan when you complete the quest.
---
Good info in general.  Thanks all.
---
Since my camp is based in the Cranberry Bog I usually seek out low level players, gift emote by them for their attention, and then drop food, legendary weapons/armor, stimpaks, junk, radaway, and purified waters I don't need/want. I'll even just leave stuff in their camp if they're not around.
---
I just don't generally trust high level players ever since my first nuke experience a group of 200 leveled players would purposely walk in front of people to get accidentally shot so they could kill low levels for caps and junk.
---
perhaps a more entertaining question would be who here read the Dark Tower when it was a first edition? :)
---
I don’t miss the old event because the canned meat stew used to expire.
---
I always skip the crystal. What’s it used for and does it need to be processed or ready as is?
---
Spring 2020
---
I never got my first one!
---
I know. I was about to do that but i remembered that i crafted the armor and gave it to my friend but a while after that his hardrive broke and he doesn't want to reinstall the game. So i have to craft the armor again wich is gonna take forever for me so i just want to know if this is legit or just a glitch.
---
Like Erickson's helmet from Far Harbor
---
raw crystal needs to be smelted.
---
Its used for some weapons and armor.   And to make film for the prosnap deluxe camera.
---
Does it have +250 damage resistance while reloading?
---
The pushed it back until next year. Hopefully it will have a smoother rollout since they have more time to test it.
---
My thoughts exactly!
---
Answer: yes it is
---
Are u on xbox? I can give u a way to get it back. it's just gonna take some work.. I make marsupial serum and sell it at vendors for 400caps I think .. but it wont take long. I'm on my second 25k as I pick up everything and sell what I dont need.
---
The price will depend on your charisma. I normally run with charisma 5 and the power armour station plans are 1100 for me. However if I raised it with beer, grape mentats etc the price would lower. So I'm guessing your charisma is a bit higher than 5?
---
Yep it's 6. So are you saying i can actually just buy the plans instead of doing the mission?
---
Yes if they are full auto. If not then they use rifleman
---
Little things like this are just a constant reminder to me that Devs need to stop with the 'half assed' MMO RPGs.
---
Either go for it, or don't. Don't pull out into the lane then nervously stop. You're gonna get hit...
---
Have you heard of the game Factorio or ever played it?  If so, programming is a lot like that.  You start out with a small base, but as you expand more and more and more your old designs start to become limiting and get in the way of progress.  
---
It seemed like a good idea at the time to put your smelting area over here but now you can't expand it because your fucking steam turbines are in the way.  You can't just move them because the coal patch is right there and the only other water source is really far away so it'd be a huge pain.  Also you just noticed your conveyor belts aren't moving items fast enough to feed all the smelters anymore so you need to divert to a second line of them.  What the hell, why are the lights flickering?  Oh shit I don't have enough steam turbines to power everything, but the damn smelters are in the way and I don't have room for more turbines!  Fuck the bugs are attacking the southern entrance and the turrets just ran out of ammo, I can't deal with these other problems right now I need to go kill those damn things.  Okay, I killed the bugs, but why aren't my trains running anymore?  Damn it they ran out of coal, why the hell... oh shit my coal patch ran dry! 
---
If you don't know what I'm talking about, basically at the start you are solving seemingly simple problems but the larger your factory gets the more your old solutions start to turn into new problems.  Of course part of the fun is learning from this experience and planning things out ahead of time rather than designing your factory on the fly (which is how we solve this problem in programming as well!), but a common phrase is that no plan survives contact with the enemy (which are end-users in the programming case).
---
Vending. I farm legendary weapons and armor, plans and mods and sell them. I rarely use my 1400 daily cap limit as I dont even need it. I have a nice shop built to look like a pub and usually have it set up near Whitespring. Lots of traffic and sales. 
---
Good places to farm:
---
Start at the pumpkin house, head south on the road. Youll have three shots at a legendary enemy from there to Sons of Dane compound. 
---
Atlas Observatory. Hit and miss but sometimes you;ll get three legendary enemies there. Other times, none. 
---
West Tek - well known farming spot. 
---
RobCo - also well known farming spot. 
---
Theres a small lake by the Ranger Station in Cranberry Bog - no legendaries there but the pond will have one sometimes. 
---
Overgrown Sundew Grove - good spot for a legendary enemy. 
---
Dyer Chemical - maybe one, maybe two, maybe none. Depends. Usually an Annihilator Sentry bot though. Be ready for that dude. 
---
I also do a lot of events and ALWAYS head for the SBQ when someone nukes it. I also nuke it a couple few times per week.
---
Realistically, everything that happens in 76 effects all Bethesda games going forward in terms of monetization practices.  And can even have a broader effect for other games in general.
---
I've made some long time fallout friends teaming with random people in Whitespring nukes. Been playing for 7+ months with a few of them at this point. It has definitely kept the game alive for me.
---
I would **kill** to have an M1 Garand (or even the Service Rifle/All-American from New Vegas)
---
What armor is worth 50k?  Just wondering.
---
It was never 20k. It started at 25k during BETA and went to 30k a few months ago.
---
Yes you can. You will still get the plans when you do the mission, but you can always sell them on.
---
Thank you. You just saved me a whole lot of time and effort. I appreciate it.
---
5k, give or take.
---
When I got a two shot missile launcher I was filled with joy. I then found a plan for a targeting computer in a miner key quest. I was so ready to have a two shot, tracking missile launcher build which i thought would be great for the Queen. I then found a scorchbeast flying overhead, I locked on, fired, watched the two missiles chase it down, and then was filled with utter disappointment. It did ~5% of damage to it. 
---
With the weight of missiles, how fast it degrades, and the damage output, it just didnt feel worth it. So I threw it into my vendor and i guess other players want nothing to do with it either. Kind of sucks that missile launchers murder my health but can barely hurt many creatures in the wasteland.
---
I don't typically care what other outlets think.  However, for the game to be successful,  they have to improve the game AND their reputation.  Let's just hope Wastelanders achieves that.
---
Wastelander's was delayed and it's obviously their focus for good reasons that have been discussed so much.
---
I can't help but feel that in light of that controversial-but-likely-wise move - they should have taken a few days to regroup &amp; throw together a small-yet-consistent interim content strategy. It would have avoided these types of posts and that Kotaku article I've seen floating around.
---
A few days off for a staff 'Game Jam' - *when you've got a now open-ended 2020 release* \- wouldn't have been the end of the world imho and might even pay for itself if done with tact.
---
EG: A few 'vault-tec' logos with Year One! slapped on those models with easy-to-edit diffuse textures would make it real easy to shut everyone up and begin earning that good kind of PR again.
---
2XP IS better then nothing and there's probably good salient reasons for everything else.
---
 I just hope they don't bank too much on 2020 and hang themselves with the seemingly ever-growing Wastelander's expectations. A bit of low-effort content *(CAMP, Apparel, etc)* now would go a long way to relieving pressure / overhype down the road IMHO.
---
Refine the perk card system
---
Maybe they need to learn some armor and weapon mods still?
---
The Penitentiary ALSO has multiple Can Chimes (9 cans each) inside, in the trailers in the courtyard, and the back "hole" in the main wall (north side). Also pick up combination wrenches...   
---
Top of the World/Cabins has 9 sets of chimes as well as a few stray lead weights outside the lodge.
---
If so, only reloading while crouched seems to fix this.
---
While I love FO76 and FO4 and believe they're great games in spite of their many issues, I do wonder how great those games could truly be if they were made by a different developer, like Rock Star with RDR2 and GTAV.
---
I keep the ridiculously common plans like the  MMG and buzzblade plans in my machines for zero caps.  This is normally just fine and people only take one.  Every once in a while someone will come in and take them all then run back to their CAMP to post them for some ludicris sum.  500+ caps usually.  I just laugh.  I was giving those away for free because they are so plentiful but please, by all means, look stupid and greedy overpricing them.  I will just pick up more the next time uranium fever kicks off.
---
I'm confused.  Crafting / giving away PA parts does not affect your PA station.  
---
As long as you have completed the excavator quest, you should already have the PA station plan in your inventory - all you need to do is go to your camp, enter build mode, and place the PA station.  ( I think its under workbenches).  
---
Did you mean in the vendors inventory list, reads "Plan : power armor station" instead of  "(Known) Plan: Power armor station"  ?
---
If that's the case, then yes, I've seen that before with some mod plans - if the PA station shows up when you are in build mode in your camp, then I'd call it a bug.
---
UGL are good weapons and economical -  prime UGLs use Ultracite fusion cores.
---
I use a bloodied UGL at scorched earth. Better than going through a couple of thousand rounds of ballistic ammo.
---
Who said anything about YouTube? I'm talking about professional game reviewed have rated TOW at 96% and fo76 rated 7%. Lol
---
What's the best mods for being economical? I've never used the lasers before
---
This is freakin’ awesome
---
No, i probably just made it sound confusing. What i meant is that i didn't complete the mission and it doesn't say "(known)". I don't have the plans and was wondering if i was high or if i actually could buy it from the vendor.
---
Latershater
---
I agree - but first I'd love a 'quick pose' function where you can favourite a pose and instantly activate it without going into photodiode and then going through ALL of them to find the one you want.

All AP reduction values (-25% AP Cost included) stack multiplicatively, so you will get diminishing returns the more you stack. However, it's still worth it to stack as much as possible. 
---
In the case of the Combat Rifle, getting all AP Reduction mods along with the Legendary Effect will cause each shot to only cost 6 AP from its original cost of 25 AP/ shot. Even without the legendary effect, you're looking at 9 AP/shot.
---
Shotgun with enforcer equiped, shoot them in the wing and make them land.
---
well GTA is handled by an experienced team as well as a much bigger team. it is like comparing apples to a car
---
Gatling gun works well, cheap ammo and decent damage
---
&gt;apparently that also stacks indefinitely :P
---
I'm no doctor but that could just maybe it lol
---
I wouldn't complain.
---
I’d usually only recommend using the Level 1 weapon damage cards. Wasting 9 points for 60% compared to 3 points for 30% is a pretty big waste of points, especially if you run a more “general” type build or use different weapons other than rifles. I used to run 3 points for 30% but decided that since I’m in such the late game and don’t have to really worry about support or utility perks anymore, I’d use some of the points so saved up and fully dedicate myself to 9 points for 60%. 
---
Was it worth it ? Like I said, I’m level 192 and have everything in the game I could want until Wastelanders come out, so I don’t have to worry about perks that others might find really helpful especially on the early to mid game. My damage output is also pretty crazy now, with stealth I can 1 tap headshot everything short of a Yaoguai and just melt everything with a steady stream of bullets. Also if you’re into PvP (I’m not) then getting the edge on every bit of damage you can get is crucial.
---
This would be really nice

Since you can't make buff out, I would look into a different addiction. Mentats are great, easy to make and pretty prevalent. Makes staying high easier.
---
Kinda sad your getting down votes for having a opinion. Way to meany people on this sub downvote for no reason
---
That first pic is super!! All the details at different focal lengths give it an action feel.
---
Aw geeze guys, thanks for all those nice responses! Glad to hear you guys enjoy is as much as I do :D
---
Not it gonna lie, had me in the first half
---
Works well. Now you don’t need to play as much Fallout 76.
---
The Two shot auto launcher does more damage than the Bloodied however. Just a random thing.
---
Thanks for the offer, but atomic shop content can only be placed in your own camp :P
---
Cheers mate! Glad you like it :D
---
Now if only they would add those cannons from the Phillippi Battle Cemetery to the atomic shop as camp items P:
---
It is apparently possible to get it to zero with a reduced VATS legendary. I haven't done this myself since I don't have a gun with that effect but I've seen several posts about it. It seems like there's probably some weird rounding errors involved because when I calculated it, it seemed like you should only be able to reduce it to around 7 AP per shot.
---
I've also heard it doesn't work with all weapons since some have super high AP costs. I've heard it's possible with combat rifles, assault rifles, handmades, and 10mm pistols.
---
(A lot of heards and seems in there, I know. Take it for what you will.)
---
Yeah, but this one's pure fantasy.
---
More quests
---
You guys remember when named weapons were good? Lincolns repeater rifle members. It's there in the capital Wasteland. Ready for the taking.
---
Fair point. It is indeed
---
Do not need login information, the trust is when you give another player caps/stuff that you get it back. Unfortunately identifying trustworthy players may not be all that easy so I assume the CU faction members will be rare.
---
Damn..thanks brother
---
Bloodied explosive railway rifle has a high damage output even without riflemen perk cards i use it for my melee character
---
Dupper!
---
Lol stunt
---
I like this idea very much.
---
Ultracite fusion cores are cheaper to make atm than before. There are some perk cards ( or card ) that increase the amount of rounds per core ( can't think which one at the moment but still reasonable without it ).
---
I only need 3 Ultracite fusion cores for a Scorched Earth event and that's taking out the Queen and heaps of scorched.
---
If targeting the SBQ I always stop just before it's health disappears because there is a chance you may vaporize it with a laser etc. Switch to a handmade for the cleanup.
---
hot
---
I guess does anyone know of a player they would trust in their platform to act as a Credit Union or is no one capable of being trusted?
---
Also I could consider a small scale version of this, not so useful for big legendary trades, but if only small values are at risk maybe it is more tenable.
---
So I lost 2 explosive handmades and a bloodied ffr laser rifle to this... because I was too impatient. Since then, I only drop items Im okay with losing.
---
I dropped 60 stimpaks and they just vanished, Bethesda gives zero fucks about your items man sorry to say
---
Yeah he's a good dude. Do you remember the arguments we had about it? Kinda felt like we were both Patrick in the explanation meme
---
Are you chasing them down in power armor? That's pretty scary tbh
---
Kill a legendary at a fissure site works
---
Maybe it’s an auto correct. Just playing devil’s advocate here...
---
Yes, they're both rifles. So any rifle cards, some also depend on semi or full auto like Commando, Ground Pounder (although the reload speed works for semi auto as well) and Rifleman
---
I just a bloodied 50cal. Not super effective but it’s fun and the armor piercing perk card is in intelligence which I had space for a card while set up for combat.
---
I did something similar with all of my duplicate plans I had. Sure, I wanted to get rid of them by setting them at 0, but wasn't expecting one high level player to come buy and just take all of them. Since that, I put a low price on most everything to just discourage that sort of behavior(and make a cap in the meanwhile).
---
Lol. Everything about this game is fucking ass
---
So nowhere in this post OP states they even played the game. Ok then.
---
I don’t think they have played it.
---
Purgatory.... LMAO, best description of the pigging game I've ever heard. Fitting, hmm.
---
Like dinner tables, periodic tables or table of contents?
---
Oh wow, I guess the Great Canvas Shortage of 2018 has been resolved!
---
Seems to be fixed now but I had switched to heavy guns for awhile while it was happening
---
heard\*
---
Actually no, it doesnt fix it if it's already broken. Reloading when crouched keeps it from breaking but once it breaks you can only fix it by quick swapping to another gun and back. Also you can keep the +250 DR if you stay crouched after you reload and it will stay as long as you are crouched and use the gun. 
---
I have done extensive testing on this and made a few posts to different places covering it along with a youtube video.
---
Haha.  I have that same glitch in Skyrim but with dragons instead of scorchbeasts.  Gotta love when glitches I've been dealing with years in Skyrim show up in FO76.
---
Man that's pretty awesome. Gj.
---
Mainly the tables that are apart of the environment. It’s annoying to see floating objects when in reality it’a invisible tables.
---
I know. Just pissed at myself for dropping it. Lol
---
yes, cant even be bothered to explain the several strange things occurring since tuesday, its clearly not worth beths time to fix, not worth my time to write it up

Sure the player base is getting banned for reporting bugs

Check this out and to the OP if your gun has it please view as well. The gun is not useless but has a quirk and can be really really powerful if you understand how to control the effect.
---
It's called the T20 Prototype Rifle. It was apart of a project to consolidate the infantry weapons of the time. They developed it wanting to combine the M1 Garand and the BAR kinda like how they converted M1 Carbines into M2 Carbines to replace the SMGs of the time.  (Which never came to fruition). Ultimately it lead to the development of the M14 rifle which was adopted in 1959.
---
It's really bizarre. For reasons I can't fully explain, bashing Bethesda has become  almost like a second job or something.  I saw the same thing with Fallout 4. 
---
Hey I fully understand loving a  video game franchise and suddenly the next entry is disappointing. It has happened to me (won't say which franchise because that would start a flame war and derail the thread).
---
But when that has happened to me, I just forget about it and find other games to play.  It's like that with most people and most games.   
---
But with Fallout (and Bethesda in general), people literally spend YEARS putting out youtube videos and Reddit posts talking about terrible  the game is.
---
I mean, people are free to express themselves but man it's just really bizarre to me.
---
Is this what the sub is up to now? Ship camps?
---
yup
---
They were reclaimed? Who would do this?!
---
Yup this dude hasn't played the game since launch obviously.  T-Pose bug hasn't shown up for months now.  Go back to watching shitty fraudulent clickbait YouTube videos, Liberator NPC
---
This game is way way way better when playing with others. I was strictly a solo player in this and every other game for a long time, but I actually made my first friend at Whitespring during the aftermath of my first solo nuke launch at level 55. That friend turned into 2 and then 4 and now I've got a wide group of about 25 people I play with somewhat and 8-10 people that I'm very close to. I'm now level 350 and playing with others has been a gamechanger. Don't get me wrong--there are still times when I just want to go off and do my own thing, so I just tell my friends that and they understand. Fallout brought me into this game. Making friends has made me stay for 1500 hours.
---
itll launch along first fallout 2nd, for a daily price of 5$
---
I am on PS4 also. I have noticed this problem however I have learned to work around it. Since you get the same addiction whether you use buffout or bufftats, make bufftats. Equip the chemist perk and super duper. You'll get more than 2x as much bufftats. I have found that if you find a buffout in the wild (not in a chem container, just like sitting on a desk or something) it always spawns in the same location every refresh. Theres one in the shower area of the golf course for example.
---
Hell I just wasted 3k the other day because the wife and I got our trade backwards and I gave her caps when she was full instead of receiving.
---
That’s a good video. Yea +250 is actually pretty freaking game changing if utilized!
---
Purge the Reddits of people that don't actually play the game.
---
This! Bethesda you listening.....
---
They don't let you see the other persons caps during a trade. Just more great QOL features from the dev's.
---
Yes it is. Especially for sneak builds. The player is typically crouched anyways so it just adds survivability. I know I didnt get the +250 staying on video but I dont really want it patched haha cuz it's a hidden gem. It's easy enough to check too. Before reloading look at the pip boy numbers crouch, reload, then check again, sneak around and look again and notice it stays.
---
I've joined adventure, and bought a bunch of buffout from a player vendor, I made it my mission to find them, but after a total of about 13h and not finding a single buffout, I gave up. I'm Allready addicted to mentats, psycho, alcohol, and now also to buffout. Any ideas where I can find daytripper consistently? It's the last one that doesn't drain anything important for my build.
---
This would be a really good way to implement my idea for a egg nog recipie.

Gonna call it all and ask who read the entire story telepathically when it was but a passing thought through the mind of the author when he was high on mescaline and painkillers?

I've played a little bit early after release with some friends but they've all moved on from the game. Met a few dozen people in game that I keep in touch with still.  Definitely going to team up with random people going forward. Thank you for your reply, glad to see others having positive experiences in game.
---
Only if you are comparing it to the free to play week. After that, it seems like it's the same 100-150 regular core group of people ever since inception but maybe a few new players every month since then. I'd say growth is stagnant or slightly in the positive.
---
Ign TxJeepers 
---
I have a decent aa lever I’ll hook you up
---
Fine by me, it's not affecting my game or anything, nor my flow of caps.
---
I use 5.56 and .45 Mainly. When faring lead, I go everywhere except Lucky Hole, all three silos, Palace, Eastern Regional, VTU, Green County Lodge, Charleston FD, Camden Park and the Monorail Elevator. I also clean up anywhere else that had any other form of lead like Helvetia (cans) Flatwoods (Batteries) and The Flatwoods Red Rocket and it's roof (more cans), Sugar Grove if I'm there. 
---
I no longer need to craft the ammo I use (5.56, .45 and .50 Cal), Instead, I but any ammo of the same I find for 1 cap and resell the same for 2 caps turning a profit.
---
The acid that I am missing out on by nut using it to smelt or gets sold, along with most all of the other junk types in bulk. Some stuff sells faster. I also purposely farm Ballistic Fiber, and Acid along with Lead. The other stuff I take in if it's where I'm farming. 
---
I farm and craft Stimpaks and Disease Cures, and sell those along with any Antibiotics I find in Chem/Aid Boxes. 
---
Not counting any good sells of Legendary Weapons or Armor, plans selling, or random stuff selling, I'm both increasing my stockpile of ammo that I use (Bandolier helps make it near weightless) and I'm steadily bringing in plenty of caps.
---
I've used this method to buy the serum recipes I don't have, and in a good week might hit max caps 2-3 times on my main. 
---
I also play the market in people's vending machines, if someone is selling something low that I can easily vendor or resell for a profit, I do so.
---
So while I may be missing out on some lead from Lucky Hole, I'm more than making up for it in the long run in both ammo and caps, in fact all of my lead goes up for sale because I don't have to craft it for myself anymore.
---
I'll continue to choose to miss out and follow my own route. It works.
---
Yeah I guess I would have to question the buyer as well? What did he think you were doing with the caps while he was paying you? He must have known you were going to loose them if you didn’t tell him anything like “I will be back, I need to go get a different character, etc.....”
---
Unless the name is unique and tied to the account anyway.
---
Reports should be issues in game while things are happening anyway, reporting outside leaves way too much room for reporting the wrong people.
---
:) I'll PM you.
---
That's some very nice work!
---
Open up ypur social menu and tab over to recent, you have options when clicking on their name.
---
I couldn’t agree more! I am now constantly having to fast travel back to camp or simply just log out to protect my caps...What a stupid system and economy....
---
Dropped or put in a container?
---
I got a Bloodied 50 Cal with FFR off the purveyor earlier this week.  I already have Action Hero so quickly put it up and sold it for 2500 caps. 
---
I was shocked
---
Yeah it happens from time to time
---
If you're referring to me, you're on crack, I'm not talking about the t-pose dipshit, Ingorant and irrelevant you are 🤣👌🤡
---
Don't forget height. It is really weird to me that we are all so homogenized
---
I didn't know there was a cap limit until last month, i had never broken 25k yet
---
Why so it can sit in your inventory like mine? You will never be able to use it because it is so bugged and lags so badly everyone around you will yell at you for wearing it and if you are solo like I am you wont want to wear it because you will be dead when the screen in-freezes... Sure go bust your ass like I did to craft it and be proud of the POS you cant even use....
---
ESO does the same thing just fine and they are extremely similar to this server setup.
---
Right because the context surrounding why he said as such dont matter at all. You guys love taking things out of context to fit your narrative a lot huh?
---
I carry a BE bolt action rifle for fun, the fire rate is dogshit but normal shots do around 1600 damage, just the explosion is around 80, sneaking. But you really want to get a higher fire rate gun, it doesnt matter if it has FFR or explosive bullets or whatever. I use a 1\* bloodied handmade and it works fine, but you could get a gauss rifle, combat rifle, fixer  or anything like that with a decent fire rate and you'll be fine.
---
Best source: Ghouls. One violent night, drag it out, whitespring, and Charleston capital. You get the "pharmacist" ghoul, carrying 3 types of meds, usually 2 of each. Other than that, pharma farma. I guess there are some spots with world spawns, but I never get there first.lol
---
Player vending :)
---
I bought 5000 rounds of 5.56 ammo this morning because they were priced at 1 cap each.  You get greedy and price it more I’ll keep walking.  Why people don’t understand this I have no idea.  Price your stuff to sell and it will sell.
---
I'd love if they did it like they do Hunted/Hunter. They already have that system, so it should be easy to implement.
---
I really wanted to find them all while exploring, sort off made it my mission. But after about 13h and 0 buffouts, I gave up, and bought them from a player vendor. Now I only need daytrippers. I don't think I've ever seen them in a shop, player vendor or otherwise. So this will take a while probably. But there's no rush. My automatic fixer Allready does 158 dmg/shot when my health is low. Just earlier, I killed a glowing hermit crab in only 3 shots. Scorshed beasts take about 6.
---
I haven’t seen zero but you bet ur ass I buy up everything under 300 caps per when I’m trying to hit my daily 150.  Though anymore I might only need a few and most of the time I ignore them.
---
Yeah and I do/will I just really loved the concept and hoped I would see it's potential come to fruition. I really thought when the road maps started coming it looked promising but it has started to appear like they are backing off at the least with support for Fo76 and giving up at the worst. Hopefully they start rolling out regular content and true fixes that don't break everything else soon like yesterday soon.
---
Thank you! Could you PM me your IGN so I can add you and drop by?

so THAT's how they got their design for Grognak, it's Todd screaming and running after people to ban them irl

For those of you that have never played MMOs other than WoW, welcome to the world of MMOs.  The people that hate it the most are the most vocal.  Go check out MMOs like Everquest &amp; EQ2 (the granddaddy of all MMOs) and see the hate over there.  But there are still people that play those games because they like them.  Remember, it is not your money that people are playing with, its their own.  If they want to spend it playing FO76 then let them. 
---
I have bought so many games in my life that were a waste of money and this one I got for under most of them and can play as little as I like, or as much as I like.  BECAUSE I PAID FOR IT, not anyone else.  And all the DLCs have been free.
---
Now all the people on line that give the reviews and scream at you about how they got ripped off, probably most of them bought their game off of the monitization of  their channel, which YOU paid for by visiting them. Just think about that

The noises your stuff makes draws mobs. No noisy stuff equals many less mobs attacking your camp= less repair . Voila convenience. Kinda doubt there is a difference though, seems too subtle...

I have 65+ completed trades on the market sub reddit and take it from me, never sell god rolls for caps after you sell one , because it takes a while to burn those kind of caps

I think the point he's making is that Bethesda Softworks and Bethesda Game Studions Maryland are two distinct legal entities? I'm not great on US lawspeech though so not sure.
---
The context is that he exploited several times for research. Then did not report it because someone else in his group already had. But they didn't report that he was also involved in the process. So he did not report an exploit for two days. Now passive aggressively goes on to tell the community "if you encounter a bug don't report it" even though that's what caused his ban lol. You guys sure love putting feels over facts a lot huh?

I use a gamepad, since PC gaming is new to me and it's really hard to switch. I didn't realize that I had opened up the corpse like a stash, so when I hit X a bunch, I didn't take anything but rather gave a bunch of stuff. It happened really fast, and, just when I saw that I had stowed some things, I got killed. I obviously couldn't make it back in time.
---
But do they ever drop daytripper? I imagine you are talking about those ghouls that drop 3x2  different kind of chems, can't remember if I ever got daytripper from them.

That's exactly what I was thinking.
---
You shouldn't drop them in the ground. Put them in a container in the world. Some containers hold more than others, and some are unlimited
---
I got a bloodied fat man and it's pushing out 6k ish with demo maxed out, and still, it barely tickles the queen
---
&gt; Bethesda doesn't consider fallout to be IP that they're fundamentally passionate about.
---
What makes you think BGS is passionate about any IP these days (beyond whatever immediate monetary value can be squeezed out of it)?
---
I have been buying in Bulk Ballistic Fiber from vendor Bots when nearing the Cap Limit.
---
Your Serum idea seems like a better investment.
---
Been playing since day one solo player also. I think the most caps iv ever had is around 2k
---
cool, hope it works out for you
---
I’ll give you one hint.
---
“See the turtle of enormous girth, on his back he holds the earth.”
---
You have no need to apologize for Bethesda's roll out  or their actions at any given time.  It's your money it's your time,
---
They have said that they can't (won't) restore items.
---
Or the hot tub that they already have in game
---
Yeah. I figured.  Lol
---
Quick tip to make some money, buy up any serum that is $300 or less from idiots that don't know that robot vendors will pay $500 for the serums if you CHR is high enough. Hard Bargain Perk @ max and pop a grape mentat or put on some unyielding gear a hurt yourself so you get +3 CHR from the armor(s).
---
It's a neat gun if you have to pull something out for PvP. Don't use one myself but there would be two shots of rad damage I think. Mostly people want ffr gamma guns
---
If I was to guess they will eventually, but extra character slots will probably have to be purchased via the atom shop added to be added to your account. I say this because 76’s monetization seems to be following the route of the Elder Scrolls online’s monetization, where you can pay for extra character slots as well.
---
Idk man I haven't crashed in months
---
Can’t even play of PS4 now with out it freezing non stop
---
Scrip.
---
Don't worry, they don't need the idea to charge us for the ideas.... they'll just take any idea they find on here and come up with the charge them for it part themselves (one of the things that pissed me off about first that got me to stop playing... it's insulting that pretty much except for the first few months of the game any idea the community has asked for/given Beth has been returned with, "but you gotta pay for it (or at least grind and of course atoms keep getting ahrder and harder to get)".
---
The Two Shot effect doesn't affect the radiation damage of a gamma gun.
---
I want Christmas lights that we can string from object to object like power lines
---
I agree. That’d be awesome!
---
Except he isn't upset his account was suspended he is upset that trying to contact support to get it unbanned has been met with a permanent ban. When he has ample proof of his actions **and in the past people in his circle were hit with the automated system and suspended but easily got their accounts back when showing proof of their work.** Might just have a little bit to do with it, but none of that matters right because Bethesda wouldnt possibly shoot themselves in the foot **that** bad by banning such a helpful resource for its playerbase. It's not like this group has had an amazing relationship in the past with Bethesda on other games doing the same thing with helping identify and verify bugs, glitches, and exploits. **Totally** not like he is responding and reacting to a major breach in the trust between modders and Bethesda. They couldn't be **that** out of touch no way!
---
Really fucking amazing how much you guys are cherry picking information.
---
I only trade using straight Swaps for expensive items.
---
This is the reason i hang on to all weaponry with the "Exploding effect" too use as an   
---
 alternative currency..Always trades well with the farmers,and those just looking to make a deal.
---
Out of curiosity can i ask you what the Armour piece was ?
---
Okay I just thought because there were two bursts maybe it worked like that, would be pretty S tier I think lol
---
I'm looking for anyone to do the raids with.  Everyone I was playing with just had no interest in it at all.
---
Fair,  but I notice some commonality in what hes saying/speech patterns
---
"Sell loot boxes to children" is a fairly common Jim gripe when he gets rolling on EA, for example.
---
Dude just the fact that they want videos tells me how little they actually play the game.
---
Whoa!!! Down the rabbit( er reddit) hole I go. Thanks for the link. This going to make my friend insufferable! Lol
---
Wanna do it tonight? I’ll be home later today
---
I find that if you run the game on a Hard Drive rather than an SSD this issue is worse. So if it's possible for you, try and install the game pn an SSD to reduce the amount of freezes.
---
What an arbitrary cap. Maybe Bethesda can't afford more than 2 bytes per character.
---
New feature in 1st: 4 byte cap storage /s
---
The last point is why Bethesda won't do anything unless you submit supporting evidence.
---
You are probably pricing them at 2c per piece or more. Put them a 1c each and watch them disappear within a minute
---
I don't know if I'd agree that he's a good dude. He's something of an asshole, in most of my experiences with him
---
Lol yeah I know
---
Yes sometimes you get daytripper, I think you have a chance at all possible drugs, but some are more rare. Daytripper, calmX, and x-cell show up very rarely for me.
---
That's really reaching for something to be bothered by
---
It would be, yeah. It would basically be a Four Shot lol
---
It just works.
---
Unfortunately not
---
Definitely, plenty of radaway, radx, and stims on just any ghoul, then you get the pharmacist to fill out the good stuff .
---
using the quick wheel can cause lag from 3-15 seconds.
---
That's a raw turn.  
---
Hopefully if anyone grabbed'em they spot this. Good luck!
---
Not particularly bothered by it.
---
Considering people from that particular group have gone on to exploit for self interest, while also enabling dupers in exploit discords (TheGemenaii), not everyone in that group is doing it to help the community my guy. maybe they thought  it was another case of that. But tbh I highly doubt it was, and more than likely the entire process was automated
---
Sure did!
---
It would be nice if could get some extra calmex and psychotats out of it, those are about the only chems I use, and only against the sbq. Everything else dies in mere seconds with this build. And I don't even have a bloodied fixer yet, but this is a nice start.
---
Darn, would add a nice finishing touch to the cabin
---
Absolutely my gt is NomadicCake4746. Give me a shout I'll be on for sure
---
Everytime I accidentally drop my weapon when actually trying to reload, my stomach twists into knots in the 2 seconds it takes for the bag to materialize. Have lost stuff dropping it on purpose( ammo Chems ECT on the fly) and I know I will lose something I really care about one day.
---
***CLUNK CLUNK CLUNK***
---
Yea i guess that doesn't help lol
---
In the very least drop one item to make sure a bag appears.
---
right on
---
How do you drop a weapon while trying to reload?
---
How the turn tables
---
Yeah I don't think there should be a cap either. If you earn it, you earn it. It makes literally no sense when there's other modes of currency as well, like ammo.
---
Never seen stalker effect on a melee weapon. Didn't think it was possible 😂
---
I don’t know if I read this right but did you just say it’s a double XP weekend right now?
---
Yes. Add this to your custom.ini-
---
 \[Particles\]
---
iMaxDesired=250
---
I think you’re probably trolling here, but I’ll bite. If someone goes to the effort to put a zero caps or next-to-zero caps weapon in a dedicated freebie vendor, you can probably say with some certainty that they’re not doing it to save you 30 seconds worth of scrap collection time.
---
Mods
---
Can we please get a unicorn power armor paint job
---
He reads my Reddit comments sometimes so you better take that back right now &gt;:(
---
For real though he's usually pretty cool when I bring up an issue or have a suggestion. He just doesn't like drama, man. He's reminds me of Todd for some reason
---
He's the one that gave himself the reputation to fucking begin with, and it's always been fine to have your opinions about things.
---
it's always been that way for me when loading in.  it fixed itself after about a min or two
---
Nice link, didn't know about the fine dining page.
---
Game Studios -&gt; Games Brand Publisher and THEN there is Zenimax which just have the big money and legal rights to handle their slaves how they want lol
---
Oh shit! I’ll be visiting the white springs real soon 😂
---
So zennimax is the people ruining fallout then?
---
Yea I could almost guarantee that those 900 numbers were from a bloodied lever action. The only thing that could compete would be junkies. Instigating is good for the first shot but anything big like the queen renders it pretty useless. I would try to get a bloodied rifle, even if it’s 1*, and try out a low health rifle build and watch your numbers jump.  Use all 9 rifleman cards, tank killer (which won’t change your numbers visually but let’s you ignore armor) and nerd rage and see if that gets you were you want. Also furious is good, IMO, even tho it’s not full auto. Even if you just land your shots the damage still goes up!
---
Felicia
---
Works on the medic effect also, if you crit alot you get pretty huge heals for you and nearby teammates.
---
Not if you know where to go. I use a 50cal MG with 25% faster fire rate so I easily burn through thousands of rounds a night. I usually have 1 day set as my "Farming" day and I am set for the week
---
Xbox One but I appreciate the offer. I use .45 but don’t use .50
---
Bolstering Powered Sentinel Urban Scout Left Arm
---
dupers, mostly
---
Yeah I should have just traded it at this point for something would have been easier and saved me this misery
---
nice handle
---
On r/market76 you can usually get deals like half a cap per round
---
I don’t think that’s the case. I built my camp in a place no one goes and it has some loot box’s and tool boxes right next to it. It’s almost always empty and items are almost always gone. Either it’s something to do with the timer (not that it was looted by you it glitched but not implemented right). I’m pretty sure something’s telling the system otherwise that it’s looted but it’s not Iv had this problem since they added the timers.
---
Yeah I’m on XB1. I usually buy cheap serums and then pop a grape mentat and sell when I can
---
&gt;recall circuitboards
---
what are these for?
---
It was a Bolstering Powered Sentinel Urban Scout Left Arm
---
if on pc, i'll give you 10k caps for the 10k 5.56  1:1
---
Well, I don't follow their other IP as much as I do Fallout so I can't speak to those authoritatively. While they used to be passionate about Fallout, that's just not the case anymore. It happens, and its unfortunate, but its probably something everyone should be aware of so that they're not unwitting victims, thinking they're going to be getting something that they're obviously not.
---
Folks are lazy or ignorant. 
---
Its like folks always looking for and paying stupid prices for items you could just grind out the campaign and get yourself at the Enclave vendor
---
Are my stats set ok? I'm getting 1000 damage on certain enemies.
---
How do explain all of the magazines and plan locations being looted then? Like I said, i haven't done magazine and plan runs in weeks and I wanted to test it out
---
About what time do you think you will be on. I live in ny I was just curious
---
It ain't easy but I do it once a week or so. A little bit of lag, pipboy to switch weapons, and obsessive reload spamming I guess.
---
.... I just explained it
---
"Keeps it from breaking". I will have to say that from now on.
---
Well again, there was another player at my camp who got near me and went idle. He assumed that I was sending my caps to him. I get it he could have asked if I was good and all but he didn’t know I didn’t know. 
---
And for the record, the guy felt bad when I realized what had happened and he gave me a handful of plans and a couple outfits from the Halloween event (I missed the event)
---
sweet ill have to give my shotguns a try when i get off work, good thing i diddnt sell or scrip them
---
Reminds me of the youtube Nuka-Break show :)
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcgxXnEVVyM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcgxXnEVVyM)
---
You'll have to ask for the Nuka-Breaker to get added for F076 also ;)
---
*Good boi wastelander helped another wastelander*
---
"Everyone liked that"
---
At least you can make psychotats, calmex seems equally rare as xcell, and you cannot craft them.
---
Took me forever to get up there. I’ve sold a few weapons and I always keep my vending machines stocked with stuff at competitive prices
---
if you get shot once ; you can be vatsd immediately after for like 2-3 seconds with that same gun. Plain and simple. That's how it works. You are not any harder to hit. Stealth does not work in PvP. You are automatically highlighted on the pup boy as a red dot. chameleon helps for long range battles. If you get course enough in range you can see anyone who is aggo on your radar.
---
So you're basically saying the private server is recycled If it's registering that it's been looted already. The whole point of 1st was getting a fresh world
---
Awesome post man! If you haven't found the Filthy Casuals yet I'm sure they'd love to read this as well.
---
Bunch of good folks over there: [/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/)
---
I only use the favorite wheel to change weapons, I guess that's why I found it confusing.
---
Sure is! It is Reclamation Day weekend after all!
---
Really!? Well and here I was thinking I was struggling with I had 20k last month haha 
---
I buy cheap serums and then sell them at vendors when I can. And I keep my vending machines stocked
---
not if they can't get close enough. Tesla glows every in stealth boy. so long as you have that our too get killed if they know how to stay back and hit a moving player.
---
I always price my stuff cheap but enough to make something. I price my flux at 70-80 and it always sells out instantly. Meanwhile dude thinks his bloodied pipe is worth 16000, no
---
Yep. Also plan locations, assylum dresses, and explosive crates. Everyday.
---
No I’m saying something is wrong with the looted timer. The looted timer goes by the world and you yourself have a looted timer. The looted timer for you has a problem. If the world was recycled you would see turrets and such at workshops left over from other players but you don’t they are always new.
---
Excellent idea and it could help with cap limit too, you pay as soon as you place the order and can only cancel order if you have cap limit space. That way you can lower your holding caps slightly without losing value, if nevessary put a cap on macimum order you can make.
---
Pretty much do that when I find some cheap
---
I have a single shot fatman, does 935ish, a 2 shot of the same level, did ~325
---
oops! Meant to say perk!🙈
---
About half the time I open my fav wheel it automatically jumps to my emote wheel, so I didn't use it much, except in NW, works fine there..
---
Will try this!
---
Thanks!
---
It was an Urban Scout Left Arm Bolstering Powered Sentinel 3*
---
Yeah true, but I don't need it much, those are reserved for the sbq, and mostly only if there are a lot of low levels joining. I still have 13 calmex, and I usually find a new one before I use one, hehe.
---
Thought it was only on ranged weapons as well... guess you could go bashing with a rifle and call it melee
---
No problem. Check the post and video if you haven't. Learn how to use it to it's full potential.
---
The game remembers the last x-hundred items you looted. This is to prevent server hoping. It also does not seem to spawn in mining veins if you log in next to them. I have a camp next to lead and steel and I have to log out away from camp so they spawn when logging in.
---
This needs to be addressed. The private server isn't worth $13 if it's glitched and nothing spawns in them
---
~~isn't he banned here~~
---
Agree to disagree. I'll knock it off though, cause you asked.
---
But still, all that power, and I have never launched a nuke, lol.
---
He can still read it all
---
So, just as a logical test. If I clean out one area, picking up all of items and searching all containers, then run through Whitespring doing the exact same thing, more than likely everything has Tesla we’d at the first location. Would you consider it exploiting to go back and loot the same items in the same server? I personally do this all the time through the mire into the big, jump to Whitespring, and then back to my start in the mire. Do you think I am exploiting flawed game mechanics? Bethesda is the one who set item and container resplendent frequency, should I just ignore those items and resources?
---
Yah people are crazy I just got a BOS Jumpsuit for 25 caps off some guy
---
Mine veins are classed as containers now aren’t they?
---
20hrs
---
Xbox? I’m always looking for violet flux and that’s a good price my good friend. 
---
But yeah I love going to vendors and seeing these crazy ass prices and wondering who will pay that mess.
---
pros.. you get to eat people
---
cons.. cant think of any
---
Converted munitions factory and fallout 1st gives a wink.
---
Only for role play reasons, besides that no
---
Pros: free food
---
Cons: need to invest a few points so you can eat mutants
---
Oof I scrolled right past your perk layout. If it’s me, I’m getting rid of consentrated fire x3 to x1 and use those perks elsewhere. I have a lot in strength still for carry weight etc. for me I couldn’t survive without bandolier!Also I would pull a couple points from demo expert and put them back in ironclad and fireproof.  I don’t use psychopath and 3 points seems like a big investment for a 15% chance. If you find a VATs crit perk on a lever it will more than make up for that. I have faster crit fill on a handmade and every 3 shots makes a crit.  Just my basic thoughts. Hope it helps.
---
Bethsoft is their marketing firm.  
---
Zenimax is the parent company.
---
That's so dumb though. I can understand If I just did a magazine/plan run a day or two ago. But when it's almost been a month and not 1 plan or magazine can be found?
---
Bethesda Games Studios is the developer, which has many studios (Maryland, montreal, Dallas, Austin)  
---
bethesda softworks is their publisher.
---
Private servers arnt worth it for that anyways. Since you got a timer on loot so that you can’t switch worlds and farm a specific item. I use it for workshops that give me materials for ammo and build ammo. It’s not really worth it now but when they add the ability for modding which they said was coming later then it will be worth it. I only got it for the uniform and scrape box. 
---
Also a good reason to use your world is you can trade items with your other characters by using it. Place the item in a crate or chest and log out and switch to the character you want the item on and go back in and grab it since the world stays for 5 minutes(or 20).
---
Made by bethesda game studios maryland.
---
For me it is like 80% 85% this. Met a guy from Austria, helped each other with some quests and he says," hey I just got this Bffr/fr flamer, I don't use bloodied you want it?" Traded him a 3* scrip weapon.  I have run into griefers, certainly, but so many good people to have fun with, best part of 76!
---
I've been playing private for a couple days while I've been at max caps and the behavior of the server conforms that what I see in the game files that's supposed to happen in a new world. Here's what you're seeing:
---
1. Loot is pickup based, not time based. The game keeps a list of the last 180 items you picked up. It only regenerates them after you've pushed them off the list by picking up more. So you can loot an area, log out for a month, come back and it'll still be 'looted' because your list hasn't changed.
---
2. Premium spawns like bobbleheads, magazines, powerarmor, stealthboys, etc. have very low chances to appear. I think stealth boys are like 20% chance. When you play on a public server, you are seeing inflated spawn rates because of just how many players have been to an area, triggered items to spawn, and then didn't pick them up. I've had a lot of trouble finding power armor on a private server because of this. On a public server, I can always find at least 3 sets in Watoga. On private I've never found more than 1 due to the lower spawn rate because of lack of people coming into that area triggering the spawn chances.
---
The biggest way of telling if you are a new server or not...look at the doors. For example, every train station bathroom door is closed by default. This is almost never the case on a public server. Let me know if you have any questions and I'd be happy to answer as best I can.
---
Agree with this. I've been running a bloodied melee with a bloodied gatling as my ranged weapon and it hits pretty hard for not having any gun related perks. Damage in the mid-200s per round if they see me, 500+ if they don't.
---
Umm almost everyone.
---
[Strong disliked that]
---
Why puny human need mask anyway? Mutant no wear mask, just wear giant baggy diaper for protection.
---
after level 50 level is really pointless. So don't get all excited. I've only people who roll new characters and wait till level 50 to put 40 perk cards in.
---
Yeah except I tested this. Looted Morgantown all the way to Faltwoods. Go to asylum, no dresses. Haven't picked up a dress for over 7 days played. Looted plenty of stuff.
---
Nah ps4. And yeah im like OH YEAH BUDDY LEMME SPEND 7000 ON THIS ASYLUM UNIFORM
---
I wish the neon letters didn't use so much space otherwise id make a sign saying message me to haggle. Maybe someone is willing to buy this gun for 200 not 300 and id sell it
---
I like the game as well. Just the inventory management upsets me.
---
Single player campaign!  A long one.  With tons of lore and side quests.
---
My favorite was a ghoul slayers gamma gun.  Hurt em a little heal em a little. Lol
---
Not sure, maybe in an hour and a half?
---
Google lied to me then
---
This is the main thing that bugs me with FO76...
---
Every time I login, every fusion generator has no cores
---
EVERY! SINGLE! TIME!
---
Either I must have some really crap luck or these things take a week to respawn 
---
I know they are a rarity but its ridiculous now. Been playing since Christmas and only twice have a been lucky enough to find a core in generator 
---
I avoid using PA now cos of it.
---
I've loved it and played it almost daily since December but lately it's been really a chore to play. I pretty much log on exchange scrip and hit a couple spots constantly hoping for a good event to start. Most of the time it's "Tea Time, Breach and Clear, and messenger."I don't even collect caps anymore so my daily activities of grinding for caps is now gone. I just have a hard time doing the same old legendary runs anymore.
---
If you're ps4 i can give you what you need
---
They’re **random** spawns to the locations
---
Same as bobbles, no guarantees, you just got fisted by RNG
---
Worlds are not recycled
---
This post is correct. 20% on magazines and bobbles also.
---
Could you try releasing a service that isn’t a complete ripoff that negates your previous promises of all future content being free aside from cosmetic items?
---
That would be fantastic. Pass it along to your team, your company is a greedy shit heap.
---
No, not at all, you are not in any way abusing game mechanics in your example
---
Microscopes for crystal or crystal decanters.
---
 Morgantown high school for some easy microscopes or climb the tree in Tangara town  to enter a tunnel to mine a ton of crystal ore.
---
It's ok those cores are 25%. Get some full ones by taking over a power plant
---
Gameplay and all I still love it. I'm just getting bored of doing the same ole thing every day while I wait for Wastelanders to come out
---
a fool and his junk are easily baited. grow a spine and don't let others steal your cool. Pride is worthless in the wasteland. It won't fix your gun or make your bullets.  Pride or junk Which would you rather have ? Swallow the pride and take your time to stash and pull out your PvP specific weapons and gear. Watch your target on map and strike when they don't see you coming. Enter and exit quickly. Do not longer. Savor the victory.
---
“Membership benefits”
---
Funny way of saying “content we promised free before we suckered everyone out of the base $60.”
---
180 items I think.
---
If you need to submit evidence you can go to the page to open your game created ticket and extrapolate on the issue as the system is right now.
---
Only played ng NW at the moment
---
Well, with all the flaws in mind, it's not really that bad of a game.
---
However, the game really lacks element to keep players playing. Sure I still play but I find myself aimless, and that's one of the reasons that cause players to stop playing. At the end people are all playing the trading game, but now players are not even doing that as much as before.
---
Food is everywhere. Perk cards are valuable.
---
I can't really see a benefit to it unless you just like it for the flavour (no pun intended) or RP purposes, but let's be frank the RP opportunities in this game are pretty slim.
---
For a short term crystal fix: go into the white spring. Look on the tables for magnifying glasses and crystal decanters. Occasionally, venders will sell bulk crystal or cameras which can be scrapped for it. If you need more crystal, try lucky hole mine. Although you will need acid to smelt it down. 
---
Copper can be found in lamps or stew pots. Check any kitchen area you happen upon for the big pots. Alternately, there’s a few workshops where you can place copper extractors. But these would also require acid to smelt.
---
I have had some bags appear far away from where I was standing but sure you would have found it
---
turn pacifist on and stay out of Workshops. It's a PvP Zone. the notification warns you before you take them.
---
I just throw anything I don't need or use up for low caps. Like, 5c for most plans, 1c for ammo.
---
Dresses only have a small chance to be there for each person who visits the area. If you have multiple toons you can try loading each one in to see if they trigger the item spawn.
---
So what’s with the people selling items for 99999999c?
---
nocturnal leather for his night missions and going Slayer for his white springs farming sessions.
---
Thanks, but I'm on Xbox 🙂
---
Amazing build, Very original! I’ll send a request tonight GT Grimsbronth
---
Cheers, will try Whitesprings 👍
---
survival was like this all the time. imagine that
---
 containers and junk aren't on a timer this explains. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jnc0FQ3QgkUO6HZObeeGksDTPwno1Fa-Bt7uXeqWib4/edit#   I have noticed magazines barely ever spawn though.
---
Why are the explosive crates unlocked?
---
If loot is instanced, why would other people entering an area change the spawn for you?
---
yes, it really sucks man. That was really a lot of fun.
---
it's fun as hell right
---
That would kill you or you would wake up in fallout 5
---
If you're paying 13 a month, every private world should be refreshed without all that last 100+ pick up crap. You should be able to server hope as much as you want
---
Aside from mischief night that's actually the first time that's happened to me in a while.. perfect timing.. lol
---
So wierd, I saw him 4 time with 3 different toons in one day. Other than meat week that almost equals the total number of times I have seen him in 10months of play, Lol
---
I'm never pre-ordering a game or buying a game in the first month, I'm never assuming a publisher will fix bugs in the future
---
that build it's really trash
---
meat stuck in my teef
---
this guy here, he's got a point
---
I enjoyed it at first. But I got tired of constant crashing/disconnects. But once fallout 1st came out despite all the problems that still exist I just hung up my hat and un-installed.
---
This website is cute as fuck. Why? Lol
---
Sorry should've said - I'm not subscribed - not sure I'm going to but we'll see
---
That's fine no rush
---
Dude right there it says per character lock out and it even says containers and world items .... that’s exactly what I’m talking about. And on top of that the world itself has a timer.
---
I run solo 90% of the time, and I use an anti armor stealth build, using vanguard gear. I do VERY well without using bloody.
---
long good build defense there bud
---
Fat Man's pretty good, though. With rank 3 Demo Expert you can potentially do *1,300* damage per nuke and outright OHK most enemies. Trying to use it on something like Scorchbeasts? Not so much. Deathclaws too, as even with a AA one you'll likely need 2 nukes to kill a Level 91 one
---
Do I really have to reiterate myself again?..... He explicitly states he isn't upset with the automated response, he said he expected it and it's a normal occurrence for people working on reporting glitches for it to happen.
---
**What he is up in arms about and what a lot of people are upset about is what happened afterwars where his account is permanently banned even though in the past all they had to do was show proof and the suspension would be lifted.** The suspension for a few days is automated, the permanent ban is someone reviewing the case and deciding a permanent ban is needed.
---
Which is honestly pointless if he wanted to keep playing as he states he had 6 accounts. If Bethesda was aiming to remove an exploiter they need to get rid of all his accounts or they are just potentially losing revenue as they might have banned an Fo1st account and the dude can just log into a different one.
---
yeah it's really bad
---
The crates being unlocked would be based on your activity. I think there's a 40 container list that it tracks. The spawns I'm talking about are the items that you can pick up, not containers. Containers are instanced, loose junk laying around are shared. When it's time for the game to spawn in an area, it spawns everything in that's supposed to be there every time. Then it rolls chances on the premium items. Then it looks at the player that's there. If those items are in the player's recently looted list, it de-spawns those items. Usually this happens so fast you never see it but on a laggy server, you can watch it happen. 
---
Now, say I'm on a public server that just booted up. I go to Watoga train station. The game will spawn all normal loot and roll chances on the power armors around town. Only one of them spawns. I don't touch it but then FT away to Whitespring and there's no one left in Watoga, after a while, that cell will become inactive. Someone else comes along to Watoga. That one PA that I caused to spawn in will still be there but now it will re-roll the other spawns. This process keeps repeating all day long. So if no one has picked up any PA sets,  you can easily go and find one at every location. This isn't the case on a private where you are the only one triggering the spawns. What you get is what you get.
---
plot twist it's not for protection
---
Love the game, but it's in dire need of new content. Sick of bugs and disconnects. Wastelanders not being out is killing them right now, whether it's their fault or not. The Atom Shop makes no sense most of the time. Lastly, Reclamation Day was a wasted opportunity to do, well, anything.
---
Overall, it feels like we're just spinning our wheels right now, and that's not a good thing.
---
Imho it really depends on whether you want to invest 3 perks in power user.
---
Fusion / plasma cores are too damn heavy, but their weight becomes trivial with the perks.
---
Generally speaking the energy heavies are super ammo efficient, but their dps is lower than say, a 50cal or LMG.
---
Really I would put it down to flavour, I like the lasers they look cool, so to me it's fun shooting 200 green laser ammo to bring down a scorchbeast vs like 30 amo from a 50cal.
---
They're also coming out with a nuka shine replica. If the bottle is glass I'm definitely gonna grab it.
---
we all float down there
---
I love using it. It does incorrectly display melee buffs though. All melee buffs stack to my understanding. There are 3 15% buffs that stack to 45% damage boost but it calculates it as 15% for 3x as long.
---
Meee too
---
Got a Stalker's FSS RW Super Sledge. Literally the only reason I haven't trashed it is because the FSS and RW make up for the Stalker's effect
---
Yeah I’ve had that happen too. The bag was literally empty. Lol
---
The game has stuttered on PC since release, nothing seems to fix it, in a year of trying and 2 different PCs...
---
are gross on that as well? ie I take some tatos from someone's camp, I'm not stealing from them am I?
---
Both can make you fly.
---
Enjoying it, still like the game, but as many have mentioned it is the lack of new content (mainly lack of interesting daily content and new public events) that makes it less interesting to log in right now. Still do some gaming each day, sometimes some NW. But mostly waiting for new content and Wastelanders at this point.
---
Yup. Workbenches for me take forever to display the menu as well. This is intermittent, not full time. Also have people getting kicked as well.
---
I have observed this as well
---
Haha it has been so long I have a four hour download so I guess my comeback will be delayed. But if I see ya kicking around I will tag along someday.
---
No prob man lol you're never going to hear the end of it lol
---
What are you trying to do?
---
You should tell sinisterHAND to try build a camp like that and then see how it turns out
---
NO WAY! awe thankyou my faith is restored! I started to think it was just an atomic shop item.
---
Low health builds are the strongest but max health builds are strong enough to deal any enemy. A solid junkie build is strong enough to kill most common infantry  enemies in one shot. My Junkie/Explosive Auto Railway kills a Behemoth in less than a second.
---
And here we see a self entitled Snowflake in his natural habitat showing his alpha territorial presence that everything should just be giving to him no matter what
---
A freebie folks were supposed to get when they ordered special edition long ago.
---
could you go to the local hardware store or electronics store and get some more screws?
---
Worse than when you are cooking or using workbench?
---
This has been happening since day one. My theory is the more legendary weapons you have the worse it gets.
---
it's legit. many a scrip gone
---
If yo don't mind me asking,why not? I solo a silo about once a day. Not really that difficult most of the time( rng robot defenders spawn can be crazy sometimes.)
---
Indoor outdoor on off switch for garage door
---
Your mad at yourself and not Bethesda? This might be a first for reddit
---
No fucking shit you're a joke. Pay 9.99 for the one year anniversary dlc
---
The gamma gun has like ~150+ base damage and ~50ish radiation damage. I can't remember the exact number, but you are hurting way more than helping them.
---
The engine. That would solve many things at once.
---
Ship camps are so hot right now.
---
I ran collision course yesterday on a whim and got a rare pink baseball bat in the cargo.  Fun times!
---
TIL there is a character limit.
---
Dude fuck off with that snowflake bs. 13 a month should have more benefits. Right now, I see no difference between adventure mode and private world
---
Awesome build!
---
It's fun.
---
You can kinda do it, but you need a friend
---
Build an electronic wall
---
Have your friend shoot you, you shoot them back
---
Then your friend breaks your wall
---
Do not repair it
---
Build a pressure switch in the middle
---
Repair your wall
---
Hook up the switch to the door
---
Hey presto
---
You can have one switch inside and one outside the garage door to open it if thats what you mean.
---
I get them all the time. Instascrip
---
Love the game, but it really needs some new content.  Especially new solo content.
---
I don't care about Nuclear Winter.  Didn't care about Survival Mode.  Dungeon raids, ehh.  Biv and Pioneer Scouts were OK, but they felt a bit like busywork.  The new camera really felt like busywork with no purpose.  The Sheepsquatch DLC was good.  Fasnacht and Mischief Night were fun enough, although both had some technical issues.
---
So really, a year after release, and the Sheepsquatch DLC was the only new stuff that I was super happy with.  Other additions//updates (player vending, for example) were good too, but I personally was really hoping for more quests/storylines to be added.
---
They need to knock it out of the park with Wastelanders, and also to add things like Modding and Persistent Workshops to Fallout 1st.
---
That’s what I have but that’s not a 3-way switch. A 3-way switch allows you to turn on or off at both switch locations
---
Great story mate I love hearing stuff like this!
---
Yeah I loot everything and take at least one thing from every container i come across and it all respawns when I relog.
---
Not enough endgame content for sure. I still play obsessively because I have that incurable disease called completionism,  or "gotta catch em all-itis". Want the rare outfits, and am still beating my head against the brick wall of "Plan: Plasma Grenade". Not to mention Plan:Stimpack Diffuser and Plan:Bear Arm.
---
I forget what weapon i once sold at a loss because of that damn cap.. I recall losing about 3k.  I quickly took down my vending machines to make sure i didn't have more loss
---
Damn. Maybe I should have preordered the game back then lol. I got it like 2 months ago xD
---
I also play solo (with exception of public events) and run a "Glass Cannon" set up, just me and my BE Handmade.
---
It works very well, I have ungodly strength and dps, but it takes its toll. Spend a good bit of time looking for my death bags, but that is a small inconvenience for the overall gains
---
Oh I understand what you mean now. My bad 🙃
---
You can put a switch on each side, but it’s easy to lock yourself in if the outside switch is off as well as the inside. One of them has to stay on
---
Just have to re-enable them in the emotes section of the atom shop.
---
Aarnhodlt or some such.
---
Thank you, makes me reflect that I've been somewhat of a game introvert so far, need to team up more. IRL I'm a bit of an extrovert majority of the time. Lol
---
This comment leads me to believe you have eaten players. :P
---
Con: I believe you cant use it in power armor
---
It is how it works now, but it is not how it worked before.
---
There is a squirrel one that matches it, but nothing better.
---
Doesn’t even have a cause for me. I just randomly have moments where I’ll freeze up for 5 seconds or so just walking around
---
Imo whatever works for you.
---
sneak/vats with ranged weapons
---
Nice :)
---
You can catch diseases and it's jotnreliable for health in places with no humanoid enemies, like silos
---
And one farm in South Savage Divide, part of the cryptids questline, with the radstag experiment.
---
I'm the same mate I've only recently been teaming up with a guy I found on Facebook! The game was getting somewhat boring but playing with a friend is great I love giving out junk loaning armor sets etc.
---
By now bored to death of it. Waiting for wastelanders. But just... the world doesn’t change. And it just doesn’t feel as interesting as fo4.
---
Food drink and Chem reduction most likely. Believe it or not I know people who can blow through 150+ super stims and quantum in an hour or two of PvP. But youll never be able to fast travel to or from the fight if you tried to carry even just that, armor ammo and 2 weapons. Especially if you use the armor or insulated backpack which barely holds anything. Sometimes weight reduction is survivability lol
---
Well... hasn't everyone?
---
This is the correct answer, I have F1st since day one and there is no such thing as used servers.
---
Until we actually have it, and it's actually free, no point in bringing it up. For all we know it can be a paid expansion like Elsweyr for ESO that you can either buy it, or pay for the subscription.
---
So don't fucking bring up "OH WE'RE GETTING ONE!" cause it means nothing until we actually have it.
---
Proper bloodied builds hardly die ime. Have over 450 Dr and Er only real weak point is ghouls and those high level gusties that I though had been patched but apparently have come back. 
---
I one shot almost all enemies with the exception of scourched beasts , queens, and tge like. Only real difference is I use melee while you use ranged. I used to be ranged, but felt forgotten overall. Melee has always been shown more love by the devs, and that kinda sucks.
---
I get them every time I do breach and clear, didn't think it was "rare" till a friend was with me and he freaked out lol.
---
Lesson learned mate it's a pain in the ass! Once you go over 30 it really should be banked somehow! It's a god act on Bethesdas half
---
Lately I've lost the love I had for it. I continue to play because my friends are there. Im sure ill be back but lately with everything else thats been happening I'm kind of depressed with 76.
---
There are lighthouse statues in the base of the lighthouse made of copper.
---
Actually good advice I need to remember to do that
---
Prime BE LMG if you want to drop them instantly, 50cal will work nicely as well, Frank Gatling gun if you want to do it cheap.
---
Literally happens on vanilla game, but ok champ.
---
I had a player stop me at low level, and dropped a B.O.S. underarmor, WITH the second upgrade on it!  I was around lvl 10 and hadn't figured out that outfits cover your armor yet. He left me a msg on Xbox, that if I ever wanted anything BOS, to hit him up.
---
How have you made this masterpiece?
---
How do I re-enable them?
---
Function for an Offline/Locally Hosted mode
---
Open the atom shop go to emotes click on the emote u want to reenable.
---
Only reason I play it instead of 4 is because of the friends I have. They make it passable. I will forever find it difficult to be excited for this games future however.
---
I traded with a guy a few nights ago, a heavy CA Unyielding +1 Strength arm piece for some 5.56. After chatting with him, he's a father and only gets a little time to play and mostly grinds for materials to make ammo to trade for better gear (he said he has terrible RNG luck in game). I gave him 1000 gunpowder, 20 Bulk acid, 40 Bulk cloth and 50 Bulk steel. I wanted him to have fun in game rather than grinding materials.
---
There might be some you aren't aware of. I believe there's a row of 3 or 4 wall safes at the bank, but not all of them are functional each round.
---
viable?  What exactly does that even mean?  It's a perk that lets you eat people.
---
Makes it easy to get the daily level up challenge.
---
I'd bring survival mode back.
---
This is the way I think of it: Battlecry studio needed a game to make after BattleCry got canceled, Bethesda Game Studios wanted to make a multiplayer game that wouldn't disrupt a single player narrative (which is why it's so focused on multiplayer) so they collaborated on a game that they could pass on to the multiplayer developer.
---
Fallout 76 is not an indication of the direction the studio's going. It may seem like a culmination of all the changes many people dislike about the evolution of their games, but this title was always intended to be different. It tried no human npcs because it had other players who could fill that space. It has more bugs because of its multiplayer, this is despite sharing an upgraded engine with Fallout 4, Bethesda's least buggy game in over a decade. It has microtransactions to fund expansions, and they're mildly aggressive and pricey because not everyone will buy them, but the DLC still needs to be funded. 
---
They even announced 2 single player focused games in advanced, something they've never done before, to assure people that they're not becoming a multiplayer studio. 
---
That said, it could be possible for any of their future single player games to have multiplayer.
---
Yep I'm a father myself plus I work remote in mining on a 7/7 roster so don't get to play as often as I'd like so I'm positive this guy really appreciated your help man good on ya! The grind is real 😋
---
I got it! Thank you so much!
---
Upvote for using “wizard”
---
Wow, you’re replying to comments on a post over 80 days old, but whatever you say Chief
---
i use it always.  just today i was out of food and killing some scorched. mostly though its just fun and has a very satisfying sound to it.
---
It kinda sucks. I hate the overboard monetization and lack of interesting content. Plus I miss shooting human NPCs. Or other players in Survival.
---
Or you misread google.
---
You absolutely nailed it. I genuinely love what this game tried to be, and stuck with it for the first couple months, but you nailed all the reasons I've stayed away since then other than to check back occasionally to see if it has improved enough.
---
2 mains &amp; 8 mules, sitting on millions, most I ever lost due to a group of 4 trolls trolling my vendors was about 5k. They all had max caps and went on a buying spree thinking I was AFK. Lost a small amount of caps, but was in the middle of fast traveling to a vendor to burn off some caps before I realized what was going on...they just keep spamming the buy button and by the time I loaded in I had lost 5k at most.
---
The toughest part of 76 for me is having this kind of group( though smaller) who are now slowly drifting off to other games. I do keep finding new folks to play with but sometimes the group is especially fun.
---
Initiating *Encryptid*
---
Appreciate it thanks
---
This is a pretty big issue in this community. Because the developer shares a name with the publisher, people can't differentiate the two. Bethesda Game Studios has always been the developer of their own games, from Arena to Fallout 3 to 76. And Bethesda Softworks has always only been the publisher of all the games under the Zenimax umbrella, including Fallout 4, Doom, Wolfenstein and the rest.
---
Boodied does the most damage.  There are plenty of other options that are completely and totally viable as well, but nothing will deal more damage and as that seems to be your primary concern have at it ;)
---
or dont leave it for everyone to take
---
1 star items can sell but not for a huge amount.  Like a basic AA, B, TS or J weapon has some worth for new players but generally speaking only for the better weapons.  
---
A ts gamma gun is pretty far from a meta option though.  handmade, fixer, .50 cal, lmg, lever, those are probably the most overall in demand weapons that you can probably sell a 1\* for a few hundred caps.
---
I was scorned by the game's issues at launch and couldn't get over the bad times to see any of the improvements. I have a friend who won't stop talking about FO76 and is even doing a paper on it for their college course, so who knows. They might convince me to pick it up in the future, but its gonna take a hell of a lot to do so after my previous experience.
---
Yw :)
